0,What is the role of a QA tester on a Scrum team?,"I've recently added a QA tester to our new Scrum team. The tester comes with a lot of experience in automated testing and is capable of scripting, light coding, etc. He will be using automation tools, such as Selenium, to assist with the QA process. However, I am a little unclear where to draw the line in his responsibilities. Also, how do I incorporate QA into the whiteboard?  1) Role and Responsibilies   Should he be involved in helping the developers identifying what unit tests to write for a given module? Should he be involved in determining code coverage for testing? Should he be responsible for the Continuous Integration tool? Is he the person who declares a story as ""Done""? Is he in charge of making sure that a story is testable, and therefore valid?   2) QA on the Scrum Whiteboard   Should there be a separate column for QA on the whiteboard? Or is it better to mark a story in some other way to show that it is being tested? Should bugs be identified as tasks within the story, say on a red post-it, or should they be a separate story unto themselves?  "
1,Unfinished Stories in a Sprint,"Every so often, we find ourselves with a story that, for some reason, does not get completed during a sprint. This could be for a variety of reasons, such as a tricky bug, but the end result is that the story is not done.  I understand that unfinished stories can be an indicator of bad story writing, but despite our best efforts though we do come across an unfinished story from time to time. So far, we have just carried the story over into the next sprint.    Is this the right thing to do? Also, are the full points earned upon completion in the next sprint or will this skew the velocity of that sprint? "
2,What are typical legal and technical documents that you would provide with a solution as a vendor?,What typical legal and technical documents do you provide with a solution as a software vendor?  Documents would be like:   SLA Privacy Policy Terms and Conditions   When you are responding to a proposal which documents do you typically include? 
3,Kanban for multiple projects,"We've been using [website]Given that we are a startup, we frequently have to juggle multiple projects back and forth within a given time period. For example, this week we have to update a partner website, develop the backend for our main product, as both web, iOS and android clients. The three clients have different engineers working on them.  I would like to use a kanban board to visualize our current sprint. I find that they allow me to more easily see progress.  I don't know how to manage the fact that we have multiple clients. It seems like it would make it hard for our mobile guy to know which mobile tasks are remaining. They might not be next to each other.  I also like that we have little mini-MVPs within a given sprint. Normally, if we finish one, we can start working on the next one, but we want to get them released in between. They don't line up with sprint boundaries.  Should I use separate boards per mini-project? Per web/iOS/Android clients?  Is there a good digital kanban that allows you to order individual boards like a backlog? "
4,Should I do reference checks on an experienced candidate?,"We're looking at a candidate who has 20 years of experience (largely consulting) who we're thinking of hiring.  Our hiring manager thinks we shouldn't check references saying things like ""It's not prudent to check references for someone with over 20 years of experience. They're mainly intended for younger candidates with a limited track record"" and ""It's a little bit like asking for GPA. It's not something you do for people with that much experience. It's partly offensive and partly not all that useful.""  I personally disagree with him and don't think we should make exceptions for any candidate.  Do you do reference checks regardless of experience? If so, what are some arguments in favor of it? If not, why not?  Slight modification  Thanks for the replies - I'll select an answer soon but I'd like to get some more input.  His argument now is that somebody who has had many years of experience and been promoted more than once does not need reference checks because their history of promotions tells you that they are a good employee, and the references they supplied would most likely be people who promoted them. Arguments against that? "
5,Visiting daily scrums - dos and don'ts,"When you visit one of the daily scrums whilst being in a role above those scrums, do you usually participate as a beholder or, do you also speak like all scrum team members: What did you do yesterday and what are you going to do today?  If so, why and how do you describe the things which are not yet to be broadcasted to the whole team (for example, preparation of reorganisation, issues with stakeholders and anything else that everyone does not need to know [yet])? "
6,How much detail should the solution design have in Foundations in DSDM?,"In the DSDM Atern lifecycle, here.  In the foundation phase it states one of the objectives is to:     To start designing the solution architecture and identifying the physical or infrastructural elements of the solution.   My question is, what exactly does this mean?    Does it mean driving into a lot of detail on certain stories if we don't know enough to estimate under 100 points to the point where we may product a prototype to pass the foundation check point? "
7,What is the difference between Vision and Scope Document and a Project Charter?,What is the difference between Vision and Scope Document and a Project Charter? I think it is pretty much the same. Isn't it? 
8,Strict or pragmatic Scrum?,"Do you practice Scrum strictly after its rules or are you going a more pragmatic way, picking out the bits that suit you/your environment best, maybe mixing it up with other methodologies ? In other words, do you bend Scrum to suit your environment or do you change your environment to suit Scrum ?  Which way you think is the better ? "
9,"Using MS Project for recurring monthly, retainer based project work","We started using MS Projects recently in our small consulting firm, and one of the types of projects we have are retainer(SLA) based, where the client has a contract for a certain amount of hours per month. Now my question relates to creating tasks on a Project we created for this client, what we are currently doing is we create a main task for each month and assign the amount of hours to that tasks, and then we create sub tasks on that, one for general development and one for business intelligence, what we want to do is share the 150 hours between the two tasks without having to specify the amount of hours for each, as we don't know before hand how they will be split for any particular month.  Currently the main task has 150 hours and both the two sub-tasks on that main task has no hours allocated towards it, each with its own resource assigned to a task.  But when I open PWA and view the projects it says 300 hours has been allocated towards this project.  So what would the best practice be for something like this? And if you have some sources on the internet of where to find more information for something like this, please let me know?  Thanks "
10,Best reply to project manager's failed humour,"Whenever a manager ask us to perform a task, we often ask ""when do you need this by?"" Some managers try to be smart and often say: ""yesterday"".  What would be the best comeback response? "
11,"Is Kanban a part of Scrum, and is it simply the task board?","I am new to Scrum and Kanban. So far, I understand that the Task Board is something that is originally from Kanban, but I am using an online Scrum tool that also also offers that board.  Is the Task Board with columns like ""To-Do"", ""Doing"", and ""Done"" the only thing in Kanban? Is it actually a part of modern Scrum? "
12,Information to keep in a risk register,"In the PMI process, they include a document called a Risk Register. It contains a list of all the risks -- realized and unrealized -- including some fields like probability and impact.  For software projects, what kind of fields should we include in a risk register? Mine tend to have: - Risk name - Risk severity (low/moderate/high/terminal) - Risk probability (low/medium/high) - Risk state (eg. accepted, monitor, minimized) - Risk trigger (how do we know this risk occurred?)  What else can you put in there that has value, without creating a huge, bloated documented?  This question is somewhat intended as a community wiki question. "
13,How can project management process influence the product management process?,"I experience projects in which Product Managers delivered the  requirements with a great delay. In other cases, the requirements were delivered only for 1 or 2 sprints, then the PM left the company. Another situation was when a product manager gave us requirements at high level, and when asked details, he would endlessly speak without answering to the point.   I wonder now how can the project manager process influence the  product management process, bearing in mind that project managers are  under the constrains of budget and time?  What kind of levers are most useful in these kind of situations? "
14,"How to Estimate Scope, Cost and Budget for Developing a Phone App","I have some questions regarding how to handle bidding for a project, and how to structure the contract for the project.    How can I find the answers to the following questions:   How many people (this includes programmers, designers, project managers, etc.) does this scope of a project usually involve? What would be the ballpark cost for developing this kind of app? If the cost is above 10-15k, what would be the correct amount of work to give the client, if the client only can afford a very small portion of the original cost? This is hypothetical, but let's say all of what was explained was near completed yet the client hasn't provided an IP agreement or any sort of contract, yet demands the work be turned over within the next week. Payment has been made but at a ""very small portion"" of the original cost, does the client have grounds to take all the work?   How should I proceed in answering those questions so I can define the scope of this project? "
15,What software can I use to complememt our useless company task planning and time tracker tool?,"We have Remedy-based software that is used for task planning and time tracking. No real project management features are supported, but we need to use it because our budgets are calculated using the software.  I would like to introduce an effective set of tools to improve our project management process while keeping it aligned with the ""master"" planning/tracking software. An idea would be to use something different (e.g. Basecamp or similar) and then implement some integration layer to the DB.  How do I start? Any advice? "
16,What is the difference between Scrum and XP?,Everything is in the title: What is the difference between Scrum and eXtreme Programming? Is it possible to have a simple but explicit explanation? 
17,Should project management and business analysis be seperate roles and teams?,"We are doing a review or several teams and in certain cases the PM and BA roles are combined into one and in other cases they are seperated out into completely independent teams.  I am looking at this from 2 angles.  1. Whats best for the efficiency of the project?  Obviously there are specific analysis and project mgmt responsibilities but we have found that in many cases (depending on size of project, etc) that the person who is doing the analysis is in the best position to really manage the project (as the analysis is what is raising up questions and issues and risks, dependencies, etc) versus separating this into two different roles which would provide an extra hop and potential disconnects.  The other question is ""can a project manager really ""manage"" a project if they are not really well versed in the domain knowledge?  In many cases we find people are tagged as one label but if you look at the dynamic of the project they are crossing the boundaries of these functions  2. What is best for the individual people?  For example, in certain teams a junior BA grows up to be a project and then program manager so they are really different stages in the same team (versus separate roles).  In other cases people don't seem to want to do one or the other.  That being said a PM should have a decent understand of the space (goes back to the question above, can you be a great PM if you are not well versed in the domain which mean you must have done some time doing analysis in understanding the space  In many cases the answer might be ""depends on the people"" but I am curious around how rigid or open people are on this question based on experiences. "
18,Satisfying an external auditor when using Agile,"My company is an ISV and occasionally, prospective customers (especially in life sciences) insist on sending in auditors to check over our software development processes.  We are starting to implement Scrum/Agile and my CEO is very concerned about how such an auditor would react to this. His concern (which I share to some extent) is that an auditor would expect to see a signed-off specification document against which the software is developed and then tested, and they wouldn't be happy with an incremental approach which doesn't really deliver a full specification at all.  Does anyone have any experience in this respect? Is it usually necessary to fudge the issue slightly by ""signing off"" a user story, or producing a retrospective specification document etc.? My only defense to the CEO so far is that agile is almost universal in software development, so they are bound to accept it as valid, but I don't know whether this is true.  I have seen some discussion about ISO 9000 and the general consensus seems to be that agile is not incompatible with that, but I don't think that's really the same question because my sole motivation is to be sure we can satisfy an auditor. FWIW We are not ISO 9000 certified and have no intention of doing so, and auditors have not had a problem with this in the past.  "
19,When are Gantt diagrams useful?,"Since managing projects, I've never figured out the utility of this tool.  We must do it before working, but for me, it's impossible to fill it (even a little) before the end of the project.  When I ship my report, clients seems to be displeased if the Gantt diagram is absent.  Can I have some help with this? How to properly manage this tool, dealing with clients about this? "
20,How do you measure risk?,"As a related question to: What's the best definition and explanation of project risk?  What is the most useful way of measuring risk? I've been thought it's best to measure it in additional monetary cost to project budget. By writing down all 'risk events' and their related probabilities and incurred costs, we can calculate the 'risk value' of a project at any given moment in time.  This method seems a bit unintuitive to me though (does not really go well with the word 'risk'). I'd like to know what other methods of measuring risks are there. "
21,A One Man Project Methodology?,"I'm currently doing a my final year project and have used the methods employed by the Scrum project methodology to break down my requirements into manageable parts.  I have a question as to whether there are methodologies that are used which are catered to a one man team? The way I did my project was by using the structure of scrum in my own situation, i.e. I made the product backlog, ran through what I could accomplish in one sprint, implemented it, assessed it and moved on to the next once the work was acceptable.  But is that how it works if you have to tackle a project on your own? You pick up the structure of a methodology that would suit you and then run with it? Or are there other methodologies out there that are for ""freelance developers""?  I can justify for myself that the technique I used was appropriate for me and it worked, but I just want to know if it is acceptable, professionally, to adopt a technique which is built around a team effort and use it individually.  I'd appreciate any feedback "
22,How do you maintain a product burn down chart while not being plan driven?,"As a scrum master, how do you keep a burn down chart up to date without forcing your team into become 'plan-driven'?     (What does 'plan-driven' mean?) [website]Our team is currently keeping a scrum burn down chart for our project.   I, however, want to avoid over planning.   Any advice that you could offer would be helpful.     Thank you! "
23,How can I improve the following email template?,"I have just started utilizing an approach that I refer to as the 3 in 3 email.  It is nothing groundbreaking but simply an email issued every Monday and Wednesday asking 3 questions regarding the next 3 days.   What do you need from the Planning Manager in the next 3 days? What blocks do you have that the Planning Manager can help with? What facilitation can the Planning Manager support you with in the next 3 days?   This email is delivered to a team of 18, both laterally and vertically throughout the organisation.    Is there a way to improve it and do the questions feel useful within a project or delivery environment?  It does not replace face to face communications but is used to bridge the gap the between Daily Stand Up and the Weekly Progress Update which are standard delivery ceremonies.   "
24,What makes SMART-goals useful?,"Often is recommended to have your goals SMART (specific, measurable, attainable, realistic and time-bound). Is this recommendation a good one? Why I should use SMART-goals? What is the benefit of them? "
25,How to deal with customer (dis)satisfaction and formal agreements amidst large rotation in small teams?,Working in outsourcing model I wonder what are your experiences with fluctuation on vendor's team level.  Assuming smaller teams (up to 20 people) when team rotation on vendor's side reaches e.g. 30% or more over a year or two customer will feel dissatisfaction caused by changes in the team and need to introduce new people to both domain and technical knowledge. This generates costs on both sides. On one hand from customers perspective it seems safe to put such information/requirements into contract but on the other hand IT market shows that team changes on vendor side are happening and it is a challenge to keep the same team for a couple of years.   On the other hand - rotation on team level has it's benefits for both vendor and end customer.  How do you deal with this on vendor level? How do you deal with formal contracts with end customers? 
26,How to estimate amount of work/man hours for an unfamiliar task?,"Sooner or later we come across a task in our project, with which we are totally unfamiliar ('we' as in PM, but also possibly the staff assigned to do this particular task).   How can we estimate amount of time/work/resources needed to complete such a task? What margins of error should we assume? "
27,Standard document to record decisions? (PMBOK),"This is a hypothetical scenario:  I was assigned to manage a software development project. I already have an approved project charter, stakeholder registry, requirements documentation and a WBS.  I had a meeting with my development team in order to brainstorm a solution based on the information we gathered so far. During the meeting somebody had a brilliant idea about how to fulfill several difficult requirements.  The question : Is there a PMBOK standard document for this decisions? The WBS dictionary? Scope document? The Project Management Plan? Or somewhere else?  I found at least one similar question about this topic but it provided only suggestions like meeting minutiae and not a PMBOK’s specific answer. "
28,Adding sub-tasks to stories in Confluence?,"I have just started as PMO Coordinator of several teams. All teams add sub-tasks to stories/requirements, and they do all this in Jira (create requirements/stories + DEV team add sub-tasks), and all of them do that their own way, without following any specific format for user story creation, with in many cases lead to confusion as requirements aro not clearly exposed.   So I wanted to use Confluence as a home for our stories. But my question is, how can I add sub-tasks to this stories? Is it possible to do so in Confluence? Or do you have any other ideas regarding how to unify requirements/stories creation across all teams? I just thought of confluence since in my previous jobs I used it and it is a good way of creating clear stories. "
29,What are the minimum viable Agile practices for a startup team of 2 people?,I know that Scrum team is between 3 and 9. But it's quite often that the initial bootstrap project team is of two developers. What specific set of practices would you recommend for them to follow in order to be focused and efficient?  Should they plan Sprints at all? Should they conduct daily standups etc... 
30,"For a IT project that requires vendor involvement, would you manage the Procurement process separately from the actual System Implementation?","For in-house development projects, it is straight forward.   For a IT project that requires vendor involvement, would you :  1) manage the Procurement process separately from the actual System Implementation in 2 IPEC cycles?  Or  2) would you combine the 2 processes and manage them as only 1 PM cycle?   Which would be a better option ?  If #1, how can the 2 project cycles be managed effectively as a full project implementation from the organizatio persepective?   Any advice is appreciated.  Thank you. "
31,What role is there for a PM on an Agile project?,"Back before agile was everywhere, having a PM on all but the smaller projects was considered essential. Now, only the largest projects have people assigned to just in a PM capacity.  I guess I have two parts to this question -  What kinds of projects still require Project Managers? What can projects managers do to add value in an agile world? "
32,Is PMP certification an appropriate career goal for someone about to start a career in project management?,Is PMP certification a requirement for a successful career in Project Management? At which point would it be appropriate for a newly starting project manager to plan to include PMP certification? 
33,What does the Risk field mean in a User Story?,"My team is using VSTS with the Agile process. When creating a User Story, there is a Risk field with options High, Medium and Low. We've searched through both the Agile and Scrum processes VSTS documentation to get an explanation as to what risk this represent, but found nothing.  We tried to reach consensus as to what ""risk"" the field is referring to but ended up undecided between these three definitions:   Risk (as in chance) of the actual outcome (the resulting feature/implementation) not being the desired outcome (in the sense of the actual outcome not being approved by stakeholders) Risk (as in chance) of impediments/issues appearing that blocks development (such as having to research and buy a new tool/framework (such as a zip-code database) in order to implement the user story) Risk (as in ""severity of the consequence"") of getting the implementation wrong (such as having a bug in a operation that may involve a lot of money)   What does the field mean? Does this affect in any way other metrics in VSTS (such as Stack Rank)? "
34,Software to track projects measured in hours and minutes,"I am trying to remember my Project Management class from college many years ago.  I have been part of several IT projects where multiple entities are involved.  For these projects (or cutovers or planned downtimes) I will create a checklist using Google spreadsheet or Excel.  The activities in the checklist typically start in the very early morning hours (typically 1:00am, depending on the customers time zone).  I have been re-familiarizing myself with MS Project and it's alternatives (ProjectLibre, etc).  I am copying the information from my checklist into MS Project but I'm trouble specifying days and times that are outside the regular business day.  Is there a work around?  Is MS Project the correct tools, or should I stick with spreadsheets?  Am I using a hammer when I should be using a screwdriver?  Thanks! "
35,Difference between Incremental and Iterative development (Not Agile),"I know there are millions of articles on this topic and they all talk about:   Iterative (Iterative Waterfall) Dev - delivers an improving product at the end of each iteration  Incremental Dev - delivers a section of the final product at the end of each increment (a core feature of value)  I (think I) can understand Incremental. What I don't get is, what is actually delivered at the end of an Iteration of an Iterative development? Is it a basic version of the full product?  Let's talk about development of a car as an example:  Incremental Dev would split the car into core sections, like so:   First increment: A car that moves by pushing (bad example I know)  Second increment: adds engine to the car Third: adds brakes.... And so on...   Iterative Dev   Would iterative development try to make a version of the full car in one iteration (albeit with very basic features?) So the car would have brakes, engine etc after the first iteration. But they might be buggy etc?  "
36,Do you know any companies that rotate developers between different projects on regular basis?,"I work for a smallish outsourcing company of about 30 people, nearly all of them developers. At any given moment we have 6-9 projects in development for various clients. Most of the projects are developed by 3 programmers and one tester and last around 6 months, but we have also some long-running projects lasting up to two years. We have been practicing Agile methodologies for a couple of years, and now we use Kanban more and more. Most of our developers are highly-skilled and while we have only a couple of ""real TDD"" practitioners, everybody does at least ""test-after"". We don't pair a lot, but instead rely on hallway testing and code reviews.  The problem we have encountered is that after having been acquired by a corporation, which has in the past outsourced all of it's programming work to India, we now handle multiple projects with very significant technical debt, almost all of which will probably run for quite a long time. This is a problem, because morale of the people working on those projects is very low (some people already quit), and the programmers are getting burned out quickly. It has been said that it feels like a prison sentence to be a part of those teams, especially with no end in sight for those projects.  We are looking for a way of increasing morale of the unlucky employees who have to handle the worst projects. One of our ideas is to start rotating people regularly between projects, so that even if someone ends up in a really nasty project, they know that they only have to endure this for a couple of months, and not as long as they work for our company.  We have looked into this idea before, because we think it might be a good way to improve knowledge transfer, shared code ownership and encourage pair programming, but now we have a much stronger incentive to pursue this.  I know of two companies that practice rotating people among projects: Relevance and Pivotal Labs. Relevance has posted an entry on their blog about rotating people, and Pivotal hints about it in some job offers and it was mentioned on Quora.  Do you know any other companies that apply this technique (I'm especially interested in any experience reports)? Is it a good or a bad idea in our situation?    EDIT:  After reading the responses, I have come to the realization, that I might have over-stressed the burnout/prison-projects angle a little bit.  In fact, as I have mentioned above, we have had the idea of rotating people regularly before, and the reason for that is that we expect this to:   Promote knowledge-sharing, because people who are experts in various fields (DB, JavaScript), will have chance to work with a larger subset of other employees. Improve code quality through continuous code review: when a new person enters a project, it will be a fresh set of eyes looking at the code and pointing out the faults in the design/code itself. Foster collective code ownership: if people are expected to rotate off the project, the code, which they wrote will be maintained by other people. In order to not be left with maintaining a completely unknown, ""untouchable"" piece of code written by someone else, the developers will have to share the responsibility for various parts of the system. Foster pair-programming: I believe that pair-programming is a good way of developing software. In a team, which periodically welcomes new members, pair-programming is the most effective way of introducing new people. If programmers spend a lot of time pair-programming with new people, hopefully they will be more likely to pair program with other team members on normal tasks.   I am really interested in learning about other companies that have tried rotating people across projects. Has anyone worked in an environment like that or has heard about some company practicing this? "
37,PRINCE2 certification vs. CSM certification,"I'm already PMI certified PMP, and would like to appear for the CSM training. Can you suggest whether I should go for PRINCE2 certification or CSM certification?  I know about the value and need of both certification, but when we look at the industry where do we see a huge demand for which certification? "
38,iPad for Scrum to Skype or Google Hangout,"I am thinking of using iPad as a Scrum tool to Skype/Google Hangout to coordinate better with our offshore team in a different country.   I am planning to hang the iPad onto the scrum board 'top-center' with clips and other tools. Then, since the iPad's mic or Speaker might not well suited for a place like scrum board, I am thinking of pepping it up with an External Mic and External Speaker, so we are able to be hear and be audible both ways.  I have been using the laptop, (tried standing by the corner of the board and exactly in front of the board, holding the laptop on my palm) but there were issues like (1) Our NYC team could not not hear the offshore team, (2) The offshore team could not hear us, (3) They could not see the scrum board properly (not a major thing I suppose).  So here comes the actual question: Has anyone done this before? How effective it is compared to using a laptop. I would like to know this really, before investing on an iPad!  The iPad idea still might not fix point 3, but I hope it can allow seeing everyone from the board's angle, and could probably hear better since the person who is scrumming will be close to the board and hence the iPad (than me standing in front of the board in an obtrusive way)  Lastly, if any one has used this method, which External Mic and External speakers are recommended?   I have been horribly struggling to connect the offshore and onshore teams as a Scrum master and a Project Manager, and hopefully this will cut down the multitude of email exchanges that sometimes go nowhere. Please let me know your suggestions. Thanks! "
39,PMP certification 35 contact hours- neccessary to be from training institute?,"In the eligibility of the PMP certification it mentions ""35 contact hours"", I have searched on this for my local region and it seems to be that some training centers listed on the PMP site would provide with a certificate certifying these hours.  Is it really necessary to join a training center and get this certificate?  Can't I just study the books myself and appear for the exam?  I know I have already added couple of questions above, but would be great if someone can take one more.  They also state - ""4 years into managing projects and 4500hours of leading teams.""  4500/24 is 188 days - is that right calculation to go by? Also if someone is just leading teams chances are they are not yet managers (atleast by designation) and thus how would this 4years of managing projects be accomplished? "
40,Webvantage vs. Redmine,"If you have familiarity with both Webvantage and Redmine, where do they overlap?  Where do they compliment each other?  Which do you prefer overall, and which features do you prefer of either?  Do you have a workflow that uses them both? "
41,What format do you use to store your stakeholder register?,"I'm trying to update our project management templates and tools for 2012 and looking at all the available online resources and tools. Most are obvious matches (project charters use a word processor, budgets need a spreadsheet, etc.) but I can't decide what is the best way solution for the stakeholder register.  What do you find the most easy to use and easy to maintain? Word? Excel? Custom web-form? "
42,Is it wrong to collect user's IP addresses for registration purposes?,"I develop software and release it under a simple license that allows people a free copy as long as it remains for personal use only. I was thinking of setting up a registration server where the software would connect, obtain a license and then proceed on. By having the user do this, I could log the IP address of the registrant and based on the amount of registrations I receive from a particular IP address, I could gauge if they were using it for personal or commercial use. I know logging IP addresses can be controversial as some people believe it's as good as a real name or home address on the Internet, or get scared if you say you have their IP address, but frankly the moment the connect to my website, Apache logs their IP address in the main log. Would logging the IP addresses of users for registration purposes contradict most privacy policies? Would this method be non-appealing to users?   If there is an alternative method for enforcing non-commercial use of a product without making legal threats or other unpleasant statements, I'd love to hear about it. This idea just came off the top of my head. "
43,"Ongoing Development and Maintenance: Should I break it up into small projects, or keep one open project and keep adding milestones?","I have to manage ongoing development and maintenance of a client's web domain. There are many ideas for features to add in the future.  I was wondering what the best practice would be for an ongoing project. Should I keep one project open, and keep adding tasks and milestones for each stage of advancement?  or, should I just create new projects for each stage of development?  I'm wondering if a project will get too cumbersome if I'm continually adding more to it, and if it would be better to have smaller projects which I can close after completion. But, that leaves me thinking about maintenance on those closed projects.  PS: I'm using zoho projects if that makes any difference. "
44,Jira - How to name a Jira release,"We have a Jira project which contains all issues for a single website.  The website has several different components, such as the theme and several lambda functions.  Each component has their own repository and is deployed separately from the others.  Confusion sets in when trying to figure out how to name each Jira release/version.  We will be using semantic versioning, however, do we create a different version for each component?  For example, should a history of releases for a project look like:   Theme-Release-2.3.0 LabmdaFuncA-Release-1.9.0 LambdaFuncB-Hotfix-1.6.1 Theme-Release-2.4.0 LambdaFuncB-Release-1.7.0   Or should all of the components share the same release version?   Release-1.4.0     (contains updates for Lambda Function A) Release-1.5.0     (contains updates for Lambda Function B) Release-1.6.0     (contains updates for the Theme)   Also, a related question: Should the repository version match the Jira version?

45,Can 'relationship building' be a cop out?,"Everyone is always telling me that to be successful as a project manager you have to build good relationships with your project teams. I see it all over this forum and am told this by other PMs in my company. My problem is, I don't believe this is a real solution to many problems and I'm currently thinking this is just a BS default answer given when the real answer is ""I don't know"" or ""I can't do anything about it"".   Real world example - We have, from my perspective, a corporate culture issue where line managers are VERY protective of their teams and extremely hesitant to provide help with things outside the scope of their team's immediate job at a given moment. E-mailed requests go unanswered. In-person conversations often end with ""I'll get you that by the end of the day"" and the next day I'm in another conversation with the same person - ""We were really busy. I'll get it to you tomorrow."" and this can continue for months with escalations to their management giving me the exact same response (""They're busy. Tomorrow."" and then tomorrow comes and goes with no result). As a PM, a lot of my job is getting these various teams to work together and it's just hell because they don't want to.  I ask my fellow PMs how to handle this and the answer I get is ""You have to build a good relationship with them. They have to WANT to do things for you."" Huh? That seems like BS to me. Aren't they getting paid to do stuff for the company? I'm just some dude that coordinates things. I'm not even really the one initiating the requests. Someone else asked me to get this information for them and they're going to hold me accountable for getting them that information. If they really are that busy, their line managers need to handle that. I'm running the project, not the individual teams and when you tell me ""Person X is your guy"" and then person X says they don't have time to do what I need, that's not a problem I can solve because I'm not their manager. However, I just keep getting told to build a better relationship with the teams. Honestly, I'm not even sure what that means I should do. It's not like I get invited out to lunch with these teams or hang out chatting in the halls. I don't even work on the same floor as most of them. Am I supposed to just randomly stop by all of their desks and try to strike up interesting conversations? I would hate if some PM stopped by to chit-chat with me while I was trying to work.  So is this a cop out? When is it ok to say ""relationship building is not the problem here"" and how do you get that across? "
46,"When is overtime an appropriate use of resources, and how do I account for it?","Under which conditions is it acceptable to push my team to do overtime work? Once I have pushed my team to do overtime work, how do I factor the added risks and costs associated with the push into my project plan? "
47,Good (possibly free) tools for running Monte Carlo Simulations?,"We need to perform a good deal of Monte Carlo analysis on some of our project plans - basically creating tornado diagrams, sensitivity analysis and follow it up with Monte Carlos. I am aware of commercial tools like @Risk by Palisade, Risk Simulator, Crystal Ball etc.,   Is there anything which is free and good? (i.e., can consider a large number of distributions and also help perform the aforementioned analyses). What has been your experience with them? "
48,How do I end crashed sprints and remain responsive to the customer?,"We have been using Scrum methodology and have been mostly successful, but there are few weeks where the sprints are totally crashed by customer demands or defects.   Is there a better way of handling the product road-map and to respond to the customer? Would you suggest splitting the group to deal the issues separately, or do you suggest splitting all the developers' time to give them a buffer (perhaps 20%)?  Goals: To end crashed sprints and remain as responsive as possible to the customer.  "
49,How technical should a Project Manager be?,"Consider a software project involving a bunch of developers of mixed experience.  The PM has the delivery responsibility for the project, but undertakes this through the team members.   When the developers give an estimate for a technical task, how important it is for the PM to know what is being told to decide if is reasonable?  When the developers specify a technical impediment, how much involved should the PM be to resolve it?  Hope you get the drift of the question.  Obviously there is no right or wrong answer, just thoughts.  "
50,What are the current tools available for PM?,"What are the current up to date project management tools to use? I have been using dotProject which I know is outdated, what ones are out there and the best for small to medium projects?  To be more specific: A tool for tracking things like time, costs, progress and gantt charts etc. "

53,What percentage of a project manager's time should be spent working in the project management software and documentation?,"What percentage of the project manager's time is spent planning, writing tasks, and tracking time in the project management software?  How much time should be given to documentation?    Every position is a little different, so I'm hoping to see some different answers based on different experiences.    In your answer, please list the following items:   Type of project How many people were on the project and their roles. How long it lasted How much time (percentages are fine) you spent working on the above items. If you're a technical project manager, please list that as well.  I'm wondering if technical project managers spend less time planning than non-technical project managers and what impact that has on planning, organizing, and assessing the project risk, success, and other factors.   Scope reduction UPDATE:  On smaller projects consisting of roughly 5 to 10 developers, how much of the developer's time should be spent planning, writing tasks, and tracking time in the project management software?  How much time should be given to documentation?    As per the requests below, I've narrowed the scope to just smaller projects.     UPDATE on 2/26/2011: This question is still open.  I'm looking for links to professional resources that describe the suggested breakdown of time management for a project manager in a small project.  Personal experiences are helpful, but it would also help me to see the information backed up with at least one good link. "
54,Are Gantt diagrams compatible with Agile methods?,"If they are, is it simple to use them with theses methods? Have you some use cases to present? "
55,Reduce amount of required hotfixes without technical knowledge,"I'm a software developer who suffers from the regular hotfixes that are required to an application I've developed.  The application I've developed didn't had many infrastructure requirements from the start but over time those requirements became more and more. This is only one part of the problem because when such an new requirement comes it is expected for me to make a hotfix outside of other planed work. Because the project managers already promised a working application.   I want to reduce the amount of hotfixes I have to make, as this would let me concentrate on the task I'm currently working on and the project managers won't have to apologize when the product isn't working from the start.  Most of those infrastructure requirements have to do with authentication and authorization (active directory, support cross domain, impersonation, etc.).  I think neither the product owner nor the project managers nor I know enough about the technical specifics to build a requirement catalog from the start.  The product is developed with Scrum as the project management ideology. (I'm also part of other Scrum Teams.)  How can a small business without this knowledge prevent such hotfixes?  I know that not promising a working solution and having reserved time for tests and corrections would solve this. But is there another way this could be prevented? Or should I try to have a talk to the project managers and try to change their way? "
56,Quickly explain how to make estimation work to an external business stakeholder,"Scenario: need to quickly explain how the estimation will work to an external business stakeholder; can't take more than few minutes really. The project area is web development.  P.S. There's no point in mentioning Agile, SCRUM and other terms that the business stakeholder doesn't really care about. All she cares about is producing ""good"" (or ""decent"") estimates so that she can, on her part, reasonably calculate project/feature cost and delivery time.  Here goes my outline:     Components for estimation      A component that should be estimated shouldn't be a feature, but should a deliverable: examples: ""checkout   process"", ""user registration""         components can then be split into sub-components (for estimation's sake)   e.g. SCRUM splits these into ""epics"" and ""user stories""         Any deliverable should have clear ""cut off"" points that determine   whether it's actually delivered.      When a feature is ""delivered"" it implies it is actually deployed (not   simply sitting somewhere in some code repository) and delivers actual   user benefit      Estimates themselves      When thinking ""what to estimate"" thinking about the following should   help:         component development effort (e.g. if you foresee there's a lot of manual work, or reading a lot of documentation, these increase   ""effort"") - this is a ""predictable"" part   component development complexity (e.g. if you know that developing this part is very tricky, comprising a number of edge   cases, it will need a lot of testing, and therefore automated tests to   be developed) - this is a ""predictable"" part   component development uncertainty (maybe there's a better term) - this is the ""unpredictable"" part - if it is clear this part is inflating the estimate more than the ""predictable"" parts, then a   ""spike"" should be conducted to make producing the deliverable more   predictable, leading to a better estimate         what makes a given task unpredictable? Examples include: using an API you've never used/seen used by others before; a task requires a   technical accomplishment which you haven't actually seen being   accomplished by anyone so far, i.e. don't know whether it's possible,   etc      Any ""deliverable"" or sub-component thereof can be estimated at 1, 2, 3, 5, 8 where 2 is the ""double"" of 1 (obvious, but important to   point out) any component that appears to be larger than 8 should be   further split - this makes estimates less likely to be inaccurate      Any points I missed? "
57,What is an appropriate quality standard for requirements specifications?,"In my role as a Business Analyst working for a offshore company (7 developers, 4 QA, 1 PM, 1 Architect) but being onsite, I go through the Business Requirement Document's, Epics and Stories briefed by Product Owners (PO) and write a more detailed specification for an offshore team. Its a 2 week sprint, and the stories, designs often come not more than 2-3 days before the sprint planning day. Not to mention about that the designs are handled by a separate team in itself, and sometimes there is a disconnect between PO and Design as well. Furthermore there are clients who have their own Product Owners and Designers doing last minute requests, changes, priorities to customize or white-label it for them.   To add more complexity, I am NOT involved in the PO-Design or PO-Client discussions. With this stated I try best to read the documents on wiki, see whatever designs that are available currently, while Design is trying to polish and fine tune them (these are mostly outdated initial bare minimum designs), read Business Requirement Documents-BRD (which are often at a high-level and mostly not updated as what is on the Design currently)   So with these limitations, I take up the stories (about 8-10) that are slated for the offshore team specifically    Review stories that they are work ready (documented responsibility said by Client - seems pretty broad and covers most of the work below),   Define edge cases Provide more detailed information on every line of Acceptance Criteria (AC) Add necessary resources to the story/feature description (any content like XML that needs to be used, any Wiki that needs to be pointed for more information or Design assets that are missing) Co-ordinate with Design, PO, PM, Scrum Master to get everything seamless Facilitate conference calls to run through all the stories (Story Time) every Sprint Thursday explain them as much as possible Answer their queries/ clarifications that come in everyday (these are sometimes too obvious and unclear questions - takes my whole day often) Demo for stories completed by Offshore team (preparing the Wiki page, information, test data) Do Acceptance Tests for offshore teams stories, prepare a document and pass it over to the actual POs Daily review of Rally discussion board and answering them, reaching out to the necessary Tech leads and developers onsite to get information on this Review test cases and sign-off   With all these things done, when any small issue creeps in stopping the story completion per the definition of done. The offshore team completely point fingers at me.   What is an appropriate quality standard for a requirements specification?  How can we design a process to more flexibly adapt to changes in requirements? "
58,Project Management Tools for Embedded Software Professionals,"I understand this may apply to very few but I hope there are some who can give me good advice.  I would like to know what project management tools embedded software engineering organizations/groups/teams have been using - and why? Embedded Software development imposes it's own requirements for projects and their management so keeping those in mind, if you had a chance to work towards selecting your tool, what were your criteria? Also, if you are already using one, what are the features they lack specifically due to your requirements or preferences? "
59,Use cases for read-only screen,"I'm looking into use cases and user stories topics, and I have difficulties to properly define those for a project.  Although it's quick and straightforward on user goals such as 'perform this', 'perform that' etc... I have a screen where the user does not have any transactional activity, but instead reporting or read-only screens.  Let's take an example: I have a dashboard with numbers to get the amount of rent achieved this months, etc.  What would be a great use case for this? At first, I was asking 'why would the user need to access this screen?', in order to understand where it fits to adjust the strategy. So a possible use case could be: Assess rental achievable.  Last, in this screen, a user can filter data, like seeing its amount for a particular country state. Is this part of a use case? Or part of the previous use case? If the latter option, what would it be? "
60,Is a Project Coordinator a Step closer to becoming a Project Manager?,"So I understand that the Project Coordinator's main duties are to schedules the project, manages contracts and vendors, manages the resources (especially in construction projects), creates most project related documents, coordinates meetings, etc...   So it looks to me that a Project Coordinator is one small step from becoming a Project Manager? am I correct, or can a Project Coordinator be at least considered for a Project Management role?  I would also like to know how respected Project Coordinators are compared to Project Managers, are they on the same level? (I'm referring the level in the Management Hierarchy). "

62,How to run our first post mortem?,"I'd like to do a post mortem (""lessons learned"") analysis of a recent feature development. It would be the first formal post mortem we do. It was a comparedly small project (roughly 3 weeks), but surfaced enough problems worth analyzing.   A bit of background: I'm probably the typical lead developer becoming responsible for project management. Involved are 3 of the 7 software developers (me as manager, the product manager of the feature in question, and the developer implementing it).   I'm looking for general suggestions, but here are some questions I'm unsure about:   Should other developers / roles be involved, or just us three ""affected""? How much ""preparation"" should be expected, and what kind? (I'd probably list the ""flow of events"" and problems I see to give a starting point. Should I ask the other gys to prepare that as well, or would that put to much pressure on the meeting itself?) Time allocated? I'd expect an hour. What outcome would one expect - e.g. a half page ""was good / was bad / ideas for improvement""?  "
63,Where are opesource requirements analysis and design documentation,"It's very easy to get the code of an opensource project, but it's different for the higher level artifacts.  Is it because it's called open source, is it because I can't find it, or what? Is there a place where I can get some good projects to study? "
64,Managing multiple development projects in Scrum,"My organization is currently using Scrum to manage a large development project. Once this is complete we will start to work on several smaller projects (ranging from approx 2 weeks to 2 months work) either simultaneously or by taking each one in turn.  My question is, what is the best way to manage multiple smaller projects in a Scrum environment? Should we work on a single project at a time or could we effectively work on stories from more than one project in a single sprint? The other option I can see is a hybrid of this, where we work on Project A in one sprint and Project B in the next.  Personally, I would like to concentrate on a single project at a time but I am aware that internal business pressures may make this a difficult sell. Any suggestions would be much appreciated. "
65,Will a Project Manager for a project which requires development of significant amounts of new code expected to have software development experience?,"Is software development experience strictly necessary when managing a project which requires the development of significant amounts of new code?

66,"When does one call themselves a ""Consultant""?","I currently do a number of things at work, but I have no idea what to officially call myself?, I was a IT/Telco Design Engineer previously and now I do more Program Coordination/Governance, Resource Management and Project Management work as part of the PMO team, but I still do volunteer on some occasions to help out in some software dev or Solutions Architecture work, but my main focus now is really towards PM.  I have been searching around and asking questions to Seniors at work but everyone seems to have a different definition of ""Consultant"", there was even a small argument between two colleagues about its meaning when I asked and whether it applies to what I currently do, or if PM's are able to call themselves Consultants..  On my Job Application it officially states that I'm a Consultant , but I'm not sure if this is what I truely am? which confuses me to what I should state on my LinkedIn page without removing the fact that I'm part of the PMO team?, I mean from what I have gathered now, a Consultant is an employee who works closely with a client to solve their current business and Telco/IT issues, but on this following page on wikipedia it states something a bit different: Consulting Levels  So what is a Consultant?, what does a Consultant do?, can I call myself a Consultant even while being part of the PMO team?, as I would've called myself a Junior PM, but I'm doing so much other things.  Its like when I was a IT/Telco Design Engineer, I would do Programming, Testing, Solution Architecture, Support, BA...etc, it was all consolidated within ""Design Engineer"", so is that what a Consultant is too? "
67,What is the standard for evaluating team maturity?,"There are ever so many references to the team's 'maturity' in the Agile/Lean related books and articles/blogs.  Using my common sense I think I can get the idea. I can see how my team has evolved over the last year and how is still evolving. But still, I know for sure that we lack maturity.  We are a self-organizing team without anyone experienced enough to guide us through the difficult time of changes. We are finding our way (with myself - the most recent enthusiast of kanban and lean methodology) and we will get there.    We are in our early days working aside the kanban board, getting there to automate a number of processes. Learning. We are getting agile bit by bit. We are growing and I can feel it.  But is there any way to measure where we are? Is there any benchmark? And what are the next steps? "
68,"How long until a team can ""become"" agile on the job?","Last year I led a project for a research institute. Requirements had been in progress over the entire project, and I had lot of trouble when planning, budgeting and providing other estimates.  Now, in 2011, the customer is asking for a fixed price offering to evolve the delivered system. Again, requirements are so undefined that in the first phase I'm planning a two months or so analysis task to just DEFINE requirements.  After some thought, I'm almost convinced that an agile approach would be the answer to satisfy such a customer (and not to have yet another painful year ;)). My questions are:    Do you agree that an Agile approach would help?  With neither the team, nor the PM, having experience with Agile processes, is it to risky to try to switch at this point?  Assuming we will be self training, how long would it take us to successfully switch to a more Agile approach?   I understand these are not easy questions to answer. Thanks "
69,"What can I do to prepare for managing a project which is staffed mostly with volunteers, for a non-for-profit organization?","When about to take on a project which is mostly staffed by volunteers, for a non-for-profit organization, what kinds of challenges should I prepare for, which I am unlikely to have seen elsewhere?

70,"When a new standard is about to be released for a PM certification, should I take the current version or wait for the next?","From a project management perspective, Which is more advisable?   To go for a certification right away (currently, the PMP with PMBOK n-1) To Wait for the rollout of the next standard (like PMBOK n [when the version n is due in a few months])   From the certification point of view, does it make any difference?  Upgrading our skills even after certification is definitely a must-have. "
71,Do technical leaders compete with project managers?,"Technical leaders in our projects are competing with project managers.  Or in more general aspect, is it a problem if someone with greater domain specific knowledge tends to dominate in project or become an informal PM?  If a person with technical knowledge, tries to become the informal PM and fight with (sometimes feckless) project manager, how would you resolve this situation? "
72,Team needs a lot of time to deliver even the simplest stories- how to know why?,"So, the problem, from the management perspective is that a Scrum Team delivers only the simplest stories within the whole Sprint. Literally, changing a button takes two weeks. The Team estimates within a stable velocity, and mostly delivers everything that they commit to successfully.   I (a Scrum Master) have many suspicions why that is so, however I'd like to hear these problems directly from the Development Team. Do you have any tips on how to tackle this problem? What retrospective activities should I prepare for the Team?  To clarify: I'm more than sure that the problem lies within the development process rather than an overall unwillingness to work.  "
73,Do we really need project managers?,"My friend from UK - Richard Newton - has published a very interesting article which tries to answer this question. However, I don't think he managed to look at all the angles and give appropriate answers.  Therefore, I would like to ask you: Do we really need project managers?  I'm looking forward to some interesting perspectives.  PS: The article I mentioned can be found here: Why Do We Need Project Managers?, in case anybody is interested in reading it. "
74,How do you report project status?,"What is the typical project reporting model are you using in your project team? When I say reporting, I am talking about both reporting externally to stakeholders and internally to all team members.   Do you use an 'active reporting' mechanism like everyone sending out status emails, or project manager going around asking for updates, or a daily status update call - or you use a passive reporting mechanism, like the project management system itself generates reports in an automated way based on normal project tasks updates entered by team members? How much of your reporting is individualistic and how much is tool dependent? Is it daily or weekly?  I would like to know what has worked best in your situation (please mention your context - like a co-located team or geographically distributed). There is obviously no one-size-fits-all answer.  Many thanks! "
75,Changing Processes - is it better to do it gradually or just change?,"Based off of my previous question Can Scrum be suited to smaller development teams?, we have now picked out the elements of Scrum that would best fit our team and business, however, my Boss has suggested that we implement the processes gradually.  I'm unsure about this myself as I fear that we would not make the transition to the Scrum method that we have tailored completely and we would still be in a jumbled mess we're in now.  If we were to do it gradually, what would be the best way to go about it (not necessarily Scrum, but the recommended way, if any, to make the transition to a different methodology)? "
76,Why is the middle ground between functional and matrix organizations so common?,"I'm a software developer, and most companies I've worked for are organized in a system that is a middle ground between functional and matrix. Much more functional than matrix, indeed.  The structure is something like this: there are several teams in the company, each one being responsible for a specific function. But one of these teams has a special characteristic. It is also responsible for a product and works in a project-oriented manner. Let's call it the ""product team"". All projects that this team carries out are intended to maintain or improve their product. As such, the product team is the project ""driver"", so to speak, requesting services from the other teams as needed. In general, the product team is responsible for programming functions, and requests services from Data Analysis, DBA, User Interface, Test, Deployment and so on.  Honestly, from my personal experience, I have only seen problems with this approach. To list some:   Individuals in the ""service teams"" lack long-term commitment to the product or the project. Their mindset is to finish the service as quickly as possible and, once delivered, it becomes somone else's problem. Obviously, this is not their fault. They are only reacting to incentives, because if they do otherwise, they will probably be punished (or, at least, not be rewarded). For the same reason as pointed out in the previous item, the service team members lack contextual information that would help them to see the big picture. They may be able to perform their services well, but they are not able to suggest alternatives or challenge wrong assumptions. Hence, the overall performance is sub-optimal. Since the activities are inherently coupled to each other (the separation into functional teams is somewhat arbitrary and artificial), some problems are faced over and over by different teams, as the project evolves. Each team will have to learn the business rules from scratch, for example, and will probably have the same basic questions, which will demand the same basic answers. All teams will go through the same learning curve. From a management perspective, coordinating the schedules of all those teams is a very hard problem. It is very common to have to wait some weeks to get a job done because the members of some service team are all busy fulfilling requests from other teams. Depending on how the teams are partitioned, sometimes different teams have conflicting goals. For example, a good project team will have a high throughput (let's say, number of software features per month), which necessarily leads to changes in the production environment. The deployment team normally has the opposite goal: to maintain the production environment as stable as possible. So, they will create all kinds of obstacles to the deployment of those features.  A certain ""tribal"" behavior emerges from this setup. Probably this is just human nature, but when people are separated into different groups with conflicting goals, they will start to see each other as rivals and not as co-workers. [edit to include another problem I remembered] Due to the arbitrary nature of this kind of partition, some problems that are experienced by one team can only be solved by another team, either for technical or political reasons. But such problems may be evaluated differently by each team. For the one that has the problem, it may be top priority. From the ""solver"" point of view, however, it may be less important. As a consequence, it will never be solved at all, or it will generate an enormous level of political conflict between the involved functional areas.   Despite all the drawbacks listed above, this kind of team organization seems to be overwhelmingly common. Why is this? Is there some big, obvious advantage that I'm missing, that surpasses all the problems I pointed out? "
77,Minimum Project Management Practices for One-Man Software Projects,"I've worked a lot on projects by myself -- ""one man"" projects. These are typically small projects in the software domain. Many of them have no customers other than myself (who actually use the end product); some have other users.  The question that keeps recurring to me is what kind of project management practices should I apply, at a minimum, in these projects? Having no other developers or staff, things can move and change quickly.  At a minimum, I always have:   A vision of what I'm going to accomplish A scope statement describing much of the work A risk register with my top 5-10 risks to monitor A place to list procurement items (graphics/sound)   Without getting too cumbersome, what are the other aspects that I should include in my projects?  Edit: On the technical side, I usually use a variant of agile/Scrum -- a product backlog and estimates per story in points, with no sprints, just releases. "
78,How to resolve leadership conflicts in project?,How to resolve conflicts in project when:   No roles are clearly defined (eg. no project charter). Project manager is sluggish / incompetent. Technical people feel like more competent than PM.   Bit of explanation:   This results in personal conflicts - who is in charge of technical aspects? Who is contacting with client?  Nothing is done on time. Resources can't be provided. Project manager is only focused on delivering features but not on quality. Project members feel like being on slowly sinking ship. They aware of obstacles / problems but project manager apparently is not.    I'm looking forward for not-so-obvious answers (like changing the PM) :)  
79,Machine learning in Requirement change management,"Good day! Looking for an example or a demo which describe complete process of requirement change management using similar  historic change request using any machine learning technique or any data mining technique. The main focus is to reuse previous change experience. To explain further, reffering text from a research paper.  Every time a new Request for a Change (RFC) comes in to the system, it is compared to changes stored in the Change Knowledge Base (CKB). An RFC represents the initial state of a change and the comparison occurs between the RFC at hand and the RFC of a past completed change, for the sake of simplicity, we will use the term change and RFC interchangeably. The CKB consists of the set of all changes performed in the past. The comparison of the RFC at hand with a particular change makes use of a similarity function that will be described in section 4. The most similar changes will be displayed to the user along with a measure (normalized to a value between 0 and 1) of how similar the change is to the RFC. A domain expert will provide feedback on whether or not they believe that the displayed changes are genuinely similar to the actual RFC.  Taken from research paper.[website]Is this approach useful?  If useful in which phase of requirement change management will it be useful?    From where can I get an example of complete process based on actual data ? "

86,What are the signs that a project is going wrong?,"The obvious answer is 'missing key milestones', but that depends on a structured project plan with clear milestones (e.g. waterfall model).  What are some of the not-so-obvious or subtle signs that the project is going awry? What's the best-case or worst-case impact on the project?  Please give one item in your answer so we can gather them together here and people can vote accordingly. You can post more than one answer if you have several to share. Real-world examples would be helpful. "
87,How to define a task completion criteria?,"You, being a project manager, assign a task to a technical specialist. You don't understand exactly what he/she is doing, since you don't have his/her skills and education. How do you define a task completion criteria? In other words, how do you know when the task is really completed? "
88,Comprehensive single requirement docs vs. multiple atomic ones,"First of all, let me make it clear that I am a software developer and that I am writing this ISO help with my desire to agile-ize my project management and get a buy-in for changing some general requirements documentation technique that my team follows.  Please do not confuse it with seeking people management advice, I am aware that is off topic on this forum.  I will try to make it simple and clear.  When I was hired into my contract position a few months ago, I was told the team was following Agile but not all the way and that they were open to making further advancement towards it.  Once started, I realized that the instilled workflow habits and procedures are still very much waterfall and that very comprehensive requirements documents are written sometimes several months before any development begins.  By ""comprehensive"", I mean that, while a requirement does cover a coherent and interrelated functional unit, it is by no means atomic and that it can be further broken down into a hierarchy of individually atomic albeit interdependent units of work.    My hope was that each atomic, meaning not possible to further slice it into smaller chunks, unit of progress should have its own sprint/iteration and its own requirements document.  From the development perspective, a clear advantage of this is that I don't have to grasp a wider requirements document, which leaves more focus on the direct task at hand, resulting in better quality work.  It is like being handed two different tasks for installing a door and painting a room when the two can conveniently be split into two tasks:  you first install the door, then you paint the room.  In our current setup, it is a single requirements document, which makes it difficult to grasp or even find the specifics of the concrete task at hand in a document that encompasses other tasks as well.  I am asking this question to confirm that my idea does conform to the official Agile doctrine and that I am not misunderstanding.  Should Agile requirements always be as minimal as possible or are there benefits to bundling multiple interdependent work tasks together into a comprehensive document?  From the perspective of my cognitive styles and preferences, having the project management side of the team break down the work into individual atomic tasks would enable me to have to do less project management myself and actually focus more attention on coding rather than structuring increments towards the final objective.  Another advantage is that it would be much easier to give LOE and completion estimates on a more narrowly scoped task than a whole project.

89,Should a PM also be a resource on the project? Why?,"we have a small team of highly technical people and one of them is the project manager for the project. The person who is in PM role for this project is experienced and has previous project management experience also. So it felt 'natural' for him to be PM the project.  But, he is also a resource for the project.  Should this be the case? is it 'normal' ?  Clearly, that person staying off the critical path is key, but what are the possible problems/risks that we may not have thought of? "

91,How to work with estimated end dates in MS Project?,"I am new to MS Project and already asked a question here that revealed my incomplete knowledge of the scheduling process. After reading some articles and watching videos like this one, I think of myself as being a few steps closer to get the grasp of the scheduling in MS Project.  However, I am still not sure how to go about the following example: A supplier sends an email confirming my inquiry and includes a date of delivery.  How do I incorporate the delivery date into the schedule, but make the task automatically planned?   I know this is a little unspecific, but I feel like an example would help me a lot.    Edit: The following works, I am not sure if this is OK though.   Setting the task as manually planned (duration stays estimated) Link the start date (duration stays estimated, end date is adjusted) Enter the scheduled end date (duration changes value and from estimated to fixed) Turn the task into automatically planned (duration stays fixed)  "
92,Appropriate use of 'Supporting Experts' as descriptor for people 'familiar with subject matter',"The PMBOK uses the term 'Supporting Experts' in the list of project team roles, defined as     Supporting experts perform activities required to develop or execute the PM plan. ... such as contracting, financial management, logistics, legal, safety, engineering, test, or quality control ... may be assigned to work full time or may just participate on the team when their particular skills are required.   I don't tend to want to get caught up in definitions or wordsmithing, but 'stakeholder' and 'project staff' or even 'user' are just very clear, broadly used terms that help keep a conversation nice and pithy and keep everyone on the same page with the same vocabulary.  But I find I lack a term for someone on the ground floor that gets brought in occasionally for interviews, to bounce questions off of, or clarify some nuance. As in ""John who works in that department and knows the product in and out, but isn't formally on the team, but he is our go-to when making sure we understand something about the customer/product/market.""  'Oracle' works behind closed doors, but I want something I can put into an email. ""Person familiar with the production"" is too hard to say in conversation.  Is 'supporting expert' appropriate for the role/work I've described? Or is there perhaps a better term? "

94,How are user stories and tasks managed in Scrum,"I noticed that Scrum boards have the following columns, the one I am asking about is the 1st column ""Stories"".  Before a Sprint begins, you take stories from the Product Backlog that you will work on and complete during the Sprint.  When exactly do you break the tasks out for each story?  Does everyone break stories out into tasks?  Is this specific to Scrum and not say kanban?   "

97,Who bears the cost of bug fixing in an Agile project?,I'm new to Agile projects.   How do you manage the cost of bug fixing? Does the customer pays for that effort or the software factory? 
98,Best practice for tracking merging hotfixes,"We are working with two main branches in our project, a development branch and a production branch. All production fixes get their own hotfix branch, which is then merged back into the development branch when all tests pass and the customer/client validates the ticket is correct.  As a result, sometimes the merging step doesn't happen until later. The consequence of this is that at times the merging step is forgotten. Right now we track the hotfix ticket in JIRA but nothing really tracks the merging part of the task.  What would be a good way to track the merging step for a hotfix? We could do a sub-task in the original ticket but that would mean that ticket can't be closed till the merging happens. Would a new ticket just to track this merging step be the right way? "
99,How can I know if my app is ready for beta release?,"I have created an Android app which I think works ""good enough"" but I have not a large amount of users and not done much user testing. I did the first alpha release last week. Everything works, can I promote the app to beta or production or is there a series of ""must"" that I should consider?  The app is supposed to do online classified ads against a google appengine back-end. It works to register a new user, login and get a jwt (JSON Web Token), stay logged in, view your profile page (not yet update it), place a new advertisement through the form and submit a picture file with it, and view and search classified ads. I have all this functionality working, so should I promote my app to beta release? Or should I wait until I get a thorough review?  The reason that I am eager is to get more users by promoting the app to beta and/or production so that I can follow my users and know what to improve in the app.  "
100,Going from Scrum to Kanban near “release”,"I am working as Scrum Master on a large software project. We are currently running Scrum. We have about one month left in the development phase before we are supposed to end our implementation phase.  I am strongly considering switching to Kanban (Or GTD) for the last couple of weeks due to:   We have an absolute deadline It is very hard to plan two (or one) week ahead now that we are this close to the end. The agenda, priority and outstanding tasks changes almost each day. We daily find new tasks we must remember to do before we can say our development phase is finished. Kanban let me easier identfiy which tasks are waiting for reponse, which tasks are waiting for verification etc.   Anybody have experiences with this? Is this a good idea?  Our sprints are not entirely pontensial shippable increments (I know they should have been, but thats not what I want to discuss here) "
101,How to keep track of finished tasks vs deployed tasks in JIRA?,"My development team and I have been using release dates (or fixVersions as they are called in JIRA) to keep track of all tickets for our iterative development schedule.   However, as our team grows this is becoming increasingly complicated. Some tickets need to have code deployed to be considered ""done"" whereas others (mockups, plugin changes etc.) do not. When attempting to deploy a fixVersion we only want our deployment specialist to see tickets with deployable code. However, we do not want to lose track of tickets completed from the same sprint that do not have code to be deployed.   Has anyone else struggled to make this organizational distinction in JIRA? What is the best way to approach this? "
102,How to plan projects that are not able to be planned?,"Some projects are not able to be planned, because they depend on innovation not yet available. As an example; the race to the moon. Kennedy said they would bring man to the moon, but at that moment in time, it was not clear what would be needed to do that.   But the US did it, and did it in the timeframe Kennedy was giving. How can you make such estimations, with so much unclear yet? Are there some ways to plan the unplannable? "
103,Cycle Time - Story vs Task?,"I am trying to measure the cycle time of my team. The problem is that the issues (tasks or stories) have very different sizes. Sometimes someone just creates a task like: ""Create a backend api"", that doesn't deliver value for the final customer and is very small. And sometimes the Product Owner creates tasks like ""Implement anti fraud system"" which are very large.  How should we measure the cycle time? One convention that we have been using is to only measure stories' cycle time, not tasks' nor subtasks'.  How should this be done? "
104,"How to structure a ""work package""?","Could someone give me the information about how one structures the s.c. ""work packages""? I have never done this before but that's my task now. I need to describe use-cases, preliminary definitions, example workflows of the application, goals, I/O of the application, requirements etc. Does someone have a sample document with ""work packages"" or a link to some corresponding resource in the Web?  This is for a software development project. "
105,Professional Scrum Master vs Certified ScrumMaster® (CSM),What is the different between the following project management certifications Professional Scrum Master (PSM) Certified ScrumMaster® (CSM)? Which one is better? 
106,Should all team members be expected to do the same amount of overtime?,"A Senior Manager (SM) has 3 Leads in his team. Person A commits to any work given at any time and is so dedicated that he does overtime as necessary get the work done. Person B &amp; Person C do their work well but are very systematic and procedural. Hence, B &amp; C accept work based on their load and deliver as agreed.  Now the SM expects B &amp; C to work the same as A. Is this expectation correct? If so,  who has to change? A, or B and C? "
107,"Kanban, moving items back? Or how do you manage mistakes?","Given that you have a feature tracking through your Kanban board, the dev marks it done, it's pulled into QA, and the dev pulls in new work.  QA fails the item.  Now what? You can't move it back into the dev stream as it's full. You can't move it forward into Deployment as it's not working properly.  Where does it go? Or does it go all the way to the left to approved tasks with a high priority, for analysis to pull in and add any details to it, and then for devs to pull in from there? Assuming your flow looked something like:  Backlog -> Start -> Analysis -> Dev -> QA -> Deployment -> Done "
108,Developer - QA - customer - production branching workflow,"How should one use branches to be able to test:   on local environment (during development), on a branch for testing with real environment (QA-testing), testing by customers on pre-production branch, and finally merging to production?   We have the following branches: prod (customer production branch), dev(pre-production branch), staging(for QA), and local developers' branches.  For our current workflow, we have:   For development and local testing, done in developers' branches. After code review, merge those local developers' branches to QA's branch. After QA tested, merge changes to pre-production customer branch (customer will test) Customer merges to production branch.   Problems appear on the second step. For example, we have some major tasks and some tasks that can wait. And developers already have done some major tasks and those tasks are already on step 2, but suddenly customers decide that some of the ""can wait"" tasks need to be done now and those changes should be merged right in pre-production branch so QA and customers could test it right away. Now customer liked all changes and he merges changes to production.  After all this we have:   prod and pre-production are the same. staging branch is behind  developers always start new tasks from the production branch a developer tested his task and wants to merge to staging (QA's branch) also some other developers finish some ""can wait"" tasks and QA is already testing them, so they are in staging branch But because branches are different he might have conflicts with other developers' work. But his work is a major task. Now he needs to fix conflicts. That means to update some changes from staging in his branch and merge to staging for testing. It results in a branch which started from production and has some chunks of code from staging (that have probably not been tested yet).   What we should do in such cases? What should a normal workflow look like? "
109,"To what framework do ""User Stories"" belong?","In my University of Applied Science we got taught that user stories are a part of Scrum, and when reading things on the internet it seems that everyone indeed uses User Stories when using Scrum. The accepted answer at this question for even speaks of ""Scrum User Stories"", and the accepted answer of this question also mentions user stories are part of Scrum. Also, everyone I speak to at my internship company thinks User Stories are part of Scrum.  However, I can't find any mention of User Stories in the Scrum Guide. Only of ""backlog items"" which could be anything. Even ""Design a logo"" could be a backlog item, if I understand the Guide correctly, but that's absolutely not a User Story.  To what framework do User Stories belong, if they don't belong to Scrum? And what caused them to be regarded as a core part of Scrum? "
110,Do multiple levels of epics make sense?,"Is it a sensible approach to have multiple levels of epics to structure the requirements of an Agile project?  For example:   Epic ""As a User I want to browse information on a website""  Epic ""... I want to browse topic A""  User-Story ""... I want to see Diagrams on topic A""  Epic ""... I want to browse topic B""  User-Story ""... I want to see Photos on topic B""     Or is it better to have a 'flat' requirements hierarchy? i.e. only 2 levels of hierarchy, epic -> user story. "
111,Splitting profit into members,"My colleagues (2 friends of mine (Financial &amp; International Management students) and I (Full stack JEE Developer)  developed a prototype of a project we want to pitch soon.   Background  Initially we splitted the Project (Me the tech geek, programming and stuff) and they had the Ideas and were like my customers giving me tasks.  Situation  However I'm very unsatisfied with the profit sharing. Their suggestion was everybody would receive 1/3 of the profit.  But in the end I was the one developing it 100%.  They haven't assisted me in programming (they also have no experience).  Question(s)   How would you guys react to that? Am I overreacting? Are there any other possible solutions than this 1/3 share?   Edit  This was a personal project, no company involved. "
112,Help with stories in Scrum,"The company I work for has recently greenlit a large project to completely rewrite our software product. As PM, I have championed using Scrum on the project and the company have been very supportive of the process.  Howevever this is the first time I, or any of the developers, have been involved on a Scrum project. We've are in the middle of our fourth sprint now, but I have a ton of questions (I'll just stick to my top three for now!)  1) Estimating in Story Points. This is probably the number one thing we struggle with during our planning sessions. At first I got the team to estimate in Ideal Man Days since the concept of Story Points was too alien. However, from the third sprint onwards I've tried to shepherd them into using Story Points (based on effort not time).  Even after two sprints using Story Points I still get the question, ""what does one story point mean?"". Despite the hours of online research I've put in, I myself feel unsure how I should answer this question. I tend to fall back to the Ideal Man Day since it's the easiest thing for everyone to understand, but I would really like to give a definitive answer to the team that isn't fluffy or vague. Unfortunately, almost every explanation I've come across on the web suffers from this. Am I to presume that a Story Point means different things to different teams?  2) Breaking stories down into tasks My question here is how much of the story should be broken down into tasks during the planning session? We have been generating an average of four tasks per story, but some of these could be broken down even further. While I understand that too many tasks is a bad thing, I get concerned when I see the same task in progress for more than a day or two. So I'm a little torn as to how granular the tasks should be.  Also, I've found breaking down a story too much during the planning session was digressing into a design discussion. When I raised this with the team they countered that they needed to fully explore the story in order to generate tasks and help with with the estimatation.  3) Technical Stories From what I've studied, stories should cover a feature of the product that adds value to the business. However, since we are at the beginning of the project, most of our stories tend to be techincal in nature. An recent example of this is, ""As a developer, I need to be able to create a MuleESB app and integrate it into our build environment"". This kind of story adds no value from a business point of view, but is crucial in laying the foundation for the work to come.  My question is whether it is ok to have techincal stories and assign them points. I am concerned that if I don't, then the team's velocity will be very low and it will look like they've not been doing very much; at least in the early phases of the project. "
113,How do I implement Scrum Organization-wide in a lightweight Startup?,"I am implementing Scrum throughout (from business development to engineering to marketing) my six-person organization.  My company consists of three engineers and three Business Development personnel.  As a startup, we have many (25+) simultaneous projects (e.g. close deals, create new marketing material, implement new features, etc...).  Does anyone have any best practices on how to implement and organize Scrum in such a ""multifaceted"" environment?  Everything I've read so far seems to be restrained to teams that have a single cohesive objective. Any ideas? "
114,Writing the perfect proposal,What strategies can I take to write a good project proposal document?  So far the way I write them is that I include 3 main sections:   Technical Details  Delivery Items  Cost Estimation   My understanding is that this should be a document that describes in general how you plan to deal with the project.  Should I go into as many details as possible so early?  
115,What is the difference between requirement and scope?,"Scope is divided into two categories:   Product scope, which is the features and functions that characterize a product, service, or result, and; Project scope, which is all the work needed to deliver a product, service, or result as defined in product scope.    Requirements specifies the capabilities, features or attributes of the project’s deliverables.  Stakeholder needs, wants and wishes are analyzed to derive the requirements.  Requirements are prioritized to determine which requirements will be included and excluded from the project.   Could someone please help me understand the difference between requirements and scope?  Would it be correct to say that scope is more of a macro-level concept and that requirements is more of micro-level concept? "
116,How to track a new employee's activities in scrum template on TFS?,"From this question: How to factor in story points/tasks for non sprint related items?  I gather you would reduce the capacity to a new employee to probably 0 for a while untile they are up to speed after training, pc set up, etc. in order to maintain the velocity of burn down charts accurately.  However would you track their activities through work items in Team Foundation Server or would you just leave their capacity at 0 without any work items? "

120,How to make the Product Owner realize that he doesn't put focus on the right customer at all?,"I'm Technical Leader for a software project dedicated to manage the ""VIP people""-yearOfWork of a big company.  Basically, to make it simple for this post, the project is a mix of a social network (between those VIP people) and a meeting network, where any one of them could be aware and participate to their respective yearly meetings.  My Product Owner is, oddly, not one of those VIP people but one who remotely manages them (creating meetings etc, establishing their profile etc.). He's part of the Secretariat Team. He argues that he knows their jobs and therefore thinks mastering their needs.   The project is supposed to evolve through agile principles, to receive feedbacks early, but:                      Product Owner puts focus on features that is viewable, usable and focus on the management team, HIS team.           Product Owner argues that his team (secretariat) should benefit of this product to spent less times on redundant tasks like creating meeting for VIP people.    Problem is:    The backlog is full of Secretariat-oriented features and I can't see any VIP people-oriented features.   No workshop with customers to study deeply THEIR needs.   We got some feedback that VIP people find the software very light but interesting, but the product owner can't bear of the word ""light"".  Customers are not aware of the amount of tasks under the hood dealing dedicated to the Secretariat Team; I'm sensitive to their ""appointment"".  Product Owner thinks wrongly that the sofware is for HIS team more than VIP people and he's wrong.   How to make the Product Owner realize that he doesn't put focus on the right customer and that it is a huge risk regarding the project's lifetime since whole project budget is almost fully spent?  How to make the Product Owner realize that receiving a feedback like ""pretty good project; but lacks some promised features after 5 months of work"" is not like ""Wow amazing!"" feedback?    I was very disappointed as a technical leader when the customer said: ""5 months for that ?!""; indeed they just see a very very short number of features they can ""play"" with. Rest is hidden from them.  "

122,Dev team's role in configuring Jira,"Let me start by explaining the big, unfixable problem here:  A new Technology Director has been brought in above my team, and he insists on deciding how Jira is configured, affecting people who don't report to him. Despite his insistence to the contrary, he doesn't seem to have the slightest idea how agile or Scrum works, but the rest of the team is very comfortable with these things. He doesn't understand what goes into a standup, and when we forced a retrospective recently, he stared at his laptop the 90 percent of time. This (and his apparent confusing of waterfall and agile) is causing very real problems.  He's a talented programmer, but also kind of a jerk and an inscrutable communicator. He leads by fiat, not by example. It's so bad that I've already decided that I'm leaving (I'm expecting an offer in the next two days), and our senior front-end developer quit right after we hired a very junior front-ender who really needed his mentoring.   Now, to my more narrowly-scoped question  Should someone in this role have a major say in this sort of thing? The way he wants to configure Jira makes no sense to anybody else. How can I push back and advocate for agile and Scrum?  I'm trying to fix as much of this as possible before I leave because I do like the company and I really care about the team and I want to see them succeed.  Any advice on how to help me help my team before I leave would be appreciated. "
123,"In MS Project, can I create a task whose duration depends on two milestones?","I want to show an ongoing ""support"" task in MS Project, where the start date is driven by one milestone (test environment available), and the end date is set by another milestone (testing complete). I do not want to enter a duration or an amount of effort into the plan, as these will vary according to whether my dates vary as the plan evolves. Instead, I would like to have these figures calculated within the system and recalculated automatically if the plan moves.  I feel as though I am missing something obvious, but can't work out what it is. Is this possible, and if so, how do I do it?

128,Is there are a resource handler or gantt chart creator tool for JIRA?,"I'm hoping someone has some experience on tools and/or better keywords to describe this problem:   I have JIRA system for developers where they provide estimates and track time completed. The estimate could be captured in a higher level tool, but the time track (effort applied) should not require double-entry and instead pull from JIRA. There are multiple projects (up to 6 active over a pool of 20 projects) that all have pending work for the limited availability of developers (8 developers). We might have to handle about 80 tasks a week we want to sort, prioritise, and schedule (an average task takes 2 to 4 hours to finish, we have 8 developers, so in the worst case - 4 hours per task - we have 80 tasks = (40 hrs / 4 hrs) * 8 developers).   Is it possible to manage the resources with deadline/timelines and start dates so the developers know what they should be working on across all projects?  Is there a tool that can be used with JIRA (or a plugin) that developers can update their progress (date, priority, etc.) with low effort? "
129,Explanation on the order of Planning Processes in Rita's Process chart,"I am preparing for PMP, currently in Chapter 3 of Rita Mulcahy 's book. I prefer understanding over memorization, the 'why' rather than the 'what'.  I searched on the web to understand why the planning processes are in the order they are listed in Rita's process chart. Some of them are straight forward, but some are not.   Does anyone know where I can find more explanation on the reasoning behind the sequence?  Or is it simply that it is explained better in later chapters, so just memorize for now and understand later? Please help! "
130,"If SAFe must be continuously calibrated and measured in ideal days, why does the framework say recalibration is unnecessary?","TL;DR  SAFe says you don't need to recalibrate estimation, but requires estimates and other metrics to be normalized across one or more Agile Release Trains. Context, question rationale, and the question itself (stated in a more answerable form) are below.  Context of the Question  One of the core practices of SAFe appears to be the use of normalized story points on which to base planning and costing decisions within the framework. Version 4.5 of the framework says:     SAFe uses a starting baseline where one story point is defined roughly the same across all teams. This means that work can be prioritized based on converting story points to cost...In this way, story points are somewhat comparable to an ideal developer day, and all teams estimate using a common method.   Functionally, this results in estimations being done in ideal working days rather than strictly relative level-of-effort scaling. No aspect of the framework appears to offer any alternative to ideal-days estimation, or define a point at which estimation is ever unmoored from man-hours. Furthermore, in the comments section of a now-deleted post, Dean Leffingwell has directly stated that normalized estimates are not a one-time thing. Specifically, he said:     Velocities are NOT normalized across teams. Estimating is. If you don’t normalize estimating, then there is no meaningful economics; you can’t figure ROI if you don’t know that the “I” is. If you want to scale agile, and there is no meaningful way to bid work across teams, and within a program, you will be blocked before you even try.   Why Ask This Question?  The point of the question isn't to debate whether or not this is an anti-pattern, but rather to understand this rather vague note on the page which says:     Note: There is no need to recalibrate team estimation or velocity after that point. It is just a starting baseline.   Authorial intent here seems unclear. Does it mean no recalibration within a PI Planning increment, or at any point within the process? Given the preceding context, it seems like normalizing of the estimation process (and therefore SAFe-specific application of measures like story points, load, velocity, and cumulative flow) is foundational to the framework.  The Question  Is there any mechanism within SAFe to estimate in level-of-effort rather than ideal days? In either case, how does the admonition that recalibration is unnecessary fit in with the framework's ongoing requirement to normalize metrics across teams? "
131,Catch-Up Scheduling,"Say I have a project X that is due to be complete by Date Y Right now we are 10% behind schedule (Should be say 50% and right now 40%), How can I estimate what level of ""effort"" is required to catch up?   I.E. the original schedule expected 1% of units of work a day to be done, but to catchup to the schedule by some date Z (which is &lt;= Y), we need to work 1.2% units of work a day, I'm looking for a way to identify the 1.2% units part based on an existing schedule.  I'm not sure what this is called but if someone that has editing rights has a better idea for the phrasing, I would be grateful if they could reword it.  Hoping this doesn't make it a ""tool recommendation, or shopping question"", again reword if it sounds like it, however if you know how to find the above information using tool, can you please provide a ""how to"" on that tool, this is really what I'm looking for, my project is currently using MS-Project, but I don't think it would be too tricky to insert ""start/end dates"" into another tool, if it has this feature? I would ultimately like to be able to run a report estimating what ""units of work per day"" are required to complete the entire project, broken down by tasks that are behind only. "
132,What are the benefits of queuing tasks as opposed to assigning them?,"When something needs to be done, be it a new task or getting help with an existing one, a knee-jerk reaction I've often seen in the wild is finding a person to do it.  Here are some random examples of this:  ""I need to see the logs, who do I talk to?""  ""I want this patch to be merged, who can help me?""  ""I want that button to behave differently, who's available to work on this?""  Sometimes people would assume that a single actor is always available and waiting to perform a particular task (""if I want to see the logs, I go to Josh, he'd always help me with that"").  Other times people would assume that a single router is always available (""if I want something implemented, this manager, Bob, can always help me finding the right person for the job"").  Sometimes the tasks will be assigned at random (""I get assigned to tasks randomly (kind of)"" - Best way to divide &amp; assign development work on projects?).  I think that this is colloquially known as ""push"".  On the other hand, some development methodologies (Lean, Scrum, Kanban) seem to prefer the ""pull"" approach, when instead of being handed to a particular person (and sometimes through a routing person) the tasks are queued somewhere (on a Kanban board, in a Scrum backlog, etc) to be picked up by the team members.  I wonder, what are the benefits of the ""pull"" approach? It might be useful to enumerate them. "
133,How to start my first project?,"I'm going to manage my first project that is really a small stream of an even greater project, and my boss said that I could make my own schedule and plans etc.  I have a couple of questions, I need some help with:   When it comes to organizing meetings, is one meeting per week enough? How often do I need to catch-up with developers? Do I need to come by once a day and check-up on their status? What kind of planning should I do? What is the best way to plan the projects development status? What should I avoid when I'm about to do planning?   My background: I have been doing a great amount of Resource Management and Project Coordination before taking on this role, and before that I had been an IT Engineer, but it all changed when I decided to switch careers and started my part-time MBA.

134,How to estimate times during Sprint Planning?,"I have 6 user stories for a sprint of 14 days. I have the detailed description in the stories for what the team needs to develop, and the team is new to scrum. (this would be their 2nd sprint). The only thing I haven't done so far is to assign an estimate to the stories, using a systematic approach. (like a point system). I want to start with Agile planning poker approach, but how do I assign a number of days after the developer assigns a size (number, color etc) to a story? My point is why do we need to have a point system if we are eventually going to estimate in terms of days? "
135,Acceptance Testing fails on owners machines only,"I'm in the process of completing the acceptance testing with a customer for a web based system and after 3 rounds of acceptance testing we have found that one particular feature of the system does for some reason not work on the clients 2 machines we have used for testing.  It is pretty unusual for a browser based application and we have gone through an in-detail compare of the computers and the test environment. There are also possible programming problems that may exascerbate the problem  Unfortunately a lot of other things have gone wrong in the project as well, and this has contributed to a loss of trust and made acceptance testing very tedious.  I'm looking for ways to manage this better in the future, apart from of course identifying the actual difference that is causing this.  Can people here recommend project management and contractual preparations that are realistic for this scenario? The applications target market is only about 100 people with the 2 key people at the client obviously being super admins of the system.   my business partner thinks its too hard a requirement to force acceptance testing as complete if only tested on a platform like browserstack.com - what do other people think should I include the right to force a memory test or other IT checks on the desgnated test equipment? or is this simply something that can happen, bad luck?

138,MS Project - Span a task over many days AND allow successor to start right after,"I am planning my Master thesis through Microsoft Project. Since some tasks can be exhausting (e.g. writing), I would like to distribute some selected tasks over many days. For example, I am estimating that working on a section of the thesis would take 9 hours, but I would like to distribute the 9 hours over 3 days (3 hours/day).  One example of my setup for a given task is the following:   Unit type: Fixed Duration Duration: 3 days Hours: 9 hours.   However, my issue is with the following task. Here is a screen capture:    As you may see, the task number 6, which has a work duration of 1h, is automatically setup the next working day. However, it is weird since I obviously have the time to do this task right after its predecessors, the same day its finish (my working hours is 9 to 1h30PM, then having 4.5 hours per day available).   All allocation is done automatically using leveling. I tried to reset the start and finish date (since Project consider task 5 to finish at the ""end"" of the day), but I still have the issue. Both working time and Option-->Schedule-->Hours per day are set up at 4.5 hours per day.  Any idea why Project refuse to behave nicely!? Is there another way to better set up my task for a better hours distribution over days?  Thank you for your help!  Maxime "
139,Being pressured into doing a Gantt chart,"Currently in a proxy product owner/Scrum master role, I do my planning in the following way:   Weekly Retrospectives at the end of the week, sprint review on Mondays (with the stakeholder) followed by a Sprint planning meeting.   My boss the product owner has been asking me to show a gantt chart for a couple of months. I have been really pushing back on doing this because of the following reasons:   It's based on time when I measure performance based on the teams velocity It is too high level. Currently one of the problems that I am currently seeing is where our original plan gets skewed by unforeseen customer requests, resulting in new features being developed for the platform which we did not originally scope. Since I do my planning weekly, I am able to adapt to change requests as they come in by adding it in the following sprint. If I have a gantt, the planning becomes very rigid if followed 100%. I do not want to commit to it, only for it to bite me in the ass with my boss saying 'you promised x and y thing on week 7 why hasn't it been delivered?' irrespective if we were forced to work on other things in that time.   I am thinking about doing a high level gantt chart just to keep my boss happy.   Can I do this (even if it is inaccurate) on a sprint by sprint bases?  We aim to complete x y think on x week then z thing on y week.  UPDATE TO SINCE THIS QUESTION WAS POSTED  I have been doing this for 2 weeks  Pros of Gantt Charts   Gives a high lever overview on how you plan to structure upcoming sprints, that is easy to see. It can be used as a product roadmap.   Drawbacks    Too rigid, cannot adapt to change at all. I have found that once requirements came in that were not originally specced, it went out of whack.   You can probably use a Gantt chart as long as you inform your stakeholder that it is subject to change. "
140,My boss says a Senior PM should show more commitment,"As a PM I am working with a team and I almost always define our times, however, sometimes my boss stipulates a deadline to the presentation, and even when I discuss it with him he explains the project won't be on budget if we don't get it on time.  Is it my responsability to work extra hours to get the presentation on time, or should he discard the project if he's not willing to spend additional resources on it?  I also have other extra curricular responsabilities, but he says that since we are working for objectives and with the additional fact that me and my team has somewhat freedom to make our inner management, that we should repay it, without complain, or at least I should repay it, since I'm responsable for the project.

142,Scrum or V-Cycle?,"Contextual Information  I have problems in describing the Development Process of my project.  I'm doing my internship in an enterprise as an Information Systems designer and Java EE developer, for graduation. I need to talk about the development process and the project organisation in my report.   I asked my boss about the development process they are performing in the enterprise and he confirmed to me that it is Scrum.   My subject is about Intranet. We have started by the most complex module in the intranet. The expected period of time to finish it is 5 months. After we finish this module we start another one.  So during these 5 months, we are expecting to specify the requirements of the module, to design an Information System which satisfy the requirements, to design a software architecture, to develop then integrate then test then validate, and then to move to another module. These steps make me feel that we have used the V-Cycle described here.  However, we have been doing Scrum practises such as doing a daily follow-up between the Scrum Team and the Scrum Master ( what have you done yesterday? have u got any difficulties? what will you do today?... ) during a meeting of 5 minutes. We are a team of 3 persons, we have a Scrum Master, and 2 Product Owners.  I talked to my boss and he said he will divide 5 months into sprints of 2 or 3 weeks ( a sprint of designing, a sprint of implementing a working prototype...,.., a sprint of testing ).   However, what I learnt at my college is that every sprint gives us a version, a product which we can use but that we need to improve.   Sorry for this long text, but I needed to make you in my context to be able to help me in describing the development process of this project. Thank you a lot!  My Question  Could these be Sprints?

146,Managing small + large tasks on a big website with Scrum,"We're a small team of 4 developers who manage one large website and a group of minisites/mobile apps. We've used JIRA/Agile and Scrum, as best we can, to manage the workflow for the last few months.  However we're struggling to manage a backlog which consists of;   Small tasks (move a button, change a word) Large tasks (a new section of features) Non-related tasks (build a new minisite)   Now our main project has versions (and we're talking about milestones), and the mini projects rely on versioned subsystems from other projects. We're finding it very difficult to have a sane meeting with a disorganised backlog.  How do we manage small tasks and big ideas in the same list? How should project boards, epics, stories and sub-tasks relate to milestones, versions, large features and small tasks?  As an inexperienced ScrumMaster I feel like I'm letting the side down.

But what about the maintenance phase? In case there's no development at all but mainly investigations raised by end users (why X is like this and not like that?), how to evaluate our peers?  There are the basics, like 'communication' and 'investigation' skills... but as an IT company,    How to keep our team improving their tech background on a project where no complex technical skills are required?

That mockup is delivered as part of the story, but may or may not be considered actual acceptance criteria.  After all, the mock may not even look finished or behave correctly.  So how can it be considered AC?  When the developer delivers the product the designer looks at it and doesn't like the result.  The designer requests N# of changes mid sprint.  This is a cause of scope creep because these changes: colors, scroll behavior, font used, hover behavior etc were not captured prior to the start of the sprint.  How can this process be improved? "
151,How to eliminate wasted time / improve cadence on epic boundaries,"Our work is organized around epics, which are the unit of business decision making and prioritization. Each represents a higher-level business feature or technical task. Epics are divided into user stories and take usually 1-3 weeks to finish in a team.  Our team works in a kanban-ish process where we pull stories from the epic, mixing in bugs and sustaining tasks as needed. There are no time-boxed sprints. We follow the rule that WIP is limited to 1 epic.  The problem I've noticed is that there seems to be a lot of time wasted on the boundary between epics. Towards the end of work on an epic, we get increasingly blocked by lack of tasks we can work on or dependencies. We've tried increasing WIP to 2 epics but it didn't help much - there's still hesitation and waste before we open a new epic.  How can we improve our process to eliminate wasted time on the boundary between subsequent epics? Does limiting number or epics in progress make sense? Should we put a limit on WIP for stories only? "
152,Splitting stories to keep Development and QA at 100% utilization at all times,"Even if we make many small stories, we still end up splitting stories at the end of every Sprint because we cannot have Development under-utilized while QA is testing, and we cannot have QA being idle waiting for coding changes to test.   So there are always at least three stories (we have three developers) and two QA tests (two testers) unfinished at the end of the sprint.   How do others handle this issue? How do you keep your team continually working at top efficiency without splitting stories? "
153,Mapping value stream for a feature suggestion to working software process,"I'm trying to get a gist of Value Stream Mapping and how to apply it to a suggestion to working software process that we have.   Since we are developing products, and don't do client work, there's no hard ""pull"" - customer requests something, and if sufficient number of people is interested we'll consider adding it.   Here are the steps:   Customer requests a feature, Support records feedback and adds +1 for the feature, Support prepares a monthly report, Product owner reviews the suggestions report, Product owner decides that feature should be developed, Feature is analyzed and designed, We wait until one development team is free to take on the feature, Product owner presents the feature to the development team, Team has a (longish) meeting where feature is broken down to small tasks, and each task is given an estimate. Based on these estimates, due date is set, Team implements a feature, QA is done (feedback loop included, developers may need to correct the software) Code review is done (feedback loop included, developers may need to correct the software) Documentation is written Announcement data is written Feature is released Customers who requested the feature are informed   That's a lot of steps. I included everything, for the sake of an exercise. Which of these steps would you consider Value Adding and which Non-Value Adding and why?   One bit in particular pushed me to create this question: should we consider detailed estimation step VA or NVA? Developers do a lot of design work in that stage, so I'm not 100% sure where to put it.

154,Finding out whether a decision made has been risk-taking or risk-averse,"I want to do an empirical study on risk management by translation trainees for my MA thesis. Translation is an act full of decision-makings for rendering risky parts of the text. I want to interpret each decision the subjects make in their own context, and I believe the only tool I have to assess whether the decisions made are risk-averse or risk-taking is to interpret justifications they provide for the decisions they make (both when thinking out loud and in the interview I will have with them after the task). But I need a framework for the basis of such interpretations; I guess something that specifies A, B, and C types of arguments in their justifications show that their decision has been risk-taking, and X, Y, and Z arguments show that their decision has been risk-averse. Something that can be applied to each decision made, not an overall approach to the decision-maker's characteristics. Do you suggest any theoretical framework for such work?  P.S.: Risk in translation? Well, some believe risk is ""The probability of a desired or an undesired outcome as a consequence of a (translational) action"". Pym also argues that each text consists of high-risk, medium-risk, and low-risk items, e.g. the title in a letter is a high-risk item (very important in communication) but conjunctions are low-risk items. Pym also raises this idea that translators deal with 3 kinds of risks: credibility risk (keeping/losing the reputation as the translator), uncertainty risk (about HOW to translate items), and communicative risk (which is related to the text itself). On the other hand, some scholars believe that each element of a text can have political, economic, etc. type of risk within itself, but they do not raise this idea in a structured way.The latter group believes that for example if you are working for a Pan-X newspaper and translate the item Y in a way which is opposing the ideologies of the newspaper, you are taking a risk, because it can make you get fired. [Which sense you find reasonable, by the way?] "
155,Scrum team committments,"If my Scrum team is always completing 100% of their committed items, is that a good thing? Given the amount of variability in software development, this would seem to indicate something is fishy to me, but the prevailing philosophy seems to be that something is if they aren't always completing 100% of committed scope.  If you think that not completing 100% of committed scope every sprint is ok, what % of the time would you expect them to be wrong, and how far off would you expect them to be before you thought there was a problem that needed to be directly addressed?

156,How to describe a system,"I am new to this community and please go easy on me.  I have been doing C# dev for like 10 years and recently I am considering a Business Analyst (BA) position. When I applied for the role, the manager asked me to do some little homework and I hope I can get some advice from you.  The preparation for the interview was to describe an existing cinema online booking system in 200 words.  What got me was the number of words as 200 words isnt much and it makes thing tricky. I want to get some advice on if there is any specific BA way to describe a system. How would you describe a system in 200 words? would you do that in point form?  Update:  I realised I didn't make my question very clear. I was asked to describe a particular cinema movie booking system, so it is not any booking system. I just didn't want to name the particular cinema in my question.  I can even try to explain my approach and hope everyone can tell me if this is a BA way to doing it.   Evaluated the booking system and understood its booking process Drew up a UML Sequence diagram to note down the end-to-end booking steps  Translating the booking process from diagram into words   Hope this is something acceptable for most "
157,How to track identical Agile/Scrum PBIs for multiple platforms not in sync?,"Brief Background  Our company uses Agile/Scrum as our development methodology, with Microsoft's VSTS (Visual Studio Team Services) being our tool of choice.  We have several teams, including Android, IOS/iPhone, and backend/server teams, all working on our company's flagship product.  For historical reasons, the IOS product lags behind the Android product feature-wise, and the IOS team works hard to ""catch up"" and bring their product up-to-date.  How does the Agile/Scrum process work for us?  As the Product Owner, I typically author a new PBI (""P"") for a feature we want to implement in an upcoming sprint.  At the Sprint Planning meeting, the Android and iPhone teams propose the child tasks needed to implement PBI ""P"".  By the meeting's end, this PBI will have one or more child tasks associated with both Android and iPhone.  What's the problem?  Because the iPhone team needs to catch up on older feature still unimplemented in the product, they frequently do not have the time during the sprint to implement their tasks in PBI ""P"".  Alternatively, the state of the IOS product precludes their working on PBI ""P"" because some other functionality is not yet implemented.  In other words, there is an unrealistic coupling of the two teams together through a common PBI.  At the end of the sprint I have a dilemma: the IOS team's inability to complete their tasks together with the Android team prevents me from marking the PBI as ""done"".  I have the unenviable choice of:   splitting the PBI, moving the undone tasks to a new PBI leaving the PBI as undone for a later sprint   I'd like to split the PBI by platform  I've come to the conclusion that the only solution to tracking the Android and IOS teams without running into the problems mentioned above is to split (or clone) the PBI into two PBIs: one for tracking Android, the other for IOS.  Whatever the solution is, it should support a single source of requirements and encourage details reuse.  Possible Methods for Splitting the PBI (none are satisfactory)  There are two methods I can think of for implementing splitting a PBI by platform.  First Method: Make two copies of the PBI, one each for Android and IOS  In this method, the Product Owner authors the PBI, complete with a full description of the user story, to be used to track the Android team.  Once completed, an identical PBI is created for tracking the IOS team.  The obvious drawback here is data redundancy: If the user story is updated in one, it must be updated in the other.  In addition, any discussion thread that grows in one PBI might not be seen by the other team working on theirs.  Second Method: Use the Epic / Feature / PBI hierarchy  This method takes advantage of VSTS's addition of two 'portfolio backlog' types: 'epic' and 'feature'.  An 'epic' is the highest-level backlog, and can contain one or more 'features', which in turn can contain one or more PBIs.  My idea is for the Product Owner to write his/her user stories in a 'feature' rather than in a PBI.  This 'feature' will contain the entire user story in a platform-agnostic fashion.  This feature should not deal at all with anything platform-specific.  This 'feature' will contain within (below) it two platform-specific PBIs for Android and IOS, as the following diagram illustrates:    The advantages here are that any changes to the original user story will be made in the feature, not within a PBI.  In this way, both platforms have only to look at their parent to see the latest-and-greatest user story.  Any platform-specific comments or additions to the user story should be made in the PBI.  In the even that a PBI does not need to be implemented by different platforms (e.g., it is a PBI for the backend/server group) the user story can be written in a PBI, without making use of a feature.  Questions   Is this scheme an acceptable one?  Does it violate the Agile/Scrum methodology in any way? Does anyone have an alternative solution to track a PBI across multiple platforms without major disadvantages?  "
158,What techniques are useful when factoring in the likelihood that one or more members of the team may take leave during a project?,"What's the best way of planning for the possibility that a key member(s) of the team might want to take leave at some point during a project?  I understand one solution is to buffer the project sufficiently so that the project / task can soak up this time without affecting key milestones, however - it strikes me that building in this sort of buffer as standard for all tasks in the project will very quickly start to add a significant amount of bloat into the project.  I also find that buffer time can become ""dead time"". For example, our validation department operate a fairly tight timetable, therefore if you assume a task has a two week buffer after it - and validation has been booked after that two week period - what happens when that buffer isn't needed (the task runs to time) - that leads to a two week delay before moving to the next activity (the validation team isn't available until the week it was booked for).  Is this just basic project management stuff - i.e. if the buffer isn't used, great - the team move onto something else for two weeks?  Would welcome thoughts on this topic. "
159,As a project manager how worthwhile is it to have 50/50 estimates of certain metrics?,"I was reading Steve Tockey's book Return on Software and he mentioned it's quite beneficial to have such estimates. Let's say I have an oracle that spews out 50/50 estimates of cost/schedule/budget/size (function-point, story point etc.,) for a software project. You are equally likely to overshoot as you are to undershoot the estimate.  The question is, is such an estimate really worth it? Why or why not? Intuitively it seems to make sense, but upper management would want more confidence for their planning - but you can only get that from widening your range and maybe from historical data! But that is only a 'sense of security' and maybe totally false, since you can't really say if you overshot it was 10% likely and hence it's justified since you really don't know what that 10% even means, to be honest (I've seen people claim only 10-15% risk and don't even know where the percentages came from or what do they signify).  I could increase my confidence by widening the range substantially but it doesn't give anyone much information.  So if I were to put forth a 50/50 estimate of things would my life be any better?? How would/should a PM manage for such estimates?  UPDATE: I would like to clarify a point: It's not that we are just using the 50/50 estimate and basing everything on it. You could say that is our 'mean estimate' i.e., based on past data of actuals vs. estimates. We then specify a range using n-standard deviations depending on our required confidence. So the point is that our 'initial estimate' is the 50/50 point (the mean) - we are equally likely to be under/over it (it's an estimate!). Now having such a point and the +/- range around it how worthwhile is this estimate? "
160,Influence code quality as Scrum Product Owner,"Introduction: In theory, Scrum says that the development team is fully responsible and self-organized when it comes to all things related to development. This also includes code quality which imho is a result of CI, automated testing and more.   Scenario: A Scrum Product Owner is responsible for some software product. The quality lately decreased due to increasing complexity.  Question: How can the Scrum Product Owner influence the development in a way that they look more into quality? Items in the product backlog are features that have direct customer value. Code quality only has indirect customer value. Can the Product Owner force the dev team to increase quality, e.g. by using CI, more/better automated tests, ... ?  "
161,Agile requirements tracking,"I am new to this forum, I will try to explain the best I can what I am facing. I recently entered a new software development company, and I am the coordinator of a team of Product Owners (POs) who (each of them) are in charge of 5 different products.  The thing is that none of them document anything. The business sends requests on a daily basis and they write each requirement just in a simple JIRA issue, so they are not so easy to understand and cannot be properly documented.  On one hand, I am trying to educate the business regarding these practices (but they are very demanding so I don't think I will have luck on that). On the other hand, and here comes my question: given the rush of daily activities, I don't want to be pushing the POs to document every single request that comes in.  So, when would it be appropriate to formally document requirements? I mean, should we only keep track of requirements when they are long ones, and write daily, short ones is just an issue? "
162,Back-and-forth questions in daily stand-up meeting,"In the context of daily stand-ups in scrum meetings, when the banter gets too heinous, what criteria should a scrummaster set for back-and-forth questions?    Say for instance, there's a developer and a tester working on the same thing, and the tester has questions for the developer about what they did the previous day (one is on the phone, so you can't just give 'em nasty looks or step on their feet), which are usually pertinent to the goals of the entire team and they keep it pretty quick (about 30 seconds to a minute).  What should a scrummaster or a member of the scrum team do?  Is it not within their rights as fellow team members to ask clarifying questions of each other?    If it is even appropriate, when could these questions be asked?  Right after the first person finished their piece or when the second person's turn comes around?  "

166,Give visibility to work being done by a subcontractor,"My company has subcontracted a project and the subcontractor is using their own instance of JIRA to manage their work.  Because we use a different tool I opted to let them use the tools they know and work instead of giving them access to our tool and asked to spend some time ""learning"" and adapting their workflow.   I have visibility of the project because I can track their project board, but I want to bring some visibility to the rest of my organization as well.   What I don't want to do is duplicate all of the stories in JIRA to our own PM tool, so what is the alternative?

167,Boss is making me liable for developers actions,"As an agile project manager, I am currently working with one sub contractor, the problem that I am currently facing is that he is just not pulling his weight with not only doing the work but also answering technical queries, and my boss is expecting me to investigate and on a theoretical level solve the problem for him.  I do not mind at all doing this, but I have expressed the following concerns:   I am not an expert in that particular technology, so I am much more prone to making an error than if it is him -  who is an expert in that technology. I am happy to support him, providing that he contributes to the investigation too. Which is not what he is doing. He is expecting me to hand hold him. I feel that since I am not hands on coding, the support that I can provide is limited, given that I cannot try different things out with the code. If I am required to start developing, than that is going beyond my job description. I have made it clear to my boss that I have no interest at all writing code again. I feel that at best I can point him in the right direction and give suggestions on how to solve the problem, but in the end, he has to find the solution.  My boss doesn't seem to get that and expects me to hand hold him. I am much more interested in project management activities, requirement gathering, optimising my sprints, organising my backlog, reading burn down charts, making sure scrum is followed properly and so on.   How can I convey this to my boss without getting to confrontational? Is he correct, and is the level of support that I am supposed to provide? "
168,How to set story points when two people work on the same item together?,"How to handle points in the following scenario:  We have a story set to 4 points, because the team believes that the amount of work is 4 points in total. To be able to complete this story, two people with their special knowledge, needs to work together on that item.   This does not that the first person will do the first half, then the next person will do the second half, they will have to do all of the four points together, by pair programming for instance.  It seems unfair to say that if both persons have 8 points each in a sprint, we can fit four 4 point stories in. Since both will be working together, only 2 four point stories will fit.   How to handle this? Should the points of the story be increased or should the peoples capacity be lowered somehow?  "
169,Estimate depending work items in Scrum,"Scenario: Let's say there are two items A and B in the product backlog of a Scrum team. From a PO point of view B has more customer value than A and is therefore ranked higher. When asking a developer for the estimated time to work on these items he gives the following input:   A takes 2 days B takes 2 days; but if A is done before then B only takes 1 day (as some prerequisite work is done in A as well)   This means that, when B is done first and then A, the overall time for those two work items is 4 days. But when A is done before B the overall work time will be 1 day. But this will be against the priorities as B is ranked higher than A.  Please assume that both work items cannot be completed in the same sprint. Otherwise, there is no need for this question :)  Actual question: Should estimates incorporate such information?  Our thinking: We've been discussing this yesterday on whether the estimates for work items should keep this in mind. Should a PO have this information to reorder the product backlog based on this information? We came to the conclusion that estimates should not contain this information, i.e. B takes 2 days time, period.  The reasons for that are:   The product backlog is ordered based on customer value When B shares a task with A, what about the other items? There will probably be more tasks like that that need to be looked at. This will lead to long lasting discussions without a reliable result.   Are we missing sth. or is our thinking correct? There are probably more reasons to add to that list. "
170,How do unknown-scope projects achieve project-level estimation with regards to the CMMI's Project Planning Specific Goal?,"Specific Goal (SG) 1 of the Project Planning process area in CMMI (assessed at CMMI Level 2) is to establish estimates. One of the Specific Practices (SPs) that is recommended to achieve this goal is to estimate the scope of the project. In all of the CMMI literature that I have access to, it explicitly calls out the creation and maintenance of a work breakdown structure (WBS) to achieve this goal. However, not all projects have a clearly defined scope at the outset, making the creation of a WBS (or any type of project-level estimation) difficult. I'm aware that the CMMI is a process framework that's designed to be tailored, but the frequent and explicit mentions of the use of a WBS, rather than the use of example tools, to achieve this goal is rather confusing.  The use of a WBS, specifically the 100% rule, appears to me to be difficult to achieve in many such environments:     The 100% rule states that the WBS includes 100% of the work defined by the project scope and captures all deliverables – internal, external, interim – in terms of the work to be completed, including project management.   Agile methodologies are best suited to this situations, when the project requirements or scope are not well understood. If you don't fully understand the requirements and/or scope, it's not possible to create a 100% complete WBS for the entire project scope. A WBS is better suited in a plan-driven project where the requirements are less volatile and the scope of the project is well defined.  One possible option would be to create and continually refine the WBS to accurately reflect the current understanding of the project, that seems to go against the principles of agile/lean documentation. In terms of the overall process, the existance of the WBS adds no value to the development team and producing and modifying it is wasteful. Another option might be to create a WBS on a per-iteration basis (especially if the iterations are longer), but this would be capturing the same information that might be captured in the form of the product backlog, stories, use cases, and just reformatted to ""check the box"" of having a WBS, which again doesn't seem very agile/lean.  I found one academic paper (PDF) that appears to suggest that the appropriate mapping from Scrum to this process area is to indeed create a WBS at the beginning of each sprint. However, some aspects of this paper make me question if the authors have a good grasp of Scrum as a project management framework. For example, the authors write      There are not explicit orientations in SCRUM to establish, for   instance, size and/or complexity of items of Product Backlog and   Sprint Backlog.   This is true, however individual teams generally develop a consistent process for determining these values. For example, a common method is using Planning Poker to determine the Story Points associated with each User Story in the backlog. The Scrum framework allows teams to choose what works for them, and encourages consistency when peforming such a task.  There are also a few other instances of similar questionable statements.  I'm well aware that the identified Specific Practices (SPs) in CMMI are a model for organizations to follow. An organization can develop their own practices, as long as they meet the Specific Goal (SG) of the area. Many of the SPs are written to be along the lines of ""best practices"" for projects, process, quality, and continuous improvement and can be applied to any project. In addition, the SPs provide examples of tools, techniques, and methodologies that might be used to carry out the practice to achieve the goal. However, SP 1.1 (Estimate the Scope of the Project) is something that can't (easily) be done on a number of projects with vague scope, yet must be addressed somehow to achieve/maintain CMMI Level 2.  What techniques have organizations used to achieve this goal on projects with a poorly-defined scope in a manner acceptable within the CMMI framework and reach or surpass CMMI Level 2? Are there any issues with introducing alternative means of producing estimates during an audit? What feedback has been provided by the SEI or CMMI auditors  to companies regarding what should be done regarding projects with vague scope? Is this a practice that can simply be neglected in projects that are difficult to estimate as a whole unit, as long as the specific goals of establishing estimates for work and tasks, defining life cycles, and smaller scale cost/effort estimations are maintained?

187,How to deal with an impatient stakeholder?,"I am the scrum master, proxy product owner here - what is the best way to deal with an impatient stakeholder? At first I was able to tolerate it, but it is becoming stressful.  To give a few examples:   The team have committed to delivering work based on a product roadmap that the Product Owner and I have agreed on. I have then planned the resources to deliver work based on that roadmap by organising my upcoming sprints accordingly.    We've used a Gaant chart in this case, just to visualise upcoming sprints - although this is not set in stone and the PO is aware.   The team have delivered everything requested often ahead of schedule.   As sprints are undertaken, and work has been delivered based on what has been agreed, I have then been faced the following issues:   It is difficult to please him with the quantity of work delivered on a weekly bases.    This is irrespective on the amount of work that has been delivered, he keeps wanting more and more to the point that I keep having slightly heated conversations with him, telling him that without the team working unpaid overtime (which they have told me that they do not want to do), it is not possible to deliver 60 hours work in a 40 hour week.   The stress of him having a go at me is starting to affect me, since I often find it hard to relax at work, not knowing if what we have done on a weekly bases is good enough. I have members of staff in the scrum team working their butts off, to the point one developer right now is coming into work sick, so that he can help the rest of the scrum team meet their sprints. Product owner seems to take no interest in learning low level of agile. I often break high level functionality into very small pieces i.e. user stories so that it is manageable for the team. This has created some tension with the PO, since he thinks stories should not be broken into slices but be one story that contains sub features.   So to give one example, the team were asked to implement a report. The report has a search feature, a table which contains data and a filter to view report by date range.  I would break that one feature down into 3:  Story 1: Table  Story 2: Search Story 3: filter  Since they are all features in themselves.  I have told him that it is important that features are properly broken down otherwise I can't make forecasts on when they will be delivered and at what quality.   PO tells me in private that I am doing a good job despite his bitching.   Finally, after introducing my project management approach, the product is much better than what he had before since my team rewrote the old product from it being badly written - previously he was managing that. He knows this and has acknowledged this, but the stress and constant bitching is getting to me. How do you guys handle this?  Thanks "

191,How to Record Bugs Following User Story Completion - in Large Projects,"We run scrum agile methodology and have a development environment for development. At the end of each sprint, we close off all the tasks/stories that have been completed and promote the code/system to the user test environment.  As bugs are found during testing, they are put into the sprint backlog.   Ordinarily, bugs are quite small defects, relative to the development and we raise these as bugs.  But, if it is found that the original user story wasn't really completed correctly, should the original user story be reopened?  -- Edit --  Following some very worthwhile comments/answers, which have got me thinking, I think I would clarify the situation, drawing together my comments.  The project is the delivery of a Tb data warehouse project consolidating data from 8 source systems, with about 30 developers and a dozen testers. We have defined user stories but, specifically due the difficult UAT process, the Definition of Done for a user story, is to pass unit testing and pass some fairly superficial system and integration testing. This may be an incorrect thing to do, and is the crux of my question now!   The UAT process is quite long winded and takes    several days to create the environment 24 hours of continual elapsed time to loading the data from the source systems into the data warehouse. This time could be sped up, with lots of ££ spent on hardware, which the project doesn't have. 3 days to perform the actual tests. Some are automated using a front end portal, others are execution of data from the source systems and comparing to the data warehouse. This time could be sped up to 2 days with some more staff.   So within a 3 week sprint, this is not really feasible to fit in, as there needs to be a code freeze of all the developers at a point in the week which is then promoted to the UAT environment, then the above process is performed. We would roughly lose one third of our sprint in testing, where the developers would not be doing anything, because if they did, then their code would need UAT and couldn't be delivered in the current sprint.  Currently we are reopening user stories that have been closed when bugs are found, inserting a new ""bug"" subtask and then putting that into the backlog.  I would be interested particularly in hearing from someone who has engaged with a large project; that is not to invalidate people with good theory or small project knowledge.   Is this the correct way to do things?  "
192,Scrum certification for Release manager managing agile releases,"I have a query on Agile certification - which one is best for me or would none be best?  Basically I'm into release management, driving the day to day activities of a software release from end-to-end.  My primary role and responsibility includes coordinating with interfaces to set up test environments, coordinating test cases/users and production deployment/planning/risk assessment from the process perspective/ITIL.  Our team follows the Agile/Scrum approach so we are familiar with user stories, sprints and JIRA. However, I am not a Scrum Master, Product Owner, nor am I a member of the development team.  Will doing EXIN agile foundation/advanced or CSM or PSM help in any way? Will it help me to qualify for Scrum Master roles? "
193,What we should do with tasks which estimated time bigger than sprint?,"I know, we need to separate this task to several subtasks. But what we should do, if further division of this task have no sense? What if all of resulting subtasks will have no business value until all of them will be done and integrated together?  Maybe it seems that this is a little artificial situation, but sometimes it could happen (especially, if you have short sprints).  Example from my practice: we have User Story to allow user make payment from our system. As a part of this story we have task to integrated 3'th party payment service to our project. So, all subtasks of this task are absolutely technical and have no buisness value.  So, I see only three ways to solve this problem:   Separate business valuable task to several technical tasks. But in this case we will not make something useful in first sprint and we will not have anything to show in review. Make all sprints bigger. Maybe our sprints too short and it will be better make it bigger. In this case we will reduce feedback speed, but situation like I described below can never happen again. Make current sprint bigger. As I know, this is not scrum-way solution. Scrum like constancy (make Daily Scrum in same place and same time, fixed limited time-boxes and so on). Plus, it will be hard reconcile new rewiev day with stakeholders. If you have another teams, that work on same project, problems with this solution will be much bigger.   Which solution is better? Or, maybe, somebody know better way to solve this problem? "

How should I show this Non-FR? "
195,Can I have partial acceptance of Work Breakdown Structure packages?,"I've got a project based on a WBS with 4 main phases:   Project Initiation Planning Implementation Acceptance   I would like to do some kind of partial acceptance during implementation for a few already-implemented requirements. Do the necessary work items have to be part of the implementation phase or the acceptance phase?   Basically, in a timeline the implementation phase would look like:   Implement requirement 1 Implement requirement 2 Acceptance of requirement 1 &amp; 2 Implement requirement 3 Implement requirement 4 Acceptance of requirement 3 &amp; 4   Afterwards there would be the acceptance phase with the big acceptance of the whole project. Should I put work item 3 into phase ""implementation"" or into phase ""acceptance""? "
196,"What we should do, if after planning we still have some free time in Sprint (i.e. unused forecasted capacity) and no tasks that will fit in it","A question about Sprint planning. Let's assume, that Team velocity are 20 Story Point (SP). The most prior Stories in Product Backlog are A (12 SP), B (5 SP) and C (4 SP).  It's easy to see, that if we will take all three tasks (21 SP), most likely we will not finish task C. But if we take only A and B (17 SP) we will finish sprint early.  There are two possible solution:   take all three task in current Sprint and hope that we will finish it all or plan to take only A and B tasks, and after we will finish them, take task C during Sprint.   It seems, that these two solutions are similar. But, in my opinion, there is a difference. It is motivation.  First solution: it will motivate Team to hurry up. But demotivate, if team will not doing all planned work. By my experience, second case happen more often.  Second solution: I saw, that work usually takes all planned time. And it's not related, how exactly time we allocate to this work. So, if we will plan only two tasks in Sprint, we likely will do this two tasks whole Sprint.  What Scrum say about this? Which way we should use? "
197,Optimizing the phase model of CMS-project,"We are working since couple of years with an CMS.  Until now our working model was divided in the following phases:        Preparation         Online Meetings    Soft Kick off-online    Scoping Workshop   Concepting   Summarization     Output: Proposal       Realisation         Installation/Hosting   Design &amp; Theming     Konfiguration     Programming     Quality Assurance    Training preparation        Training &amp; Testing         Admin-Training    User Acceptance Testing     UAT attendance     Finishing      Go Live         Preparation    Transformation from Test to Live    Acceptance Live-Instance   GO LIVE   Post Go Live attendance         The problem with this model is, that we are strugleling in the most of the time with the projects. In each moment we have misscommunication or lack of resources. Right now we have about 30% work of the preparation and the other 70% are in the last 3 phases. As it seems that is not enough. It is every time the same CMS, just with adapting some changes to fit the customer (as in the configuration, as well in the code).  How to transfer that, so most of the work happens even before the actual realisation of the project? Or even to automate it? It won't bother us, if we make one big preparation and the just fit it to each project. But where to finde guidance for such work to be done?   We have in our team:   back end developer front end developer project manager support team (doing mostly configuration  "
198,How useful are Green Belt techniques in medium/small software projects?,"Background -   I work for a ~100 person sized genetics company that is newly owned by an ~8000+ person corporation. Over the last 2 years I've been our software development project manager and have learned how to do this job and the best practices based purely on experience I've gained here, my own mistakes, books, blogs, webinars, etc. No ""formal"" training; but I have a MS in Biochem so for whatever reason I was seen as a good fit for this role.  Recently we've had a couple of our staff members (laboratory staff not part of a PM dept) attend a 2-week corporate sponsored green belt training program for their own personal development. Now these folks have returned and they have a project to complete and have all these green belt tools ready to use. One of the projects is focused on our in-house lab software that is really quite a small change. If I were gathering requirements I would not plan on taking more than 1 month. However, through the use of the DMAIC model, my colleague has managed to make this small software change take 4 months and countless meetings, and we're only just starting the Analyze step. I'm sitting back, watching this happen and just baffled about the seemingly convoluted process. (Not to mention I'm somewhat...confused about why someone else is doing my job.)  So the crux of my question is - Can anyone speak to the utility of green belt techniques for small or medium sized software projects? Based on my experience and common sense this seems like a much too powerful tool for the project at hand. But without any real experience with green belt training myself, and only a couple years of software PM experience, I'm apprehensive to say 'THIS IS GARBAGE!!' to my senior management (who of course thinks green belt is great because corporate does it.)  Thoughts? "

Client and server side is a usual separation. GUI guys are not too familiar the server side code and vice versa. Should the GUI guys estimate server side stories?  I know that specialization is more or less against Scrum but we've just started using it. "
200,"Which role among these are suitable for ""Administrator"" in Agile Software Development Projects?","I did some research in DSDM and Agile Projects and got stuck in this scenario. I'm new to this so please help me out.  Suppose, in an organisation there are following posts:  1) Managing Director  2) Finance Manager  3) Analysts  4) Administrator  Admin has been with company since its formation and has in-depth knowledge of all aspects of company's business. He handles record keeping and client relations and wants efficient system.  5) Programmers   etc  Now, they hire a software development consultancy for upgrading their current system which uses static webpage, excel for storing data etc. The consultancy has facilitated workshops and will carry out Agile Development project. The posts i listed above wants to be involved in the project where they will have a new role.  Now my question is, will administrator be best suited to the role of Workshop Facilitator? I don't think so because workshop facilitator should be from outside the organisation to ensure neutrality right?  If not, which role will be best suited for administrator?  1) Business sponsor?  I don't think administrator can make financial decisions and must be for a high position right?  2) Business Visionary?  3) Project manager? Anyone with proper skills and knowledge in organisation can play this role right? Could it be admin?  4) Technical coordinator I doubt if Administrator is skilled in technical field? or is he?  5) Business Ambassador Administrator deals with client. Could he play this role?  6)Business Analyst?  7)Business Advisor?  8)Atern Coach?  So, which role would be most suitable for Administrator? "
201,Can 'QA approved' count towards your team's definition of done?,"I'm a ScrumMaster running a development team using scrum. We are working in 3 week sprints and at the end of the sprint we often do not release our code to production right away. It could be a number of weeks before the PO passes the code in UAT and sets a deployment date.  In order to count the 'done' story points and calculate velocity the team has been counting anything 'QA approved' as 'done'because the development work is completed.   Has anyone worked in a similar way, or believe this is the wrong way to count our completed effort?  Any advice on how we should measure progress and 'done'?  Much appreciated! "
202,Role of a project manager,"At my work we have a single project manager on site. We have several concurrently running projects split between a couple of dozen developers, and we also have several developer teams overseas who work on the same projects. Each project involves several cross-functional areas within our office, as well as cooperation with the overseas teams and several third party suppliers.  From what (admittedly little) I've read up online about the role of a Project Manager, it seems to me that they are meant to coordinate the project across teams, work to remove blockages, identify and act on risks.  It seems to me though, that our project manager only has a vague technical understanding of what we're doing and the cross-team collaboration, including pushing other teams to meet deadlines, often falls to me (I'm a team leader). He keeps track of our tasks at a very high level: we break down the project into tasks with estimates, we update our progress regularly, and he aggregates this information onto a graph. It does not seem to me that he understands what each task is. When he talks to us about these tasks it is basically a ""how much time do you have left on this task"" sort of conversation. And he just takes our word on it (which is fine with me, but possibly a problem when you just take the word of an overseas site that wants to make their figures look good).  There is no concept of linking our developer tasks to what QA is doing. While we try to push for agile within our team, QA follows a waterfall model, and starts after our feature work is done.  The act of working out potential bottlenecks, and coordinating cross-site tasks that are inter-related falls to us. We (developers) often have to push third party vendors or overseas sites for delivery dates. I think we're doing a good job at that, but to be honest I'm a technical person and I would rather be doing more technical work and focusing on my own team rather than looking at project spreadsheets, writing emails and having phone calls about other people's deadlines.  I feel like I should raise this with my management, or push back a bit when they ask me to do certain things, but I'm just not entirely sure whether my assumptions about what a project manager is meant to do are right. I haven't worked in very many software organisations, so I'm still relatively new to the org structure of a mid-sized company.  Any advice? Or maybe someone can point me to some page that outlines the different roles within a typical company clearly? "
203,How should a drastic deviation in overall design be managed in Scrum?,"We are starting a Sprint today, first day of a 3-week Sprint. Our requirements from the client are still evolving, so remaining hours are estimated on some unclear values.  How should a deviation in overall design be managed in Scrum? For example, a requirement covered in this Sprint changes drastically, causing the Sprint to land up days behind schedule. Are we still committed to all the work, or do Sprint items get moved out to accommodate the change? "
204,How to implement Scrum method in a 2-individuals team?,"I'm a software developer and I have this project I am working on with a student (an internship). I don't know how to organize the tasks and how to assign them. At first, it was clear. But now we have a lot of work on this project and we lack a lot of organization.  We are working on 3 modules in an Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) project (Odoo 10).  What is the best way to work with a small team of 2 individuals?  How to implement Scrum methods in our project?  How to manage tasks and bugs that take more than the expected time? "
205,"Is it bad, if events took much less time than Scrum Guide prescribes?","The question opposite to this and this one.  Sometime Scrum events may took much less time than Scrum Guide prescribes. Is it a signal, that we did something wrong?  As usual, there is my thoughts on this topic for some clarification:   Daily Scrum. I think this is ok, if that event take less then 15 minutes. It's depend on team size. Smaller team - less time. Sprint Planning. As I said in this question, in the beginning of projects (when Product Backlog is not yet refined well) this event took much more time for our team. But then (especially toward the end of projects) we spend much less time for planning, than Scrum Guide prescribes. Should it be a problem for us? Sprint Review. My team never spent less time for that event, than Scrum Guide prescribe. But if it will happen, what it can signal about? Sprint Retrospective. The same as Sprint Review. We always have what discuss with my team. But if it will happen, what it can signal about?   About Product Backlog refinement. The same as Sprint Planning. It took more than 10 percent of team capacity (I guess. I never calculated it exactly) in the beginning of projects and less in the ending. Is this ok? "
206,How to calculate Critical Path including Std Dev for each activity estimate?,"When estimating activity durations, you get a duration plus/minus a sigma (standard deviation) for each activity.    Afterwards, when you want to determine the critical path, what figure should you use for the duration of each activity?    Or, how should you include the plus/minus of the standard deviation in the activity duration? "
207,How to timebox Spikes using story points?,"My original question was raised here: In Scrum, how to estimate research stories? and as suggested by @CodeGnome I created a separate question.  In my opinion Spikes should be time-boxed as there is often a lure for ""additional 5 minutes"" that programmer thinks are enough to complete the research.  So my concern is: how do you timebox spikes using story points? The concept behind story points I know is that they should not be related to time, rather mix of effort and task complexity.  (side note: I believe that once you start using story points to hours conversion then you'd better start using hours. You will save some time of your team doing the math on planning meeting)  So, how should I handle it? "

Role Requirements:   Manage several Business Systems' Web, Database and Cloud Projects Previous Software or Web-Based PM Experience Previous Agile Development Experience Previous SDLC Experience Cross-Functional Communication (Technical/Dev. Teams and Operations) Experience with Technical Software   The PM does not write code in this position.  Others have told me that this is a traditional ""Software Development Project Manager"" role. If this role is specifically managing software development projects for business systems, how would you write the title? "
209,"How can we improve the situation of a technical team, without a CTO?","Our company runs an online photo sharing application, letting users edit pictures, create slideshows, share them on blogs and social networks and so on. The company is small, roughly 15 people, with a technical staff of 5, 3 seniors and 2 interns, with another intern coming soon. Our CEO is also the head of the marketing team.  We had a CTO until August 2009. When our CTO left, the company was having financial issues, and it was decided not to hire another CTO immediately. The technical staff (only the 3 seniors at the time) decided, between them, what to do.  Without a CTO, we have trouble getting some decisions to be taken by the CEO. This has created some issues on technical level, like quality problems in the infrastructure and code base.  My question is: how do we improve this situation? Should we insist on hiring another CTO which would have a hard time integrating and gaining legitimacy (I designed and created the whole server application. I will not let anybody explain to me how I have to do my job)? "
210,Scrum and TFS assignments,"We're using TFS (2012) as our task tracking system for our Scrum project. In TFS, we have User Stories, and off each story, we have 1 or more tasks. A user story in our case is something like:     As a user, I need to be able to log into the system, to enable me to   use functions assigned to my role.   A task is assigned to a developer, but, within TFS, who should the user story be assigned to? I don't think it's the developer, as numerous developers can be working on the same user story, but assigned the tasks. At the moment, we're assigning to me, project lead. Is that good practice, or is there a better way. Leave it unassigned maybe? "
211,Planning in MS Project: fixed work AND fixed duration,"I currently plan a quite complex project in MS Project. At the moment I cannot plan everything out in detail, but I think that in my head I have a good understanding of how long a task will last and how much manpower will need to go into it.   Now I would like to shift my resources back and forth to see how everything works out. For this I would like to have an overview about how loaded my resources are, but also see whether a task is understaffed. Since not all resources are on board yet, this is especially important for me to understand which qualifications I still need to hire.  MS Project only allows for fixed duration OR fixed work. Now whenever I shift a resource, I either change the amount of work or the duration of the task, depending what is fixed.   Is there a possibility to fix both at the same time? Or some other feature/method in MS Project that gives me the information that I need? "
212,Should story points be strictly relative?,"If we size our stories along the Fibonacci scale (1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13) should we expect that we could complete approximately four 2-point stories in the same time as an 8-point? or thirteen 1-point stories in the same time as a 13-point story? "
213,How to mentor a newbie tester when I lack relevant experience?,"I have been working as a developer in software industry for the past 8 years. I have seen many projects and worked as a dev lead which also involves interacting with QA team to get the testing done of the project I am working on and follow the process of providing releases to QA, fixing defects (defect life cycle) etc. But I have never got a chance to see how a tester work in terms of preparing test plans, testing cycles, test cases etc.  Now, I am leading a very small team where there is no separate lead/supervisor for testing team. Since its a small team, there is only one manual tester who happens to be a fresher from college. I have to mentor him, and I really want him to learn and get a good base for himself. The problem is, I myself do not know much about that domain. I do not want him to suffer because of it.   Can you help me know how to mentor in such scenario? How can I help him learn and grow? "

( Preparing the environment or preparing the documents first )  what are the documents that should I prepare? ( I read about PID Project Initiation Document, FSD, BRD and User Guide etc...) Its a good idea to create a blog and website before starting or its time consuming ( or it can be done later). some software that may help   Some clarifications:   My Project is about developing Web Based Open Source ERP System I have no real client currently ( so I have no specific requirement for a customer, but of course I defined my project requirements ) Since its Open Source is there any extra steps should I consider ? ( community, licencing ? ) I have an idea about Project Life Cycles, but in reality how can I implement it.

215,Human resources in (easy)redmine and automatic representation of their holidays in Gantt,Can I do the following in (easy)redmine and what plugins would I need?  Step 1: Create Human resources and set holidays for them  Step 2: Create tasks with a start and duration and assign them to resources  Step 3: Connect the different tasks  Expected result: When I move a task to a duration that has a resource holiday in it the task should be adjusted in length  I actually can't work out how to do this. I don't know if I am special but I think this would be the basic functionality for a project planning tool. Why would I use a software at all if I need to check holidays by hand for all dependendant tasks when moving/changing one of the earlier ones? 
216,Internal Competition vs Collaboration,Suppose you are a senior executive designing an organization that owns multiple brands in an industry. You can either structure the business unit to have each brand compete or collaborate.  How do you decide which philosophy to adopt? Does it depend on the size of the organization? The degree of separation between the brands? The profitability of the industry? 
217,Microsoft Project for Agile software development?,"I am getting to grips with MS Project 2013. But I wonder if it is usable for Agile software development? So far it seems to be quite useful for setting up an initial plan, for creating offers, calculating costs and for calculating delivery dates.  But what happens when the project is actually in progress?   The Waterfall model is long outdated. Software today is being developed in cycles. You are planning these cycles and achieving milestones but while these are developed you are collecting Bug and feature requests from the users and you need to adapt to sudden changes, unexpected events and software failures etc. So new tasks will constantly arise during the project, existing tasks will change and actual work time will be different.  Can MS-Project be usefully used for constantly adapting to modifications of a ""live"" project? Can it be used for project management, as well as tracking activity and collecting bug and feature requests? "

219,Project governance and scrum. Compatible? Differences?,I just started to learn the ropes of Project Management. While doing so I was confronted with the concept of Project governance. As I like the concept of scrum I was somehow reminded of the scrum master. As far as I understand I would put the project governance on a higher level than the scrum master (more or less a scrum master of the scrum master and his team).   Is this understanding reasonable? As I do not think this is a proper description: Is there a more accurate way to describe this relation?  Are these two concepts compatible at all? Or do they exclude each other? What are your experiences? What are the main differences and similarities?     EDIT  Thank you for the fast replies. In the meantime I also did some further research and found an interesting article. I think I have a better understanding how project governance and scrum work together now. Further contributions are welcome.   
220,Can Scrum Sprint duration change from 4 weeks to 2 weeks during the project?,"Does it makes sense to adjust Sprint duration during the project? Consider a 10 months project for a web portal, requirements are a little obscure right now, so I expect that at the beginning (first and maybe second month) there will be much more analysis and background/infrastructure implementation than following months. So does it make sense to start first two sprint of 4 weeks and then shorten them to 2 weeks when development speed will raise and will be possible to deliver quickly portal functionality?   Thanks "
221,Microsoft Project 2010 - Need Project Design Advice,"I'm designing an IT project sheet for my department. I have a certain methodology in mind, but i'm trying to translate it into Project's configuration.  Here's what I'd like to do:   I want to set max untis for each resource in my department to a % of their 8 hour day (i.e. 40% of 8 hours each day for projects, or 3.2hrs / day) Then I want to manually estimate the amount of time a task will take to complete (backup accounting data - 8 hours) Then I want to assign a resource to a task, and based on the estimated amount of time for that task relative to the max units (hours/day) the assigned resource can spend on that task, I want project to auto-adjust the duration and the start/finish times   I was under the impression that I could accomplish this by setting:   Project Work Times - m-f 8a-12p &amp; 1p-5p (8 hours/day, 5 days a week) Default Task Type - Fixed Work Max units for resource - 20% Manually set 'Work"" column to estimated hours for task Assign resource to task Then 'Duration' &amp; 'Start/Finish' columns should auto-adjust based on preset criteria   For whatever reason this seems to not be working, or possibly working in a way i'm not understanding.  For example, I indicated a task would take 8 hours, and I assigned a resource to it with max untis 40% (3.2 hours / day), but for that specific task assigned the resource's 'Units' at 100% (i.e. I want this resource to spend 100% of their 3.2 hrs/day on this task alone), and yet the duration column states 1 day, and the start/finish columns both have the same day.  Given my assumptions, I would expect the 8 hour task to be broken up into 3.2 hour increments per day based on max units% for the resource, so the duration should be 2.5 business days (8 divided by 3.2 = 2.5) and start finish should reflect that based on the defined project work week.  Does anyone know what/how I need to configure my project to accomplish this? What am I missing? "
222,"Resource Availability, Max Units - Relationship between settings","I am helping a colleague ""debug"" an MS-Project project plan today, where there seem to be unexplained over-allocations. They have chosen quite a complex method for restricting allocations and I don't quite understand what I am seeing.  The units that are allocated to a task, for any particular resource, seem to be governed by settings in three places:   The Resource Availability in the resource calendar The Resource Max Units in the resource sheet The max units allocation on the task   I don't understand the relationship between these settings and so I cannot determine what this colleague is actually forcing Project to do.  If Monday is a fully working day, with a default of 8 hours for Resource A. If I then set their availability via the calendar to 50% I assume that they can only spend 4 hours on the project on that day.  If I then set their Max Units on the Resource Sheet to 50%, does that mean they will only spend 2 hours per day (i.e. 50% of their availability, 50% of 4 hours)?  If I then allocate them to a task at 50% does that provide them with 2 hours availability on the task (i.e. 50% matches their max units from the Resource Sheet and so is allowed) or does it provide 1 hour, being 50% of the availability I have inherited from the Resource Sheet/Calendar combination?  In the past I always have 100% resource availability within time blocks they are on the project, and restrict their availability to tasks within the Resource Allocation. I have no experience of this, apparently 3-layer, description of a Resource's task-hours allocation.  It is driving me nuts! What is the relationship between these settings? "
223,How to handle 'ilities' (or non-functional requirements) for a project planning/prioritization/work-allocation?,"It seems the world is doing a good job at managing functional requirements for a system - you can link them to benefits, prioritize them and manage their implementation schedule (let's assume an ideal world :)  Now consider 'ilities' like modifiability, usability, adaptability, reusability, security, reliability, availability etc., etc.,  Technically one can link them to potential end benefits and also prioritize their importance for a business - but just HOW should one manage their implementation? Assuming you prioritize the functions and the ilities in the same 'pile' so to speak, it's possible that availability may be lower than 'booking tickets' feature-set (for example).  Agilists may argue that the design should reveal itself and that they can 'refactor' availability or security etc., later. Honestly, everything can be added to the system by refactoring but the costs may be prohibitive and that's why one must spend some time (may be more) upfront when accounting for such ilities IMO.  So my question is this: should you preform a separate prioritization for ilities? Should they be in a separate 'pile' (or backlog) of their own? What should be a good sequencing order when implementing the system? If you indeed perform two independent prioritization activities then how can you compare amongst them and convince the stakeholders that you are indeed doing valuable things first? Basically how would you justify doing ility-management/planning/design over feature-set designing?  Since ilities have tradeoffs associated with them you must be able to balance them well and thinking about it later or following YAGNI (You ain't gonna need it) won't suffice. What do you suggest? "

Lets assume that we have finished development sprints, internal tests (analysts &amp; developers) are over. Application is deployed on test environment for user acceptance tests. Those tests are covered by business users of the application.  What should we do now?   Do something else waiting for users bugs for the next sprint? Plan the sprint for period of time without any issues and solve the bugs as they come? Start the next sprint, what to do with bugs that are coming?  "
227,"As a PM, How do you select your project team members?","I’m new to project management and it’s not a fulltime job; in other words a programmer turned project manager, still do some coding :-)  I was following this site’s proposal from the beginning, and posted few example questions .  This one question was important to me.  Is the team select skill only gained from experience? Or will there is other ways to select right person for right task?  Normally I will get a resource pool, from graduate interns to highly skilled and experienced programmers. Sometime we have to manage the resource crunch with low experienced persons.  My take on team selection - There will be at least one person who can do the task correctly and within time, success of PM is to find that right person.  I would like to hear from experienced persons, how they select their team. I guess, team selection has been described in every PM book; especially my favourite “Software Project Survival Guide” &amp; “Mythical Man Month”. "
228,Switching from a R&D to program/project management after a PhD,"I began my career as a control systems engineer for petro/oil/chemical/cement plants (handled everything from meeting the customer in the field, gathering input, setting up meetings with different module owners to get buy-in, design, dev, testing and handing over the final system to the customer).   Then I switched to signal processing and got an MS and PhD in video compression. I've been working as an R&amp;D engineer for > 2 years been handling large feature requests each taking close to 2 months (again - gather requests from product managers, design, develop, reviews, unit tests, integration, coordinate with QA, bug reports, etc). Though we are head-quartered in NY, our team is spread around the world and I coordinate daily with several teams to get my work through.  I am considering shifting to a program/product manager role and I would like some advice with this. I enjoy innovating and coming up with solution to tough engineering problems, and I often find myself drawn into big-picture discussions and volunteering my opinions on product plans while talking to managers.   My company doesn't have any PM/TPM roles (only Senior Engr., Staff Engr. Principal Engr., Manager, Director, VP, etc.) - so my search will most likely have to be outwards.   I am looking into firms in other domains too - problem is that I am mostly a C, C++, MATLAB, scripting (bash, python) sorta engineer with lots of experience in Agile methodologies and tools that a CS company should be using (version control, bug reporting, code inspection, profiling, etc.). Apart from my writing my own websites in HTML and CSS/ or using Wordpress (with some PHP coding), I have very little experience in mobile technologies or the web stack.  How do I make this switch? Do I need to get a certification first? Any suggestion will help me greatly. Thanks!  Sorry if this question has been asked before!  "
229,How should I deal with changing points of contact on a Project (client side)?,"The point of contact (say, Dave) on a large project has now informed me that due to the overwhelming quantity of work, he has now authorized a new point of contact (Let's call her Sally). The difficulty is that he wishes to be the final decision maker and Sally is just the channel for information that is to be relayed to our team from their side.  Question: Should I ask Dave to reconsider and continue to the single point of contact? Or should I deal with Sally and cc Dave on every piece of communication? Likewise, if I am to receive any approvals from Sally, should I assume that it has already been authorized by Dave?  How should I deal with a contact change (but same final decision maker)? "
230,How to convince an employer you're worth more than you're being paid,"Perhaps not the best wording of a question title, but it more or less sums up what I'm trying to ask. Basically, say you work for a company and do x, y and z to improve various aspects of the company; but after a period of time and an acquisition of standard pay rises, what if you feeling you are being underpaid for your work? My question is: how would you convince your employer that you are, indeed, being underpaid; and what would a project manager or employer be looking for in your approach to the topic? "
231,Is alignment of scrum retrospectives with Change Management possible?,"Given a case where an organization has both dozens of scrum teams and a global Change Management program, does it make sense to feed information available through the Scrum Retrospectives to the Change Management process?  In terms, if there are external impediments which are outside of scrum team power to work around meaningfully, Change Management [""a program dedicated to managing organisational change and supporting staff to deal with changes in the business""] could help, right? "
232,How to integrate a remote person in a Scrum team?,We have hired a new team member who lives in another country.  This is not like a team split across 2 locations - he is alone there. What things should we consider doing in such a case:   in order to keep our daily standups short. to help him visualize our physical Scrum board. to make him participate in our review/retro/planning meetings.   Does anyone have experience with this kind of situation and can you recommend any Do's and Dont's? Is it unrealistic to try to involve him in the Scrum process? 
233,How to measure bug incidence in Production?,"We have a fully automated deploy process but as we now sometimes we break things.  When this happens the developer just apply a hot fix in (branch, fix and opens a PR) the trunk development. As you could imagine in this situation we lost the bug incidence metric.  So at the moment we are not capable of see if we are fixing too many bugs instead of delivering new features.  What is a good practice to avoid loosing bug incidence tracking?  One of the options is to link Jira (Issue tracking tool) with Git hub. So to deploy software to production we must have a opened ticket on Jira.  So how do u guys manage those kind of metrics? Do u just rely on process and advocate users to create bug/issues? "
234,MS Project 2010 - Create project from a set of variables,"Being new to MS Project, I am wondering if I can create a project based on a defined template modified by some variables.  I am dealing with several (20+) projects I have to manage parallel. The projects themselves are almost identical in structure, i.e. they all have six sequential work packages that have a defined ratio of effort (e.g package 1 is 45% of the total project effort, package 2 is 5% and so on). They basically only differ in the following variables:   Start date End date Total hours available Assignment of the six fixed, sequential work packages to authors (aka resources)   Is it possible in MS Project to define a project template and generate a project plan just from entering the variables listed above and have the rest (like start/end dates and hours for the individual work packages) be filled in automatically? If so, how? "
235,When and how to schedule effective meetings?,"I'm the lead programmer turned project manager in a small shop. Our project has entered ""the last 90%"" phase where many things need to be communicated between different departments. This means many more meetings than during the initial development phase. Most of these spring up as impromptu meetings whenever the CEO feels the need to communicate something, which is usually when I'm trying to concentrate on something entirely different and am least prepared for them. These meetings are less effective than they could be and they eat into my productivity.  What's a good rule of thumb to schedule meetings? Is it better to stick to rigidly scheduled meetings every day or week, even when there's nothing to say, or should meetings be scheduled with an advance notice whenever there is something to say? How do you suppress non-time-critical impromptu meetings, especially when they come from above? "
236,How do all the PM frameworks and methodologies relate to each other?,"I would love to see a succinct and clear description of how all the different project management approaches, methodologies and frameworks relate to each other, what they share and what is different between them.   How would one go about situating approaches like PMBOK, Prince2, CMMI, TSP, Agile, Lean, XP, Scrum, Kanban in relation to each other?  I'm thinking of something that is an attempt at a taxonomy of all the different approaches with approaches grouped into sets of defining characteristics.  Possible splits would be between Waterfall/Agile and between Formal Methodology/Flexible Framework   A diagram, if it is possible, showing these relationship would be even better.  Is this something that has ever been attempted? And if so where would one find it? "
237,Activity on Arrow diagram: simplification allowed when sequence is predecessor of next node,"I have to make an AOA diagram in which the following situation occurs:  +---+----------------+--------------+ | # |  Description   | Predecessors | +---+----------------+--------------+ | C | Welding        | B            | | D | Removing slack | C            | | E | Filling tank   | C, D         | +---+----------------+--------------+   Since C is a predecessor of both D and E, but E is also dependant on D, can I simplify the diagram to just a sequence of C->D->E ? If not, would the diagram be as following:    Or am I allowed to simplify in this case, so the result is as following:   To me it seems weird both to have a node with just two incoming dummies, but also to just to fully drop a predecessor relationship like nothing happened. Am I missing something? "
238,Can someone explain the Requirements Traceability Matrix purpose?,"So I was taking a sample scope management test online, and Question #9 stumped me -- the question on the traceability matrix. Can someone please explain why b is better than c?  Below is the direct question, quoted from the PMP Den Exam Question 3 website:     Which of the following BEST describes the purpose of a traceability matrix?      A) It describes how WBS Dictionary entries are traced to work packages, and how work packages are decomposed from deliverables      B) It’s used to make sure that all of the sub-plans of the Project Management Plan have been created      C) It helps you understand the source of each requirement, and how that requirement was verified in a later deliverable      D) It’s used to trace the source of every change, so that you can keep track of them through the entire Control Scope process and verify that the change was properly implemented   Here is their explanation for the right answer:     (b) The Requirements Traceability Matrix is a tool that you use to trace each requirement back to a specific business case, and then forward to the rest of the scope deliverables (like specific WBS work packages), as well as other parts of the project: the product design (like specific levels in Cows Gone Wild) or test strategy (like test plans that the Ranch Hand Games testers use to make sure that the game works).""   I'm not sure I understand. Can someone explain in greater detail? "
239,OneNote as an enterprise wiki?,"I like wikis for knowledge gathering / sharing but the usability of many of them could be better in my opinion (for example, MediaWiki is popular but has quite complicated and verbose syntax which can put some people off).  OneNote, on the other hand, is fairly easy to use and also can be viewed as a kind of wiki. However, I have only experience with OneNote as a single user on a local PC. I'm not sure about these things:   Is there a version history stored for every page? Can I do diffs between revisions? Can OneNote ""wiki"" be hosted as an intranet website, i.e. something like a self-hosted OneNote Web Application? Or are Microsoft services like Office 365 or SkyDrive the only ways to view OneNote pages in the browser? Can OneNote pages have their URLs I could link to?   In general, do you think it is viable to use OneNote as an enterprise wiki? What advantages and disadvantages will it have? "
240,What should Scrum Master do if Scrum Team hasn't reached an event goal after time-box expires?,"What should the Scrum Master do if the time-box of event has already expired, but the goal not reached yet?  This is the quote that made me think about this question:     So what do we do when the time-boxed sprint planning meeting is nearing the end and there is no sign of a sprint goal or sprint backlog? Do we just cut it short??? Or do we extend it for an hour? Or do we end the meeting and continue the next day?      This happens over and over, especially for new teams. So what do you do? I don’t know. But what do we do? Oh, um, well, usually I brutally cut the meeting short. End it. Let the sprint suffer. More specifically, I tell the team and product owner “so, this meeting ends in 10 minutes. We don’t have much of a sprint plan really. Should we make do with what we have, or should we schedule another 4-hour sprint planning meeting tomorrow from 8 am?”. You can guess what they will answer... :o)      I’ve tried letting the meeting drag on. That usually doesn’t accomplish anything, because people are tired. If they haven’t produced a decent sprint plan in 2 – 8 hours (or however long your time-box is), they probably won’t manage it given another hour. The next option is actually quite OK, to schedule a new meeting next day. Except that people usually are impatient and want to get going with the sprint, and not spend another bunch of hours planning.       So I cut it short. And yes, the sprint suffers. The upside, however, is that the team has learned a very valuable lesson, and the next sprint planning meeting will be much more efficient. In addition, people will be less resistant when you propose a meeting length that they previously would have thought was too long.      Scrum and XP from the Trenches. How we do Scrum. By Henrik Kniberg.   In reality, I think, there are only two possible solutions: To add some time to event or just interrupt it.  These are my ideas and what I did in my practice (my solutions may be wrong, that's why I asked this question):   Daily Scrum. In really, I never had problems with time-box limit of Daily Scrum. But I have no objections to interrupt this event after 15 minutes. Sprint Planning. All that Henrik Kniberg wrote makes sense. But in my practice, I always just add some additional time. This problem happened very rare in my practice (but nevertheless has happened). It happened at the beginning of projects when Product Backlog is not yet well-refined. Much more often we spend much less time than Scrum Guide prescribes (which may be not good either, but that is another question). Sprint Review. This problem happens with me during Sprint Review more often than during Sprint Planning. Interrupt it and make new session on next day? No, thanks. It will be a painful to gather all stakeholders on unusual day. Don't make new session at all? It may harm next Sprint. So, I always added some additional time, if time-box is not enough. If it is not right decision, please correct me. Sprint Retrospective. As in a case of Daily Scrum, I have no objections to interrupting this event if time-box is expired.   About Product Backlog refinement: In reality, I never calculated exactly what percentage of capacity it took. But I think there is nothing terrible about it being more than 10 percent, especially toward the beginning of the project. "
241,Can you make a custom timeline?,"Can you make  a custom timeline by corporate periods? or add the periods over the dates?  Our company refers to time in Periods where each period has 4 weeks. Is it possible to remove the dates or add the period distinction maybe above the timeline?  Thanks, Lori "
242,When should I use a contract Scrum Master?,"Lately we've been looking at growing our organisation, and I've been looking at the possibility of either getting a contract Scrum Master to help us grow, hiring a new full-time Scrum Master or training someone internally.  What I'm curious to know is when is it better to get a contract Scrum Master on board, and when is it best to try and train or hire a full time Scrum Master? Does anyone have experience with this? Is there a rule of thumb I should follow to decide when a contractor or internal Scrum Master would be better? "
243,Professional PM skills without classes?,"How possible is it to learn the skills of project management without actually taking any classes on it? I'm definitely up for pouring through books and applying what I learn to my own projects so I can manage them and learn through experience, but right now taking classes is out of the question.  How can I go about getting the same knowledge? "
244,How do you address the fear of control loss from Agile adoption,"According to this survey, the most common concern about Agile adoption is a loss of management control.  What are the different arguments one can bring to address this specific concern? How do you help the management trust Agile process and give up this control they like to have on their teams? "
245,How to Avoid Micro-Managing a Software Development Team?,"I've managed a few projects over the last few years, and one of the biggest challenges I face is avoiding becoming a micro-manager.  I worked with a team once where I worked with a group of software engineers, and I was in the PM role.    When I communicate with the marketing team, or the design team, I find it much easier to trust their opinions and estimates than when dealing with the engineers on my team, mainly because I have worked as a software developer and have pretty strong opinions on what is the correct answer and what is incorrect.  Looking back, sometimes I think that the decisions could have been a matter of opinion.  With the engineering team, I find we oftentimes get into debates about right and wrong, and I wonder if I'm crossing the line into micro-managing the project.   What situations have you been in when you've fallen into the trap of becoming a micro-manager? How can one tell if he/she is micro-managing a project other than someone coming out and saying it?   What are some strategies that you've used to avoid becoming a micro-manager?  "
246,How to manage and motivate external workers in project?,In one of projects I work we have some people working only partially. They come to work only when there is a need for their work in project and sometimes they work at home.  The problem is with commitment - when they are not part of the team they aren't motivated. When they work at home it's hard to get output from them.   What you recommend? How to make them participate more in the project?  How to deal with remote workers not doing their work on time? 
247,How to organize a 6-month project plan for agile?,"We have a charter to build a product in 6 months. I'll preface this by saying that my manager wants us to use waterfall, even though our development process is agile.   With that said, I have been asked to create a 6 month project plan that outlines milestone dates and a list of tasks &amp; dates to monitor project progress. I've never done a detailed project plan for more than 2 months in Agile, so I need everyone's help :)  My thoughts:  Approach 1: List out all the project tasks and use guesstimates on work effort per task and present a linear path to completion. This is obviously risky since our estimates can be completely off and risk the timeline. I suppose we can de-risk by doubling our estimate #s?  Approach 2: Group tasks into sprints, and follow an 'x' week sprint cadence. Each sprint will have a breakdown of all the tasks we have to do until we get to 6 months. Unfortunately this still suffers risk of missing the deadline if our estimates our off...  Thoughts? "
248,"What's the exact definition of ""Program Manager""?",I'm still confused with the title 'Program Manager' after I went through this site and searched over threads. Actually I haven't seen many 'Program Managers' in practice.      Is it a regular role in PM?   What's its definition and role?     
249,How to integrate Project Managers within an organisation,"We do have around 50 PMs in the organisation and they all manage different projects; for different clients; different technologies, different teams. So they are a bit isolated from each other. The integration is quite good within a team, but not as good between PMs. I wonder how to integrate them. Not only to have a beer together, but also to encourage knowledge transfer between the projects. If one PM finds out a great solution to a problem, I would like other PMs to at least know about it... or maybe use the solution if they have a similar problem.   One thing I can think of now is kind of a ""Project Open Day"". So everyone is invited to come, have a beer and ask ""how do you manage this?"", ""How do you manage that?"".  So my intentions are:   social aspects oriented knowledge transfer oriented   Do you have your favorites way to achieve this? "
250,How should I control a programming project's progress?,"We have a startup and it is our first experience. We want to create a mobile application and its website implementation.  We have 3 main parts:   Mobile application Website application A server that can work with both of them   We are 4 people and one extra man can be added if needed. 2 people will work on the mobile app and 2 will work on the website, the server and graphic designs.  My question is: How can I manage this team to work parallel together? I mean how to control work progress? How long should the deadlines be?  Let's consider we want to create a UI for Android and I think it takes 5 days. Can I say ""Jack, go to your home and write this part of the project and I'll meet you next week with Android UI?""? Or must I break it up into 5 mini-projects (first day: design layers, second day: write menus, third day: write tabs, etc.) and say ""Come here everyday and we can check the work progress together.""?  Sorry if they are stupid questions, but maybe you had them in your first project! "
251,How to work with freelancers in a proper way?,"Note: At first I wrongly posted this question to the original Stackoverflow site  Let's say that for a software project I have:    a complete project plan; a software requirements specification; a software architecture document; a lead developer; and (me as a project manager).   I need to hire 1-4 freelance developers to get different parts of the project done.  My plan is to use odesk, elance, etc. to find the needed workers. Then I will set up Redmine or JIRA to organize the workflow (tickets, deadlines, etc.). I am also going to introduce daily email reports on what has been done so far (required from each worker). I will use escrow for payments to these freelancers. I am not going to hire the cheapest freelancers.  But before I do that, I would like to know:   are there any special things I need to know and to do before I start working with freelancers? are there any best practices to manage such a distributed team of freelancers effectively? does my overall plan look feasible and realistic? (from your experience).   "

253,Should one give an access to Issues Tracking System to a project sponsor?,"Should a project sponsor have an access to Issues Tracking System (call it a ""bug list"")? If yes, how do you manage a potential conflict between sponsor's expectations of bug-free quality and a list of bugs he/she is seeing? "
254,Using the Stacey matrix to capture agile metrics,"I recently encountered the Stacey matrix in an answer by Stephan Weinhold. After looking at the linked image provided &amp; doing a bit more reading that describes it as a way to characterize complexity, I thought of two specific use cases for agile software projects.  Case 1. Definition of ready &amp; backlog grooming  Part of my definition of ready is ""defined well enough to be scoped."" A story with too much uncertainty, vagueness, or disagreement isn't ready because it is then unlikely to be successfully completed within a sprint.  Thus if we plot our backlog on a Stacey chart, we could use a defined area in the lower leftish as part of the definition of ready. (EDITED to clarify: I'm thinking of a region roughtly the size of the entire lower left quadrant here, not just the lower left corner. I imagine the boundary would be wide, and might well be asymmetric.)  Furthermore, a story's location outside this area indicates what kind of grooming needs to be done in order to get it into the ready state. Items that are vague or not agreed as to ""what"" require mostly stakeholder work to get more clarity or agreement. Items that are uncertain or not agreed as to ""how"" could benefit from more research or an exploratory spike.  Case 2. Complexity metric in place of story points  The best practice for story points, t shirt sizes, or similar relies on having a standard unit story so your team can do relative sizing. But that can be difficult for various reasons.   Since story points have also been described as a measure of complexity, and the Stacey matrix is about measuring complexity, why not define a scalar based on Stacey coordinates instead?  It could be a simple sqrt(x2 + y2), or a less rectilinear version that gives more weight to the ""how"" uncertainty than the ""what"", which is what I'm leaning towards.   So my questions are:  A. Has anyone done anything like this? How has it worked?  B. What problems might arise from this approach, either for case 1 or case 2?  The one thing that concerns me about case 2 (using a Stacey metric instead of story points) is that, although it captures complexity, it doesn't capture size. I'm thinking maybe an INVESTed story is already within a reasonable size range, though?  EDITED TO UPDATE: I've concluded that size needs to be its own metric, and am working with my team to define an objective, similarly ten point scale. I plan to record the three scores separately, and will then play with various combinations to see which seems to be the most consistent across sprints.   Thanks for any comments, feedback, or further reading!  Vicki "
255,How to document and manage activity that is managed by different procedures from different categories (CMMI)?,"CMMI has 4 categories of process areas in staged representation, those categories are:   process management project management engineering support   All the CMMI process areas are categorized in these 4 categories. We can take example - process/activity ""software implementation/coding"". Apparently this activity is controlled by procedures from different process areas from all the 4 categories (e.g. by 'Technical solution', 'Organizational Process Focus', 'Project planning', 'Configuration management'), actually - one can attribute almost any process area to this activity.   How one is supposed to live and work with this? E.g. how one can describe and depict all the process interdependencies for one such activity ""coding""? Does every procedure should refer to almost every activity in the company so that each activity is covered by 4-dimensional grid of CMMI PA categories or even worse by 24-dimensional grid of CMMI process activities (from all the 5 maturity levels)? Or maybe different process areas refer to different abstraction levels of the same activity? I am totally confused...  I need to write quality manyal for CMMI compliant (and agile) organization but no idea how to tackle this grid or network of interdependencies. Sole coding is much more simpler. "
256,How can I tell when I need multiple 'tiers' of management?,"Large projects and enterprises always seem to have various levels of management. There's usually a top committee that runs the overall direction and big-picture of the project, and one or more levels that are concerned with details of a specific part that report back to the 'higher' managers. Smaller projects seem to often get by with one manager who oversees everything.  How can I tell if a project is suited to multiple levels of management, or even if it should grow beyond one manager? Are there any guidelines by numbers, philosophy, project complexity, etc.? What else should I know when deciding if I should partition a project into multiple levels of management? "
257,How to provide traditional upper management early analyses in an agile project?,"I was discussing moving our process to become more agile with our (mostly traditional) Chief Information Officer (CIO).  The CIO's stance was that >=80% of the requirements need to be defined (and set in stone) up-front, before work on the project can begin. Essentially, fixed scope.  I argued that frequent feedback and fixed schedule would result in better products, and would not need such a large percentage of the scope to be fixed at the onset. That when new scope came up, either other scope should be removed or the schedule be renegotiated.  The CIO then posed to me a question which I was unsure how to answer - namely, how to then justify the original project schedule/cost to the CEO at the beginning to the project. The CEO expects gap and cost analyses before a project begins.  I could argue that agile development processes would overall provide more value to the business, but, given the biases involved (on both sides), I don't think that would be sufficient justification to change if the CIO doesn't continue to provide the analyses that the CEO expects.  So, my question:  How can sufficient upfront analysis be done to satisfy a traditional CEO without locking down a project's scope from the beginning, thereby hobbling much of agile's benefits? Is it impossible? Or am I simply on the wrong track here, and I'm missing something? "
258,"In Scrum, are the developers supposed to engage stakeholders at all? Or is it solely the responsibility of the product owner?","In my scrum team, we basically don't have a vision for the product. Our product owner thinks she's writing user stories but they are really just high level epics. Breaking down those 'stories' ends us up with having to interact with dozens of different stakeholders in the business and gathering requirements for something we have no idea what it is!  My concern with doing this, is that stakeholders don't really know what they need. Each of them might give us conflicting information. Then, each of us on the development team might hold conflicting information and all hell breaks lose when we attempt to build the product.  I'm increasingly feeling that it's the sole responsibility of the product owner to engage all the stake holders, aggregate information they give and form a vision for the product; something it seems, is being farmed out to the development team instead.  Is it a good idea for us developers simply refuse to engage stakeholders?  How can a Scrum team encourage the product owner to work with the team in breaking down the user stories? "
259,What can we do for a fragmented team with short projects?,"I'm working in an agency and we are seven employees. Most of the employees have very specific skills. There is one employee for video productions, two for design, one for social network, one for websites, one for general administration and me for web applications. Two of them are bosses.  Because of those different skills, each person can't be replaced by another. We work mostly alone on our projects but we need others sometimes. We are very autonomous in our work and we manage ourselves most of the time.   We are looking for tools to have a clearer vision of our projects. We want to know if someone is busy or not and when task we assign to others will be done. We also need to see when things goes wrong.  I'm reading about Kanban and Scrum. They seems to be focused on larger teams and bigger projects.  What can we do for us, with fragmented team with short projects?  EDIT 19/07/2016  I plan to do two things. First, I want to add a board with two columns. The first column is for problems. A team member can add a title for a problem an his name in the parentheses. Other persons with the same problem will add their name in the parentheses so we know if it's a personal problem or a team problem. The second column is for ideas of solutions. Ideas can be related to a problem. Once a week, we will have a meeting to speak about problems we live and try to find solutions.  The second board in splitted like this :           | Recurring | To Do | In progress | in validation | done | waiting Design  |           |       |             |               |      |        | Video   |           |       |             |               |      |        | Dev Web |           |       |             |               |      |        |   Recurring is for tasks we have to do every day, week, month... waiting is for tasks we have to wait for external event. Other columns are self-explicit.  A task must a title, a priority and velocity. The priority is set by the person who add a tasks and the velocity have to be set by the person in charge. I plan to give a number of magnets (3 or 4) and they can place it on tasks they're working on. If they want to work on something else and they haven't a free magnets, they have to do a tasks before to start another.  What you think? I'm not sure about the ""To Do"" column because a tasks without a magnet is a task to do. Maybe I can find better columns. "
260,What exactly is information change?,"A few companies talk about 'information change' as part of their analytics group, for example here: [website]What does this mean? I have read about change management but I don't think it would be that. Is information change similar to change management, i.e., is it a structured approach to how information is used?   If anyone could give me a clear description of what this is, and how it benefits a business I would appreciate it.  "
261,Project charter diagrams,"What diagrams should be included in a project charter?  In our standard template there is a section for ""Implementation approach and methodology"", this is where the flow diagrams normally are. The project is mainly front end styling related so it doesn't have many flow changes.  Should a charter include use case diagrams? Are they more relevant in a Requirements document? "
262,I need to adapt some kind of system to my work and work of my team,"I work in a small company for 4 years now. My goal was to develop a geographic information system (GIS) website from scratch, which I gradually fulfilled. Today the page is online, with traffic, we are getting offers and challenges what to develop there next, and I have a small team of junior developers.  The problem is that the work is stacking (because our salesman likes to promise everything to everybody) and at the same time I have to coordinate or even teach my team members about the existing system. It's very hard to keep focused on the most complex parts of development, when you hear your name every five minutes.  Does somebody know this pattern? What would you suggest to do? "
263,Why would teams use the Fibonacci sequence for story points?,"Why do some teams use numbers from the Fibonacci sequence as story points? Is it just a preference, or is there something more to it? "
264,How to track milestones shared between several repositories?,"I watched [website]Say we have a feature push that requires tracking issues from both a ""frontend"" &amp; a ""backend"" repository in a single organisation for simplicity sake. How do you collate, prioritize and track progress with Github issues that span several repositories?  Right now, one possible solution requires me to manually synchronize labels across repositories which seems rather tedious and lacks ordering.  Any suggestions here please? I did have a quick look at Zenhub, but that seems again repository bound and it doesn't seem to write back labels if you actually bothered to sort the issues or tasks into backlog/in-progress etc. "
265,How to handle client's unrealistic testing results,"I have an application form on a website to apply for something. It's been tested thoroughly and passes. However my client found that if you entered an emoji in one the fields that does an address search, the form breaks.  And my answer is ""well, yeah."" It's an unreasonable action. No user would actually do this, and I think it's silly the client is coming to me about this. I mean, what do they expect if they do unrealistic things to the form that an ordinary user would not?  How do I handle/deal with this? Do I tell the client that they're being ridiculous, or do I humor them and fix it?  This isn't the first time they've done this. They'll find all sorts of ways to break the website, such as enter this value, then delete and enter this invalid character, then enter a number, then delete and repeat, separate the red sea and move my house 6 inches to the left and you get an error. And I just feel like puling my hair out. What do they expect?  Who's the unreasonable one here? "
266,Who tests what criteria for epics?,"So our product owner is in a position where she feels encumbered by the decomposition of a large user story:    Product owner presents a story Engineers determine that it is too big for a single story Engineers convert it to an epic (or theme) and then write additional user stories (as developers) that we need to complete the epic.   Rather than have the PO write the developer [sub]stories, we write them for ourselves with the understanding that when all of our stories are complete, we will deliver the epic and the acceptance/confirmation will be done on criteria originally written by the PO (the original story that we converted to an epic)   PO's Story (as a admin, I want to blabbity-blah, so that I can blabbity blah) (total 21 points)  Dev Story 1 (8 points)  Dev Story, Task 1 Dev Story, Task 2  Dev Story 2 (13 points)  Dev Story, Task 1 Dev Story, Task 2 etc...     And so on...  This is easier for the PO to manage. She just writes up the story, so she can remain high level with her eye on the bigger picture instead of wasting hours writing additional stories that she has no interest in nor does she understand. The devs are happy because we can break everything up into logical workloads and point them, then task those out to provide a WBS.  Now, the engineering manager is a bit uneasy because he wants each of the dev stories to be tested against some sort of acceptance critieria int the same way the Epic Story will be accepted/tested; as milestones/checkpoints so to speak. We are recommending something more low level in these instances: for instance unit test suites that show everything is passing, and/or QA running SOAPUI tests against new webservices, or other test tools -- but mainly unit test suites for things that don't yet have a front end.  So in short, we're recommending that dev stories are accepted by QA through the results of different kinds of tests. We'll try to keep QA involved with the requirements so they can ask questions during the process and ensure that engineers are keeping the original acceptance criteria in sight. Then we'll have the PO and QA do acceptance on the original story once the Epic is delivered and that will be done against the critieria written on the original story which we converted to an Epic.  So my question is: do you see anything intrinsically wrong with this? How do you approach the testing of epic, etc? "
267,"Is Redmine sufficient for light to moderate project management? If so, what plug-ins are required?","""Redmine is a flexible project management web application. Written using Ruby on Rails framework, it is cross-platform and cross-database.  Redmine is open source and released under the terms of the GNU General Public License v2 (GPL).""   Is it sufficient for what project managers need?  It has issues and tasks, start and end dates, assignees.  It can do GANTT charts.  But I don't know what other Microsoft Project-like features ""real"" project managers use. If so, did you need to add plug-ins to use it?  If so, which? If not, what is it lacking?   I am approaching this as a technical lead of a ~3 person project who has to do some scheduling and status tracking, not as a full project manager.  EDIT 2/16/11: We are already using Redmine, so I'm interested in that solution in particular. "
268,Consultant to review project work plan,"I am responding to a request for proposal (RFP) that is requiring us to provide a Work Breakdown Structure, a deliverable list with details for each deliverable, and a list of resources by role in each phase with their estimated effort.  I really want to make sure I am doing this correctly, as it's a fairly large part of the evaluation scoring, but I am finding there are varying examples of what should be included.    I would like to create my draft plan and work with a project management consultant who can help me improve it and ensure I am covering everything that is being asked.    My question is, where can I find a person to review this?  I obviously did some googling and the only things I found are huge consultant firms that would be overkill for this relatively small review I need.  Do any of you have any ideas where I would look to hire someone to review this? "
269,Scrum on maintenance. Is it possible?,"God bless, I never had a lot of deal with maintenance. But I am curious, is it possible to customize Scrum for maintenance?  If yes, how to guarantee SLA (if developers have a fixed Sprints), for example? Or what Product owner should do? Gather bug reports or something else? "
270,The meaning of & Calculating Project Budget,"I'm very new to the whole Project Management world, so this question may be at the beginners level, anywho:  What is the Budget Cost compared to the full Cost of the Project?, based on the research I have gathered that Budget Cost is the project financial allocations or estimates the project is expected to meet; so am I being told here that the Project Budget is what the Project Manager sets up at the beginning of the project to calculate how much of the full actual of the project price will actually be needed to completion of the project?, if so doesn't this seem a bit close to the EAC (Estimate At Completion) definition? as they are both being estimated..  Moving on, the way that Budget cost is calculated is as follows:  Budget = Opportunity  Value ([tex]) – Value Pricing ($)   Now I have no idea what that means, as in What is a Contingency Value and Value Pricing?, I'm guessing that Opportunity Value is in fact the project cost..  All in all, I really would like to understand what Budget Cost actually means compared to EAC and the Opportunity Cost for example and who is responsible for calculating it? "
271,How are items with dependencies to other items handled in Kanban?,"In our team we are working with system integration testing only. This means that we don't have any development tasks, just testing tasks and tasks related to preparing our heavy systems for test.   We are looking into if Kanban is a good process for us, we think so. But we often have chains of tasks, for instance revert system X to previous version, then upgrade to current version, then backup the system, then perform some test.   Can such chains of tasks be handled in Kanban, and how if so? Is there a way to indicate the relations of those items in the Kanban board? "
272,How to anticipate delays in the project schedule?,"I once managed a very intensive, very complex project that with every tool, illustrated an on-time schedule. But in the end, the project was severely delayed.  I understand the concept of ""known unknowns"", ""unknown unknowns"" and scope creep; but what is the community's guidance on the best way of anticipating the potential of schedule delays?   For instance, I understand the NASA Apollo project was subject to all the above (and more). How did the PMs anticipate delays that could have put them in Jeopardy of missing the Dec 1969 deadline?  "
273,How to deal with clients' resistance to smaller deliveries?,"When I read this question (Dealing with external departments continuous delivery / smaller feature scope), it made me think of our situation at work. The major difference, though, is that the resistance to continuous delivery is mainly coming from our clients.  Context  I work in a small b2b2c company that caters to large online real estate platforms. My role (similar to that of a scrum master) is to help our (cross-functional) dev team become more agile by simplifying/optimizing workflows, facilitating collaboration and learning, and encouraging incremental value creation. We're using a loose kanban framework, but I think this issue would apply even if we were using Scrum or XP (hence the tags). No one on the team has experience with Agile/Lean, but I've seen steady progress in that regard over the last year.  Issue  Strangely enough, the main problem I'm facing as I'm trying to suggest more vertical slicing to create value faster (e.g. releasing one feature in less than a week instead of waiting three to four weeks to release five) and shorten the feedback loop, is that clients would rather we release updates less often. From my understanding, it's because our products are embedded on our their website, so they use the same (slow and heavy) processes that they use for their own website and products, for both QA and marketing purposes.  It seems to me that it would still make sense to ship small increments internally, and then bundle them in a release to our clients, but given the team's lack of experience with Agile practices, they'd rather do the following:   do the ""full flow"" (from design to deployment on our testing server) for one feature for the rest, use vertical slicing, i.e. create one card (task) for data collection, one card for data processing, and so on up until the front-end integration.   The team's point is that given that we can't ship before the full release is done, it's more efficient to do all the processing at once. Since they're not used to Agile practices, this is also more consistent with the way they've always worked.  From my perspective, this adds a lot of pressure to the person at the end of the process (i.e. front-end integration) and it removes flexibility in that if we're running out of time we can't just drop features.  Question  What are good approaches to dealing with these kinds of clients? Even if the client didn't want to change, should I nudge the team to ship smaller increments internally? "
274,How much management is needed for medium sized IT company?,"I am a software dev in a medium size company. We work with a few people remotely (in a different EU country). We used to have the following people:   1 CTO 2 agile coaches (1 of them being a PO as well which I think it's excessive for an agile company of this size) 1 architect (non hands-on) 1 Scrum master 1 PO (additional to the PO - coached?) 6 devs 3 testers 2 devops   Now, after some changes we have:   1 CTO 1 PO of POs (accross 2 teams) 1 PO (for the team I am working on) 1 scrum master 1 scrum master (remote) 1 developers manager (line)   and the same amount of hands on people   6 devs 3 testers 2 devops   The questions are:   Isn't management a bit too much? How much management would such a formation need? Here there are factors such as, there are more than 1 teams in the company (with their respective managers) but CTO, lead PO and Line manager are across all teams.   By the way, we haven't ship anything for almost 1 year now, though it seems like something is about to happen.  EDIT: So, as an amusing update to this, the CTO of the company has left... "
275,Should communication be included in a WBS?,"I am trying to create my first WBS for the relocation of my company's offices as an IT person. So far, I broke the jobs that have to be done down to parts:  1   Documentation 1.1.    Infrastructure 1.2.    Floor plan 1.3.    People plan 1.4.    Software &amp; build analysis 1.5.    Fixed assets  2   Cabling 2.1.    Network 2.2.    Electrical 2.3.    Voice  3   Infrastructure 3.1.    Barcode scanners 3.2.    Routers/switches 3.3.    Workstations 3.4.    Printers 3.5.    Telephones  4   Services 4.1.    File server storage and files 4.2.    Print server  5   Testing 5.1.    Connectivity 5.2.    Workstations 5.3.    Phones  I would like to listen to your opinion from an Infrastructure and Network department's perspective for my project. Also, as I have to communicate with several managers, colleagues, office owners etc. do you suggest I should include this as a section in my WBS ? Let's say :   Communication  Discuss risk management with manager Ask for orders of new network equipment Call support agent for overtime costs etc.    Communication is a huge sector in moving offices to another place. Should I include it ? "
276,What objective criteria can be used in staffing a project with engineers?,"Being a project manager what objective criteria do you use when recruiting new technical engineers to your project? Typically their resumes are full of magic buzz words. How to select the right person, objectively? "
277,Question about documenting project hours on PMP application,"I've been working in a PMO since July of 2013. I estimate that I have roughly 3520 hours of project hours from working there. I got this estimate by counting 22 months between then and now and multiplied by 160 hours a month to get 3520 hours. At this pace, I estimate I would have 4500 hours in about 28 months. Do my projects need to span at least 36 months before I can take the test even though I would have the 4500 hours?  When I was in college I was a member of a business organization. We would report to a national headquarters. Each school year, we would have specific goals for things like recruiting new members and planning different types of events (professional development, community service, fundraising, etc.). We maintained a budget with somewhat defined and controlled record keeping. Each school year, we would report progress and results to headquarters and accumulate ""points"" depending on things like how many events we planned and executed and how many new members we recruited. Would I be able to consider these as ""project hours"" or am I only allowed to count paid work experience? "
278,Should the customer developers be part of our scrum team?,"If during a sprint some task depends on customer development, should the customer developers considered as part of the team? At the sprint planning meeting should these developer attend to share how much time to be done for that task? "
279,How should the Product Owner prioritize the backlog?,"Should the Product Owner prioritize the backlog side-by-side with the customer? Must this step be done during the Sprint Planning Meeting, or could it be done before the meeting? Is the meeting restricted only to the Product Owner and the Team? "
280,How to get a correct duration in MS Project?,"I have two effort driven tasks with a work of 8h for each of them. If I delete the duration of task 5, Project fills the field with 1 day?    What I need to do is update the work for this task, for example I update to 9 hrs then modifies it back to 8 hrs    In this case it automatically updates the Duration as expected because John Doe works on this task at 20%.   The problem is that if I delete the duration (mistake), it goes back to 1 day?.   How can I be sure my Durations are correct? "
281,"What are the ""pillars"" of the Kanban process?","The Scrum Guide states:     Three pillars uphold every implementation of empirical process   control: transparency, inspection, and adaptation.   What are the pillars of the Kanban process? Are they the same or is something different?  N.B. I understand that Kanban surely has transparency via kanban board or other information radiators; inspection is also done regularly and there are even explicit rules for adaptation towards finishing expedited items or managing the delivery process. Nevertheless, the quote is from the Scrum Guide, which is a different framework. "
282,What is the average (intended) timeframe for 5 Whys Analysis?,"In a 5 Whys Analysis what would be the typical timeframe for the full process?  As a reference let's consider the ""engine not working"" example, in orders of magnitude (minutes, hours, days).  Is there any guidance or best practice?  Is it supposed to be a fast brainstorming or a meticulous drill-down of each why-step? "
283,Is it possible to control a project without start date and durations?,"In a discussion about the project plan with my team we collected activities, brought them into order and defined end dates. When we came to defining start dates and durations one of the elder team members (with some PM experience) told me, that it wouldn't make sense to define start dates because we only need the end dates of each action and it is in the duty of each member to start his own action at the right time. Other team members chimed in telling me that each estimation would be a lie.  In my opinion this is plain wrong. I agree that estimations of effort are always inaccurate to a certain degree, but this is life and one could try to handle it by time buffers. Otherwise these team members are just telling me that they don't know much about their job or are just too lazy to think about their work. Leaving out the start date and durations for these silly reasons makes it just impossible for me to control the project and ask for a status before actions are delayed. Am I missing something that old practitioners know? Otherwise - how do you get such team members to reliably provide the desired information? "
284,Is the Product Owner the boss of a Scrum Team?,"The Scrum Guide states the Product Owner is the sole person responsible for managing the Product Backlog. Product Backlog management includes:   Clearly expressing Product Backlog items; Ordering the items in the Product Backlog to best achieve goals and missions; Ensuring the value of the work the Development Team performs; Ensuring that the Product Backlog is visible, transparent, and clear to all, and shows what the Scrum Team will work on next; and, Ensuring the Development Team understands items in the Product Backlog to the level needed.   So why does my Scrum Coach where I work say the Product Owner is the boss of the Scrum Team? My Product Owner is not a Development Manager, Architect etc but a BA that has been given this role. Can anyone clarify? "
285,Predicting release date change in Kanban due to PROD issues,"We are transiting from Scrum to Kanban. One of the things we need to still have to stick to some deadlines (stakeholders need to know some dates).  We have some classes of tasks negotiated with clients (SLA levels). They also have:   Fixed deadline - ordinary tasks that turn into high priority if the deadline is very close. High priority - tasks to be done as soon as possible. Expendite - all current work needs to be abandoned and this issue should be addressed. (like PROD env is down or equivalent)   We do grooming of backlog, break deadline items into tasks, decorate them with deadline time. After some time the deadline is approaching, some of the tasks turn to be high priority. Still we are confident about our commitment.  But our boss comes and tells to start working on something equally important (other thing or PROD issue). Now, we understand that we can't deliver committed features on time.   1. How those situation are managed in Kanban?  2. Are there any application that can calculate automatically new delivery date?   P.S. Team is multifunctional so not everybody can do all the work, so personal WIP are also imposed and should be calculated towards new dates. "
286,How to motivate a team? (software development OOP year 1 degree project),"I'm currently in college, working as part of at team for one of the CA projects.  it's a problem based learning project where we've been given a trigger and told to come up with something to represent it.We've been assigned to specific teams and we're not allowed change to another team. All problems/issues must be resolved within  the team.  We've decided to toy around with the idea of a game. The PBL procedure involves assigning roles to each team member and getting stuck in, analysing the problem, deciding on the best way to solve it, getting stuck into UML and coding etc... (we're using Java).  However, it seems to me that for the most part my fellow team members seem to lack enthusiasm for the task at hand. After our first lesson one member was assigned the task of printing out special ""trigger"" cards for the purpose of the next meeting, and one was supposed to update the log with the minutes of the last meeting. Now we're in week 3 and I've printed the cards myself and I've had to post on the online log and ask for it to be updated (4 days after the class).I find it quite distressing to be honest.  Last week we assigned tasks to each member, namely researching a specific type of game to see the feesability of using it for the project. I regularly composed and sent emails on my progress, ideas of how we could proceed, even diagrams and the beginning of UML class diagrams that might be useful. I got some response form one of the memebrs (4 on the team) but nothing from the others. In the mean time we got a mail from the lecturer saying he couldn't make the next class, but it wasn't an issue, the materials were online and he was just an observer this time anyway.  When I got to class the other day, one guy didn't show up, apparently it's too far to drive if there's not even a lecturer there (like the workshop would be much different anyway); and when we got into it, the other lads had come up with ""maybe some sort of pacman game would be good"", but that was it, no research, no ideas on how we might code it, nothing.  They completely shot my idea down as too much work, but didn't offer any suggestions to replace it.  I'm not the chair person on this team, how can I help motivate them to get stuck in without offending anyone? or maybe the team needs a shake up to get some life into it.   I really don't get the lack of interest or excitement, this is a part-time course, everyone has full time jobs, I'd imagine they're here because they have life experience and now know what they want, but listening to them talk, and the lack of ""buzz"" for the want of a better word, about the project doesn't instill confidence in our ability to get it done.  It kind of feels like I'm currently the driving force behind it, but I don't want to be pushy; however at this rate I can't see how we can complete the project on time. For the most part they only seem to communicate during college hours.  We've set up a shared workspace for task management, scheduling etc, but again no-one seems interested in maintaining it.  Is it me? am I expecting too much? am I that annoying ""me! me! me!"" individual in the group? I don't think so, am I wrong getting frustrated at the lack of movement? we're heading into week 4 now and while we've agreed a game ""template"" but it's only because I pushed it, they wanted to wait for the other guy to return, but then we'd be in week 5 of an 11 week project with no movement.   Sorry for the rant! I'd be very grateful for any words of wisdom you can provide.   thanks. "
287,High quality standards and efficiency as a vision,"In my former question I've asked about visions for a team with multiple projects. My boss suggested that we should aim ""working toward to high quality standards and efficiency"" (or something related/similar) since we are not perfect in these (who is it?).   Although it's a good direction and we take steps to improve our ways of working it does not seem to be a good vision since I feel myself weird to commit to this vision. Is it a great/poor vision? Why? "
288,Disadvantages of agile approach,"First of all, I like Agile.  But, as well known, ""there is no silver bullet"". Obviously, if agile methodologies still not ""rule the world"", agile approach have some shortcomings.  So, questions are:   What are disadvantages of agile methods? In what kind of projects better not to use agile approach?  "
289,Global calendars in MS-Project?,"If I replace a calendar in the Global.MPT file, will this calendar update all the other projects that are using it?  Suppose I make the following steps:   Copy a calendar to Global.MPT file. Create a new project file and start using the calendar I just copied in  point 1. Then, in another project, I made changes to the calendar. So I replace the one that was in the Global.MPT file (point 1).   Will the calendar get updated on all projects that are using it, for example the file mentioned in the point 2? "
290,Action when realising that the user story cannot be completed by the end of the sprint,"In Scrum with JIRA, what does Atlassian recommend us to do on the User Story when we realize mid-sprint that it cannot be completed within that sprint?  What I am doing now:  In my current practice, the story points are estimated on the User Story during Grooming, while the hours are estimated on the newly created sub-tasks during Sprint Planning. The User Story is completed when all sub-tasks are completed.  (If the User Story is originally thought to be small, no sub-tasks are created for it, and both story points and hours estimate will be on the User Story.)  There are times, sub-tasks are underestimated. At this point, I would split (edit) the in-progress sub-task to reflect what I will complete and the new sub-task with new hours estimation to reflect what I cannot complete. At the end of the sprint, the sub-task will roll over together with the User Story.  My concern is: at the end of the Sprint when the User Story returns to the backlog, and we do story point estimation on the remaining work and update on the User Story, will it impact any reports that used the original story point? "
291,Should project management software be comprised of the technologies the developers use?,"As owner of and project manager for a medium (~20 devs) Rails shop, I find myself constantly sifting through a dozen tabs trying to gauge any given project's current status. My team embraces continuous integration and rigorous unit testing; we use GitHub, Trello, FogBugz, and Slack for version control, feature/issue tracking, and communication respectively. I'm curious to know the daily work-flow of other PMs, especially before reporting to clients.  Internally, we're contemplating aggregating commit messages, Kanban sprites, recent Slack messages, open issues, etc. and some basic metrics into a single dashboard to simplify this ""dozen tabs"" conundrum. The aim of the internal project is to dissuade the replication we observed while using Asana. Tasks would be assigned through Asana and immediately find themselves on a Trello board.  Is there any value mapping textual exchanges, e.g. the assignment and completion of a feature in Trello, to the code base, e.g. a commit message and git hash?   Wondering if any other PMs would find such a dashboard useful? Whether we should open it to the public? "
292,Authority distribution at double subordination in matrix organization,"How authority should be distributed between functional management and project management? If clear definition of it is not exist, what steps should project manager do to have a higher priority among employees than heads of structural units?  To be more detailed: who should assign tasks to employees and (what is more important) who should prioritize tasks? If this is undefined or if this is responsibility of functional management, what should project manager do to make tasks (that related to his project) more prior? "
293,How do you calculate the number of days between two tasks in Microsoft Project?,"I've created an event planning project that explains all of the relevant tasks before, during, and after a given event in MS Project 2003. I would like to calculate the number of days between a given task and a task I've created called ""Host Event"". The best way I've been able to do it thus far is create a custom number column with a formula of:  Int([Project Finish]-8-[Start])   It essentially does the trick, as the ""Host Event"" task is 8 days away from the Project Finish date. However, this seems like bad coding because I hard-coded the 8 days and if I were to ever change any task durations after the ""Host Event"" task, it would completely throw off the formula.  Is there a better way that I can perform the following calculation?  Int([Project Finish]- [""Host Event"" Start])   Link to Microsoft Project File "
294,Who plans the items for an iteration/sprint?,"In DAD (Disciplined Agile Delivery), who is responsible when for moving work items from the release backlog to the iteration/sprint backlog?   I'd say that this is done by the scrum master during the iteration/sprint planning meeting. Is that right or should this be done by the overall project manager beforehand so that the iteration/sprint planning meeting is ""just"" used to reach a consensus about the iteration/sprint plan? "
295,Should I remove a User Story from a Sprint in progress if I know we can't complete it?,"In the sprint can we remove (move to the upcoming sprint) the planned stories (mid sprint), if we are 100% sure we can’t complete them?  Example given:   Suppose we planned to 5 stories to be completed in an sprint.  Midway the sprint we are sure one story can't be completed because of dependencies (or other reason).  Now can we remove this story so that, we have only 4 stories in the current sprint (and a cleaner burndown)?   I think we can’t do that, but have doubt.   The idea is that if we remove the user stories (which can’t be completed), we would have cleaner burndown chart.   What is the right way to approach this problem? "
296,Should we encourage a team member adding a feature on his own?,"Recently I had a colleague that implemented a feature without being in the plan or discussed in detail but on his own time during the weekend. The feature was discussed briefly, it is a technical improvement, that is not complicated but requires a big number of changes and it does change the way of work in that area.  I appreciate his dedication to the project and he is a fairly good developer, even if that feature is not a state of the art is still good, and it will be reviewed by peers before adding it, but it feels wrong to appraise extra work time (can lead to burnout) for a feature that wasn't discussed in-deep technically (step required by our way of work agreement). On the other hand, I am afraid that a bad comment would cut out his enthusiasm.  So should we encourage, welcome or prevent these situations? How would a good approach look like? "
297,Can (and should) Agile be used for Infrastructure projects?,"Is it possible to use agile methods for large IT infrastructure projects?  I am working on a large project where the development team uses agile methods, while the infrastructure (which is where I am involved) is being established using waterfall methods. We recently debated whether agile could be used throughout the project, but failed to reach a conclusion. If anyone has practical experience, what were the pros and cons of the approach? "
298,"When faced with a back of the envelope type question in a PM interview, is there a standard of accuracy that is expected?","Back of the envelope calculations are not meant to be very accurate - but they are meant to be better than random guesses. The process of making one usually helps remove bias from your answer, and should converge to a general ballpark which is close to the answer you're looking for.  Several PMs I've spoken with so far tell me that, when interviewing, while they don't expect a very accurate answer from a back of the envelope calculation for the interviewee, they do expect that the number won't be off by too much - that is, not more than one order of magnitude in either direction.  I was surprised to hear an answer so consistent - multiple PMs from multiple industries, citing exactly the one order of magnitude margin of error.   So, I'm wondering where that one order of magnitude number came from - is it some sort of industry-wide standard? Is there a methodology book or course that introduced it? Or is it just accidental anecdotal evidence from my social circle, and not spread much farther than that?  "
299,What are alternative methods of deciding how much employees get paid?,"In almost every company I've been to, pay is decided by a yearly review using feedback garnered from colleagues.  This has a lot of negatives associated with it. People save feedback until the year end, instead of giving it regularly. They end up only asking friends for feedback to get ""good marks"". The review itself inevitably ends up focusing on people's weaknesses instead of their strengths. There's a lot of data to show that tying reviews and feedback to pay is a really, really bad idea.  What alternatives exist?  Edit: I'm really looking for alternatives to reviews, not better ways to do performance reviews or better ways to tie pay to it. I pretty much share Esther Derby's feelings about formal review processes, and am looking for different ways to manage pay scales. It's possible to create environments in which feedback is given freely and informally. In that situation, a review process is irrelevant and harmful... except that I don't then know what to do about the pay. This is why I'm asking. I would prefer even to have pay not tied to individual performance at all. What alternatives out there exist? Has anyone tried anything different?  For reference, Joel Spolsky's article, ""Incentive Pay considered Harmful"", in which he quotes HBR:     ... at least two dozen studies over the last three decades have   conclusively shown that people who expect to receive a reward for   completing a task or for doing that task successfully simply do not   perform as well as those who expect no reward at all.      [HBR Sept/Oct 93]  "
300,Vision for a team with multiple projects,"Steve McConnell mentions in his Rapid Development book that a team needs a shared, elevating vision or goal to be a real team not just a group of people.   What could be the vision when there are multiple projects (with different goals) that the people work on? Is it possible at all?  Some background: We do some internal product development (with ambitious plans for the future) but this seems mostly a ""backup"" project for times when there are no other projects for actual clients or we have to wait for the clients to move on to the next task, etc. Sometimes more than one client projects are running, so some people are helping to more than one project at a time.  ""Our XYZ product has 20% of market share"" or something like this does not seem appropriate vision since client project usually has higher priority and developers are not allowed to work on product development those times. (Why should anyone commit to a goal which is unattainable, right?)  ""Bring a shiny new WXZ system to client Y"" also does not seem good goal since usually isn't the whole group working for client Y. "
301,Should bugs be treated as stories or as tasks?,"If you're using scrum you should know that there is a clear difference between tasks and stories. A story is something that is valuable to user. A task is a step to produce that value to user.  So, how shall we define a bug?  Is it something we should just fix?   Or,  Is it something that will put more value to user? "
302,How to actually empower self-organized team to remove its member?,"One of the parts of self-organization in agile (but this is not necessarily related only to agile) is that we look at the team's performance and focus on supporting the team doing their job the best they can.  Self-organized team may decide on many thing on their own to achieve better results. One of them may sometimes be the need to remove a team member.  So my question is how in practice do you achieve that? Have you been in such situation? What can be done at the team level, so that the team can actually be sure and even encouraged to do that (start the team member removal process)? How can the Scrum Master (or anybody in the similar position) support that process? What about the upper management?  Sometimes teams just talk on the side about it or there is a tension inside the team that you can feel, but I've never seen the next step taking place. "
303,Why might Senior Leadership push back on 'total time accounting',"The advantages of total time accounting seem self-evident to me, but I routinely get resistance from senior leadership when attempting to institutionalize this in the organizations I have been.  What makes CEO's, CFO's or accountants resistant to this as an idea?  Are there some hidden negative aspects to total time accounting I'm not aware of?  EDIT:  Lots of answers regarding the cost of instituting a time tracking system.  Just to clarify, this companies in question are US defense contractors and they all must adhere to DCAA rules.  Since the cost of implementing such a system is a ""sunk cost"", required to win a contract in the first place, then what are the sources of push back if the cost to implement and maintain the system is already incurred? "
304,"Strictly as PMs, how do you restore a broken relationship?","Going back to our day to day work, sometimes, we have to be direct. During those times, and during times of high stress (due to deadlines or other family reasons), people become more sensitive.  What steps can a PM take to fix a broken relationship? How can I determine if it is fixable?   When is it acceptable to have a broken relationship? "
305,What are pass/fail criteria for internal PM recruitment,"Within our organization, from time to time, we need to promote a person to become a Project Manager / Project Leader / Team Leader. The promotion used to be done based on someone's intuition or opinion, like:   This guy is communicative, he'll manage, This guy has 'people skills', he'll manage.   We've changed that approach by introducing ""internal PM school"". That is the background. Now, here is the problem:  How do we evaluate their skills after such internal training? I can imagine that it is quite easy for hard skills (risk management, planning, etc.), but what about the soft skills?    How can you evaluate which candidate can handle stressful situations better? Which candidate can communicate with clients better? Which candidate can build a real team from a bunch of people?   The main question is this: Are there any strict pass / fail criteria for PM recruitment? "
306,How to transition from programmer to project manager?,"I'm a programmer at a small company who's used to receiving projects by someone saying in a meeting: ""make an e-commerce website,"" and then I'll just take it upon myself to do it. The only requirements I receive are the ones I ask for.  We're expanding, and I've been tasked with leading the development/management of a  large web application. We will be utilizing a new in-house team of several programmers, as well as an outsourcing company.   In order to allow a new programmer to develop a component for this application, what should I provide to them?  What I'm really struggling with right now are determining the types of resources to provide, the level of separation that should exist between them, and how granular the details should be.  Let's say this project is an e-commerce website that will consist of a storefront, a shopping cart, and user registration, and I want a programmer to work on the user registration. I would greatly appreciate if someone can list out, very exactly, what should be provided, as, despite my best Googling, all I can find is high-level ""fluff"" about this. For example:   Should I include diagrams (UML?), and if so, which ones, and what should they be conveying? Should I prepare written documentation (like a spec sheet?), and if so, what types of details should be included? Should I provide things like functional/non-functional requirements, business requirements, etc.?  "
307,Will Project Managers Disappear in a Scrum World?,In a Scrum team there is no role of a project manager. Does that mean that project manager jobs will eventually disappear? What is a project manager supposed to do when organization starts to shift over to Scrum? 
308,Collaborate a Mobile App teams work with an API developed in another silo,We are currently setting up a development team that will deliver Web and iOS/Android App functionality. The team will stream their work in scrum sprints. The team will rely on an API managed by another team outside of the web/app team.  To ensure that we can develop as a feature team we rely on the support of the API team.  The question is how best to facilitate this?  Should the API developers be embedded and collocated with the web/app team and attend all the scrum ceremonies with the ability to effect the API on the web/app team's behalf?  Or  Is it possible to have an SLA in place whereby key API individuals work within the confines of the API team but are dedicated to any requests that flow from the web/app team either through release planning or work identified in technical tasks. The API team have to synch their release schedule with that of the web/api team?  Without a degree of control or visibility of the required changes being made to the API the web/app team will be at the risk of being blocked. 
309,What will be the standard increase of price from a Time and Material to a Fixed Price?,"Knowing there are pros and cons for each type of procurement contracts.  I am trying to find the real price % increase from a time and material contract with specific scope to a fixed price.  As an example.  Let's say you ask your vendor to prepare a contract to build 4 walls and a roof.  He comes back and he said, it will take me 10 gold coins. 5 coins for material and 1 coin for each day I work.  Later for reasons outside of everyone's control. I need to shift the total risk of the construction to the builder (in essence converting the contract to Fixed Price). I know it will be more expensive, but how much?  Is that going to increase 1 coin = 10% or 5 coins = 50% increase???  Any people in the forum with this expertise?    More details:   The SOW right now that we have is T&amp;M, so the buyer already has a quote. Because of legal reasons, we need to switch the contract to Fixed Price. Making the deal a bit more expensive for us, but also more secure. The scope is very fixed, is a simple solution.  There will be lots of control to limit scope creep.  "
310,Create team activities that will lead to an improved documentation process,"One of my goals for this year is to try to improve the documentation process within the R&amp;D-department. My first step have been to sit down with each developer and talk about documentation in general and how they feel about our current documentation process.  The (almost) unanimous response I got was;   I can't find the documentation I'm looking for. I don't trust the documentation I find as it is probably outdated because nobody updates documents once they are created. Process? Well we put whatever document we create in the documents folder and that folder is a mess... I miss information related to requirements, design and implementation. Creating documents can be hard. Document templates would help. It is very important that we document what we should do and what we have done!   This is terrible! Because this means that whatever documentation that is created is ""worthless"". The good thing is that I there is a common urge from the team to actually fix this.  We have a team building activity coming up in two weeks and my manager have given me a few hours for discussions around this topic. The question is - how would you spend these hours to make sure that you got the best result?    The background to this is that I a while back asked a question on how to resolve the problem of a non-existent pseudo process, How do I improve the development process when the only &#39;spec&#39; is a &quot;slogan&quot; from management.  As a consequence I have started working more on involving the team around the problems that I see. And less of my just keep presenting solutions to problems they haven't really thought about. "
311,MS-Project historical timeline,"I am using Microsoft Project 2003 for an historic timeline, this means historical dates that go back 1000s of years. I realize using ms-project may be overkill, but it is actually the same as a project, but with pre-modern start dates.  I tried doing this in Excel and got it to work after a fashion using my first date as a minus (for ex. -4026). Then I set up a custom format so that it appears as 4026 B.C.E. (B.C.E. represent ""anno mundi"" or ""BC""). I tried adding a spinner control but it's values cannot go below 0, so I can't highlight columns until I get to a positive date. Solved that by adding another row starting from 0.  Nevertheless, it's cumbersome, so I'd prefer to use MS-Project if possible.  Is this possible? Are there any alternatives?  Thanks in advance. "
312,How to appropriately balance project activities with support tasks,"I have a small team of experts (12 staff) who do great project work. Unfortunately, their expertise makes them the go-to individuals on support tasks as well. The inability to focus on projects affects their productivity and sometimes has a negative impact on morale.  Am I the only one who has this problem?  For those who manage small teams without the luxury of dedicated project staff versus support staff, what strategies have you implemented to ensure high morale and productivity and manage staff who feel like they are being pulled in a hundred different directions? "
313,How auto share resource for multiple tasks in MS Project,"Suppose I have three tasks, each task requires one resource (one engineer), if I have 3 separated resources, say A, B, C, how can I auto assign these resource to my tasks depending on availability.  As I know, one way I can manually assign A to task 1, B to task 2, C to task 3. But I have many tasks and many resources, I can't do it manually, is there any way this can be done automatically?  One workaround is I create one consolidate resource by set its unit to 300%, indicating 3 engineers, then assign it to all tasks. But in this way I can't track which resource is assign to which task exactly.  Any better idea? Thanks. "
314,Adding estimation points for learning / context switching,"In our scrum team, team members tend to add extra points in estimation when there is a ""learning"" part involved.  Here's a simple silly example. Let's say all the people in a team are experts in C# but with less knowledge of C++. They have a task to implement feature X in C# and they estimate it to 5 points. If they would be asked to implement the exact same thing in C++ estimation would be let's say 8, because they added some points to figure out how to do it in C++.  In our team it happens sometimes that for each task a couple of people didn't work in that area of code (as we ore owners of more than 1 project) so they always add a couple of extra points for learning or for context-switching (if they didn't work in that area for a longer period) when estimating. Is this correct?  Do you add learning in your estimations?  Thanks "
315,What does person-month mean in development time?,"I have a question about communication channels that is talking about person-month but I don't understand what is a person-month. Does it mean this many persons? or this many months?  Here is the full context:     Based on statistical data in a company, communication path between two   persons consumes 5% of each person’s time (during a 8-hour work day).   For a project that requires 12 persons-months of development time, how   many people will be needed to finish the project in four-months if (a)   the democratic team structure is used and (b) the chief-programmer   team structure is used. If the team consists of four persons, what is   the difference in the completion time for a team using the democratic   structure and a team using the chief-programmer structure?  "
316,Dashboard question on microsoft project,"Completion % captures the current progress.. I understand that. Is there a way to come up with completion % if all work (hypothetically) was completed on time as of today?  e.g., Assume the total duration is 400 hrs. Today, the total duration scheduled to be completed was 200 hrs, however only 50% of the work was done. Therefore, %complete is 25% and, if the task was completed on time, then the %complete should be 50%.  How do we capture the latter completion %? "
317,MS Project: Few basis questions on tasks management," I have seen different managers entering preferred Duration in days and some in  hours. Is there any best practice? I have seen many manager will update ""% complete"" to update a task progress. Is this perfect way to capture process? Someone told me, If you have a task with more than 40 hours, break it down further into smaller tasks. It may not be possible. Right? Having said that, I have seen tasks in MPP with over 200 hours. Is there any best practice here?  "
318,Skills unavailable currently in our team,"We have a IT staff of 5 persons:   1 senior with C and PHP skills. 1 senior with Java and database skills. 1 senior with Flex and Actionscript skills. He get some C# with .Net 2.5 skills, since he followed a training, but he never really used them, so it's not worth much anymore. 1 intern and another incoming in the next days. Both will leave in September. 1 apprentice, which means he's part time in our company and part time in his engineering school, on a 3 months cycle. He just left last week and will be back in June.   All the seniors work in the company since 4 years and are fully committed.  Apart our online photo sharing application, we get a Windows desktop application which makes it possible to burn video DVD with the slideshows made with the online application. It's written with Zinc, an alternative to Adobe AIR, with some Imapi code and FFMpeg.  Currently, this application is a pain for all the team because it's way to buggy due to technical limitations of Zinc. So we want to remake it from scratch in C#, which will allow us to get a much better software.  And here comes the real matter: We cannot afford to hire another senior engineer, and we don't have currently the C# skills in-house.  Here are some solution ideas:   contact an IT consulting company to rent us C# experts. I'm not so fond of this solution. I worked in the IT service business, and I know what some of their so called experts are worth... find a freelance C# developer hire a C# expert for a short time contract hire an IT consulting company to do the job   I have to confess none of these really make me happy. What do you think? Any innovative idea? "
319,Should I work with another manager or take on his responsibilities?,"A manager of equal level in the org chart is in charge of a team that is responsible for a critical delivery piece in one of my projects.  He generally assigns his team deadlines that have no room for error. This creates anxiety in my team and for the overall project. (Incidentally, his team is almost always late &mdash; costing money and customer satisfaction.)  Our boss (the CEO) has a hands-off approach and will not intervene. However, if positioned correctly, he would support me directly working with the other manager's team.  How would I work with the other manager?  Should I take on his responsibilities? "
320,How do I get Microsoft Visual Studio 2012 to display a burndown of individual epics?,How do I create an Epic Burn-down chart in Visual Studio 2012? Can I do it in Urban Turtle?  I am new to managing software projects with Microsoft Visual Studio 2012. I've been using Jira Agile for the last two years and can easily create a burndown chart for each epic in Jira. I'm trying to replicate the same thing in Visual Studio 2012 and TFS.  
321,WBS and Project management,"I have 2 doubts about the WBS and project management and the ongoing progress of the project.  WBS is decomposition of a project into deliverables. The lowest level or unit of work within a deliverable is a work package. In a work package we can define the activities involved to produce that deliverable.  If we talk about a project like CAR, the WBS would be like (only work packages):  CAR + Engine   + Cylinder   + Piston      + Head      + Body      + Oil ring   + Shaft + Body   Then we can work on the activities of the HEAD work package as follows    - design head - get a prototype - manufacture head - test head - etc.   First doubt  On a IT project context or even the car, is it correct to include project management as a deliverable that include multiple management processes like this? (I am combining the WBS with the activities in the work package)  MY PROJECT + Project Management (Supposed to do this in a fast tracking)   + Scope management (work package)     + Create scope statement      + Create WBS      + Create WBS dictionnary     + Scope baseline (MILESTONE)   + Resources management (work package)     + Get resources calendar     + Assign resources to project     + Resources matrix (MILESTONE) + Deployment (Deliverable)   + Database (Work package)     + Create database      + Execute scripts     + Created database (MILESTONE)   + Website (Work package) ... ...   Second doubt  Where can I place the ongoing progress activities of the project. Let's say that you already defined all the planned activities in a work package, but it is suppossed that you can add activities from coordinations with your client as soon as don't change your scope. It should be great to schedule these activities from coordinations to track time, progress and cost within the budget.  Will you include a deliverable Analysis or Execution as deliverable and decompose it until a work package where I could include ongoing activities with the client? Do you have a link to share of a WBS of a real IT project as model?  Analysis and Execution would look like phases of my project, that's why I getting confused about how to structure my schedule that harmonizes my WBS.  "
322,Rewards or Penalties? Or just rewards?,"What motivational mechanism works more effectively - penalties or rewards? I'm also interested to know whether penalties are used in modern software development teams. If they are - in what form?  ps. Please pay attention that I didn't say ""monetary"" rewards or penalties.  pps. I've written an article recently, on this very subject: Monetary Awards Can Work "
323,How to identify risks?,"What risk identification methods you recommend to use? If a project manager needs to build a raw list of risks containing, say, 100 items, how would he/she do it? As I understand, brain storming is not the best mechanism here.  PS. I finally managed to create my own system for that: 0rsk.com: Cause + Risk + Effect "
324,Number of communication channels in Chief-Programmer model,"In democratic model if there are n people in a team the formula to calculate the number of communication channels is n*(n-1)/2  But there is also another model called Chief-Programmer model and the formula to calculate the number of communication channels is a little different, I searched in Google and all I found was this: [website]"
325,How open source projects work without project manager?,"Somebody told me the open source projects go ahead without project managers and it was interesting for me to know is this really true? If so, how does it happen? "
326,Different workflows on one kanban board,"From reading discussions here the general consensus seems to be that you should have a ratio of one kanban board for one team.   How do you model multiple workflows in the team on one board?    Specifically, I suppose, how do you represent processes with discrete sub-tasks that require coorindation between people, while still being able to implement a policy to limit work in progress, and being able to see the ""capacity"" and ""backlog""?    To give a real example, our team has multiple kanban boards:   Board 1: Regular one-off team tasks, such as ""check help desk"" Board 2: Article-creation workflow, which involves stages of:   Contacting people,  Interviewing them,  Passing the content to an editor,  and scheduling the content to be published  Board 3: Video-creation workflow, which involves stages of:   Decide on topic Record the video Produce the video Upload the video Pass the content to an editor and scheduling the content to be published    It works well to have multiple kanban boards describing specific proecesses. However, this also means the ""capacity"" of the team is not represented in any one place. "
327,WBS Common Work/Deliverable,"In work breakdown structure, how do I represent a common work that is being used by multiple higher-level-work/module? For example, in my development, I have multiple modules in my IT system, and two of them are Customer and Sales Order. These two modules require additional development whereby I need to synchronise the data (replication) to another server. How do I show it in WBS?  I have put up two examples as in the image, but both seems wrong to me.    Thanks. "
328,CMMI and SCRUM related jobs,"I am an IT student and have been working on team-based projects for several years. I have read some papers about CMMI and SCRUM, and this is really interesting to me and I would like to know what kind of jobs involve improving processes inside an organization.  What kind of studies can lead someone towards these jobs? Management? What's the idea? Management as a topic to be studied? And what other topics could be studied to lead to a job using such methodologies and frameworks? "
329,"Asked to assist on a technical level with a project, have misgivings about the direction and management of the project","The company I work for is looking to create a new version of their main software package, and wants to outsource the development to a local company. So far, so good. The non-technical project manager asked me for assistance (three months in), largely to ensure that he doesn't get the wool pulled over his eyes when discussing the technical elements.  However(!) firstly, there is no structure on our end to deal with creating a proposal to give to potential partners. There is the project manager, assisted to some degree by his technically minded, but busy father (also employed at the company) and an enthusiastic final year university student, and now, me.  Secondly, the project manager has produced a ""Funtional Spec"", influenced by his father, which deals largely with how the project should work (Django, jQuery, MySQL), and very little with what the project should do.  Thirdly, we've only entered negotiations with one company.  I feel that we should have a structure in place at our end dealing with roles and responsibilities, that we should have a proper requirements document that deals with the ""what"", rather than the ""how"", and that we should be speaking to a good number of other potential contractors. I also think that a functional spec, dealing with how the project should work and which technologies will be used should be produced by the (outsourced) developer; I think that these decisions should be the responsibility of the person who is responsible for implementing them.  How, in the real world, ideally, should this process work? Who should be producing the functional spec? Am I right to worry about the way this project is going?  Thanks all for taking the time! "
330,Estimation and testing in project management,"I'm currently writing a paper regarding project management, and was wondering if anyone with experience could answer the following questions?   What are the steps involved in creating a testing process? (Are there a standard set of steps, as after searching the internet I could not find any) How can one refine cost estimation when in the design stage of a project?   For the first question, would the following be a valid explanation, or is this not a test process?    Design test cases Prepare test data Run program with test data Compare results to test data  "
331,"When working closely with sales, does storypoints still make sense vs time estimations","The main idea behind using story points is to take away focus on the absolute time/cost of a task and look at the relative sizing vs the other tasks you have in front of you.   This has worked well in all the other companies I have worked in. Here the typical setup is that you have a software team, working on a product, and a product owner which can use the story point estimations to prioritize one feature over another for the next sprint and/or release.  However, in my current position it's a bit different. We develop software for a hardware platform we sell to customers. However, all sales requires us to tweak our software to match the customers' needs[1], and this tweaking is often a significant cost for the company when selling a product.  Therefore sales/management always needs an estimate of how time-consuming various customer-related tasks are, so they can factor this number into their offers when they bid on jobs.  We spend roughly 50% of our time integrating our base software into customer specific solutions, and 50% of the time on improving our base system.  Question: In this case. Does it even make sense to try to abstract away time/money from the development using story points, since numbers are always so close anyway?  When sales comes and asks: ""[The customer is willing to pay [tex]1 million then the amount of story points for the task, and make a direct transformation.  You could argue that you should not tell the developers about the actual number, but I don't like this for two reasons:   I don't know what you actually gain from it here. You still need a direct story point->time->cost transformation We are only around 20 people in total, 8 in software. A sale is a huge thing, and I think taking away information of how everything is going would stress people more than giving them peace of mind to ""just work on development"".   [1] Either to make it integrate into their current system(s) or give them an edge in their market. "
332,Is it a testers responsibility to gather requirements from the client & create a scope document?,"I am working on project as manual tester with 2 years of experience. In my company there is 1 BA, 1 project manager and 2 marketing guys. However nobody wants to gather requirements from the client; they are asking me to do so and create a scope document.  I do not have any experience doing this. I asked my BA and PM to do so; they said ""this is your job, not ours"". Is this correct?  I want to know who is typically the correct person/position to do the requirement gathering from clients and convert them into a scope document.  Also, if any team member asks any question to the BA/PM/the person who gathered the requirements, should the person asked resolve these queries or reply ""talk to client directly""? When a team member asks the question to a client which he has already cleared to the person who gathered the requirement, the client gets frustrated. What should a person do in this case? "
333,Deciding how many bugs to leave as unresolved,"I work primarily on small-scale (and large-scale) software projects. One of the questions that always needs answering is how do we decide how many bugs should we fix?  Realistically, software always has bugs. And these bugs are of different types; data corruption bugs are not the same as the-border-color-is-wrong bugs.  Some project management methodologies answer this question directly or indirectly; Six Sigma comes to mind (leave no more than one bug per one-point-something-million), as do Clean Room and Zero Defect methodologies (no bugs allowed, period).  But how do I decide how many bugs I should fix? What do I look at? Some metrics might be:   How many bugs do I have budget for fixing (fix as many as possible until launch) How many customers are complaining about bugs (fix bugs that multiple people complain about) Severity of bugs (fix data-corruption and software-halts bugs only) ...   To summarize and clarify, I'm looking for a method or technique I can apply to come up with a set of guidelines on which bugs to fix and which to ignore. "
334,(Calculation EMV) What is the business purpose of product value calculated by multiplying the probability of an event by the cost of the impact?,"Lets say you are going on a geological survey up on a mountain in the rural areas.  ( Page 576, Head First PMP 3rd Edition, Jennifer Greene, PMP  &amp;  Andrew Stellman, PMP ) Expected Monetary Value (EMV)  Risk:   High Winds Probability:  35% Impact:  cost $48 to replace equipment  Risk:  Mudslide Probability:  5% Impact:  lose $750 in damage costs  Risk:  Wind generator is usable Probability:  15% Impact:  save $800 in battery costs  Risk:  Truck rental Unavailable Probability:  10% Impact:   cost $350 last-minute rental  Calculating EMV for each Risk High Winds:  35%  x -[tex]16.80 Mudslide:   5%  x -[tex]37.50 Wind Generator:  15%  x [tex]120 Truck Rental:  10% x -[tex]35  EMV  =  -[tex]37.50) + [tex]35) = -$30.70  I am confused about the business significance of multiplying the percentage probability by the cost impact.

335,"How to create a ""smart"" checklist in excel or google sheets?","We have a need to create a template checklist for our workflow and at a past job we had a template checklist that had various tabs for each process of the workshare that needed to be complete. For instance, that job was GIS related and each tab of the checklist contained what ""theme"" (ie, layer of the map) of the production mapping process needed to be complete before starting on the next theme. Each theme of the checklist was a tab that contained rows of things that needed to be complete for that theme and contributed to an overall percent complete that was tracked throughout each tab in the checklist. When a task was completed for that tab, we initialed a box, the percentage was updated, and we moved on to the next task. The first tab was always the same and would shape how the rest of the checklist was formatted based off of answers given to yes and no questions or from a series of dropdown menus.   What I'm really asking here is can all of this be completed through what is available in regular excel without needing to download other extensions? Can I make a look up table or a flow chart of some sort to model out the rest of the checklist? If so, where and how can this be completed within excel? "
336,Is cost management part of Project Management?,"Is Cost Management (Estimation and Control) part of Project Mangement?  Are cost management techniques (COCOMO, Function Point, etc) part of PM? Or only Software Project Management?  I ask this because whenever I open a book about Project Management, I don't find these topics covered.  "
337,"Shared backend resources for two mobile SCRUM teams, iOS and Android","Here is my situation:   I work with two SCRUM teams, iOS and Android Each of the SCRUM team has its own Product and Sprint backlogs We have shared Sprint Plannings, Reviews and Retrospectives (both teams attend) so that the products can stay aligned and that a given team can benefit from the knowledge of another team in tackling a specific problem as well as in story point estimation  Because the roadmap and features of both iOS and Android are pretty similar, both products are sharing the same backend engineers as resources. As a result, we create backend subtasks for given user stories in sprints and backend engineers attend Sprint Planning as part of the cross-functional team.   But what is the best practice here for integration of the necessary backend work?   Do you include this backend work in your user story estimates for one of the teams (i.e. iOS team), knowing that once the backend work will then also be done for the other client team which might be lagging behind?   How do you include backend work in your velocity estimates?   And should backend have its own backlog, separate of the mobile teams,  or only be considered the owner of backend subtasks in each of the mobile teams' sprints? "
338,Handling unskilled / unmotivated team members,"I am a project manager, for a major project at school. One of my team members had joined the team as a developer, without knowledge of particular languages. The member has spent almost half the project's estimated duration without contributing. All the extra developmental burden has fallen on me, as I am PM and responsible for it.  During meetings the member always nods, agrees and accepts to work by a given deadline. But when the deadline comes and goes, there is absolutely no response. I don't mean to bitch, but these are the facts, truly. I spend most of my time almost baby-sitting, by going thru the coding with the member and explaining how to code during one-on-one meetings.   I have tried to give extra time for the member to come upto speed, and spent time trying to train him. All has been almost wasted, because the member either is too busy with other self important work, or too slow to learn or plain simple incompetent or lazy.   Can you give any suggestions as to how I can encourage the member to put solid time and effort into contributing towards the project ?   dropping the member off the team is highly unprofessional, but should I consider it if it becomes too much of time-constraint issue ? or should I keep using reward-only policy ?  I am sort of frustrated and don't know how to proceed.   Thank you-Egon.    Well, as suggested, the team member is now preparing slides, writing documentation, and all such secondary work. Thnx folks to help me make up my mind. "
339,Risk register vs risk report,"Risk documents normally are documents in possession of the Project Manager with the discretion to show only to Project Team and Sponsor.  Risk register is a document that contains all the work involved in the identification, quantification, qualification and evaluation of risks in matrix/table.   Questions   Risk report, is it a narrative document in summary of all the risks from the risk register? Is it addressed exclusively to Sponsor? Other than him? Are both deliverables? (Guess: Yes as they are output from Processes from PMI methodology) If both are deliverables they should be in the WBS?  "
340,Non-measurable works should be done in scrum process?,I think that I have some misunderstandings from scrum.  Estimates of some tasks are not measurable. For example researching about something or talking about company road map and etc. I can't estimate how many story points needed to complete these tasks.   Should I define backlog items for this kind of jobs and put them into a sprint? Then how can I estimate them?  Or I have to do them outside of scrum process? For example between 2 sprints. 
341,WBS and Project Planning,"It can look like repetitive, but I come again with the same question from here about WBS and planning deliverables.   I was ""advised"" in a meeting recently to include a planning deliverable leg. And  a WBS deliverable at n-level if I want to measure time, cost, tasks and resources later.  As far as I know, WBS is equals to Scope of the project. Schedule are the activities to produce a deliverable, thus there is a strong relation between both. A block of activities that are not related to a deliverable it may be wrong and should be included in or update the WBS.  As far as we are in the planning phase of the project, there is no problem to update the WBS. In the contrary, if WBS got approved, the only way to update it is through a formal change process.  Should I include a WBS deliverable at n-level within my Planning leg of my global WBS in the early stages of the project? (Let's say when the project team is building it with post-it notes).  I know that it is an error to include SO MUCH DETAILS in the WBS or activities as long as we can measure progress and fulfill with the objective of the deliverable and get the success of the project.  I am curious about what would be your suggestions to include the WBS deliverable within the WBS ""graphically"". How do you deal with this. Any examples? Or your deliverable would be scope statement directly?  EDIT: Scope baseline = Scope statement + WBS + WBS dictionnary. "
342,Name of the Project lifecycle without full lifecycle,"In our company, we have projects following from Customer Requirement with meeting up to Product delivery with training and documents as the full life cycle.  But for some projects, we are doing 'Task-Based works'. That is, the customer asks us to do only part of the life-cycle ... the remaining work is taken care of by them. For example, Product development has done by them but they send the result to us for Testing. As another example, we will do only Functional design specification and initial configuration. Like this, we are having some projects mostly billing as per the time sheets rather than a lump-sum price.  So, under which method do such kind of projects fall? Some referred to this as the Agile methodology. Is that correct? If not, then what is the correct terminology for such works? Currently, we are referring to them as 'Task-Based Projects'. "
343,Mobile apps: integrate backend work in velocity?,"Here is my situation:   I work with two SCRUM teams, iOS and Android Each of the SCRUM team has its own Product and Sprint backlogs We have shared Sprint Plannings, Reviews and Retrospectives (both teams attend) so that the products can stay aligned and that a given team can benefit from the knowledge of another team in tackling a specific problem as well as in story point estimation   Because the roadmap and features of both iOS and Android are pretty similar, both products are sharing the same backend engineers as resources. As a result, we create backend subtasks for given user stories in sprints and backend engineers attend Sprint Planning as part of the cross-functional team.  By backend work I mean server side work. We're talking about mobile apps here, so anything related to user management for instance. i.e. let's assume a user wants to delete his profile but he can't yet. A user profile deletion CTA would need to be available on the client, but it would need to work with HTTP requests to the server. So here, as part of the same user story (""as a user, I want to be able to delete my profile), we would have both client and server work together.  Do you include this backend work in your user story estimates for one of the teams (i.e. iOS team), knowing that once the backend work will then also be done for the other client team which might be lagging behind? How do you include backend work in your velocity estimates? "
344,What is the correct way to handle delays caused by technical issues?,"I am working on a Web Design and Development project for my Final. I have missed Alpha and Beta milestones due to a critical server error that was beyond my knowledge or understanding. I had to get in touch with a qualified professional to help me rectify this error which took approximately a week and a half to address.  I should note, at this time, I sat down with my instructor multiple times, and he could not understand the issue, either.  My instructors have been giving me a hard time about it, so I am trying to be as professional as possible, considering it had nothing to do with my code (which was fine).  What kind of paperwork is processed if this were to happen with a development firm? What is generally said at the meeting? How should I best address this? I have absolutely zero training in project management. I am simply working on my own project for a Final, yet I need to know how  to handle myself as a project lead professionally in order to get my point across.  I would desperately like a piece of paperwork that documents the issue. "
345,How should a Software Tester deal with missed Defects/bugs in Production?,"I work as a QA/test engineer in a small software company.  I was assigned on Multiple(7 different) projects by my superiors in which i do testing, requirement gathering, client updates, resolving developers/clients queries &amp; etc.I mostly do functional/black-box testing. Before the production release or showing it to client, I tested many good scenarios and found lots of  defects in the code. Most of them got fixed. I did my analysis and sent it to client for his approval. I had a good test strategy. Now, this module went live in production servers and client have encountered  few bugs which appears on specific conditions which he reported to me.Then i checked them &amp; sent to Developer so that they can fix it but in response i got a mail from senior saying that ""how did you missed this bugs you are not taking your job seriously this should not happen once you release it to client it has to be 100% bug free client should never encounter any bug, developer is  not responsible for it only you is responsible for Quality &amp; this mistake should never happen again"".  I'm a junior tester here,My seniors and the stakeholders don't trust my work as a tester, as how dare I say that it PASS the QA. They think that I'm careless, not worthy of working, and risky.  Is it really possible to make any software bug free?   QA is the only person responsible for Bugs? even if he is testing several different projects at the same time &amp; updating multiple clients &amp; trying to complete the projects in deadline(Where time for testing &amp; resolving bugs is not mentioned in the project scope &amp; not even charging the client for same)?  I just want to know how to deal with this situation. can anyone suggest me what to do? "
346,Can the Scrum Master groom the Sprint Backlog?,"Our company is migrating to Scrum. I've been thrust into the role of Scrum Master (with no formal training--but I'm working on that). Our team doesn't have a product owner due to the structure of our company and because we service all the other teams in the company. Instead, the team leads within our department liaise with the other product owners.  Up to now, I've centralized all all backlog management to myself. I create the PBIs and tasks, with input from the team and team leads, in an effort to clear their plates of the minutia of ticket management.  However, I read this in The Scrum Guide today:     As new work is required, the Development Team adds it to the Sprint   Backlog. As work is performed or completed, the estimated remaining   work is updated. When elements of the plan are deemed unnecessary,   they are removed. Only the Development Team can change its Sprint   Backlog during a Sprint. The Sprint Backlog is a highly visible,   real-time picture of the work that the Development Team plans to   accomplish during the Sprint, and it belongs solely to the   Development Team.   I am not entirely clear, from The Scrum Guide, whether or not the Scrum Master is considered part of the Development Team. In other courses, I believe the term Scrum Team refers to the Scrum Master, Product Owner, and Development Team, and the term Development Team refers simply to the product development staff (developers, testers, designers, etc.).  My question is, should I be hands-off when it comes to the Sprint Backlog? Should the developers be creating tasks on the Sprint Backlog as necessary?  I have a sneaking suspicion I'm doing this all wrong. "
347,Scrum Task Board Customization in TFS 2015,"Background: I have worked with many scrum teams over the past 5 years using Atlassian JIRA. I changed companies and they are using TFS 2015.  Issue: Using JIRA there was one scrum board per team and that all roles on the scrum team use the scrum board to understand where stories are in the process during the sprint. It gave the QA member information around when a story was ready for testing, it gave DevOps information about when an item could be deployed, etc. etc.. In TFS 2015 the scrum board is fixed based on the BPI (or User Story depending on the Process Template you are using). It seems that during a sprint team members have to view both the BPI/UserStory board and the sprint board to get the full picture of what is happing with a BPI/Story in context of the sprint.  I don’t mind and kind of like the separation of concerns around the fact that epics, features, BPI/Stories have their own boards. This is great for the PO to track their process in preparing work for the team. What is frustrating to me is it seems that it would be better to allow the scrum team to define their scrum board to map to their process separate from what the product owner is doing on the BPI/Story board.   With this new job I am getting back into the Microsoft stack (I left it for ~5-6 years for the JBOSS/Tomcat/Apache/Linux stack). It seems to me Microsoft is being heavy-handed forcing development teams to do it the way they think it should be done versus giving the teams the flexibility to find what works for them. A lot of things about Microsoft gives me that impression and, for me, it is hard to swallow.  Is there a way to customize the sprint board (I have not found a way via the web interface)? Maybe the process template XML? Does anyone else feel this way? Am I thinking about this wrong? "
348,How to take minutes of meeting effectively?,"I have one on one meetings with manager and senior members of our company. They raise points in meetings and I note down on paper. Can anyone tell me what are the formats to note minutes of meetings? Which points should give more emphasize and which points one neglected in meetings? Please give day to day example so that it is easy for me to understand.   I am a trainee and recording minutes during meeting hours creates bad impression because they may think I'm neglecting them. So, when to record minutes? while meeting or after meeting? "
349,Going from requirements to use cases and how to know if my document is good enough,"I'm here again asking about software documentation. I read a lot about it but it is a bit harder to put in practice, first because of the lack of examples and second because most small companies just don't care at all.  So I have a set of requirements for functionalities for a iteration of a software that I and a friend is doing. see bellow:   The system shall enable users to login through a UI* where he enters a username* and password*. The system shall display an error message on a particular area of ​​the UI* If the user* enters a combination of wrong username and password. The system shall redirect the user to a welcome UI* after successfully logged in. The system shall allow each user to have an access level, forming a hierarchy where only users of higher levels can perform an action* on users* from lower levels. The system shall associate users* that have special permissions* for a custom group*. The system shall associate each user* with a group*. The system shall retain the permissions* per user if the user belongs to the custom group*. Otherwise the permissions* should be inherited from the group. The system shall enable password reset only generating an automatic password and sending to the user's* email. The system must store the following user information, login, group, password, name, email, mobile phone. The system should allow users to change their information. The system should enable administration of permissions* actions*, groups* and users* through a UI* where user's can add, delete, create and edit entries (eg. Add groups, delete users).   So should I challenge these requirements more? How can I test/challenge it effectively?  After that, how can I go from this set of requirements to use cases (assuming they are good enough) to Use case.   I know I need to start finding the actors. But the only actor I see is the 'user' and he will performing CRUD operations on users, actions, groups and permissions. But how should I detail these use cases, 'Manage users' for example? Or should I go for a deeper detail level? Like 'add user' 'create group', etc.  glossary *user: is the person who will use the system to manage it based on his privileges. *UI: user interface. *username: a set of characters with max length of 50 with alpha numeric chars. *password: a set of characters with max length of 50 with alpha numeric chars, must be encrypted. *group: a list of named groups that each user must be associated with. *actions: a list of actions a user can do on the system that must be associated with permissions. *permission: a list associating users and groups to a specific action.   Thank you guys. "
350,How should I structure requirements in Confluence?,"I've just started in a new company that has decided to become more agile. They have decided to create the requirement specification in Jira. As an ux/ interaction designer, I find it difficult to see the big picture when seeing the list of Epics and tasks in Jira.  I'm used to have requirements per page and per function as it sets the requirements in a context.  1) How should I structure a sort of Agile requirement specification in Confluence?    2) Can an Epic be e.g. Start Page or Profile Page? "
351,Should the ideal line in a burndown chart be changed when story scope changes during the Sprint?,"At the start of the Sprint right after the Sprint Planning, we can already draw a burndown chart with an ideal line. It's a straight declining line starting at the top left with the total amount of story points in the Sprint backlog. Let's say a 100 points. It goes down to 0 at the end of the Sprint.  When the team went faster than anticipated, the actual line drops below the ideal line. Let's say the team decides to add more work. That means more may actually become done in the Sprint.  In that case should the starting height of the ideal line be corrected for the added work? So it was at 100 points. Should it now start at let's say 105? "
352,Retiring from Military in 2020 - PMP ? Career Growth?,"I will be retiring from the military in the year 2020.  I have been a military pilot most of my entire career, and due to extensive TDY's and family sacrifice, I will not be pursuing a pilot job in civilian life.  I have a BA and MBA, from public, state universities.  I also hold a Top Secret Clearance and Speak Spanish/English both fluently (if it matters).  I have no problem traveling one week out of each month to off-site customer locations but the days of two, three weeks, and even months, on the road just will not work for my family anymore.  I would like to pursue an high-growth career industry that is challenging and rewarding.    Some questions if someone can assist:   Can my background and skills be ""transferred over"" into the PMP realm ?  What does career growth look like in the year 2020.  I understand that is five years away but I want to get started now with educating myself about the profession.   Also, what is ""starting salary"" and what kind of salary can be expected say at Year-3 as a PMP. Are most PMP's independent consultants or do they work as salaried employees at a company/organization ? Is there any particular sector or industry that PMP work is more common at than others ?   Aka more common in healthcare and less common in legal field ?   Thank you for your time and information !  Bill "
353,Recording a project meeting using a Dictaphone,When running a project meeting it is sometimes difficult to make meeting minutes/notes and lead the meeting. I have considered using a voice recording application so I can play back the meeting after to add more clarity to the notes I do manage to take down.  Does anyone actively record meetings? do you find this technique useful? 
354,How many minutes an employee worked?,"we have observed in our company that employees are prone to take multiple breaks during a typical 8 hours working day.   We wish to deploy a system which will keep a count of how many minutes an employee is using his terminal? If an employee is using the terminal, he will be shown online and while he is away for more than 2 minutes, he will be shown as offline.   At any point of time, the software will be able to calculate the number of hours an employees worked in the terminal. And the data will be available for both the employee and management.   We understand that using the terminal does not necessarily means productive work but its a part of a series of tasks towards improving employee productivity.   Can you suggest any appropriate software to measure the total amount of time an employee spent in front of his terminal in a day? The software will ideally log out when there is no activity in the terminal for 2 minutes. "
355,"What are the differences between a project assistant, manager, and secretary?",Is there a difference and if ‘yes’ does there exist a definition of their scopes?   I was asking aunt Google but got the impression from job descriptions that the scope or responsibilities overlap greatly. Is this the case? 
356,What alternatives are there to a weekly status report to collect team members' progress on assigned work?,"Each week I issue a personalised email to everyone in the business (there are only 17 of us) with the following headings:   Can you provide a brief status report for this week based on your assigned priorities (in this section I ask for status + estimated days remaining on the task). Did you need to divert onto anything else this week not in the priorities listed above (if so can you list briefly below along with an approx. estimate). Can you confirm your main priorities for next week?   The email relates to a 'Priorities' email sent out on a Monday morning detailing everybody's objectives for the week.  When I started doing this (I have been in my current organisation now for around 5 months) I had the following outcomes in mind from this email:   I could capture progress and get a sense for what is moving forward and what tasks are  'stuck' and not getting completed By asking for next weeks priorities I can populate next week's 'Priorities' email (I also suggest items here related to our overall company schedule that I oversee...)  By tracking interruptions I have a metric of what has caused delays in the project and where we can make improvements to limit these going forward.   But... these are the downsides:   It's a big effort to get together each week (composing, sending out, receiving, transferring into next week's 'Priorities' email) - I'd estimate the whole process takes me around 5 hours a week. People forget to reply to it as they are engrossed (quite rightly) in their every day work. Sometimes I'm out of the office or have other priorities that prevent me from getting it out (I've never failed to, but have come close) It feels sometimes as if 'the tail is wagging the dog' - i.e. I am collecting peoples priorities for the upcoming week, only to tell those people the following week what they have already told me..! I'm concerned that the status report is felt to be an unnecessary distraction by the team   We are developing our tools internally for project management and have recently introduced time tracking tools etc which I hope may mean I can begin to drop this rigid weekly status reporting.  Does anybody else employ a similar status report process, is it effective? Would you modify anything about my approach? "
357,What are the best practices/methods/tools/techniques for conflict identification in requirements?,"For the sake of this discussion requirements = user-stories (since I'm not differentiating any process per se and would like to get rid of any ambiguities).  It's quite common to have a set of about 100-500 requirements for small-medium systems. It's but natural that it takes a while for one to figure out which requirements are conflicting (more so when >1 stakeholder is involved). Either they are capture using Excel or index cards/post-its or maybe in some project management tool.   So just how does one go about conflict identification within requirements? What are the practices that you have employed and found useful (w.r.t. time/effort expended and conflicts identified).  Is conflict identification even worth it or is it preferable to resolve it 'when you get there' since it could lead to an expectation mismanagement if resolved later?  I'm NOT talking about -ility conflicts. Those are but obvious and should be clarified earlier IMO. I'm talking about conflicts between various functional requirements along with functional vs. non-functional clashes.  Some examples are:   Terminology conflicts - i.e. different terms used to refer to the same concept Structure conflicts - classic one being 'Date' - referred to as MM/DD/YY and as DD/MM/YYYY somewhere else Direct conflicts - giving one requirement will be known to not satisfy another e.g. for a calendar app participants time slots will be private vs the meeting organizer should be able to see the meeting time of all participants before deciding on a meeting slot   The latter (direct one) may or may not be negotiable, but identifying it early on will be quite worthwhile IMO.  It's quite cumbersome to go through each requirement at a time to identify conflicts. The best is to divide the effort and speed it up. Another strategy is to analyze the requirements hierarchically, but that may hide certain conflicts which would occur in the lower 'nodes' (and those are the ones that come to bite you later IMHO :)  I'm not aware of any tools/techniques/best practices that would help one identify conflicts with minimal time/effort overhead and hence the question. The above manual step is the best I know of. Yes, in an ideal world it'd be great to have the tool spew out potential conflicts but I don't know if any tool does it (or even a reasonably good job. Help?)  So in an ideal world (without natural language capable machines :) what's the best technique to apply for conflict identification (assuming it's human intensive) and what's been your experience in doing so? If it's not worth it, please elaborate on that too. "
358,How to track team's time utilization using tfs,"We have started using TFS 2012 as part of moving to Scrum methodology. One challenge that we are facing is that though I can set up the capacity per day of each team member, I have no clear idea as to which employee will be free(after completing the assigned task) so that I can tag him to the next sprint. I believe this has something to do with MS Project syncing to TFS 2012. Please shed some light on this.  Basically I want to look at each team member's work end date with respect to the current sprint. Is it possible in TFS 2012? If not, what is the alternative? "
359,Getting Training from a reliable Australian PRINCE2 training provider,"I'm looking for a reliable training provider in Australia for PRINCE2, preferably one that has flexible delivery (online/distance &amp; face-to-face) training available and want to put together some good criteria for selecting one.   Do I need to take the exam on-site with the trainer? This could be pricey travel-wise and is something I'd like to avoid. As far as other costs go, is there anything that is missing or other things I should take note of?  "
360,How do you refactor a story?,"We've been using Pivotal Tracker on a software library project for well over a year.  I'm the (admittedly not great) PM.  The team is very good about writing notes on the story cards as things progress, but sometimes we start having whole discussions as story comments as new realizations occur concerning the topic of the story.  I have a feeling that when too much discussion is taking place, it means the story needs to be refactored, but the following are not clear to me:   What kind of criteria to use to decide when something should be done? What actions are possible: create one or more stories, and maybe (or maybe not) retitle the existing story as part of that?  Are other options possible? Who should be doing that?  The story owner? How do you handle reallocation of points?  Do you add more points to the new stories? Do you adjust the points on the original story?     Basically, I'm looking for tips about how to detect when it's time to do something about a story, and what to do. "
361,Should the complexity estimate of a task change in scrum?,"I'll just start with an example. We have a repeating task ""Release library"" which in the beggining we agreed on an estimate of 2 points: it seemed to be twice as hard as our 1 point baseline.  As we have this task more and more often in our sprints, it got easier for us to do it, all the steps are known so now we tend to estimate the exact same task as a 1 point task.   Is this ok from scrum perspective? From my understanding, complexity-wise the task says the same thing and it should remain 2 points forever, just that now it's more simple for everybody, similiar to a 1 point task (which makes sense).   What should be done in similar cases? I see only 2 solutions which both feel wrong:   Estimate points remain the same, even though the task seems less complex than it used to be.    Decrease estimate points, but then you might see a decrease in team velocity. (of course if this happens more often).    Please consider the example just an example, imagine something similar to any other stories. "
362,Mentoring for new Project Managers,"I'm trying to figure out if and how to help people who become Project Manager / Project Leader for the first time. Not sure if it is a good name, but I'm trying to create kind of a ""mentoring system"" for new PMs.  From your experience:   Do you know any mentoring system for new PMs? Have you tried one (either as an experienced PM or as a new one)? What would you recommend: An experienced PM to work closely together with a new one for, let's say, a month, so they can discuss and / or react on daily basis? Or rather, they work separately (on their own projects) and meet once a given period of time (a few weeks?) just to talk, explain problems and provide solutions?  "
363,Why can't I find well elaborated criticism on agile/scrum on the web?,"After several years of agile and scrum hype around, I'd expect the first well-known reactions from ""bullshit!"" to ""magical!"" to be gone and I should be able to find some really elaborated articles that question the highly praised benefits of those modern management techniques. But I don't.  Aren't there any? Is scrum really that great? Is there a conspiracy going on? "
364,Running training session for a software product,"I am running a training session for external users of our software product soon, and am currently planning how to approach it. I have a good idea how to run through the specifics of our platform (sustainability data management and analysis), but how can I ensure that I keep it clear, relevant, and address all the needs of the audience?  1 - Does anyone know of any guidance out there on running such a session?   2 - Does anyone have any tips or tricks that can bring the session to life?  Any previous experiences or advice would be amazing, thanks!    Edit:  Thank you for the answers. After thinking on this and a little research, my current feeling to getting people to understand and remember the process of performing certain tasks is...   1 - start with the background, why they are here, what the benefit of the product is to them. make it relevant and important to them to get their attention. 2 - bring them up to speed with progress so far so they get the context, then explain what's next (the step they are involved in). 3 - introduce the main tasks they will be performing. explain all of the 'why' and 'what' now. this is key so that they can then concentrate solely on the 'how' when you.... 4 - ...run through visually and verbally the process for them to observe, keeping it simple and not distracting them with caveats or clauses. 5 - provide handouts and get them to run through a few exercises themselves, whilst helping and assisting. 6 - group questions, so that they can all benefit from each others first experiences. 7 - recap, then move onto the next task.     Does this seem like a good approach and structure?  "
365,"How can I get our BAs to provide business requirements, and stop confusing them with implementation","Our BAs (Business Analysts) have an annoying habit of providing us with system requirements, rather than business requirements.  Often times, they don't even know what the business requirement is.  It infuriates me, because I see a list of requirements, and it will be tied to the way it should be implemented, rather than the problem that should be solved.  A very contrived example would be, ""System should email customer an order confirmation."" instead of ""The customer needs to be informed that the order is confirmed.""  Granted, in this case, it will likely be an email.  However, there is a chance we make a business decision to be more personable and want to follow up orders with phone calls to verify they found everything they were looking for, etc...  Other examples are more insidious.  I was working with something that handled reallocating distribution to different locations based on sales.  The order is initially placed sending [tex]Y amount to store Y, and $Z amount to store Z.  However, 6 months had passed from the initial order, and we see that store Z is now outperforming store Y, who's sales have dropped.  We want to swap the goods we are distribution between the stores.  The business rules I were given were tied very closely to the implementation, and in many case, where X->Y, Y->Z and Z->X no swaps would occur, even though our eyes can see that we are literally just shuffling goods between stores.  So I suggested a new approach, queu up the orders we have, sort them, sort the stores based on sales, and then rematch the lists that way.  Ensuring the best selling stores get the largest orders.    However, because I don't actually know the business rule, and just know the shuffling algorithm I was given, which seems incorrect, fixing it involves going back to the users, and getting the business rules...which should have been done in the first place.  What I'm asking is, is there a trick to gathering good requirements that are based upon business rules?  How can I get the BAs to do this, when they aren't already.  I'm having a hard time know explaining the difference between business and system rules...and they clearly aren't grasping it.  How can I educate, and improve their abilities? "
366,How to get from differentiated salaries to the equal ones for the same position in company?,"Recently I found some interesting articles about salary politics (1), (2). I also believe that equal salaries makes life more simple and I generally favor simple and transparent solutions. I believe that when you pay good enough people can focus even more on their work.  But what is more interesting to me is not pros and cons of this concept, but rather how to move the organization from the state of differentiated salaries to the state of equal ones.  Do you have any ideas how to do it? Let's assume that differences between salaries for the same positions could reach 30%.   One problem that I see is that when salaries will grow to the highest for the position the company budget will suffer. On the other hand when I would make it Robin Hood way - take from the rich and give to the poor - I'm afraid that good people would leave the company.  Any ideas?

367,"Should defects flow through the Kanban board, or should they be tracked as issues?","One of the things that I'm still trying to wrap my head around is defect tracking.   Should we put defects on the Board and track them alongside the other items (new features, refactoring work etc), or should we track them as issues (issues are tracked separately and they show up on the board only when they are blocking something)?  Reason why their existence on the board gives me trouble is that they are variable in size. In majority of cases, such issues are an order of magnitude smaller than the other work that's on the board.   Because of that, I was thinking about two options:   Introduce a separate swim lane for bugs only. In the beginning, we would like to keep it as wide as possible to force the team to go through existing issues faster (mostly edge cases and minor issues that piled up with time), and than make it narrower when we go through them. By keeping a dedicated swim lane for bugs even when there are no pressing production issues (which are always handled as expedited items), we will ensure that edge cases and minor bugs get cleaned instead of letting them pile up. Track them as issues in an issue tracking system and fix them the same way as we did. Risk here is that edge cases and minor issues would pile up, because such issues never get priority.   Should defects flow through the Kanban board, or should they be tracked as issues? "
368,Using Spreadsheet for Backlog - Dependencies and Priority,"I'm currently using a Google Spreadsheet to manage my product backlog. It has a list of stories, each with an identifier, feature it belongs to, story points, and the sprint that it's assigned to. It works well for most of my small projects; I simply add a collection of stories, estimate the work, carve off groups for sprints, and the project gets done.  However, there are two major failings that I can't seem to surmount; these are:   How can I effectively manage priorities within and across features? How do I indicate dependencies between stories?   As a preamble, I cannot move to any other project management tool, nor build my own. I tried both of these solutions; nothing works the way that I need it. (For example, I use the historical average velocity to plan new sprints.)  Issue #1: Managing Priorities. At the beginning of the project, I add dozens of stories, prioritize them amongst each other, and rank them with a priority number. However, since I need completed stories for historical purposes, I can't just sort by priority to find the next most important stories; I see a lot of clutter. I need to go through, checking the status of each story, and picking out the unfinished ones. Very tedious.  To make it worse, I add new stories in the middle, and some of them are high priority; but then, it becomes that every story is relative to every other story -- otherwise, I get a chunk of done, super-high-priority stories at the top that I always have to look at.  I've tried removing the priority number entirely and just shuffling stories; this seems to work a bit better, but doesn't let me easily view dependencies between stories.  Issue #2: Managing Dependencies I mentioned that I use a priority number; this allows me to implicitly code dependencies. if story A (with priority N) must be done before story B, I put story B's priority as N-1 or N-2.  This has several problems; first, if I split off work, I need to re-prioritize everything. Even if I use N-10 or N-100 instead, it still means a lot of manual renumbering.  Plus, I prefer not to use a priority number; but this makes it impossible to see which stories can be done in parallel, and which depend on each other.  I'm hoping there are good solutions to these. These are significant problems, and I'm keeping my scope very limited right now to work around them. "
369,What is the project manager's responsibility for the failed project?,"Some time ago I was involved into a so called death march project. In spite of the Brook's law, I was hired when project was in the yellow zone. Several weeks after I started on my new job, I've been asked and pushed to work overtime even though I didn't have chance to get a grip on the project (actually, it was a probationary period). Even though I didn't have the whole picture of the project, almost from the beginning I started to realize that project was savagely mismanaged.   Not diving into the causes of mismanagement (there are chances that several unpleasant risks might have been triggered all at once putting project into the yellow zone and manager just had to cut the corners), I would like to know what is the project management's ultimate responsibility for the failed project? There's been a discussion about whether it worth considering project failed or not. But let's assume that top-level decision has been made and this decision makes it clear that project has failed. What will be the responsibility/punishment of project manager for the failure then? Probably this should be covered before project is started (even written down, sealed, signed, whatever), but what if the responsibility for the failure has not been discussed and agreed? What is the default option in this case?  Possible answers are:   Damaged reputation (both person and company) Dismissal  Shutting down the project Torments of conscience   But that seems to be in some way incomplete and each solution might not be applicable in many cases.  Maybe project manager is not the only person who should be responsible for the failure? If not, then who else? Team as a whole, architect, business analyst lead, qa lead? How the responsibility could be shared in this case? After all, who decides?  I would like to get a clear understanding of how to deal with project manager who failed the project due to the mismanagement. Are there any best practices or any case is individual? Should there be some kind of investigation done by upper management in order to reveal mismanagement? If there are some generally accepted measures against people responsible for failure, especially project managers, I would like to hear it from you.  "

371,Questions about moving from JIRA to VSTS Agile,"We have a small team, and most of us are part-time. We have been managing the project using JIRA's simplified software template. We have started using Visual Studio Team Services (VSTS) for continuous integration and we like it. I would like to attempt to use VSTS to replace JIRA, but I am struggling with the differences between the tools.  Here is the workflow which has worked well for our small (non-full-time) team:   I pull a handful of stories out of the backlog, which we want to deliver. Assign them. Optionally break some into subtasks Developers work on them and move them to todo/done Tag each task with prod-fix or next-release (JIRA releases feature) I may pull a few more tasks onto the board as needed. We do a deployment/release. By marking a 'release' as done, they automatically get removed from the board.  I actually do 2 releases in JIRA: one for fixes and one for the new release. This helps keep track of what was done where. Repeat.   I would like to duplicate something like this in VSTS. But it seems that it is built around rigid Scrum practice, rather than our semi ad-hoc approach.  I created a new 'Agile' project in VSTS to try and duplicate our process. I have the following questions:   I see Features and Stories have separate backlogs.... why? Is there a    way to see them together?  I can see how I would use Iterations similarly to how I am using Releases in JIRA. But why do iterations have a backlog?  I figured out how to rename board columns on Features/Stories, but how do I rename the columns on the Iterations boards?  Is the 'Work Items' just a flat list of tasks?  Why do I need to go into Backlogs to a see the Current iteration? I have to explain to the Team that to see the board, they have to go under Work -> Backlogs -> Click the current Iteration -> Click Board? That is not going to go over well. Is there a quick way to get to the board for the current iteration? 99% of the team will only ever need that. It seems that Work -> Backlogs defaults to the board view of the current iteration. The the main issue is the odd naming, telling them to Backlogs to see their 'Current' tasks If I want to simplify things and Make Epics and Issues go away, can I do that? I foresee wasted time on people debating the difference between an epic and feature, and issue and bug, etc. Is there a way to get rid of the Capacity tab?  Can I rename priorities low/normal/high? I don't want debates of when 1 is     a higher priority than 4.  In some of the forms certain letters of words are underlined, such as the 'e' in State, and 'A' in Area, and 'r' in Iteration. What is the point of that? I can't find mention of it in shortcuts help.  How do you log work against task? Or do the Effort (hours) have to be manually recorded? (we rarely use this features, so not a big deal) Are areas equivalent to components in JIRA?  How do I complete an iteration? Start another? How do you mark a task as Resolved? It only lets me set it to New/Active/Closed? What is the diff between resolved and closed?   Any answers and thoughts appreciated. "
372,Is planning software necessary?,Is planning software necessary? Can you plan your project without one? 
373,What is good criteria for deciding what constitutes an individual task?,"My own background is in software dev and I've started work as a network engineering PM recently. In my previous PM work, creating documentation was a separate task. It was sometimes done by the software engineer who completed the task that needed to be documented, but sometimes done by someone else like a technical writer or junior engineer (then checked by the senior engineer). So it was a separate task with the task list looking something like this:   set up XYZ document XYZ configuration   In this environment, before I was around, they established that they don't have documentation tasks, that uploading documentation was what you did before you checked the task off because they say that it is not really complete unless it's documented. The result is I have a ton of tasks along the lines of ""Set up XYZ"" that are just hanging open because the person responsible doesn't have time to do the documentation yet. Their argument is that we have too many tasks already, that we have ""task bloat."" Indeed, we have some task lists that are 30 tasks long and it does seem a little daunting at times.   But I don't like this current practice because it looks like things aren't done in our PM software (TeamworkPM), which our clients also participate in and also I think sometimes the documentation tasks can be delegated to other people.   What is good criteria for deciding what constitutes a task? How can I balance granularity and ""task bloat""? "
374,What are the effects of rotating of professionals among different projects during software development?,"Currently, I am performing a research focused on the effects of rotation in software development.  So, I'm interested in understand how developers, software engineers, testers, that is, all individuals participating in the software development process, see and feel about this practice of rotation among projects or teams, that many companies apply.   So I was wondering, if someone around here has experienced this in his/her job. Like, you are in the middle of a project and the manager rotated you to another project. You had to leave your team, your tasks were assigned to another person and you start to work in a different project with a different team.   I'd like to know how does it feel, like, how was this experience? How did it happen? What were the positive aspects (good things that the rotation brought)? What were the negative aspects (bad things that the rotation brought)? How did it affect your performance at work? How did it affect your previous team? How do you see or what do you think about this process of rotation among different projects in the middle of the development?  I am very thankful in advance for all the answers. "

379,Statistical Product: How to handle projects effectively,"Some background: In our organization we develop statistical product and there are big team of statisticians. They often changed specification due to change in clients' requirements. We have n number of statistical tests and plots. The software is too big and programming effectively and efficiently is challenging.   So, how do you handle similar complex projects effectively in our organization?   In Agile they have a method called Envisioning, that means look into clients brain in advance to predict requirement. For any software development specification and requirements are learned in advance. I our case specification and requirements are changed often, so development changed too. can we tackle situation smartly to use programming hours effectively and increasing productivity?  "
380,How do you handle scheduling with developers who always come up with new cases in specifications?,"We are a small mobile development team (6 developers, 3 QA, 1 team leader). We're a little new to agile, and are just learning the ropes/making mistakes as we go. The whole team reports to a project manager in another country, who in turn talks to the client directly. This is done because of language barrier issues.  We are currently trying to adapt an agile procedure, where we do weekly scrums. For each release, here is the current flow:   The specifications are taken from the client in the beginning. After studying what the client wants to do, we prepare prototypes and questions/clarifications and have the project manager in the other country reword and prepare for the client. After the client replies, we either proceed to step 4 or repeat step 2 until everything is aligned. We start implementing the specifications.   I'm aware that not every issue or error case in the specifications is determined in step 2, and may still arise in the later phases of the current release. However, there are times when, in step 4, the developers still get cases (sometimes edge cases) that they assert that the cases need to be handled and we should repeat step 2 again. It's currently giving the team a bad reputation to the manager, and most likely the company a bad reputation to the client. For these kinds of issues, is it better to:   lock the specifications and any questions once step 2 is done, and move all the other cases (unless critical) to the next release for fixing add more time to step 2 (this, however, is also risky since giving more time for the developers give them more time to slack off (e.g. - the deadline is still far, I can take a breather for now))   I am aware this is a case-to-case basis, but on a general note, which would be better? Or are there any other possible solutions? "

382,How to build up a Gantt chart?,"I am a newbie to Project Management and I was not able, not yet at least, to attend a proper course and get a certification. Let's say I am learning on the ""field"". I am facing the managing of an EU project, which involves companies and universities, and Gantt chart is one of the many difficulties I am dealing with.  I will describe how am I approaching the problem so that you can hopefully tell me what I am doing wrong and how to fix it.  1- starting from the project idea, I discuss with all the partners to figure out who does what and how much money each partner need to complete the task complying with the overall project budget.  2- each partner is also supposed to tell me the amount of work they put in (persons month) in each task to complete it, which basically gives me two degrees of freedom (more workers on the WP (or task) ---> less duration of the WP (or task) and vice versa, right?  3- Once we have defined 1) and 2) I have to prepare a Gantt chart, and that's the rub!  How can I guess how to spread the WP, and then the tasks, duration within the whole project? Should my partners tell me that?  Now guessing I have the months on the x-axis of the chart, this is what I figured out:  Each university is basically looking to found a PhD/researcher position, this means one person ""fully-employed"" in the project. Then I should spread the months duration of the tasks in such a way that the researcher is fully employed each month, e.g. if one task require 10 person months it should last 10 months, is it right?  The partner companies can basically ""book"" hours, so they do not have to fulfill this requirement. Does it have to do with the way people?  Could you also suggest me any reference, books, articles and so on? "
383,"Everyone wants to talk, but no one listens","I have met more than one time a situation where everyone wants to talk, but no one wants to listen. For example:   Our team discusses where to go in our next team building trip.  Our team discusses a strategy for our next football match, and suddenly it  becomes a mess because everyone wants to present their point while the others are talking. Our team talk about silly small things, like how the report should be written and stuff... It's like almost always about the simple stuff that this situation occurs the most.   Usually, the work dispute will get resolved when an ""imperative voice"" from the boss/senior member is raised and forces everyone onto a solution. But, if that voice isn't credible enough (like in the case of the football match), it won't help.  How can you, as a project manager/leader, resolve this kind of situation? I mean, in the team there are some senior members whose ideas are often respected. And the junior team members seem to think they don't have a voice, so they find every opportunity to raise their voices. That often results in a mess, with unhappy team members.  I'd like if we could create an environment where every team member has his chance to speak and the team chooses what they think is the best solution. Is it that hard? "
384,Scrum Retrospective during holiday season,"The question in short: how should we handle a scrum retrospective when the capacity of the team has been very low?  Background  We have a team of 6 people: 1 PO, 4 developers (of whom 1 part-time on Monday and Friday) and 1 developer/SM (me). We have 1-week sprint starting on Monday and ending on Friday 9am, with the retrospective also being on Friday.  Due to varying summer holidays, tomorrow our sprint retrospective would be with one developer who worked Tuesday through Friday, the part-time developer (who did not work this Monday) and myself, having worked the full week.  I'm in favor of not skipping the retrospective, because I find inspection and adapting important. However, I fear we won't get much value from it, because only half the team will be there and only two of them have actually worked in the sprint.  Would it be wise to still hold a retrospective for this sprint? If so, what kind of activities would be useful for this kind of low-capacity retrospective? If not, should we skip it altogether or try to move it to another moment? "

387,Inter-Team Dynamics - Is it worth planning / optimizing for?,"In my organization I realize that at times there are teams that work better in certain combinations of devs (IE: John + Travis have a better dynamic than Dennis + Travis so they result in a faster working team).   I've been tinkering with the idea of finding a way to optimize teams internally but I'm still a bit green so I'm unsure if I'm seeing unrelated patterns.   Has anybody else found inter-team social dynamics impacting the end result of projects in terms of pace, quality, etc.? If otherwise, how much of an impact have you found group dynamics have on your projects? "
388,How do you manage resources in an agile approach with PMI,"In a case with limited people like 5, you need to go through an iterative process.  If you weight, distribute and assign the stories to be developed in a way that everyone is orchestrated well and you go in a 2-week sprint and normally you go through the following ""steps""  Sprint #1  Story #N   Design Code Unit Test   After unit tests, one of your resources finished the last story from sprint while others don't and for some reason there is 1 day or 2 days left. This idle resource what is suppossed to do?  In traditional approaches as everything is sequential mostly everyone finishes at the specific date or late than planned. Also in traditional, you risk to do rework and re-plan again, but how to manage that idle resource in a sprint. How do you track or do with those excellent story makers who finished before time? "
389,Should a team estimate tasks based on the executor's capacity or on the team average?,"My team is adopting Scrum. When estimating story points for a backlog item, we use planning poker to reflect the team's average vision of the story's complexity.  When estimating task hours within a story, should we plan based on the capacity of the person executing the task or on the team's average capacity? What happens if someone who is slower assumes that task? Should we then re-estimate the remaining work? "
390,How to represent an iterative sprint within your schedule list,"In an agile approach we can use tools like kanban to plan, measure and monitor sprints. But when we need to use schedule systems like MS Project or any other online collaboration tool that works like MS Project to show reports or gantt diagrams to our customers (because some of them work like this yet), how do you represent a recursive agile sprint execution within your classic schedule system?  In traditional PM:   You create your WBS. You reach the work package level. You define your tasks for that work package in your schedule system. You set up a baseline. You update progress.    Imagine that you are still going from classic to agile and you need to build a classic schedule management purposes. Normally you cannot add activities that are not aligned with your work package and are going over your triple constraint.  Do you normally add blocks of tasks with feature 1 version 1 and later feature 1 version 2 within the same deliverable and so on? How can you know how many iterations can be run in advance for same feature? "

A quick chat by the water cooler with a couple of guys from Ops support ended up in ""no way"" and ""you're nuts"". Not good.  How would you go about defining a project strategy that keeps everybody focused on what matters? I thought of something like this:   These are my commitments:   Provide detailed code documentation Provide detailed Standard Operating Procedures documentation Introduce Business Intelligence stake holders and ensure communication all across Propose a schedule for hand-off.  I would like to work with your team to    Assess the required resources for ongoing support Define the proper escalation process for enhancement requests Finalize the timing for an official hand-off.    Too simplistic? I welcome your input. Thanks! "

How would you mix effect mapping with agile stories? for people not using effect mapping, that i think is 99% of people, how do you approach the eye bird project view before starting with the first iteration?

Should we have all our projects combined as a single project in JIRA?  How can we combine stories from different projects in a single sprint?  Maybe our projects should actually be epics? Or something else?  UPD  Sorry for delay. ""Project"" for us it is some part of our big web-site. For example ""Search 2.0"" or ""Integration with XYZ"". Project has deadlines.

The word ""must"" really confuses me. Thats why I would choose false, when I had been asked this question.  Is the quoted statement true or false? "
398,Prioritization: How do I know if I should do it based on time to completion or difficulty?,"One of the key problems I face when it comes to project management is determining when I should prioritize based on time or difficulty.   Thus far, I have no method of determining something like this; for the most part, I end up just doing it based on difficulty but I would like to employ a more rigorous method that is backed by some research and logic.   My question:      When do I prioritize based on time to complete a task or the difficulty of the task?   Thanks!  P.S. What are some other ways of thinking about this? I understand that there are other variables at play i.e. deadline, impact of the task etc.  "
399,Why does our Sprint Planning not align with our original Release Plan?,"Our scrum team has provided high level estimates for the project we are working during release planning meeting.    The team provided guesstimated hours as well as Story points for each of the stories in the release backlog. Based on this we arrived at an end date and communicated it to the client.  As we got into Sprints, we got into a situation where the stories in the backlog needed to be decomposed into multiple stories and as a result of that our end date got pushed out and we communicated the same to the customer and he was OK with it.    We were having regular product backlog grooming sessions as well. But, when we get into Sprint planning meeting, the team's estimate on user stories are again changing and again as a result of that the stories are getting decomposed and the size of the stories also increasing - with this the end date for the release backlog also having an effect. And this happened more than couple of occasions for our release backlog.  Where are we getting it wrong? How could we rectify the situation so that the team can finish what was committed to client during release planning OR at least come close to what was promised?  Thanks "
400,When should I do analysis and design regarding Scrum's Sprint planning?,"The analysis and design may take long, normally more than a day even for a 2-week sprint.  If I do them during sprint planning, then the planning will take too long, which normally should not be more than 8 hours.  If I do them before the planning, then it means I do them at last Sprint. This doesn’t sound scrum, right?  If I do them after the planning, then after I do them, work division and estimation may be different big time. As a result,the schedule changes a lot and the original Sprint plan may be kind of useless. I guess this is not a good way to manage expectations from the Product owner and the organzation, right? "
401,How do you deal with external customers in agile projects,"You are starting an agile project. As a scrum master you are facilitator and you assist the product owner with the backlog in creation as also in its maintance. You also coordinate with external customer communications to report progress on the project.  Your self-organized team is ready to start the sprints for the project.  Everything is set up, but imagine that those clients that are not used to this agile approach and are not aware of the iterations in testing sprints and they are only waiting for the final deliverable to test everything like in the classical approach.  How do you train or deal with your clients who are not aware yet of an agile approach?  EDIT:  Let's say that you once you already started your project and got your initial scope/objectives, you build your 2-week sprints for all the features to be built with dates and what is to be tested and how each feature fulfills the objective (Expecting to be used later as an input to a new iteration).  But as I said, customer does not have ""resources"" to test and give many feedback about the deliverables, because they are used to the classical approach where you expect to gather all the information from conception and refine data slightly through execution then later they want to perform testing effort later (This could fail and could drive to rework) As a scrum master, explain the benefits of the approach, you explain them about the whole process, but still they are not convinced. 2 risks here:   They would believe they can ask anything infinitely, which you need to make clear that if it's not. Customer reacts negatively because as I said they don't have resources. You can escalate or negotiate with stakeholders or whatever is the authority to report progress nicely. But in this 2nd point you react, to me, as typical PM.   As your team is already agile, they are self-organized and empowered to manage their sprints with the product owner. You don't have the ""control"" as a regular PM. Don't misunderstand me, I think the agile approach is great to create motivated teams and spread creativity.   What are your strategies from experience to deal with customers with no experience in agile approaches? "
402,How to handle costly risks?,In general risk costs are not estimated as part of the initial estimates.  How do you handle these costs?  Through Change Requests? Any other thoughts on these costs? What is the best way to communicate these to Senior Management and Sponspors? 
403,What techniques to use to lead teams to a decision?,"Let's say you have a small team 3-10 people and some kind of decision needs to be made. What are some techniques for encouraging a decision to be made and/or accepted?  I'm not sure I can pick a good concrete example as the answer might be different depending on the type of decision.  Maybe describing a situation first: The team needs to make a decision about something but no one is actually making the decision. The manager, or PM, might then say, ""okay, how about we do X"" but gets no feedback from the team on if it's the right decision, or a decision they agree with.  What techniques exist for encouraging consensus? Is this a problem of leadership that that PM isn't leading well so no one is following? What techniques could help solve that, whether it's getting the team to make the decision or, for them to at least follow if they're not going to choose? "
404,Who decides how much work should be included in each Sprint?,"Once we have groomed the backlog and have a relatively clear direction of what should be done in short and long term, how do we decide what to include in each Sprint? Who makes that decision?    It seems like agile methodologies allow the team to decide, but what happens if the team plays things too safe and undercommits? "
405,Where should we start in trying to improve our automative design team for next season?,"Currently a business student in university. Looking for assistance in finding or developing a framework for a successful automotive design season next year.   Overview of the team:   We design, build, and race an open wheeled, single seat racecar.  We have requirements gathering, design, build, and test phases that are iterative. We have 10-15 system team leaders for various aspects of the car (powertrain, drivetrain, electrical,chassis, etc.).   Just a bit of background. I joined this automotive design team last year, and noticed that the team was bogged down with myriad process-related issues. They had unrealistic deadlines, unproductive meetings,  communication issues, slow and inefficient design updates, overall chaos, etc, etc.  I feel that this issue largely stems from a lack of a framework or way of approaching vehicle design...especially since no one has extensive experience in the industry or a serious interest in applying classroom knowledge to this project (as the sole business student, I feel responsible for this aspect of the team and I would love to apply some project management tools to this).   As a second year business student, I am aware of the major methodologies applied to software development like Agile and Scrum. Is there anything specific to engineering design? Where should we start in trying to improve the team for next season? "
406,How should an organization divide user stories between scrum teams?,"We have a development team that works on multiple ""products"". We create a unified user-stories backlog, and effectively treat the multiple products as different feature areas of the same virtual big product. Each iteration ideally focuses on related user stories, so that doesn't, in practice, get too crazy — although there's often high-priority unrelated items which make the cut.  My organization is growing to the point where it's no longer sustainable for there to be just one scrum team. I'm thinking about how to make this work so that the user stories are divided in a way that is a) functional for the teams and b) keeps all work focused on the overall priorities of the organization.  We want to keep one overall backlog for the multiple teams; keeping our whole organization working on unified priorities is part of the point of this whole thing. (And I've seen council that this is the right way to go.)  One obvious division is functional responsibilities. Product A and B go to Team 1, while product B and C go to Team 2. I expect that that's how most people do it. The problem with this is that sometimes products B and C might just not be a priority at all. (Since we work to an academic schedule, that is often the case at certain times of the year.) In that case, we end up with Team 2 working on items from further down the backlog which don't really match the priorities of the organization as a whole, just because hey, that's what their job says to do. A possible solution is to make the teams fluid, with team members shifted from Team 2 to Team 1 when Team 1's products are the current priority.  Another approach is to have the first part of the sprint planning meeting involve both teams. There would be a group discussion about which user stories go where, and how much each team can commit to. The clear problem with this is that it's hard to scale — but I've heard of people doing it nonetheless. One solution is for each team to only send delegates to this part of the planning meeting. These delegates would have the responsibility of negotiating a reasonable selection of user stories for their team.  Which approach is best, and why?  In the model where the teams have different areas of responsibilities but the team composition changes each cycle, when are the reassignments made and whose responsibility should that be?  In the model where the planning meeting includes all team members from all teams, how does one make that work effectively? Consensus is very difficult when there's more than a few people involved!  In the model where the initial part of the planning meeting is attended by delegates, how much authority should those delegates have and what happens when their commitments have a mismatch with the team?  Is there a refinement of these ideas or a different model for multi-team scrum that I should be looking at? "
407,What techniques do you use to establish scope in agile,"More than communications skills, lean techniques to discard useless features with no value, more than ask ""what do you want?"" or ""is there anything else?"" to the customer.  Reading the book Agile Project Management of James A. Crowder, it says: ""Organizations must strive to provide an environment where budget is not centered on time and motion, but must be centered on the perceived values of the objectives of the project.... In classical EV change is bad and uncertainty is worse"".   From the book Brilliant Agile Project Management of Rob Colle &amp; Edward Scotcher: ""Agile embraces change and even encourages it. Change is not seen as the enemy, it's seen as an important part of the evolution of any good idea.""  In an agile approach everything is speculative and scope never is closed until customer is satisfied.  It looks like to me that these statements are for internal projects in software companies like Facebook, Uber, Airbnb, or even in in-house projects where there is an initiative to improve processes continously.   In a context that you handle projects with external customers and projects with ad-hoc development, we are limited by the triple constraint all the time. What are the techniques you use to set up scope and minimize the number of iterations if we are in time-restricted contract?  Edit  *Triple constraint is the name that PMI uses to describe restrictions on any project in Time + Cost + Scope (+ Quality in 6th version of the PMBOK) Any change on any of this restrictions will affect the other. A change in time, it will affect your cost, any change in scope affects time and cost and so on.  This is so restrictive, fixed and old in terms of agile. Once you have your baseline, you cannot change it, but through a formal change process.  With external projects based on classic perspective, you manage contracts to deliver a product or service in a specific time and in a budget.   That's why in classic approach change is bad. If you change your baseline (time or cost or scope) it will drive you into a rework or reschedule. Nevertheless in agile, change is accepted all the time. Kind of 2 philosophies conflicting each other in change management, but we need to limit changes in a way to fulfill with deadlines. "
408,Role of a technical project manager?,"I have a project that's close to failing as the main developer has now left the company. To help get a sense of where the project is at, I created a thorough review of the project's WBS and the tasks that were completed.  Unknown to me earlier, the owner of the company told the lead dev to get the project done by x date and the lead dev is now going to start working using the document I created.  My concerns:   The lead dev does not wish to provide the number of hours required to finish the remainder of the tasks (so I don't know how meeting x date is possible or it feels like it's out of my control). Should the lead dev not provide the number of hours so that a schedule can be properly created? I want to sit down with the lead dev and the secondary dev to get a sense of how they plan to accomplish finishing the remainder of the tasks by x date. Ideally, I would like to allocate tasks by date, i.e. finish task 1.1 and 1.2 by x date, 1.3 by y date and so on. Is this in my place to determine this (I'm being told it's not)?   I'm being told that I should let the lead dev plan this out and I am only to be given a percentage of completion.  I'm fine with any approach, but given that I have a technical background, it feels odd not to have a deeper insight into this project after spending a gruelling 7 months learning everything about it. "
409,Where is the place for project managers in agile,"A typical company that worked with project management with PMI methodology and resources.  Assume a specific business unit like:   2 projects with different external companies (contract) 2 project managers. They normally are linked to a customer accounts which in this case they have their 2 projects respectively. 1 senior lead developer A dev team.   Want to go over agile and you are transitioning progresively. Using a framework like Scrum we would need 1 Scrum master, 1 product owner and a Scrum team.  If you want to arrange roles for your 2 projects, your dev team would behave as the scrum team and you will empower them to be self-organizing and you will give all resources they need to accomplish their objectives. As I've been advised they should be only focused on one project at a time and not developing features from different projects in a sprint even if the product is the same. The final product is a platform and each project is for a procurement and accounting module. We will split the current team to be specialist on each module. We will have 2 scrum teams now, one per project/account.   Would you give the role of product owner to the senior lead developer? Who will be the Scrum master? Will you encourage a lead developer from your teams to be the scrum master or the existing project managers since there will be 2 teams to communicate? Would you limit your project managers to customer negotiation and project direction?  "
410,"What are defintions of Work Performance Data, Work Performance Information & Work Performance Reports, and their differences?","For the PMBOK 5th Edition.  Using following books for reference: - Head First PMP 3rd Edition, Jennifer Greene, PMP &amp; Andrew Stellman, PMP - PMP Project Management Professional Exam Study Guide, Kim Heldman, PMP  I am trying to understand the definitions of the following terms, and I'm also trying to understand the differences between each of the following terms, and how they relate to each other, and whether or not they overlap:  -Work Performance Data  -Work Performance Information  -Work Performance Reports  Could someone please correct me if I'm wrong?  Work Performance Data seems to be raw data that we directly get from ""Direct and Manage Project Work Process"" like the following:   % of work complete status of deliverables technical performance measurement actual start and finish date of activities ( schedule progress to date ) number of change requests number of defects cost incurred to date   Is it correct to state that the Work Performance Data is raw data that basically tells us about work completed on the project to date?  Work Performance Information seems to go a step further, and yields the following data:   forecasts for completion dates associated with activities forecasts for budget ( cost )   Is it correct to state that the Work Performance Information is forecast data that is based on raw data like Work Performance Data?  Work Performance Reports goes a step further by going to the giving more complex data like statistical data based on Work Performance Data and Work Performance Information, and Work Performance Reports could include status, reports, memos, updates, etc.   Earned Value Calculations Variance Analysis   Are the above definitions, and explanation of differences between terms correct? "
411,What should we do when we split an Epic and we still get XXXL user stories from it?,"We know by books that:  User stories should be Valuable, estimable, independend and so on...   We are newbies on all this SCRUM stuff, and we have arrive to the following feature / epic / backlog item:     ""Accept reservations by SMS""   The problem is that, none of us knows nothing about SMS sending and receiving services at the moment.  We can split this into small user stories, and split it into:     As a Restaurant Owner, I wish to receive my website reservations by   SMS on my phone, so that I can prepare the table for my customers.   And also:     As a restaurant site visitor, I wish to make a reservation so that I   can be assured that I will have a table once I arrive on the   restaurant.   But on both user stories, we still have a huge ??? factor.   Because we need to investigate HOW and WHAT are the technically features, before we can split those User Stories into something ""Small, Valuable, Estimable,  and so on...""  How can we deal with this?  We are thinking about creating on those USER STORIES, a TASK for ""Investigate further"". What say you? "
412,How to handle access to resources on a Scrum team which was previously a hierarchical team?,"From what I've read and learned about scrum from my recent reading, as well as years reading the great questions and answers on this site, a scrum team is a team of equals, where there's no hierarchy, and knowledge is shared vigorously.  Is it still possible that some members of the team may have specific access to a set of resources which others do not?  For instance, a database expert on the team may have the ability to run SQL queries against the live, production database, but one might not want everyone on the team to be able to do this who isn't trained in SQL. Is this a correct way of thinking, or would we give unrestricted access to all on the team and warn them not to break stuff?  What about simpler things, like the team's Slack instant messaging system?  It's arguably much harder to break Slack (or Sqwiggle, gitter.im, or any other instant messaging system).  Would it be expected that everyone be an admin to this system, or would a specific individual serve as the admin?    I am concerned about things like this because they could inadvertently preserve some of the pre-scrum hierarchy that exists prior to moving to the scrum framework. What is the best way to approach these things on a new scrum team which was previously non-scrum? "
413,Does Scrum makes sense for 12 members in a Development Team?,"Our team is consist of 12 people who work on one product. While Scrum says team size should be 3-9 people. So, should we not use Scrum only because of team size? We probably can't split the team, because we are mostly working on different tasks or stories related to one product. So although those stories and tasks are inter-connected in some way, they are not that all tasks are belonging to one story.   The problem right now is that our Daily Scrum is not 10 minutes meeting but it takes around 30-35 minutes which I don't think is efficient use of everyone's time. And not every detail is related to every member of team. But sometimes it is useful in a way that everyone member has an idea of what is going on in the team and if there is dependency then everyone is there to resolve it, as different stories are sometime inter-connected or probably someone on other irrelevant story can answer some question to resolve dependency.  So, what do you suggest? Should we keep the Daily Scrum as it is? Or should we make smaller teams in some way? I don't know how we can split it. There are mobile developers, back-end developers, QA, Devops guy, and BI guy. So how should we split it? Or we should keep doing it in the same way but with some changes you can suggest? "
414,CPI value at project closure,What should the CPI be after a project was closed (the project was not canceled)?  Must the CPI always move to 1 at project closure or could it remain at the last indicated value (example 0.85) before the project was closed?   We had a project and the week before the project was closed the CPI was 0.85. The project is now done and there will be no more work or costs. Should the CPI remain at 0.85? 
415,When does throwing in people to meet a Project's Scope or Time constraints ever work?,"While there's way too much wisdom and anecdotal evidence accumulated over the years that throwing new people into a project to magically close a scope-gap or a schedule-gap is a bad idea, I've noticed that seasoned leaders continue to try this, especially in the software development world (which gestates release babies faster than the typical 9 pregnant women).  Asking if there's a narrow set of conditions where this act of insanity ( adding new lines of communication and enduring the burden of ramp-up, training, having too many chefs in the kitchen, etc.) ACTUALLY ever helps a project succeed?  I can think of try-to-break-the-software usability testing where NOT knowing how a web application even works can possibly invite bug-bounties and having people show up as a mob to test.  Is there any other scenario that could work? "
416,How should I create a process for front end testing?,"We have a product similar to Photoshop and we have a lot of trouble in the testing period.   we started to use Agile Framework, in middle of project.   We have to use human manual testing to test visual effects (e.g. the opacity feature of background image)  Unit testing is not sufficient and is not applicable for the visual side (front end) of the application.   now we are using selenium for UI testing, but  it is not enough, because testers have to check screenshots which tooken by selenium. And there are more than 500 screenshoots for every release test.  we tried manuel tests but we missed a lot of cases (ex :  if z-index value of button greater than other elements, background opacity of button does not working). So i had a question ""how do they test Photoshop's features in Adobe ?"".  How should I test a very complicated user interface? "
417,Good approach to group different project stories in same sprints,"Would you consider is it good approach to group different user stories from different projects into one sprint? Have you ever detected pros/cons?  Let's say   1. Project A (Start 2017-01-05 Estimate End 2017-05-30)    US_A1    US_A2    US_A3    US_A4 2. Project B (Start 2017-03-01 Estimate End 2017-07-30)    US_B1    US_B2    US_B3    US_B4   Sprint of 2 weeks when dates of projects overlap and you have the same number of people for all your projects, but you have multiple Scrum masters (one per project) and one team  **Sprint 8 (Prj A &amp; Prj B)** US_A2 US_A4 US_B2 US_B3     Last update Jul 25, 2019  Forgot to mention that company performs multiple incremental iterations to improve a software/suite. Each project represents clients' requirements from different business units. That is why there is only one group of devs for the software, but many project managers with different goals, with different stories that can overlap in time and maybe in objectives.  "
418,How can I create a task for two developers to support testing?,"I'm trying to create a timeline for a server migration. Typically when it comes to testing our developers spend about 25% of their time supporting the testing. (Running batch processes, answering questions, etc) so I want to have a task for the two developers that runs alongside the task for the testing. Each developer should be on the task at 25%, and be able to be scheduled for other tasks while the testing is happening.  And I want auto-scheduling because the entire point is to get Project to calculate the schedule for me. Basically things will change based on when we get the servers, so I need to be able to put in the date of each server environment and have Project calculate everything out from there. But devs can be configuring one environment while the prior is being tested, while spending a portion of their time supporting the testing.   So for example of what I'd like to see:  Testing 120h? 7/15-7/30 Kathy Support 60h?  7/15-7/30 Mike[25%], Tim[25%] Other   8h?   7/18-7/20 Mike   I've tried every combination of Task Type/Effort Driven I can think of but it never quite works. The closest I got was using Fixed Work, which sets the ""Support"" task to the right dates but the ""Other"" task ends up being pushed out until after ""Support."" Also it has the duration of 120h? making it harder for me to read the hours from for an estimate...  So any idea how I can get it to do what I want?  EDIT: I just found out you can set the amount of ""Work"" in the Task Details Form (yay for hidden fields!) but it isn't really helping anything. "
419,What is a good total size for a Product Backlog?,"General  I realize the size of a product backlog will vary with each project.  But assuming a project that is large enough to require a significant length time, is there any research or statistics on diminishing returns in terms of refining stories and epics?  In Zsolt's answer: [website]This seems to be inline with the idea of Agile and Scrum. I'm wondering if there's a point where it is better to consolidate those stories into just epics, until such time as they may be in near future sprints.  What is a good size for a backlog, relative to the teams velocity?  Does it make sense to consolidate existing stories into epics, if they aren't to be worked on for a significant period of time? (Assuming that the epic will hold the same knowledge of the original stories)  Specific  This question stems from our specific case. We have nearly 400 stories, and complete an average of 5 per sprint, in 2 week sprints. This is mostly because the initial push into scrum was to get every possible story into the backlog, rather than to form epics and divide as true needs were discovered through iteration.  It obviously affects our ability to manage the upcoming stories, creating duplicates, wading through hundreds of possibly irrelevant or just wrong stories in the process. We are unable to update stories as new knowledge is gained, causing us to spend more time second guessing meaning and purpose of stories rather than iterating.  We do suffer from a lack of prioritization. However, I'm thinking the sheer number of stories is causing our product owner and stakeholders to not want to invest the time into prioritizing. It feels very chicken and egg.  I'm hoping to find some information I can use to suggest consolidating large numbers of stories into epics, to be broken down later, when the actual need for the epics is in the near future (4-8 sprints). "
420,"What about Prince2, FDD & Agile Development (with XP)?","Do you have any criticisms?  I've been having a hard time fitting it all together but I finally understand which parts go where and the need for me to customize to a certain degree to make them fit.  Problem is, the internet is full of rubbish. I can't tell you the amount of times I've seen: TDD vs FDD..they are 2 completely different things!  Please, help me untangle this web. Do these 3 appear to fit well:  Prince2 FDD Agile &amp; XP    Do you have anything you'd like to add? "
421,"During a Sprint, a DevTeam determines that it will not be able to finish the complete forecast. Who should review and adjust the Sprint work selected?","During Sprints' executions, I used to encounter a problem: the planned Sprint would not be able to finish as forecasted. Then in that case, who is responsible to review and adjust the Sprint work selected?  It is always a confusion in role model, either will it be done by by Product Owner or the Scrum Master? "
422,What evidence can I provide to my manager that changing the names of Scrum roles and artifacts is a bad idea?,"My group is working on implementing Scrum as a project management paradigm. Our manager is on board with the decision, but on at least two separate occasions has expressed concern that, if other organizations learn that we are implementing Scrum, that there will be confusion and friction within the greater organization because we are not a software team. To answer this, he wants us to not call it Scrum and think up other names for all of the Scrum roles and artifacts.  I immediately think that this is not a good idea and will create more problems than it solves; however, I'm also ready to concede that it might have that much of an effect. Is it really not as big of a deal as I think it is? If y'all foresee problems, how can I qualitatively and/or quantitatively convince him that this is a bad idea? "
423,Agile Scrum Storyboards,"At the moment I'm Scrum Master for my place of work. We have one Scrum Team in our organisation which is split across two sites:  Site 1: Scrum Master, Developer, QA  Site 2: Developer, Operational, QA  We currently employ the following Agile practices, which we used to reduce our backlog:   Monthly Sprints Daily Stand ups Burndown Artefacts Business Product Owners Group Estimations 3 monthly role swaps for the Scrum Master position within the team. Sprint Planning / Retrospective   Now over the past year this has worked amazingly and we now are looking at ""Agile Phase 2"" to improve the process further:   Planning Poker User Stories Velocity (Using points) Enhance our Sprint Planning with Stories Introduce the use of XPlanner+   Now I have been reading the excellent book by Mike Cohen on User Stories Applied for the stories part but i have a question concerning storyboards themselves.  We have Geo-Located teams within the UK, so i was going to have one Storyboard but upload pictures to a Sharepoint location for the other team who cannot access it. Is that the best practice? We dont want to invest in digital boards just yet, we want to see how the physical board pans out first.  Other Questions:  - What size board is the best to use?  - Any advice of what type of physical board to get (Metal, etc)  Thanks for the time any advice is much appreciated. "
424,Scrum of Scrum of Scrums,"What's the exact definition of this concept? Is it about a forum where multiple scrum masters working on a large product sync up their status or is it a brainstorming like session where multiple scrum masters working on multiple projects / products gather and share their process improvements, etc... ? "
425,"Are the 'Project Charter', 'PID', 'SoW', and the 'Project Proposal' different names for the same thing?",This is a basic question that was asked on another site (a precursor to this site) but that seemed to be very helpful to visitors.  Let me know if you find it useful.  When initiating a project there are many different names for the base project document which is compiled at the beginning of every project.  Like:  * Project Charter * PID (Project Initiation Document) * SoW (or Project Statement of Work) * Project Proposal * you can name others   Are those the same or similar (by content or purpose)? What makes them different? When should each one be used? 
426,Cumulative Flow,"This project--developing web-based modules--is currently in its testing phase.  On a daily basis, the team captures testing results and progress using a cumulative flow diagram. The testing phase is only beginning and is scheduled to go out until mid-August.  Based on the data exhibited here, what are your interpretation and findings on the health of this phase so far?  What risks does this chart exhibit?    "
427,Any good lesson on how to grow Project Managers?,"As part of the Project Management journey I have started with my Company I am planning to grow Project Management capability within the Company Functions by creating a training program for future Project Managers.  In my current strategy I am including formal PRINCE2 foundation training, attendance to 3 1hr webinars I'll develop with Function Leaders focused on Company knowledge to give the trainee an exhaustive view of the business, and a mandatory requirement to execute a real Project, either as PM or Project Support. On top I will set up a bi-monthly Community of Practice call where the trainees will be able to share their Projects and learning.  How you do it in your Company? Any lesson to share on this? "
428,Software to to work with band practice,"Is there any software, preferably web based, that will allow a small group of people, a band, to communicate easily, share song lists and songs, and notes?   The song list is simply a list of songs with some information. Excel can represent it quite easily but it would be nice to have SVN like characteristics(so modifications can be made but reverted if necessary) and the ability to view as pdf.  It should be easy enough to for non-tech savy people to use it(but of course be able to surf the web, etc...). That is, no software to install(or very few dependencies) and no technical jargon needed to use... minimal interface, etc.  The idea is to get away from email which can be a hassle to manage and move on to something that is more centralized.  Anything like this exists? "
429,Can story points remain constant between the initial estimate and later planning sessions?,"Background   We have a bunch of epic stories.   We have a fixed term to do the project.   We have to get approval from a project board. We don't know the velocity of the project team yet.   The project board wants to estimate epics with story points and then split those epics into smaller stories where the points all add up to parent story. Variance in later estimates is punishable.  Question  If I hold an estimation session for a dozen large epic stories using the fairly large numbers, 20 points and upwards, this number comes out to 400 points. I later break those epics down into smaller stories and estimate them for an increment. I am under pressure from my project board to have very little variance in these later estimates. For example, the smaller stories should all add up to the estimate of their 'parent' epic, and all the smaller stories should continue to add up to 400.  I have my own views on this, but wonder:   How desirable is this process from the team's point of view? Is it a realistic expectation? Are story points related at all between the initial estimate and later sessions?   What do other people do in these situations? I'm more than happy to clarify any of the points if it will help. "
430,How do we deal with a website vendor plugin Integration when we're using Scrum?,"we're working with a popular website platform vendor, which is a great platform for building websites, and they have a vibrant community of third party vendors who integrate with their platform.  However, this vendor apparently does not have a checklist, acceptance criteria, that a plugin must contain in order to be accepted into their marketplace. As such, the team has worked on this for several months, with the plugin getting rejected and a new ""checklist"" being produced by the vendor.  The vendor refuses to produce a definitive, final checklist.  Since we're implementing Scrum in our organization, and for many of us it is our first time actually using it, I'm trying to understand more about how to handle items of great uncertainty.  If we commit to ""Integration with website vendor X's marketplace"", and we continue to fail to deliver this in our two week sprint due to forces outside our control, how should management and the team look at this?     Does it mean the team didn't complete what it committed to?  Wouldn't this be considered a ""failure"" to deliver what was promised?    Since this item cannot be estimated for a 2 week sprint, how would the team deal with this?     Should the team just keep recycling this back to the product backlog and selecting it again for another sprint, knowing that the velocity for this particular item won't be counted until it is done?   What do you do in cases of such extreme uncertainty due to a third party vendor's inability to clarify requirements?  "
431,Do project managers use RAID Logs?,"Project management theorists discuss the importance of the RAID log (Risks, Assumptions, Issues, Dependencies).   I have found in software development there is commonly the Issues log (which is actually the requirements log), and none of the other logs are present nor ever mentioned.  Do project managers use RAID Logs? If so why and how do you use them? Are they as critical as theory would indicate?  How could RAID logs be improved? "
432,Do you track the cause of bugs?,"I was thinking of tagging resolved cases by their (probable) cause, e.g.   incomplete feature specification last-minute fix after test typo ...   Maybe common causes might show up in this, so we get feedback and take precise steps to prevent these. Or maybe this is just a futile exercise in statistics and blame circulation.   What do you think?  More general, what kind of analysis do you run on your issue tracker? What other information besides ""what should I do today?"" and ""can we deliver?"" do you get out of it? "
433,How to have your opinion and idea listened by more senior people?,"Why is it difficult for people to accept the right solution coming from a person who is new to the organization? Like if you see a place where some changes can lead to greater improvement and your team lead is busy surfing internet rather than trying to improve process, you suggest a small change and all hell cut loose on you. Get resentment feelings from team lead because the suggestion didn't come from him/her, project manager gets red eye on you because team lead represents the idea in such a way that it looks like deviating from the current process and will create risk, other peers start laughing just because they don't get it.  What does it take to improve your chances to do the right thing without making people feel that you are trying to get upper hand on them?.  Replica of the situation:  You have 20 cows. Farmer goes to the stable to milk cows in the morning. Each cow has a bucket assigned to it. Each bucket is numbered 1,2,3...20.   Problem: How do you know which cow's milk is in which bucket. Just because cows are put up in a queue, doesn't mean that first cow's milk in the bucket 1 and second cows milk is in bucket 2. Current Solution: Well, that is how it has been for 20 years and they know it by heart. Proposed Solution: Number the cows also so that you can tie a cow to a bucket and you don't have spend time thinking which cow's milk is in which bucket or even if you hire a new person, you don;t have spend time on training the person on which cow's milk goes to which bucket. Better maintainability and easy and simple way to improve the situation on hand.   P.S.: i am not sure if this is the right place to ask this question. "

435,"How to present a ""customer impacted"" issue to senior management?","In production, there was an issue which impacted many customers. The issue was resolved in an hour but the damage was already done. Recovery is in progress. We need to explain this situation to Senior management.  What details are mandatory when reporting a ""customer impacted"" issue? What should we be presenting or emailing to senior management? "
436,What magazine / journal / paper would you subscribe?,"I'm looking for a magazine for IT PMs. I wonder if you subscribe to any of such magazine? If so, what are your recommendations?   I'd prefer a paper version rather that a digital version.  The idea behind this question is: where do you learn from? There are books, experience, trainings / meetings with other PMs. I wonder if you learn from magazines, and if so, what magazines. "
437,"With Scrum, how do you keep from dropping the little things?","We've moved our group's workflow to a scrum-based approach, with a lot of success. We're getting things done, people are more engaged, and we're more focused on our actual user community's needs.  Because we needed to work on processes over tools, we're using physical cards on a backlog board and a task board. This works pretty well, although we're probably going to move to an electronic version eventually as we're starting to get more remote team members.  This works very well for ""right sized"" user stories. But how do we deal with things that are really too small for a user story? Sometimes these are bugs/defects, or sometimes they're just really small feature requests or enhancements. For example, our Gitorious installation appends a superfluous s  to repository names when one makes a clone. It'd be nicer if it didn't.  One could write user stories for every thing like this (which is what we do), but a) it feels overweight and not at all ""agile"" and b) such stories inevitably get scheduled below bigger, more important things, even though they're often low-hanging fruit (small effort for small but noticeable results).  Or, one could have a separate issue tracker. However, that suddenly goes from one place to look for work — the scrum task board — to having two tools. Is there a good way to integrate these things so they don't act in opposition to each other?  Or, one could just leave these things out of the process and shout them at each other across the room. There's a serious risk of this becoming the de facto process if I don't fix this. When this works, it's basically fine, but it's problematic because a) it can disrupt productivity when people get distracted from their other work by unscheduled interruptions and b) when these issues aren't immediately fixed, they can (as the question title) get dropped. "
438,What measures and checks to implement for an effective Matrix Management project teams structure?,"I saw this image where there are nine managers, one supervisor, and one guy doing all of the work on a project, and something about it rang true. I've worked in two organisations that attempted to implement a matrix style of project management.   I've seen this go very wrong, with both places ending up with nearly equal hands off headcount to hands on.   How can this be avoided?  What can management do to avoid an organisational structure where there is too little leadership and too much management in comparison to those tasked with the work? What checks and balances are required?   "
439,What is a good git workflow that involves QA/Testing?,"So here's the scenario:  We've been developing this application for almost a year now. The application is already on production and we have:   3 Developers 2 QA guys 1 Team Lead (me)   We have worked through several workflows, some have worked better than the others, my simplest approach has been to do rolling releases as it involves less work from the developers and since we don't have a release manager (and I have to to a lot of other chores besides merging) the resources are scarce, that being said, my (horrible) workflow lately has been:   2 branches: development and master All branches are made from master development branch is free-for-all; everyone gets to merge there without pull requests whatsoever, for integration purposes When Developer A feels his feature is ready he makes a pull request against master Developer A then assigns the PR to Developer B for code review If code review goes well, Developer B assigns the PR to QA guy QA guy tests and if everything goes well, it goes to master, PR gets merged Customer goes to a staging server that is deployed when anything gets merged into master and if every feature tested is ok then we are free to (manually) deploy to production, these deployments are made manually   As you can guess the problem with this approach is that if the customer does not accept a feature (hence, there is a blocker) once it has been merged to master it means that we cannot ship to production anything, even if there were a bunch of other features which worked well.  Lately, our CTO has requested me to use gitflow and while I found it good and organized I can't seem to fit it in our development process. Here's what the customer wants:   Have a development environment that could be broken but shows progress on currently working features Have a staging or QA environment where feature-ready code is to be tested by both QA and the customer itself Have the ability to ship ""features not environments"" (quoting my CTO)   So I'm kinda lost on this, where and how should the testing happens? Cannot be done on development since it'll have unfinished features, probably broken code, we could do it on a QA environment or staging but then again, if they want to be able to cherry-pick features to deploy to production, and QA already has, say 3 features, how would you do that? More importantly, where does QA / Testing happens?  As said before, the CTO recommends gitflow, yet they want testing happening and release of isolated features instead of scheduled releases (where you do code freeze) I don't seem to get it, I have read several posts on SO but maybe I'm missing something.  So, in summary:   Where does qa/testing happens in gitflow? Is it possible to do feature-push instead of release-pushes to PROD?  "
440,How wise is sitting for PMP exam in changing year?,"I was planning to sit for PMP by the end of this year (November/December). I've through some books, prepared my experience documentation, obtained initial approval from supervisors, and set plans to get membership, and (if audit goes well), sit for the exam within 6 months.   However, few weeks ago, I noticed a new announcement by PMI stating the PMP is changing in 2015. When you read more, you find that the changes are not finalized yet (will be in 3 days form now), and that the last exam date for the current version is 1st November.   I do not expect I will be sitting for the exam before this date. Hence, most likely, I should start preparing for the new version. But at the same time, I do not know when to start that, because I'm not sure if the materials for the new version will be available soon or not. For example, I decided to prepare using PMBOK and another book called Head first PMP. But the current versions of each up to now cover the current PMP version and not the coming one.  Given the above information, my questions is, how wise is preparing for PMP this year? Will I suffer any serious changes (lack of material, examples ... etc), or it is not really that be significant? PMI changes PMP every couple of years. Have any one experienced any of these changes and their effects? What is the advice?   "
441,"Daily Standup, Demo, Retrospective - Mandatory? How?","I've got a bit of an involved question, here. (Apologies if I provided too much unnecessary explanation; if so just skip to 'The Problem'.) First, let me explain...  The Situation:  We're a middling-size company with a relatively small development department - 7 people. Until recently, pretty much all the work that came in was fairly small stuff, assigned to a single person, with the only project management being a simple ticket system (which no one even really used that often, anyway). Now, however, we've got a significantly-sized project - estimated at 18 months. For the sake of this project, we've started using actual project management techniques - in this case, Scrum.  The Team:  We started the project with a team of one full-time employee developer, two contract-employee developers, a Product Owner (her theoretical job title is 'project manager', though because we're so understaffed she ended up also being Product Owner, BA, and QA), and the project owner, who is the CIO. We recently (a few months back) also added a senior developer, who works with completely different technologies and has some trouble communicating effectively, into our team to work on certain tasks only she can accomplish - or even fully understand. The developers all work together, in a single cubicle, while the PO and CIO work in a separate building, about a two-minute walk away.  The PO is great, having recently completed a Project-Management-Scrum course before being hired, and the developers were anxious to finally get some sort of project structure, so we've generally got good buy-in from them.  As for the CIO, his opinion was along the lines of 'I don't care how you organize yourselves, just get it done.' This later morphed into slight push-back when he realized how different Agile was from the Waterfall he's used to, but since everyone else in the department strongly dislikes Waterfall, he's mostly backed off - but also remains mostly uninvolved.  Myself:  I am one of the aforementioned contract-employees. I'm also a junior developer... and also the Scrummaster. A strange choice, I realize, but since I'm the only one who's had any actual experience with Scrum, I was pretty much nominated. I'm not a certified Scrummaster by any means, but seeing as we're a year into the project and nothing's on fire yet, I figure things aren't going too badly.  The Problem:  We started out doing Scrum mostly 'by the book' (Scrum from the Trenches, specifically) - daily standup (which consisted of developers), pre-planning meeting (where just the developers hash out the technical details of stories), planning meeting (where the devs estimate the stories with the PO's assistance), demo, retrospective.  However, for the daily standup, demo, and retrospective, interest quickly waned.  There were several mild complaints about the daily standup - ""Why bother, when we all sit two metres from each other all the time?"" Of note is the fact that neither the PO nor the CIO were present at the daily standups (should they have been?). So over time, as people were late or busy and I'd forget to conduct the meetings, they just sort of got phased out, and we don't do them anymore.  As for the demo, we originally had the CIO involved, but he was worried he'd stifle the project after there were repeated occasions of him mentioning a change and that change not being implemented immediately - leading to him mistakenly believing that we wanted him to stop providing feedback, so he stopped attending fairly early. Several months after that, it was decided that we needed to start having Quality Assurance... despite not having a QA. So the PO got roped into becoming the QA. And so, since she had already gone over every single story during the QA process, she considered attending the demo to be redundant. After that, the demo pretty quickly got dropped, as focus shifted to completing features over 'wasting' time preparing and implementing a demo that only the developers would see. I've brought up the remaining benefits of the demo (that it's a good form of retrospection, and that it's a useful additional bug-check), and while the other developers agree with me, none of them seem to have any interest in actually putting forth the 5-minutes-of-work-per-story to actually accomplish a demo.  And now, as we near the first milestone, pressure mounts, and stories become increasingly less-well defined (did I mention that our PO is also a BA and a QA?), the retrospective and pre-planning meetings have started falling off as well. I've received much positive feedback about the pre-planning, so I'm sure that will pick back up again once the milestone passes, but I worry the retrospective may end up dead in the water as well. I haven't even bothered attempting to fold the senior developer into the retrospective, since she's well behind schedule and working on a bunch of different projects at once. Should I attempt, regardless? What about the CIO?  While I realize that part of Agile is the ability to modify processes to fit the environment, I worry that these meetings have been erroneously, or at least prematurely, pruned. It's possible that my own lack of understanding of, or inability to convey, the purposes of these meetings has contributed to this.  Should I just accept that these meetings don't fit well into this organization and allow them to disappear? If not, what can I do to improve buy-in for them? Should I request that the PO attend the stand-ups? Can/should I just exercise my 'authority' as Scrummaster to force people to attend these meetings (keeping in mind that I have little formal authority, since my official position is junior developer, not Scrummaster)?  What do I do? "
442,How to determine team size?,Is there any formula to define team size for small project. I had read fibonacci sequence number formula for rating. So can we apply some logic to define teamsize? I mean we have two subprojects in a big project. What is ideal way to distribute manpower? Any reference related to same topic is welcome. 
443,"Would Scrum work for us, even without fully automated CI?","I am technical lead/architect of an internal product in my company. The team used to be 2 members initially including me, the other guy doing both software and hardware design. The customer (another internal team) of our product hired a candidate to work on our product which looked very unusual to me. It should be us who should be hiring to support them...   Recently, customers have heard of Scrum and are very eager to implement this starting in a week. Since their team member is working on our product, he nominated himself to be Scrum Master as he took a course recently. The hardware guy in our team nominated himself to be Product Owner.  To make it clear, there was no evaluation done to see if Scrum fits or not... All their argument was Scrum supports transparency. I am not against it, but I would like to see if it really fits or not. At the moment, we do daily catch-ups to see who is doing what and hold customer meetings every week. We have a release cycle of 2 weeks, but we don't have a fully automated continuous integration system (CI) yet. I take care of making builds and releases manually. It takes half a day for me at the moment including verification of releases. Although we do bits and pieces of Scrum, I am not convinced that we have to do Scrum...  As I understand, for Scrum to be effective, having CI is very much essential including running some integration testing... Is my understand correct?   How do the roles work in this case? Is the Scrum Master part of the customer team itself?  And what is my role in the case of a technical architect? "
444,"What to do if you do not ""like"" work produced by a freelancer","I have a situation I am not quite sure how to handle.  We have asked a freelancer to come up with some designs for a piece of e-learning. Now, as part of the quote he did some concepts which were part of the pitch so not charge for, however he missed a couple of key points I mentioned in the Brief (unfortunately it was an informal discussion instead of a brief, so I can forgive him that). I am not keen on the look'n'feel anyway, and some of the concepts in the pitch.  Now, I like some of his other stuff, and the design isn't bad, its just not good enough. So, I am thinking of asking him to produce a couple more - and pay him for them, BUT what If we do not like them again? Is that tough cookies? How do you handle this. I realize design is extremely subjective, but I know what I want and I know what makes a good looking usable website.  In general, what do you do if you do not like a piece of design you are paying for? If it was code - you wouldn't pay for something that didn't work.  I did think about posting on the Graphic Designer Stack, however I could predict their answers :)  Thanks guys! "
445,Is it the responsibility of a PM to terminate a failed project?,"I'm not talking about the project closing process.  Is it the responsibility of a project manager to recommend to senior leadership or the customer to prematurely terminate a project with no reasonable chance of success?  Should this decision be made only by the project sponsor?  What does the PM do in the case of a difference of opinion?  Assuming that the project is failing for reasons beyond the control of the PM, how does one terminate the project without also terminating your career? "
446,What is needed to become a robotic team/startup leader?,"Let's consider we want to create a complete robot like Nao(or even ASIMO), that has intelligence(machine vision, speech recognition), and robust electronics/mechanics parts. And we know each of these fields are a special expertise. Even I think in AI field for example, machine vision and speech recognition are two separate professions!  So, maybe it's impossible to consider someone is expert in all of them! It seems a person can only be an expert in only one of them(maybe two?!).  MY MAIN QUESTION: Considering what I said above, WHO CAN BECOME A LEADER OF A TEAM/STARTUP TO BUILD SUCH GREAT ROBOT? I mean what knowledge/skills should he/she has?  Also, what is the least team member requirements to create such product? I mean what people with what knowledge/skills are needed to become a part of that team? "
447,What is the Procedure for Handling a Team Where Two Members Might be Dating?,"Some companies have policies where people may date but that the two individuals can't be working in the same department or be in a supervisor/subordinate relationship.  But with projects, you often see situations where cross-functional and/or self-organizing teams are created to solve a series of different problems.  Sometimes these teams last indefinitely.  If you, as a project manager, suspect that two members of your team may be in a relationship, should this be something you should be concerned with?  Risk can appear in many forms, and management finding out about the relationship could cause you to lose one or both of your team members.  Additionally, if the relationship were to end, that could cause a team dynamic issue if the two members are unable to work together.  Is this something one should be concerned with?  How would you handle this scenario?  What is the proper procedure for handling this situation? "
448,Scrum backlog and sprint planning,"So from what I've understand by reading the tutorials on the Atlasian website, the backlog is populated by the project manager and can contain entries as abstract as he wants, with various degrees of importance. The backlog can (and should) constantly change to reflect the needs of the market and the feedback the product receives. At sprint planning, the team looks at the backlog, discusses the issues, tries to estimate them (either with story points, time or whatever the team likes). The team picks from the backlog what should be done in this sprint (taking into account that degree of importance set by the manager). Further changes to the backlog will not affect this sprint. Am I right? It seems like I'm missing something. Should the team go through everything in the backlog and try to give rough estimates? Or stop when it feels like it should stop? This part is unclear to me. How exactly is the team pulling work from the backlog into the sprint? "
449,"Should every WBS item map to a single ""charge number""?","Assuming you are running projects where every employee submits their time in a corporate accounting system like SAP or Deltek, should every project always define charge numbers for every WBS item?

452,What can I do when my boss has no project plan and the structure of application changes systematically?,When boss tells you to make changes in the pre-production system and he/she doesn't know that to make these changes. Each change causes several problems because you have to change the database and system structure in other modules. This repeats every three or four days systematically and there is no project plan. Is this normal or my boss has not enough experience in project management? What can I do? 
453,"Currently taking a PM class based around PMBOK, doesn't it seem quite inefficient?","It seems terribly obscure, long winded, over complicated, and wreaks of unnecessary overhead. Is this stuff really in use? If so, there has GOT to be a better way to get things done. This PMBOK stuff could cause a lot of waste in terms of both time and staffing resources for a business, as far as I can tell.  Is this really a current standard?  Any pros care to share some real world experience to a student who seems to have stumbled across a terribly inefficient looking set of guidelines? "
454,"Git ""trunk""/""releases"" by customer by product","I have been using SVN for a long time and now I am moving to git just to be ""in fashion"".  My trouble is how git project managers/software developers manage the versions of a program: not from the code's perspective, but instead from the customer's perspective.  I have a few projects that each belong to a customer. Each customer under a separate folder has a ""projects"" folder and possibly a ""support"" folder. The code of the project exists under each ""projects"" folder. Under ""support"" is some supportive documentation/scripts etc.  There is also the case where some clients share a product. Each of those are versions in terms of code or configuration. But it is of the same product.  Now, just trying to do that on the hard disk, I am stuck in that I have the .git under each project. Not under a customer folder. I don't like it, as I guess that this means I need to have a wiki (or a text file?) to remember(!) where the git repositories belong (for example, if a laptop goes busted... and I need to get all the git repositories. I have to have somehow get the repositories back on the disk).  On the other hand would it be better to have the git repository under the customer folder? But in that case, if I need to do ""stash/branch/merge"" would this ""harm"" the rest of the projects under the same ""customer-umbrella-git"" directory?  I can not imagine what would be stashed/merged/branched if one customer needs feature X for product Y and at the same time I need to fix a bug for project B. Having the git repositories under the customer's folder scares me.  Or is there a way to put a git property perhaps somewhere and eclipse/idea/windows explorer ( yeah sure...) would read this and give me a quick acknowledgement of what projects I have under what customer?  How do you manage this? "
455,How to deal with chaotic stakeholder who is high in pecking order?,"Consider you run a project where a key stakeholder is one of VPs. She is a typical hit-and-run type of person: she comes to a project team with half-baked idea, either refuses to discuss details because they're confidential or just throws some anecdote as a business story and expects everyone would start working on a project, whatever that might be.  To make things worse from time to time she bypass project leaders and just tell people what they have to do, no matter how disconnected it is with any project plan which was prepared.  Because of hierarchy she can't be ignored as the project team works under her. Also standard methods, e.g. trying to set some formal rules, don't work as she just ignore any arrangements she doesn't like.  How to deal with that kind of person? How to bring some order to the project?  Or maybe it's best option just to accept how the things look like? "
456,Benchmarking robotic systems,"First of all, what does benchmarking robotic systems include?  Because, while searching the internet, I came across 2 different definitions. The first one included the state and comparison of different systems on the market. The second included defining a set of tests, measures and tasks to qualify the system's performance.  Which is the right definition? To start a successful benchmarking, what steps should be followed?  Any advice or reference should be a great help. "
457,How can you avoid to over-talk topics and just keep the workflow going?,"In my company we have this computer guys who always fix the system and add new features. My task in this process is to divide the workload among the developers and to get status updates to the higher-ups (How is it going?, When are we going to finish this project?, and so on...).  Always when I bring a new requirement to the nerds (sorry for my wording but it will soon become clear why I call them like that) downstairs they freak out and over-talk everything. The will say that some things don't work this way or that they have to set up a separate system or some excuses like that. I am looking for project management tools where I just write down what they have to do and they will get the appropiate work assigned, prefered automatically. I don't want to waste my time talking to this eggheads but instead get my and the company's work done. Less 'yada yada', more working.

I would like to simulate a number of scenario's related to the planning sequence of these work packages eg when I do them all in sequence, where would I end up. What happens if I do two of them in parallel. The purpose is to create a release plan (or a number of possible release plans) to discuss with business.  What would be a good method or tool to do this? Excel is my friend at the moment, using cumulative numbers.

Have you seen anyone do something awesome in a meeting that wasn't borderline cheesy? I need to demonstrate imagination but also an ability to drive and get things done. Links or videos appreciated as well. Help me get this job! "
461,At what point should a company decide to introduce a project manager role?,"What criteria should a software company use to decide if they need to introduce a project management role into their team?  From what I have seen, most companies start out with no project managers, and large corporations are usually full of them.    What happens in between to make that transition necessary? "
462,How to calculate budget margin?,"Say a work package (containing several tasks) is estimated to take between 320 (Most likely) and 480 (Worst case) hours of work (not duration) to complete. Because of some dependencies and the schedule and budget risk involved, you think it is wise to add an intermediate buffer at the end of this work package, besides an overal margin at the end of the project.   How do you determine or calculate this individual work package margin?  Do you use:   2 x the standard deviation, as proposed by Mike Cohn in his book ""Agile planning and Estimating"", chapter 17. PERT (in that case you also need an optimistic estimate): calculating the expected value for the schedule and a 2 x standard deviation for the margin Just the difference between the Most Likely and the average of the two Monte Carlo simulation, but this calculates schedule margin for the whole project. How can I determine which intermediate margins to use?  Any other formula   And what would be your justification for the proposed method? And your success rate ;-)  Thanks "
463,2 years of Dev Experience to a Project Manager,"I have a 2 years of .NET experience in enterprise architecture. Plus I hold a Masters Degree in Management (Not MBA, 1st yr of MBA). Now I am moving to a software consulting company of less than 50 employees as PM.   What should I do (reading books/blogs etc.) to try to become a successful PM. Is this move logical? I know I cannot see myself as an architect after 5 years.   Any Advices? "
464,Is it possible to over-communicate in project team?,Communication issues in projects are very common. Often the advice we give others or get from others is to communicate more and to be more transparent and most of the time it works.  The question is how far we should go with this approach? Is it possible to over-communicate in project? Do you know situations where communication became a problem not because it wasn't sufficient but because there was too much of it? 
465,MBA vs PMP to prepare for shifting to Management Career,"I am wondering for a person who wants to advance his career from the development to management level in IT sector, what will provide him the suitable foundation or knowledge for him?  MBA or PMP ?  What will be the best choice for him to prepare for his upcoming career? "
466,how to calculate sprint capacity?,"Lets say team works 5 days, and there are 3 developers in team, and they are working 8 hours per day. So actually it is easy to calculate : 5*3*8= 120 hours of work for per week.  But there is something missing : there is no time for testing and code review process at the last day of sprint. Because it takes some time to test sprint items and friday night (last day of sprint) works cannot be send to done.  So for agile prenciples, how should i calculate sprint capacity? should i estimate it for 4 days ? if so, what should developer do in last day ? "
467,Managing projects across time zones,"When managing a project that involves participants across the globe, it is quite manageable for any two timezones to meet (someone will be at the end of their shift while someone is starting theirs), but add in a 3rd timezone, and someone is going to have an 11 PM call.  Are there any practices you have found to work well? The solutions I have seen so far are:    Having the project manager take the hit and schedule meetings that work for the time zones of the project participants.  The project manager is then a zombie during their shift. Schedule a recurring early-morning meeting (to meet with, say, the European particpants, and a recurring late afternoon meeting (to meet with folks in Asia).  Twice the meetings! Have one meeting, but rotate the time so that every 3rd meeting, folks in a given region have the meeting way past bedtime. Make the region with the fewest participants take the hit   What has worked well for you? "
468,Agile for Web Development,"1) Can anyone recommend a resource that correlates Agile terms (Epic, Feature, User Story) with the web development process?  2) I understand the concept of waterfall development, but what is it called if things are done in parallel (that aren't co-dependent) -> ""While Jim works on the mockup, Mary is going to gather content, and Charlie is going to setup the test server). Would those tasks be Agile because they are done in parallel?  Thanks!  "
469,Version Control for Microsoft Project files,"In software it is a best practice to store the source code in Version Control software (also called VC, Configuration Management or CM, SCM for Software CM). This lets one go back and look at 1) changes to the code 2) prior versions of the code.  Since Microsoft Project files aren't text files, doing this directly doesn't help with looking at changes. Is there a good way to do this? I'm thinking perhaps export the project in a text format that can be compared.  EDIT: my goal is to answer questions such as ""When did that used to be due?"" and ""That seemed to have changed; did I add or delete a dependancy"" "
470,Is there a difference between use case and user stories?,Is there any difference between use case and user stories?  Or are these totally different terms in the context of agile planning? 
471,What is the main factor that makes your project not meet its goals most of the time?,"What is the most common problem you face regularly and how you can avoid it?   I wonder if we, as a community, will agree on the same thing?  I ask for some short answers (just in a few words) to share our experience. "
472,Managing your dissertation,I am to write a doctoral dissertation but struggling with achieving results in time.   What project management can teach me on doing a project on my own? What should I read?  My area is computer science if that matters. 
473,metrics for bug fixing / learning legacy system,"We are a new team of about a dozen developers in our not-very-IT company tasked with reshoring/onshoring/insourcing (bringing into the company what a vendor has developed for us) a large (10M+ LOC?) legacy system. With pretty much zero documentation the approach we are taking is just to work on bug fixes as a way to learn more about the system.  Our management wants to keep track of our progress so they are counting the number of bug report tickets we've closed, which does not seem to be helping. Rather than addressing the highest risk vulnerabilities, the developers are focusing on finding the simplest bugs to fix while avoiding any in-depth troubleshooting.  What could be a better metric for us? There is an opinion that story points are more about new features and they do not really work well for defects, especially since we cannot really know the complexity of these in advance.  Maybe we need not a new metric but a new approach altogether. "
474,MS Project with Sub-Projects,"We are using MS Project 2010 to manage our projects. We have a subcontractor that works on the same project. They report differently within their company than we do.  So, we had him break apart his schedule so that we could bring them in as four small chunks in the appropriate places in our schedule. The problem is that no matter what % complete the subcontractor schedules report, it does not impact the overall % complete.   This seems incredibly counterintuitive. How should we fix this issue? Is it even an issue at all? If not, how do we handle this? "
475,How can we successfully introduce Test Driven Development(TDD)?,My team needs to successfully implement Test Driven Development (TDD). Which techniques have you found successful in making the cultural shift from traditional development to TDD? And what checks and balances should we put in place to ensure ongoing success? 
476,Are Functional Managers or Project Managers Better Candidates for Executive-Level Positions?,"Project Managers work with different skilled workers to meet a specific goal, while Functional Managers manage a specific business unit that may provide services to the project manager.    Based on the answers in the question, What are the fundamental differences between a functional manager and a project manager and is it possible to switch between the two?, the Project Manager may deal with several different business units, such as development, marketing, sales, business development, and many more.  On the other hand, a Functional Manager is responsible for the ongoing success of a specific business unit.  In terms of career growth, which position is more likely to help someone move into an executive-level position? "
477,"Employees, training, domain knowledge, and the big picture","The problem: As an employee in a big organization, I frequently experience the uncertainties associated with a general lack of domain knowledge and understanding of the big picture and the wider company processes that are beyond an individual's assignment as a software developer.  The question: Do companies generally speaking have the mindset that it is better spending time up-front training employees and providing them with a birds-eye view of the company processes and the required domain knowledge given the application domain the employee will be working on?  Based on my experience with big companies, apparently it is a common accepted practice to just drop an employee in a ""sea of unknowns"" so that it is the employee itself who finds all answers as needed, no matter the level of stress and the lack of productivity that it entails.  What are we talking about here? Is this simply that when organizations are so large things get out of control and there is no other way of operation? Or are we talking about Need-to-Know basis? Or is it simply that from a cost perspective it is accepted that is just too expensive to train every employee that comes into an organization?  I am of the school that spending time up front, providing domain knowledge, and giving employees birds-eye view of companies processes are worth the expenditure. I wanted to get opinions from other project managers that maybe have better insights than me. Thank you. "
478,What are good steps for getting guidance to become a project manager?,"I'm currently active as a project leader (under a project manager) on a project at the European Commission.  I've literally asked my PM to guide me, let me know what I could do to improve etc.  What would you recommend to do for getting good guidance?  The broader perspective of this question is:   What do you recommend to do if you are a junior Project Leader to learn the tricks of the job and eventually, in a few years, get the status of PM?  For example: He told me to follow training on PM, go to conferences in the next months... "
479,What are most typical iconic examples of a poor project management?,"Can you give examples of projects that failed due to their project management mistakes? Would be nice to have some internal details about ""why?"" and ""how?"". "
480,How to move from the Business area of PM to a more IT system related projects?,"I am a PRINCE2 Practitioner with a strong Business Administration and Economics background. In my years as a PM, I have always been responsible for projects focused on the Business User area and final client. I must admit that I have found these projects very enjoyable because they connect you to the real users.  Nonetheless, I have developed a strong interest in Object-Oriented projects and Business Intelligence, and I would like to roll out my experience in projects of this kind.  I have learned a lot liaising with IT and trained on different methodologies but, unfortunately, my CV still lacks of experience. How could I transition into the IT area? What are the key requirements or steps that I could take to support my development? "
481,Discerning estimate validity,"I've had experiences in the past where different developers will give different qualities of estimates--which then have to be consolidated into a single project plan--only with a twist.    One developer will look at a task, figure it sounds like an easy problem, and estimate a couple of hours. Another developer will look at a task, figure it sounds easy, but recognize that there could be additional complexity or clarification along the way, so planning for contingencies, estimate a week. A third developer doesn't want to do the task and in an effort to discourage its inclusion (or his assignment to it), will estimate a month.   How does one go about discerning which estimates fall into which category? Do you just go by feel?  "
482,How do you create innovation on your projects?,"With most projects focused on meeting requirements within specific constraints, how do you create innovative solutions on a project?  From a portfolio management approach, how do you encourage innovative projects and get them funded? "
483,Basis of Estimate,"Some consider the BOE the most important part of an estimate. How do you know that, when you write one, you hit the necessary aspects that brings confidence to the reader that the estimate is sound?   What makes a quality Basis of Estimate?  What gets included, what gets excluded?  "
484,How to link Scrum release backlog to conventional project plan (MS project) in keeping sprint benefits?,"We use the Scrum methodology for our software development. Since software development isn't the core activity of our company, and since this company isn't agile methods oriented yet, I need, as the ScrumMaster, to provide an interface between the Scrum methodology and the company.  The top management asks me to maintain a classic project plan, using MS Project, at mid-term (6 months), with resources defined, etc...  My question is: How can I provide a useful project plan for my top management while keeping all the flexibility and agility of my team in the daily organisation and operation, and also stay Scrum compliant?!  For me, defining resources in the project plan removes a lot of benefits of sprint concepts, right? "
485,What should you do if the project manager is so 'bad' that you end up managing the project yourself?,"I have a situation where a project is in progress, and the project manager does not seem to be doing his job. This is a high profile project within the company, and has a very definite finish date. The project has been running for a couple of months now, but more and more I am having to intervene to ensure the correct management processes are being empolyed to ensure that the project stays on track. Examples of this are ensuring communication is maintained constantly within the project team, ensuring the deliverables are still on track taking the necessary escalation steps if otherwise, and so on.   Is it acceptable to go above the project managers head and report his adequacies? Or should I be providing him with more support? "
486,How to neutralize negative project stakeholders?,"There are positive and negative stakeholders in every project (according to PMBOK). Positive ones will benefit from project implementation, for example their work will become more effective, more automated, easier, and more fun. At the same time negative stakeholders will have problems once the project is implemented. For example, they will be fired because their job will be done by new software.  It's a project manager responsibility to take negative stakeholders into account and neutralize their influence to the project affairs. How do you do this in your real-life projects? What are the most effective methods? "
487,Are there any wrong methods when selecting a team?,"When selecting a team do you think it’s beneficial to use information collated from exercises such as Honey &amp; Mumford – Learning Style Questionnaires?   Furthermore, would you encourage team/individual exercises like this in an existing team with the intention to strengthen and improve working style? "
488,How do you convince a client to use Agile Methods?,"Here's the thing: In agile, client has very important role to fulfill - if they aren't involved, agile loses much of its value.  How do you convince clients to change the way they run projects, especially with big companies and at least medium-sized projects?  I guess they don't just believe salesperson saying ""that's better."" And if they don't have much experience working the agile way, clients are likely to be reluctant. So how you make them to change their minds? "
489,How to improve the team-work?,"Recently our team was informed that they will be joined to another team.  We work in a big system and there are several subsystems that demand specific competencies, currently we have:   Team-A --> competence-A Team-B --> competence-B   Our project manager asked us to follow a rule at the beginning:  Tasks with competence-A will be handled by Team-B and vice-versa and then we will have:   Team-A --> competence-B Team-B --> competence-A   The team will have to self-organize to give support to each other and help on competence build-up.  The only way I see this plan happening successfully is with a strong team-work, organization and internal communication.  The pain points are:   How to build-up this team-work to make things happen naturally? What is the best approach/methodology to this issue? (currently we are working with a pragmatic Scrum (we call it ""Scrumban"", see little more here)   I was wondering whether some external activities with the people to make them work together would improve the team-work, communication and create a friendship between them.  Additional info:   90%-80% of the people are seniors and everybody is engaged to the project. We will keep metrics separated for a couple of months. After a couple of months we want to have a completely joined team (Team-C with competence A and B). Meetings between Team-A and Team-b already started to allying some process handling differences. Both teams are co-located.  "
490,First time scrummaster - need to create product backlog and set up work,"I am certified scrum master but never practiced until tomorrow when I have been appointed as a ScrumMaster to a pilot initiative in the company to implement scrum in a team of non-software and non project but daily activity. I let you imagine all the politics around this decision.  The work will start on 1st of August, and the product owner has set up a meeting tomorrow to create the product backlog with me and another person, which will not be part of the team.   My questions:   Who should propose the structure of the product backlog tomorrow (me or the PO)? Should we create directly user stories with the product owner? I have a one hour meeting, and in my understanding is that I need more than that? what is your suggestion on how to proceed?   I know all the theory but I miss the very practical steps to start.  Here is more information:   Department: product development (non IT products). Team: 7 people. Product owner: is the manager of the department (the 7 people in the team are his team). ScrumMaster: I do not belong to the team nor to the department; I am working as staff function. Beginning of the work: 1st of August (but as you see in the question the PO wants to create the product backlog with me tomorrow (45 days in advance). Company: 100 years old, 25k employees, always used Waterfall methodology only 3-4 scrum initiatives ongoing in small IT projects (budget less than 500k €).  "
491,MS Project: Scenario planning issue,"Relatively new to MS Project and have come across an issue, I've searched through threads to see if I could see anything similar without luck, so apologies if this has been covered previously.  The base scenario is that I've produced a high level schedule with activities and durations (in days) without resources or work inputs. A key stakeholder wants to understand scenario planning options.   My base case intention was for 10-hour days, so each entry of 1 day would be equivalent to 10 hours (even though I didn't change the working time in calendars).  My second case is to switch from day shift to night shift which would essentially have the same number of hours, however I wanted to add in 20% contingency. I couldn't figure out a blanket way to attack this, so I just increased all the durations by 20% (i.e. 2 days is now 2.4 days). I don't quite think this worked perfectly, either. (Anyone care to weigh in?)  My third case is working 6-hour days instead of 10-hour days, to determine the impact it has on the final construction completion date.   My hope, misguided as it may be, was that I could have my base plan at 10-hour days (changing a few options and calendars in the base plan), and then simply modify the working hours / calendar to spit out my other scenarios.  If I did change the calendar to 10-hour days, Monday to Friday, the durations for each activity would change from 1 day to 0.8 days. Is there something I need to change in task type, or do I need to re-enter all values? I even tried changing duration to hours and entering 10 hours after modifying calendar and it pushed 1 day activities into the next day ... unsure why.   Any suggestions on how to tackle this in the most appropriate way? Is it possible without assigning resources and work efforts etc?  "
492,How to make sure a task assignment was clear?,"I guess you know the situation, that with some of your colleagues you manage to establish a common way of communication right away (whatever you talk about is understood perfectly by the other one), whereas with others it takes a while or maybe never gets established.  I understand that to a large extent that's related to communication skills in general, but I think it is particularly important when you as a project manager assign tasks.  You explain the overall objective, how this fits into the overall project, within which time the results are expected, maybe give indications how you think this can be solved, and your colleague agrees and indicates everything was well understood (which may or may not be true).  What seems to me very important in that regard, is that just because of fear of not being understood to start micro-managing.  So which possibilities come to your mind how to make sure that you managed to express yourself understandably? How do you deal with people that, for whatever reasons, would not come back with questions for clarification to you and rather spend a day or even week on something that does not contribute to the overall progress? "
493,Is it possible to use Rita's and Andy Crowe's books to prepare for the CAPM exam?,"I've bought the two books mentioned above to prepare for the PMP exam until I have the required conditions (3+ years of PM work) fulfilled.   I've recently had a look at the CAPM exam however, and thought it can't really hurt to sit another test.   My question is this: Can I use the two book I have to prepare for CAPM? I.e. Is CAPM's syllabus a subset of PMP's?  EDIT: Those books I mentioned are the two best-selling PMP preparation Books. Those are :   The PMP Exam: How to Pass on your First Try :Crowe, Andy PMP Exam Prep, Seventh Edition: Rita's Course in a Book for Passing the PMP Exam: Mulcahy, Rita  "
494,Manager 2.0 and Scrum: How can I fix the problem where multiple managers are responsible for different scrum team components?,"I just read this article, Manager 2.0: The Role of a Manager in Scrum.   I am a scrummaster, and as the teams go, my team is made of both developers and QE. QE has its own manager (I am also the development manager), which essentially means someone else can still assign work for QE in my team.   They can still say what can or cannot be done and in which way. Which means it essentially causes disturbance. Is there a way out? One way I could think of was to have one manager responsible for entire team (Development and QE), but I don't know whether that was the right approach.   How can I fix the problem where multiple managers are responsible for different scrum team components? "
495,Is backlog refinement (grooming) waste?,"So, I have seen it happening, especially with online tools: The backlog grows till you don't see the forest for trees, important features drowns in a sea of issues, and duplicates appear because it is too heard to keep track of what is in the backlog.  Backlog grooming refinement to the rescue, and it seems to be an undisputed best practice. But I see it more as a cure for symptoms rather than cause. Beside, while time spent grooming refinement the backlog could save time elsewhere, the time is still not a value adding activity. Wouldn't it be a better approach to prevent the grooming refinement? That is, are there practices to follow that reduce the need to spend time on grooming refinement?  (I think I read something on this subject in a blog post or article. Can't find it though, so if anybody knows please tell.) "
496,"Title/subject formalism in bug reports (standardising bug naming only): I was <context>, I did <action>, I got <actual behaviour>","Intro  We use different formalisms in titles/subjects for different purposes (story, feature, test), but we have no formalism for bug reports...  We are investigating the advantages of a standardised title format for bugs.  Different formalisms for titles/*subjects* in use, practically  We use with quite a success these formalisms in titles/*subjects* .  Story title  For Scrum stories, we use the following title formalism:  As a &lt;role&gt;, I want &lt;goal/desire&gt; so that &lt;benefit&gt;   Feature title  For FDD (Feature-Driven Development) features, we use the following title formalism:  &lt;action&gt; the &lt;result&gt; &lt;by|for|of|to&gt; a(n) &lt;object&gt;   Tests formalism  For Acceptance Tests (behaviour), we use the following formalism:  GIVEN THAT &lt;conditions&gt;/&lt;initial state&gt;/&lt;context&gt; (no action) WHEN &lt;actions&gt; (performed by user) THEN &lt;expected results&gt;/&lt;consequences&gt; (that the system does)   Looking for a bug title formalism  Title/subject formalism  For bug reports, we think we are going to adopt a title formalism close to:  I was &lt;context&gt;, I did &lt;action&gt;, I got &lt;actual behaviour&gt;   I only focus here on the title, not the full description!  Advantages:   homogeneity across teams (when bugs needs to be passed over) strictness for better description and understanding mapping of:  the bug's 'context' to the acceptance test's 'context' the bug's 'actual behaviour' to the acceptance test's 'expected results'    Disadvantages:   it is a change to introduce, document, promote, and followup in the project you name it   Guidelines for the title/subject  But this formalism is not enough for just a title, as it may need a few guidelines:   should be as short as possible do not mention a technical component or feature, as the guess and confirmation is part of the investigation and not the purpose of the creation of the bug do not make any assumption or guess just basically describe as briefly as possible the context, action, and actual behaviour, because anyway it will be detailed in the full description do not not add any markup like [stuff] or (thing), because it hinders the reading do not add any team-specific keywords, as a bug is supposed to be passed from team to team do not try to solve the issue at the reporting phase, it is the task of the assignee bring the right balance/dichotomy between barely perimetered issue, and fully understood, as in one hand it is too vague, and on the other hand the resolution is almost finished stay meaningful    Full description (not the goal of this post)  Of course, this is not the goal of this post, but in the full description of the bug free text), there will be:   Context Steps to reproduce Actual behaviour Expected results Optionnally  links to docs logs diagrams screenshots ...    With all the fields of the bug tracker software, like affected/fix versions, severity, priority, links to other tickets, etc.  But this is not the subject of this post...  Let's get back to the bug titles/*subjects*.  Open questions on bug titles   Do you think it is worth to put up such a title/*subject* formalism in place? How do you name you bugs? (how you fully describe and manage bugs is not the goal of this discussion)  "
497,Method for assessing risk in a release,"I have been tasked to develop a metrics program specifically designed to look at how risky a release is from a code base volatility perspective.  The director requesting this information is working from the assumption that more change to the overall code base later in the release cycle (percentage wise) increases risk.  It seems a reasonable assumption but I would like to numerically justify it before we start reporting it to the development teams on a regular basis.  My rough (very rough) plan at this point centers around a few data points.   Quality data:  Review production defects/incidents and tie them to release X (where possible) Quality data 2:  Review pre-production, test cycle defects tied to release X Change/Quantity data:  Review code volatility numbers either at the file level or by # of changes per application.  I am having trouble locking down the best quantity measurement to use...lines of code seems to detailed and reviewing by change list seems too broad so I am thinking somewhere in-between.    Questions:   Does this plan create a system that can help evaluate risk at the release level?   Are there other measures I have not considered that should be included?  "
498,Feature Team Cross Dependencies,"We in the midst of a conversion to Agile/Scrum, using Agile Software Requirements as a general manual.  We've traditionally broken our teams up into component teams.  One team does API/Service work while another does UI implementation.  Mix in a team of testers and after quite a few years of this, a bit of a rift has grown between the teams.  We've organized into back office and front office teams.  One team being in charge of building from top to bottom the customer facing part, while the other handles the back office billing/sales systems.  The problem is twofold.  We have certain services that are consumed by both of the teams.  So, we also formed a component group that's in charge of maintaining these global services.  This creates inter-team dependencies, kind of contrary to the concept of a feature team.  The other problem is that the front office applications have to call into the back office applications to see if a customer has purchased a subscription to Product X.  Again, another cross team dependency.  It's impossible for us to bring Product Y to market without backoffice billing support and the management of the product in our customer facing portal.  To solve the dilemma, we changed who the component group considers as a customer.  Instead of a fully end user testable feature with a UI, the APIs themselves have to be approved of by the teams that consume them.  Thus, kind of making them a feature team as well, just without a UI.  The back/front office teams become the customer/stakeholders.  Is this logic sound?  Can I get a sanity check on this? "
499,How can new project managers avoid the pressure of creating schedules that meet deadlines but are not realistic?,"I can see some project managers who worked as engineers and programmers in the past suddenly device impractical and insane plans when they become managers. Do they lose sanity even after worked so many years as engineers and programmers??  Do some stop thinking in programmers shoes when they become managers even though they were programmers for more than a decade,.? "
500,How Can I Obtain a Project Management Position With No Professional Experience In The Field?,"I am still a student. My formation and my personal thirst for knowledge led me to learn a lot of different things:   Programming experience in several languages (low level ASM to higher level JAVA) Professional experience as network/sys admin Participed in SCRUM like projects for 4 years 1 year teaching experience in network and programming Self taught: security, project management   What I want to highlight here is that I have a variety of knowledge and experience that I would like to use in real life to the fullest. The problem is this: Before getting to any project management interesting position, I am expected to have some years of professional experience in the same field.  My goal is to get to a position where I can use all of these skills, learn and face challenges, and without passing by the coder phase. I don't want to do something that any coder can do, I want to be able to express myself and supervise others.  What to do in order to achieve this goal? I need a fast and efficient solution. What career path to follow and what competence do I need to acquire now? I am really willing to learn anything that can lead me there, I just despise doing something that I know I can do (coding, maintenance, ...), it would kill my motivation.  Thank you for helping me make a very important decision.  PS: I am sorry if I am off topic, I think this is the best choice to ask here since you may relate to my story and help me with your experience as project manager. Project manager is not the only job that would motivate me though, but you might be able to help me still.  EDIT: I really appreciate all of your answers, you seem to have so much to say about it and every bit of information is precious to me. Thank you !  EDIT2: I earned a badge through this question and I would like to add a few more details on my new experience and how I can relate to the answers given.  I accepted David's answer because it matches perfectly what I experienced for the past 2 years. Managing projects is a big word, well it was, I used to be the shadow guy who actually articulated a few key projects following rough guidelines from my manager. We actually worked hand in hand, splitting tasks and raising issues to each others as the project went on. Although he is a PMP, we had no time to actually plan and execute the project, we had to dive in something new and deliver quickly. It involved training of frontend/backend teams (finance, sales, IT, Support, etc.), adjusting the systems, ordering improvements, raising bug defects, testing, etc.  All this to say, my way into PM was that of necessity, I helped until I became an unofficial PM and as I write this now I am leading alone a project scaling on several countries. Visibility and recognition happens naturally as we interact with our colleagues and communicate on achievements. I feel much more involved and I am deploying my own vision for the direction to take from now on many fronts.  What does it take for going to PM? To me: - Competent HR and managers - Impeccable and accurate communication - Dedication, passion and hard work - Commitment to the success of the company - Curiosity and engaging everybody - Deliver and be ""Impactful"" (>relevant, >successful) - Communicate during reviews with your management your will to evolve - Stay very well organized, empower yourself (OneNote, Outlook rules/config, Excel skills, presentation skills, organization methods, etc)  I look back and feel that I was too focused on my own job and on my own technology to evolve in my previous job. I came to this one with an open mind, a learner mind and my curiosity made me a candidate for the internal leadership program in HR to groom future leaders of our company. I am continuing my road with great achievements and rewards. Thanks again to all who answered here, this helped me go through that process and grow. "
501,How to prevent deliberate long estimation?,"There is a team and a PM. Unfortunately, the PM does not have very strong technical skills, therefore he has no basis for estimation of the time and costs which are required for each part of project.  In this situation other personnel (e.g. Programmers' Team Lead) must provide the estimation. But, what will happen if these personnel provide an incorrect  estimation? For example, padding the estimates to reduce pressure on delivery timescales?  What can PM do to find the right estimates? "
502,"How QA, Frontend, Backend development, and System administration fit in Scrum Management Framework","We are a small start-up that is growing fast.  We have 4 departments: (Backend dev [2 pers], Frontend dev [2 pers], QA [2 pers], and one system administrator)  Before using Scrum methodology, we didn't have a clear idea about our progress, what others are working on, etc. Now we passed this issue, but we face a big issue now; it seems that the team is not conformable with the current methodology.  To give you a clear view on our case, here is how we proceed to handle a project:  We have a backlog meeting with product owner. The team defines the release backlog in another meeting (basing it on priority set by the product owner) Each department slices the release backlog and lists all tasks needed to be done by the next sprint. For instance, the backend group will start working on an API, front end will deal with designers and get the ready templates ready, the QA team will read and understand stories, and system administrators need to define the next priority according to the current project.  Each department creates their own sprint. (It's weird I know :s) and in the end we have 5 sprints. (The 5th one is for business employers. Well, they want to be part of the methodology, lol.)  Before we start using Scrum, we were respecting a cycle of two weeks, and after implementing Scrum, the project manager suggest that sprints need be done in two weeks. However, we just found that a sprint may take more :s.  According to our case, I have a list of question coming to my head.  Do QA, Backend, Frontend, and System Administration fit in Scrum methodology? What can we do if QA and system administration has a daily tasks? Can we use just one Sprint instead of 5? "
503,Does the team estimate time for tasks or stories or both?,"During the sprint planning meeting, does the team estimate time for each story, or the tasks that make up the story? Then which is tracked by the team/scrum master?  I assume the team estimates the time for the tasks that make up a story, then the story is the sum of the tasks.The burndown chart (if based on time) is based on the time left for stories...  Is this correct? "
504,How to handle epics in Kanban?,"We are about to start working with Kanban instead of Scrum for our product development. We have identified that we will ahve the following flow:  Backlog -> Analyze -> Development - Test  Nothing strange there. For stories that are small from the beginning there is no problem. But what happens when we have epics and in Analyze split that story? Some sub-stories will move to the Development but some might go back to the backlog. How do we than measure lead-time when we are moving some stories forward and some backward?   Another dimenson of the problem is that different stories will have different size and we want to have small stories and than we break them down in small parts. But the stakeholder is more interested in lead-time for the whole story. He want to now that if his epic goes to the Analyze column, how long will it take before the whole epic is complete? "
505,Good idea for a client to also be the project manager?,"A while ago I took on a freelance web programming project with a company I'm already familiar with. My boss (also the company owner) typically pairs me with one of his PM employees for each project I work on, but there was one case that made the exception.  As a freelancer I could work potentially from anywhere with only the obligation to show up on-site for the weekly client meeting, but I usually work in the office because I can concentrate better. When I told my boss that in most cases, I'd rather report to the PM because it's easier and more accessible, that's when he informed me that the client is the PM!  I can see the advantage of having no middleman for the project, but in this case the client/PM was unavailable during most of the week. I would rather wish there was a PM that I can just talk to every day face-to-face to have a better assessment of our short term progress. Plus, the company's own PMs are much more web-literate than the client so they would do a better job at communicating problems and suggestions.   So are there any cases where doubling up the client as a PM would ever be a good idea? If any of you ever faced this situation as someone working for a PM/client, how did you handle it? "
506,What to do if team can't be made cross-functional?,"I work in a small video game development studio, where the whole company is one team working on one product, and each person has a fixed broad function (e.g. programmer, artist, musician). We can't be cross-functional since the range of functions is very wide - it's not like the typical cases I read about where e.g. ""the database engineer can do a bit of front-end engineering too"" - it's rare to find programmers that have artistic talent and even rarer to find artists that can code at all!  In Kanban, it looks like one recommended way of dealing with this is to have each discipline as a column, and to move stories from e.g. ""In progress - engineering"" to ""In progress - art"" as it progresses, but in video games there's generally there's not a hard dependency between the disciplines (don't need to wait for all of one discipline to be done before the other can work), and if there is, the disciplines will work closely together to iterate on that one task/story, so pipelining it like this doesn't make sense to me.  In Scrum, when picking a set of stories to accomplish in one sprint, some sprints will have mostly art-heavy stories queued up, and some sprints will have mostly engineering-heavy stories queued up. By picking the next most important stories, we'd be committing to having some disciplines sat idle once their part is done, since as I said, artists are unable to move on to engineering tasks.  In both cases, in a small company, any spare capacity can't be moved to other teams, and the hiring process (to increase capacity for some disciplines) is far slower than actual work (and of course, not always possible or desirable).  What I think may be good ideas (though I haven't read anything like this anywhere, hence why I'm asking this question!) are:   For Scrum, fiddle the priorities of stories to account for capacity across disciplines, so rather than take on a second engineering-heavy story, look down the backlog for an art-heavy story, to make sure the sprint contains about the right amount of work for each discipline. This doesn't feel quite right because it means we're not always working on the most important story. For Kanban, have a lane for stories, and a lane for each discipline, pull stories into 'doing' when any discipline starts work on it (and to 'done' once all disciplines are done with it), so each discipline can get a bit ahead if there is spare capacity (but if staffing levels are right, it'll average out over the course of the project). This doesn't feel quite right because the stories lane will need to ignore WIP limits, meaning there will be some waste if things change. Also it just looks messy!   Am I thinking about this in the right way? What do other non-cross-functional teams do? And what's the actual name for non-cross-functional team so I can search for this better?  Thanks! "
507,How can my team reconcile flow and pair-programming?,"For those of you who have read Peopleware, you were probably exposed to the concept of flow. Flow is a mental state attained by creativity workers (engineers, writers, programmers, etc.) which is often described as a state of immersion in which time seems to pass unknowingly and creative work flows from the mind. Throughout Peopleware, there is the recurring concept that to engage in flow, privacy and quiet are the main two ingredients.  On the other hand, I have read a substantial body of research in regards to pair programming (which should be familiar to the XP folks reading this). Pair programming, advocates a two person team which functions as an single organic, programming entity to accomplish a single goal. For those of you not acquainted, this paper should help: [website]So now we have two slightly contradicting ideas in the realm of software PM which proclaim to increase programmer productivity, code quality, and happiness.  My question to you is, are these ideas reconcilable? Is there any research on this topic, or how have you lead your software teams in regard to this?  EDIT:  The closest scheme that I have seen to bridge this particular kind of paradox is that of a combination. Some of the work is done in pair programming, while some of the work is done in private. How to balance this team/individual work seems to me to be the biggest question in regards to this compromise. "
508,How should we implement and keep track of recurring or intangible retrospective action items?,"Our Product/Tech team has been transitioning towards Agile project management in the last year or so, and we hold daily standups, weekly planning meetings and biweekly retrospective meetings. We also use a Kanban board.  As the team's Scrum Master, I've been trying to make the retrospectives more actionable, as some team members have pointed out that we often end up discussing the same issues that don't get solved. I'm worried about the impact of this on team members' morale and desire to participate, so I've tried several approaches to make things more concrete, such as 15% solutions, and limiting the number of action items that we commit to doing to the bare minimum (i.e. 1-2). We've also been adding those items to our Sprint board to give them visibility. This has helped quite a bit with ad hoc, concrete action items.  What I'm struggling with right now is what I call ""intangible"" action items, i.e. items that are linked to habits or behavioural change and/or are recurring in nature. Here are some examples:   When pulling a PBI into Building, take some time to think about how it will be reviewed so that it doesn't create bottlenecks in the Ready to Review column When estimating roadmap items, multiply by 2 so that we provide more realistic estimates During the scoping phase, map out dependencies so that we can plan the work better   I could of course put all of these in a document and share it, but it would probably end up on the proverbial shelf and never get implemented. From my experience, even when these solutions emerge from the team to tackle very real problems, because of their intangible nature, they quickly fall by the wayside when things get busy. Hence my question: How do you make sure those action items get implemented? How do you keep track of them? "
509,Can't build reality tree of undesirable effects as objections are absurd,"I'm attempting to build a future and current reality tree regarding changing policy and procedure to data access, but we're being given undesirable effects that are entirely divorced from reality.  For instance, we're asking for a list of locations for all the fire hydrants in a municipality, and one objection brought up was that if this data is made public then ""we've given vandals the power to find every fire hydrant and destroy them"". Another similar objection was that we can't have real-time tracking of bus data because this will ""empower stalkers to harass and follow people around."".   I deeply, deeply wish these were made up. I really do. I also wish running away from these ""reasons"" was something we could do, or shoving my fingers in my ears screaming ""na na na na poo poo I can't hear you,"" but the fact of the matter is I really need to figure out the genuine UDEs that are causing them to bring up these absurd scenarios. They're scared of something, and I can't make a negotiation or draw a plan that makes both sides happy because they won't actually tell us.  How do I get to the bottom of this and make everyone happy? Is using intuition suitable in this case to try and ""dream up"" their actual UDEs? I find myself painting them as evil or corrupt when I do so, which I know is probably the wrong way to go about this. "
510,Is manuscript (handwritten documentation) used in project management?,"In today's world, is there any place for manuscript documentation?   Can manuscript be used nowadays? Some people still favor paper over digital media, then how to document such things? If developer develops some code then up to which extents documentation should be done? How to store it? In some cases even self explanatory code is hard to understand, then how to properly document it?   Considering attrition in organization, how to keep code and documentation self explanatory so that new programmer easily get it? References to some case studies is welcome. Please give practical examples instead of principles. "
511,Different user can access different feature,"I have already developed website in nodejs and MySQL   Now my client wants to add payment functionality. We have lots of features in the website like:-   1) Copy   2) Save   3) Delete   4) Groups   5) Read,  and many more.   We have a different package for each feature. I am not sure how to manage this? Can anyone tell me what will be the best approach to do this? "
512,"What Kind of Options Do I Have in MS Project For Storing Detailed, Formatted Notes and Comments?","I am new to MS project and afik, for each task we can add detailed notes to it. But is there a way I can capture more information.   For example, I need to store the details of the task in one note and further need to capture the progress. I don't need just the completion progress, but email exchanges and comments, etc. How do you do this? Is a custom field the answer? Is it possible to have rich text attached to a custom field? "
513,How you answer for such question on job interview: Why would you like to be a Project Manager?,"I would like to ask you Directors, PMs, and HRs for something. Lately I have been on several job interviews. The question what very often I have heard was: ""Why would you like to be a Project Manager?"". What would be your answer? Why you are a Project Manager? What answer you give? What answer would you like to hear? "
514,Would you hire a project manager with no programmer background in an IT environment?,"As a team member, or as a programmer, would you accept a boss like that? If he wants to learn and he is interested by programming and what a programmer does? Can somebody with not programming background understands quickly how an IT environment works? "
515,Rapid and efficient product development processes,"I work for an agency that has a number of customers that fall into the same trap. They have a concept for a piece of software, we do some analysis, sign-off on initial scope/backlog and a reasonable budget and start agile development. However once the client starts to see the product they cant help but tweak endlessly despite our protests and go massively over budget.  What is the state of the art in building new software products efficiently as possible? Should we be prototyping the interface (smoke and mirrors, no backend functionality) until it looks and behaves exactly the way users want it, then build out the functionality? When does a prototype stop and the real product start? Who are the most progressuve thinkers on this front and what are the leading concepts in delivering new software products to market quickly and with minimal waste? Is lean startup (Ries) the most forward movement to adopt? "
516,Introducing fun at work for Software Engineering team,"As a manager of a 20 member software engineering team, I would like to introduce some fun element at work. This is mostly to bring in a good team synergy, fun, motivation and cross communication in a team that is lacking all of these.   I myself was looking through Gamification videos like Speed Camera Lottery and was inspired to try something like this in my team. ie., rewarding positive behavior than constraining people with a lot of parameters to evaluate them.   What I would like to introduce is a system where I can kick-start this kind of awarding positive behavior by fun ways. For instance, I would initially start by awarding all engineers a seed fund of points, say 100 each and they have to spend and also earn points from others by helping, communicating, or motivating others.  For instance, as a simple case, a developer can send an email with a question to help him or her re-frame the question he is going to ask to customer, and is going set a value, ie., award 10 points to anyone who helps.     Help review this email that I am sending to customer about Dashboard   feature. 10 points will be rewarded to the one who helps me with this.   With regards, -O   I would like all of this to be exchanged within an email system but don't mind if its can be accomplished by an existing web solution. The important part is the fun element of exchanging the points and cashing it end of the month back to me to get some sort of gift or lunch coupon. I know the idea becomes a project in itself as all other cases need to be handled.   Has anyone introduced such a system in their workplace? What systems are used or anything close to what I would like to accomplish?  I might not be clear from a reader's point, so please feel free to ask me more information. Thanks in advance. "
517,How handle small refactorings and minor code base improvements in Scrum?,"How should be handle small improvements, should we include story for them in each sprint? Or should it be done outside of the sprint scope? I am talking here about things like Uncle Bob's boy scout rule.   Other option could be to accommodate time in each ticket?  "
518,"As a project manager, how do you manage interpersonal conflicts between your team members?","I am talking about a personality conflict, between two people or more, that builts up tension in the team, ruins the team spirit and worsen the quality of life at work. Most of the time, those are not open conflicts, but unspoken; but you can sometime feel the heat. How to deal with those kinds of situations before they get worse. Do you apply a process or do you have a personal way to solve interpersonal conflicts? What works the best? I am talking about a situation where everybody suffer about it in the team. "
519,Keeping track of time per developer per task using TFS,"I am a 2 month old PM came out as a developer. One thing that I am facing issues here in my company is how to keep track of time per task per developer. Like we are using TFS and we are creating BLI (Back Log Items/Tasks) etc. Plus we are using ClickTime (Online software for billing and tracking time in projects).   Now when I see this as a developer stand of point, I am like this is PIA. 2 time tracking systems...DARN !!!  I am trying to push my team into TFS and updating it to sharepoint. Which is working great so far. How should I link it to my MS Project? Or will MS Project really be helping me in this?  Any suggestions? "
520,Growth of Project Manager in Software Development,I am a newbie in PM role right now and would like to know that what are the various levels of growth?   I am 25 in age and 2 months veteran in PM role. What would be my goal in next 2 years? When should I make a switch (after how many years of experience in PM role)?   Thanks! 
521,What should be the methodology followed by a research and development project?,"I am an Engineering undergrad and I am working towards establishing a 8-10 person team for a 6-8 month long academic research project.   Timeline  We will be starting the groundwork for the project in September and initially, due to time constraints, we will be working slowly. From January to April, will be when we will be able to do most of the work related to the project as the time constraint will get removed.  Uptil December, we will only be doing on-paper R&amp;D. All practical work will start from January.  The project deadline is April end.  Project Description  The project is a cross-department engineering project. The project has a very steep learning curve for all of us involved and there will be lots and lots of mistakes and time overruns on our part.    Team Description  The team members are from four different engineering departments, only 4 of whom have previously participated in cross-department projects (but on a much smaller scale). None of us have any experience working on this scale or budget, or of the necessary project management required.  Also, we do not have a faculty adviser till January.   My Role  I will be working on the project in multiple roles. One, working in my domain area, and two, as the unofficial* project manager.  *At the moment.  So, my questions :   What project management methodology would be effective and have low overheads as well as be easy to understand by everybody involved? What application or tool would be recommended for managing the project, keeping in mind that the team will be meeting infrequently till December, and hence the medium must allow for remote collaboration? How important is it to have a person acting as a project manager on the team? Is there a need to make this role explicit? Briefly, what will be the responsibilities of the project manager for a project of this scale and size?      Update  Based on certain discussions, we have decided to use either Spiral model or Agile. Spiral model is something that most members of the team are (conceptually) familiar with. Agile will be new for all of us, both conceptually and practically.  Out of these two, which one would be preferable? "
522,Scrum compatibility with PMBOK® Guide,My question is quite simple : Is Scrum methodology compatible with PMBOK® Guide ? In other words How can we manage a project using the Scrum methodology in the PMI Framework? 
523,Am I eligible to get PMP Certification?,"I have done my Masters in Business Administration with HR and Marketing as my Specialization. It's been four years. I am currently working as Lead Recruiter with  a Reputed Organization. So, I just want to know whether or not I am eligible to get the PMP Certification. If so, what would be the channel to get it done?  Please help me; what would be the best way to get the certification done and what are the pros and cons I will be facing?  This would really be a great help to change my domain. "
524,Is Scrum or Kanban only applicable to projects of larger size or projects with greater magnitude?,Can we use Scrum or Kanban for smaller tasks or projects? Let's say that I have a small software project comprising of the following:   Registration Form Contact Form Admin Section   And then in the end my client said these details are partial. More details will be sent after 5 or 10 days.   My core question is: can we use Scrum and Kanban for this project or not? If not then why not? Please explain. 
525,Does the act of measuring progress also slow progress?,"I recently read an article on Heisenberg developers.  In a nutshell, the author is arguing that the act of measuring progress has the effect of slowing progress.  Does this principle have an official name (or even a buzzword) in project management circles?  Is this an area of project management research?  Is there any evidence that it is true, and in what circumstances? "
526,Difference between maintenance and development,"I currently work in an agile environment that works primarily in web development for a university. My boss always talks about the differences between maintenance and development while also considering the possibility of enhancements.  My question is... Is there a specific definition that can define the differences between maintenance/development/enhancement? And, does that definition also depend on the type of process your team is using (i.e. we are currently using SVN and making a transition to git)? "
527,Is it accepted practice to group user stories by epics in the sprint backlog?,"I have a sprint backlog with about 50 user stories that can be broken down into 7 epics. However, each epic is only partially represented in the current sprint.   For example, one of the epics is migrating content. For sprint 1, we will do 3/10 user stories. 4/10 in sprint 2 and the remaing 3/10 in sprint 3.  Questions:   Is this the proper use of an Epic? Is it acceptable to organize user stories by epics in a sprint backlog when the epic is not fully represented in any one sprint?  "
528,Development manager in the morning scrum,"In a company, the development manager comes from a technical and PM background. He also acts as a tech lead, without doing any development work though. He focuses on the management side of the role.   In the morning scrum meeting, the developers start talking about yesterday, today and if there any impediments. The development manager starts asking questions to the team members such as ""where are we on this?"", ""why did this occur?"" etc. The team members reply, therefore many times starting going into details. The Scrum Master has tried mentioning that this is not a technical meeting, but the manager replies that he wants to know what's going on ""with this specific thing"" or ""we need to understand this better"". Sometimes he replies to the SM ""hold on, we need to discuss this"", therefore the SM has given up trying to refocus the discussion. Other times, the SM will try to coordinate the discussion on a topic, and the manager will say ""let's move on, this can wait"". Sometimes he will even get annoyed if the SM says ""let's take this offline"".  The SM had separate discussions with the manager on this, and the manager replies with arguments such as ""the morning scrum is a great place to catch up on what is going on, without distracting people throughout the day"", and ""some people need coordination, therefore we need to hold their hands for a bit"".  In this company the manager is responsible for the delivery of the product and has been working very closely to the team since day one. He has contributed a lot and still does, but it seems that he wants to control every aspect of the meeting, and the development (this propagates down to planning, where the manager will ask things to be done and therefore prioritising the backlog along with the PO).   In this company, there is a fixed project deadline, and it sounds far more important to meet the deadline ""no matter what"", rather than cultivate a scrum environment. The SM and PO feel hopeless, and they don't feel things can change. What would be your suggestions to SM and development manager, in order to facilitate scrum better? "
529,What is the effective procedure or process to get the esimate of the Project Managers time on the projects ?,"When you estimate for project management i.e PM's role time, do you take a certain % of the total estimate? Can  you provide me the process or procedure used in general and how accurate it is? "
530,How do I incorporate product managers with Backlog control into JIRA?,"My company has several product offerings, each with a dedicated development team, plus a number of people on the business side that control the product's direction.  We currently use a homegrown ticketing solution that allows business to create tickets, work with project managers to gather requirements, and eventually drop the tickets on a product's development queue. The business owner of that product controls the order of the backlog.  In JIRA, what is the optimal way to get this functionality across?  I understand JIRA Software now has the concept of ""business projects"" and ""software projects"". Should I move tickets from one to the other? Business doesn't need to see all of the development fluff we need for day-to-day operations, and we do not need to see what they are currently planning on their side. "
531,How can Joint Application Development improve a workshop?,"I go to workshop after workshop with the same one dimensional approach - too many people, everyone looking at the screen while someone is capturing requirements/assumptions etc, dry, boring, not engaging, requirements are missed because people want to be somewhere else, mobile phones and laptops litter the tables etc for capturing stakeholder requirements and providing an excellent solution to a stakeholders problems.   Yesterday I stumbled across Joint Application Development (JAD). It appears to promise the complete opposite to what I have been experiencing above. How can I implement this approach? Are there alternatives with the same end result of engagement and collaboration? "
532,Calculating project forecasts in Jira,"As a Scrum Master, I want to help my Product Owner to make an educated guess of when features in a project will be implemented, in order to communicate with stakeholders so that they can manage Scope. Leading to priorities and a release plan forecast.  One way to forecast is to create a backlog of Epics and User Stories and ask the team to give a high-level guesstimates in story points. For example with a Swimlane sizing technique. Then populate the Jira estimation field with these values. After some sprints you could use the Release burndown or Version report to forecast dates when certain features might be completed.  But as Jira only has single Estimation field I am afraid when this fields is already populated this will influence the developer estimations during the Sprint planning meetings, certainly because the initial project estimates might not really size relatively to what we using during our Sprints.  Rather I would like to do:   Create a high-level guesstimate in T-Shirt sizes (not Story Points) Create around two Sprints worth of detailed Story Points estimated Backlog Use the velocity of the previous Sprints to calculate how much high-level estimates we can process to give a forecast Update guesstimates during Backlog Refinement sessions. Preferable automate this with the Jira Version Report   Now my question:   Do you have a setup like this working in Jira and how did you implement this? Do you have a better alternative plan for giving project forecasts in Jira? Could we use something else instead of Jira to give these forecasts?  "
533,PMI-PMP relation,"I started a research about what is PMP.  For doing that I think a good idea is to become a member of a PMI Chapter.   I am mexican and there is a chapter here.    Question  Can I enroll in other chapters as well?  I am interested in visiting Los Angeles, it is a good idea to pay L.A. Chapter fee now? Do I have better opportunities?  Can I expect to make some volunteering there if I am a PMI member? "
534,Earned value analysis by client and vendor,"We all know that some project managers (those that follow PMBOK/PMP) do earned value analysis to know SPI and CPI.  Schedule Performance Index (SPI) = Earned Value ÷ Planned Value -- How are we doing against the schedule?     And   Cost Performance Index (CPI) = Earned Value ÷ Actual Cost -- How are we doing against the budget?     I have two questions :   Suppose we have client X and contractor Y.  X wants to build a website and selected Y as its vendor. The contract signed was of type T&amp;M (time &amp; material).  How does the vendor (Y) do Earned value analysis, and how is it different from that of client (X)?  In short, what parameters does a vendor consider while calculating earned value, planned value and actual cost? "
535,How can I stop my remaining estimate to be adjusted?,"In JIRA, we have a task for standups and meetings, obviously this task does not need an estimate, but it is useful to have time tracking on it.  However, when I log time on this issue, the remaining estimate either becomes N/A (first time I log time; cannot submit the time log) or it becomes minus however long I logged (also cannot submit the time log).  Is there a way I can create tasks that have no time estimate? Or do I need to adjust the remaining to 0 each time I log time on a meeting or standup? "
536,Where should I keep track of open items from previous sprints?,"I have been throwing ""things that team will do later"" (TTWDL) into the product backlog along with product functionality to be implemented. Needless to say it is now long and full of bugs/ tasks from previous sprints. I can't figure a different place to keep track of open items from previous sprints.  I read the following two posts and am in no better spot:   Is backlog refinement (grooming) waste? Sprint Backlog vs Product Backlog   How can I keep track of open bugs/tasks from previous sprints separate from product backlog items related to new functionality? "
537,How is XP/ Continuous Integration different from DevOps?,"Is DevOps just the new ""cool"" term for Extreme Programming?   Recently speaking with a company about doing some coaching work for them. They have decided that to be successful they need to do ""DevOps"" and want to know what my DevOps experience is. One of the people was even pretty insistent it wasn't ""agile"".   If you look at the Venn diagram of DevOps, on Wikipedia it's the center of Dev, QA and IT.

I'm just seeing a new term on concepts that are foundations of XP.  "
538,"How to use Kanban for consulting work, take 2","My question is kind of a follow-up on this one. I've started using the Personal Kanban method at work:   I'm using Trello, with 2 boards (Options and Tasks). I chose to keep the Options (Backlog) board separate since I have a lot going on and it would be overwhelming to have everything in one place, especially since Trello doesn't allow users to collapse boards. The ""Tasks"" board has the following columns: Short term, Priorities (limit of 5), WIP (limit of 3), Pen (Blocked), and Done. I'm using color-less labels for projects, and colour labels for types of work (admin, urgent, unplanned, quick), etc.   At the moment I am using this system for myself only, but people are starting to notice what I'm doing, and some of them are interested in trying it out.   I work in public engagement and communication consulting, and we typically work in small project-based teams that can stay active for a few weeks or a few months, depending on the project. Most of us work on several projects at a time - for instance, I'm working on 10 active projects right now, each with different teams.  My understanding is that ideally, anything anyone from our 12-people team is working on should be on the same board since otherwise it would make it hard to limit WIP, and in order for it to not become overwhelming, the task size should be kept at high level and we should use subtasks to account for individual work. My concern with this is that it would make it hard to track WIP at the individual level. Would you recommend using a personal kanban board (separate from the team board) to track individual work? If so, how do you make sure people keep updating both (personal and team) boards as they go along? And what do you do with small tasks that don't fit under a higher-level task?  Thanks in advance! "
539,How to manage spec / user stories in Agile/Scrum,"One of the common problems with traditional spec is that it's usually out of date. However, if we use a list of user stories as the spec, the thing is that the requirement may be scattered and cannot follow once it becomes complex.  For example, we delivered a user story and some time later, we decide to change some behaviors which make some acceptance criteria of that user story obsolete.    If we don't update that user story and just create new one, long time later the new member cannot follow the changes. While doing regression test, our QC may miss those old changes. How can we prevent this? If we update the user story, then how to version those changes throughout the time?   "
540,How to manage remote developers?,"I have a small company that produce commercial WordPress themes. Things are working well and I want to hire a freelance Front End Developer to help me. I never managed a remote person(the city I live in is too small, and I don't find local people).

541,"How to encourage team members to contribute to an open, yet respectful, team environment?","recently, I asked how to deal with PMs weaknesses from a team members point of view:  Is it the team members responsibility to correct PMs weaknesses? (or at least in his own interest)  I sense a wide agreement that team members should raise according questions to PM, but they might not always do so. This contradiction makes me wonder how a PM can encourage team members to behave as you consider it most helpful? To give you honest, yet respectful, feedback on your weaknesses? Probably not only you, but also within the team?  From my point of view, the ultimate minimum should be:   Behave yourself as you want them to behave. Give honest feedback, mention what is to be mentioned, but on a objective, non-personal level. Repeat whenever possible that you are interested in their opinion and invite them to give feedback also un-asked, and mean it.   I think some of the principles discussed here How to improve the team-work? might apply for my question as well, but I think there might be more to say on that particular topic.  Thanks for your thoughts. "
542,How should team member act when they learn there was bribery in the project?,"It is a question inspired by the one about handing the bribe: What should a project manager do if he/she is asked to pay a bribe?  Mine is a bit different. You're a project team member in the middle of a project and you accidentally overhear salesperson talking with the client in the way which clearly indicates there was bribery involved to get the project. You personally wouldn't hand the bribe out even if directly asked by your superior. Anyway, no one asked you about that and no one got you involved in that. You didn't get your hands dirty - you only learned about the situation. What should you do? "
543,Assign work to QA team using Scrum template in TFS,"I am learning about using Scrum with Team Foundation Server (TFS). The project template is Scrum and we have the three columns Todo,  In Progress and Done.   Once the developers have completed their work and moved their tasks to Done what is the best practice to let the QA team know the work is done and they need to test it?  I watched the TFS Scrum training on PluralSight and this was brought up in the video and the facilitator said the answer was to just ""tell the QA team its done and they would start their test plans"".  Is this really the way its done in Scrum? You just tell them QA person, either verbally or in email, ""Hey, I am done with Task 34, start testing?""  I would be curious to know how others are doing this.  This is our first time trying to full utilize Scrum on my team and I know this is going to come up especially with my QA team whom is used to Waterfall and being assigned tasks.  Thanks! "
544,Agile in enterprise: How to represent the requirements of non-business stakeholders?,"I currently work on a large scale software project in a large company.  We follow an agile approach for development; however, due to the size of the the company there are several stakeholders that normally are not spoken about or simply assumed to be the developers in the Agile process.  Stakeholders example:   Architecture: Defines enterprise architecture guidelines Development: Defines enterprise development guidelines Product Design: Defines enterprise branding and design guidelines  IT Security: defines enterprise IT security guidelines Operations: 24/7h operations support Customer Support: 24/7h client support  Rollout: Rollout of the application per client ( client specific configurations )   Should I use User stories?   As IT security, I want to ...  or Debt tasks? Tech debt - Code needs to be refractored ISO debt - Application must follow ISO1234 Rollout debt - Configuration automation Operations debt - Special tool to manage data cache   Pratical example:   As application management, I want to be able to invalidate the cache, so the application is cleared of corrupt data.   The above doesn't really make sense to me as a business value user story. It represents more a maintenance required feature.   Is there any common practice on how to integrate the requirements of these stakeholders in user stories? What is the best way to express the requirements from these stakeholders? They are functional yet not business value adding requirements.  "
545,Functional Decomposition Diagrams help,I have to do some planning for an hypothetical DropBox-like project.

Is there a newbie-friendly help site? 
546,Benefits of getting CAPM before PMP,"I'm a software developer. I'm looking to expand my skillset and pick up some management knowledge and experience; I'd like to try being a dev lead for a few projects, but I also want to have the option of moving into the project management career path if I so choose.  I'd planned on taking the CAPM, as it's a subset of the PMP test. I figured that this would further my goal. However, the market I'm in (the profession, as well as my local job market) seems to value SCRUM certification over PMI, as many software firms use agile methodologies these days.  I'm thinking about updating my plan. My question is this: does the CAPM contribute to the PMP certification in any way?  I understand that the CAPM and the PMP both pull from the PMBOK. I understand that the CAPM is a subset of the PMP. My plan was to get the CAPM and attempt to use it to break into a role where I could gain experience to get the CAPM. However, since all I need is three years of management experience....can't I just read the PMBOK, get the requisite experience with a SCRUM certification, and then take the PMP?  Are there any benefits of taking the CAPM before the PMP instead of pursuing another certification path besides knowledge found in the PMBOK? "
547,Are GTD techniques applicable to PM?,"Is Getting Things Done helpful in terms of understanding PM, and does it make any direct contributions?  I'm not asking whether GTD will make you better organized, or more effective generally.  I mean, has it led to practical tools for PM? "
548,What are the first steps (if any) to implement an effective kata for project management?,"In software development, the concept of a programming kata is being practiced by many developers (e.g. examples of programming kata, book on katas) to be exposed to new good practices and get used to them.  I was about to ask if you could develop a similar routine for improving your project management skills, but it seems you can (e.g article on katas for management and coaching skills).  So my question is, if they can be an effective way to gain and share good practices, what are the first steps you should do to organize/take part to such effective PM katas? "
549,Should we limit who can submit stories in Scrum?,"A few of the managers at my company have decided that the stack of stories is too high, so they're going to truncate the backlog and the number of people who can write stories.     The goal being, only approved story submitters can create feature requests.  Is this antithetical to Scrum?  Doesn't it just mean the Product Owners are being too lazy to vet cruddy stories?  Our backlog is at about 1400, I recently went through the backlog and figured, on my own as a scrummaster/developer that I could shrink it to about 600.    What advice should I give the Product Owners around this idea?  Should I vehemently oppose this idea as a Scrum Master?       What is the long term plan for this project?     these are multiple projects that usually have a 6-12 month of development work until they're done and then continuously improved until they're retired.      Will there be some release point after which development will pretty much stop, or will it have continuous development for an indeterminate time with many releases?     Development probably will only stop when feature requests stop being submitted by customers and other stakeholders      You said you found a large number of stories that you could remove--are these duplicate stories, useful but poorly written stories, or stories that could be useful but you don't see the development team ever getting around to them?     a few duplicates, many potentially contradictory stories.  Lots are ones that none of us see the dev team getting to as written, but they may be the seeds for things that need to be done.        And who exactly has been entering the stories you think could be chopped (developers, product owner, other customers)?      Developers and users of the platform (our guys, not paying customers) maybe 3% are customer requests.  Most come from end users,  we mainly develop in-house utilities that are used to support many customers - some of the tools produce reports and things that customers see, but those customers don't enter stories. Product Owners, for the most part, don't write the stories, although they may rewrite 'em.   "
550,How can you increase the chances of having good PM candidates from within the technical areas of the company?,"It's not unusual that one of the career paths available to an experienced technician is going into project management. But Peter's Principle warns us about the risks of doing it without proper preparation, since  succeeding in one position doesn't guarantee further success in the other.  I've found some Q&amp;A about applying for a PM position (e.g. How to handle selection process for new project manager position I'm interested in?, how do I prove my project coordinator skills in the hiring process?) and a very specific question about the transition from programmer to PM, but they deal with the matter from the point of view of the employee, not of the company (or the person leading the hiring process).  If the company prefers promoting Project Managers from the inside, instead of hiring them from the outside (for example because of a steep learning curve), the company has to, somehow, widen the path from technical to managerial tasks, in order to facilitate that some of the technicians could go this way, instead of walking further into their own technical career path.  What are the keys the company needs to search for when hiring new (and good) technicians, so it can increase the chances of some of them becoming good PMs in the future? "
551,How to structure a project plan,"I had an initial meeting with my project stakeholders and was able to define a strategy based on goals that everyone agrees with.

I am thinking on using the five goals above as phases of my project plan.   Do you agree? How would you structure this project plan?  "
552,Should all backlog items exist inside a feature?,"I work in a small development team, and we have recently started using TFS and visual studio online.  Up until now, we have only been using Product Backlog Items, Bugs and Tasks. We would like to start making proper use of Features.  Should all PBIs exist inside a feature, or is it okay to keep some of them ""stand alone""?  I know that a lot of it is down to what works best for the individual team, but are there any guidelines or official suggestions on the topic?  Edit to clarify how we use VSO currently  We currently use visual studio online in a simple manner, up until now we have only used PBI, bugs and tasks. The primary purpose right now for us is a work log for the developers so we know what we have to do and can track our progress. We do not use it for reporting to higher management.  For example, ""create a new widget"" would go in as a PBI, and would have some tasks under it such as ""create DB tables"", ""create HTML form"" etc.  Similarly with bugs, ""pressing this button raises an error"" would go in as a bug with tasks underneath it.  This effectively gives us a pretty long list of PBIs and Bugs each sprint, and we would like to start grouping the PBIs by features. For example, we would create a feature called ""Create a user account area"" and put PBIs underneath it such as ""Create reset password function"", ""Create notification settings page"" etc.  The question then boils down to, is the ""proper"" way of using VSO to have all PBIs under such a feature, or whether its okay to keep some unparented. For example, if we had a PBI called ""Log users out after 1 hour of inactivity"" and we have no logical feature to put this under, should we create a new feature specifically for this (such as ""Session Functionality""), create a generic feature (such as ""Miscellaneous Changes"") or just leave the PBI unparented.  Note these are all just examples "

554,Project Estimation is off by 50% or More! Who is Responsible for Vague Requirements?,"I've just started doing some small contracts for the first time, and I'm working on a project with a person responsible for dealing with the client and analyzing requirements.  In this case, there was a slight incompleteness in one of the project requirements, and this small change makes a huge change in the time that will be needed to implement the requirements (perhaps doubling or tripling the workload).  Who is at fault? Is it the customer for not specifying the requirement, the requirements analyst for not being explicit, or the programmer for not poking holes in it?  More importantly, who is responsible here? Will we have to implement the new requirement without asking for extra compensation?  (If it changes anything, nothing has been signed, there is only a verbal agreement). "

557,"How to use Story Points, if User Stories are completely different?","Story Points (SP) is a good measurement, that allows estimating User Stories.  SP (in my understanding, it's an important note) is convenient because it is relative and not related with time. All estimates are based on comparison with a common basis. But what if two stories have completely different bases?  For simplicity, let's look for an example that is not related to any specific area. Like digging a pit.  Let's assume, that it will take 1 SP for digging a pit one-meter depth. Accordingly, we need 2 SP for making a pit two meters in depth. Very convenient. We don't care about our equipment. If we have a shovel then 1 SP will map to 1 man-day. If we have an excavator then 1 SP will map to 1 man-hour. But two meters pit anyway will take to us twice more time then one-meter pit.  All is good with pit digging. But what if the next story is ""catching of an elephant""?   Should we make estimation with another (elephant related) basis? In that case, we will have two kinds of Story Points, which will be absolutely different. Or, if we know, that 1) catching of one elephant will take for us 1 man-day 2) we still use a shovel for digging, then we should estimate this ""elephant"" story to 1 SP? This suggestion sounds absolutely wrong to me. But I wrote it because in my practice people use this option in most cases. Or, maybe, I just misunderstand the concept of Story Points?  "

559,Most suitable project management tool for a freelancer,"I've been using JIRA for my project management since about a year. Before, I used Basecamp which was pretty useful, but someday I found out I needed time management and other more complex features.  Let's take the fact that I'm the ONLY user on my JIRA instance into account.  I've been trying Nirvana2 today, and it reminded me that all JIRA's complexity has became more of a ""time hog"" than a quick and efficient GTD utility.  I'd just need simple stuff like, project management, task management (maybe with tags or something that makes the sorting easier). Attached file management, time management and reporting capabilities would be a good plus.  The question I'm asking myself today is:  For a freelance software and web developer, what would be better to use? A complete Agile solution such as JIRA and Redmine, or a simple tool like Basecamp, Nirvana2, etc?  Thanks for shedding me some light of yours.  edit: I discovered Nirvana2 and Teambox which seems to be awesome... "
560,How can ITIL Change Management adapt to work with iterative frameworks and the Agile values?,"A Change Management representative recently attended a Scrum workshop for a separate business area not under traditional ITIL Change Management.  He asked for a some guidance and resources on how his department could better integrate with teams working towards the Agile values particularly Scrum.   How does the idea of a Standard, Emergency and Normal change work with the Scrum cadence which seeks working products every timebox?   I know that Scrum is a framework to which we can add patterns and techniques as required but ITIL processes like the CAB are relatively fixed and Change Management can be laborious for Agile teams.  Is there some detailed white papers or guidance or case studies about companies making this transition?    I have found dozens of blog posts but they are piecemeal and very aspirational.   "
561,GitHub Hacked? What to do When the Ignored Developer Strikes Back?,"Today's news is that a developer hacked github. He found a vulnerability in Ruby on Rails, reported it and since nothing had happened - he was ignored and considered as a troll -, he used the vulnerability and hacked the second most famous service which uses Ruby on Rails (github).  Although, this incident has nothing to do with project management, it got me thinking; there are lot of developers who lack the necessary communication skills and they act instead of talk. I know a handful of developers who would act the same way as the guy who hacked github: they would cause harm, just to prove that they are right. Their intention is questionable for sure, but they are good at what they are doing, but they lack some useful soft skills.  So my questions:   How would you help (coach) such a developer so that he won't act and will do the right thing? I used help on purpose, because firing someone is an easy answer. Let's say that you find a critical error in your customer's application, but she doesn't listen. What is your best practice to persuade her so that she'll take the problem seriously?  "
562,How can we manage schedule risks brought into a project by 3rd party software?,"Working in web-development, I face a common situation when clients want to use 3rd party software as a starting point of the project. That could be a CMS, an e-commerce site, or something else. Motivation is usually budget-driven; it seems to the client that having a web site built atop of some off-the-shelf product will cut costs. It is not always true. For example:   The client (often a non-technical person) was told that it's super-easy to build a 3-page website using a famous CMS. However, nobody knows what it takes to build a 100-page website, with a blog feature and 3 levels of paid membership. The team doesn't know the CMS before the project starts, so adding requested features become a hard task, and the existing CMS code often stands in the way of effective development. It also may turn out that there's no decent documentation. The team would create similar features faster without that CMS, but the client still insists on using it. Adding custom design to the CMS-based site may cause trouble for HTML developers, requiring development of non-trivial code (for example, an obscure menu system). It may turn out that the CMS is not compatible with the hosting that was usually used for deployment, the CMS has internal flaws preventing scalability in production, or that the solution requires enormous hardware setup to operate properly under load.   That leads to questions I'd like to ask:   How can we convince a client that his solution should not require a custom CMS, or that it may take longer to develop a custom solution using pre-existing code? Clients usually has arguments like 'the biggest sites on the Internet are using this CMS,' but we don't really know how much effort was put but those biggest sites to run the CMS properly. How to include 3rd party (or pre-existing) code into our initial estimation and risk-management calculations?  Any numbers and techniques are welcome.  "
563,Example epics for an mobile game,"I want to define epics for the following project: ""a mobile application which makes you discover a city through a detective game"".  The game basically needs to display your position on a map to get you from one key point to another; when you arrive at a key point, you have to solve some kind of riddle to unlock the next key point. The fact that the game can be played offline is required.  I am new to Agile and project management (as it is a university project) and I tried to gather some epics. I found plenty of example of epics for Web projects, but nothing for mobile game development.  So far, I have the following epics:   As a user, I want to be able to know where to go next As a user, I want to be able to store my progression in the game As a user, I want to be able to share my progression in the game As a user, I want to use the application offline   My questions are:   Which ""who"" should I put: only ""user"", or should ""developer"", ""tester"", ""admin"", etc. be included? From which point of view should we see things? For instance, should it be ""As a user, I want to use the application offline"" or ""As a developer, I want the application to work offline""? Are epics 2 and 3 not user stories instead? Should they not be part of a same epic ""As a user, I want to store and share my progression""? Do you have any examples from your experience or ideas of epics which could fit this project?  "

565,how to cover details (side effect not desired workflow) with scrum user stories,"As a scrum/agile system student, I find the situation where you have to write up a user story in the classical form and at the same time, describe the behaviour of parallel workflow, very hard. As a very simple and general example that can describe the situation, we can write this user story:     As a user that wants to purchase an article, I want to be able to pay with MasterCard, so that the purchased order can be set to status 'to deliver'.   On this user story, there are tons of different ""user task alternate workflow"" or situations that can define different processes (not necessary errors), like:   While a customer places an order, their credit card failed While a customer places an order, their user session times out While a customer uses an ATM machine, the machine runs out of receipts and needs to warn the customer While a customer places an order, their credit card number doesn't exist While a customer places an order, the PIN failed   (maybe are not the best examples, but just for describing side effects).  In Agile/Scrum system, you can only describe the desired behaviour, but not the side effects/parallel workflows.  My questions:   How do you advice me to put in the backlog stories that covers these situations? How do you advice me to create stories that follow a ""Task Process Workflow Diagram""? (this second question is different but related)  "
566,At what Work Item level does the Product Owner prioritize in TFS?,"This question could be similar to At what level should the Product Owner prioritize work?. However, I ask questions based on specific use cases that is not addressed there.  Our team is reviewing our Agile process while we look at moving to Kanban style flow instead of Sprints. One question we are having a hard time answering is     At what level (what type of Work Item) should the Product Owner   be prioritizing at?   In our mind, it comes down to either Feature or User Story (Bug). However, no matter which one we choose, we are seeing scenarios where it would cause problems.  User Story  Our understanding is that the developers always work at the User Story level. (Yes...they also can work at the Task level but the highest point is Story.)  That implies that the Product Owner is submitting and prioritizing User Stories and Bugs.  However, it is possible that a develop would break up a User Story into multiple stories due to scheduling, division of work with other developers, or some other reason.  In this case, the Product Owner may not care or even become confused with the appearance of these seemingly unrelated Stories on the board.  Feature  Alternatively, we could have the Product Owner work at the Feature level, while letting the developers continue working with User Stories.  This means that the PO is submitting and prioritizing Features. It would also allow the developer to create more than one User Story without the PO potentially getting confused.  The problem with this approach is handling Bugs. Since bugs appear at the User Story level, how would the PO properly prioritize on the two different Boards? I guess the bug could be entered as a Feature (with a child Bug also existing) but that seems wrong.  Functionality Group  This section could probably be submitted as a separate question but I have added it because my 2nd approach exposes the problem...  Maybe ""Feature"" is the wrong word used in TFS, but in my mind a Work Item Feature would be ""particular functionality in an application"". For example, a Feature titled ""The ability to sort search results"". Example, User Stories under that could be ""Sort by Id field"" and ""Sort by Last Modified field"".  Assume that this piece of functionality is rolled out and then some time later, an enhancement titled ""Sort by Name"" is submitted. Should that be submitted as a new Feature? If so, how (and should it) be related to the original Feature? Or should it be submitted as a User Story related to the original Feature causing the now closed Feature to be reopened?  How does this affect bugs? Should a Bug be associated with the original Feature?  Would Epics come into play in any of this? "
567,How to get milestone to auto-schedule for next day in MS Project?,"I'm working with MS Project 2013.  I have tasks set to auto-schedule, and to default to fixed work.  I have 2 milestones, one of which depends on the other.  The first one triggers some work which leads to the 2nd one, but I'm not interested in tracking that work, just the two milestones.  So I set milestone 2 to have milestone 1 as a predecessor with a 1 day lag, and set the durations of both to 0 days (in order to get them to turn into milestones).  The problem is that once I've done all that, they show as both completing on the same day.  My intent is that milestone one is by the end of day 1, and milestone 2 is by the end of day 2.  If I leave milestone 2 as a regular task with a duration of ""1 day?"" it schedules as I'd expect, but as soon as I change it to a milestone by setting its duration to 0 days, it jumps back onto the same day as milestone 1.  Here's a pic for clarity:    What I'd want/expect is for milestone 2 to schedule itself for 9/30.  Any way to get them to both be milestones but schedule the way I want with resorting to manual scheduling? "

570,"Is it possible for someone to be a member of two Scrum teams, and how can that be made to work most effectively?","We have an organization where we're moving to two scrum teams working on different parts of our our backlog. I understand the idea that each team should be a complete cross-functional unit, and shouldn't have other distractions. That seems like a perfect ideal.  In our case, we have a team member whose skills could be useful to both teams, but where both teams usually don't have full-time work for her. To make this concrete, she's a web designer (and web is not our main product), but the same thing could apply to anyone with a specialized skillset. And she's very good at what she does, so saying ""well, work on this one team and find other ways to help — write some docs or something"" is both suboptimal and unfulfilling for her.  Is there a good way for her to contribute to both teams without feeling like she has double the meta-work and conflicting priorities?  If so, how best to handle this? What if there's four people who feel this way rather than just one?  If not, what to do instead? The approach I'm leaning towards is making sure all user stories are split such that everything which requires some web design can be handled entirely by her team, but I don't know how well that will scale.

571,Is formal tasking required on a Scrum Team,"I understand formal Agile-Scrum tasking as the practice of documenting tasks and estimating task hours for each story or product backlog item a team commits to in an iteration.  A task defines part of the ""how"" the story will get done.  Usually I see teams task out their stories during or soon after an iteration planning session.  Are you still following Scrum if a team doesn't formally task out and track task progression in an iteration?    I've worked with several, what I consider, mature teams that don't task at all and work solely at the story &amp; story point estimation level in managing their commitments.  What are the benefits of not formally tasking?    What are the risks? "
572,How to calculate moving performance target?,"As you will see, I'm completely new to PM.   I have to write 100,000 words in 6 months. Let's say that is 548 words/day. I would like to know how to calculate a daily target of words needed to complete on time. What method do I use to calculate this moving target based on my performance in each previous week while spreading out/smoothing(?) the required load over the next week in order to avoid difficult peaks in demand and still reach my target?   To add further complexity, how would I control the daily rate/smoothing based on the average velocity achieved in the previous week?  Sorry I cannot describe this in statistical/PM terminology, I simply couldn't find the name of this function/problem/method.  Thanks "
573,Sizing a potential project rapidly without formal estimation,"We have been asked by management to spend a very short period of time to ""size"" a software project - that is, to give them a very loose ballpark of time to implement the entire thing.  There are three major components (backend, ios, android), each to be the responsibility of one developer with domain expertise. Each person has been given thirty minutes to come up with a number.  We have been given a one-page requirements document, have extrapolated some coarse user stories, and a coarse flow doc. We're developers, not project managers, and there is no Project Owner as our company is in pre-sales on this project and wants to give the prospective client a loose number.  As developers we are uncomfortable with giving numbers on such a limited foundation. During development we generally do Scrum (stories, points, sprints, standups, velocity, etc), so once we're working on a project our estimates come easily and have some basis in reality. In this case though, there is no project yet and we're unsure of how best to proceed.  How should we handle this? And in future, how could our company do things better? "
574,Activity report software/web application,"   Possible Duplicate:   What time tracking / time management software do you use?       Do you know/use any 'activity report' software? I mean an application, where employees sign in, and report how many hours they worked every day in a month (possibly also a description of what exactly have they done, or a list of tasks completed)? "
575,Should a PM continue to stay on a project after a legal dispute?,"Situation: The main dev left a project and deadlines have gone up in smoke. The client is upset after 3 weeks of no significant improvement (obviously, new devs have a huge learning curve). The client has now sent in a legal letter stating to have the project done by x date. The current PM knows that this date is impossible to meet.  Question: Should the PM remain on the project? I ask because does this not imply a lack of trust and warrants bringing on a new PM on board for this project? Additionally, now that the project has entered legal waters, every single piece of communications has to go through the Board to ensure nothing is being miscommunicated. This is obviously a very stressful situation for the current PM.  I'm not asking for an opinion, but for a factual answer that addresses this kind of scenario. "
576,How to choose responsible for implementing decision in self-organizing team?,"I'm trying to move closer to self-organization in my team. And we have no problem making decisions on our meetings -- we have good agreement on the decisions. But then we have problem with assigning implementation of the decision to specific members -- who should go and just do it?  So, my question is: how to choose responsible for implementing decision in self-organizing team?  P.S. The question appeared while I've been getting familiar with so-called Teal Organizations and particularly Advice Process. But it doesn't matter very much, because the question relates to any self-organizing team, I think. "
577,Is the PM's required knowledge in agile environment changing nowadays?,"We see software developers these days that do not know what does it mean not to use TDD or other practices of XP, project leaders that never worked in a non-agile environment, etc. These people don't know what is a critical path analysis, they've never did any WBS neither worked with a Gant chart and so on...  So is the knowledge base for a PM changing these days? We focus on skills where it usually falls into interpersonal ones, but what about the knowledge that the today's PM should have?  I assume we're talking about companies that grow from startups (not the ones that are transforming). Do they for example need to know the PMBOK?   I know it's always good to know more than less, but from a pragmatic point of view? Does it mean an agile PMs are becoming more ignorant or do they gain/require a different set of knowledge? If the latter, then what kind of knowlege/areas of interest are they right now? "
578,Can Prince2 include a scrum?,"I am currently managing a work package on a large research grant. I am a qualified Prince2 practitioner (although I did the training some time ago and the system is not widely used in my field, so I may be doing it wrong) and had been following the management-by-exception principle, but a few months ago we had an issue with a partner not mentioning an issue until it was in danger of causing us to miss a milestone. I am a complete newcomer to Agile but I have heard of the daily 'scrum' meeting and it sounds like it would be effective at addressing the problems we are having - and I remember our trainer mentioning dire consequences of failing to follow the management-by-exception principle, but crucially not what they were...  What would be the potential pitfalls of adopting a similar process within a Prince2 PM framework? And if they are serious, what would be an alternative to avoid a repeat of the situation above? "
579,Should a Scrum Master also perform a functional manager role?,"We're trying to plan for agile transformation soon, and one of the main sticking points in this is organizational structure. Management's expectation is to have a Scrum Master perform all normal functions, but tacking on hiring, firing, and performance reviews for people under his management. This would also add additional ""technical ability"" requirements to this position, and then basically have one Scrum Master for the team.  My concern is that it's going to create a situation in which s/he will be tempted to say how exactly something needs to be done, and people will take his/her word for it, as she/he's ultimately doing performance reviews. This undermines some of the basic agile principles.  Does this work long term? And what are the caveats I should watch out for implementing this? "
580,What's the difference between software engineering and software project?,"I find that I'm confused between the terms ""software engineering"" and ""software project"".   What is the difference between these? I suspect that ""software engineering"" may focus on a different aspect, but I'm not 100% sure. Can someone please explain? "
581,No trust between Project Manager and Sponsor,What should a PM do if he has sound reasons not to trust his sponsor? And if the sponsor openly acknowledges that he doesn't trust the PM?  This is a challenge found all too often (and migrated from another site). 
582,How can we register the technical debt in Scrum?,"Scrum emphasizes that all members of the team must know the technical debt of the product. But sometimes, this debt is not tangible as a simple to-do list. Should we register it as another task in the product backlog to review in another sprint? Or should we put it in some document related to this product, so the team can actually know what tasks should be treated later in the development?  I'm not seeing a good way to keep this debt in developers' minds; it can be forgotten later. "
583,What is part of the Customer Relations team in Scrum@Scale,"The Scrum@Scale guide documents a Customer Relations team as a separate entity, but does not specify what it entails.     Customer Relations, Legal / Compliance, and People Operations are   included here since they are necessary parts of organizations and will   exist as independent Scrum teams on their own, which all of the others   may rely upon.      [website]         What are the common roles/responsibilities of a CR team in Scrum@Scale? e.g. would CR also contain a sales like activity? Why is this team not near the pentagon they relate to? As an independent Support/Implementation/Sales/Customer team, with a PO which feeds its local MetaScrum.   I guess my question really is why is it specially named and not part of the normal scaling organisation? It makes me feel you can handle it with a small team 3-9 people and does not need to scale ever. "
584,"Perf.A(task X) >> Perf.B(task X), and Perf.A(task Y) > Perf.B(task Y) - whom do you assign?","Ok, admittedly, that title is quite cryptic, but couldn't imagine any better short explanation.  What I mean is the following: The (expected) performance / qualification of employee A is MUCH higher than that of employee B for a given task X. The (expected) performance / qualification of employee A is also higher than that of employee B for task Y, but the difference is not that big.  In short, the general assumption (at least one that I have - may be discussed in another question), that 'everyone has his strengths and weaknesses' does not apply here, to the extend that A is considered to be more qualified / efficient in task completion than B.  Based on which criteria do you decide whom you assign to task X, and whom to Y? Priority and importance of the according tasks? Even though this may sound a little to rational, do you think the concept of 'comparative advantage' may be applied here (disregarding the fact that true qualification is hard to be quantified)?  Does your decision change if task Y is more important and of higher priority than task X? "
585,In SCRUM is it okay to have a separate 'product owner' per story?,"We have stories coming into the backlog from various business area owners, like product support, marketing, partner integration, etc.  We have one Product Owner that manages overall backlog priority stack ranking.  But we want our devs to be able to work directly with the person that is requesting the story for optimal collaboration.  We're calling that the 'Biz Contact' right now, but is there a more common use or term in SCRUM?  Would they be considered the 'Product Owner' for that story?  Or the 'stakeholder' of that story?  Or is it expected in SCRUM that there is only ever one person, the single Product Owner, that the dev team works with for clarity and review of stories? "
586,"MS Project 2013: Overall duration, taking account of non-business days","In Microsoft Project 2013, is there a way of showing ""total duration taking account of non-business days"", rather than simply ""total number of business days""?  For example (using a standard calendar): If I were to enter a sequence of 260 tasks, each of which takes 1 day, and each of which follows on consecutively from the previous (Task A then Task B then Task C etc), then the total duration calculated by MS Project is 260 days.    At first glance this calculated duration appears to imply an overall duration of about 0.7 years (i.e. 260/365) because it only takes account of business days.    If resources will only be working during business hours, I would like to show that the duration is approximately 1 year.  Is this possible? "
587,How can the role of QA maintain the alignment between the Business and IT?,"In my previous organization there was a disconnection between the Business Operations and IT that always impacted the final derivable.  For some reason, the Business intent was not accurately represented on the final product. Even though we reviewed the Business Case over and over there was always a piece of functionality missing or not performing as expected. We did have QA testers in the Development team but no UAT was carried out on the Operational end. So I have few questions of which I would like your support to prevent this issue in my the future,   Should we need QAs at both ends?  Who should be really carrying out the UAT?  Who should write the Test Cases?   "
588,"In scrum, does it ever make sense to hire a product owner?","I have seen a scrum team trying to hire a product owner. They advertise for scrum skills, and experience.  Does it make sense to hire a product owner from outside the company?  If I do what skills should they have? "
589,Is it the team members responsibility to correct PMs weaknesses? (or at least in his own interest),"(I understand that this question may be discussed in a pretty wide sense. However I want to focus on its relevance to PM / PM teams).  Imagine a PM who does not seem to be qualified in several regards, fails to be exact on meetings and dates, provides poor communication, but nevertheless for some reason was raised to that position. Even worse, the PM himself seems to be very convinced of his work and self-confident.  The consequences are not to severe, but nevertheless the project team suffers under those weaknesses.  Do you think it is the team members responsibility to continuously silently correct PMs weaknesses? Bring it to his attention (risking that he may be either insulted or just give it a shrug)? Or just give it a shrug as well, similar to what the PM himself is doing? "
590,Deliver results when finished significantly prior to the agreed deadline?,"In the seldom cases where your project (or milestone) completion estimation was too pessimistic, do you deliver results right away? If not, which tasks do you assign your team members in the meantime?  From my point of view, there are two contradictory thoughts involved:  +Delivering earlier most likely increases costumer satisfaction. +Depending on the contract, it may even decrease costumer costs, which even more contributes to costumer satisfaction  -On the other hand, delivering earlier may significantly weaken your position when working with that costumer again ('10 Months? Last time it was a third less anyways, so nevermind'). -It may question your capability to estimate ('This guys estimate was wrong by a third last time either, maybe better find somebody more suitable...'). - Furthermore, even though if it was a fixed contract, you may be in bad position to justify the price. If not, may be even worse, because company management will be unhappy because of lower project value than expected.  Looking forward to hearing your thoughts on that topic. "
591,"If taking over a project, should the new PM have to stick to the previous PM's estimates?","A new PM taking over a project ""mid stream"" will need to get up to speed with all of the documentation, objectives, etc. If the previous PM had produced estimates that the new PM doesn't agree with, how should the new PM proceed?   Accept the old estimates and try to work within them, or produce new estimates? Produce new estimates?   I see practical difficulties with 1 (especially if the estimates are too tight), and political difficulties with 2, especially if the old PM is still in the organisation. In addition, revising the estimates, especially upwards, will undoubtedly impact on the benefits case. "
592,How do you combine Waterfall with Kanban?,"Our team has a wide variety of work item types.  Some of the work we do is related to projects, some is operational, some we generate internally ourselves.  In order to be reactive to the needs of the business and other teams, we chose Kanban over Scrum.  Some larger projects are still managed in a waterfall manner. This is out of our control.  In these cases we start development and the stories related to the project transition through various states on the board, finally ending up in a UAT/QA column, where they stay before they get released to production at the end of the project.  A project may last up to 12 months (or sometimes a bit longer).  The result is we end up with a large number of tasks piling up in that column and they all get closed off/moved to Done in one go.   Do we need to alter our definition of Done to allow us to close these stories to prevent them piling up? Do we alter the board, adding a new column to show a status of ""Ready to Release"".  Not sure if this fixes the problem, or just moves it.  If this is the answer, should this column be included in the cycle time?  The project go-live date is out of our hands.  "
593,How to schedule back and front-end developers based on story points?,"We are used to create multiple sub-tasks for each user story and provide each sub-task with an estimate in hours and assignee (back or front-end).  With the following outcome:   Total estimated time needed in hours for user story divided over back and front-end The availability of both back and front-end developers can be taken into account when user stories are placed in sprints Developers are scheduled accordingly in Harvest Forecast based on their availability and back or front-end role   Despite, we are unable to provide an accurate estimated time. That is why we want to adjust our project management:   Estimate user stories based on story points instead of hours Estimate no more sub-tasks, only the user story Switch to Trello or Jira instead of Redmine Planning to do more Scrum activities   Daily stand-up Sprint review Estimate story points for user stories with entire team    When we apply all this, we will most probably achieve a more accurate total estimate for a sprint and plan a feasible amount of work in a sprint based on the velocity.  We only have one problem. If we no longer use sub-tasks for the estimation, we also do not know how many hours a back or front-end developer needs to be scheduled in Harvest Forecast.  Hence the question: how to schedule back and front-end developers based on story points?  Related:   Why use story points instead of hours for estimating? Why use both story points and hours? Best measurable units for non cross-functional team estimation How to estimate accurate velocity when team members are on leave  "
594,How much time should be given for investigating bugs/user stories for a sizing session,"How much time should a developer spend on investigating bugs/user stories for sizing in a sprint?  Currently we have 2 sizing sessions and a developer has time (time-boxed at 5min) to investigate and tell the team in the sizing session what needs to be done/looked at/remember etc.  So, how long should a developer spend on that investigation? "
595,No Checkpoint Reports,"I am running a Prince2/Waterfall project that is currently about 1/4 of the way through a 8 month timeline. I have been having trouble with Work Package owners not providing me with Checkpoint reports/completing the work.  This is an extension of my question here, which can provide some additional background No / Late Checkpoint reports.  Without these Checkpoint reports I don't know the up to date status of the whole project and that in turn means i cannot properly manage the project/report to the Project Board etc. How would you suggest I call out/manage this? I am interested in the more technical project management side of things.  I have included some options lower down in this post and to help you understand them better i will describe the high level project structure.  High Level Project Structure  Project Board:   Sponsor = Client, Snr Supplier = My company, Snr Users (2) = My company. This is where a sanitised view of the project is presented/discussed. It may seem odd that that Snr Users are also from my company and not the client but thats how it is. In actual fact the Snr Users are the Work Package owners. Not the most ideal situation, but its a fact at this stage and will not change.   Project Steering Committee:    Made up of the Project Board minus the client (Sponsor) plus a Senior PM.  This is a internal group, somewhat hidden from the client.  This is where the PM can disclose the true state of the project   I report to both the Board and the Steering Committee.  Here are some options I can see:   Report to the Project Board (as a significant issue) that the Senior Supplier is not delivering and let the Project Board, especially the Project Sponsor put the pressure on the Senior Supplier.  Thoughts on this approach:    I work for the Senior Supplier, and they will not appreciate this (I would be disciplined or fired i expect) I should represent and support the company i work for (assuming no ethical lines are crossed) Would potentially solve my problem as there would now be a consequence for not providing Checkpoint's/completing work, so the Work Package owners would (hopefully) lift their game.  Put the project into exception.  Thoughts on this approach:   I'm not sure that this the best/appropriate approach to call it out using project management techniques? I could only report this to the Steering committee (see option1) and I am not expecting anything to come of it (Low company project management maturity and interest in it).  I don't see how I can put the project into exception only for one group.  Report as an issue to Steering Committee, record Steering Committee's decision in minutes/decision log (continue to do this throughout project)  Thoughts on this approach:   I'm not sure that this the best/appropriate approach to call it out using project management techniques? It provides an audit trail to protect myself to some extent It puts me in the potentially difficult situation of concealing the true status of the project to the Project Board (Client).  This is kind of the same as option 5 except to call out/report to the Steering Committee and document the path of what has gone on (I can inform the powers that be, but if they choose to continually ignore then thats their choice). This is the option that is closest aligned to what I am currently doing.  Do nothing, let things continue as is.  Thoughts on this approach:   I may go insane ;-) I don't think its the professional thing to do. I'm being paid to manage the project. The project will be delivered overtime, overbudget and likely with quality issues. The project may fail (by various definitions) and I may be the one held accountable.    So...  What do you think of these options? Do you have any other suggestions?  I am asking this from two main angles:   I want to manage the project in a diligent and professional way.  I want to protect myself, I have experienced similar situations where the PM was left out to dry when things have turned visibly ""bad"" for the project. I'm sure I will face this again and am keen to have some ways of dealing with it.  "
596,Who pays for learning curve?,"Should a client be billed for a certain amount of the learning curve? Should an employer pick up the tab on overhead? Should it be the developer themselves? Or perhaps a combination of all three?  I am conflicted on this - I've heard it being said both ways - that a client (or project budget) should not have to deal with the inefficiency of a lesser experienced programmer. And again I've heard it being argued that people learn on the job so projects should include a certain amount of training budget.  I usually find that I (and other devs that I work with) work off hours or weekends reading up on technology , design patterns etc, sometimes struggling with a small piece that may go beyond contingency budgets - so most projects that we work on take up a bit more of our un-billed time.  I thought I'd open it up to the PM Stack-exchange hive mind for more insight from folks with much more experience. I have posted the same question on the Programmers (non programming related) StackExchange and am interested to look at the delta. "
597,PMI: Responsibility for Scope Management,"I'm going through the PMI training videos for a CAPM. In one of them, the presenter states:     If a business analyst is assigned to a project, that individual is   responsible for defining requirements activities, taking over your   role as project manager. You may collaborate with business analysts to   obtain, document, and manage stakeholder requirements to meet business   and project objectives.   My take-away from this is as follows:   If a business analyst is assigned to the project, that individual is responsible for all requirements-gathering and definition work, including the development of the traceability matrix. If a business anlyist is not assigned to the project, all responsibility for gathering and documenting requirements falls on the project manager.   Is this correct? Or am I misunderstanding something fundamental here?  Also, if a business analyst is assigned to a project, what is the role of the project manager in reviewing and recommending corrections or changes to the requirements (in the event that the PM or team discover that they are incomplete, out of scope, or inaccurate)? "
598,Does a PM need qualifications and training?,"Does a PM need qualifications and training, or can a good PM ""grow"" and ""evolve"" into the role based on just good experience and observation, with no exposure to the theory? What are the risks that such an approach can introduce? "
599,User Stories structure for architectural requirenments,"Once all user stories are written down for functional requirements, we still need to define some other requirements as communication with a remote server or navigation. This whole process could be defined as As an user I want my information to be available in all of my devices or As an user I want an intuitive navigation so that I dont have to read a manual. But the work to be done is extensive enough to be captured in a single user story, which leads me to think that there is a structure for requirements like the following:   Create a communication interface to interact with server's API Define a ui navigation structure   My question would be if how do you write down specifications that are not necessary user expectation of the system? Is there any kind of ""Architectura user stories"" or similar? "
600,How to determine how good someone estimates their time?,"I am very often in an environment where the employees performing the work are constantly rolling over to new employees and these employees are allowed to estimate on their own how long tasks will take. I have found that the error in their estimates always seems to be the same. Like if Bob over estimates on task 1, he is very likely to over estimate on task 2 as well. Same thing if Jim under estimates on 1 he will probably under estimate on task 2 as well.  So my question, is there any way to perform a quick test of sorts to identify these trends before starting into actual work? This post seemed to hit some of my questions, and I like the PERT method as described by Bill the Lizard. Ideally what I would like is to be able to very quickly identify if I need to change the weights of Optimistic, Expected, and Pessimistic for that person in order to better estimate how long it will take.  Since there is such a fast roll over it seems like about the time the employee has done enough estimates/work to know how to treat their estimates they end up moving on. So, any suggestions on how to handle this? Would going with something other then PERT work better?  And PS, the fast roll over is due to it being a student driven group so it is expected that the student will leave once they graduate. "
601,When is it okay to pad estimates?,"Project Managers are expected to guess the future, a difficult task even in sciences like meteorology.  As many projects finish late (due to expanded scope, underestimated durations, etc), it is tempting to pad estimates.    When is it okay (or not okay) to do so?  Off the top of my head, it is risky to share padded estimates with project team members (as they will expand their work to fit the expanded timelines), and risky to share padded estimates with management (as they will add some padding of their own before passing the schedule upwards).  On the other hand, planning a schedule with no padding is pretty much guaranteed to lead to a late project.  Thoughts? "

606,Kanban for web agency,"We use Kanban since a couple of months and have some difficulties to implent it 100%. Nowadays, we use it more as a todo list than a real Project Management System. You will find below some of my biggest questions on which I could find an answer by myself :   How should we create a Kanban card ? We don't have the typical ""As a User, I want _____"" but we do wireframes, mockups, HTML/CSS Integration, etc. This is why I thought to create my cards only with the title ""Home page"" so that it can go through the all Kanban board. Then there is the problem that the card can be an XL (1, 2 or 3 days) I am also a bit afraid as PM to give up my calendar. How can I be 100% Kanban (I mean flexibel) and have clear deadlines from my client ? For Example : ""we want wireframes on the 10th August and mockups on the 10th of September. We thought about sessions like 2 days per week is for client meetings, the rest is only production. Also as an agency (12 people), we have a lot of projects at the same time and we are not focussed on 1. Should we do small teams of think more about ressources than person ? Me as PM should maybe not say ""Michael will do the design of this website"" but ""One of the designer or together should do it, they have 40 hours, that's it"".   Thank you for your help !  Greetings from Europe ! "
607,Strategies for Managing vs. Completing Tasks as a Project Manager,"   Possible Duplicate:   Should a PM also be a resource on the project? Why?       When you're a project manager, you tend to spend (at least with larger projects) the vast majority of your time on project management tasks -- tracking the schedule, work complete and incomplete, holding meetings with stakeholders, etc.  But sometimes, as a project manager, you're also a team-member -- whether implicitly (eg. team lead spending 50% of his time on PM work) or explicitly, because the work just needs to get done.  What I want to know are two criteria:   How to tell when you, the project manager, need to do project work. What are the (warning) signs? Is it that there's more work than the team can handle? How to find the balance between time spent on PM work and time spend on project work. How do you know when you've found the balance? Or, conversely, how do you know if you're spending too much time on PM tasks (neglecting project work) or project work (neglecting PM tasks)?  "
608,Can the INVEST principles be found in my coffee machine user stories?,"I'm trying to better understand the INVEST properties of user stories. For example, consider these two user stories:   A coffee machine is programmable and it's possible to define different kind of products. A product has a unique name in the product list, a price, and some ingredients (for which is specified a quantity) choosing between coffee, milk, chocolate, and sugar. The coffee machine gives the user the ability to add, modify, or delete a product and creates a configuration with a list of products available to the customer. The user can choose a product and he can insert an amount of money equal to or greater the price of the product. If the amount is greater than the price, the coffee machine gives change to the user.   In these two stories which INVEST property can be found, and which cannot? From my standpoint this is what I think the answer should be:   Independent: 1 = YES | 2 = YES Negotiable: 2 = NO | 2 = NO (too many details?) Valuable for users: 1 = YES | 2 = YES Estimable: 1 = NO (too big) | 2 = YES (maybe requires more domain knowledge?) Small: 1 = NO (too big) | 2 = YES Testable: 2 = YES | 2 = YES   Am I right? Is it possible to rewrite them following the 3 C's style? "
609,Is it possible to manage an agile project with international team members?,"Some of the hallmarks of agile projects work best with a co-located team, perhaps all working out of the same bullpen where face to face interaction is the norm.  In fact, some of the principles behind the Agile Manifesto underscore this point.   Business people and developers must work together daily throughout the project.  The most efficient and effective method of conveying information to and within a development team is face-to-face conversation.  The best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing teams.    As such, it possible to run an agile project when team members are located globally? Can a product backlog on a website make up for one in the room with sticky notes? Can conference calls with team members in a given time zone make up for a stand-up meeting with the whole team face-to-face? Can a team self-organize over e-mail?   Are there any recommendations for running agile projects with a global team or do the downsides outweigh the benefits? "
610,PM techniques/tools for fixed-price 6 month client project,"I am looking for project management techniques and tools to help with the following situation.  (P.S. I know this question is technically off-topic but I felt Revisiting Tool Recommendation Questions expressed a degree of leeway. I am new to project management. I'm sure the community has a lot of useful advice for me.)  We are doing a software development project for a client which has a fixed budget (about USD 100k) and fixed time (about 6 months). I have a team of developers working on it. The requirements are clear (and I've worked with this client many times before so I don't predict big problems there.)  My question is, how can I keep this project on track in terms of time and budget? (If I go over budget then that'll be very frustrating, despite all the work we're going to put into the project, it would make more sense for me to fire everyone and just sit in Starbucks all day... I really want to avoid that!!)  I'm thinking, you can't change the past, but you can change the future. So I need to keep a track on the costs that have happened, and the predicted costs and effort in the future. And keep a constant eye on whether we're predicted to hit the time and budget constraints, and if not, try to take action. The sooner I know the more chance there is of being able to correct course; if I find out the night before the deadline we're not going to make it, it's too late to correct it.  Here's what I've considered:   Scrum. Dividing the project up into sprints. But, because I know what all the sprints are going to contain ahead of time, it's not really ""agile"". Is this a good/useful option? Use a tool such as MS Project Online, LiquidPlanner or similar, to enter all tasks and estimates. Team knows what to do, team updates estimates and tasks as soon as things change. I keep a constant eye on spent budget, predicted budget, predicted delivery date. Which tools should I look at there? Use an offline tool such as Excel or MS Project (offline). And have weekly status meetings where everyone has to update me. I have the worry that then I'll be a week behind (e.g. I've literally seen such situations; have the meeting Monday morning, on Monday afternoon a big problem is discovered, the plan is out-of-date until the next Monday, a week is lost during which preventive action could be taken). Plus nobody likes those big status meetings. Plus they cost a lot.   Bonus features I'd love:   Handling uncertainty somehow, e.g. a screen in the framework we already know can be predicted reasonably accurately, a piece of research less so. Ideally ""min 0.5 days, expected 1 day, max 5 days"" or something. Real world estimates such as ""1 day of effort"" as opposed to ""7 story points"" I don't have to spend ages moving Gantt bar charts around the place. Ideally I say ""this takes 1 week of effort, and can't be started before this other task finishes, and this person is on holiday on those weeks"" and the tool tells me if it'll be done by the deadline or not. Dependencies, critical path analysis, so I know which work to look at in case we're not going to meet the deadline. Display of how long people have got work for e.g. ""Bob runs out of work in 2 weeks, Joe in 3 months"", so I can decide who should take on new tasks. ""what if analysis"" like ""if I add another developer to the team, will it help the deadline, assuming we have to train them, and maybe development isn't on the critical path""? Ideally web based. Not PC/Mac based; so it's cross-platform for my team, and ideally not paper-based to support people who aren't always working from the office. Generate reports with nice KPIs such as what % of the project we're through to present to the client. (Nice to have) Tool is not slow and difficult to use and annoying. (Nice to have)   I don't mind about cost, if I can avoid a financial disaster with this project then I'm happy to pay for it!  EDIT/ADDITION:  Thanks to Erik for the question ""What kind of action are you going to try and take, if the project has fixed budget, fixed time, and fixed scope?"" Here's what I was thinking:   I can ask the client for more time. It might be OK for the client or it might not be but it's worth asking. It's never ideal to ask for more time, but if I have a 6 month project and I ask for 2 extra weeks in the middle, I think it sounds more professional than if I ask for those 2 extra weeks the night before the deadline. And if the client is doing marketing activities based around the deadline, it might really be no problem to postpone them 4 months before the deadline, but be a real problem to postpone them if you let them know a few weeks before the deadline. I can ask the client for more budget, or to reduce scope. Again, far from ideal! But I've done it, and it does sometimes work. Again, doing it with months still to go allows for a better conversation with the client than the night before the deadline, where some of the features the client might offer to drop have already been developed (so dropping them would now no longer help). Reduce exploratory work. Maybe the team is spending time exploring new technologies (e.g. new software frameworks or whatever). Such things can help the project, or not, one doesn't know at the start, if they're time they're definitely worth investigating. I can terminate such activity and assert we'll use technologies we already know. (This example comes from my actual experience.) Potentially put other people on the project, if it's just a question of time and not cost. Always a risky move. But, at least it's an option if there are months still to go. It's not an option if there's only two weeks to go. Better to know about the problem sooner than later.   Discovering risks as soon as possible seems to make sense to me. You're going to make better decisions the more information you have (i.e. it's better to know it's going wrong 2 weeks in, than not to know.) "
611,how to handle multiple project managers?,"I am a team leader.   My team handles multiple projects. Each has a different project manager.   Our priorities keep changing according to deals the company is about to close.   The project managers are not synchronized and whenever I talk to one PM I have to explain why other tasks of other projects were declared as more important than his/her project.   I need to create an environment for a changing work-plan (deadline, design, priorities etc..) and that will keep all my project managers synchronized.    How can I set this kind of work environment?  Who is supposed to synchronize parallel work-plans for different projects? Is it the project managers or the RnD manager?  "
612,Agile methodology for small company; large projects + ticket maintenance,"I just joined an IT small company that was looking for a project manager. We produce one project at once; that is, we start something, we develop it, we test it, and once it's done, then we think of another one.  For this reason, I implanted Scrum, as projects usually take months. However (and fortunately) previous projects are working well, therefore receiving tickets and... ""issues"" that just come out.  Please, consider that we are a small team (8 people in total currently) and I cannot assign only one person for tickets (it depends on each one's skills). As far as I've seen in many books and articles, Scrumban would fit our needs; that is, Scrum and Kanban combined.  What do you guys think about it? Could you just give me small brief about how would it be in the day by day work?  Thanks. "
613,Scrum Project Management Methodology strategy for working towards a fixed deadline,"Question  Is it valid and possible to cope fixed unmovable deadlines into Scrum?    I guess it is just confusing to me because I thought one of the core principles of Project Management is to help identify realistic estimates of a completion date based on limited information.  Is there a branch of Project Management, specifically Agile or Scrum Project Management that concerns the opposite, starting at the completion date and working backwards to figure creative ways to fit everything in?  Context  I am trying to understand the methodology and strategy of project management in my current company.  It is a large financial institution and there are hundreds of projects ongoing at any given time.  There is a large Program Management office that is collecting status information on many different ongoing work threads for communication of status up to executive level.  The Project Managers maintain project plans and coordinate project status information from project resources to the Program Managers.  The odd thing I can't figure out is that when a project is in conception, there is no real technical effort to determine estimates of effort or time on the project milestones.  At this phase it seems to be completely unimportant, because every project deadline are set by IT executives or by the LOB, sight unseen.  After we are told what the date will be we are then told to do formal estimation of effort (story points) rather than time because the organization has an executive mandate to be Agile and Scrum.  The weird thing is that after we identify all of the Epics and T-Shirt size everything, the Project Manager is still required to figure out how to fit all of this into the pre-determined deadline.  To do this we split and do a detailed story point estimation of a single Epic, usually a Small size, then the total story points of that are used comparatively to figure out total assumed story points.  From there the Project Manager determines velocity and proves whether all of the project milestones are achievable by the deadline.  The concept of Minimum Viable Product is non existant.  The PM has to show how many people are needed for this deadline to be possible and if it is too expensive then the project might be cancelled before it even starts.  The thing is that for the past several years nearly every project could be considered a failure because they almost never hit these deadlines regardless.  What I don't understand is that despite failure after failure, nothing substantial seems to change.  It certainly doesn't seem that being late on the project really matters in the long run.  When the project runs late then status meetings increase and general anxiety seems to increase, but just about everybody keeps working ahead as they typically do.  Other people who have been at the company for a long time have told me that their are actually two dates.  The formal deadline that goes on paper, and the date that executives actually anticipate when the project will be done in reality.  When I asked why not just make the deadline reality, they almost universally agree that executive leadership feels that when projects run late on paper then people ""work harder"".  I don't see this working for a number of reasons.  Veterans at the company don't feel the pressure because they believe there is an attempt to manipulate them into working harder.  Newer people get demoralized and stop trying.  Everybody spends more time in status meetings with anxious program managers rather than focusing on project work, and finally the nature of the work is more knowledge based and managing external dependencies than hard core work with rows of people furiously typing at keyboards until 2am.  Most everybody works a solid 40 and goes home regardless of pressure because often staying late wont get real roadblocks done any sooner. "
614,How to motivate high performers in team?,"Two months back I was asked this question in an Amazon interview:     How will you motivate the High performer in your project?   My answer, which I follow on the ground level:   There are different motivations for different people. The top motivations for high performers I can think of are:  a. For some, challenging tasks will be a high motivation or giving more responsibility is a high motivation.  b. For some, constant appreciation/reward is motivation.  c. For some, travel is motivation. For some, appraisal/promotion is motivation.  d. For some, team leading or role change is motivation.  e. For some, getting training to keep his/her knowledge up-to-date is motivation. I will identify what does motivate him/her based on the above criteria and will try to align that activity to him/her after having a word with my seniors, if it is doable. If not, see when it can be done in the future and let him/her know.   He told me it is a generic answer. I tried to search more what Amazon expects and how they motivate the high performers but I did not get any pointers here? "
615,"What is a ""Driving Milestone""?","I'm quite new to the whole project management thing. I'm studying Project Libre right now. It seems pretty decent so far.   I've found this tutorial on creating and using a milestone block. This way of working definitely makes sense to me.   In the link above the author refers to ""Driving Milestones"". From reading the document it appears to me as if that means milestones where things start rather than finish. Is that the case? Does this mean I should have milestones like ""Start v0.5"" instead of milestones like ""v0.5 Complete""?  "
616,Project scheduling based on use cases or technical tasks,"We have a web project going on and there are several use cases and we're now busy scheduling the development of the project.  We're wondering what the best practices are about scheduling a project. Should we schedule our project based upon use cases or technical tasks? I know that scheduling based upon use cases is interesting for business because they can determine what each use case costs.  However, for developers this mindset is usually not very easy to follow (they think in technical tasks). Let's say they have a technical task ""Setup Java projects"", this is a requirement for each use case, so it's hard to ""convert"" this into the functional aspect of the project.  They can divide the story points for each use case, but let's say that business puts a specific use case on hold, then the project schedule wouldn't be correct anymore.  So my question; what's the best way to schedule a project? Should it be based upon the functional part, the technical part or both? "
617,How to frame 'Cancellation Clause' in the contract?,"I work for a consultancy firm and it happened (rarely) that the project got cancelled after 1 week of the day it should be starting. No work has been done, but the allocation of the developers were being made.   That being said, how should we word Cancellation Clause in the contract? Any advice?  "
618,Resource Over Allocation in MS Project,"I've got a situation where I'm planning a job running two crews on a 10 on, 4 off roster (days). This means that over a two week period, there are three days where I have both crews working. I am trying to utilise them as a single resource to allow for leveling as either crew can perform the task. If I operate them as separate resources with different calendars, tasks are put off till the resource comes back (even though the other crew can do it).  Is there a way I can allow over allocation of a resource for a three day period (reoccurring over the life of the project)? If possible, is there a way to ensure that allowing over allocation to be for concurrent tasks? putting both crews on a single task would not yield any increase in efficiency.  I'm assuming this can be done and my skills are not up to the task so if anyone can walk me through it, that would be great.  "
619,Traditional vs. Modern requirements elicitation. When each of them is more appropriate?,Traditional requirements elicitation:  –  Interviewing customers and domain experts  –  Questionnaires  –  Observation  –  Study of documents and software systems   Modern requirements elicitation:  –  Prototyping  –  Brainstorming  –  Joint Application Development (JAD)  –  Rapid Application Development (RAD)   When is it more appropriate to use modern or traditional? What kind of project?  Spontaneously I think modern method is appropriate when we want to target the time to delivery on new project. And traditional method is more appropriate for upgrade project. Is there other situations which one of them is more appropriate than the other? 
620,Project Management Gantt Tool makes All Tasks Concurrent,"All the gantt tools I have tried make all tasks concurrent, until I specify start date or dependencies. I do not yet know the start date, and not all tasks have dependencies (well not enough to fully define the sequence). I specify the recourses but if just overloads them to n hundred percent (where n is number of tasks).  Am I missing something? How can I say do one thing (per recourse) at a time?  Additional notes: Currently trying Kplato, openproj and ganttproj (previously seen problem in MS-project)  Imagine this project: Make a sandwich.  Cut bread -&gt; Butter bread -&gt;         Cut cheese        -&gt; put cheese on bread -&gt;         Cut tomato        -&gt; put tomato on bread -&gt;                                                     Put second slice of bread on top   Now this as a dependency graph is ok, there is no care as to weather you do cheese, tomato or bread buttering first, or whether the tomato is ready when you put the cheese on the bread, or weather you do tomato before cheese. So we don't want to specify any of this.  But when we add time, we can not (with one resource) do two things at once. We need it to be sequential, not to dictate the order (the dependency graph does that ), but to predict the end date. "
621,How to resolve conflicts in team work?,"Say there are two people working together. Person 1 has more knowledge and skills than person 2. Say person 2 suggests a way to do things. However person 1 sees a better way to do it. Person 1 explains to person 2 why his way is superiour. Person 1 uses his knowledge and skills to demonstrate that. Person 2 doesn’t understand it because he lacks some background knoweldge and skills. Person 1 starts a detailed explanation, but it took person 1 a long time to get this background knowledge, and he cannot explain everything to person 2 in that short time frame. Thus, in the end person 2 still may not understand it and may even perceive person 1 as argumentative.  What to do?  Option 1: Person 1 disagrees and does it Person 1’s way. Person 2 feels resentment. The quality of the product is better, but their relationship is worse. (aka bad team work)  Option 2: Person 1 agrees and does it Person 2’s way. Person 2 feels happy. The quality of the product is worse, but their relationship is better. (aka good team work)  Which is the right choice? Option 1 or option 2? Is there a 3rd option? "
622,Agile Best Practice for External Blocking Issue,"Our company is trying to adopt a more rigorous Agile methodology (including Sprints and Scrums and all that fun stuff. We even got a JIRA subscription!), and we've run into a couple issues.  The biggest one (to me, anyway, as I am frequently affected) is that we do not know how to deal with Sprint stories that are partially dependent on an external third party. Consider the following (simplistic, vague, and abstract) story:   Story: Brand Web Page for Acme Inc.  Subtasks (Story Points):   Modify Javascript for custom behavior (0.5) Create custom build paths for Acme-branded Client (1) Retrieve logo images and color replacements from Acme (??????) Add Acme images and colors to build process (0.5) (dependent on/blocked by #3) ...etc   So here's my question. If we're planning the Sprint:   How do I estimate a task that isn't mine to complete (e.g. #3 above) How do I estimate tasks that are mine to complete, but are dependent on tasks that aren't mine (e.g. #4 above) What should we do when external tasks blow their estimates (e.g. #3 above was only supposed to take them 2 days, but ends up taking them a week)? What are our options?   Thanks "
623,Why use both story points and hours?,"I'm a new scrum master for a team that is using story point estimation and hours. We do story points first during grooming and then hours during planning.  I always thought of story points as being primarily for the project manager, and hours being for the engineers (this was simply the way we had been doing things). A coworker and fellow engineer asked why we are using both.   While I read articles such as: Don’t Equate Story Points to Hours, which explains why you shouldn't use story points to hours even though they are related Or Is there any published research about story points vs time estimation? which explain that story points are more accurate for estimation.   I fail to see much written about using both of them. We estimate stories by story points which gives us a broad sense, and then we drill down how long each task will be and use the story points and hours to give ourselves an estimate. I'm beginning to wonder however if my coworker is on to something.   Is using Story Points and hours a thing? Is there any advice for or against it? I recognize it probably takes an additional 2 hours to do both (multiplied by every member of the team) and it costs a lot.   Why use both? Anyone have any experiences with this?  "
624,Can the PRINCE2 and Scrum Master Certificates be claimed as Contact Hours?,My understanding is that a requirement to apply for the Project Management Professional (PMP) certificate is to accumulate 35 Contact Hours (also referred as PDUs by other sources) prior to the application. Check this reference video here.  I was hoping to confirm whether you can claim the PRINCE2 Training (Foundation and Practitioner certificates) and Scrum Master Certificate as Contact Hours since both trainings have not been gained via the Project Management Institute (PMI). Does that really matter?   There are several supportive questions in the Site about PMP and its requirements but I haven't found references to specific certificates and their conversion into Contact Hours.  Does anybody have any guidelines to follow? How have you claimed your Contact/PDU Hours prior to  your PMP application?  
625,How do I manage resources with non-standard hours in MS-project?,"These are my default calendar options:   Default start time: 8am Default end time: 5pm Hours per day: 8 Hours per week: 40   I have two resources. Resource 1 has the standard calendar (8 hours / day) as base calendar, and Resource 2 has Calendar 1 as base calendar.  Calendar 1 has 9 hours/day. Working times: Mon - Fri 8am - 12pm, 1pm-6pm  I created two tasks. Resource 1 is assigned to Task 1, and Resource 2 is assigned to Task 2. I then entered the start and finish times for both tasks (13/7/15 - 16/7/15 for both tasks).  When I went to the Resource Usage page, Resource 1 is working 8h for all the four days of the task. Resource 2 is working 9h for the first three days, and 8h for the last day.   Why is Resource 2 only working 8 hours on the last day? Why is it not 9 hours for each day that he is working and what can I do so that he is automatically working 9 hours for every day? When I manually change the last day so that he is working 9 hours, why does it turn red?   This happens whenever I assign a resource that does not have the Standard Calendar as the base calendar. The last day will have a different number of hours. What can I do to fix this? "
626,Should developers be talking to users during Story planning / refinement?,"When you have a Product Owner who is less technical, can developers be brought into discovery with users and stakeholders?  e.g. A new project is underway and the PO is doing discovery, creating epics, user stories etc. However, the developers understand the technicalities better than the PO; should they be brought into the discussions with the users and stakeholders?  It sounds like it's not a good idea, but I have never really thought about it before and Mike Cohn doesn't really go into it in any of his literature.  "
627,"What would you call a 'static' project, i.e. one without goals","OK, so we're developing a project management software (of sorts, way wider scope) where we basically divide everything into 3 levels, organizations, projects and roles.  However, there has been some complaining that we're using the word 'project' too loosely, i.e. involving cases that do not really have any goals/endpoints. Also, it would make a lot of sense for us to separate the static project type from normal projects. Having a good label for it would also help design work.  A few cases:  1) Organization X is developing software Y for some client Z. Person A contributes in the developer role, person B as a designer and person C as a manager. This activity can clearly be called a project and the product is a piece of software.  2) Client Z outsources some static, repetitive sales work to organization X. Person A contributes as a salesman, person B handles management and person C the bureaucracy work. The product can be seen as a service, and the activity is ???  So far the top candidates are   A) Job  The problem with this is that all of the roles are technically jobs and it would seem unnatural to have a role inside a job.  B) Service  This seems wrong as service seems to be to 2) what software is to 1). What we need is what X is to 2) where project is to 1).  Other than that, we're drawing blanks, probably partly due to not being native English speakers. It's a silly issue, but something we still need to solve well.  Bonus points for the term not being overly technical. "

629,How to show secondary and tertiary critical path in MS Project?,"Is it possible to show the secondary and/or tertiary critical path in Microsoft Project? The view menu has a way to filter to only those tasks without slack (i.e. the critical path), but is there a way to show more critical paths without artificially shortening something in the real critical path?     Edit:  To Clarify based on the answers below, just increasing the slack threshold at which something is considered the critical path is not at all what I'm after for a couple of reasons.    The secondary or tertiary critical path has some arbitrary amount of float to the primary critical path. So just changing this threshold would require tedious guess and check and could change whenever the schedule logic or status is updated.  Changing this threshold would cause all three paths to be considered ""the"" critical path, with no obvious visual means of distinguishing them from each other.   "
630,"What's the relationship between SLDC and methodologies like XP, RAD, Scrum, etc.?","I'm confusing with the System Development Life Cycle Methodology with other Methodologies like Extreme Programming, Rapid Application Development, Rational United Process, Waterfall, V-Shaped, Spiral, Agile, SCRUM and so on. The phases/stages they have are quite similar like the System Development Life Cycle Methodology.  Are they related to each other? Are they consider the same as System Development Life Cycle Methodology?  Is there any other Methodology that is not related to System Development Life Cycle Methodology?

631,MS Project 2010 Auto-calculating and setting Resource % Allocations,"been thinking about how to do this, maybe it requires a macro?  Scenario:  Resource A is allocated to Task 1 @ 50%, and Task 2 @ 50% for the same week. I now want to change the Task A allocation to 80%, which updates Work to 32hours, and want Task 2 to auto-update to 20% (and the respective Work to 8). Is this doable? Using leveling doesn't reallocate percentage but instead lengthens tasks.  Also appreciate that a particular difficulty is if Resource A is allocated to more than 2 tasks e.g. Task 1 @ 30%, Task 2 @ 30% and Task 3 @ 40%: if I update one, how does it take percent allocation from the other two?

633,What problems can be diagnosed from a Scrum Cumulative Flow Burnup?,"Useful charts for a Kanban system shows how to read a Kanban cumulative flow chart.  I am wondering what patterns stand out on a Scrum cumulative flow burnup?  I've seen two patterns frequently: the hockey stick and the bottleneck.  What other problem behavior can show up in a flow burnup, and what can be done to correct it?  Also, what intermediate states may be fruitfully charted other than In Development and In Testing?    This example uses mock data; see How can we avoid finishing all stories on the last day of a sprint? for a real-life example and some great discussion.

635,Should sprint backlog have MoSCoW prioritization applied?,"Scrum states that the team should commit to delivering the stories in the sprint backlog. It is implied that once they have reached this limit, no more items are added to sprint backlog.    Should the sprint backlog be openly prioritized using MoSCoW method?  So that the product owner's expectations for X% of the spring backlog tasks were as follows:   0-60% - Must have stories  61-80% - Should have stories  81%-100% - Could have stories  100%-120% - Stretch tasks (for team to do if they move exceptionally fast)   From what I can see, this approach benefits from:   Automatically building feature contingency into sprint estimates Giving team option of over achieving through stretch tasks   However, this approach complicates the concept of teams committing to delivering the whole sprint backlog.  Does anyone have any input on the advantages &amp; disadvantages of this approach to sprint planning?  Or experience implementing something similar? "
636,Temporarily adding external freelance developers to an existing developer team (aka. Hybrid Team). Pros and Cons?,"What are the pros and cons of adding external software developers to an existing developer team for a small project? What are the pros and cons?  For me:  Pros:   Development should in theory be faster overall than the existing team As good devs are hard to find for employment, it is an option to get developer power fast Maybe good constructive input from the external devs, as they are new to the product   Cons:   Expensive Not sure who will be responsible for the code of the external devs External devs need to learn about the existing code. Someone needs to constantly check what they´re producing, so they don´t build their own parallel product in the existing product Much more need for code review, talking, meeting, refining product concepts   So all in all, I think it could work for bigger, new parts of the product. For something small that takes an existing dev 2-4 days, it will be not worth it to school the external devs how to do it.  What are your pros and cons? Do you have some real life experience with this kind of 'hybrid teams'? Please share! "
637,When it is time to do poker planning - during Story Time or during Sprint Planning,"While doing scrum when it is time to do poker planning - during Story Time or during Sprint Planning? If it is during Story Time, then the only thing to do in Sprint Planning is to select stories for Sprint Backlog and write down tasks for each user story? "
638,How to write a proper Vision Document for a Scrum project,"As the Scrum Framework is built interactively, I'd like to know if Scrum offers specific guidelines to define the Vision Document, which is usually defined based on the utmost client need.  How should the Product Owner build up the Vision Document? Is there any defined set of principles to be followed? "
639,How do I handle a personality conflict between a vendor and customer's employee?,"Is there a recommended process for handling two people from different teams who cannot get along? Should I start with their managers, and work my way down? It seems like a simple problem that requires a simple solution, but the office politics involved makes it much more complicated than I anticipated. I have already attempted one on one meeting with both men, with no success. "
640,How to deal with non agile teams,"We are currently facing this problem in a scrum team.  Imagine you a have a user story with a front-end part which calls a webservice to get some data. Imagine that your scrum team do back-end,front-end and testing but the webservice part is done by another team in another country and you can't expect this WS to be delivered in the current sprint so the US can't be finished.  The question is how do you reflect this in the process, some ideas:   Split the US with Front Part + WS part. And try to put forward the WS in an early sprint. (Acceptance Criteria of the whole US should be defined at the time de WS story begins). Do you set Story points to this WS techical story? Do not Split, start in the sprint N and end the user story in N+1 or N+2... How do you plan capacity of sprint with this kind of stories. Any other approach?   Important note, we can not abuse of using the other team, so we can not split the ws by a light version and then a more elaborated version.   Thanks. "
641,Managing Internal projects as if the manager was a client. Does this method have a name?,"As a manager in a company, I found that some people within my team performs better when they are trusted with a task and when I manage them and the tasks I give them, like if I was a client. I debrief them, tell them what I want, give them deadlines, etc. then their mission is to come back to me with a project proposal, a breakdown of the deadline, deliveries, etc.   I was wondering if this type of management has a name? If the benefit of managing projects that way has been studied? Also if this has somehow been formalized by anybody (for example how do we organize follow up meetings with the team in charge of project, deliveries, etc.). "
642,Automating processes within your organization?,"Case:  My company deals with creative tasks, which by default are difficult to automate:   graphic design video editing / post-production audio composition &amp; sound effects   On the other side, for about 8 hours/day we have:   7 computers   that essentially produce nothing during the night time.   There are many macro scripts that can automate certain processes, so that the computers can be used during the night time. A few examples include:   Creating videos with infographics from Excel spreadsheets (video) Applying actions to multiple photos using Photoshop Action Scripts  (graphic design) Batch processing (audio)   There are also certain operations within the creative tasks that could be evaded by using templates.   Questions:   How do you manage to automate repetitive tasks within your organization/processes? What would be your strategic approach to creating value by using both human  and CPU resources? Steering the business into the usage of human creative tasks or automating as much processes are possible, depending on the computing power? Would you prefer working with people or machines?   Edit:Please, use the case just as a reference point to answering these questions about repetition and change management in the context of Project Management. "
643,What is the quarterly report called after fourth quarter?,"First of all, I apologize for such a minor question. I am not sure if this is a suitable platform for this. I am responsible for submitting quarterly reports for a project. I am doing this since last year. I had submitted fourth quarterly report few months back. Its time of the year when I have to submit another report. I am unsure about what should I name this report as. Is this fifth quarterly report? Or is this first quarterly report for the second year of the project. Could you please guide me on this ? "
644,Is it a good Scrum practice to use large story-point numbers for effort estimation?,"Is it generally a good practice to have large story-points for user stories in a sprint? We are following a modified Fibonacci series of 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 20, 40, 100. We estimate the effort considering only the complexity involved, and it's all relative. So, would it be okay to have effort estimates larger than 20, or is it recommended to have less than that? "
645,How to use MS Project to plan Bachelor degree modules,"In an attempt to keep abreast of all prerequisites for my bachelor degree, as well as the grades and GPA, I have decided to put all the data in an MS Project file.  There are certain modules which consist of 3 practical elements, each must be passed in order to be granted entrance to the exam. Some practicals also count toward the final grade.  Certain modules serve as prerequisites for others.  I would also like to break up each module into individual study sessions by topic i.e. Physics 101: 1D, 2D, Electrical Circuit etc.  Also: I am not studying linearly as most do, but as I am working, I try to fit the modules around my work schedule and am having trouble keeping on top of things.  Is MS Project a realistic method for this?  Right now I have organised into the following hierarchies:   Basic Main Thesis   With each divided into their relevant semesters  Basic -Semester 1 -Semester 2  Main -Semester 3 -Semester 4 etc.  Semester 2  - Mathematics 2  - - practical  - - - exam  Etc.. along with an overview of the topics to be learned for every subject.  Some of these don't have deadlines, they just need to be done, whereas others, such as homework and practicals, have deadlines.  How do I reconcile all this? "
646,MS Projects show task always in timesheet,"I am currently using Microsoft projects 2016 with time sheets. How can i create a task which is always shown in my time sheet with 0 planned work time? I have administrative tasks beside my project tasks which I can't plan on an explicit date. I have already tried to do this with an administrative time category, but this is shown for every user. Is this currently supported? How could I implement this feature by myself through an add on? "
647,Why does the WIP limit for a kanban discipline apply to completed work?,"In kanban, there is a hard work-in-progress limit that stops a discipline working on too much at once. In this example kanban board, the WIP limit includes work listed in the ""done"" column.  Why, for example, can the analysis discipline, which has concluded one of its tasks, not pull another task from the Next column and begin working on it? What if analysis completes all work but development still can't pull any? Should they stop working?   This doesn't seem like an efficient way of working. You can say, ""management should make sure development aren't holding up flow"", but when this occurs for the first time, management are going to ask analysis to break their WIP limit while they try to improve development, not down-tools to hold to some process ideal. "
648,How to convince upper management of the need for agile software?,"Recently I've moved into a new company and I am leading a team without any agile etc. I came from an agile environment and pair with great tools such as Jira with their cool feature such as Kanban board and also the Scrum. I'm thinking to implement Scrum so that the team has a great working culture.  Currently the new company where I'm working is using a software application called bitrix24 which doesn't have support for Agile methodology. My question is how to propose a change to the upper management, to purchase new software to accommodate the agile methodology.  What is the best approach to the upper management to purchase a new software? How to get buy-in?   "
649,Helping leadership keep up with quickly moving projects,"I lead the software development team at a mid-sized company. We follow an agile methodology with 3-week sprints, and use TFS for tracking all of our work. After considerable trial and error, I've been able to create a system that allows my team to stay on top of their work, while also producing live progress reports for upper management. For context, the progress reports update automatically every 30 minutes, and they also are saved as PDFs to a shared folder every day at 7am.   The problem I keep running into, however, is that my CEO and VP are in the habit of printing out the progress reports, then referring to the hard copy rather than the live reports. I've been in update meetings where our CEO has pulled out a month-old report, covered in handwritten notes and questions that were now obsolete.   How can I help upper management stay engaged with quickly moving projects? I don't think I'll be able to change their habit of printing hard copies, so is there a better way of communicating our progress and activity to them?  "
650,When are Gantt diagrams NOT useful?,"In my experience, there are some projects where using Gantt can be useful, but there are others where a Gantt becomes only a burden. What features of projects should I consider (beyond the basis of my own experience) to determine when Gantt diagrams are not useful?  I have considered the following:   When are Gantt diagrams useful? Are Gantt diagrams compatible with Agile methods?  "
651,Release Notes Best Practices,What are some tips for writing good release notes? Any best practices or examples? My audience is both my QA department and the executive team. 
652,Failed forecast: poor estimation or bad productivity?,"If the forecast of the team doesn't come true, how can I understand the reason for this?  It can be:   Poor estimation during The Planning Meeting. Reduced productivity (for various reasons) during the entire Sprint. Unforeseen circumstances during the Sprint.   Only a subjective expert estimation can be applicable to this situation (in other words, talk with the developers, and ask why their forecast didn't come true)?  Or maybe some metrics, practice or tips exist for helping to detect  the reason for this problem? "
653,PMP-ers: How does PMI recommend tracking of requirements through to project deliverables?,"Reading through PMI's PMBOK and Rita's exam prep guide this morning, I'm failing to see if and how they advocate requirements to be tracked through in project deliverables. How does a stakeholder know and verify that their requirement has been met? (or that the requirement was deferred from the project)  Mentioned is a ""traceability matrix"" that relates requirements to project business objectives and charter - but how are these requirements tracked in the deliverables - how does the WBS or WBS dictionary track the satisfaction of requirements?  ~ Kevin "
654,When is it appropriate to name names?,"As the answers on this forum have re-iterated over and over, frequent transparent communication is critical, and stakeholders should be made aware of risks and problems early and often.  As such, when (or is it) appropriate to name names in a status report to stakeholders when a given project is off track due to bad performance by a given team or team member?  How do you balance the hit to the working relationship versus the need to draw attention to a problem that may have a broad impact? "
655,How to break down a product or organization in feature teams,"I am already read a ton of referencing about feature teams, squads and growth hacking structure.. but imo, there is still a lack of concrete examples and how to break down a product/organization in feature teams.  To give an example of a traditional website e-commerce, how we should break down the teams? I could have a feature team for example: - home page (value proposition) - showcase ( product, categories and search) - cart management - sign up - checkout  - customer account (order history, order status)  I think in that way we are customer focused. We are dividing our team in business flow.  Suggestions? "
656,How can I get the most benefit joining a team as the weakest link?,"I heard several times that the greatest way to build your career and increase your knowledge is to become the weakest in your team. I recently became one.   However, every time I ask a question or ask for help they look at me like I'm stupid, and every time I try to tell someone something, they look at me like I'm a  4 year old child.   How can I take advantage of the learning opportunities in working with people senior to me without feeling lost, stupid, and like I can't contribute? How can I fit into this workplace as the weakest link? "
657,Where should employee training fall into the project life cycle?,"Where should employee training/reinforcement of new skills and techniques fall into the project life cycle?  Is anyone able to find any studies conducted about how the end product is affected resulted if training is done on the production code during development as opposed to conducted between projects on non-production code.  My team just finished a few releases of different product variations.  We now have some lull before our cycle picks back up.  Being the team lead, I gave the team members an assignment to re-write an application (one used to gauge prospective employees) using things they've learned since joining the team.  Things expected to see was use of dependency injection, unit testable code, and use of the MVVM pattern (a C# WPF design pattern).  My supervisor found out and didn't think this was the right thing to do with this down time.  He believes that employees should learn the above things on production code/products to be shipped and that any additional learning and such should be done on their own time.  I do see the business perspective, but we currently have a product that we are about to redo from scratch because we employed this way of thinking in the past.  I don't think we should do this, as that produces code that is hard to maintain and is usually buggy.  Did I make the right call for this lull or is there something better to do with the time?  I was unsure what to search for and any studies conducted would be greatly appreciated. "
658,How to export a configuration of MS Project 2013 so that I can import it in another file ?,I have multiple projects to handle. And I make some personalized fields for one of those project under MS Project 2013.   I would like to export my configuration and use it in another file. is this possible ?  for example :    in FILE1.mpp I made a personalized field called NumberOfTasks I want to import that to FILE2.mpp without having to go through the same steps that I have done to make the NumberOfTasks formula ?  
659,Participants of sprint planning meeting - Is it essential to involve part-time team members,"I'm currently in the process of getting my team in a position to start using Scrum and Sprints within the next couple of weeks - I intend on taking on the role of Scrum Master as long as everyone on my team agrees that makes sense.  One of the members of my team only works part time, and I've been getting varying feedback as to the length and purpose of a sprint planning meeting.  One suggestion I had was breaking the sprint planning meeting across more than one day, partly so that the part time person is still able to be fully engaged during the sprint plan.  However, this takes more of the ""productive"" time away from the part time individual.  This also assumes that sprint planning is something that takes ""about a day"" to accomplish, given a two week sprint.  So, should I include my part time person in our sprint planning sessions? Or, is it my job to serve as his representative, and make sure that even though he's not present for the sprint planning, his abilities and needs are still met? "
660,Can a Scrum Master serve as a Solutions Lead and Architect all at once? What is really the downside?,"Every book/blog or Coach (and more recently, a 3 day workshop I attended) says having the scrum master serve as a solutions lead or architect is a terrible idea. Though I can't get a clear answer as to why this is.  I'm in a mid-sized yet spread-too-thin company with a 3 member team and Agile is currently being forced down our throats.  Is multitasking (not being able to function effectively in any of these three roles) the biggest downside to this? Any anecdotal evidence to share if people have attempted this? Or is there a conflict of interest (Architects and Solutions Leads swim in details, the Scrum Master just wants to make sure things get done)?  I'd like to make a strong case to the higher ups against this but I do not have enough experience (nor would I like to do a proof-by-failure experiment) to sell this to them.  Edit: Note that the other post asked about a Scrum Master being a Functional Manager (Waterfall role). This question actually asks about combining Scrum Master with two developer-centric roles (Architect and Solutions Lead) => Thereby making this question quite different. In my case, we all (entire Agile team) report to a Functional Manager who does our performance reviews, recruits, procures etc. in the traditional Waterfall manner. "
661,How should technical writers fit within a Scrum team?,"I think my company could benefit from adding a technical writer to the team; making sure our output is unified and of a high quality. For our current project we need to produce a range of documents, both internal and external with a range of technical depth.  Where should these people be positioned in a Scrum team? In our current project we have pushed documenting it (other than deep technical detail) out to the end of our sprints. Is this a sensible plan? "
662,SRS for an Agile project,"Currently, I am drafting a SRS ( Software Requirement Specification ) doc for an agile project, and the samples are the ones used in a waterfall project. I did google a lot but couldn't find any right one. I have been part of an agile project before as a developer and also understand the working mechanism but never made the document before. Especially, areas like the scope which varies in terms of sprints.  My question is if some body can share any sample SRS for Agile projects? What kind of details need to be presented from agile project perspective in the scope and milestone section?  Update: Although the SRS is not mandatory but we have a fixed price project that needs to have a fixed timeline on the basis of the effort application. Hence need to document the requirements that need to be worked out along with the possible timelines. Apart from all this, the project needs to be executed from an Agile approach as discussed with the management hence it will most probably be a subsequent transition to a complete agile approach from the approach that we are executing currently. Having said that under current circumstances should I go for an SRS doc or something custom "
663,Show Epic label in backlog without adding Epics to board filter in Jira?,"There doesn't appear to be any medium here but I have a Kanban board in Jira and all issues are assigned to an Epic. The filter specifically does not include Epics because in Kanban if Epics are included in the filter Jira adds them to the list of work (undesired in my case.) In Agile boards, the Epics do not appear in the backlog.  This is the bahavior I want, however, if I remove epics from the filter, it will not show the Epic tags on the Kanban board. The Jira documentation mentions the only fix for this is to include Epics in the board filter. Is there any workaround to this? Is it possible to create another type of Agile board that does not show Epics but also is not running off of sprints? It's highly annoying that this is an all or nothing thing. It doesn't make sense they have functionality for one board but not the other. Perhaps another type of sprint-less board will work? "
664,How to structure a scrum team to build native iOS and Android mobile app that needs backend development?,"Here is the scenario:   I have a mobile app that should be developed for Android/iOS/Windows.  The app has similar features but with different design per OS. It also needs backend/web development as well to provide some APIs. Those APIs are almost identical.   What is the best practice here to form the team using Scrum platform?   Should I make separated projects for each of the backend APIs, iOS, Android and Windows apps and make them work on parallel?  If so, how to manage the dependencies per app and the backend? Should the backend guy attend the daily scrum meetings for the iOS, Android and Windows apps as well?  Or I make them one project and with the aim that each feature takes the same time to be developed in the sprint on each OS?  "
665,How can we mitigate uncertainty about project estimation in the initial phase?,"According to Boehm’s Software Engineering Economics, during the project initiation, estimates can be off by as much as 400%.  However, in order to make the sale, account managers are expected to make on-the-spot estimates of the project duration. The result is that we end up with a number of unrealistic schedules which we are contractually obliged to stick to.  The schedules tends to be underestimated, since there is a feeling here that if we quote too high, the project or the tender will simply be snapped up by another company.  What strategies exist to mitigate that uncertainty? Are there standard contracts that sell an initial requirements extraction phase to better understand the requirements before making a long term estimate? "
666,tracking and progress in a Kanban,How can we measure the progress of a task in Kanban? Also will there be an estimate for a task or is it simply saying that focus on the task and finish it rather than sticking to the deadline ? 
667,How should a project manager capture decisions?,"As a project goes through the planning and design phases, many decisions will be made.  To develop with technology X instead of technology Y. To leave feature z off of the plan for this version of the release in order to hit a hard deadline.  Many decisions, large and small (and sometimes the decisions about what will not be done are as important as decisions about what will be done).  How can a Project manager best capture and share the decisions that were made so that they are not continually revisited throughout the project? Should the ""why"" and the ""who made the decision"" be documented as well? How should the project manager balance the  communication of key decisions without overwhelming uninterested parties with minutiae? When is it okay to revisit a decision that seemed like a good idea at the time, but does not bear out in practice? "
668,Which features of user story management should an agile team look for?,"In my research study, I need to identify the key features of user story management tools that can be used to support agile development. So far, I identified the following general groups of features: User role modeling and personas support, User stories and epics management, Acceptance testing support, High-level release planning, Low-level iteration planning, and Progress tracking. Each group contains some specific features, e.g., support for story points, writing of acceptance tests, etc.   Which features of user story management should an agile team look for especially when switching from tangible tools (index cards, pin boards and big visible charts) to a software tool? Are some features more important than the others? Many thanks in advance! "
669,"Am I not organized, or have I put too much work on myself?","I am a member of a team of programmers. We do not have a real boss as we work as a group. Each member of a group took non-programming tasks on himself as well, which mainly means that they do testing and coding. It's a 10-hour-a-day job.   Now, since I am the most talkative and experienced person on the team, I got more management tasks and cut my programming to the minimum. When the day ends, I feel like I need 40 hours rather than 10 in each working day.   I have been asking myself if I am not well organized, or if I took too many tasks upon myself. I will list all the roles I have in our team so maybe someone can reply to my question.  My roles are:   a person who talks to clients a person who seeks clients (newspapers, friends, old clients, etc.) a person who writes project specifications for the ongoing projects a person who does project management by assigning tasks to other colleagues and monitors their progress (then reports it to clients) a person who seeks new contractors when some project or part of it needs to be outsourced, interviews them and makes/choose quality tests a person who does minor (1-2 hours) fixes in the projects   Does this seem like too much for one person? When I look at this list it doesn't look like too much to me. If it's too much, which part needs to be assigned to someone else? "
670,What to do when capacity is reduced in the middle of the Sprint? (e.g. Sick Leave),"A developer had to take unplanned days off in the middle of the Sprint, causing an impact of less hours in the original capacity. It is possible to measure this in hours (e.g. 2 days = 16 hours).  So, where and how can I use this figure to improve my insights about the sprint progress? How can I identify the likelihood of the sprint being still completed using this new information? Should I add this to the burndown, like when there is change of scope by adding tasks in the middle of the Sprint? "
671,How can I reward hard work without a budget to do so?,"A similar question discusses cash, presents, and parties as good ways to reward project participants after successful completion of a project.    On smaller projects without a budget, and with participants that are not local, are there any ways to express appreciation and maintain a good relationship with the participants so that they will look forward to participating on the next project?  A private ""thank you""? An e-mail to their manager with praise?  Any other ideas? "
672,How to implement SCRUM without forgeting the four principles of the agile manifesto on the way?,Don't the four agile principles get a bit lost in the middle of all the SCRUM process? How can this be avoided? How to promote these four principles over the process that is imposed? How to make the technical staff aquire a more value-oriented mindset and act in more assertive manners instead of turning them into drones? 
673,MS Project 2010 Finish Date changes unexpectedly,"I am using MS Project 2010.  My Task Type is defined as Fixed Work.  I have tried Fixed Duration and it only seemed to make the matter worse.  I have a task that spans 10 days (2 weeks).  However, the task is only estimated to take 20 hours.  At the end of the first week 13 hours of work was completed.  Although there is still another full week to complete the remaining 7 hours of work MS Project changed the Finish Date on the task, adding one day to it.  Why?  How can I prevent this from happening?  "
674,Agile methodology for small company; large projects + ticket maintenance,"I just joined a small IT company that was looking for a project manager. We produce one project at once; that is, we start something, we develop it, we test it, and once it's done, then we think of another one.  For this reason, I implanted scrum, as projects usually take months. However (and fortunately) previous projects are working well; therefore, receiving tickets and... ""issues"" that just come out.  Please, consider that we are a small team (8 people in total currently) and I cannot assign only one person for tickets (it depends on each one's skills). As far as I've seen in many books and articles, Scrum-ban would fit our needs; that is, Scrum and Kanban combined.  What do you guys think about it? Could you just give me small brief about how would it be in the day by day work? "
675,Drawing Architectural Diagrams Before Building Software,"I don't know I am posting this question. in the right place. I thought I could post it on stackoverflow but this places looks more suitable for this question.  I am wondering that how much drawing a a blueprint/sketch of the architecture of a project before starting to actually build it would help? could it be useful? what are your experiences on this. I am about to dive into a big project on my firm and I just wanna explore the options before getting into it.  Also, is there some online tools which are specifically designed for that kind of purposes so that I can do this kind of stuff on my machine instead of on a paper. "
676,Is there a standard job title for someone who does project admin without making important decisions?,"I'm working as a technical PM on a software project. The decision making and technical demands are such that day-to-day tasks (such as communicating properly with the customer) are suffering.  We want to bring in someone in order to unburden me of some admin responsibilities such as:   Organising meetings Taking and distributing minutes Formalising action points and chasing people to do them   In other words, leaving me to manage the internal side of the project and discuss with the client, with them responsible to keep all parties (me, project owner, client) informed and accountable.  Is such a role widely understood to exist? Would we describe them as a Project Administrator? PM Assistant? Junior PM? Or is this basically a PM and I need to redefine my job title? We need to advertise and as such ensure we describe the title and role correctly to attract the right people. "
677,I need project management experience to get into a project management role but no one will hire me. Can anyone help?,"Good Afternoon All,  My name is Edriss and I have acquired my certificate in Project Management from UC Berkeley on July 2017. I have been looking around the web to find an entry level role in project management but discovered that there are no such things as ""entry level"" roles in project management as all roles require a varying degree of experiences (ie. varying years of experiences). I have also looked into unpaid internships but have also been unsuccessful thus far. All entry level roles literally ask for at least 3 years of experience as a project manager in my area. So my only question to this community of project managers is:  How can I acquire valuable project management experience without an official role (job)?   Could anyone help me out here as I am a newcomer in the world of PM?  -Edriss "
678,"In a data-driven startup, what should we *not* A/B test?","We are shifting our startup to a data-driven culture, and prioritising what to start testing [UPDATE: i.e. what goes in the product plan]. We have a reasonable number of users, and a working product, and a large backlog of bugs and ideas :)  However, we're struggling with one thing: how should we decide which changes we should just do, rather than including them in A/B tests.  Examples:   It seems fairly clear that bug fixes should just be deployed, and don't need to be A/B tested. Correct? What about documentation improvements? Should we be A/B testing those, or should we deploy them? What about UX changes that we have strong qualitative evidence (support requests, user testing) are barriers for users, and that just take an hour or two to fix? What about UX changes / new features that a paying customer has asked for, but that we don't have any other qual evidence for?   We're having a debate internally about whether it's OK to ""just do"" some stuff, especially where it's ""obviously an improvement"" like a bug fix, or whether the time taken to do it is small.   Or whether that's dangerous, and we need to test everything.   The trade-off is that running multiple A/B tests at once gets complex, and clearly sometimes the opportunity cost of adding a new test, waiting for the results, and doing the work to understand the results (which means we can't do other things) is more than the potential benefit/downside of shipping the change.  I've read ""The Lean Startup"", and ""Lean Analytics"", but both are pretty vague on this. Both say you should be using design intuition and qualitiative testing at times, but don't give advice on when you should rely on those vs quant testing.  How do other startups handle this? "
679,Management by Walking Around (with a remote team),"Management by Walking Around (or Wandering About) is an extraordinarily effective (yet simple) way to keep your finger on the pulse of your team, to build relationships, and hear about problems and concerns early on.  Easy enough to do over coffee with a local team, but how would you go about implementing this concept with remote team members? Can you have the same impact with a phone call, e-mail or video chat? "
680,A software development workflow for a company of 2-4 developers?,"I work in a research group of an architecture firm that contains around 4-5 developers at any given time. We develop a lot of the in-house architecture software, and our skillsets range from C#, to Java, to PHP, to most of the major web languages (like JS, HTML, SQL, etc). We are definitely a group of transdisciplinary skills. Our work involves not only working on software, but also communicating with the architects within the firm to better improve current software and develop new tools.  As the number of developers increase, and as the result of us just releasing a new piece of software for commercial release, we noticed that we definitely need and definitely will need a new way to manage our team. That is, to coordinate projects, to monitor/track changes (git, or any version control), to manage features, and much more. As we are a team of many skills, I am the only developer in the team that came from an actual software development team. Tools I used in my previous gig was project management software like JIRA, Confluence, HipChat, git, and more. However, my previous company was a firm of 100+ developers, while this team is only 4-5, so using JIRA, for example, would be overkill.  I am in need of some help and suggestions. What type of project management software can we use to track the things I listed above? What type of workflow can we adopt, i.e. Agile, Scrum, etc? "
681,Use Case: Postcondition vs Expected Outcome, Is Expected Outcome interchangeable with Postcondition depending on your use case structure?    Should Expected Outcome and Postcondition be explicitly differentiated from each other?   Say I have a snippet of the use case of withdrawing money from an ATM (agrees to issue receipt):     Description: This use case describes how a Bank Customer uses an ATM to withdraw money from their bank account   Basic Flow:   Customer inserts their bank card into the card reader of the ATM   ...   System ejects the Customer's bank card; the Customer takes the bank card from the machine     Should the Expected Outcome be:     Expected Outcome: The ATM dispenses the requested amount of the Customer     or      Expected Outcome: The Customer obtains cash from the machine     with the Postcondition having       Postcondition: The Customer obtains the receipt from the machine; the system records a transaction log entry for the withdrawal     I was thinking that the Expected Outcome should be the latter since it agrees with the Description while the Postcondition enumerates the activities/conditions that the system will perform upon successful execution of the use case. Am I in the right logic here? 
682,"Should the Scrum Master also be an Agile coach, or are they the same?","When answering and discussing this question an new question came to mind, first some context:  The Scrum guide states that the Scrum Master services the organisation with:        Leading and coaching the organization in its Scrum adoption;   Planning Scrum implementations within the organization;      From reading this article ""the Scrum Master is not an Agile coach"". I get the idea that the Scrum Master should only focus on the Scrum Framework and not other Agile practices, principles and values.  I tend to disagree, because I think Scrum covers only the project management part of ""being Agile"", but (for example) skips the important technical practices that make products Agile.     Organizational Agility is constrained by Technical Agility      In other words, when you are slow in making changes to your product,   then it doesn’t matter how you structure your teams, your organization   or what framework you adopt, you will be slow to respond to changes.   Can we successfully implement Scrum as a Scrum Master without also being an Agile coach? The Scrum guide states it is ""Difficult to master"". I think this is because it only handles the process and not the full cycle as Extreme Programming does.  Leading to the following question: Should the Scrum Master also be an Agile coach, or are they the same? "
683,Are Program Management skills different from Project Management skills?,"My company has a series of projects with dependencies between them (eg back end hardware refresh/virtualisation, new desktop build/roll-out, database upgrade and implementation of new functionality, new major release of existing applications, and implementation of a couple of new applications). All are significant enough to justify individual project managers, and we want to coordinate them all within a programme.  Question: Are the skills required to run a single large project the same as those required to manage a programme? If not, what are the differences, and what additional training is required? "
684,Making a budget and time plan for a software project,"Let's assume that we are starting a project, but have no previous experience of budgeting a software project.   What should the guys who will work on that project do to make a decent budget planing?  Should every movement be considered on this process?  I meant coding the structure and data access, creation of restful services, creating the database structure and architecture, and so on by every movement.  How should the time planning process go on? "
685,Program management and the value of Gantt charts when dates are predetermined,"I work for a very large organization not in the PM role that has historically had problems with project leadership and project management in general.  They have recently broken up and were reformed as now a Program Management Office (which I don't really know or understand the difference).  The impression from my colleagues is that this is merely an abstraction away from real project management so that they won't have to be directly responsible for future project failures.  Our interaction with this group is generally that they coordinate BA, Dev and QA resources to hit arbitrary dates as laid out on a Gantt chart that they generate.  Developers are never really asked for estimates by PM's but we are asked early in project initiation for a ""rough guess"" on level of effort, but even then the dates that appear on the Gantt chart don't seem to correlate with any numbers we provide.  We track hours that are put towards a project, but we do not track project resource availability in any system.  For all intents and purposes the dates on the Gantt chart appear to be arbitrary.  When I asked about this in a meeting I was told that resource availability is just not possible, but upper management insists that we all work towards a hard date as a goal, and that everybody should view these dates as merely goals to try and achieve.  That is all well and good but our direct managers ask us for real estimates after the fact and then a date that originally started as merely a ""goal"" is now an unbending unmoving high pressure deadline by our direct managers.  The presence of the PM sort of disappears later in the project.  My original thought on the purpose of the Gantt chart is to demonstrate resource availability and visualizing the Critical Path.  Wouldn't predetermined dates minimize the real value or usefulness of a Gantt chart?  Is this concept of pre determined dates on a Gantt chart a common paradigm for the field of Program Management? "
686,How to report performance of a software development project?,What metrics do you use in order to report performance of a software development project? And how do you collect them? 
687,Is there a project management methodology that is designed for small teams of 1-3 people?,"I am doing a research project on this topic for a graduate class, and I have had a hard time finding sources that specifically talk about this in detail rather than briefly mentioning it and moving on to the big project ideas.   Has there been any work done to develop a methodology geared for groups of this size? How does a single person manage his or her project most effectively? Is there a reason why it seems like there isn't a lot of attention dedicated to this topic specifically?   This is a tough subject because there is so much to it, just like the general topic of project management. My idea is that most concepts stemming from the general topic of project management will be revisited and adapted to the situation of only having a few people, at most, to accomplish the same tasks throughout the project life cycle. "
688,"Small team in large team, using two boards in JIRA","We have one large project running at the company where I work as a developer. We have developers from different teams involved (different companies even), testers, analysts and whatnot. This large project has its own Scrum board in JIRA.  My own team consists of 2 testers and 1 developer (there used to be 2 of us) and we have our own Scrum board. Our sprints run asynchronously to the main project but we do take stories from the main project. Often I will break them down into smaller stories.   Other stories on our backlog are about maintenance: upgrading existing software, removing old software, migrating to new hardware and so on. And some other stories that are not, or only loosely, tied to the main project. I should stress that the maintenance part is linked (often blocks or is blocked by) the stories from the main project.  This setup works but we do have problems because of the replication of stories from the main project's board to our team's board. I hardly ever look at the main project board and the analysts and product owner from the main project never look at ours, this has caused some unpleasant surprises in the past.  My question is:  Are we doing something inherently wrong here? If so, what would be a better approach? If not, how to fix the problems from story duplication? "
689,What are the differences between project leader and project manager,Is there any difference between a project leader and a project manager? Is their involvement different in any aspect?  What are the tasks performed by project managers?  What are the tasks performed by project leaders? 
690,What is the difference between Business/Management Consultant and Project Manager?,"I met a business/management consultant 2 months ago working in one of the top business consulting firms.  He explained to us that he, as a Business Consultant, can successfully manage projects more effectively and efficiently than a Project Manager. According to him, a Project Manager is a focused person, while a Business Management Consultant is a multi-focus expert. It helps him to do better planning, decision making, and long-term goal achievements.  I always thought a Project Manager is better than a Business Management Consultant. But now, after understanding what a Business Management Consultant can do, my opinion has changed.  I read this article and it seems like a Management Business Consultant is better than a Project Manager.  Though, not all Management Consultants are not better; only the right one.  Who is better at managing projects? A Project Manager or a Business/Management Consultant? "

692,How could Agile methodologies be used with a middle school Lego Robotics team?,"I'm a coach of a middle school Lego Robotics team, competing in our local FIRST Lego League competition. I'm interested in bringing Agile methodologies to our team. From what I've been seeing, it seems like a good fit, and would really help teach the students how things work in real world software engineering. The problem is that I'm a bit shaky on some aspects of adapting Agile to a software+hardware problem.  Here's what I have so far:   In the competition, the robot is set up on a table with many Lego structures. These make up missions worth varying number of points. The robot leaves a Base area, does something (ideally one or more missions) and returns. This sounds a lot like a ""user story"", and I'm already planning to get the students to write what they want the robot to do that way. All the missions basically become the backlog! I'm also going to use Planning Poker to estimate how hard they'll be to build and program for. Our team only meets for 1 hour per week, though. What would be the best way to set up the time estimates? I'm thinking that the smallest unit should be 1/2 an hour, and would go up from there. These missions tend to be pretty complex sometimes, and benefit from being broken down into simpler tasks. Should we worry about that when writing up user stories? (Doesn't seem so...) As coach, should I act as project owner? Or should a student on the team be tasked with determining which missions or combination of missions is most important? Given that our team is small (8 students), would one Scrum Master be best? Should that be me, or a student? Given that our team is small, is it fine for students to be testers and developers as needed? (I'd like to avoid giving them excuses for downtime.) Since we only meet 1 hour per week, would a sprint length of 1 month be best? I've also been looking at the concept of test-first design, and while it seems great, I don't understand the terminology. How would I get my students to design the robot and its programs test first? Would it even be appropriate? What kinds of tests (unit? acceptance?) would work well?   I know these are a lot of questions. Any help you all could give me would be greatly appreciated. Thanks!  (Also, if you'd like to read about this teaching experiment, I'm blogging about it at gettingteachingdone.net.) "
693,Requirement gathering cut off when the time for requirement collection is too long,"I am doing a small project. Users can only provide a part of requirements. The period of user requirement gathering has lasted for two months. But it seems we will receive no information for the rest of the requirements.   Should the project be separated into two phases? One phase to launch the system for the existing requirement. The second phase could be the ""reset requirement"" and start the second requirement when user thinks the ""reset requirement"" is ready.   Is this a common practice if requirements cannot be collected for a certain period? "
694,What to do with unexpectedly blocked story in scrum?,"We have a low-pointed story which was dev-complete but, during testing, revealed a problem. In investigating the problem it was discovered that an external party will be required to deliver a fix. The external party will not deliver that fix before the end of the Sprint. Our Story is therefore blocked until the external party delivers their fix.   Should the Story remain where it is on the Scrum board at the next Sprint Planning or should it be dropped back into the Product Backlog? If neither option in #1 is a good approach, what should be done?  "

Are there any recommendations about the best way to start introducing the basics of project management to these people?

697,Prince2 Business Options and the Contents of a Detailed Business Case,"I'm currently studying Prince2 and am working through the business case theme.  My question is about the business options in the detailed business case document, and how the contents of the business case document relate to each option.  Is it necessary to ""branch"" the business case document for each option?   E.g. For each option, should the document then proceed with going through the expected benefits, dis-benefits, timescales, costs, investment appraisal and major risks for the ""do nothing"", ""do the minimum"", and ""do something"" options?  If not, which option should these contents be based upon?  I'm interested in both the ""theoretical answer"" and what community members consider to be most practical.  In all documentation I have seen so far, the contents after the options just refer to ""the project"", but the options present different project alternatives so these contents are inherently different and refer to different projects, but the study material I've seen doesn't ever ""nest"" these contents under the different business options.  Any help is much appreciated. "
698,"What Does ""Commitment"" Look Like with Agile Projects?","When engaging with a client on a project that will be developed using agile methodologies, what is being promised in the delivery of the project? How do you know if that promise is objectively met?  Context:  In a typical client/service-provider interaction, a transaction takes place where the client asks, ""can I have a solution that helps me do X?"" Then, the provider responds with, ""yes, we can build that for you!"" The next thing the client says is, ""awesome, how much will it cost and when will I have it?"" Finally, the provider gives an answer, or a promise, to deliver.  In the traditional waterfall-managed project, as the provider, we can easily see if we've met our promise by comparing our ""committed"" timeline, budget, and scope to the actual timeline, budget, and scope.  In the agile world, where there is inherent recognition that the plan of what is going to be delivered changes, what are we actually promising when the project starts? Can it be measured?     Waterfall: ""I promise to deliver X scope in Y timeline with Z budget."" (In the hopes of solving W business need.)      Agile: ?   If I were to take a stab at it, I'd probably say:     ""I promise to help solve W business need by iteratively developing and adapting X scope within the confines of Y timeline and Z budget.""   The problem with this answer is I'm having trouble understanding how I can objectively measure whether or not this promise is met. How can I reasonably compare committed vs. actual Y timeline and Z budget if I know that X scope will change. How can I measure whether or not X' scope actually solved W business need? "
699,Is it possible to use HP Quality Center as a task tracking tool?,"In my current project, I felt the lack of a sound platform for tracking our tasks, as in my previous project we were using Atlassian's Jira.   Chatting with development managers, they mentioned that the tool they're using for 'tracking' is HP's Quality Center. As I'm not used to this platform, I'd like to ask you:  Did you have had any experiences in the past using HP QC for task tracking?  As far as I can see, HP QC offers an environment focused more on the testing phase of a release, rather than analysis / development...   Any thoughts? "
700,How to negotiate a software proposal?,"My company (western Europe) needs to outsource a project, and I received an offer from a eastern Europe software company.   The proposal consists of a main part and an optional part. The work is detailed in term of effort/day,  roles (software developer, architect etc) and phases (analysis, dev).  The hourly rate per role is given and the final budget is calculate accordingly.  What margin do I have to negotiate the offer and how do I do it?   I checked around hourly rates for eastern Europe, they look in line,  maybe slightly above than average The main dev effort is roughly split in 100 day dev, 30 days testing/QA and 10 days management/analyst. Spread over 4 months (80 days). Difficult for me to evaluate. From scratch? maybe realistic. Maybe they will use an off the shelf open source solution and will be few weeks work, I don't know, we don't have that kind of expertise in house.   I could invent some reason and write a polite email and get maybe 10% discount. Should I do that? Should I ask more detail about technical work and ask a re-estimation of effort? Will be unwise to just accept it like it is?  Should I instead focus on understanding deliverables and maybe ""asking for more"" at the same price?  If anybody can give me suggestions about evaluation criteria and negotiation strategy, thanks "
701,How do you share lessons learned from a post-mortem?,"Running a project post-mortem (or post-implementation review) is a valuable way to identify and document lessons learned from the project.   After doing so, how to best share (and act upon) those lessons learned with an organization as a whole? It is not just the project team that would benefit from the lessons learned, and too often I see the review outcomes relegated to a document library for an archived project where it is never read.   I understand some companies such as Boeing have a black book of lessons from past failures that are shared with employees... any other approaches that work well? "
702,Total Quality Management vs Project Management,"A company has a long history of being TQM oriented, now they are looking into injecting project management methodology.   The organization is comfortable using the TQM methods - especially 7-step and 9-step, how will you approach injecting the PM tools and templates?   Do they have to choose one over the other? "
703,How important are Myers-Briggs personality evaluations as a project management tool?,"As projects involve people with many different personalities (trying to) work together as a team, it it worth the time and effort to have the team participate in a Myers-Briggs personality inventory?  Does the answer depend on the size of the team? The type of the project? Should the project manager make decisions about task assignment and communication styles best on the results? "
704,How do I get started with Kanban? I have a backlog full of user stories,"I'm in the early stages of developing a new project and I'm trying to pick up and apply agile techniques. In particular I'm trying to set up a Kanban approach with the development of this project.  For my last project I familiarised myself with Atlassian Confluence and it was a pretty immense help, so I've purchased a license for Jira and Jira Agile to go along with it.  Last week I held a meeting with some other members of our company who are the de facto customers of this project since it will be used internally. I discussed all the requirements they had and turned them into a set of user stories. Here are a couple of examples:   As a developer*, I want to be able to create a test procedure which gives me control and monitoring of the motors in the test rig. As an operator, I want to be able to see the reports of tests that I run.   These user stories have been recorded in a Product Requirements page in Confluence and transferred over to a Kanban board in Jira. My board currently looks like this:    My problem is that these user stories are providing high-level descriptions for the core goals of the project. As soon as I start doing any work, I'll have automatically made progress in all of them and so I'd have to move all of them into ""In Progress"". And none of these user stories would be marked as done until I'm nearly complete with the project during which time they would all get marked as done in pretty quick succession.  It would be a lot more intuitive to me if each card on the board represented a small, simple task that was along the lines of ""Implement this small piece of functionality"" or ""Investigate if this approach is feasible"" - something I can assign to myself or someone else and expect it to get done within a few hours or days. How does an approach like that fit in with the idea of using user stories on a Kanban approach?  One thing I could do is create a series of sub-tasks for each story. The problem with this approach for me is that a lot of these tasks would be shared as a common requirement between most if not all of the user stories.  In brief, I've created a set of user stories and not sure what to do next. Have I made a mistake in creating these user stories or am I just not seeing the next step?  Edit  *by ""developer"" I meant ""test sequence developer"" i.e. one type of customer of the product. "
705,How to differentiate old bugs from new bugs during a sprint?,"In a sprint where we fix old bugs as well build new features, we will encounter 3 types of ""bugs"" in in a scrum board:   Bugs introduced by current stories Bugs newly discovered during sprint but are not from current stories Bugs previously identified and planned in backlog and are moved into current sprint to be fixed   Currently,   for (1), these are created as sub task issue type under the story to be worked on as part of the story. Stories are not done unless all sub tasks are done.  For (2), we create them as bug issue type in the current sprint so that we know how many bugs are discovered mid sprint.  Problem is with (3). Since they were bug type in backlog, when moved to sprint they continue to have bug issue type and this messes with (2).  What is the JIRA way of differentiating between old and new bugs during sprint?  I am very tempted to convert all type (3) Bugs to Tasks and Change Requests to Story at the beginning of sprint. Is this acceptable JIRA practice? "
706,How to create deliverables column in Gantt chart?,"I’m taking Intro to Project Management online and the instructor has required us to produce Gantt charts with deliverables prominently in their own column on the far right. We can use any software we want, as long as it looks good and professional. I'm a newb when it comes to the available options for Project Mangement software, and we haven't learned any of them in this course.  I presumed that given the plethora of project management software and online dashboard tools available, that adding a custom column on the right would be a fairly easy thing to do.  I know that one can do this with Excel, but isn’t this a situation of “don’t reinvent the wheel”? So what I’m wondering is how can I do this with other project management software?  What I've Tried Already  I tried the following softwares:   MS Project 2016 TeamGantt Gantt Project   I have not been able to discover how to place the deliverables at all, let alone to show them in one aligned column on the right. Also, none of them format well to fit on one page.  I also tried this link:  How to create custom fields at project level in MS Project  But, it did not provide the clear solution for my question.  Any help is appreciated. "
707,How to Plan a Project with a Fixed Management Deadline?,Take a scenario where the project deadline is predetermined by senior management and the project team is asked to execute.  Is there any methodology which can be used?  How can a project plan be created in such a case? 
708,"How do you ""project manage"" when you are the only developer?","Targets in a one man developer team?  When you are the only developer on a new startup, how do you think the project management should move forward. Because I am the only person with a technical background I am really the only person who is monitoring my progress. I'm not a slacker and would really like to enforce some kind of accountability and target based expectations on myself, but I don't know how this is really possible?  The new start up has other team members, but at the moment their role is purely supervisional and advice based (when it comes to the software development).  I'm concerned with finding techniques to accelerate my development. The industry that the software is designed for is seasonal so timeframes are of importance.    Maybe I should consider using software?      In response to the first answer, I see that I should provide more information to my question. This is the situation.   I am going to continue to be the only developer for the forseeable future and I will be working on this start up for several years. The project will see me develop software which will be used as a service. The service will care to the needs of many clients The ""needs"" of these clients is where the other people in the team comes in. They have been operating in this industry for many years.  We have already done several months of design and brainstorming I have been developing for about 7 weeks now, and will hope to have a core prototype'd demo product in about 7 more weeks.   "
709,Defect Found in Previous Iteration - Bug or New Work?,"A previous answer stated that:     On the other hand, if Feature Bar met the Definition of Done in a previous iteration, but bugs were later found after the feature was declared ""done,"" then while you may choose to log it as a bug in JIRA, from an agile perspective it's really new work for a subsequent iteration.   However, while I can see that a feature not working before the feature is considered Done is obviously just evidence that the feature isn't Done yet, I'm having trouble wrapping my head around how something not working after the feature was considered complete being anything other than a defect.  So... is there an obviously 'correct' approach (as opposed to simply being opinion-based)? And if so, what is the rationale behind it? "
710,Change of business focus after a sprint has started,"If we start a sprint with a specific goal and the user stories to support that goal, then the business changes their immediate requirements during that sprint. This may be because of a client requirement or an internal 'emergency'.  For example, we start a 2 week sprint with a number of planned tickets to reach the sprint goal. After 3 days, the business approach us with a need for some functionality not in the current sprint. This is needed to appease a dissatisfied client. There is a requirement to abandon the current goal and set this urgent work as a new one.  How do we handle this? Do we fail the sprint and start planning again? Do we insist on finishing the current sprint and do this urgent work in the next one? "
711,Is there quantitative evidence showing that processes adapted from manufacturing work  when applied to software projects?,"Most management practices derived from manufacturing were developed in an environment where measurements to the nearest 1/1000th  are common place.  Most software project strive to estimate production +/- 10%.  Given the difficulty the software world has in even simply quantifying its size, it seems translating process from the manufacturing world to the IT world must be done with care.  Does any publicly available quantitative evidence exist that shows the impact of implementing manufacturing-style process on software project where it did not previously exist?  I'm not picky about the process, could be Six Sigma or something I've never heard of as long as its source was originally manufacturing. "
712,"Product Owner is requesting a ""confidence check"" for reaching the MVP - How to in a Scrum project?","We're in a quite complex software engineering project with lots of unknowns due to new technologies involved that the Team has never applied nor have comparable experience.   Due to these risks the Product Owner (PO) requested a ""confidence check"" of if the Team will reach the minimum viable product (MVP) by a certain deadline this year. Since ""deadline"" and doing Scrum clash quite a bit, the Team was really hesitating to give the PO an answer.   The PO required to have this indication for a CEO's report; thus, all had to rate it; there was no way around. So I took the rating as part of a Retrospective. We're in Sprint 2 of 8; the real velocity is not clear to the Team yet.  He asked the Team to vote 1 - 5 regarding these phrases:   5 - Yes, I'm confident. There is a clear and transparent path forward to achieve the MVP.  4 - Yes, I'm confident but the path forward is not fully transparent to me.  3 - Yes, I'm fairly confident that we can make it happen but I see some risks.   2 - No, I'm not confident anymore. There are too many obstacles.  1 - No, I'm already convinced that there will be a delay.   Here's the result I'd like to share. The Dev Team is quite large, since we have multiple streams - some votes are also from people of an extended Team.    I'd like to get your opinions on this.   How do you see this situation?  Is this a valid way to get feedback from the Team as a means to report to the CEO under the circumstances of facing risks that could risk feasibility of the MVP?  Is there a better and more agile-friendly way to get feedback from the Team? How would you facilitate such a decision?  "
713,How can a team working on research based items work in an Agile project?,"My R&amp;D organization is following an Agile (Scrum) development methodology. One of the development teams is working mostly on items that are really problematic in terms of the certainty during the sprint planning. It means they mostly deal with performance issues that need to be researched and resolved.  This team is expected to work in collaboration with the other teams, while following the Agile methodology. The manager of the team finds it hard since during sprint planning there is very low certainty around his team's tasks. Moreover, during the sprint, hot issues arise and require the team's prompt response.  What would be a proper way for this team to work in this context? How should they plan their work? Should they allocate buckets of time for the unexpected issues? Should they split their work to research and resolution parts and plan for them separately? Any other ideas? "
714,Ideas for setting up task/project management for small team..,"Currently I work on a small team of 3 developers in a privately owned college with about 12,000 students.  There is currently no tracking of projects, tasks, bugs, or other work items.  After I started here and realized that they don't have any sort of task tracking I was appalled.  Recently I have been given the go ahead to come up with a solution to this problem.  Because it is a small team I want to keep it basic but the team supports around 20 different applications and systems.  I have access to MS Project and TFS but have no training or experience using either system.  We have just started to use TFS as our version control software.    What would you recommend as a starting point?  Should I delve into MS Project/TFS and try work my way through that or should I look at something more basic and easier to use?  Prior to this I have used software like Mantis, Scrumworks, and Excel to track issues.  I have a good idea of what is needed to begin to organize things but am not sure which tool to use. "
715,Is Iteration Strength a valuable parameter for you?,"We all know how to use Iteration Velocity parameter. However, there are situations during an iteration that one takes an unexpected day off, or there is a bank holiday, or there is another reason for one not to work.  In such situations, you can use Iteration Strength which is kind of a ""normalised velocity"" that takes into account actual man-days during iteration.  Do you use Iteration Strength in your projects? Is it valuable information for you?  The idea behind the question is that I've heard two opinions:   ""I don't care about the strength, it will all be visible in the velocity after a few iterations"" ""yes, it is the actual team performance""   and I wonder how you feel about it. "
716,Can organizational trainings (Classroom and Web-based) be considered for Continuing Certification Requirements (CCR) of PMP?,"Can organizational trainings on Project Management (Classroom and Web-based) be considered for Continuing Certification Requirements (CCR) of PMP?  For example I recently attended a few trainings on Leadership (classroom training), Agile Methods (classroom training), Organization specific Processes for Project Management  (classroom training), Estimation techniques (web-based training).  Can I report these as PDU's for PMI’s CCR? If yes, should these be reported under ""Course or Training"" or ""Informal Learning""  Note: I read through the CCR handbook at [website]"
717,"In Scrum, should we be billed for defects and unplanned activities?","My company is the client. An offshore company is developing our product. We pay them on a monthly basis. They send us an invoice with a  fixed rate per full time resource. They also send us a breakdown of all tasks done by each resource.   Should we be paying for non-planned things that are neither a part of our requirements nor are a change request from our side (i.e. deployment to staging server not working, updating codebase to support newest iOS version, etc.)? After user acceptance testing, should we be paying for the development team to fix defects we find in features they delivered as complete?   Please note our contract doesn't say anything about handling these issues. "
718,How will handle the user story as part of change request ?,"We have implemented a feature as per the discussion with product manager. But there is a requirement change from the customer. So how will handle this request ?  For example : I have created a user story to build a new report - performance report and list in the reports module. However, the customer wants to move and list in different location - say performance reports. So the requirement is to move the performance reports from reports module to performance reports.  Do we have to create separate user story for this change? What are the additional steps to be captured when creating user stories ? "
719,Tracking points spent on bugs during sprint,"The product owner wants to keep track on how much points are spent on bugs during a sprint. This can raise some issues, such as:   Scoring a task that is already done. Surprisingly even with it done, there are sometimes discussion and divergences. Scoring many small tasks with 0 points that at the end actually sum up to something meaningful (a bunch of fast fixes). Counting points spent on bugs as available points for new features in the next sprint, alongside with new bugs that eventually will show up.   I agree with him that it is important to track the time spent on it, but points doesn't seems to play really well in this case. So what are the best approaches and practices in this case? Count the hours spent on each one? "
720,How to make better software developers out of less-than-average ones?,"I've asked this before in other places, and I'm now turning to you guys to see what sort of advice you can offer.  Some background: I'm a project manager at an offshore company. I’m in no way the best that’s out there. Most important (or so I believe) is that I am just as good as my team is. I've been at it for the last 3 years.  I don't get to choose the people I work with (can't hire or fire people). We are using all sorts of methodologies (agile, scrum, waterfall, RUP, you-name-it). We are holding both weekly and milestone meetings in which we are trying to learn what went wrong/right. So,this is not a question of motivation (my employer is paying them more than fair, they get full employment benefits, etc ), nor one of simply teaching them new skills. This is more about addressing a problem within the mind-set of the average developer.  I've worked with a lot of people both good and bad during the years. There were a few of them exceptional, but most of them were less-than average. Most of the times I'm usually confronted with guys that are getting stuck way to often, guys that are skipping solutions as they are not careful enough to see past their own coding mistakes and guys that are simply drifting away from the tasks to wherever their day-dream takes them.  I was wondering if (and how) can they be determined to properly pay attention to their work, to be able to determine solutions and to unstuck themselves without me having to check on their work 24/7.  I would really love to worry myself that I'm intervening in their work too much, that I'm always giving them the solution without letting them think. But at this point, I can't see this happening  Some ways I've been suggested to try so far are:   Make them read “Addison Wesley – Pragmatic Programmer” and ""Clean Code: A Handbook of Agile Software Craftsmanship"" – hold periodic meetings for each chapter and discuss what they have learned so far. Hold some sort of ""Quick&amp;Great Code of the Week competition"", using a new/unknown language for implementation – given that this would be a new language for everyone, this should give me/us an idea over who is missing what. Get the rest of the management team to analyze ""a great TED talk about motivation by Dan Pink"" and see if we find anything that works for further motivating them.   So, I'm now wondering: is there anything else? would this approach work?   I'm also worried that even though I'll eventually set them on the right track, once the current project closes and the development team gets reassigned, they'll revert back to their old habits. How can I make the knowledge ""stick"" and prevent this from happening? "
721,Counting PMP experience part time on multiple projects,"I know you aren't allowed to claim hours for overlapping dates when you work full time because there are only 40 hours in a week. I wonder though how to document my situation. I usually have one big project and one small project going on at the same time. I spend 60% of my time on the big project and 40% on the small one, like this:   Project A: 1/1/15 to 3/30/15, 60% of my time. Total possible hours = 503 * 60% = 302 qualifying hours. Project B: 2/1/15 to 2/28/15, 40% of my time. Total possible hours = 154 * 40% = 62 qualifying hours. Project C: 3/1/15 to 3/30/15, 40% of my time. Total possible hours = 166 * 40% = 66 qualifying hours.   In this case, should I report 503 hours for Project A and none for the others? 302 + 62 + 66 for all three projects? Or only 302 for A and none for B and C?  "
722,ScrumBut. Does this term have any negative connotations?,"I have always heard this word in a negative context. But I don't understand why? I don't see anything bad in deviating from the Scrum. Why not, if it works? Well used ScrumBan is ScrumBut too. Or even if this deviation is not very good, but dictated by unavoidable external factors (such as company policy, or the terms of a contract already signed), why not take benefits from other aspects of Scrum that can be implemented?  Maybe there is not any negotive connotation for this term and the word acquired a negative color only inside my quite wide, but still the local community (In the Russian language translation of ScrumBut ""СкрамНо"" sounds very similar to the Russian translation of the English ""s-word"". But on the other hand sametimes I have seen ScrumBut with an additional ""t"" on the end, which reinforces the negative connotation too).  So, I have two questions:   Does this term have any negative connotation? If it has, why? If it is (yet) impossible to follow all the prescription of Scrum, maybe it would be better to use ScrumBut and have part of Scrum benefits, rather than none?     P.S. If this is the correct definition of ScrumBut (ScrumButs and Modifying Scrum) then I didn't see anything wrong with this. "
723,Evidences and experience letter for PMP,"I am working in one of the very big petrochemical project from IT construction to startup.   I'm still working there. I have been working in the operations department, not exactly in project department, and not as a project manager or a leader, but the fact is that I covered a lot of project activities.  Can I apply for PMP, and do I need any evidence of my abilities from  my present employer or manager?  If I require it, can anyone give me the format for the experience letter which I need to take from my present employer, which will be acceptable by PMP(PMI)? "
724,Stories for new team members?,"How are new team members in a Scrum team most appropriately handled?  If they can't directly work on customer driven stories, how are they involved in Scrum's story-centric process? Are they assigned stories?   "
725,Tasks of a PM in a Software project?,"Can someone try to explain me the tasks of a PM in a software project? Especially during the stages of development, test and release.   Can't figure out what benefit they bring to the team during those stages I know they plan, monitor, delegate, analyse risks, costs, time etc. but what is the PM doing during the stages I mentioned above?  "
726,How shall developers clarify PBI during its implementation?,"Should developers have direct communication with stakeholders during Product Backlog Items implementation for their clarification. Or should all communication go through Product Owner?  On the Scrum Guide we can read the following:  On the one hand the Product Owner should:     The Product Owner is the sole person responsible for managing the   Product Backlog. Product Backlog management includes:         Clearly expressing Product Backlog items;   ...      But on the other hand:     The Product Owner may do the above work, or have the Development Team   do it. However, the Product Owner remains accountable.   So, theoretically the Development Team may communicate with stakeholders for the clarification of the PBI.  But is this a good practice? I always think, that the Product Owner is the single entry point for all requirements.  I see 4 options in this situation:   Developers may clarify PBIs with stakeholders during implementation. But in that case we have a risk, that the stakeholders view on this PBI may be different than the Product Owner's view (for example, the stakeholder may want to make the scope bigger or thay may have a different view on the aPBI even among themselves). The Product Owner may lose control of the PBIs scope. Developers may clarify PBI's only with the Product Owner. This is the way I always work. But in one case I know of, the Product Owner physically doesn't  have time enough to do all this work. What shall we do in this case? Ask the developers to take more initiative and to resolve all issues at their sole discretion. Force to define PBI very well before taking it in Sprint, and after it is taken, forbid the developers to ask any question about it (it's not a joke, it's the real situation. I read about it in this article. Unfortunately, it's only in Russian, so just believe me, that described situation is the real case).   So, how shall developers clarify PBI during its implementation? Maybe exist better solution, than described above?    Important note: I'm talking about PBIs, that are already in Sprint, and that need additional clarification during work. "
727,Does the current PMP exam ask about human motivational theory?,"I have already completed my class for the 35 hours of coursework, and am working through my second full read through the PMBOK 5th edition.  I have also been looking online for test prep exams and find that many of them are claiming to be PMBOK 5th edition questions, but many of the questions contain Maslov's hierarchy of needs, etc. However none of this is covered in the 5th edition of the PMBOK from what I can find.    Does the current exam actually contain these items? Hopefully the answer is from someone who tested in the past few months. If so how much time should I focus on them? Were these questions from previous versions of the PMBOK that are somehow still in these test exams? I would assume the answer to #1 will answer this.  "
728,Test only stories in the Sprint?,"We realized that we have an urgent requirement to complete a series of automated testing stories in a sprint. Therefore we took in automation only stories. Some manual testers took in a few other urgent stories, therefore in the Doing column we have a bunch of stories waiting to be tested.   Obviously this will continue going forward because there will be a backlog of stories to be tested, whereas development will continue (we can't halt development because of this).  Any suggestions to get around this issue? Throw in more testers? Btw, our developers (and management) don't think that developers are good testers because they don't have the tester's eye, so they're more likely to make mistakes in their testing. "
729,How to draw stacked column chart with custom text fields?,"I am working on a report on MS Project 2013. In this report there is chart.  The chart is based :   NumberOftasks (Y-axis) which is a custom field of type number. Localization (X-axis) which is done by Grouping the tasks by localization (it is a custom text field).    The awkward situation is that I have a custom field  of type text, called typeOftask which take two values : either A or B.   I would like to draw clustered column chart that take in consideration the typeOfTask so that the column is divided into two values : the number of tasks of type A and the number of tasks of type B.   Something like this :    Please, how to do that in MS Project 2013 ? I know it is possible ? "
730,How do you implement ideas from Peopleware in an early startup?,"Peopleware suggests that managers should set realistic schedules and should not put overreaching pressures on developers. In an early startup with hired developers, how does one keep the competitive edge with a very fast paced culture without burning out the developers? I've heard stories that people at startups work tirelessly without breaks, but won't that cause burnout eventually? How does one strike the right balance? "
731,Should a burndown chart be based on stories or tasks completed?,"TL;DR; As the title reads: do you base your burndown chart on stories completed, or on tasks completed?   Some background on why I'm asking this: I currently work in a software development team of 4 developers, doing sprints that last 2 weeks. In those two weeks we generally get around 50 to 70 storypoints worth of stories to 'Done'. We regularly have stories that make up 50% or more of those points, say 25 to 40 points. Measuring stories versus tasks leads to the following situations:  Stories: The large stories will be 'doing'/'checked out'/'in progress' for a long time. The burndown will flatline, then when the story gets finished it plummets due to the large number of story points burned. This gives a jagged chart, making it look like suddenly a lot has been done. Also, the flatlining chart doesn't boost the ""we're getting stuff done!"" morale. Lastly, external stakeholders / other teams may frown at the burndown stalling (minor point, I could care less as long as we deliver in the end).  Tasks: Burning down tasks within stories will give a better impression of the work being done. It will give a smoother line and probably boost morale. My main objective is: it's not displaying actual work done. Work is by default only usable when the full story is 'DONE'. It's great that we've completed a task for the story, but even that last tiny unfinished other task can block the story from being finished and making the sprint.  My gut feeling leans towards burning down stories, mostly due to the fact that tasks can paint a misleadingly happy picture that won't come true at the end of the sprint. I'd rather be skeptic and pleasantly surprised when it turns out for the better. What does your team do? "
732,How to Organise Help Desk?,"I have to organize the help desk. I have some thoughts and ideas. The project for which I have to do is a Web application. It has 5 servers in different time zones. We have something about 25 instances of our Web application and 8 entry points. The help desk is going to be split into different levels.   Key users - Normal users can report issues only to key users. Only key users can proceed issue to help desk.  Help desk - people with handbooks and defined ""know how"" workarounds and other solutions. They should also be able to get full knowledge about the issue from our users. Support team - They should resolve some simple code bugs and configuration bugs. The last part is development team. If some issue needs new feature development or it's a huge bug then this team should schedule it and resolve the problem.   I've got some concerns about 3rd point and the support team. What is the border between simple bug which should be left for support team, and which should be proceeded to development team? What do you think? For example if something will take 1 day/person it stays in support team otherwise it goes to development team? (If the task is longer).  And the second question: Who should be responsible for prioritizing tasks for support team? This is something what I don't know what to think of. :( Is the same Manager should/can be responsible for daily prioritization of support team tasks and development team tasks? "
733,Team productivity vs team size,"I am looking for information about how the team size impacts project velocity. Let's assume that I have a small project estimated at 300 hours for single worker. What impact does team size have on estimation? Is there any publications/book describing this relationship?  I mean something like this:   1 person team - 300 h 2 person team - 300 h + n% 3 person team - 300 h + m%   During my work, I've noticed that project velocity depends on team size. I want to know the scale factor in order to better estimate projects. "
734,Methodology for Deciding Between Building on Existing Code or Starting New,"This is a question about assessing the cost/benefit or ROI of a prospective project.  I'm working in 6-8 old years software project. It has a lot of issues and also failures plus some failed people on its way. Right now after raising the project (software application) from the dead, when the new requirement comes, the developers are looking in the code (not in the working features in terms of usage) the corresponding code. There are ideas of creating, rewriting the project from the beginning. I wonder if there is a sense from your point of view to look in the old code something that corresponds the new requirement for the current application? Because if it is different, then the developers are getting back to the requester, describing what they found in the code, and once again discuss requirement.  In one side it fosters requirements engineering and requirements gathering process, on the other hand it may be waste or unnecessary extension of the time. Because it may be better and faster start from scratch with the new code for the new feature. And especially if the new system or rewriting the system can be the case.  While there may be opinions on this subject, it would be helpful to find a methodology so I could recommend whether the stakeholders are better off continuing to invest in the old code or build from scratch? "
735,Can you add a person to watch a JIRA issue?,"In some cases, I'd like to let a teammate watch an issue, and be informed of whatever is going on about that issue, even though the issue is not assigned to him/her.  Is it possible to add a person to watch an exising issue, without assigning the task to him/her?  How? "
736,Can contracts based on agile project deliverables be tied to staged payments?,"Do software developers operating under some sort of agile development cycle and presenting a series of 'deliverables' to their customer expect&mdash;or contract&mdash;their clients to make a stage payment per acceptable deliverable?  I ask as many systems take months to produce, test, and implement at the client's HQ and the developers have continual outgoings on salaries, rent, sub-contractee payments, etc. It's hard to see a bank holding their nerve for long without cash flow. House builders demand stage payments. Machinery builders demand deposit up front against materials. So why not software developers? "
737,how to integrate millennials into an existing working environment without firing them and keeping the old employees as well?,"My question is related to groups, motivation and millennials - aka generation y. I had a colleague who was a real millennial: he was really driven, he was always looking for new challenges, and was unable to sit tight for an hour. He was a good guy, but once a month he wanted to quit, because the job wasn't challenging enough for him. My boss managed to find something for him every time, so it seemed that the problem has been solved. However, the moral of the other team members (mostly generation x) started to decrease, because he did all the good stuff, and they started think about quitting. Unfortunately, we couldn't fire him, because he did the job well, we couldn't afford to lose a colleague and it was really hard to find new employees.  I've started to think that our approach wasn't good enough, because we tried to motivate on a personal level, but we should have worked on the team level instead. All the resources I managed to read focused on the employee not on the team, but I don't see how to have a working team when it consists of generation x and y employees.  This situation might not be that urgent, but the millennials will start to work, and they'll work with generation x, so their ""integration"" needs to be solved soon, and I've read somewhere that the generation z has appeared on the horizon.  Finally, the questions:   Is there a good example, or rule of thumb how to integrate millennials into an existing working environment without firing them and keeping the old employees? Is there such thing as motivation on the team level? If so, how can it be aligned with the personal level?  "
738,How (and in what units) to measure the product scope?,"Short version:  How and in which units is it better to measure the product scope (volume of incoming requirements / amount of business functionality) if different parts of product (different requirements / different parts of business functionality) have a different nature?  Long version:  In our company, we want to develop and implement a methodology for measuring the scope of the product.  We want to reach the following goals:   To make business requirements measurable and thereby more transparent. I.e. we want to measure all incoming requests for product improvement in some units. These units should not be related with real man-days because we don’t know who exactly will implement these requirements. Furthermore, these units should not be related with ideal man-days because ideal man-days are for the work scope, not for the product scope. For example, we can implement the same requirement in three different ways: we may implement it fast with bad quality of code, slow with good quality of code and extremely slow with parallel refactoring. It’s depends on us, how we will do this item, but we want be honest with our internal customers (another departments of our company) and show the same «price» for all equal requirements (regardless of how we will do it). Calculate productivity of the team. As noted above, the work scope is not equal to the product scope. Productivity in our understanding is the amount of the product scope units that we did within a fixed amount of time (that’s iteration). I.e. the team may do a lot of useful work (to reduce technical debt, for example), but if they don’t implement enough requirements, productivity will be low.   To achieve these goals, we need to choose a unit for the product scope and learn how to measure it.  Story points are good candidates for these kind of units, but we have a problem with them: we have a lot of different technical systems within our product. So, there are many different kinds of requirements: make additional automatization for engineers, create new reports to managers, implement new functionality to end users, etc. Furthermore, one requirement may be related with several technical systems. Managers can’t compare such incompatible requirements just as developers can’t compare tasks for different technical systems (to implement such incompatible requirements). It’s like comparing red and hot. I tried to solve a similar problem here: How to use Story Points, if User Stories are completely different?.  At the current moment, we do the following: we have created a table for the different types of requirements, defined the reference stories (the reference requirements) to each of these types, and estimate other requirements based on these reference stories. There are two (three) big disadvantages in this solution:   We have chosen reference stories such that, their implementation took roughly the same amount of time. So, this is a fundamental problem: we have a relationship between reference stories and man-days at the moment when we defined them (we wanted to avoid this situation, see above). As far as we will make changes within technical systems, story points of a different kind will drift apart. In some systems technical debt will increase and related story points will be more «expensive». In others systems technical debt will be decreased and related story points will be «cheaper». As a result, after some time one story point related with different requirements will have a different cost. In that case we will not achieve our first goal. If we periodically normalize story points, by choosing the new basic story of each type, that will have the same man-days estimates, then we will not be able to see any change of the team's performance over time. So we will not achieve our second goal.   Also, I heard about a function point but I didn’t look in this direction. It seems a little complicated. Should I look at it more deeply?  Maybe there is another way to solve my problems?    Update after receivied answers (19.12.16)   I meant a volume of business requirements, not a value of it.   I will try to give an example:   Imagine, we are refurbishing an apartment. We have two requirements:   To hang a picture; To install a chin-up bar for pull-ups.   Volume of requirements (i.e. product scope):   To hang a picture: 1 point, because it is necessary to drill one hole.  To install a chin-up bar for pull-ups: 4 points, bacause it is necessary to drill 4 holes.    Volume of work to implement requirements (i.e. work scope):   To hang a picture: 1 point, because to make a hole in dry wall is very easy.  To install a chin-up bar for pull-ups: 16 points, because a chin-up bar for pull-ups should be installed with wide bolts on load–bearing wall which is usually is made of concrete and I have a low power drill. Accordingly, I know that to make a hole with my low power drill on a load–bearing wall is roughly four times harder than making a hole in dry wall.    Ideally, the volume of requirements should be close to the volume of work to implement the requirements. For example, if I were to buy a good drill, it will be no difference, which material the wall is made of.   The question is, what units and how to measure the volume (not the value) functional requirements, regardless of exactly how we will implement them and how much time we need for this. "

740,How can I improve my product manager skills in a senior-developer environment?,"I´m working as a product manager in a young startup. I'm really junior as I am currently in a working semester, pausing my studies (business major). In my role, I am managing the development of our platform, our team consists of a senior CTO, one Full Stack Dev on site and a team of 2 Senior and 2 Junior Devs that work remotely.  My work looks pretty much like this: I decide, together with the CEO, on the features of the product, then create, together with the CTO, the User story backlog and split it up in sprints. For every story, I make sure that there is a detailed feature spec as a single source of truth for the development team.   Coming to my problem: I feel like I'm super dependent on the input of our CTO, who is really experienced in managing projects in big scale. How can I take back a bit more control over the situation? I'm familiar with a lot of aspects of the scrum method, but I don´t really know how to implement proper testing, for example. Should I do the testing, or should we develop automated testing? How does a testing spec look like?  Yeah, so pretty general problems that I'm facing - it would be great to get some feedback/input! "
741,Can you change the end date of a sprint?,Ideally we commit to work being completed and releasable by the time the sprint finishes. However sometimes things happen or estimating is a little bit out.  If we are approaching the end date of a sprint and a user story is not quite finished - maybe another day will see it completed - is it ok to change the end date e.g make the sprint 11 working days instead of 10?  Or should we strictly abide by the end date and move the unfinished story into the next sprint?  Or something else? 
742,"What is the generally-accepted definition of a ""software project?""","One of side discussions here on PMSE brought me to this: what exactly do we understand when we say ""a project?""  The most obvious thing is to start with Wikipedia definition:      A project is a temporary endeavor,   having a defined beginning and end   (usually constrained by date, but can   be by funding or deliverables),   undertaken to meet unique goals and   objectives, usually to bring about   beneficial change or added value.   However this brings me to another problem: using this definition in orthodox way would make many ventures, well, non-projects. Consider Google search as an example - its development isn't constrained by date or funding or specific deliverables, yet my guess is no one would deny it is a project.  Also, many R&amp;D projects don't suit the definition well. Same with many startup projects which change rapidly along with their constraints.  Then, even if we think about ""classic"" software projects, when exactly do they end? I mean there's maintenance and operations and such and you can treat it as a part of a project or not. If the former is true we come back to constraint problem - how long is the venture going to last?  So what would be a common definition of a software project?  Note: I didn't try to make the question cross-industrial as that would be even more difficult to define, so let's stick with software. "
743,How to view resource allocation to specific projects,"In MS Project, I've created a resource pool which is shared amongst several projects, can I see how much time a certain resource is allocated to a certain project?

745,A development workflow for a team of 3 developers that minimizes outside interruptions?,"My question is similar to these two topics;   A software development workflow for a company of 2-4 developers? How to manage a Web Project   but where my team fails is when we are all working on separate projects and we get bombarded with input from many other departments.  I'm sure Scrum and Agile are similar in that, once the project is started after its defined, there should be very little if not no input or changes to the plan. This tends to fail every time no matter the size of the project. We do have the support of the company and product owner but some of these problems originate from that very same person.  How can we minimize these outside interruptions to the project? "
746,Assigning responsibility with physical Kanban Board,"Question  When starting a team new to using kanban boards (in this case a physical board) how do you assign tasks to them and get them in the habit of checking the board for new responsibilities?   Team Background  Edit: The team is a few experienced engineers/techs and a handful inexperienced techs.  Tasks come sporadically but have a typical flow. For example, one engineer may be assigned to research a COTS product, then the manager would take care of making sure it finally gets purchased and delivered. We'd plan on having a few main lanes, something like ""propose"", ""research"", ""approve/reject"", ""done"".  My Idea   Start a sticky note and assign a users name to it for the first few weeks email the person responsible and mention 'check the board for status!' Have a temporary lane labeled 'emailed responsible user' to denote the task has been assigned via email. this would get deleted as people got used to the board   My concerns with this idea   People may become reliant on the email and forget the board Deleting a 'temporary lane' disrupts the momentum gained over those weeks The original assumption ""people won't jump on the board idea"" could be wrong and everyone is looking at the board Assume people will look at the board and use a less formal verbal discussion ""hey Bob did you research that one issue with the PC? I threw it up on the board 2 days ago and sent you an email with the details""   Ideas from Other SO Questions  this question and this question address how to visually show who's responsible but not how to tell that person they are responsible for the task (again assuming people won't be in the habit of browsing the board)     For each team-member, use a magnet with it's name on it and put the magnet on the sticky (the task).   and     A yellow note represents a project and an avatar shows who or which team is working on that project  "
747,How to make identical changes to multiple sub project files,"I am about to create a master plan that will contain over 200 small sub project files.  Each sub project file will have common elements such as standard Custom fields.  I have created a template for the sub projects and will now replicate it for each of the 200+ projects and them distribute them to the relevant Project Managers.  My worry is that after creating these 200+ project files I will realise I need to make an identical change to all of them.  EG Add a new custom field to each file, or modify a drop down list in each file, or add a new filter to each file.  Is there a way, presumably using VBA, that will allow me to apply the change to all the sub project files via one instruction?  EG if I want to show custom field Date1 (renamed to TargetDate) in each sub project file, what is the best way to do this other than modifying each file manually one after the other?  Thanks  Eric "
748,Team Management by Metrics,"Metrics are valuable tools to measure performance and to manage projects/people. Nevertheless, I have started to encounter certain issues with regards to the measurement of my team's performance.  Members of the team have started to believe that ""more is better"", and they are trying to get involved in additional assignments. I was pleasantly surprised with this turn of events; the team is motivated and want more challenges to keep developing their skills and grow a reputation within the Company. Therefore, even though the tasks weren't fully completed successfully, the contribution was appreciated and noted as part of their development plans.   However, following up on several 1:1 reviews with certain members of the team, I realized that the real intention behind this was the number of assignments on which they have participated rather than the quality of their performance, using these metrics to request a salary increase.  How can I implement mechanisms to measure and balance Quality over Quantity on my Team's Performance Metrics?  How can we motivate people to increase their level of involvement in the projects taking into account the quality expectations? "
749,I need practical tools or workshop tips to create product vision for an existing product,"I am familiar with the product vision but never used it so far since I joined once it was already done  I have been appointed to a project where 2 existing products are overlapping and we need to set up an agile project to understand if is better to merge the products or seek and develop whatever other solution is better. I will be scrum master in this project and I have been asked to set up a sprint zero starting with a workshop for the stakeholders to create a product vision and product backlog.  Does anyone have any practical suggestion how to structure a workshop to do that work? stakeholders are mainly managers, is it correct that they come up with the content of the product vision in the workshop?

750,"Why the Auto-scheduled Finish date is Wrong in this case , using MS Project 2013 ?","When I set a Auto scheduled task to Start date : 07/05/2015 , and Duration to 12 month.

752,Story Points mean effort but not time?,"In Scrum, team assigns story points to tasks during planning poker. When explaining the meaning of points, the scrum master says it is effort. So if it is time consuming task but can be done easily or it is a complex task but can be done fast they all can have the same points. So the intention is to forget about the time units and play with effort units. But in my opinion it is not fair. Why? Let me say how many concepts connected with points play as time.    After several sprints team already know how many points it can complete during one sprint. Sprint duration is fixed - say two weeks. Hence if you find your velocity say 200 points per 2 weeks then you know that the team speed is 20 points per day. Which generally means that one task which has 20 points should be done, ideally, in one day. Hence 20 points means one day. And one day, is, surprisingly, time unit not effort. If you asses by effort then you might finish it in 2 hours and you will be ahead of your sprint which is not good (wrong estimation). Burn down charts connect points to time as well. So as in the previous case, we again can think about points as time. Otherwise, we will get ahead or behind of the sprint schedule. Team very soon identifies with time units, probably because of 2 previous reasons.   So why we say points are based on effort and are not connected directly to time if, indeed, they are meaning time? What is a problem to say X points is Y time for team A and Z time for team B? "
753,ConsolidateProjects Method: how can I import Sub Project Summary task Custom field contents?,"If possible I want to avoid using Resource Pools and embedded project files as I have had problems with these in a Sharepoint environment, so I am exploring using the ConsolidateProjects Method to create a schedule that consolidates all my sub projects.  Using this code  Application.ConsolidateProjects Filenames:=strFiles, AttachToSources:=False, NewWindow:=True   I can populate my project file with the data from all the sub project files that reside in the nominated folder.  The only problem is that it does not import the contents of custom fields that relate to the sub project SUMMARY task.  It DOES import the value from the standard Priority field, but does NOT import the value in the Custom field Text1.  It works fine (and very quickly) for sub project tasks (and their summary tasks) but not for the sub project Summary task.  How can I import the contents of custom fields that relate to the sub project Summary task?  Will I need to open each file individually and extract it somehow?  That will really slow the process down.  Thanks  Eric  "
754,Software project workflow template for the lonely programmer?,"My problem is simple: I am the only software developer in an organization trying to start organizing projects for me. Management directors don't care and ignore EVERYTHING about corporate governance or project management. I only present some documentation to cover my back but I know they don't read anything I've sent.  I want to have a template for my project, a simple workflow to follow for small software projects.  I've read some books which talks about: ""Calculating the communication channels"", ""Calculating the critical paths"", ""Cost estimating"", ""Quality policies"", etc. and I have nothing against these good practices, but I'm alone and I have to minimize my time investment, specially when I have people asking for immediate results.  Is there some simple project management steps or workflow (must-have) for lonely developers? (I don't need a software, just a generic template).  For example: Computer Repair with Diagnostic Flowcharts is a book which contains workflows for typical simple problems with computers. Is there something like that for PM and specifically for my scenario? "
755,How involved should a PM be in ensuring payments for completed milestones?,"In a project where payments are due according to a set schedule, what is the role of a PM in ensuring these obligations are met?  Example of a payment schedule within an agreement: 50% deposit, 25% upon completion of analysis and 25% upon completion of development.  Typically, my preference is to stay out of this and delegate it to Accounts Receivable. However, since this is a prerequisite to starting the next phase of a project, I feel that my involvement is required as these should be communicated to a client clearly. So if a project is stalled for this reason, they are fully aware of the cause for the delay.  The question is to what extent should a PM be involved and how should these kinds of contractual requirements be communicated to a client?   I searched around for external sources that discuss this and found this link: [website]Refer to point # 4:      Collecting. Firms need cash to operate, not completed projects. As PM, you have the closest relationship to the client, and are in the ideal position to “assist” the client in the payment process. The best expression of confidence in the quality of one’s work is to insist on prompt payment for it.  "
756,The role of a product team in new product development,"This question is specific to new product development.   I am part of a medium size organization.  In our organization, our executive team sets the product strategy.  Once the product strategy is set, a product manager is assigned to work with a cross-functional, cross-departmental team.  Together, the PM and these department managers or assistant managers become the ""product team.""    I've advocated that the product teams should be treated like a board of directors or an advisory committee.  The product manager should drive what needs to be driven with the individual that it's relevant to.  So, each department is like a spoke, the PM is like the hub, and the product team is like the outside of the wheel where everything is shared for clarity.  In the weekly or every two week product team meetings, a typical meeting would look like, ""I'm working with John in Sales to develop a sales strategy.  This is what we're looking at now; we continue to refine.  Do you have any feedback?  This week I'm going to work with Bob in legal and Susan in accounting to make sure our agreements are buttoned up.  Could you recommend the best way to accomplish this?  Am I doing the right thing?  Do you think there needs to be any course correction?  etc""  I realize that those are a bunch of ""i"" sentences.  Ultimately, I believe the product manager should maintain control of the timeline and maintain responsibility for the success of the project.  The opposing camp's view would treat the product team like a committee where all major decision making is done by consensus (while minor decisions are left to the departmental representative): ""What have we all done this week?""  John from Sales would say, ""I've worked on a sales strategy, but I forgot to print it out...""  Bob in legal would have actually done his work.  Susan in accounting would say, ""I'm not sure I understand.""  Tom in operations would say, ""Have we thought about how we are going to provide customer support once we've launched this product?""  To which the account managers say, ""You know, you're right?  Why don't we wait on [doing anything that we can actually do now] and talk about that more.  Let's set that as the agenda item for next week.""   The power dynamics would have sidelined the PM's ability to say, ""No, we need to focus on this now.  While the support issue is important, it's not important right now.""   I also understand that if you are going to work in a committee like this, the ""forming"" stage of the team is important to define how to deal with situations like that and agreeing on how you're going to approach your work, a timeline.   My questions for the community are:   Who is involved in the new product development process in your organizations?  Are product teams typical, or is it normally in the hands of the product department to work one on one with each of the departments (to be the hub of the spoke)? If you have product teams, how does the decision making dynamic play out?  What are the relative roles of each of the people involved? Do you have any advice for the situation I laid out above?    "
757,What's the difference between a Team Lead and a Team Manager?,"Full disclosure: I am not a project manager. However, no other group on stack exchange seemed more likely to be able to comment constructively.  In the company where I am about to begin work, each development team has an architect/team lead and a Team Manager. I am taking on the Team Manager role, though it currently seems a little poorly defined.   My question is: how do the responsibilities of these two roles differ? I expect that they may overlap in some places. I have been told I am responsible for everything. Meaning, the architect has to convince me before he can proceed. But who is supposed to do what on a daily basis? How do I manage and lead the team without usurping the Team Lead's job?  (I should add that there is also a ScrumMaster assigned to the team.) "
758,How to Import Resource Availability from Excel when it varies by month,"I have a number of generic resources, eg Engineers, where each individual is treated as interchangeable with all the other Engineers.  I want to show their availability as for instance 100% in October (equating to 1 engineer) and 200% in November (ie 2 engineers).  I know how to do this manually in Project via the Resource Information dialog, but I want to import this data from a table in Excel where these values are calculated.  Using this table as an example  Name     Max_Units  Available_From  Available_To Engineer     100    01/10/2018      31/10/2018 Engineer     200    01/11/2018   If I import this data I was hoping to see one Engineer resource in the Resource Sheet with 2 entries in the Resource Information dialog under Resource Availabioity.  Instead I get 2 resources called Engineer in the Resource Sheet.  If I double click on the first entry (the one with 100 units) to see the Resource Information dialog I see the data for the first line in the above table.  But if I look at the second entry (the one with 200 units) I see this.  Note it shows the wrong dates for Availability.    What I want is 1 resource in the Resource Sheet called Engineer but with his Availability in the Resource Information dialog showing as 100 in October and 200 from 1 November onwards.  I know this can be done manually, but how can I import the data to achieve this result?  Do I need VBA code?  If so any suggestions are welcome.  Thanks  Eric "

760,In scrum should incomplete stories be re-estimated or does the original estimate get burned down when it's finally completed?,"If I have a story that's been estimated at 10 story points and we don't manage to complete it in a sprint how do you handle estimates for the sprint in which it's next included (assuming it gets selected for development)? Assuming 80% of development was completed on the story should it be re-estimated at (for argument's sake) 2 story points? Or should the original estimate remain and all 10 story points be burned down when it's finally completed? The former approach seems wrong because a 'big' task now looks like it's small. The latter seems wrong because it surely mis-represents actual velocity in a sprint.  If I write a new story for the remaining work then that also seems like a mis-representation because the original 80% of the work is unaccounted for unless I re-estimate it at 0 points and include it along with the new story for the remaining work and resolve it at the same time as the new 2 story point story is completed.     Footnote      For those who are interested in the background to this question it's born out of JIRA's default agile board behaviour, which is to return incomplete stories to the top of the backlog. In general we've been re-writing them and/or splitting them into new stories before putting a new estimate against them but I was never sure if this was really the ""correct"" way of doing it.  "

762,How to check for soft skills during recruitement?,"Background Info  In the past year or so we have been scaling in team size and I am responsible together with our CTO for recruiting candidates of all types of technical background (Frontend, backend, operations, QA). I have not that much experience myself in doing the interviews (up till now I interviewed 20+ candidates).  We have some headhunters or recruitment offices help us with supplying candidates. I drill during the interviews into the soft skills, Cognitive ability and so on. The CTO drills deeper for the technical evaluation.  My focus point  I must say we do a quite well job in evaluating the candidates their technical skills. But technical skills is just, let's say 50-60% that makes a candidate a good candidate.  The other part is the soft skills and Cognitive ability like :   Can the candidate learn new stuff easily ? Does the candidate stick to what (s)he knows or tries to find for new solutions or technologies? Can the candidate explain himself in clear language? Is the candidate structured or messy? How pro active is the candidate? How well is a team member a team player? How much can the candidate think outside the box ? How well can a candidate see the big picture ? How active does the canidate see issues and tries to fix them (technically, about development process, ...) Etc ...   I do understand it is impossible to have always a straight forward answer to all of these questions, and its a science itself to profile a candidate. I presume there is no utopia like that. So I am not asking for the impossible, but, at least the advice or experience of you guys. I have heard often, recruiting and interviewing is a skills that you improve by exercise, which is fine, but help is always useful. But rest assure, I understand this is no exact science ;)  My Question  How do you try to profile these soft skills and Cognitive abilities from technical candidates in an software development environment that you need to recruit for your team? Do you have any particular strategies or approaches that have been proven useful for yourself ? Please do share if you have any good question or approach.  I have been reading for example ""How google works"", it has a nice chapter on recruiting, but there isn't much other material that I found up till now. Most sources help the person on the other side of the table, the interviewee.  Note to the community  If this question is too open for a Q&amp;A like this or not specific enough for Project Management space please let me know and I'll withdraw the this question. "
763,Very Interesting ways to encourage responsible behavior in a project.,"What are the funny and innovative techniques you use as a manager to bring about structure in a project without enforcing rules per say. Here are some examples:   Have a Big Balloon with the words “I Broke the Built” on the cubical of the person who breaks the build. The Balloon keeps moving depending on who broke the build last. Another fun rule we have worked in the past is we stop all development the moment the high priority bug screen on our bug tracking system has a scroll bar on it.  Another one is a “GJD” (Great Job Done) batch gifted for doing stupid things like introducing a nasty bug in the system. Anyone who breaks the build adds a dollar to the kitty and when we have enough money either donate it or have a party with that money.   A classic is the Joel Spolsky recommendation: Who ever causes a build break the build baby sits the build till someone else breaks it.  The key here is funny techniques which foster no negative feelings but at the same time encourage people to act responsibly in a fun environment.  Do you believe in using fun to encourage responsible behavior in a team environment?   If yes, what are various innovative ways you use with your projects?  A huge interesting list all in one place would be valuable. "

765,How to do a business case reboot?,"Background  I’ve been tasked with updating the business cases underlying several projects in a program that is significantly over-schedule and over-budget. I’m anticipating that this exercise will also force us to revisit things like our overall development plans, program/project governance structures and our internal communications/engagement strategy.  While the mechanics of this are straight-forward conceptually (i.e. engage end-users, suppliers, etc  to define business capabilities required, benefits they will accrue and their associated costs) I’m concerned about meeting resistance from current project leaders. They have put a lot of time, effort and personal prestige into what has been done to date, and I see a huge opportunity for them to become opponents of change if things aren’t handled well.  My Questions   If you were going through this kind of exercise, what would be the key outputs/products that you would generate? For example, in addition to revisiting the business case would you create/revise a governance plan? Communications strategy? Vision?  What are key aspects that must be addressed from a human perspective in order to help avoid unnecessary opposition/resistance?  "

770,How to manage R&D projects in a R&D department?,"Background  We have got a R&amp;D department within our company. It consists of a few 'core team members' who work full time. They are open-minded technical people who jump into new ideas and try to do whatever they come up with. Also there are a lot of ad-hoc / part-time members who want to do something else than their normal projects or want to try some new technology.  The process, in general goes like this:  idea -> research -> prototype -> sandbox -> project / product.  The first step: ideas is fine; there are lots of ideas, which is good ;) The last step is also fine because when an idea becomes a project it goes out of the R&amp;D and falls into a ""normal"" management and processes.  Problem  The problem we have is with those three steps in the middle. As I said, there are too little core team members to cover all ideas by themselves and this is a bottle neck. On the other hand, when the other ad-hoc staff want to help, they can usually only spend a few hours a week so the progress is very slow and it is very hard to plan their work.  Questions  Is there a third way? To have a reasonable progress without queuing the ideas? How to organise their work so everybody is involved without the trade-offs? "
771,Valuable Information When Managing Multiple Projects,"When managing multiple projects at once, what information would be most valuable to a project manager if the projects are related? Not related?  [Purpose is for the development of new project management software]  Edit: These are great responses! Thanks so much. Very helpful.  Edit: Clarification of question: I do understand the answer and it's part of our mission. There is no reason that project management software should get in the way of management or create a steep learning curve which prevents the true understanding of the software itself.    ""High Level""        Project 1 Project 2 Project 3    All three projects are under the supervision of a p.m. or a team of.  Our team is curious what information is most valuable to see at ""high level"". Although the overall goals of the projects are important, I have a feeling more relates to their success than simply making sure that their large goals or milestones are hit.   Current health of the project in terms of deliverables, over/under budget, and over/under time are obvious to see at that level for each project in a unified way. We were curious what other things came up as a common desire to see at that high level out of project management software. "
772,What would I need to do to transition from a team coach / organizational change agent to a PM?,"A lot of the skills I've picked up as a Lean / Agile coach seem to be relevant to project management, and I've started getting offers of PM work from agencies. Since I coach PMs, I feel like I ought to have a go at actually managing a project at some point.  My people-related skills are pretty good and I have a thorough grounding in both Lean and Agile (including the many places they fail). I've seen projects through from creation to iterative release, coached different roles within projects, and have a good understanding of risk with tools and courage enough to identify and manage it. I'm also into Systems Thinking.  What's the difference between a good coach and a good PM? What additional skills will I need to adopt in order to successfully manage a small project?

773,Non-Systems/Non-IT BRD,"Are BRD and FRD documents required for non-systems/non-IT projects? We are involved in services migration project moving managed website hosting services from a fully-managed external vendor to in-house so we can manage these ourselves. Because this is a transition project which does not require the development or building of any IT systems or infrastructure (we already have the servers to support the website), it can be compared to a construction or engineering project where BRD and FRD documents don’t usually exist.  Usually, the requirements are based on Business Objectives and then functional and non-functional requirements are based on requirements. If this is a transition project which is moving a service from Provider A (external) to Provider B (in-house), is a BRD really required?  The primary business objective is to transition the managed services externally to in-house. If we look at the actual tasks and the work pieces involved in the project to successfully achieve the business objective, a few of these at a very high-level include:    Documentation: Identifying and transferring support documentation. HR: Employing new staff or employing existing vendor staff to manage the hosting serviced internally. Processes: Obtaining from the vendor and introducing new processes to provide the same managed service.    The primary constraints, or non-functional requirements if this were a systems/IT project, would be:    No loss in service delivery during transition. Adhering to company processes and SLAs.   Are BRD and FRD documents required, or would a series of plans (implementation plan, transition plan, continuity plan, SLA, etc.) be sufficient?    Update: thank you so much for the replies and comments so far. I am calling for more viewpoints and comments that can contribute, as such projects are not uncommon but there is scarce information online to refer to. "
774,What should we do with a task that has been blocked,"We're using Agile and Scrum methodology.  For this iteration a coworker had to finish her Development task, which was carried over from last iteration. We thought it will be done in two days and we can start black box testing on it. So we had two tasks: one assigned to her for finishing up the development and one assigned to me to run black box testing on her project. But her task almost took the whole iteration - one day left - and obviously it is impossible for me to do my task now.  So what do you think? What do I suggest to project manager? I do not want my name to be on a task, that for the whole iteration I have been blocked from doing!

I'd appreciate especially unconventional ones.  For me some examples are:   Sticky notes - putting notes on the white board - every thought is a separate note. Engagement/attitude chart - you draw a timeline for the whole sprint/project and you ask each person to draw his engagement/attitude line for this time period. Values should differ from smile [:); happy/fully engaged] to sad [:(; bored, not interested in continuing the project] Brainstorm Voting things - you put some issue on the board and ask people to add whatever comment they want: ""+1"", ""me too"", ""bullshit"", ... Uncompleted sentences - you ask people to complete sentences:  I was most satisfied with ... The real pain was to ...    What other techniques do you use? "
779,Quick win or long term sustainability?,"My project has to deliver middleware components that will support a large, complex system development spanning multiple phases. My phase is due to implement in 6 weeks, with future phases being implemented in 6 months and 12 months from now.  Most of my work is well on track, but we have one component that we are just starting to put in place. We know what is needed to support the current phase, and are confident in our plans to deliver that. However, we don't have a clear view of how the future development phases will be implemented, and so we have not been able to plan our implementation with the future phases in mind. Carrying out the necessary analysis would cost us a couple of weeks, which would delay the overall implementation of the current phase by a week overall.  My question is this: should I opt for the quick implementation that fully meets the current requirement and meets current targets, but does not guarantee an easy future implementation, or should I request a delay to the project, with potential (but unproven) future benefits through avoidance of rework?  We are using a waterfall-based approach, rather than agile, and the technology is relatively new to the organisation. Does this make a difference to your answer? "
780,"If you measure requirement volatility, how do you handle inconsistent requirement size?","I would like to measure requirement volatility but the problem is that our specification is not consistent in size of requirements.

Actually with those big requirements, the volatility will be higher (5 changes to 1 large requirement, which could be 5 changes to 5 requirements). So maybe it could help to visualize lack of granularity? "

What a PM can do other than ask them to study yourselves? A slow poison is what I expect so that the team communication improvement process will not affect project priorities.  UPDATE: Thank you for the answers. Here the communication issues are not just with customer interactions. The teams can be intercultural and/or can contain remote members. So as I said, I am not expecting a fast recovery solution but a medicine to heal the root cause. "
783,How to motivate team members to share knowledge,"I am working in a small team. On the individual level we have well-set knowledge related to our day-to-day activities. Nevertheless I am thinking that if we could share our best practices successfully and train each other, we could save time and resources as well.  We started short joint meetings and other proposals in order to encourage the team to share their daily problems and solutions with each other, but I'd like to increase the speed of this activity. How can I convince the team members to be to take more initiative in knowledge sharing? Can I use more tools to facilitate the process? "
784,Projects to teach university students project management,"What is a good project to teach university students project management principles?  I tried one last semester, producing a video, but found it was too simple and the students did not have to work hard enough (and the network diagrams were too simple because there were too few tasks).  The project needs to fit into a semester and should neither be too large or too small. It should not require any extensive technical knowledge (that is, no software development projects).  Edit: Ideally, the project would require only skills that most never-employed 20 year olds would have. The project should ideally not require the students to spend any money (and the school is not going to give them any either).  Edit 2: Ideally, the project would take a group of 4 people 1 to 2 hours per week (per person) for 13-14 weeks.  Has anyone here had experience doing this? "
785,What should a lean/agile curriculum contain?,"I am helping my team transition to lean and agile, and before a new person joined last month, no one had any experience whatsoever with this approach. Team members have between 1-10 years of experience with software development and other related fields.  One of the most effective ways I've found to bring the team up to speed on this is to do short educational presentations in our weekly meetings. I usually show a short (5-10 mins) video and then facilitate a discussion. We do in-depth workshops on specific topics as the need arises.  Here are some of the topics I've covered:   Agile values and principles User stories (INVEST, splitting) The resource utilization trap T-shaped individuals Testing   Currently, I don't have a detailed plan as to which concepts I should introduce to the team. Up until now, it hadn't been necessary because the team is pretty much starting from scratch, but I'm starting to reach the limits of this ad hoc approach. I'm also considering doing some knowledge transfer with other (non-technical, e.g. marketing, sales, ops, etc.) teams, so a clear structure would help me.  I've been doing some research to build a kind of ""lean/agile curriculum"", and I've found Agile Alliance's Subway Map to Agile Practices quite useful in that regard, but I'm wondering if there are other (possibly more ""meta"") concepts that are missing from there. I'm also wondering about the order those should be presented in. Hence my question:  Q: What should a lean/agile curriculum contain? In what order should lean/agile concepts, practices and tools be introduced to the team? Have you come across such curricula?  NB: I'm looking for advice on ""small a agile"" that applies regardless of the framework (e.g. Scrum) that is used. As well, to be consistent with the approach, each mini-workshop/presentation should deliver value in that team members would be able to apply it to their day-to-day work, and see a change. "
786,Allowing PMs to grade/rate developers,"We're trying to introduce some new/updated ways to quantify developer productivity, and we want to include our Project Managers' thoughts.  What do you think about allowing PMs to ""grade"" or apply some sort of ""rating"" to a developer's task?  The grades would be based on things like the number of bugs that were found, code performance (does it run slow vs. fast), adherence to requirements, etc.  Would developers get upset about PMs grading them on a seemingly arbitrary scale?  How can I do this in a way that won't rock the boat? "
787,Business days calculation for the sprint,"Our team is new to agile. We are in the phase of defining the rules for sprint planning. To start, we are keeping our Sprints at 2 weeks (10 business days). Let's say there is a public holiday in a week: then we are left with 9 business days.  Should the Sprint duration be kept to 10 business days, which means two weeks and 1 more business day? Or should the user stories be chosen in a manner to fit in the 9 business days? "
788,How to deal with unavoidable on-demand tasks in Scrum? Or should we even try?,"I was put in charge of implementing Scrum in my Development Team. Unfortunately, the company I work with has a rather stale structure that does not go well with this framework. The team works on a project that several other teams use/depend on. Besides our own goals we have unexpected feature, integration, support or bugfix requests. Some of them can be filed in the Backlog and wait for their turn, but some absolutely have to be handled ASAP, or ""in real time"" as one of our clients put it.  The situation is far from ideal and I as the Scrum Master do not have the power to protect the Team from this kind of work. I am trying to make the best that I can from the situation we found ourselves in and get as much out of Scrum as possible.  My first question is: how to handle these kinds of requests within the Scrum framework?  I am not a fan of having a separate ""request bucket"" User Story - it either covers up the amount of work that was done or artificially increases the velocity.  Does manipulating the Sprint Backlog in such a broad scope make any sense? Sometimes we would have to move more than a half of our current Sprint Backlog back into Product Backlog to make room for all the on-demand requests.  Perhaps my initial question should be replaced with - is there a way to handle this kind of situation within the Scrum framework?  If there is no way to do it in a reasonable manner - are there any other Agile frameworks that could be of help? "
789,How to get sprint progress from complexity-based estimation?,"We are a small IT team in a startup and are composed as such:   2 frontend engineers (1 senior, 1 junior) 2 backend engineers (1 senior, 1 junior)   We recently (3 months ago) started to use a Scrum methodology to manage our projects. It brought us stability and better communication (thanks mainly to the daily stand up meetings). So overall, it's a good change.  But, one thing remains. We try to estimate our stories by complexity, and assign a certain number of points for each sprint. Our team being small and the experiences in the different aspects of our projects, we have to assign specific stories to specific people in the team.  How can we know if we estimate by complexity, at any given moment, if we're ahead or behind schedule? Our sprints are two weeks long, we can't afford not knowing if we're late until the end of the sprint. Knowing that we missed our deadline at the deadline is pretty useless... And we can't rely on the estimation being diluted across the team, as we are this small.  Another thing I don't really get is we select the stories, let's say 120 points, for 2 weeks. It's a mean of ~30 / person so my engineer's brain is telling me that I should, give or take, do 3 points per day. If on the third day I'm at 9, I'm good. If I'm at 6, I'm behind. But there I'm back on a time based estimation...  I guess I don't get the thing about complexity estimation. I understand the power behind relative estimation, as this answer explains it, but I don't see how I can keep track of the well being of the project while in a sprint.   Nota bene: we do have a burndown chart, which is not that useful for my conceptual problem as it draws a chart of complexity over time. Therefore, can I deduce that the points are time-based in the end ? "
790,How to properly create story maps? (user stories),"I have a website that I need to build and want to properly create story maps. I am just learning how to do this so I would love a bit of help.  My setup: Users:    admins customers   personal business   type1 type2 type3   type3 subtype1 type3 subtype2  type4     My app needs the users to be able to: Register, Log In, Display Profile, Search, Create Posts, Manage business (admins) and so on.  I've been advised to create the story map starting with the users. But I cannot seem to understand how to start. What about starting with the ""processes"" like my first example?  EDIT I would also be interested in understanding if I should have one or multiple or story maps in a project? Does it makes sense to split them into different story maps? Like registration, search, and so on.  Here's what I tried so far:  or  "
791,Is it possible to be agile with a highly technical project?,"I'm working on a small (4-6) team on a project that involves creating a machine learning model to predict the outcome of sports matches real-time. This also involves scraping the data and storing it in a database so we can make real-time predictions. We also will be building a simple website to display this data. The client currently has their own popular sports blog, so they plan for the site we're creating to either be an addition (likely just another tab) to their website or a separate site entirely - the client did not specify which, since it likely depends on the quality of our predictions.  Ignoring the user-facing website aspect for the moment (since the website can definitely be done agile-y), the technical aspect alone could take months. Given a deeply technical task like this, is it possible to use agile? It doesn't seem like demoing the technical work done every sprint would be useful to the stakeholder or users, and I don't know what/if requirements could change. Is this task better suited for waterfall, or is there a way to be agile? "
792,How do I estimate costs for running a finished software project?,"I have an ongoing software development project nearing completition. My question is how I can estimate the necessary budget to run the software once it's finished (run), develop it further, for example due to technological progress (growth) and implementing new functions (innovation).  Is there a common split between those aspects that I can apply to my recurring costs? Or on which factors in my business/the software could a budget split be based?  "
793,Taking over a disorganised team,"I'm about to take over an IT team that lacks organisation between members.  The employees are as follows:   Part time lead software developer &amp; team leader; Onsite; (Me) Full time IT all rounder (Helpdesk, low level sysadmin, software development); Onsite Contracted system administrator; Off site; Moderately expensive Contracted database administrator; Off site; Expensive Contracted system administrator; Off site; Expensive   I need to optimise my time managing this team since I'm doing majority of development for our systems and I'm part time (3-4 days a week). I therefore have a few questions:   What overarching advice could you give managing a remote team? I use agile scrum (online board) in my own development, should I integrate this team into a my scrum board so we can track issues between ourselves in sprints? If so, should I use a single board for the whole team or split it up?  "
794,Varying Sprint cycle in a project,Is it possible to have a project with varying Sprint cycle? Example: in a product implementation project initial few sprints could be a month long because of multiple dependencies and lack of clarity but as we move forward the cycle becomes say 2 weeks long.  What all changes in the system (Like Target Process) a PM/Scrum Master has to do? 
795,"In a scrum development environment, management keeps adding stories in the sprint","In a company, they have been trying to implement scrum for something less than a year, and they have made some good progress. However, in the last 4-5 months and prior to the release of the software, management and PO have been adding things in the sprint all the time, therefore altering the priority and focus of the sprint. At the end of the sprints, things are half done, or not started at all, and some are done. This seems ok though, as they will be delivered in the next sprint, or the sprint after. The PO and management know that they shouldn't be doing this, however time is very limited to go live with the new product and if there is no business, there is no team, and therefore, no scrum. The morning scrums are are report to the manager of what is going on, and a ping pong of suggestions for possible solutions. The manager insists that this is the right forum to coordinate the team.  On the other hand, the manager has advised that he wants to keep the scrum values, and progress scrum in the team, it's just that right now, time is of the essence and things have to be delivered as soon as possible before the deadline. The Scrum Master, seeing the problem, he understands that priorities will keep coming up, sprints will keep re-shifting, and has given up trying to change this; he also understands that certain pieces of the software have to come on an urgent basis in order to be delivered. Additionally, ""last moment additions"", albeit essential, are added in the sprint or backlog, that need to be done tomorrow (sometimes the latter are, objectively speaking, non-negotiable, as they have to be delivered for the software to work).  To top all these, the company has issues in its infrastructure, such as environments not working, and development getting halted about 20% of the time due to external dependencies.  The company has client commitments which it is trying to meet. Therefore, on one hand they want to do scrum, on the other it just seems like a waterfall methodology labelled as ""scrum"".  Is there hope in this company in terms of appreciating what needs to be done in order to start implementing scrum? How can they stop adding things in the sprint backlog, and focus on actually delivering whole sprints instead of having half-done stories at the end? "
796,"Function Point value, which is better","Based on FP table here:  [website]Here are average FP value for 3 different languages  Java --> 53  J2EE --> 46  .Net --> 57  As I understand the FP estimation uses these values to calculate the effort size. Example: My FP estimation provides a size of 10, so the effort size will be:  Java --> 530  J2EE --> 460  .Net --> 570  Considering this should I choose J2EE as the language of choice because it has the lowest effort value size? Does a lower FP average value mean lesser effort required? If so why? "
797,Could a Knowledge Manager be a Project Manager?,"The Knowledge Manager role has evolved drastically from that of one involving the creation and maintenance of knowledge repositories to one that involves influencing the culture of an organization toward improved knowledge sharing, reuse, learning, collaboration and innovation.  I am thinking about this role who has also gained knowledge about the different projects running within an organization and is heavily involved in future plans.  Could I consider this resource as a potential Project Manager? If so, what key elements or strategy would you recommend to develop this role accordingly?  "
798,How to start Data Warehouse project in agile projects when client ask just some reports?,"Agile project management prevents coding for the future. Our client asks some reports which can be coded withing the schema of existing database structure, but the best practices strongly suggest that the client really aims for some kind of  data warehousing solution. Neither our company nor our client is ready for upfront investments and additional work that will bring rewards in future only. What to do? 1) Be satisfied with the present status quo and go with suboptimal design of reports with low maintainability? 2) strongly press for warehousing solution. Who makes such decisions? Developers see the problem, client and management does not see the problem and don't understand the concerns of developers. What should be done in this situation, what behaviour are expected by the best practices of project management methodologies? "
799,Is it possible to forecast when a scrum team will complete the product backlog?,"This question is related to this question but I couldn't find this part answered there.  I am part of a large project whose entire product backlog has been sized in story-points. The estimate is roughly based on effort and assumes a certain amount of effort per SP.  My goal initially was to establish average velocity (in SP) per sprint of the team and then use this as a forecasting metric against the rest of the backlog (assuming that is also sized in SP).  Since the entire product backlog is not fully groomed there are several items that are not fully defined.   Is it possible to use the above method to arrive at an accurate plan/ forecast ? What potential pitfalls could this run into ? What other methods, if any, can be used to forecast completion date for the entire product backlog. "
800,How do you plan for risks in your project's estimates?,"I have been working on the risk-management topic in software development for a while. According to the different literature there could be knowns knowns (typical risks), known unknowns (product related risks), and unknown unknowns (black swans).   known knowns  You have some industry statistics and can use some simulations (e.g. RISKOLOGY) so you can add say 20% to scope and schedule. known unknowns  Here you can brainstorm with the team and come up with the list of project related risks, and come up with preventive actions and estimate them, so these can be included into the scope. But what about the remainder of the known unknowns? Should you plan for contingencies? How much? 10%? black swans  Just plan for contingency? How much? 20-30%?   How do you plan for these risks at the project initiation or planning phase, especially when customer asks for estimates? How do you usually present all these different types of risks to the customer, especially if the risks double the budget or schedule estimates? "
801,How do you financially quantify the 'holding cost' of not releasing items until you have a big batch?,"In Don Reinertsen's book - Principles of Product Development Flow - the tradeoff between release size (number of stories) and release cost (regression test cost and release cost) is described like this:    In Ken Rubin's book - Essential Scrum - he talks about the benefits of smaller release sizes - being:   Reduced cycle time Reduced flow variability Accelerate feedback Lower risk of failure Reduced overhead Increased motivation and urgency Reduced cost and schedule growth   He also uses the following way of describing this tradeoff:    They both talk about this in terms of a U-curve optimisation problem. The challenge is how to quantify this.   Now assume:  The above has the form of   cost = n*BS + m/BS    with    n = holding cost factor, m = transaction cost factor and BS= batch size.   You have to find the zero crossing of the first derivative for the minimum. The first derivative for the above is  n - m/(BS^2)   When setting that to zero you find  min cost = sqrt(m/n)   But how do you find the cost of releasing now vs releasing in six months? What was the opportunity cost?   My question is: How do you financially quantify the 'holding cost' of not releasing items until you have a big batch? "
802,What are good ways to stimulate and encourage yourself as Project Manager or Project Leader?,"I have the impression that people (including myself, I'm not going to be ignorant) have the nature of locking themselves up if they have an 'off day'. It's a lacking of inspiration, stimulation and encouragement to go on sometimes.  Of course as a good PM or PL, you want to have the occurence of these periods as low as possible. As a PM or PL, people depend on your input and on your outcomes and if you slow down, probably the whole project slows down.  How do you keep yourself motivated on days that you cannot find the drive to go for it 100%? What are your tricks to keep you fresh and motivated?  For example: If I have a bad day (and it only happens once every few years) I oblige myself to go to one of my colleagues and ask for something. No mather what, even if it is how it's going with his work, I always come back a bit refreshed. Seeying other people work, often stimulates me to get back on track with my own job. "
803,How to implement Epics on Gitlab without Enterprise Edition?,"We have used Gitlab for 4 years now in our organization, and are growing to the point where we are implementing Agile and trying to follow Epics, Features, User Stories, and Tasks.  We are struggling to find a way to implement this in the Gitlab Free Edition, since there is no mechanism to associate issues with other issues (other than having a ""mention"" or ""reference"").  I could create a label called ""Epic"" and create Epics as issues, just assigning them that label.  Does anyone then know of a good way to associate issues to that particular Epic?  I can list them out as a bullet point.  Even if I do that, I have no nice way to see them on an issue board unless I create a label for that particular epic as well (e.g., ""Epic001"") and label them all with it.  Thoughts?  I'd love Enterprise Edition, but it's insanely expensive. "
804,DevOps and support organization,"Nowadays companies go into devops practices to boost productivity.  In our case we (3rd party outsourcing vendor) developed a first version of the product for our client  , it’s cloud based platform.  We do have tests, the deployment is semi-automated since there are fashion manual steps (like AD requests) . We don’t have continuous delivery and deployment yet, though. During development, we cooperated with client IT ops so they contributed to the product development (they built images, deployed to pre-prod, prod, fixed issues related to client infrastructure)  Now it’s time to go-live and client wants to formalize support but still follow devops practices.  For me it’s quite hard to understand how this can be built.   For example: If we keep on implementing new features and have a team working on the product, we can spend % of development time on support requests (2 and 3rd level of support), so that devs are integrated into ops, and understand the pain of users or ops, can not only fix issues but also bring some improvements to deployment, monitoring etc. to make product more reliable, faster and deliver value to business quicker.   But what if there is no new features development and just support (with 2nd and 3rd level) that either configuration and standard operations according to runbook (2nd level) or defects fixing on 3rd level.  Since those are OPEX for clients they don’t tend to invest in this – hence there is no real opportunity (in terms of efforts spent) to follow and foster good devops practices during just support with no active development.   What do you think ? Is it possible to run support in devops mode with no active product development ?  how this can be done ? "
805,Example Gantt charts in proposals - how to remove dates in MS Project?,"We are a B2B service provider.  Many of our potential customers want to see a Gantt chart in the proposal.  These are created based on a broadly estimated start date.   Our problem: our clients aren't understanding (or reading in our proposal) that the Gantt was only based on an example start date with the caveat they sign the proposal promptly and send us the necessary items to allow us to start our work.  I've figured out how to print a Gantt with durations and numbered days across the top (in MS project), however I am wondering if there was a prettier way to do this? Can I make a new project with no actual dates and starting on Day 0?  And having a milestone as Day X?  Thanks! "
806,Applying Agile Methodolgies to a conversion project,I'm new to agile but would like to apply it's methodologies to a software project where we are tasked with converting a Mathcad document into a web application.  We are typically a P&amp;D organization  Are all the steps of Agile still applicable or would you tailor it. For instance do I still ask the client for a Business case and a product vision statement? Or do we skip that?   Would I still sit with the client and collaborate on user stories or do I reverse engineer them from the Mathcad functionality?  Or maybe Agile is not applicabale at all for such a project. 
807,What pro forma documents do people use to talk to clients about web development,"This is a very general question and I believe it will be relevant to other people in my situation.  I've been involved as a hobbyist in web design and development for over 2 years now. I have produced a number of websites but charged nothing or a token gesture to the people (my friends) that I've worked with.  Going forward as a freelance web developer, I'd like to know what tools do people use to engage their clients with  In all my successful ventures and going forward, I have used bootstrap, it offers the versatility of being designed from mobile devices upwards (I explain that to the client).  One issue with bootstrap, is, it doesn't provide a pretty backend WYSIWYG editor (like wordpress does) for the client to use - This means that I cannot charge a one-off payment to the client but instead have to negotiate a long term arrangement. The long term arrangement isn't the issue, but getting there is. In many cases clients want a solution they can manage themselves, and I refuse to use wordpress (snob - maybe).    So, these are my questions:   Negotiation: Whats the best way to negotiate a long term arrangement in terms of webpage design, hosting and ongoing maintenance? I gather charging an hourly rate for work done when the site is complete is the obvious answer but how do people factor this in to their original project proposal?   Template Documents: Are there any pro forma documents used for web design and costing that people have found to be beneficial? Time scales: When it comes to proposing time scales for the implementation and having read: How granular should an estimate be for building a web page? are their any pro forma documents that people use to do that?   "
808,What are good ways to structure a group that has both a product development team and a professional services team,"I am the development manager for a small software company. My team focuses on developing our product, and we have some partner companies that do the ""professional services"" work for our product: things like developing custom add-ons and doing user training and system implementation. We are planning to start doing some of that professional services work in-house, because some customers have said that they would feel more comfortable working directly with us.  Does anyone have experience with this kind of thing? I'm trying to figure out how to structure the development resources for this new team.  One option that comes to mind is to just add some new people to our main development team and then have everyone rotate through that job. This would help spread the knowledge around, but I think that some of the developers would be unhappy about switching projects like that.  Another option would be to form a separate development team to be responsible for the new services work. This ensures that people can focus on the work that they like best, but it has the downside that the new team might not inherit the strong culture of quality that our main team has.  Are there any other options that I'm overlooking? "
809,Difference in %complete after rescheduling between MSP 2007 and 2010,"I have a file that has a single task. its fixed duration and is not effort driven and no resource is defined. duration is set to 10 days. after 5 days, %complete is 10%. after entering this data and rescheduling, in MSP 2007 duration and %complete remain constant (10% and 10days), while in MSP 2010 %complete decreases to 7% and duration increases to 14 days! Why??! Another question: I set task type as fixed unit and other conditions remain constant as described before, after rescheduling in MSP 2010, task will split and finish date changes. (for example increases 4 days). Problem happens when I copy %complete column on itself. In this case, finish date returns to its original value (decreases 4 days.) "
810,"In Agile, what do you call the costs of building infrastructure for the first release?","Stakeholders who are new to agile are expecting thin slices of value per each release, so when we start new projects they are confused when we need large infrastructure costs.   We minimise the infrastructure costs to those enabling that first customer feature, but in some large enterprise projects, the infrastructure costs are significantly larger than the first feature.      Stakeholders will usually go through the same thought process, along the lines of   This is not a thin slice, so its not agile. Can we start with the second feature? (nice try) Can you make it smaller? (let's assume we cannot go smaller, for the sake of this question)   I've read about classifying the infrastructure costs as business value rather than customer value, but this question is more related to the initial (large) cost of the business value and how we can describe that.    Is there an industry agile-friendly term to describe this initial cost?   "
811,Immediately assign tasks to everyone or task by task?,"There are more people working on the project. I created like 50 tasks. The project is programming of an application. I am a project manager here.   I have 2 options:   Assign all tasks to corresponding person and mark it by priority (1 to 5). If someone is faster, I re-assign the task to him.  Assign only a couple of task to each person and assign other based on their progress   Questions for 1 &amp; 2.    What if a person starts working and marks a task as Accepted, and I need to reassign it to another person? Mark it as New on re-assign? If many tasks are of the same priority, a person in charge may chose which one to take. Good or bad? How many tasks to assign for each person? How many active tasks should have each person?   The main goal is to finish the project quickly but preserving quality. I noticed that guys take tasks as they want. That is why I thought if assigning all tasks to them is the wrong way to do it. Maybe the proper way is to have a bunch of unassigned tasks, which I assign to those person who finalize their tasks the quickest.   So the main issue is how to properly assign tasks to my guys.  "
812,PM doesn't agree with company-wide rule - what should they do?,"Consider a PM who has his own strong opinion how project management should look like. Now, the organization he works for takes a bit different, more loose and more flexible, approach.  A couple of examples: PM would like to see daily reporting while organization enforces weekly reporting on project teams or PM expects all the dates, even those with low priority, would be kept, while managers in the company often react to changing situation sacrificing some of low priority tasks in order to adjust to new high priority requests from their customers.  Now, PM tried to discuss with senior management about how he'd like projects to look like but they turned his request down leaving much flexibility to project teams.  What should PM do in such situation? Should he accept the way things look like? "
813,Measuring team capacity for upcoming sprint on a Scrum Team,"As a Scrum Master, I have been tasked with helping the team understand its capacity for an upcoming sprint. This capacity, along with the product backlog, the latest increment, and past team performance are all artifacts I need before we dive into Sprint Planning.  As of today, I use the following to calculate team capacity:     Known outages (vacation, training, company holidays, conferences, etc.)      a conservative 10% of full sprint length time for refinement      Scrum events (Planning time itself, Daily Scrum, Sprint Review, and Sprint Retro)   My question: what am I missing? What else should I be taking into account to help my team understand its capacity for forecasting future work? "
814,How to track change requests over a functional document,"Functional requirements tend to mature as the time goes by, and the initial versions of requirements for a project are usually based on assumptions (otherwise the work would never start).  As the development cycles evolves, though, changes to the original requirements are required to be applied.   In this specific case, the development is still ongoing, based on a master MS Word document containing functional specs plus a lot of change request (properly tracked separately from the functional document).  Question: How to correctly track these change requests?  Assumption: The master functional doc should reflect all change requests (as that's the document to be used in the future for reference purposes),   Open point: I'm not sure if I should only spread comments over the original version, completely remove the updated pieces, use the 'tracking changes' functionality or have a rewritten Functional document.  Any thoughts? "

816,MS Project: How to set a Resource work by hour regardless of work days?,"Please kindly help me find way to solve in MS Project.  I have two Resources below:  Employee_A = 4 hours per week only, but can work any day Employee_B = 12 hours per week only, but can work any day   MS Project just lets me put how many hours a resource can work on a certain day. But what if my resource can work any day as long as he completes the given hours? How can I setup these info to MS Project?  Please really needs help. Thank you very much. "
817,What should be ideal ratio of developers and testers?,I am in the process of hiring resources for testing team. I have none currently.  What should be the number of testers if my developers are 10?  Is there any rule of thumb which specifies how many testers should be there for given number of developers?  Please let me know. 
818,What are non-functional quantitative requirements?,"I got the following question for homework but I am confused on what is being asked. I'm not looking for you to give me the answers I am just wondering what non-functional quantitative requirements are? I thought non-functional requirements, such as as usability, maintainability, etc., were qualitative?     Specify and comment on seven non-functional quantitative requirements for an e-commerce application. You should choose one sub-characteristic from each of the main characteristics [from ISO 9126].  "
819,How to Handle a Funding Overrun on a Time and Materials (T&M) Contract,"Here is the scenario:  You are the PM of a new T&amp;M contract that has a [tex]1,000,000 and a one-year period of performance (POP).  Scope is fluid, consistent with a T&amp;M-type contract.  Approximately 30% in the POP, about three and half months in duration, you are overrunning your revenue and underrunning your costs, producing a 28% margin at that time and a 30% margin estimated at completion.  At the current burn rate, you are projecting that you will hit the $1,000,000 funding level early, at the 80% mark of the period of performance.    So with two and half months remaining for which you will not have any more available funds to bill the client, and with the additional 10% in margin that you are accruing, and with fluid scope, what would be your course of action with the client?  If the client was private sector?  If the client was public sector?  I think, in reality, there is a canonical answer to this question but, as well, there are likely many different practices out there to handle this type of scenario.  I am hoping this generates a few common practices out there. "
820,Feasability report and the kickoff meeting,"Is feasability study related to kick off meeting?  My understanding is that the feasability study is done before the contracts are signed to ensure that the project is 'feasible'.  But my question is that, is there a need to mention/present the feasibility report in the kickoff meeting? What is the norm? "

822,How to manage framework changes?,"I'll try to be concise so as to not make this into a blog post. If there are specific questions, let me know and I'll do my best to answer them.  Basically, I'm interested in what methodologies people have come up with, and what benefits and short-falls they experienced, for managing the transition of a project from one framework (or one programming language, or one technology stack) to another.  The Setup  Suppose you had a simple web application written in a once-popular back-end framework that ran on a single Apache/Nginx/whatever server and delivered server-side rendered pages. Each time a user clicks a link to perform an action, the request is sent to the server, the one server handles the request, connects to the one database, makes the changes, then delivers a new page with the results of their action visible.  Now suppose 10 years down the line your app has grown into a widely popular behemoth and you're running into scaling concerns, you're having performance issues, you can't create features very quickly because all of the code is tightly coupled, some big names have started depending on your service being ""Always Available"" ™, or for some other reason you now need to change the engine underlying your app.  After weeks of research you may have made one small decisions like ""Let's use React and offload a lot of the processing and display logic to the client's CPU"", or you may have made multiple decisions involving splitting out your app into several micro-services and re-inventing the database using a map-reduce algorithm and a splash of machine learning. Whatever the final decision was, you need to retain feature parity with your old app and get it moved over to the new framework.  The Question  This question isn't about the technical details of this decision (e.g. ""How do you do that"") -- this is about the managerial details of this decision. How do you manage such a change?  Do you treat it like you're building a new app from scratch and every feature in the old app is just a user story in the new one?  Or do you treat it as a new feature for the existing app?  Should you branch off of the old code and begin the rework on a new branch of the old repository?  Or should you start a new repository for the new framework, since merge conflicts are not only expected but almost a roadblock as your underlying models and assumptions could be entirely different?  What becomes of the old app during the transitional period? Should you feature-freeze it to make parity easier? Or should you continue to develop in parallel?  I've seen a lot of methodologies for managing projects and I've picked and chosen my favorite tools from everything I've seen. But I've never seen someone manage to change frameworks well. Even something supposedly simple like moving from ReactJS to Vue (they serve the same purpose, they're both written in JavaScript, and many of the underlying assumptions and mental models are identical) can lead to months of development and wasted time before the change is scrapped because it just wasn't worth the effort.  Tags  I literally had no idea what tags to choose. Please help. "
823,Caution or Waste?,"Are there any strict definitions regarding the difference between caution/security/safety and waste? For example, consider the following scenarios:  1:     ""We just finished this. We'd better test it to make sure it actually works.""   2:     ""We're going live in a week. We'd better re-test this thing to make sure it still works.""   3:     ""We're going live tomorrow. We'd better re-test this thing.""      ""I don't think we've actually changed anything, though.""      ""Are you 100% sure?""      ""99%.""      ""Then we'd better test it again, to be safe.""   4:     ""Okay, it passed. Are we done?""      ""No, run it one more time to be sure.""      ""...Why?""      ""It's possible you made a mistake when testing it. Run it five times, to be completely certain.""   Which of these (if any) would be considered as waste? Which as just being cautious/safe? Is there a formal metric for determining such, or is it opinion-based? "
824,Resource Calendars in Microsoft Project 2003,"I have developers in Quebec and in Ontario, and each province has different holidays.  In MS Project 2003, I selected Tools/Working Time and created two calendars called Ontario and Quebec and filled out the holidays appropriate for each.  In my resource sheet, I made the base calendar for each developer match their province.  With that in place, I created a task for a Quebec developer that takes 9 days and scheduled it as Must Start On Monday June 18th.  There is a holiday in the Quebec calendar for June 25th, so I assumed that the end date would come out as Friday, June 29th, but it shows up as Thursday.  MS Project seems to ignore the resource calendar when scheduling this task.  Shouldn't MS Project notice that the specified resource is not available on June 25th in this case?  Or have I misunderstood how the resource calendar works?  Thanks, Mike. "
825,Project manager must be the chief recruiter?,"Is it correct to think that a project manager should also carry the role of a recruiter and that it is entirely wrong to separate the PM role from the recruiter role?   Reasons:    The project manager can explain best what is to be done on a position, since he is the one giving the daily tasks and coordinating work, he keeps both a sense of the big picture and the smallest detail of work;  The project manager knows the organisational culture and can identify people with the behaviour that will fit into company's or project's culture;  The project manager can come up with the best pre-screening testing tasks, since he gives around tasks every day and he is skilled in leveraging the difficulty and scope of tasks;  The project manager bears responsibility over the success of a project and he bears the brunt of interpersonal conflicts in the team, issues with motivation and productivity, etc. Thus he should have the biggest say who should be sourced, screened and hired, above anyone else. (By the same token he should have full power to fire people, but this is another topic).   Is it correct? "
826,Scrum job title,"I know that in Scrum there is only three role, Product Owner, Scrum Master and Development Team. As a sign of change we must be important, not only understand these roles, but also start to change the job title to an homogenic form as Developer, Scrum Master and Product Owner. Maybe this is pointless, but we try to set an identity to the team, currently there is a mixture of titles and departments for the members of the same Development Team and we wan to change it. So how does an organization work this thing?  A restructure of this is part of implement scrum or this don't care?  Thanks for your advise "
827,What should a UI designer know and how to deliver this knowledge to him?,"I manage a few development teams at the moment. Each team develops different projects for different clients.  Right now I'm trying to let team leads work with clients directly without me, but the problem is that none of them has good experience designing UI. I do. We have a designer, who I'm trying to teach how to create UI the way I do. The problem is that she is neither into business nor into development, so her designs are quite typical: as beautiful as useless and/or difficult to implement.   So, what do I do with designs? It consumes a significant portion of my time each week...  Let's summarize:   The designer creates interfaces that are difficult to develop. Okay, I've handled to her my own sketch design system and introduced to main UI frameworks that we use. She is getting better at this. The designer isn't into business. She doesn't know when it makes sense to spend money on more complex things and when we should just make it simple and improve when needed. Okay, I may be able to put this responsibility on the Product Owner. The designer doesn't know all the intricacies of a product, PO's vision and user feedback. What do I do about it? If I'll ask her to consume all this information, then she'll be spending more time learning the product, than actually designing it.  "
828,How to avoid contention in resource management when delivery managers can access availability?,"The setting is >500 people IT services. You can think of it as a staffing agency, we only do T&amp;M, although we hire our consultants (we have a bench). We do not really mange projects, what delivery managers focus on is making sure a client is happy and people are filling their timesheets.   We are struggling with the following:  Information about availability of people for projects is restricted to the resource management team. This includes peoples’ profiles, too (who is available, since when, skillset, etc.). This hampers planning and transparency for delivery managers, who are in charge of keeping their projects staffed, because all information is centralized and resource manager is a ""global gatekeeper"". He is the only person able to answer resourcing questions and provide people.  We have tried to open information on availability and profiles of people to delivery managers, but it ended up in contention, managers effectively skipping resource planning, fighting for best resources, etc.  How to address this? Is there a way to avoid contention whilst maintaining resource availability information available to managers? Any best practices?  I have ability to ""influence"" this process, but I feel that without strong ""proof"" or meritocratic approach I will not be able execute on it. "
829,How to avoid the planning fallacy?,The planning fallacy appears especially frequently when estimating tasks in software development. However agile estimation methods like planning poker etc. don't seem to be designed to avoid this problem.  So what do you do to avoid the planning fallacy when estimating tasks or tickets in IT projects? Are there any product management methodologies or best practices which are designed to avoid this common fallacy? 
830,Best way to divide & assign development work on projects?,"Currently I'm part of a development team which create software and web applications; And I get assigned to tasks randomly (kind of); most of the time I'm the only one working on a certain project, as other co-workers have another project assigned to them individually.  I feel that it is extremely difficult to keep to deadlines when at the same time you have to solve issues you come across, which you can't always predict a time frame for, and so most of my tasks that keep getting assigned to me start stacking on top of each other, and some being more important than others I have to sack most of the tasks given to me earlier on to complete the more urgent ones that came in late.  What is the best way to complete projects efficiently? Should projects be assigned to more than one individual, resulting in more projects overall to have no one actively working on them? Is it something I might be doing wrong? Should tasks by assigned by asking the development team who's up for it/who will be capable enough? Or who has less tasks?  How do you think employees in my position should be assigned in order to complete a project successfully with least amount of truble? "
831,How to run an effective agile team within a rules based organisation,"How to align an Agile team's working agreements within the boundaries (""rules"") set by the organisation.  e.g. manager says you have to be at work at 10am and can only leave after 5pm.      you have to email the manager before working from home.  Has anyone got experience with this type of 'rules' based organisation which still considers their teams agile?  My objective here is two fold:   Work with the organisation to improve their approach. Should they be setting rules? Is there a better way of setting these boundaries for the team? Understand what is best for an agile team. Should they define when and where they work? etc.   Update: I guess what I am trying to figure out is how can a team be autonomous if you are telling them where to work and when to work.   Google, for example, lets the developers work wherever and whenever as long as they deliver. So I guess I am trying to achieve too much, but I want to know: is it possible to make delivery of working software the expected output without being super rigid about when and where the team works? "
832,Start RUP elaboration phase when Inception is not finished yet,"Question for RUP (Rational Unified Process) experts.  We are going to have an inception phase on the project where we will provide project management plan, software requirements specification (SRS), etc.  However, according to the methodology, we should not start the elaboration phase until artifacts from the Inception phase are accepted by the client/stakeholders.  I'd like to utilize resources as much as I can, so my idea is to provide the artifacts for acceptance, start elaboration phase right away, and then, during the Acceptance phase, do some improvements to design documents if such are needed. This lets me to save some time and not just find ways for acceptance.  Would that work? Or there are other approaches? "
833,What are the material / steps / knowledge required for a Scrum Master to run a PMO?,"Background  Recently I started to work in a new company that does not have any methodology in place, but the company does have an idea to set up a PMO to act as a central hub to gather and to run all the projects the company is about to do.   At the moment I'm the only one there to take care of all the foundation work. Basically the company wants me to do is to build the processes for governance of projects and to build PM process flows.  Advice Needed  I do have experience in leading a technical team and managing a project, but where I am right now is more towards the business side. I'm surrounded by people who are not technical. Many of them are marketers and also C-level people. I am experiencing a different culture here.  What are the material / steps / knowledge required for a Scrum Master like me to run a PMO? I'm a bit overwhelmed and stressed about the term PPM, other PMP, and ITIL, etc. What will you do as an Agile person to lead the PMO? "
834,How to deal with bad attitude in a scrum team?,"I'm the Scrum Master of a 7-person team. I've proposed and leaded Scrum implementation with open management support. One of the reasons for proposing Scrum, was also to address the attitude of the ""Project Manager"".  He has a very bossy attitude with ""inferiors"", he is very shy, fearful and flattering with the CEO, and he's used to get his own way through hiding information, insults, arrogance, machinations, and harming reputations. I'm being kind.  From what I write, you could probably think that I'm not the right person for the Scrum Master role... but I'm really the proposer of Scrum. At the moment, I'm the only person available to fill the role and I really believe in many values contained in the Scrum guide.  So the question is:   given the situation described, considering that my point of view is shared by other members of the team (but also that I am directly affected by this kind of behaviour), considering that, however, the person in question is very good at his job (outside of the team with customers) and proposing his removal would not be acceptable,  how should I, as a Scrum Master, deal with this situation?   Should I say nothing in particular and trying to address ""real concrete problems"" occurring during our work?  Should I try to address the problem personally in a one-to-one conversations? Wouldn't it be too difficult to control my emotions, avoiding myself being ""bossy"" and imposing rules?   Should I speak with him in general about respect, transparency, openness, etc? Or should I be very hard-line about unacceptable behaviour?  Should I speak with the CEO or senior management? Maybe in general terms, asking for support without being specific? I'm afraid that a one-to-one conversation in the above terms will lead to my destruction (""who are you to teach me that"" kind of things).  I've no experience in psychology or conflict management. "
835,Quality Improvement Projects in Operational Environments,"The idea here is to improve the quality of the service delivered by the Operations Team in a department responsible for the distribution of Variable Marketing Payments.  This team primarily creates programmes to generate the discount premiums to customers.  Following a Customer Satisfaction Survey it has been raised that the Quality of the service needs to improve. The knowledge of the business and the system is limited, therefore the team is not in a position to advise better practises to customers in order to maximise their premiums according to the customer's specific requirements. This issue has been discussed several times with Senior Management who has now acknowledge that there is an issue and wants a plan to resolve this.  My proposal is to run this as a formal project, Operational Quality Improvement Project, which at least requires:   Business Case - actual issue, costs, business options, benefits, risks... Planning - tasks and timescales to achieve the prime goal... Implementation and Control    Unfortunately, Senior Management does not consider this as a Project because it's not software related (incredible!!!), they believe this is something that can happen on the fly.   I strongly believe that in order to improve the quality of the programmes delivered the team requires a better understanding of the business, the system and the different usage thus training requirements from an expert in the subjects are a  MUST. This training has costs implications; hiring an expert and the time that the team will invest on training sessions would impact the creation of Variable Marketing programmes. Again, planning is required to mitigate the impact to our customers. Finally, we would also need to monitor the success of the project, for example by reissuing Customer Satisfaction Surveys.  Do you have any suggestions to support my proposal to Senior Management? What other aspects should we need to take into account to present this as a formal project?  "
836,How to deal with huge data selection requirement,"I would like to discuss about a business requirement from the client. The requirement is to allow the user to select a huge amount of data.  Let me try to explain with an example.  As a portfolio manager, I should be able to select a list of models from the list, so that I can create a portfolio.   Here, there can be 20000+ models in the market. So the application will be jammed if we allow the user to select all the models when creating a portfolio. The client might not use more than 10 models when creating a portfolio in real scenario. But there is a requirement to select all the models available in the system.  How should I handle this scenario? Do you have any alternate ways to fulfill this requirement? "
837,How to calculate Present Value and Net Present Value?,"I´m doing a feasibility study to check the benefits of an investment in a certain tool. My table shows the savings and the costs in the project over 4 years. So, I´m trying to understand how to apply the Present Value and Net Present Value. I know the formulas, but i don´t know how to apply it in a real situation.  Should I:   Calculate the discount rates in every year of every item or; Only in the Cash Flow Line or; Only in the Total Savings and Total Costs line?   The table would be something like this. I applied the discount rate in the Cash Flow line (Savings-Costs). I´m considering the discount rate a given rate used by my company for this project:    And, about the NPV, should I use the Cash Flow without the discount rate applied? "
838,Should I be concerned that the PM has never looked at the product?,"After two years on a project I finally worked face-to-face with the Project Manager yesterday. The project we work on has one major deliverable - a web site. The project team has roughly 20 people working on it.  It came as a surprise to me to find out that the PM had never looked at the website before.  I can see this in a couple of different lights. On one hand, the PM's expertise is in managing the team and the resources, why should they care what the product looks like? On the other hand, a client is ponying up millions for the site and the support services, and you might expect a little more knowledge on the part of the PM regarding the deliverable.  Should I be concerned by this? Does such a lack of knowledge cause problems? Or can the PM act optimally without knowledge of the deliverable? "
839,How can I handle a client's client who is upset with bugs but refuses to use any kind of Project Management?,"I am a programming/engineering freelancer working as a consultant for a mid-sized corporation. This mid-sized corporation has many clients, including a very large financial company (one of the top 10 financial companies in the world), who we will call ""Client X"". Years ago (before I started working here), my client created a custom fulfillment website for Client X.  I was originally hired to simply implement a new design over the website's existing infrastructure, but soon, I was being given new tasks - bug fixes, small enhancements - and then larger projects - new applications for the website, etc..  The majority of these tasks and projects have been managed using very rudimentary spreadsheets, email communication, and the occasional meeting. I have continually asked for Functional Specifications and/or Business Rules documents from Client X, but they never respond with either. Instead, I'm given a list of one-line tasks/projects and deadlines for each (which are usually unreasonable).  In addition to this, Client X rarely helps with any User Acceptance Testing, and instead expect me to simply take their requests, create them, and deploy and have everything work exactly as they requested.  When bugs occur, their feathers get very ruffled. They complain about the bugs, and about the time it takes to fix them, etc..  Now, I know that as the sole software engineer for my client, I am responsible for the bugs. However, I feel without proper Project Management, it is more difficult to create bug-free code. As a result of lack of assistance from Client X, I've had to make myself responsible for performing all of the following tasks for each project:   Writing Functional Specifications Creating Mock-ups Writing Technical Specifications Programming QA Testing  User Acceptance Testing Deployment Bug fixes Project/Task Updates to the client among other things....   Now, don't get me wrong, I enjoy each step of the process - I'm a perfectionist, and I like to be organized. However, I have to admit, that I'm not a great QA or User Acceptance Tester. I'm not a ""normal"" user of the website in question, so I can't think of every scenario to test. Also, the time it would take to properly test each feature takes away from time that I could be working on other projects for Client X.   It's a catch 22: they want their tasks/projects done quickly and bug-free, but they don't realize that those two things don't always exist together.  The first step I've taken is to start writing Testing Scripts, and to run through these for each task/project I work on.   But, there are drawbacks here as well. I'm being paid as a Programmer/Software Engineer. I have no problem being paid my existing rate to test applications/features, but it seems ridiculous to me to pay me as much as they are for this aspect, when they could be paying someone a lot less (idk, $15-20/hour?) to be a tester. Client X complains about the financial implications of me working on bug fixes, but to me, it would just make sense to hire a tester for a lot less money to run test scripts, and free up my time to write code.  I've tried explaining these things to my supervisor, who is 1. the liaison for Client X 2. the original programmer for the website, and 3. a VP for my client, but he sticks to the old adage of ""the customer is always right"", and thinks that if they don't want to write Functional Specifications and they don't want to help test and they don't want to use proper Project Management, that WE have to deal with it.  So, what are some ways I can ""deal"" with this environment/client? "
840,Number of people in a team that need to communicate with the client?,"Is it more useful that all the people in a team to communicate with the client or should there be one person - i.e. the project manager that does all the communication and then informs the other members of the team?  Because we have a client, that likes to have his hands on and get informed on everything that is being done and communicate with each member of the team separately. This has caused a lot of problems to us in terms of communicating with each other etc.  Should we restructure the way we communicate with the client? Would we impose more problems if communication is channeled trough only two people? "
841,Shared resources in the Spotify model,"A company is trying to adopt the Spotify model, with tribes, squads, chapters etc. They came up with around 6-7 tribes. However they have a part of it, UX/UI that is needed on an ad-hoc basis from each tribe's squads i.e. they so some work for them, and then go away. These guys are regarded as a shared resource. It's been said that there would not be enough work for them if they decided to put the people in the UI/UX team to tribes.  Do you agree with this approach of the ""shared resource""? Any lessons learned from using the same pattern? Or reasons to avoid it?  "
842,"How best to manage a shared pool of testing devices (phones), track who has which device?","Is there an easy way (could be software, but needn't be) to manage a pool of devices as one can a small library? That is, track who has which device, track the status of the devices, when they were signed out, and so on?  A shared spreadsheet requires quite a bit of maintenance and quickly becomes out-of-date, and a paper sign-out sheet is too inconvenient for teams across different floors of the same building.  I've only a dozen or so devices—phones, cables, chargers—used for tests and demonstrations, but would like to be able to see where and with whom they are at any given time, and rely on that information. "
843,Delays in projects - what is normal on IT implementations?,"I have some experience in IT myself, but in a different type of projects, so I would love to pick your brains.  The context is that during conversations with some friends I had the impression that delays are completely normal during IT implementations. My experience of it is a bit different. We had some delays, but they were never more than 20-30% of the time planned for the project.  Now, imagine an IT project (implementation of an online platform). It started in mid-2017. The launch was planned for Jan. 2018.   Then it got delayed. First, just 3 months, then 1 additional month, 1 month... We are approaching Nov. 2018, the launch hasn't taken place yet. (No external, unpredictable factors contributed to the delay).  Is it normal in IT? Of course I understand that ""normal"" is a word that's difficult to define. But I imagine there are a lot of consultants and project managers among you, so you probably experienced some projects and can estimate what happens a lot and what doesn't. What is a typical delay (in %) on an IT-implementation? "
844,I want to transition into Project Management from a very different career,"Recently, I qualified as a solicitor (that's ""lawyer"" for Americans), and decided I would much sooner set myself on fire than continue in that role. I have a law degree, but I have always been maths/IT minded. I also know that while I'm a passable coder, my strengths are in the area of organizing teams and getting stuff done.  What, in your experience, are the things that a hiring manager would consider beneficial when assessing an applicant for a junior IT project management position who comes from a different field and has no direct IT project management expertise? Would Scrum or PRINCE2 certification be helpful? Are there other qualifications that would be sensible to seek out before looking for a project management role? "
845,MS Project 2013 - SubProject Finish Date not Calculating Correctly,"I have a Master Project with a subproject. Inside the subproject there are two tasks. If opened alone and calculated (F9) the subproject finish date will roll up correctly.  If the Master Project is opened and calculated (F9) then it will roll up differently (and incorrectly.)  Why is this the case?  This is the Master Project (with the subproject linked) before calculation. As you can see, after the calculation it should show ID 1 to finish on 8/24/15 being the latest task date.  Before Calculation: [website]After Calculation: [website]As you can see, after the calculation it shows the finish date of the project at 8/8/14 instead of the later date 8/24/15 but shows the correct finish date on the Project Summary task of the Master Project.  What is going on?  Update * Just as an update. We believe it is a problem with the MS Project Pro 2013 updates. If we uninstall all MS Project updates it will calculate as expected. If we open in in MS Project 2016 it will calculate as expected.   This is still a serious calculation problem. "
846,Project budgeting by financial year vs lifetime?,We're discussing how project budgets will be set and tracked. My view is that the budget should be set for the duration and tracked that way. Our finance team have a preference for the budget to be for the financial year with what happens in the next year covered in future financial planning. I can see where our finance colleagues are coming from but have concerns:   if we pro-rata or estimate per financial year:   What happens if we exceed budget this year as we are ahead of schedule (great for project but will cause a finance problem)? What happens if our spend is below budget? How will that work for the next year (carry over unspent amount?  What is the problem for the finance team if we set the budget for the entire project and do not pro-rata it or estimate per year?    Appreciate the guidance here; getting polarized opinions and need to know if there are pragmatic approaches out there that work .... 
847,Scrum approach to Graphic Design office,"I've been recently asked to teach Scrum to a graphic design office. Why? Because they want to turn their services into quick deliverable products, and not lose focus on the current project they're working on. They want discipline, commitment and flexibility. So I thought of Scrum.  I've only read about Scrum so far, I must say. Also, my experience in project management is fairly poor. So I feel a little lost about when and where to apply Scrum procedures to effectively take the best from the framework.  Consider we are 4 graphic designers: Who can be the P.O.? The Master? Should I consider parts of a Branding project (Stationery, Identity, Folder, Website, etc.) as different sprints?   How can scrum be used in a Graphics design office? "
848,"How to create metrics that can't be ""gamed?""","I've seen managers create metrics that worked, and ones that had unintended side-effects. For example, one manager measured his IT team based on how quickly ""help request tickets"" were closed. Service suffered because everyone was closing tickets even before the customer could verify the problem was actually fixed...and often it was not. The metric changed to be based on satisfaction survey data, and suddenly people were staying on the phone for hours with each customer for even the most simple request.  At other companies I've seen managers who had some kind of ESP that let them create metrics that could not be ""gamed,"" had no unintended side-effects, and encouraged the desire behavior.  What's the secret? How can I create metrics that drive behavior to create the desired result? "
849,"Estimation, Targets, and Performance","Assuming that your team does a great job building its estimates and using a probabilistic approach versus a deterministic approach, and finds that the scope of work will take between 12 to 18 months to complete with their most likely estimate around 14 months, is it better to target closer to the 18 months to build in some degree of assurance of meeting it or would it be better to target closer to 14 or even 13 months...and why?  What are the pros and cons to either the seller or buyer?  This is not one of those questions that has a ready answer and probably violates the rules, but I think it is an interesting and relevant topic to PM worth some debate and argument, so I'm asking it anyways.  :)  Addendum:  Notwithstanding an initial risk evaluation, is there value in ""forcing"" a more optimistic target than what one might find comfortable?  Can this be a productive and healthy challenge for the team?  Can this be an effective way to control Parkinson's Law and Student Syndrome?   "
850,How to split or manage a PBI/User Story in multiple sprints for different task types,"We're struggling to break Product Backlog Items (PBIs)/User Stories into Sprint-sized chunks as we have multiple steps that need to be completed in a linear fashion.    Each release goes through several steps:   Development (Dev Environment)  Testing (Test Environment)  Staging Testing (Staging/Pre-Prod Environment) User acceptance testing (UAT) (Staging/Pre-Prod Environment) Deployment to Production   We can generally get the development and testing finished in a Sprint and the UAT gets completed the following Sprint.  It makes sense to have the UAT tasks under the same PBIs that are used for Development and Testing to prevent duplicating the PBI/User Story.  The problem is having PBIs always open for more than one Sprint means that our Sprint backlog becomes too big, hard to manage and difficult to get metrics from.  It also sets a precedent where we start saying Testing can be in a different Sprint to development, etc.    As I understand it we have the following options:   Continue as we are. Create a separate, duplicate PBI for UAT tasks.  The PBI would be copied from the main PBI. Create a general UAT PBI that includes all tasks required for UAT for that release.   Due to other processes which we can't change UAT cannot be in the same Sprint as development and testing.  We currently use Visual Studio Team Services/Azure Dev Ops.  Would would be the best practice for this? Are there any other options that I've missed? "
851,"Creating synopses of existing movies - hire a team, or crowdsource?","To create a movie database website for a regional language industry, I would like to know whats the best way to acquire/build a large collection of movie synopses for my site. Currently I have thought of 2 ways:   Hire a small team of writers who have extensive knowledge on our regional movies and also hopefully contacts with production houses. The drawback would be it will take quite some time to build a considerable list of movies and the data might not be accurate always. Create a community edition wiki portal that would allow masses to contribute, just as Wikipedia. But the drawback is I am not sure how much I can trust the community on the data submitted.     In order to manage this project successfully, I need to know the pros and cons of each approach to document on my Risk register. Which method is likely to be the most cost effective? Which one would be more accurate? How could I mitigate the risks and lower costs of each approach?  "
852,How does sprints in agile differ from spiral model development?,I have learned that an agile application is done by dividing the development process in form of sprints. How the sprints different from spiral model development? Is there an minimal sprint count for a particular project as constraint? 
853,Development solution rushed prior to agreement on requirements - is this a healthy project management?,"I've been working for 4 years in IT field (as Developer and QA Lead) and I've just joined this company on Sept 2018 as System Analyst.   Here are some background of the company and the project we are doing at this moment:   Company has CMMI Level 3 certification. The team are consists of developers who just joined the company 2 months ago, while the PM been working for the company for 8 years. Project initiated 2 months ago. This project has no fundamental concepts / base for demo The team is practicing agile methodology (My first time with agile)   This is what I noticed about current SOP/Workflow of the team:   All user requirements has not been properly documented and signed-off so far. After gathered requirements, the PM instructed developers to code the solution (according to PM's idea/visualization), while the solutions has not been documented yet and discuss with client for confirmation. While solutions are either still in development stage or has been completed for demo, PM send the designed process flow to client for reviews. Client feedback with changes (sometimes minor, sometimes major) and PM requested the team to modify according to feedback within next few hours / days. PM always received call from client, after the call, 90% of the time there will have some changes (modify existing features or add new features) on the system, and sometimes the team need to get it done in next few hours / days. Today the PM discussed this Idea A with me and the developers. I've documented it and send to PM for reviews. After next few days, when we mentioned about Idea A, the PM will questioned why are we using Idea A as it is wrong, and requested us to change to Idea B.   Is this a healthy project management? I've voiced my concerns to the PM that we should have proper documentation (URS, FRS and etc) and sign off to prevent frequent changes of ideas/request and to buy time for developers, but the PM said this client does not bother about it and will not follow the procedures. What should we do to handle these scenarios? "
854,How to estimate story points if team members work on different applications,"Our team consists of 4 full-time developers and occasional outside help. The developers maintain several different applications and do not all share the same skill set. I understand that scrum teams should be cross-functional, but in this case they all do the same general kind of work on the same general family of applications. There is some coupling between the applications, but not enough to make the developers interchangeable or consider the applications as ""tiers"" for the purpose of vertical slicing. The developers are essentially one- or two-man teams who know something about one another's work, but not enough to do it themselves.  How can the team agree on a common baseline or point of reference for estimating story points, when a one-point story on application A might not necessarily be half as big as a two-point story on application B? Should these developers even be considered a single scrum team? "
855,"If risks have been identified in a design document, how are these addressed?","If a design document e.g. software, IT infrastructure, etc details risks, how are these generally addressed as part of the project?  Do these risks also reside with the project?  For example, i have a design document that notes (one of several), that disaster recovery is not in scope. From an operational and business perspective, this introduces a level of risk.  "
856,At what point do assumptions become risk?,"In most documents there is a section on assumptions e.g. We assume that the network is well within the realms of supporting this solution.    At what point does it become a risk? Where does the risk lie e.g. project, operations, business, all?  "

858,Integrating UX into Scrum - how to do usability testing within a sprint?,"I am trying integrate a UX team of about 14 UX designers into a software engineering organization of about 100 developers. One of many challenges I'm trying to figure out is how to deal with things like usability testing.  I'm working off lots of assumptions here (please correct me if these are bad assumptions):   The UX team's work should be in the backlog as user stories.  Point of clarification - right now, there is a design backlog and then there is an engineering backlog.  So we're not ""full stack."" A user story should be able to be completed in one sprint.   So here's my question:    Does it make any sense to write a user story for a usability test?  It doesn't seem user focused.  For example, ""As a user I want the application to be usability tested so that we can identify problems and fix them.""  What?  That's nonsense.  How should we integrate these kinds of tasks into our backlog?  It usually takes 4+ weeks to complete a usability test.  We have to recruit the participants (very narrow demographic), plan the test, run the test, and then report on the test.  Can't get all that done in a 2 week sprint.  What now?  How do I write a story for something smaller than the full usability test?  A story just for writing the test plan, then another story for recruiting the participants?  That really seems to stretch the definition of a user story.  "
859,Is having multiple roles (Tech leader + Programmer + Scrum Master) against Scrum / Agile methodology guidelines?,"I am the co-founder of a software startup (reporting software with a lot of statistics and mathematics). There is a CEO and a ""project manager"" (actually a sales person with no experience in software project management)  I created the software and hired mostly junior programmers.   I'm still de facto the technical leader as I'm very often needed to help with tasks and problem solving, release planning and deployment.  Now I have proposed an Agile course to everybody included managers and started to act as Scrum Master because I want people to take more responsibility and split roles (and because we don't have resources to hire a Scrum Master full time). I hold a Scrum Master certification, but it's my first practical experience.  However I feel like I'm everything... - co-founder (so probably a stakeholder in the Agile methodology) - CTO  - Scrum Master - technical leader - and yes, programmer  Doesn't that clash a little bit with a Scrum/Agile methodology? How should I deal with that (since personal issues from the group will probably arise)? "
860,What alternatives can I find to Kanban for enterprise applications,"We are currently using Kanban to manage customizations and extensions within our application.  Our application is an enterprise application which is highly configurable, however, configure the tool right is quite complicate. The development of our tool have been taken place during several years (about 15), and the code is quite complex. Furthermore, the requirements and specifications from the customers are highly volatiles. They often change substantially before the end of the project. Therefore, we need a flexible (agile) process to adequate these changes into the project.  Our current Kanban board counts with the following status/columns: * Specifying * Specify-Approving * Rejected * Ready for dev/conf * on progress (dev/conf) * Testing * UAT * Done.  In my perspective, our current problem with our implementation of Kanban is that we are not including essential information which should be required stage after stage before being moved from one to other column. E.g Software Specification, Acceptance Criteria, Testing Plan, Release Notes... I see that including these items might increase the complexity of the Kanban process, and this makes me question if Kanban is the right solution that we need.  On the other hand, I feel that our Kanban implementation is not giving use the flexibility that we want. The requirements often change before completion of the project.    Is kanban the right solution for project similar to ours? How can I modify our Kanban process to be more efficient? What alternatives are for Kanban for this kind of projects?  "
861,How to track and manage project progress & opportunities?,"I am trying to manage project progress; what is the best way to track and manage project progress? As the project progresses, how does one recognize, anticipate and track alternative possibilities? "
862,Is it OK to defer implementation detail and consider user story to be done?,"I am just getting into user stories (read some blogs and watched some of Mike Cohn's presentations).  My current understanding is that the story is a vertical slice of the system. Stories are not ""Add database so that customer's data is permanently stored"" or something horizontally similar.    Stories are about ""What"" instead of ""How"".  Now the project/product that I'm working with can be thought as a vending machine. So let's say I have the following story in the project called ""vending machine"":     As a customer,   I want to receive a receipt,   so that I can prove my purchase later.   This story seems to depend strongly on the printer that can physically print a receipt, but let's say that development has been kicked off but hardware hasn't arrived yet.    I can write business logic and GUI, but I cannot integrate with the printer.  However, I can create an implementation that would ""print"" receipt to console output.  Is it ok to extract task out of this story and consider the story to be done? The task would be something like:     ""Create xerox printer implementation for [Printer] interface""   This can potentially mean that all the stories can be completed before hardware arrives, but it leaves us with a bunch of (concrete) tasks.  On the one hand, it feels OK, if Product Owner (or whoever accepts the story) understands and accepts that constraint/compromise.  Yet, it can be said     ""How come you say that you have completed the story, but you cannot demo it?"".   Or:       ""[Hardware arrives]. Well, the hardware is here. Install our software and let's ship it.   -No, we need 2 weeks for integration."".   All in all, it seems to come down communication (second 'C' in the card, conversation, and confirmation) and common understanding (confirmation).    My concern is that I'm new into this and this is a first and so far only idea how to approach this situation and experience shows that following blindly through initial ideas can lead to dark corners.  EDIT: I have accepted @Sarov's answer, but I would like to leave what I have learned from this thread:   Multiple answers and comments brought to my attention that (done) stories should provide value. ""How"" shouldn't matter. @Todd A Jacobs points out that the story can be flawed since the value can be delivered without having an external dependency.  "
863,How do I auto-level a project mid-duration taking into account % complete on tasks?,"I have a MS Project 2007 plan with six months of work in it. I'm updating the % Work Complete on the tasks as we progress through the plan each week and month.   I'm moving the ""Project Start"" date each day I work on the project so that it re-levels the tasks based on the current date and I can tell when my projected release date will be.  What frustrates me is completed tasks remain to the right of my ""Project Start Date"" line. It seems like auto-leveling should move the completed work to the left of the ""Project Start Date"" line, correct? How do I make Project behave like I want?  I could be using MS Project totally wrong. Maybe I need to change my workflow a bit. "
864,Are consultants paid for abandoning project?,"I'm a PhD student and I'm new to Management StackExchange. I'm researching on the kind of contracts that are designed for consultants, and I had a few generic questions about them.   Since there is a distinct discovery phase in most projects, the purpose of which is to determine whether the project is to be abandoned or taken forward, do consultants get paid for recommending that projects be abandoned? Do employers set deadlines for discovery phase?   Any help, references, data would be great.  Thanks "
865,Project Deadlines in an Early State (Scrum Project),"How to deal with early projects states where serious deadline agreements cannot be made yet?   We are in an early stage of the project with new people. The team is small and everything is new (technology and people): In short. A lot of dynamic factors. We are still in the phase were we find out how much we can do in a single sprint A lot of important things are not yet defined in the Backlog (just exist as some vague marketing statements)   At the same time some Stakeholders already want to set deadlines or milestones.   But I would need these two things to seriously agree on something:   Having some more experience in how fast the team performs Backlog with every feature that the Stakeholder wants to define the date or deadline for.  Seriously agree on something would mean for me that between expectation and reality are not factors like two times longer or higher.   My question is how such situations can be handled or should be communicated to Stakeholders (from a Product Owner perspective).  Update Regarding Comment of Jeff: It is very interesting to have these two kinds of aspects: Date-driven and scope-driven. I guess a combination would be best. I mean a date-driven goal would mean, that you make the release at the given date no matter what happens, right? (We are still in the learning process of Scrum methodologies. So I guess hints in the direction of Roadmaps and Scrum help us in general.) "
866,How to optimize for Flow Efficiency over Resource Utilization?,"In researching the 100% Utilization Fallacy, I came across the suggestion to optimize for flow efficiency (making sure the workflow for each individual customer/project/task/what have you is as quick as possible), rather than resource utilization (making sure everyone always has work to do).  However, how does one actually accomplish this? What does one mandate? What does one measure? What does one avoid? "
867,"How do I organize a team of “shadow"" software developers (think ghostwriters)?","I'm starting a software development consultancy -- coders for hire. I'd be the main developer and would hire others to delegate certain tasks to. The catch: I want that my clients should never see who my other workers are, so that they can't start researching their qualifications and decide they're under-qualified, try to poach them if they think they're amazing, or other nasty stuff.  My question: are there any best practices or tips for how to set up my internal systems and workflow to have such ""shadow developers"" that the client never knows the identity of?  Some of the problem areas I have surrounding this:   When the client gives me github access to their projects, should I request the access on a new github username for each client and then share the password to that user with all my employees? This has some major downsides I'd rather avoid: I can't review the code my workers commit before it's ever seen by my client, and I don't know which worker committed which commit. Is there another way? My clients all have their own project management tools. Similarly to the github issue, I can end up looking bad if my worker has free access to collaborate with the client's other devs posing as me, and does/says something embarrassing. Or if two employees use my one account to ask the same question at the same time in different words. The nightmare scenarios can become legendary. On the other hand, maintaining a second project management system internally for my employees and copy+pasting the tickets from the clients' systems into it doesn't sound like a maintainable solution either. Any advice? Bonus question: What is a firm yet reasonable way I can explain to my workers why they need to do everything in their power to remain anonymous?   I feel my Google-fu is above average, but I've searched and searched and it seems I'm the only one on Earth who ever wanted to do this. If there's someone here who's walked this road, please enlighten me.  --- EDIT ---  As Joel points out below, the lack of transparency I'm looking to build into my team seems wrong, so I'll add some background info about my consultancy to clarify why I actually can't have things any other way.  I'll be looking to find those rare exceptional programmers that don't look so good on their resume. The 16 year old who could outcode a Google engineer but doesn't realize it and works for his uncle building websites. The retired sales guy who used to code before the market crash and now is ""too old"" for Silicon Valley. You get the picture.  As you can see, the lack of transparency about who's doing the work is a key competitive advantage of my particular business. Giving it up in the name of the ideals of agile development means finding a new business model. "
868,How to track impediments in SCRUM?,"This has been asked several times already but none of the answers fully convince me.  We are an R&amp;D team doing some support from time to time. Most of the support work can be included in capacity of the team so that the Focus Factor can be set accordingly.  We have one ""batman"" that is on support every week and his/her capacity is lowered so that he/she can focus on customer support.   But sometimes ""batman"" he needs a help from other team member, who is a domain expert and needs to fix some particular issue. If the issue is small then there is no problem but what if the amount of work is substantial?   Should we create a new sprint task and estimate it and remove some other task from the sprint backlog which has a similar size?  Should the story points for completing this task be counted as those of the stories that were taken during the planning meeting? In fact we had to remove some item we committed to deliver it so the amount of work done was lower than expected. Maybe we should we track the time spent on those instead and try to not remove anything from sprint backlog? In this case we don't have to estimate (which might be incorrect especially for harder bugs), just count time that was spent on fixing particular task. The drawback is that using this approach the velocity will be lower and if this is very unusual situation only some sprints will be affected.   What is more, even if I could accept estimating the support bug and counting its size together with other tasks taken into the sprint during planning (after all this is the product improvement), I am not convinced we should do the same with non-development tasks (broken build system that developer needs to fix, access to bug tracker was broken and some developer needs to take a look). In this case should we track bugs and non-development separately and differently?  It's clear for me that repeating issues tracking is much easier but I am particularly interested in the ones that are not happening that often and have a significant impact on the time the development team can spend on delivering sprint tasks. We had an issue with a system build that took 2 man weeks to solve and it has happened only once; then a big part of the sprint tasks were not delivered in that sprint. How to track such a issues so that our velocity measure will be correct? "
869,How to manage agile projects with high staff turnover,"Background: a large consultant company wants to better utilize their consultants time when they're between assignments. The plan is to have an internal concept managing internal projects, which aim to deliver value to the company (sale demos, internal products, etc.) and also give the consultants the opportunity to gain new skills (for example get experience working as a Scrum Master).  Using Scrum for these projects are getting mixed results, since staff leave the projects pretty much immediatly when they get a paying assignment which makes it impossible to get a somewhat consistent velocity.  These circumstances also increase the demand on the ease of which one can enter these projects, for example readability of code, documentation of decision making etc. One risk is that this could increase the waterfall-nature of these projects, which I very much would like to avoid  So how to manage these projects? Project methods to use? Pitfalls to avoid, and how? Any help would be greatly appreciated "

871,reestimating story size after moving back to product backlog,"Let's assume that part of the story (worth say 8 points) was done in the sprint 1.   Then, after implementing part of it we are discovering that in fact it is much bigger than originally estimated. Credit for completing the story was not given in sprint 1 (story was not completed) and it was moved back to product backlog.    Now, should we re-estimate it during the planning for sprint 2?  Should the estimate contain ONLY remaining part of the story (part was already done in sprint 1) or the total size of the story (then implemented part should be reflected in team capacity so that more stories will be taken to the next sprint)?   If we use the later approach what with other stories which are there in the product backlog and were estimated based on the story which was re-estimated (aka the size of this next story was similar to the one that was re-estimated and that's why next story has some particular size). Should we change estimates of all such a stories as well? This seem to be quite a big overhead.  If we use the first one then we know straight from the beginning that our velocity current sprint (sprint 2) will be much lower than usual as the story is having inaccurate estimate (and we already know it during the planning).  What should be the best approach here?  To clarify what I mean by re-estimating.  I don't want to move only part of the work which was not done to the next sprint, but in fact we've figured out that our original estimate was wrong. Should we so to say change the estimate to 21 instead of 8 and agree that half was done in sprint 1 and we will have to spent time needed to develop remaining 10-11 story points in the next sprint (sprint 2)?

876,Is a project without defined completion criteria really a project?,"A general direction has been set, a team of people assembled, they know what their first deliverables are, and they are off and running. They don't know what the end deliverable will look like, nor do they have a set of satisfaction criteria. Neither they nor their customers can say how long the work will last, and drip-feed development could go on for ever. They describe themselves as a project team, but are they really? And is their manager a project manager? Prince2 would suggest not, and I suspect that PMBOK would agree, but it is not an uncommon situation. If this is not a project, what is it? "
877,Managing multiple agile projects in a small software house,"Background  I'm a junior project manager in a small software house with not much experience on our market. My aim is to organise work teams work in most efficient way, work out sustainable processes, boost team productivity and prepare our company for scaling up. I would like to discuss the situation with you guys to find out about your points of view and maybe figure out a solution to problems with which we struggle.  Description of company:   Small software house, developing websites and mobile apps  Team:    5 developers (fullstack, so involved in mobile and websites projects) PM   UI/UX Designer  Tools:  Confluence for wiki and files storage JIRA for task management &amp; timetracking    We are busy with:   Development for new customers Ongoing development for existing      customers  Ongoing maintenance for developed solutions   Project management:   Each project for every customer is organised into its own separate project on JIRA, with its own scrum Board, own backlog etc. If we develop a mobile app, a web app and a website for one customer, that means we have 3 ongoing JIRA projects, 3 scrum boards etc. We have 30-min weekly standup sessions with the entire team to share our work progress and to update each other on what's going to happen next. We also meet up at 5pm everyday for a quick summary of what we managed to do and what we are planning to do tomorrow and then we call it a day. Almost all developers are assigned to all projects (with different capacity). We have also few small projects with only one developer assigned. After each sprint there is a retrospective session organised during which we go through the work done and try to make it better next time.   Problems we face   We have many scrum boards, but we don't have a main one. It's not clear for developers, who is working on what etc. To make myself clear, I assign tasks to them in JIRA. I myself lose the big picture from time to time managing so many boards and projects. It's not clear for each developer, what he should do next after completing a task. A lot of delays because of emerging, unexpected tasks from maintenance part. It's not an unusual situation to drop the current work and go fight the fire with everyone we got on deck.   Questions:   How does one manage scrum projects in a situation, where you have all the team involved in every project? Is there a way to have one main scrum board? Is it a good approach? Or there is other better way? Our customers have access to their projects on our JIRA to be able to track progress on scrum boards. What are your thoughts on this approach? Do you have maybe some good tips/tricks? From my point of view it is crystal clear how to use agile and scrum for one project and one team, but it's getting nasty when you have a lot to do with very limited human resources.  "
878,How to solve the problem of assets being so 'digitally dispersed' across many platforms,"Scenario  A few years ago, I managed to (pretty much) cut out any paper work from my life and all my work is digital now. I work as a contractor web developer and have several projects on the go at once. I usually work remotely for clients in London whilst travelling around the world. In order to do this more efficiently, I need to continue working to streamline my project management systems.    Structure  I have usually tried structuring files/tasks related to projects by priority, and by whether the asset still needs to change in any way (e.g. being ticked off on a todo list), or if it no longer needs to 'change' in which case it is 'filed' away.  I have usually used a system of 3 for this, e.g.:   Top: needs to be done asap Med: something that can wait for now Low: something which can be filed away   I feel like this works pretty well for me, as it is often easier for one to think in 3s.  However, the challenge I always face is the one presented by how dispersed digitally everything is these days.    In the past  In the 'olden days' (before computers) I might have had one (physical) project folder for each of the projects I was working on. Using the same way of thinking, I could potentially use a system like this:   Top: work is kept outside any physical project folder because it needs to be right there in front of me on my 'desktop' because it is urgent. Med: work that needs to be done for the project, but isn't so urgent and can be 'out of sight', maybe slotted into a project folder at the front. Low: Information about the project which can now be filed away in the relevant project folder.     Now  Nowadays, a project seems to looks more like this:   Top: Priority tasks in Google Tasks, priority project tasks in Asana/JIRA highlighted with a tag or something, priority browser 'tabs' on my bookmarks bar, priority emails starred in my inbox, priority files on my desktop, priority notes in a 'main' section in onenote. Med: Medium project tasks in a backlog in Asana/JIRA, medium tasks in Google tasks before being moved to Asana (easy to add on the go and offline on my phone), medium priority emails in a project related folder in my inbox, medium priority files in project folders on my desktop (aliases to them actually), medium priority browser tabs in project bookmark folders. Medium priority 'notes' somewhere I just don't know anymore with them. Low: Notes filed away in onenote, files filed away in project folders, browser bookmarks filed away in project folders.   This drives me mad and sometimes I lose concentration and focus because my brain just cant decide where it needs to 'look' next. It is almost like there is no 'centralised' place to look for the priorities for each project. And no good overall management system for managing how much resource should be applied to each project and in what priority.    Questions   Is there a flaw in my thinking and structuring here, or do other people have this problem too?  Am I just 'digitally hoarding' and trying to micromanage too much?  Am I trying to squeeze everything into one system which just doesn't work (the 3 rule)?  Does anyone have any groundbreaking suggestions or good tool recommendations? Why hasn't someone designed the 'perfect project management tool' yet (this is a joke question because I know this will look different depending on the organisation (or maybe there is a 'core' system which would work for any organisation that could have various plugins bolted in?))   I find that good separation allows me to focus a lot better, e.g. I have a separate login for my personal stuff and a separate login for my work stuff, which is so so helpful for my concentration, and I would love to be able to open one 'view' and see everything needed for a selected project right in front of my at once (or at least the 'top' priorities).  By the way, I love that there is a project management Stack Exchange site! "
879,Time Logs for Project Manager,"I am a solutions architect working for a private company. The company would like to associate employees' time logs with their payroll. For instances, if an employee is supposed to deliver 8 hours of work in a day and the employee is logging only 7 hours, then he/she would not be fully paid.  I personally feel it's a blizzard decision of management.  Anyways, my role is solutions architect but I also put on multiple hats: Project Management, Hiring Team, Hands on Development, R&amp;D, Production Support and more.  How do I maintain my Time Sheet? Most of my time will be discussing with team members, attending meetings with stakeholders, interviewing candidates doing R&amp;D on few development challenges, Code-Reviewing and Hands-on-development (it's easy to log hours here).  Any suggestions would be greatly helpful.  FYI: We are already using Azure DevOps (Scrum) for Project Management, but I am not sure how I can come up with my tasks because I will be involved in all tasks of my team members' and more. If I have 6 people in my team and each member is having around 15 tasks in a Sprint, that will be 6*15 = 90 tasks for me. Does it sound right to maintain such a task list for capturing hours? "
880,Tips for Selecting an Existing Employee to Be a Project Manager,"Projects are defined as being temporary.  As a result, this means that unless more projects will follow, a project manager could be any employee with the necessary skillset who is selected to see the project to it's completion and then return to his or her previous duties.  The goal would be to organize the sales/service process, increase sales volume, and build enough volume to keep a 3 person team busy.  The project would be a success if 3 sales associates are actively talking to 10 leads per week and are able to either self-manage without the project manager or are managed by a designated member of the 3 person team.  If you needed to select a project manager to take on the details of putting together a sales department and customer service department to sell a product you're developing and provide customer support for that product, how would you select this person?  What specific criteria or skills would you look for in this person? "
881,Story breakdown and parent story points,"An issue has come up lately as we break down stories.. The scenario is as follows: During product increment planning we outline X amount of stories for the PI. This is recorded in Jira with story points associated to each story. As we go into sprint planning we often find the the original stories may be to broad, or may not not fill a business requirement.  So two question:  Granted its a tooling problem, but is it the norm to link the new stories back to the original? If the original story had say 20 story points and the sub story has 10, would you reduce 10 from the original story to avoid double counting? "
882,Is there a good model for choosing an agile approach?,"I'm a project manager in an extremely bureaucratic, waterfall-oriented organization, but have the opportunity to pilot an agile approach with a new project I'm spinning up.  I have experience with scrum and kanban, but intend to take a comprehensive look at the major agile methodologies and determine the best fit for the project and organization.   Is there a good model or tool to help determine the appropriate agile methodology for the situation?  In the absence of a good model, what do you believe are the key criteria for choosing a specific agile methodology? And if you want to really want to go overboard, what weight (as a percentage of total) would you apply to your criteria?  Robert Wysocki's book suggests some broad approaches based on whether or not the project goal is clear, requirements are complete, schedule is tight and whether scope changes are expected. But there may be other resources out there worth reviewing. "
883,Agile Release Planning,"Let's say my team's velocity is 50 and for the next release, we need to complete a 500 worth of user story points. My sprint length is 2 weeks. So if I divided 500 by 50 I need to spend 10 sprints to complete the work (entire scope).  But the stakeholders are asking to complete the same scope (500 worth of user story) before that timeline.  What kind of steps can one take to overcome this situation?? "
884,PM communication model,"In our search for a zero-email SE/BIM solution, we’re struggling to strip communication ‘terms’ to their essence. In PM-jargon, we tend to use many terms, such as; Decision - Action - Task - Note - Question - Change request - Change order - Issue - Remark - Comment - Approval - Assumption - Item - …  What is the minimum set of 'terms' to manage all types of communication? It's about more than just semantics.  Imagine you want to set up a database application to totally replace the need for e-mail, for all communication needs in a project. It has to be role-based, traceable and water-tight.  So what do we use e-mail for in projects? To inform, to question, to give a task, to implement a decision, to flag an issue, to request or order a change, to give feedback, to .... etc. etc. How could we reduce this to a minimal set of 'types of communication' - for the lack of a better expression - so that we can build a database-based e-mail replacement? With the obvious benefit that all communication is always explicit, structured, related, logged, traceable, ... instead of my Inbox, which is a Black Hole?   For instance:   a Note (or Remark or Comment) is a message (a piece of information), from a Sender (a person/role or a 'meeting') to a Receiver (one or more person(s)/role(s) or a meeting). It does not require a response. So the only data fields required are: Message (= the note) - Sender - Receiver. a Question (or Request for Information or Issue??) is a message from a Sender to a Receiver (same definitions as above). It DOES require a response, by a certain time. So the required data fields now are: Message (= the question) - Sender - Receiver - Due date. The Answer will be linked to this Question, so that it is traceable. a Decision is a message (a piece of information), from a Sender to a Receiver (same definitions as above). It does not require a response as such, but it should lead to the mutation of a Requirement (Delete, Change or Create). If not, it is just a Note. So the required data fields now are: Message (= the decision) - Sender - Receiver - Requirement(s) affected. The Decision will remain linked to the affected Decision, so that it is traceable. and so on ...    My question now is: how many 'terms' are required to cater for all types of 'information exchanges' in a role-based PM-system, if the objective is to make the use of e-mail obsolete? And what is the smallest set, to keep this as simple as possible?   Does some kind of 'information exchange model' (i.e communication model) exist? "
885,"Customer asks for a contract with the price for the whole project, but we are Agile","We have a client to whom we have explained the whole Agile process, where he pays for each sprint (as billing cycles), and he agreed to it.   We are a new company and we don't really have a legal advisor. That being said, we are charging 50% of the billing cycle at the start, and 50% at the end; and the customer made the first payment before signing the contract. (The project has about 4 billing cycles so far).  Today we sent the contract for the first cycle, but the customer asked us to send a contract for the whole project. Since we are doing Agile development, we charge per cycle, meaning that each cycle's price might change depending on requirements, therefore there is no such thing as a ""total price"", but only estimations.  How do we [re]explain this to the customer?   PS: Yes, clearly we were not clear enough when explaining this the first time, so we want to re-explain it without sounding like we never told this about.  Considering the fact that he knows he payed just for the first cycle, how do we explain that others cycles are just an estimate? (The document describing each cycle had a disclosure that says: ""Changes in requirement might cause price changes"") "
886,Going from project manager to scrum master (career progression),"I currently work at a large IT consulting firm as an agile project manager. I am PMI-PMP, ACP certified and have 3-4 yrs of scrum/xp experience of which 2 years as a scrum master. I am contemplating a job offer for the role of Iteration manager / Scrum Master with a large e-commerce retailer. The big plus for me is to get ecommerce experience exp in large scalable systems.  The scrum master/IM role (Typically and in this case) does not have stakeholder management responsibilities, staffing, people management, risk management and P&amp;L responsibilities - all of these I currently do in my role and I know is high demand for PM jobs. I do not want to make a career out of scrum-mastering or becoming an agile coach. My aspiration is to grow to program manager or business development roles and consider this opportunity to gain some e-Com experience.  I would like to know    How do recruiters &amp; hiring managers view this transition from PM to SM - will this transition hurt me if I want to shift back to Proj / program mgmt roles after gaining e-commerce experience ? Does the actual job title matter (Project Manager vs Scrum Master) when looking for new jobs in the PM space ?    I am trying to ascertain if taking up the Iteration manager for the benefits it offers (e-commerce experience) will hurt my chances of progressing along the project/program manager track (which I am currently on)   Feedback will be much appreciated from Recruiters/Hiring Managers/Fellow PMs/Scrum Masters. "
887,Do user stories mean rework? How much is ok?,"We are currently setting up a scrum team to implement a product selling application. The product itself is quite complex (an insurance product) which comes in many facets, basically some mandatory and a lot of additional, optional components.  So we have a lot of business rules that ensure that  a) the only valid combinations of components are provided to the customer (Product rules) and  b) all required inputs are clearly shown and only valid inputs are accepted (other Business Rules and Validation Rules).  The rules depend on the components of the product, customer specifics (age, income, health status, job, etc.) and so on.  Without Scrum, we proceeded as follows:  1) sketch the UIs with the client's expert: ""customer"", ""offer"" (which must be capable to show all product variants) //  ... to find out the UI-Design and the data model, i.e. the required attributes for all product's variants  2) get all the rules based on the before defined model for all product variants from an expert   3) implement the UIs and the rules.  As quality checks in step 3) we had typically: UIs without any function, UIs with increasing amounts of rules implemented.  Ok, now we are going to use Scrum for the first time.  Next week will be the first Sprint Planning Meeting and I know the user stories are like  a) As the client sales manager I want to sell the easiest top-selling variant X from our product in the application to get much money fast.  b) As the client sales manager I want to sell the 2nd best selling variant Y from our product in the application to get a lot money fast.  c) ... guess, but we will have 10-20 of those stories and they have maximum priority.  The point is: I have no problem with this kind of user stories. They are valid slices from the users' points of view. From some point of view they are also independent.  But I fear and expect a lot of rework when we implement these stories sequentially in several sprints:  In story n+1 we have to extend UI from story n, extend and modify the rules from story n.  I looks like we have just add a feature, but what we really have to do is to extend and modify the previous product version, i.e. you actually also have to modify a lot of existing rules to integrate the new stories' features.  I feel something is wrong when user stories seem to produce so much rework!  Added 2017, Jan 20th -- after reading the first anwsers Ok, I think, I understand what you all mean. I am not sure, but eventually my question was a little misleading. So let me ask a little different: Assume I have a backlog for a new product with 4 fat epics, each with say 10 User Stories. The Product Owner prioritised the epics 1, 2, and 3 for releaes in this year, epic 4 for next year. You know can go with application design A for epic 1, 2, 3, but you need another design B, if you also want to integrate epic 4. And you know refactoring from design A to design B is more expensive than starting with design B, which is a little more expensive than A. What would be the best Scrum approach here? Should there be something like a special Sprint for architecure/ design at the beginning (and from time to time again)?  "
888,Agile user story's task estimation,"I have some confusion regarding the concept of a user story's task's estimation (effort estimate) using hours. What is the actual purpose of estimating effort in hours?   In addition to that, let's say my team's velocity is 50 story points and our Sprint duration is 2 weeks. In the Sprint Planning meeting, we have pulled 50 points' worth of user stories to the Sprint Backlog. Then we started to break user stories into tasks and estimate the effort using hours. Then we have noted that the total hours of all tasks (for all the user stories) is 2.5 weeks. In this situation, the task estimate (effort estimate) is conflicting with velocity. So how do we overcome this? "
889,Applying management to project in continuesly development,"Company background:  We are a company that consists of five developers, a sales department an HR and a communication department. (this question will only focus on the development department).  We have build our system (and is still building) using Angular which means that the system is Web based. Right now we ""pretend"" to use scrum however there are a lot of steps that i as Head of the department is still unsure how to tackle.  The issue  Right now our development plan for the year has been set. This consists of alot of smaller projects that has to be done from Q3 of 2015 and until end of 2016. As of now each Developer is tasked with one assignment and two developers at a time would rarely work on the same project (which I see as a problem).   Im finding it hard to divide each project into groups and thereby allowing two or more of my developers to work on the same project without overlapping. It seems to me that web development is more or less a straight line of steps  that has to be done until the project is complete and goes into the testing phase.  I feel that this kinda negates my idea of a Scrum team which in my mind should be a team working on the same projects.   My question is how do you guys work on a single web development project that is being split into many different tasks? Should I continue handing out assignments to each individual developer or is a collaboration on the smaller projects necessary to encourage a sense of team spirit? "
890,EQ/EO determination from a functional point sizing perspective,I am new to function point(FP) estimation. I am considering the following cases would be considered as External Inquery(EQ)/ External Output(EO) in function point sizing perspective. Please correct me if I am wrong.   Lookup of hard coded country code in a master data entry screen. Master data information maintained by a system lookup of a language code information that is hard coded in the application   Any notification/error message comes out of a system would be considered as External Input(EI) only because EI is maintains round trip in nature (batch job may be the exception) and the notification/error message is a part of the round trip. Is my understanding correct?  For Non functional requirement estimation can we use FP technique or Use case estimation technique? 
891,How to measure customer satisfaction in Scrum?,"We use Scrum and we make software products for other companies (I guess it's called B2B).  So, first subquestion: Who should be satisfied by the Development Team: the Product Owner or the Stakeholders? I believe both. But I think, that the main goal of the Development Team is to make the Product Owner happy as the single entry point of requirements and the ""aggregator"" of all other Stakeholders.  And this is the root of my question: all thought of the Product Owner will be subjective. Different Product Owners means different psychotypes. One of them may be generous with praise and be glad for any positive changes in the product. Others may always be dissatisfied. And if the Development Team produces a great increment he will only be a little less dissatisfied, than usual.  As Scrum Master I want to assess the level of customer satisfaction after each increment and search for a way to increase it. But how can we make an objective assessment of customer satisfaction  So:   Is asking the Product Owner's opinion enough? Or, maybe it's a good idea to suggest that the Product Owner get formal feedback (like surveys) from other stakeholders? Or maybe there are more formal methods for measuring such an abstract entity as customer satisfaction? Finally, maybe it's better to not use this subjective measurement at all?  "
892,How to write a summary for a user story?,"I'm working hard on user stories and it is paying off, but something itches.    We use Jira, but the problem is that from above the backlog seems clumsy. We need to write summary for user story so that Jira can display it, but those summaries are sometimes little bit misleading or not helpful to find some particular story.  We don't do scrum, we just use backlog and modified kanban board to visualize our progress.  I would like backlog (and the board) to display stories in (readably) coherent structure so that I can navigate more easily.    At this moment to solve that problem I see that I either:   Find a way to establish some consistency in summaries. Find a way to display (visualize) user story in a backlog in other way.   I don't know how to go about point 2.  Some ideas for point 1 so far:     Use ""I want ..."" as a summary.  Use the story in summary field, but that would beat the purpose of a summary.  Accept that it cannot be done.   More I think about it, I think that user story doesn't have a summary(?). They originated from index cards(?) and represent a small slice of a requirement.  They seems to be as brief as you can get.  Some example stories (please be gentle if they have flaws) in the context of vending machine or pay station that offers card payment option.     As a customer,   I want to be reminded that my card is in card terminal after I have cancelled card payment,   so that I wouldn't forget it to pay station.      As a customer,   I want to be reminded that my card is in card terminal after I have paid by card,   so that I wouldn't forget it to pay station.        As a customer,   I want to know if I have successfully cancelled card payment from card terminal,   so that I wouldn't be confused whether I have paid or not.  "

894,How to set properly aligned KPIs for engineers and QA staff,"Intro  I like to setup KPIs for my engineering/QA teams. I use that to evaluate performance and help determine bonus/raise each quarter.   This is one KPI I set for my engineers:   % of tasks that passed QA with no bugs    ie depending on the QA flow (per issue or per sprint), we see how many bugs were reported against all the issues that were completed by 1. the engineer that fixed the issue 2. the other engineer that peer reviewed it.    ie in a given sprint engineer X resolved 20 issues, which got reviewed by engineer Y. Assuming the QA does their work on a sprint basis, and that the QA found 5 bugs in those 20 issues, the tasks that passed QA with no bugs percentage is 75%   % of tasks that functioned properly post deployment  Same idea as above, but this one will be treated for code that actually gets released live and is used by users    This is one KPI I have for my QA staff:   number of bugs found per issue   ie the more bugs a QA person finds in an issue the better.     Problem  The KPIs for the engineers and QA personnel seem contradictory, or said another way: they seem like a zero sum game. Which obviously isn't good for employee morale and would cause rivalry/resentment.   How can I change this so that both engineers and QA staff have KPIs that make them work together as opposed to against each other?    update: a concrete case  this is in response to novigt's answer below as well as in reference to this comment on a related post:      Are the testers involved before a build? Meaning are they involved in   developing the requirements or use cases or user stories, reviewing   design documentation, or participating in code reviews?..   I figured that proper and sound documentation of scenarios is a huge part of evaluating QA personnel (keep in mind here I'm talking about non-technical QA who simply do black box testing and cannot do automated tests etc).   I agree that a metric that calculates total number of bugs is bogus, and i agree with the incidents in production metric.   Let me explain my new metric with an example:    Suppose I have a single login screen (forgot password/remember me etc not included for brevity) that I would like to build and deploy. Using Gherkin Syntax the QA engineer writes the following scenarios:   Scenario 1: Happy path login given user enters correct username/pwd when user clicks on login then user should be directed to dashboard    Scenario 2: login failure given user enters false username/pwd when user clicks on login then error message shows: incorrect username/pwd    this documentation is given to the engineers (along with the designs) on sprint one , who develop it, peer review it, send it back to QA for testing and then is deployed in version 0.0.01 of the app.   Once on prod, the following bug happens  given user enters correct username/pwd and the server is down when user clicks on login then expected user should get an error message: service is currently unavailable actual a spinner spins for ever    Here are the KPIs/metrics we capture for this scenario:   number of scenarios: 2 number of incidents in production: 1     metrics as a snapshot don't give the whole picture, so let's go on:  so on sprint two, the QA staff updates the documentation with scenario 3:  scenario 3: handle login when server is down given user enters correct username/pwd and the server is down when user clicks on login then user should get an error message: service is currently unavailable     the engineers fix that bug, and deploy it on release 0.0.02, on the release this bug happens:  given user enters correct username/pwd and the user is not connected to the internet when user clicks on login then expected user should get an error message: user is offline actual a spinner spins for ever    Here are the KPIs/metrics we capture for this scenario:   number of scenarios: 3 number of incidents in production: 1 rate of increase of scenarios: 33% rate of decrease of incidents in production: 0%     so we use the last two KPIs (increase in scenarios and decrease of incidents in production) together to evaluate the performance of a QA person. The final evaluation should use both KPIs (in addition to other metrics that can be discussed elsewhere) to evaluate an engineer. This way increasing useless case scenarios alone won't be positive alone, and also an increase in incidents in production without a corresponding increase in scenarios should be a red flag for the engineer. I know one can also achieve this by having comprehensive unit tests that have >95% code coverage etc.. but let's assume we're not there yet.   Is there a problem with this? "
895,Unable to determine the actor in UCP estimation for a given scenario,I have just started using Use Case Points recently. Apparently it looks simple to use but there are certain scenarios where it is difficult to figure out the right transaction count or actor count.   I am facing similar problem where a batch job is trigger internally. Then who is going to be the actor in this case? The user group from which is batch job is triggered or the batch job scheduler. I think the batch job itself can not be the actor here because for any transaction some actor must be there right? Your opinion would really help me to understand the matter in depth 
896,Can scrum master interrupt team member during daily Scrum?,"We are a small team using Daily Scrum meetings to track progress of our mobile app development work. The developers are of varying experience range from 2+ years up to 9 years, and with different technical backgrounds like Android, Java, API Development etc.  As per  Agile/Scrum recommendations, the Daily Scrum meetings should be completed in 15-min. Although we as a team are aware of this, and also the Team is aware that they should tell only 3 things during daily scrum  1. what I did Yesterday, 2. what i will do today and 3. tell impediments if any,  but since the team is still new to Scrum, while telling their daily status, some of the team members also discuss/tell about  1. how they fixed an issue,  2. how they found new requirement adds more value to business etc.  This results in the Daily Scrum meeting going beyond 15-min. almost daily.   My Query: Is it the responsibility of the Scrum master to intervene and interrupt a team member when he/she starts telling about points beyond those 3 that I mentioned? Is this OK as per Agile? "
897,Development buffers and risk factors,"How do you plan on risks when working on the project detailed plan? I assume you add to the plan vacation days for each resource (even though they may not have requested leave at this point), you plan sick leave days, time for meetings attendance and most probably 6.5 or 7 hours effective working time per day.    Do you also add in buffer time for development in case the effort required is underestimated by the developers? If yes, isn't that too risky in a sense that it may delay the project deadline unnecessarily? "

I am using it the following way:  1) RISKS - I specify all potential project risks in the risks tab in excel 2) ISSUES - if that RISK turns into an issue, I then log it, in the issues tab in excel.  Questions:  1) When do I mark the status of the risk and issue closed? Do I do this when the issue has been marked as closed?  Do I mark the issue as closed, if we have put a temporary solution to solve the problem but at a later date need to fix it properly  2) Is it good practice to have risks and issues in one tab, all templates I have seen they separate it.

900,Critical Path Analysis,"I'm currently looking at a past paper question regarding CPA. The question concerns the following subtasks.     The subtasks are denoted A, B, C, D, E, F, G, and H.      Subtask B cannot start until subtasks A and C have been completed.      Subtask C cannot start until subtask A has been completed.      Subtask D cannot start until subtask B has been completed.      Subtask E cannot start until subtask B has been completed.      Subtask F cannot start until subtasks D &amp; E have been completed.      Subtask G cannot start until subtasks F &amp; H have been completed.      Subtask H cannot start until subtasks A &amp; C have been completed.   My question concerns A, B, C and H.  C cannot start until A is completed. B cannot start until A and C are completed. Why does it say it has to wait for A and C to be completed? Likewise with subtask H?  C can only be started when A has been completed - why doesn't it just say it has to wait for C? Is there another layer of complication here? Surely the completion of C implies the completion of A?  The first part of the question is to draw the diagram of the above sub tasks. "

902,Where do requirements end and design begin?,"I imagine this question has been asked in various forms previously but I couldn't locate a specific answer after searching around.    I am currently working in an independent oversight role on an outsourced software development project.  The team and vendor are currently working through the functional requirements specification and trying to elaborate and clarify the requirements.  As I sit in these meetings, I am noticing that the discussions very easily fall into what sounds like ""solutioning.""  In other words, people are starting to draft the requirements in such a way that presupposes a correct solution to the business problem.  My question is, when are these discussions appropriate?  As a business analyst I am naturally inclined to avoid jumping to conclusions about the solution until design begins and the needs are fully flushed out but is any of this appropriate towards the latter end of writing the functional requirements?  This has always been somewhat of a gray area for me.  Any help would be appreciated, thanks! "

904,"When making technically minor changes, should i create a new user story or update an existing (closed) story?","I am working with a team that is maintaining case management software. We are suffering from drift between different specifications, agile artefacts, implementations and understandings. I would like to propose a solution to the team that aligns with agile methodologies that works for our team.  Frequently, we will get a request to ""show additional data X about entity Y on screen Z"", where X may be an existing or new field/property, and Y and Z are almost always an existing entities / screens.  There would have already been a user story that has long been closed: As a user ... I want to see information ABC about entity Y so that I can ..., which would have been used to create the screen in the first place.  Typically field X would just be another piece of information that is not important in itself, but is important when in the context of entity Y. I would find it hard to justify having a story purely to see field X, and other stories typically look at collections of data, not single datums.  Should I:   Create a new story As ... I want to see X about Y so that I can ... - this keeps closed stories closed, and means smaller, more incremental stories, but also means that the old story is no longer current, so I can't treat it as part of the documentation. Re-open the old story and update the acceptance criteria As ... I want to see ABCX about Y so that I can ..., and then create a task Add field Y to Z - this means that stories, tasks (and other artefacts) are all up to date. Typically, the Some other solution? Perhaps use a feature/epic/whatever to track screen Z, and keep that up to date with all the fields about entities that screen Z would display, and then use method 1 and reference the feature? Something completely different?  "
905,User documentation and technical writer in Scrum,"If User documentation is part of the definition of done and there is no technical writer in the scrum team, how the situation is dealt?  Should the dev team create user documentation still  or   wait for the technical writer to be on the scrum team and let them take care of it  or   form a separate team of tech writers  or   let it be undone until the last development sprint? "
906,what is resources in gantt chart for IT project,I want to schedule tasks using the Gantt chart. The project is developing a Web application. I was stuck in the selection of resources for each task; knowing the developer for these tasks is only one person.   What is the semantics of a resource in GANTT?  Are there other types of resources than human resources? 
907,Scenario based Use case point estimation counting,"I am new to use case base estimation technique. I have the following scenario and facing little difficult to conclude my use case point count. Suppose I need to execute 3 steps one after another. Each of these steps, by themselves does not leave the system in a consistent state. So from use case point counting should I consider 1 use case having 3 transactions? Is my understanding correct?  Also for use case estimation along with functional document, I must require design document right? Without design document, I can still estimate with functional document but it will not be accurate right? "
908,How to handle real world sprint failures?,"Example: I have a project where I want to import raw data into a new database.  sprint 1: clean up/validate raw data  sprint 2: import raw data to new database  If sprint 1 fails, what is the SCRUM methodology to stop and redo sprint 1, or introduce a new high priority sprint 1.5, before proceeding to sprint 2?  If I truly believed there was no such thing as failure, I would simply import the unusable data, record lessons learned, delete the data and start over? "
909,How to track large number of similar projects and tasks?,"I work in a university unit helping develop online courses. Upper administration wants a way of reporting these out there and how long our people are working on things. Each semester we are tasked with development of around a total of 20 new &amp; updating old courses. Attempting to look for a system/methodology to track these - including time, tasks, emails, etc. We have a staff of around 30 people organized into 4 teams that each take a subset of courses each term. Then on top of those 20 new courses we have ongoing support for the courses after they are developed that should be tracked as well.  The problem that keeps coming up is that the number is far too large for most PM systems to handle at one time it seems like. We tried products like Microsoft Project, Jira, Asana, Trello, Zoho and others but the volume of what would be considered ""tasks"" (e.g. ""get course syllabus"", ""input quiz 1"") ends up quickly exceeding the limits of each system. The structure most commonly used in the past has been:  Project = Course Development +---Main Task = Develop Course ABC 101     +---Subtask = Course Task Project = Course Support +---Main Task = Support Course ABC 101     +---Subtask = Support Task   We did try creating each course as a project but in most system this doesn't take too well. Microsoft Project seems to require separate files, web based ones are slow to handle that many projects or organizing like tasks is near impossible. Thought of trying to label things as college, department, etc. as projects, but not sure if that would alleviate much.   Would it be common to lump course developments as one large project? Or is there some way to break it down into smaller to handle areas? any ideas or possible past practices would be appreciated. "
910,How does the TFS 2012 burndown work for tasks created and worked on in the same day?,"It appears that the TFS 2012 burndown works a bit differently than I expect.  Suppose my current iteration is at 100 hours remaining out of 200 total original estimate, and my three team members each create a task today, estimate each at 6 hours, and complete these tasks.  Thus, we discovered and completed 18 hours of work that we didn't realize were there.  I would expect the entire burndown to ""shift up"", have it recalculate based on 218 hours total, and we would now be at 100.  Thus we would show a good burn for today: we burned down 18 hours, going from 118 to 100, remaining.  The goal burndown line would get a bit steeper, and we would reevaluate if it is realistic given the newly discovered work.  However, it seems that TFS's burndown chart ignores the ""original estimate"" in some (all?) cases and would show no progress today; those 18 hours are not reflected anywhere in the burndown.    This doesn't quite make sense to me--the upshot is, if I create a task today and finish it today, no hours are burned; but, if I create a task today, work on it today, and finish it tomorrow, then some but not all of its hours burn. Really?  How best to deal with this situation? Do we need to change the way we think of this? "
911,TFS Work Item Customization for Deliverable Tracking,"I am looking for a bit of guidance on the best practices for using TFS as a work management system in a time-bound implementation project. Let us assume we begin with the Scrum workflow and our project is following a hybrid Scrum/Waterfall model (for a moment, ignore the controversy that statement may create). Assume that you have full rights to customize the TFS project area as you please and that all features in TFS 2015 product suite are available.  The scrum workflow has work items and PBIs and familiar concepts for code deliverable creation and defect management. The first assumption I would like to vet is that these work items are most appropriate for code creation and deployment. This may be a bad assumption given that Task for example is fairly abstract, so please correct me if this is wrong.  Let us then assume that in addition to the software product there are a number of other deliverables which must be produced for the project to be a success, but that these deliverables are not deployable as part of the software:   Design Documentation Standards Documentation 'Change Requests' Socialized ""Key Decisions"" which may dictate design patterns and strategies   Each having its own logical set of steps to progress towards its own definition of done (reviews, signoffs etc).  When is it appropriate to put items like this into TFS as a custom work item definition and what are the trade offs? Ordinarily these may be handled as line items in a MS Project plan. Naively, I am interested in putting these into TFS instead of MS Project because then TFS work items can be the single source of truth for deliverable progress, instead of having to keep a project plan in sync with TFS or vice versa.  Can someone with experience customizing TFS weigh in on the pros and cons of using TFS for managing deliverable tracking when the deliverables are not coded deployables, and creating custom work items for those deliverable types? "
912,How to get people on board with Scrum/agile?,"So I'm part of a Team with 12 members in which we have recently tried to adopt Scrum/agile processes. I am the Scrum Master of the Team and I am also very new to agile; I'm also an apprentice within the company so the rest of the Team and I are not very familiar with the process.  First of all, I apologize if there are more questions in here than just the title!  So my main issue is that we are a Team that perform a large number of operational roles within our day; we are a Development Team, however we don't get a lot of time for development. Within our Team, we have about 5 development members, 2 main managers, subject matter experts and then also people involved with demand. Our manager wanted us to include everything we do whether it was development or not, however we eventually agreed to just stick to development.  My main issue is that the non-developers really don't want to get on board with the agile process. We are on our 8th Sprint so 16 weeks of agile and even before it began they barely turn up to meetings, report new stories for the board or come to me for any support. How do I get people on board that are so against the process? They have no motivation to complete what's on the board so we are constantly rolling tasks over onto the next Sprint which drags the whole process down and they don't want to help make the process better. The development members are so keen for the process to work, they work well with the tasks, attend all meetings yet it's others that bring the process down it seems.  Another issue that I have is that could we even be running agile as a team due to the fact that we get little time to focus on development? We have so many operational tasks that we have so many tasks roll over onto the next Sprint that I am often wondering if we're just wasting time.  Apologies if it's confusing, it's very hard to explain the situation. "
913,Is there Scrum ceremony for planning Technical Details on an Agile Project?,"Specifically, if we assume that the team spend a day on Sprint Planning using the 4-8 hours of planning for each week of our sprint formula then that doesn't really seem like enough time for the team to flesh out implementation details. And should the entire delivery team really be involved in that discussion? At a sprint planning meeting we will have the Product Owner, Scrum Master, Developers and Testers (Maybe even a Business Analyst or 2). Do we really want to go deep on Dev with all of these other team members burning hours? Or should this be discussed in a separate developers only meeting? It just doesn't appear that Scrum provides for this? Am I missing something? How is your team dealing with this? "
914,How can I attain my PMP PDUs fast and cheap?,My Project Management Professional (PMP) 3 year cycle is ending soon and I am short 15 Professional Development Unit (PDUs). What is a fast and cheap way to get these units online? Can anyone recommend good courses especially ones that allow you to learn how to use software for project management and scheduling? 
915,How does specialization fit into Scrum?,"One of the rules of the Scrum states the team should self organize and be in control of the technical part of the project. It is rather easy when Product Owners are delivering tasks which every member of the team is capable of dealing with. But there are some cases when it became more complicated, for example:   When it comes to deciding on architecture of the project it is noticeable that one of the team members is much more experienced, so democracy in decision making in such area is maybe not the best idea. (or such team member is brought to the project especially because of previous problems with architecture) Some products are designed for specialized group of people. Product Owners have the knowledge about functionalities they want to introduce and how such features should look like, but each task needs also a legal advice on it's subject. Probably legal advisors should be introduced to the team.   I could bring more examples if needed but you get the image...  So my question is: ""How does specialization fit into Scrum?""  and ""How to introduce work of specialists into tasks taken by Scrum team?""  My thinking is:   When I throw task at the team they should be capable of doing it. If they do not have all the knowledge, technical skills or competences needed then such task should remain out. Introducing specialist to the team only in order to handle such tasks would probably create botle necks and is rather a fake solution to the problem.   So how to fit them properly into the team? "
916,How to show the PMI Organization that I worked for one year and for more than 1500 hours? What kind of proof and documents do they want?,"I worked as project coordinator (for the first time) in an oil and gas company. In the beginning, when I met the project manager who interviewed me for the job, I told him I don't have any experience in the field but that my background will allow me to learn it faster. I mentioned I need to have some training. He said I  would learn the skill on the go.  My job on this project is to  make the environment (the field / site  where the drilling work take place) ready by making sure the needed materials, people (personnel), vehicles, equipment, catering, accommodation are all available throughout the project duration.  I want to obtain the CAPM certificate.  How can I show the PMI organization that I worked for one year and for more than  1500 hours? What kind of proof and documents do they need to pass the audit stage to be qualified to take the exam? "
917,How can short-term product development co-exist with long-term innovation projects?,"We have some product teams for improving/maintaining the current line of products; but there are also ""innovation teams"" which try to plan/shape/design the next-generation products. The former teams usually look at short-term goals (small improvements, time frames between few days and few months) while the latter teams do long-term research and development (years?).  My fear is that the short-term improvements will be superseded by the long-term overhauls made by the innovation team; ie. the manpower put into short-term improvements must actually pay off before the next-gen product is out... I think this heavily limits what tasks the short-term teams can start, and I'd like to change that. So is it possible to direct both teams in a way that short-term improvements are not lost? Or is that not generally impossible, and we should try harder to keep the short-term tasks really short?  Related questions:   is there existing research on this topic? Under which terms would I find this research? should short-term teams and innovation teams work closely together (to improve idea flow in both directions, or to improve idea flow in a specific direction), or should they be separated (to avoid disrupting the teams with useless information)?  "
918,Who speaks with the client about the active project?,"We are programming company. One guy is seeking jobs and talking to clients. Then when the job terms are negotiated, a project gets its own project manager and programmers.   Once a project is started, who should talk to the client about project-specific things? If there is a coding problem, then it's obviously a developer that will have such conversations.   However, should the PM take on all further conversations with the client, or should it be left to person who negotiated the job terms? It seems to me that the PM would be a better choice than the negotiator once the project has started. "
919,Partially introduce Scrum into a team,"The CEO of our small company (14) asked me to introduce some elements of Scrum into the working process of our development team.  Problem is: the piece he would like to see introduced is not really the main part. It mainly the daily scrum meeting.  The problem is that to introduce Scrum completly would force him to change his own work (constitue backlog, define content of sprints, and so on), and he obviously doesn't want that...  I can see the benefits of introducing these small bits of Scrum. Better communication of the team, mainly, as we have no CTO, it's rather a self-organizing team anyway.  I have also some hopes that ones we have begun with Scrum, we could further integrate the method.  Do you have seen something like this yet? How does it turn out? "
920,Do we create application-level stories?,"Quoting an example.   If I have a user story which says:     As an administrator I should be able to query all users (both active and inactive) from my database when in my master configuration (Admin section of application) the flag 'return inactive user' is set as true.   Assume, now if we need to implement we need two developers: one for creating this flag in Master configuration and another one to modify the existing search logic (which exists somewhere else and not in the Admin section) to return Inactive users based on the flag value.  Now the question is, can we create two stories as:   Creating master configuration in Admin Module and Updating existing search mechanism to handle Inactive users.   Or we stick to the above mentioned story and create sub-tasks related to Admin Module and Updating existing search?  I hope my question makes sense now?  [Using Jira] "
921,What are the first steps to take when given a new project?,"After you've resisted the urge to run towards the door screaming, what are the first two or three things that you do to get your thoughts in order when you have been given a new project? I tend to start to think of the desired objectives and start to sketch out what I know, then develop high level plans from there, but how do others approach it? "
922,Involve graphic designer in daily Scrum meetings,"As I explained in a previous question, our company is willing to introduce some elements of the Scrum method in our working process.  We have a in-house graphic designer, who is attached to the marketing part of the company, but feels more related to the technical team, as he also creates stuff and works with us in the production of the features of our online application.  Do you think it's a good idea to involve our graphic designer in our daily Scrum meeting? Have you seen it before? With which results? "
923,Starting a developement team,"I'm going to graduate in software engineering, ""I can"" code in Java (Android), JavaScript (jQuery, Angularjs), HTML, CSS, i know Python and Django Framework. I've never developed big projects, but some ""scholastic stuff"", such as apps for time scheduling at school or an app about voting music in concerts. I studied some exams about IEEE and ISO, UML, GANTT, Use Case Diagrams, and all the time they teach us ""what they do"" but never ""how to do them""... now I'd like to start a little team with my colleagues, but I've never managed true projects with these tools... where should I start? How could I truly learn this kind of managing from the scratch, while I've never done it in practice? Which books and/or experiences?  Sorry for my bad English, hope I let you understand what I need. "
924,User stories vs Functional specifications,What is the main difference between user stories and functional specifications (other than the format they are in)? When should I use user stories and when specifications. Do they go hand in hand with agile and waterfall respectively?  
925,How long should an Agile Sprint be?,"I'm currently the PM on a project that is scheduled to run for about 14 months. The current sprint structure is 4 weeks of development; week 5 allows us to show the progress to the client, deploy it for their testers, eliminate bugs and discuss the next sprint.  Given the length of the sprint is 4 to 5 weeks, it will generate about 13 to 14 sprints.  Is this a reasonable number of sprints, or should we look to have fewer sprints (say 8-10) for a project of this duration? Is there a rule of thumb on a reasonable number of sprints for a project with several man years of budget? "
926,What are the best metrics and reports for doing strategic application portfolio management?,"We are a technology organization supporting a line of businesses.  We are currently managing a large budget with a portfolio of over 100 applications and hundreds of projects that impact these applications (some projects affect a single application and some affect multiple applications). We are tracking lots of detail and high level information including:   List of all application with buy/sell/hold, future end state, etc. list of all projects with RAG status, risks, dependencies, etc and change history around status (active, pipeline, etc), resourcing, etc.   So we have lots of data, but I am trying to figure out how we can use this data to help people understand what is really going on and to help people (both technology management and our business management) make strategic decisions.  What is the right ""dashboard view"" (or views) that are useful for management to look at? Are there standard reports or metrics / ratios, etc that should be included?  I see a lot of articles on this, but I can't find concrete specific on what people think are the key views to help drive a strategy.  As stated here, I am trying to figure out the best way to show how we are doing against our strategy and to help drive strategic decision making.  Any suggestions? "
927,Do I Need to Match-up the Functional Spec with the Spec in the Contract,"This maybe a bit of a noob question to you client facing PM's out there, but I'm a PM with a pre-sales background, so please bear with me.  I'm used to working on projects where you have an initial scope (high level) and you work with the customer to define their requirements, forming some sort of a functional specification. Sometimes there may be an RFP, but it's usually not contractual.  I recently started a new job working as a PM for a vendor dealing predominantly with government clients (IT). My first project is rather big, with a mix of off the shelf and in-house (customised) software. We won the project in response to a tender, in which was included a set of general / functional specifications - two documents labeled exactly that.  Now, it's a fairly complex project; thus, there will be many days of requirements gathering. But as I understand it, we are contractually obligated to deliver (within scope) what is defined in the specs. In fact, the original specs are quite detailed (user should be able to hover over link and see a preview of the image, etc..)  I'm supposed to eventually (after all our requirements gathering sessions) come up with a functional specification that is somehow derived from the conversations we have with the users, plus the original specifications, of course.  The problem is that, after reading functional specs (and other project documentation) from other project managers in my company, I see that there is rarely any link back to the contractual tender specification. I feel that there is something missing, i.e when the client eventually signs off on our specs, surely they will check to make sure they conform to the original tender specs? Where our functional spec does not conform, surely they will ask questions.  I suppose my point is this: After speaking to the end user, some points of the original tender specs (contract) may become invalid, may change, or there may be additions (within scope). So, should there be a matrix in between the two documents (original spec and end functional spec) to track all this?  Many thanks for any information on this. I just feel like there is a big gap somewhere. "
928,"Effort vs (Size, Productivity, Duration)","Well, this metric is causing some troubles in my head.  As far as I understood, its magnitude is: man/hour. So for example, if in a project I put two employees working, the effort would be: 2 man/hour. Is this ok?  Then suppose my industry is Software development, and the productivity of each man is 100 LinesOfCode/hour.  Is this magnitude ok?  That means that my total productivity per hour is: Effort*IndividualProductivity = 200 LinesOfCode/hour. Is this ok?  If my project size is 1000 LinesOfCode, that means that: Duration = Size/TotalProductivity = 1000/200 = 5 hours.  I'm sorry this is not an specific question. It's more like an 'Its ok this reasoning?' one. "
929,How can Motion Charts be applied as a project management tool?,I wanted to see if anyone has used motion charts for project management or project reviews over time or for any general application portfolio management?  I see gensight solution seems to give you a few motion charts to try to highlight project risks or strategy alignment  Which ones do you use for general application portfolio or project management?  Are these more beneficial than non-motion charts? 
930,Leveling; getting unexpected results,"I have spent hours reading up on the leveling algorithm and trying various alternative approaches but I have a problem I simply can't figure out.  I'm using MSP 2016.  My schedule consists of around 1250 tasks made up of about 250 separate and independent projects each with about 5 tasks.  Each project and its related tasks has been assigned a unique Priority Score; eg Project A and all its tasks are 950 whereas Project B and all its tasks are 949.  However, the higher ranked project may be further down the ID hierarchy; eg Project A with score 950 may have starting ID of 525 whereas Project B with score of 949 may start at ID 275.  My leveling options are Month by Month with Can split tasks.  Initially I chose Priority, Standard as the leveling order.  This worked pretty well but I found a few tasks that were inexplicably leveled to start AFTER lower priority unrelated tasks, even where there appeared to be available resource to start on or sooner after the original Start date.  In a particular case the lower ranked task was delayed by leveling to start on 1 Jan and finish on 31 Jan, whereas the higher ranked task, which had a longer duration of 2.5 months and which should have started on 17 Jan was delayed to 1 Feb.  So that is my first question; how could this happen?  Why was the lower priority task not split to allow the higher priority task to use the available resources and start on 17 Jan?  In fact, why was this task delayed at all when there appears to be sufficient available resource?  I then sorted my plan by Priority and then ID, and then permanently updated the ID values to this new sort order.  Then I tried leveling by ID only.  The results were similar (not surprisingly) but not exactly the same, and still had the problem with some tasks not being prioritised correctly.  I then changed the leveling order to Standard and found that the problem task now started on the correct date but now had a longer split mid task and that many higher priority tasks were delayed more than previously.  I have tried to replicate these issues in a simple generic plan but have been unable to do so, so I assume they are an artifact of the complexity of my plan.  However despite its size it really is not complex as each group of 5 or so tasks is independent of all other groups.  This is really causing me some problems, can anyone shed any light on the causes of these apparent inconsistencies?  Thanks  Eric "
931,Should tasks be given as orders?,"Consider an example. An iteration plan is created by a project manager. It contains, say, 50 tasks for designers, programmers, testers. The tasks depend on each other (network diagram is ready). The PM announces the plan for the team and gets team commitment to complete it. People perform first tasks assigned to them.  Now it's time to start tasks that follow the ones already completed. Should people wait for ""go ahead"" from the PM? Or they should continue according to the plan? How ""directive"" the role of project manager should be? "
932,Do you show your RAID log to stakeholders?,"So I have started documented all risk related issues in a RAID log. I am showing my stakeholder it weekly, so that he is aware of all product related risks, but not sure if there is much value in doing so?  What do you think? "
933,Cancel or change a sprint,"The Scrum method defines that the content of a sprint cannot be changed. But can a sprint be cancelled while it's done? I mean, it's unlikely to happen and probably shows really bad planning skills by the product owner and a really awful prioritization of the backlog, but if the features of a sprint are not useful anymore, can the whole sprint be cancelled? Have you seen something like this?  Edit: More generally, are the sprints and their content as sacred as the method recommend it? "
934,"How to handle CEO ""priority"" requests that affect existing client deadlines?","Our team(s) have agreed upon timelines both by the team themselves and the clients, including a bit of extra padding in case of any mistakes.  However, the CEO of the company consistently sends requests down to these teams and wants them done immediately.  While the team has no problem to complete them, and understands the hierarchy of the company (CEO request comes from the top), there are questions about how to manage the existing agreed upon timelines for our clients.  Would you consider to push back the client deadline to work immediately on the CEO request? Usually the CEO requests are 1day-1 week tasks.  Would you try and explain to the CEO that their requests must follow the same workflow as a client request?  Would you hire/train more resources to take care of these spontaneous requests? "
935,How do you kick-off new Agile teams?,"I'm curious what others are doing with regard to getting teams up and running with Agile in a sustainable way. What do you emphasize first (practices, principle, process framework)? Or is there no one approach for kicking off teams?   EDIT: I guess I am still looking for something in between business and technology. Where does that guidance come from and what does it look like? I'd love to hear some ideas on this. "
936,What is the right approach to work package size?,"In medium size project were you are interfacing with functional Project Managers, and you are the PM for the entire project.    How much details do you want in your WBS?    Do you break it and keep it high level but deep enough to know what's going on?    Or do you go all the way in, to the point you know each team members tasks, even if they are 16 hours task? "
937,Do PMs get paid less for in-house apps compared to public-facing ones?,I've been tasked with managing an in-house analytics app that was developed by a past colleague. It's only used for internal client accounts (we're an agency) but we're considering bringing it to market down the road.  Question— do PMs working solely on in-house apps get paid less than ones working on public-facing ones? Seems to me there's less return on investment to quantify and measure success against for internal apps (save for improvements in efficiency) since there are no direct purchase revenues coming in.   So is it considered less valuable in the PM world? 
938,Does anyone use a personal Kanban / Scrum board for project management activities (rather than work items)?,"I've seen plenty of people using Kanban or Scrum boards to manage the work of a project.  However, I also use a personal Kanban board to manage my work at home, so I was curious - does any PM use a Kanban board to manage the work that they, personally, have to do as part of their day-to-day work?  If so, what kind of things do you put on it? Conversations you have to chase up? Information you're waiting for? Reports you have to produce?  Has it been helpful to you, and in what way? Were there any surprises? Recommendations?  (I am looking for more information on using this to focus on personal work, rather than the use of boards for team collaboration and status tools).  If nobody is doing this but someone would like to try, I'd be interested in what you discover. "
939,Collecting And Sharing Status,How do you collect and share status? Some PM's think group status meetings are a waste of time and prefer to collect status in one-on-one's. Others prefer email. What works best for you?  How do you collect updates on various tasks and share it across the team? 
940,Is it important to estimate the product size for software project?,"Estimate size is the process of approximating the size for of the products and parts to be produced for the project. Is it important to estimate the size, especially for the software project? Does the PMBOK address this aspect?   Size of software product e.g., Lines of Codes.  "
941,Is system 'logging' captured in user stories or are they part of implementation detail?,"I understand that anyone who supports and maintains system can be seen (or should be seen?) as a stakeholder/user.    For me, so far 'logging' has been like:     ""I guess, it wouldn't hurt to log this activity here""     or     ""This error definitely needs to be logged."".     I'm leaning towards that logging is a subtle part of implementation detail.  However. I can construct some stories.     As a maintainer,   I would like to read systems activities of problematic (payment)transaction,   so that I can find and fix the problem.        As a maintainer,   In case of unhandled error I would like to read potential systems activities that lead to that situation,   so that I can find and fix that problem.     Additionally, I have been in the situation where client encountered an error in production and told us to read the logs for details and I was like 'what logs?' - he took 'logging' for granted. There were logs, but nevertheless, I was a bit surprised.  Is system 'logging' captured in user stories (treated as any other feature) or are they part of implementation detail? "
942,Should impact on schedule because of scope change be reported as delay?,"In my company, if there is any delay in the schedule I need to report the delay-reason and countermeasure. Sometimes this delay happens because of scope change.   My question is: Should I report it as ""delay"" in that case what would be the countermeasure? or I should just report updating the schedule without reporting delay? "
943,Overrun on Duration,"I'm working on a school project and we are having trouble updating our MS Project 2016 file.  For a little background: The tasks all have fixed duration and some have dependencies on others being completed. We baselined the file the day we started the project.  We then completed task one about three days past the finish date listed in project. If I update the line to say it's finished three days late, it pushes all other tasks after to be started three days later, resulting in the project itself being late by three days.  We compensated for the lost three days by working more resources on the following task, finishing that task in the original finish date for that task, not the new one that Project created for it because the first task was finished late. We did this because cost was not an issue, but deadline is.  How do I correct for this in the Project file? Do I remove the dependencies so things don't auto-adjust? "
944,Project Management and sales activities,"Recently my company insists that the PM should be strongly engaged in sales activities like writing offers, negotiating with clients, supervising the sales process. Sometimes it happens that the PM leads the process from client request to order.  On the one hand it is good because when the project is starting PM knows what kind of work it will be, and also he develops his skills.  On the other hand, such operations sometimes interfere with actual PM's work, forcing him to do tasks, which in my opinion does not fall within the competence of Project Manager.  I wonder if it's a good direction in PM's work, and how common it is in the IT industry.  So, is it correct / valuable to have the Project Manager also conducting sales activities for the same project? What are the benefits or caveats on this approach? "
945,Making sprint GREEN,"In a sprint (#1) we decided on tasks and user stories. One of the task we thought of 6 hours turns out to be a difficult one, due to technical complexity. The complexity was such that we can't estimate it even in the middle of the sprint. All we knew that we can try to fix it with plan A, if not then plan B, if not then plan C. After each plan execution we retrospect and deviced plan D,E,F. Eventually the commited user story spilled to next sprint (#2).  Now under same user story, in sprint #2, in another task developer notice due to frequent requirement changes the code is NOT in good state. Thus it should be optimized as well. So developer done the optimization under same tasks, which took time obviously and user story spilled to sprint #3.  In sprint #3, there were bugs for the same user story which were fixed timely and sprint #3 went fine.  I do not see any performance problem OR job not done correctly by the developers. But our 2 out of 3 sprints shows 1 user story spilled twice and thus those sprints are red.  Now my questions: Q. What went wrong in managing our sprints? Q. What measures we should have taken to make our first two sprints green? Q. How to handle the alert raised by the developer about the code quality?  One last generic question, making sprint GREEN, is the whole and sole goal of the team? "
946,How to make personal tasks in Asana reflect general project task priorities,"We use Asana a lot for task and bug management with less technically oriented customers and externals. This works well except for one feature that keeps confusing everybody: the fact that the order of tasks (i.e. the visual representation of the task priorities) in each user's ""My Tasks"" list is independent of the order of tasks in the project view, where the tasks of all users can be seen.  After logging in, a user sees her own tasks, and new tasks appear at the top under ""New Tasks"" and can be prioritized as the users sees fit. So we explain to the users not to use their ""My Tasks"" view but to go straight to the project view. This is, however, not intuitive for most of the people and always leads to confusion.  Is there a way to handle this better so that the project task order is sort of forced on the users task order?  Update - clarification - I'll try to visualize my problem here. Let's say I have a workspace named DEMO and a project named tasks. I click on the project in the left sidebar and add three task - Task 1, Task 2 and somewhat later Task Urgent and assign them to a collaborator:    I decide to move Task Urgent up (drag &amp; drop):    By design, this priority change (done in the project view) is not reflected in the collaborator view who still sees the original order:    He or she can now 1. mark each new task for today, upcoming or later and 2. order the tasks independent of the order in the project view.  I am the project manager, so I could, of course, click on the collaborator, set all new tasks to Upcoming, and prioritize his tasks there as well. But I definitely want to avoid this double work, and while there may be scenarios where this total independence of orders is desired, what I would prefer is that clicking on a user (or on My Tasks) works more like a filter on the main project list, using the same order of tasks and possibly even the same sections.  What I do now is tell all new collaborators to use the project view only and not their individual ones. But My Tasks is the default view, and so this doesn't work so well.  I have a feeling that I am missing something here, maybe use Asana the wrong way (although it is designed to be used with various work flows), but on the other hand having the same priorities for each and every team member seems to natural. How can I use Asana to accomplish that? "
947,Estimated costs,"Should I consider a margin calculating work hours, then increase the final cost, based on estimated hours + margin hours? Or should I add a margin after the estimated hours of work, increasing the final amount?  Edit: the problem  In a project with N resources, which have a different cost per hour, I want to consider a margin of error in the estimation of the final cost. So I wonder which method is the most accurate/correct/used, to be used to calculate the total of my project. "
948,Project schedule reviews,"As a PMO project coach, I am often asked to review the time schedule of projects. Some are detailed schedules in MS Project while some are high level (capacity) planning in a spreadsheet. There are waterfallish types of projects, as well as projects using sprint planning, like (Scrum) or Kanban.  Even though few projects are alike, I try to be objective by reviewing the following items:   Exhaustive WBS and scope: Is there a big chance on surprises or big changes? How reliable are the estimates? Resource availability checked. Any external dependencies? Have other risks and risk mitigation plans been taken into account?   The overall aim of course is to improve predictability and coach junior or new PMs with best practices. But all this doesn't come cheap, and I need to be able to scale this process (although the number of projects is growing, current staffing of the PMO needs to remain constant). So short of rebuilding the schedules myself,    What would be a standardized, minimal and methodical check for a schedule review? Would it be possible to assign a score or metric, some kind of quality evaluation of the schedule that could serve as an early warning sign? And finally, is there an easier way to compare the original plan against what actually happened (analysing the five bullets above, taking into account the impact of changes and management decisions), without getting lost in the finer details of project life but good enough to be used as Lessons Learned?    Hmm, now that I have written out this question, I am even more skeptical :-). "
949,Ample free time,"I'm handling a Production support team. How to keep the team motivated and busy when the daily 'Business As Usual's are mostly automated and the team requires 2-3 hours in the day to complete the manual work? The management team doesn't want to shuffle/reduce the team, anticipating a new project will be live in the near future (maybe 1-2 months).  The team already has done a few proof of concepts and obtained new learnings on the technical and process side. They also help the other teams whenever required.  The question is: how to engage the team and make ideal use of the free time? "
950,Tool suggestion to manage multiple projects / people working on several projects at once?,"This is the situation in our office and I would need a recommendation which tool to you to facilitate our work. At the moments, things are slowly slipping out of my hands.   What we have:     many projects with its own tasks   many people working simultaneously on multiple projects and tasks   people are paid per project and per tasks, but we also have internal milestones     How to track all of this? Which tool to use?  Please let me know if you need more details as I am not sure what else to say.  "
951,What to do when WIP limits must be broken?,"So I've been trying to push Kanban, and consequently having WIP (Work In Progress) limits, but there's one question I keep being asked that I don't have a great answer for:  ""What happens when we're at our WIP limit and 'do it now' work crops up?""  What I've considered is taking something currently in-progress out of in-progress, essentially pretending it was never started in the first place. This would be rather jarring event, and much work could be lost (even with some/all of it being committed, there would be losses due to hand-offs, knowledge decay, etc.)  Another option is to just violate the WIP limit, but that has downsides as well (possibility that the WIP itself may become irrelevant, loss due to task-switching, etc.)  Is there a better approach? "
952,How to maintain a spec for a large complex project with repetitive patterns?,"I need to maintain a meticulous spec that contains a lot of legal requirements.   We have more than 200 products (and rapidly growing, about 5 products a month) which are all very similar but have differences.   Currently, we find ourselves starting the spec with the following words: ""product Y is like X but differs with A, B, C, D.."", ""product Z is like Y but differs with E, F, G..""  Each product will eventually have more than 100 differences (out of thousands of requirements).   Which is a convoluted way for the developers to understand what the final outcome should look like.   We also need to follow about 6 different documents to understand the full spec for a single product, since some of the requirements are better visualized in a table rather than text and we prefer to maintain them in something similar to a spreadsheet.   Could it actually be that the best way to maintain it is the way we do now? And when product X changes to go to Y, Z etc.. and update them accordingly?  "
953,Cost of resources in virtual environments,"In planning hardware costs, considering the distribution of the product in virtual/cloud environments, where the cost is derived from the use of resources, considering the following points:   The minimum hardware architecture is defined; Hardware provider have not yet been chosen, but there is a list of preferences given by the team; Obviously is impossible to consider what will be the expansion (and hence the effective use of the minimal hardware resources); All providers allow the analysis of costs, through the use of simulators of resources, and is therefore predictable the maximum cost (24/7);   How to communicate this type of variable costs? In order to define the true cost of the hardware infrastructure, A) it is appropriate to consider the maximum use of hardware resources, B) or there are different methods to determine the cost of resources in virtual environments?  Option A is the one that I took into account when projecting costs. One of the requests of the client, is to reduce the cost of infrastructure. The market analysis and consultations with the representatives of the different hardware providers, push the client to consider virtual environments. But when planning costs, option A, it does not seem to respect what the analysis offers. So I'm wondering if this type of variable costs, must be projected as a maximum. "
954,Enterprise Mobile-first multi-team-product organization,"I am the mobile product owner (PO) at a firm with a dozen or so scrum teams each managing their own web products.  My team builds mobile versions of the above web products.  I work with each product owner to bring features of their web apps to our mobile platform picking and choosing features that make the most sense on mobile.  We build native iOS and Android apps sharing the same backend API's each products web team created.  My firm's long-term goal is to strive for mobile-first products and features that will eventually make their way into each web product.  I am tasked with looking across all of the teams to determine if it still makes sense to have a single mobile scrum team in lieu of each web team building both mobile and web versions of their products.  Bringing dedicated iOS and android developers to each web scrum team.  That way each team controls their product from mobile to web.  Their domain knowledge stays within the team vs the mobile team having to understand and keep up with each team's direction, quirks, priorities etc.  I feel it would be very difficult for each web team to manage the diversity of mobile challenges with consistent results.  What are other firms doing?  When a team owns a product does that team typically build mobile &amp; web? or leave mobile (as we do) to a dedicated mobile team.  Thoughts?    Thanks! "
955,"Swimlane, category or new project for grouping dependent projects in Kanboard","We have just recently started to use Kanboard, but still not sure how to apply our projects in the Kanboard system. We have a couple of major software projects contains sub-projects such as Delphi components, Lazarus components, Windows version, Linux version, Innosetup maker, documentation, etc. We would like to know how to initially create the structure of the projects/swimlanes/categories in the Kanboard to start using it. Could anyone explain the usage of and the difference between swimlane and category in Kanboard? How should we fit the mentioned sub-projects in a project, swimlane or category? "
956,Scope in 4 party sponsored open source project,"As a web development company, we are developing highly customized and complex websites based on a popular open source platform (Joomla). I see that 4 of our clients have an overlapping problem, so I have an idea to solve this problem for them. I have pitched the idea to get 40h of work funded by each of them for this project and had generally quite positive responses.  My question here centers around how to manage scope for the development, as these clients are used to get (and pay for) exactly what they want.  The current idea is to make a very detailed plan for half of the available funding and reserve the half to make 4 very specific customizations to the project for each client. Obviously the exact needs could be researched much more deeply as well, to split the funds 60%/40% etc.  Is this a reasonable idea to manage scope? What is the most correct way to manage this scope? "
957,Work days and Duration does not match,I am using a 5 working days &amp; 8 hours standard calendar. My task is 30 days . I have selected a start date on Monday and end date on Friday (30th work day) but the durationn reflects as 40 days instead of 30 days? How can I ensure that the duration reflects the correct work days for the task? 
958,Is the PM responsible of producing the Executive Summary?,"My understanding is that this Summary, along with the majority of the Business Case, should be developed by the Executive role.   I have been requested to produce an Executive Summary since I will manage the project but I lack the  understanding of what the project is actually trying to achieve. The Executive Manager in this case has set up this project as a Business Process Improvement by using SharePoint but hasn't given me any direction so I cannot determine when we will be able to consider that the improvement has been reached.  I am not sure if this Executive Summary is meant to be part of our Business Case or if it's just a document to inform Senior Management of our plans. Anyhow I would like to make sure whose responsibility is this to approach the right person.  As PM have you ever had to produce these Summaries? What other roles' support have you used? "
959,Is there a role for formal Business Analysts and Systems Analysts in Agile teams?,"Apologies for the long ramble and fairly short question but I wanted to set the scene (as such)   Within all the blogs and articles on-line we use the term ""Generalist"" or ""Team Member"" when discussing agile teams.  However within the organisation I work for (a large corporate) we have the classic roles (PM, SA, BA, Dev, Test)  Historically we have worked in a waterfall manner or ""closet"" agile which basically means ""Water SCRUM Fall"" but we have made very good use of Axure and Balsamic for our prototyping.  However we want to improve our practices and so are looking at Microsoft's ALM tools and TFS seems a very good tool pretty much out of the box.  TFS integrates with:   Both Excel and Project for Project Managers Test Manager Integration for Testers Storyboarding for Systems Analysts ...well almost.   It turns out for TFS needs a full version of Visual Studio to be installed to get access to the storyboarding functionality in PowerPoint, which to me indicates Microsoft feel this is a task which should be carried out by a dev.  So I guess I'm asking is there a role for formal Business Analysts and Systems Analysts in Agile teams?  If there is and others have experience out there how do they best interact with TFS? "
960,How to have the time a task would take and duration for a task in MS Project 2010?,"Within my projects I would like to have two different notions of time for a task:   How many hours of actual work the task is expected to take A time frame for the task that the above hours should be done in   My reasoning behind this is that the people working on these tasks should be very loosely managed and have a lot of independence.   The general time frame will allow me to use the start date as a way to remind them of the tasks, and check in with them to make sure that they can meet the end date. I also figure the general time frame will allow me to leverage the convenience of auto scheduling. The actual work hours will make sure that I am not asking to much from any one person at a time (across multiple projects).   Is there a more proper vocabulary for what I am describing here? How can I do this with MS Project 2010? Accepting the idea of loose management as a correct premise, is there anything beyond that from what I am describing that could be a major pitfall with this methodology.  "
961,What project management methods will keep a visionary person on task?,"I'm tasked with realizing a project that was created by a visionary stakeholder. This individual needs to play a role in making the project happen day-to-day. But as we work towards deadlines, this person feels comfortable envisioning different versions of the future, rather than looking at a task list and picking things off one-by-one to accomplish. Deadlines get missed, and we're going to slip into the red zone if the behavior doesn't change.  I tried organizing work into Agile-like sprints, because there's a software development aspect to the project. But the visionary found this to be too pressure-filled and stressful and abandoned that methodology unilaterally.  What project management methods would tend to keep a visionary person on task? Would short daily status meetings tend to help? ""What did you work on? What will you work on? What's the priority?""  This article seems relevant. It discusses specific change resistance tactics and ways to handle them.      ""Crossing the change river is hard. Some cowboys who are true entrepreneurs will not be able to cross, others will. Our job as leaders is to help them try, and find the best seat on the bus for them, even if sometimes it is another bus.""  "
962,How to correctly define tasks in a user story? And can you split the tasks between sprints?,"I'm fairly new to Scrum and I'm working with a group of colleagues on a project to learn more about it. Long story short our project is simply creating a website for tourists of our country where they can simply create or use courses in a certain city.  What we did is think about user stories (We didn't really do any UX Research so just consider these stories as valid) that are relevant to what we want to make. For example, consider the following story:     As a tourist, I want to create courses according to my requirements.   This is just a example, we have around other 15 stories. And since we are new to this process, we defined tasks of stories that we saw more fitting with the story. For example we need to make a login/signup page but we couldn't make a story for it so we included it in the most relevant story. So there are few stories with extra tasks. And since we followed this approach, we actually estimated the tasks and no the stories (somewhat a hack?). Now the problem we're facing is we need to use a scrum tool to help us visualize our work, we chose TargetProcess which is free. In this tool story points are obviously given to stories, while estimation by hour is given to the tasks, and each task is a part of a story. Now if we need to work on a task, we can't do so unless we move the whole story into the sprint backlog. So if a story has only one task planned into the sprint and the rest are not, that would create a problem in creating our burn down charts. So my question here is what could we do to make this work? "
963,"How can story points be ""non linear"" in relative size","I've read in several places that story points are not necessarily linear.  i.e., an ""8 point"" task is not the same as two 4 point tasks and so on.  I totally get the argument about these being an indication of complexity rather than time taken.  But if they're not a linear scale, then how can you do arithmetic on them? If an 8 story point takes, say, 3 times longer than 2 x 4 story points, then how do burndown charts work from an arithmetic point of view?   If our velocity is, say, 30 a sprint then this means we could do 30 x 1 story point features. But these might be, 30 half an hour jobs. Equally if it was 2 x 15 story point features, these are probably monster tasks which seems equally unlikely.  Perhaps I am wrong in my assertion that they are non-linear?  Or can anyone explain this to me?  Thanks! "
964,Should Product Owner be present on all retrospectives?,"As a scrum master I will join new development team.   Some additional information about environment:   The team works iteratively, but they don't do any retrospectives, Previous scrum master (I'd rather say project manager) was quite authoritative, The product owner is also the direct boss to all team members at the same time.    I was present on a few standups as a guest and have some reflections on it; thus, I would like to ask the team some questions about it. This is why I want to introduce retrospective meetings.  I informed the product owner -- the boss of the team members -- that I'd like to spend 1 hour weekly on such meetings. He agreed. I also told him that retrospectives are for the team and he doesn't have to be present on all meetings. Then he didn't agree. He wants to be present on all meetings.  In my opinion his presence may cause retrospectives to be biased - people will not behave naturally, hiding some information for political reasons.   Am I right? What are important repercussions of such a configuration? What should I be aware of?  "
965,"Update project plan, rescheduling and dates","I'm trying to understand the update function in MS Project 2010 and I hope you can help.  Let's say I have a road-project where I have divided a task in to several activities based on where the task is performed. To simplify my example I will call the task ""Build Road"". Here are the example activities:    Originally, all activities are planned to be built in sequence (top to bottom).  After production start we begin having production problems on different stretches. To try and keep the schedule we decide to start working on several fronts.  So as a planner in this project I start to follow up the production.    To keep track of project finish date and to help manage the project i choose to Update the project and move unfinished work to report date.    I keep doing this continuously in the project and after a while my schedule looks like this:    Now my questions:   Is this a smart way to keep track of project progress? what are the risks? is there a better way? Where can I find the new startdates for the remaining work on the different partial activities? MS Project 2010 gives me the new end dates (and project finish date) but I cant't find the start dates for the different partials. What starts happening if I, mid-way, start to update the durations of some tasks because I have recalculated the project with new capacities? what do I have to keep in mind? For example to increase production to minimise delays.   I appreciate any input you can give on this! Thanks!  In this project there is not enough time to keep track of resources and work within MS Project so we are only working with durations (no resources or work in the .mpp).  (For those who know what flowline/line-of-balance is, this is an attempt to use flowline in an Gantt-environment when no flowline schedule application is avaliable.)  Best regards "

Does anybody know the name and website? I can't stand that I forgot what it was... :s  Is a tool like that actually beneficial for a project manager? "
969,Can the Definition of Done be overriden or changed?,"Does the Definition of Done come before everything else, almost like a programming interface? And can it be changed if later on, once it’s realized that it was designed poorly?  By overriden, I mean can individual rules be nullified by more specific protocols like Acceptance Criteria or Acceptance Tests?  If the Definition of Done requires the team to use a specific coding standard, and the acceptance criteria explicitly states something else, which would take precedence? Would it be the explicit acceptance criteria, or would the variance simply not allowed?  Would the Scrum Master be able to change the Definition of Done, if the stated requirements are structured poorly? "
970,How to measure and count sprint progress in new daily meeting aproach?,"I've recently found article on scrum aliance about new efficient form of Daily Scrum Meetings: Change Your Daily Scrum Meeting.

What is our plan for completing story 1 today? What if anything is blocking you?   My question is: Who is estimating the progress? All team members or those who contributed in story?

972,How to deal with the situation that some people's work is not fulfilled during a sprint?,"We are game developers and just began our Scrum practice. We found something like this:  During a sprint, we have several user stories to complete, but some of our members' work is not fulfilled. At the same time, someone may work overtime to complete them. This is basically caused by role differences, like artists vs. programmers, etc. For example, we have enough artists but not enough programmers, so that when programmers are working hard to death, artists may find themselves having nothing to do. So ok, I think saying that ""caused by role differences"" is wrong. More precisely, it is caused by lack of people of certain professions. Of course we're hiring, but how to get this through now?  Our solution now is to create small user stories dedicated to the people whose work is not fulfilled, like ""concept art for character X"", but apparently it is not a normal user story for us. Why abnormal? Because usually our user story is kind of ""make character X"", which includes concept art, animations, feature implementations, etc. ""concept art for character X"" is just too small and not on the same level of detail here.  So what's the best practice to deal with this kind of situation? "
973,"I've been doing Agile for years in various organisations, but I still don't feel like we're doing it right?","So in my current organisation for the past year we have been doing the ""full-blown"" Agile stuff to create software. From planning, refinement, daily SCRUM stand-ups, programming and testing in 2-weekly cycles, through to sprint reviews and even postmortems.  Our software chugs along and we make a reasonable amount of releases. As a dev team we are fairly happy because we go through all our rituals according to our Outlook calendar. Management are generally pretty relaxed because we have many small customers instead of a few large ones (losing one is not a big deal).  However, I feel like the biggest reason for Agile was supposed to be to bridge the divide between developers and management, and also keep customers on the same page - esp. with the Extreme Programming flavour. When my boss asks individual developers when they can expect a feature that is currently being worked on to be released for customers, we are dumbstruck and can't give an answer. We estimated based on effort, not hours - so we intentionally didn't communicate poor estimates to management. We know that our estimates are often incorrect, and we work to improve them. However, we still try to hide behind the guise of not telling management our estimates, as per many recommendations with Agile online and in books. We simply tell them what tasks we think we can fit into a Sprint.  As mentioned, this is all good, until a customer wants to know when it will be done so they can achieve some level of planning for their business. And management want to know because part of their job is to know. Furthermore, management never join our sprint reviews so we never get to talk about this kind of issue.  What are we doing wrong as developers / scrum masters? How do you suggest we could improve this kind of situation and feel more comfortable when the boss asks us an important question? "
974,Are there any brainstorming techniques related to requirement gathering sessions or Sprint Reviews that can help produce ideas?,"Adding creativity techniques to Scrum product planning  I'm evaluating some creativity techniques to produce ideas/solve problems, whether they could have a benefit in Scrum or not. Specifically, I'm looking at the process where the Product Owner and Customer collaborate on software requirements at the beginning and the Sprint Review at the end.  My question is: Are there any techniques related to the requirement sessions or Sprint Reviews which can help produce ideas? Are ideas important for these sessions?  "
975,Non-technical testers on a Scrum team,"We're trying to get started with Scrum and I'm not sure how to handle QA in our situation.  Like many organizations, QA and product development are separate entities.  However, we have QA teams that are dedicated to individual products, so I don't think incorporating them into a Scrum team is going to be a radical change.  The odd part is that our QA team is bigger than the development team on the project that's moving to Scrum.  We've got five developers, one QA lead, and six QA testers.  The QA lead is very technical - a programmer who lost his way.  There are two other fairly technical QA folks who are getting into automated testing.  The remaining four are not very tech savvy and basically just walk through predefined test procedures.  Currently, QA gets a release every two or three weeks and just tests that until the next drop.  We're dealing with an old, horribly buggy codebase at the moment so they have lots to do on each release.  We're going to wipe the slate clean pretty soon, at which point we're going to get serious about unit testing.  I'd also like to start doing continuous integration and have QA test each bug and user story when it's finished being developed.  Hopefully the end result will be a lot less bugs and a much quicker feedback loop.  So with all that said, the question is who to include in the development team.  Clearly the QA lead will be part of it.  The two people working on automated testing might be a good fit as well since they'll probably be able to make sense of programmer talk and hopefully even contribute to planning and estimation.  I really don't know how to handle the other four.  It seems like they should know what's going on at all times, but I don't know how much they'd take away from the meetings and including them will make the team bigger than I'd like.  But then I also don't want to have hurt feelings by excluding them.  What should we do?  Try a team of 12 people?  Draw the line at eight?  Perhaps only include the lead and let him delegate to the others the way he currently does? "
976,Specifications in spreadsheets vs. stories in JIRA,"I think this is a very common issue a lot of companies fight with. So I would like to ask for your input.  Product Owners often prefer to keep specifications in Google spreadsheet. And then write user stories in JIRA (or any other tool) that link to said spreadsheet. Especially when things get complicated. But this often gets out of hand and suddenly you have a lot of different places to check as a developer to make sure you fulfilled the acceptance criteria.   From a developer perspective there are a couple of things that speak against spreadsheets:   No transparent versioning. You have to navigate past, present and future with color codes or in different sub-sections Not all the information is present in the story, so you need to first collect information before you can start to work on a story. They aren’t designed to store files, annotations, conversations, and related information that are essential parts of project communication and collaboration. When doing the sprint review, it is great to have all the acceptance criteria right in the story in order to efficiently check if something can be considered as ""done"".   From a Product Owner perspective spreadsheets make a lot of sense:   All the specifications are in one place and not scattered along multiple stories. You can create the data structure most fitting for your needs. You can define columns, add multiple sheets to your workbook, etc. You don't have to repeat yourself whenever you write a story. Just reference the spreadsheet.   I am currently moderating between a Product Owner who loves spreadsheets and a Development Team who despises them. I am a developer myself and dislike them, but I see the points the PO makes.  So I guess my questions are:   Are spreadsheets necessarily bad? Are there tools or best practices out there that I am missing?  "
977,Who is responsible for the proper license handling in a software project?,"I recently participated in a discussion where we wanted to find out what kinds of open-source software we can use in our production system. The corporate guidance is not clear, and the project members had a very different understanding on the topic. For example, the mentioned guidance stated that in most cases the license applies when one downloads an open-source project. Which is non-sense.  For me, the situation is similar to the risk management, although a risk usually harms only the project, but a law suite harms the whole company. So it is a bigger deal. This suggests that the license handling is a project manager task, however no-one can expect a project manager to know every single third party library along with their licenses, which are used the project.  I have two examples. First, a developer downloads a third party library, adds it to the build system and to the product. Second, a developer finds a great algorithm with google and adds it to the production code. In both cases the company can face serious law suites if the license agreements are not met, which must be prevented. Of course, the developer can be accounted for this action, and serious new regulations can be introduced in the process, but whose responsibility is to prevent this from happening? And, how to do it? "
978,How does one manage scope in JIRA?,"I work in a software development company. We develop with Fixed Price contracts, thus there's a lot of BDUF (Big design up front). During the initial/planning phase, we create very big monolithic technical scope documents in MSWord and get approval/signature from the customer on it. Then, during development, we refer to these documents: e.g.: ""as per page XX"",or ""as per section XX"", in our work in JIRA tickets. Change requests cause a new version of the specification to be re-created from the MSWord and the modified section or appendix at the end is re-signed. Our customers always need to sign something, they prefer it this way.  I wonder if you can help with the following please:   Is there a way to type the scope in a more granular manner directly in JIRA (e.g.: one functionality per JIRA) and automatically generate a big document to be ""signed""? Would it be possible somehow to track modifications in the JIRA after the signed version was done? Would you use a different tool to type these specifications? E.g.: a tool that somehow integrates into JIRA and you have the scope in there already in a granular manner?   This would force the writers to write the scope in more concise and self-contained manners (and all the scope would be in JIRA facilitating communication). Please note that typing the scope in MSWord and then moving it into JIRA is also an option, but a lot of re-work (~100 pages of it), thus I am looking for a solution where I need to write this only once.  Any help is appreciated.  Thanks! "
979,How can I organize an on demand Support Team for a customer-facing project?,I want to manage a team which developers themselves now support the software produced. Developers are the only people who know how to fix the problems.  The problem is that when something goes wrong the customer calls me as PM and want me to solve the problem asap. Sometimes I try to fix it myself and sometimes I should find other senior developer to solve it. And this is bothering especially when I (or the developer) am at home or on holiday! In most cases the problem cannot be postponed to the next working day and should be fixed immediate. Some can be solved temporarily (for example by resetting the service) and some need more knowledge.  Now I think a support team is needed but I don't know how to define the roles. What they should do ? What they should know about the software ? Should they have the knowledge like developers?  
980,What is a good method for taking and organizing notes about projects?,"What is a good method for taking and organizing notes about projects?   Every day I struggle with problems with multiple projects and it's difficult to make my notes clean and to keep them organized. I have to answer the phone every five minutes so I have to write notes on the conversations somewhere. At the end of the working day my notebook is full of text and chaos and it's very tiring to clean everything up.   I was trying something like the Cornell Notes Taking System, but it wasn't very practical for me. Is there a better system or approach for tracking project information? "
981,Why do we use project RAG status instead of team confidence levels to make it more personal and accountable?,"On lots of PM reporting decks you see the usual RAG status and I was wondering why we do this versus simply putting down ""confidence levels"" that make it more accountable and personal.  ""The project is Red"" seems less accountable and clear compared to ""I have low confidence that I will hit the date listed.""  I feel like the whole RAG status is not very natural and meaningful to many sponsors and project participants (even if its defined somewhere), so I wonder if being more explicit and accountable is actually a better way to report on projects.  Another point is that with RAG, people seems to keep project ""Green"" until there is a problem. Where confidence on delivery might have degraded because of complexity or underestimating, I have observed folks not changing the status early enough.  I feel like if they were forced to put a personal confidence level, things would change much sooner as it represent a statement about them (not just the project status). It's a psychological point but I feel like there is something to it.  Does anyone have any information where RAG came from and if they have any evidence that is better understood than just listing out confidence levels (High, Medium, Low)?  To be clear, I have no issues with actually having the visual colors showing, but just saying ""the project is Amber"" seem one step removed from what we are actually saying...why require the translation? "
982,User Interface Requirements in User Stories,"I'm not sure whether this should be on the ux.stackexchange forum or on here.   As part of a Uni project, the client has given us a brief of mandatory and optional features, from which we have to build user stories. One of the mandatory requirements is that each account type should have a different UI design.  How do you break this down into a user story and functionality before the development has begun? Could it simply be a high level user story that will be broken down later on? If so, I'm a bit confused as to what the 'so that..' would say.  It's worth noting that we have to follow the conventional user story structure. "
983,Forming a composite scrum team with multiple vendors,One of our PMs on her project has a scrum team from Vendor A.  She needed another developer.  So she added one from another vendor.  I like this idea because it keeps Vendor A honest.  I'd like to do the same but the project is currently at design stage so I can't use the resourcing excuse.  How can I:    introduce the idea to the vendor (overcome resistance)?   and   structure the commercials (e.g. SOW for main vendor and T&amp;M for the single contractor)?   I suppose another option is to introduce 2 competing scrum teams but we don't have much budget and I think handling the code merges could be difficult. 
984,Where to put those cards that are finished during the day in Scrumban?,"I've successfully implemented Scrumban. I implement the daily scrum meeting and retrospective. I love how easy the Kanban board is that it helps for the whole team to know where are we now at the moment and also to know how far are we before hitting the milestone.  There is something that keep me wondering, if I have ticket that came from a column called ""Backlog"" and put it under column ""Doing"", once my team already done working on this.   Do they move the ticket straight away from ""Doing"" to ""Done""? Or, we as a team will do it during the daily stand up meeting? Then, from there we will move all the tickets? "
985,"Earned value management with ressources of type ""Cost""","I'm working on project management with the client-side manager. We manage the cost with cost type ressources as we only know how much we are going to pay for each task and not how many hours of work and how much material are put into it.  My question is, when I use this type of ressources, why does MS Project not calculate EV, PV, etc. ? why does it only show EAC and BAC ?  Microsoft Project don't automatically calculate the EV and other variables:   This capture shows how my cost type resources are entered:  "
986,What to do when PO is taking over Daily Scrums,"I am a new Scrum Master for an established Team. The Product Owner (PO) gets along very well with the Team, almost like buddies, and is an ex-developer.   The PO has started taking over my job of facilitating the Daily Scrum meetings.  Because I am quite new, I tend to be less vocal than I guess I should be.   Any ideas what I should do? Should I talk to the PO or what should I do? "
987,Ensuring team motivation and project progress in a highly complex software project,"Our development team is currently facing the problem that the complexity of our software project is draining their motivation/enthusiasm/... Since a few weeks they constantly struggle with pondering over problems for days, making little to no progress. As a result they began questioning their skills and lost motivation.  Our goal now is to improve their motivation and perhaps skills, as well as ensuring project progress... Does anybody have good advice on this matter? Perhaps a good book on conquering complexity?  A bit of background-info: The team consists of five developers including two senior developers. The workplace and working conditions are formidable. "
988,Is the Product Owner the Customer?,"After reading In an agile consultancy, is the Client the Product Owner??, I still can't tell apart if the Product Owner is in fact an Stakeholder, or if it is someone from the software company who assumes that role.  Points mentioned in said post included:     The primary role of a product owner is to represent the needs and desires of the stakeholder community to an agile delivery team   And yeah, we are perfectly clear on what (s)he does but not on where does (s)he comes from.  Does the Product Owner comes from the software company or from the customer?  In the particular case it can come from both parties, in the scenario where a customer has no idea about agile planning is it safe to assume the Product Owner will come from the software company? "
989,Tracking hours for Managers/Scrum Master,"Developers at my company log hours in JIRA. Managers/Scrum Masters do not log hours that religiously. They would only log for Scrum ceremonies.  As a manager, I can see the reason for not adding my Tasks to the Sprint, as meeting with stakeholders, helping team with technical difficulties, liaising with customers etc. are not good candidates for a developer Sprint. These cannot be planned nor groomed nor any such thing. And the Team doesn't need to know the details of these, as these are not the kind of Tasks any member should be able to do. Only I will be doing these Tasks and  while I can ask for feedback from my Team, we don't need to groom these Tasks as such.  We recently had a conversation with HR, about finding a way to log managers' work. We can obviously create JIRA Tasks for our work, but then, as it doesn't get added to the Sprint, it doesn't get counted for the amount of work completed for a particular project.  Can you please share any insight into how you are managing this at your company? Do we create a separate Sprint for managers, across projects? Or do we create a Story in each Sprint for each category of Tasks I do during the Sprint, as a manager? We do have 6-10 managers with varying Team sizes assigned to each of them. "
990,Earned Schedule Values,"On this particular project, the performance of the testing team is being tracked against the number of scenarios tested compared to the plan.  Using Earned Schedule analysis, the resulting values are calculated:   Earned Schedule (ES) = August 15 Actual Time (AT) = September 10    Independent EAC (IEACt) = November 6 Planned Time at Completion (TAC) = October 2 Schedule Performance Indicator (SPIt) = 0.84 To Complete SPI (using planned    EAC) = 2.28   Here's the graph (series 4 is the actual performance):    A TCSPI, like TCPI using Earned Value, greater than 1.10 is considered to be not credible, i.e., impossible.  Since our TCSPI is 2.28, recovery should be considered not possible and other alternatives should be considered.  This was presented to the team (not in a manner using a ton of ES technical babble but in a way for most others to understand), suggesting that recovery was unlikely (did not use the word impossible) and that other alternatives needed to be analyzed.  The testing team, developers, and other support personnel rejected this notion wholesale, indicating that recovery is not only possible but that they will recover, and dismissing the presented analysis as ""textbook.""  The alternative, more optimistic points of view had no basis behind it; it was just they thought was more true.  Others who were listening to this debate tended to lean towards the more optimistic opinions and the general consensus was to continue on and no other mitigating or contingency alternatives were explored.  My question is: why?  Why do we spend time learning the mechanics of various way to analyze data but then reject it in practice?  I have observed this chronically across many different types of projects and customers and teams.    There is not a ""right"" answer to my question so I know this violates the rules a bit, but I think a right answer sort of lives in the collective responses from all of you, those who live this every day.  I would like to hear your critical thoughts and opinions on this subject.  Thanks. "
991,Handle the same project over multiple platforms in Agile,"I'm working in a company that mainly perform mobile apps with their backend systems. My question is, what's the best practice to handle the same projects over multiple platforms (iOS and Android) and keep them synced together using Agile approach? Should I use a separate project to each one, or handle them in the same project with having duplicate User Stories for each platform? Or do we have another solution for that approach? "
992,"How can I suppress task type indicators for ""The task has a calendar applied to it.""",In an mpp file the owner has set a certain calendar and therefore that calendar setting is shown for every single task in the Indicators column.   Is it possible to exclude some indicators from being shown there? Maybe in the registry?  Question applies to Project 2003 but also to Project 2010. 
993,How to prevent top managers setting unrealistic expectations with a customer?,"Currently we're working on a project where top management is providing unrealistic estimates to our customers, especially in terms of the number of bugs that we can fix. We are not talking just about a optimistic targets, but clearly unrealistic goals like fixing 400 bugs a week instead of an average of 200 bugs. The main risks are that we will not take the action needed to really fix the project like renegotiating the plan, reducing the scope, etc.  I am thinking about different strategies here to overcome the problem:   Let the management focus on unrealistic goals while working-level people renegotiate planning and scope to find some real solutions. Directly raising this issue with client management (probably a bad idea). Wait until we really crash (e.g. fail to deliver what is expected) to implement a new solution.   Is there a better strategy to prevent such situations? Are there special tricks to deal with top management who get involved in project details? How can we deal with this situation? "
994,How can I reduce the amount of technical high risk work in projects?,"Typically, my projects involve a challenging technical problem. In my latest project this is a set of offline CRUD screens, which was scope creep of 50% of the total project estimate. I reviewed options, which were basically AngularJS and some offline library or building my own offline CRUD system. I opted for the latter, because I build my own CRUD system in the past and had negative experiences with technical limitations of fairly new libraries. My gut feeling is I was wrong. I'd like to reduce the amount of high risk work in current projects. Three options come to mind:   Use new technology in a hobby project only Find clients to pay for research work, maybe on a lower rate Do research work on open source projects I interact with   Has anyone used any of these three methods? What was your experience with it and which method would you recommend? "
995,Where is the Deming study that asserts most errors are in organization or process?,"Organization background: SW development team, painful level of bugs, little process (2 to 3 pts max on Joel Spolsky's 12-point test). I have hard time convincing the team that the organization is defective and not just ""devs are incompetent"".  I remember E. Deming's claim from his study that most (80%+?) problems originate in  process, methods and organization and not in workforce errors, but for the life of me I can't find it by googling. Does smbdy here know the study that is source of such claims? "
996,How to deal with scheduling/control when task insertion (vs task duration) is primary risk,"We're working on a project that has a considerable amount of task insertion risk (by which I mean either a) the insertion of new tasks into the WBS or b) the rearrangement of technical dependencies in the project network). Despite our best efforts on the WBS phase, we still find ourselves constantly revising the WBS/project network as we learn more about the domain.  My experience is with scheduling tools (e.g. PERT, Monte Carlo) that focus on task duration risk. I'm finding myself very poorly equipped to deal with constant changes to the WBS/project network themselves.  Are there more appropriate tools for me to use for scheduling/control in the presence of high task insertion risk? If so, what are they? I've taken a look at Critical Chain / Buffer Management but am not sure if this is the answer. "
997,What tools or processes help you to keep the bigger picture in mind?,"I am a product manager at a small startup. Naturally, we have very limited resources and a ton of fires to put out.  Now, when I start working on some specific area, I can easily craft hypotheses, experiment and improve. Additionally, I can imagine a vision and possible iterations for these isolated features.  Now, the issue is that I am not working on some isolated area anymore but need to keep the whole app in mind when I work:   I need to keep the overview over all parts of the app and how they interact with each other I need to prioritise features and hypotheses to test for different parts of the app All of these initiatives need to bring us closer to our vision   I am a bit overwhelmed and constantly feel like I lost the overview. How do you manage the product at a higher level, take a step back and zoom out of the day to day grind?   Are there processes, tools or routines that you use to make sure your next steps are a logical consequence of the vision you have for your product vs. just the next best feature that wins in the RICE score? "
998,Can QA test in-progress tasks? How are bugs reported for incomplete stories?,"I have recently been moved to a new team. There are a lot of practices that I think are not on terms with the Scrum Guide but for now I want to discuss two strange practices.   While we developers are working on tasks, the Quality Assurances people start testing them via as many scenarios they can think of; they then add any found issues as Bugs. Any sane person would say that this is wrong. If you think a developer might miss a case or scenario then you can add them in the task's description or create a sub task.    I raised this point with the QAs and the Agile Coach and the reply was that Scrum allows us to change certain things as we learn from experience, so we have introduced this thing. I want to know if this practice is right or wrong. I can't really do anything practical about it except raising the issue in the Retrospective.     Second question is about testing of completed tasks. A developer completes their tasks, let's say 4 days before the sprint's end. The QA finds a thing missing in implementation. Should it be reported as a Bug or the task should be reassigned to a developer, with a comment or edit in description and moved back to progress?   Right now, in our team, if QA finds a problem with task, they keep the tasks in testing but add a new Bug as sub and assign them to developer.   My question is: is this approach right? For example, there is a task to change the color of two buttons, one should now be green and other should be red. A developer works on this task, they first understand the task. How they should do this, use CSS or JavaScript (this is just a simple example, so please bear with me)? They change only one button, or forget to change other button, or change both but due to bad coding only one gets changed. Now the developer moves this task to testing, QA tests the task, and finds that only one button is changed. Now should the issue sent back to developer or a Bug should be reported?   If the issue is returned, the developer already knows how to change the color, they will fix the problem, it will be quick. If a bug is reported and the bug gets assigned to a different developer, the it will be a waste of time. The new developer will have to see how to better do the task. A missing semicolon might be the reason.   Now my question is: what is the better approach for the above two cases?   "
999,Factors to consider for Merging two or more IT Operations team into ONE,"   I believe this question falls under a Project from the Management   side.      But I would appreciate any help or resources for the scenario. The   project as an IT Manager, is responsible for merging IT operations   team(approx 2-4 employees) of 4 sister companies, into One IT   OPERATION TEAM.      Challenges here are:         How do I calculate the cost per employee for the company since, there are some    similarities in the nature of work they do? Like for   example, supporting Exchange, Level 3 support, etc...   Is there a Model which I can refer to or any sources that I should read through before moving ahead?      I did go through resources from the management side, which include the following:   Mergers and Acquisitions:  Best Practices for  Successful Integration Successful Post-Merger Integration: Realizing the Synergies The Role of IT  in Successful  Merger Integration   But was checking if I am in the right direction, or need to consider more resources.  Any help/suggestions/comments regarding the same will be highly appreciated. "
1000,How do you ensure your code does not get stolen when working with a remote contractor?,"Recently in order to expand our products, we have had to bring in external contractors, especially those working remotely. Some of the tasks involve porting an existing application on one platform to another.  In order to effectively port some of these applications, sharing existing code with the contractor is inevitable. Yet, this is the most risk taking things of all. How do you share code / your livelihood, with a contractor and ensure it's not misused or recreated in another project? All I know, they could cancel the contract after a few weeks and go on and develop their own app using the stolen code.  I realize vetting and interviewing trust worthy candidates is the first step, but after having done that, what steps can be taken to ensure your code is safe from being reproduced illegally? "
1001,I need help finding a problem to research and solve for HS research project,"Short version: I want to do a research project, but for the life of me I cannot think of an original problem to solve that isn't already being solved. (also for the record, if I am in the wrong discussion website, please point me towards the proper one in which to voice my question)  This semester at my High School I will be taking a class titled Problems and Solutions in which I will have a semester to identify and research a problem in a field that interests me, solve the problem via experimentation and the scientific method, and then present my findings.  I began by scouring news, fields, other's research in an attempt to isolate a problem that I could solve.  Finding, or rather coming up with, a problem has proved difficult for me, although I (tentatively) narrowed my fields of interest down to the following:  Better solar power, Wireless solar power transmission from altitude, Communication network for autonomous vehicles, Aeroelasticity?, Solar Sail Elasticity?, Desalination? Of groundwater (Solar?), Quantum Tunneling? (not really realistic research for a 10th grader, just a cool topic),         and EEg Prosthetics                                                            These are not in anyway what I plan to limit myself if a better project presents itself, just specifics that I came up with.  I was wondering if you could give me advice for finding a problem to solve in these (or any fields, I'm interested in a lot), link some examples, or even point me towards some research that I could build upon.   Also, I forgot to mention that in the 'fields of interest' that I have narrowed down to I have read quite a bit about the research being done concerning each one, such as research on Eeg Prosthetic algorithms or Google's work in the neural networks of self driving cars. I thought that being knowledgable on the subjects would allow me to find a problem but I only found what already has been solved.   I really appreciate your help "
1002,Handling New Issues in the backlog,"We are a small team mostly focused on medium to large scale websites.  I am going to merge all issues for all of our projects into one backlog using Kanban with JIRA. The idea being that no one gets to pick and choose what they want to work on, but rather we can prioritize everything that the company needs to do and everyone will work on their next ticket in the que.     This will lead to hundreds of tasks in my backlog.  I'm fine with this when it comes initially importing all the tasks for a project and prioritizing everything.  However my quandary is as new issues are created by the team (through testing or just new things that come up) and go into my backlog what is the most efficient way for me to handle these without loosing track of what items I need to prioritize? Do I prioritize those right away? daily prioritize new items? have them go to some pre-qualified status to help me easily see what are new issues that need be entered into the backlog? or some other method that someone far wiser than I has already developed?   thanks for any help.  Backstory if it's helpful:  We are a team of 8.  In the past we have had a serious issues with handling projects separately as well as new projects separated from ongoing support for current clients.  Obviously there has been zero true project management. Thus leading to the person who is responsible for ongoing clients to yell about their tickets be priority and likewise for the person trying to coordinate our new projects to scream that developers should be working on those first.  Thankfully we are fixing that. Since I've been the most vocal about it, I get to play PM.  I don't want to just play PM though. I'm doing my best to study many methods, read on here, and learn from others.  I've chosen Kanban because I think it helps keep the flow going (there's always a flow of issues in our team), easily see what's the priority across the company, handles efficiency and resources with WIP limits, and makes sure that everyone knows what is the next thing they should be working on.

1003,MS Project - Summary Task split by leveling,"I have a summary task, and have the 'Leveling Can Split' option set to No. The four subtasks which are in sequence, also have LCS set to No. In the Leveling options I also have 'Leveling can create splits in remaining work' unchecked. The tasks are all Priority 500. I have had to insert a factory shutdown, and I have done this by creating a Priority 1000 task which uses the resources in each of the above tasks.  I believed the logic should be that the LCS set to No on the summary task would force all four tasks to run sequentially either before or after the shutdown. But the leveler, allows two tasks to be before the shutdown, and two after, with the delay being the span of the shutdown task.  Can anyone advise on whether I am doing this wrong, or if the summary task cannot be prevented from splitting in this manner? I am at a loss, the summary task has an input field to say the task cannot be split, but there it is split in the schedule. Any suggestions in how to keep these subtasks together?  Thanks,  Declan "
1004,What software quality KPIs do you use?,"I need to define the KPIs which will help me to say if software coming out from the project is good or bad. I mean does it fulfill quality KPIs which were targeted or not. The question of course is what KPIs can be defined for software development project. What quality KPIs do you use in your software development projects? How you interpret them? Thank you all in advance for help!  For Change management in my project we use MS Team Foundation Server 2010. All processes are very loosely based on CMMI. The project is similar to SAP. We have a modules which are the core of the system, lower levels are common for smaller parts of stakeholders or customize. We are working in a mode of support of current released system versions (fixing bugs, adding users etc.) and also creating new futures. The project is web application.  We work for internal client. "
1005,distinguishing between impediments and risks,"To me they both seem to be issues that negatively impact the project. So how to tell the difference? When identifying these 'issues', how do project managers determine whether or not it is a risk or an impediment? What are some real world examples of each and why they are categorized as risks or impediments? "
1006,"questions around ""standups"" for remote team","I have been working as a software developer for more than a decade. Recently I took a new job where I have to manage a remote team of 5 developers.  We have a ""stand up"" conference call every day at 5pm my time, 10 am their time. (I am the team lead/manager and will be the scrum master as well)  I have some questions:   how to call the meeting? ""stand up?"", ""huddle?"", other? I have worked in some places where before the scrum meeting the scrum master touches on latest news (political, technology, etc). Should I do the same? should I be the first or last to talk in the status presentation? what other points should I cover? are there any books on this subject?   Cheers! "
1007,Frontend/backend feature team with little shared knowledge,"We are considering creating a feature team with three frontend/UX developers and a few backend developers (no full stack developer). I would like to know whether putting them together in a cross-functional team makes sense if the two groups share very little knowledge and technology stacks.  My understanding is that the benefits of a cross-functional feature team lie in helping people better deliver customer value by   team helping each other to get things done keeping focus on the feature with common backlog and low total WIP reducing hand-offs etc.   If the frontendists have JavaScript-based stack, the backendists Java-based stack and share little knowledge and technology, it may seem the above points are not satisfied:   the two groups cannot help each so much due to little shared knowledge and unidirectional dependencies the two groups frequently get out of sync because, e.g., designs for new features must be prepared in advance; this leads to high total WIP  because of the out-of-sync problem and unidirectional dependencies, there are still hand-offs, just hidden inside the team   Separating the teams smells with waterfall, but does joining the two groups together in a team outweigh the cost in this case?  Does it make sense to separate the frontend team and perhaps make the backend part more cross-functional towards the core of the system instead?   Do you have successful experience with frontend+backend teams without full-stack developers (or teams with little shared knowledge in general)?  Thanks "

1009,Should a team leader/project manager be a public speaker,"From my experience I can see that Project Manager/Team Leader is often responsible for many tasks not directly connected with his day to day job. For example he often takes part in sales meetings. On the other hand he has to persuade his team or his supervisors to some decisions and ideas. In many different situations he is speaking in front of the audience, which can be small but can contain decisive people from higher job positions than his own.   Should a project manager spend some time sharpening his public speaking skills? What is the best way to do it? "
1010,Jira Sprint Structure for Software Team,"As I see it, we have three levels:  Epic - Broad view of what would be nice to do. (Usually more then a Sprint)   Let pay for our service with credit cards   Story - More defined and structured view. (What can be done in a Sprint)   Let people pay at website Let people pay at mobile app   Task - story that broken down to Components (Backend, DB, Frontend, iOS, etc) (What can be done in a day)  Let people pay at website   Create a landing page Create REST service for payments*   Let people pay at mobile app   Create a button in mobile app Create REST service for payments*   (* - same ticket)  There is a way to create an Epic in Jira. And we can add Stories to Epics. We can't break every Story to Tasks to have a nice structure. But as I understand, there's a common path. It's to create sub-tasks for Stories. What difference will it be from Tasks itself? And then we can take these Stories to our Sprint with a board's backlog spring-creating feature. BUT.   At the Planning, should we estimate Task or a Story? Every video that I've seen has estimated a Story. But how we can estimate Story by itself if it takes different components ie Database, Web Frontend, Mobile app? This is different people and different Tasks. Wouldn't it be more logical to estimate Tasks and then summarize their estimation for a Story? If we creating sub-tasks to a story and taking whole Stories into our Sprint. What will happen if we will fail to complete whole Story to the end of the Sprint. Meaning, Story has 10 story point and equals three sub-tasks with 1,3,5 points. We closed two sub-tasks with 3 and 5. Will we be planning the next Sprint with a Story of 10 or 1 point?  "
1011,Microsoft Project: How to make two resources work at the same time on the same task when using automatic resource leveling?,"In Microsoft Project I have a task with these attributes:   Duration = 0.5 days Resources = Person A[100%]; Person B[100%] Type = Fixed Duration Effort driven = No (implying Level Assignments = No)   When I start Resource Leveling (with ""Leveling can adjust individual assignments on a task"" = No), the duration of the task will be increased because Microsoft Project schedules the assignment the following way: Person A starts to work at 08:00 and finishes at 12:00. Person B starts to work at 13:00 and finishes at 17:00.  I actually need to have the two persons working together at the same time.  How can I tell Microsoft Project to schedule the assignments of the two persons to have the same time start and finish times? (When doing automatic resource leveling.)

1013,software process model for one person with requirments well defined upfront,"a project developed by just one person that have all the requirements well defined upfront which is the best process model for a cms project? Im in doubt between agile or waterfall. I read that waterfall is ok for projects where the requirements are well defined and is not probably that will change, and it is the case, but also i read that are a lot of disadvantages. But also agile it seems that its more for teams with 2 or more people so maybe its not appropriate.  Do you know more clearly which criteria should we have in account to know which is the best process model? "
1014,How to generate a lead time report in JIRA without a plugin?,"Has anyone compiled a lead time report (in any format) from JIRA without the use of a plug-in?    If so, how did you do it?   The native Control Chart tracks cycle time but not individual times for statuses or columns.  I found some documentation from JIRA but it is several years old.  If the only option is to export to XLS and interrogate the data then I am happy with that but would prefer a native solution.  "
1015,How to describe the business entities in Scrum?,"Every (software) project comes with business entities: ""Article"" and ""Category"" for a blog, ""Product"", ""Customer"" and ""Invoice"" for a shop, etc.   These  business  entities are part of many user-stories : one to describe the creation/update form, one for the detail screen, one for the back-office screen, and much more.  In a non-agile project, you describe all these entities in the specifications, but in Scrum there is no such thing.   So, how do you write all these users-stories ? Do you repeat all the properties and relations each time?   Examples:   As an admin, I can add an ""Article"" with a title, a content, one or more Category. As a user, I can see the title, content and the Categories of an Article ...   What do you think? "
1016,How can I improve this Jira process?,"At the moment in Jira each developer has the following columns in its dashboard:  (developer dashboard)  TO DO       IN PROGRESS     IMPEDED     QA  REVIEW      DONE  Story 101 -----------------------------------------------------------------------------            Development  Story 102 -----------------------------------------------------------------------------                                               Development   Each developer can create a certain number of tasks for each story. One task for each story is created for testing and assigned to the tester from the beginning.  The tester has the following dashboard:  (tester dashboard) TO DO       IN PROGRESS     IMPEDED     QA  REVIEW      DONE  Story 101 -----------------------------------------------------------------------------   Test   When the story is ready for testing the developer move the testing task to the QA column (although he cannot see it from its dashboard).   (tester dashboard) TO DO       IN PROGRESS     IMPEDED     QA  REVIEW      DONE  Story 101 -----------------------------------------------------------------------------                                         Test   The developer has to rely on notifications sent via email, when a test fail and the testing task is assigned back to ""in progress"" (the testing task is never assigned to the developer):  (tester dashboard) TO DO       IN PROGRESS     IMPEDED     QA  REVIEW      DONE  Story 101 -----------------------------------------------------------------------------                Test   In addition to this, for reviews the process is not very linear, as the task is not assigned to the reviewer but just moved to the column REVIEW:  (developer dashboard) TO DO       IN PROGRESS     IMPEDED     QA  REVIEW      DONE  Story 101 -----------------------------------------------------------------------------                                             Development   There might be multiple reviewers and the only way to know you have to review a story is to login to Bitbucket and see if there are any pull requests. When somebody leaves comments, you have to constantly check the pull request to deal with the comments.  Another problem here is that the tester not always waits for the review to be completed (approved by everybody in the pull request). In fact the ""development"" task can be in ""review"" state and at the same time the ""testing"" task can be in the QA state. The tester sometimes start testing before the end of the review because there are no other stories to be tested, but the consequence is that he has to test again if there are any changes to the code.  As you can see the process is quite convoluted and not linear. How can I improve the process? what are we doing wrong? "
1017,Firm Fixed Price Contracts and Binding the Work,"For scope that is reasonably explicit, many customers choose to purchase services under a firm fixed price contract in order to remove cost risk.  It is essentially transferring risk to the seller as a risk course of action.  For this luxury, customers can typically pay a multiple somewhere between 10% to maybe as high as 50% than they would have paid under a different type of contract where cost risk is still borne by them.  Under this scenario, the seller now holds this risk.  If they performed a proper probabilistic estimate on the work and conducted a thorough risk analysis, the seller would likely target and price more conservatively and capture in the price contingent dollars for unknowns.    How can work be bound such that there is a point where the seller's loss can be stopped?  If the seller estimates between 12 and 25 cycles of work to produce the widget, most likley 15, and the seller conservatively targets and prices 18 cycles of work, would there be a way to include in the contract that anything above 20 cycles would require a change request?  If you had a stop loss for the seller, would it not be fair to have a stop loss for the buyer, e.g., if cycles only took 11, 12, or 13, the buyer gets a discount?  Or is it that, once a FFP is agreed upon, the seller has the risk no matter what and the only ""stop loss"" mitigators would be explicit finish criteria, firm buyer obligations, and a strong risk process?  Answer this question under the assumption that scope is under control and that changes to scope causes a change in both schedule and price; that the buyer's obligations are being met in full, meaning the increased cycles in work cannot be tied to something the buyer is or is not doing; and in an industry agnostic way.  Thanks! "
1018,How to select a good Project Documents generation solution?,"Within duration of project I often have to communicate various things to the clients. The projects I'm working on are very flexible, so often I receive from the client set of changes to implement and I estimate, provide and report on them. The forms of the documents sent back and forth are similar, but are not the same. Currently, I create those manually which I find very tedious, time-consuming and error prone.  I tried iReport but think it's overkill for the task and requires more effort for learning and using than it is worth.  I want to eliminate risk of inconsistency in the documents that I send out to clients. Also, if I keep all the data within spreadsheets and generate documents on the fly using a document-generator, will that be a good solution to this problem?  What is a good desktop-based solution to this problem? "
1019,How can I plan a project that has undefined scope associated with learning new skills?,"The client has set (and we have agreed to) the deadline for a project. In order to complete the project, the team needs to master a new tool chain including Selenium and Java.    How do I establish a plan for an agile project that includes both learning the software and delivering the customer value? For example, how do I scope work that is intrinsically unknown (e.g. ""learn selenium""), and how do I mitigate the risks that arise from not knowing the software well enough to accurately estimate the work? "
1020,How can I effectively split a team into smaller teams?,"There's a lot research on team sizes and communication in social groups, but is there any research on how to grow and build multiple teams working on one large product?  Assuming that the ""perfect"" team size is 5+-2, how do you choose to break a team that just reached 9 or 10 people into two teams? That is, what would the second team's responsibilities be, how would communication stay fluid?  Edit:  I guess I didn't word that very well at all...  So! I don't have a framework or structure at this point in time. What I was trying to say is that there is a lot of deep research into team size ([website]But what I'm curious is about how much research is there on business size. That being, the number of teams and communicating between them. The next step after setting team sizes if you will.  Examples of team size and social connections that I'm talking about are...

1021,Jira Agile how to specify what branch or version an improvement or story goes in so it's less confusing?,"How should I handle telling our developers where to put the changesm wether it be a bug or new feature using JIRA?  Here is why I ask:  For Issues/Bugs I think the use of the Affects and Fix version fields are a no brainier. If fix version is 2.5, I know the code needs to go into the 2.5 branch.  However, to me the wording at least doesn't fit these fields for stories and improvements. An improvement could affect a future version but it doesn't ""Fix"" something.  Using the fields differently between bugs and improvements seems like a bad idea too? I think this would be confusing to the users?  Here is an example of what I mean:   Bug/Issue: set Fix version to the versions you want this bug to fix. Story/Improvement: set the Affects version to where you would like this new feature to go.   For both of these scenarios, you are saying where to put the code. Using different fields, and if you want to start spelling out where the bug exists (version 1 and 2 but not 1.5) you then use both fields for a bug and one differently for an improvement.  How should I specify what branch or version an improvement or story goes in so it's less confusing? "
1022,Can a company follow Agile and ISO?,"Can a company follow agile and quality management hand in hand? Because Agile says focus on people instead of processes and tools, be flexible, focus on minimizing documentation, etc.   But a quality management process, like ISO, says to focus on process, standardize everything, document all records, etc. There are many conflicts between both methodologies.  So can a company following Agile implement and get quality certifications?  "
1023,Famous projects using Scrum,"As some of you know now, I'm trying to introduce Scrum in our company. Our CEO asked me if famous projects and/or big companies used the method. I found some companies, that's easy (Google, Yahoo, Microsoft, Facebook, Adobe, Nokia, Siemens, BBC, CNN, General Electric, Bank of America, Novell, Unisys...). Google maintains a list of companies using Scrum here. But which famous projects use Scrum? That's not so easy. Do you know some? "
1024,"Kanban: A cure for what ails me, or snake oil du jour?","I manage a team of developers and testers that makes widgets.  We manage several dozen widgets; in addition to creating new widgets, we have to update old ones with new functionality and fix urgent bugs.  The team is understaffed, overworked and burnt out, which of course is never good.  I'm intrigued by kanban for several reasons: (1) People only work on one thing at a time (2) Work in progress is minimized (3) Useful metrics can be extracted.  However, I see five stumbling blocks of varying criticality for my potential use case.   I can't find much information on how to deal with deadlines under kanban, and we have many deadlines.  A Sochi Olympics widget wouldn't have been useful if it was released after the olympics started.  How do you manage deadlines under kanban? I can't find much information on dealing with tasks of hugely varying sizes.  If all we were doing was fixing up bugs and adding small new features, things would be fine.  But the aforementioned example of the new Sochi widget takes significantly more time to develop than a bug fix to an existing widget; while it can be broken down somewhat, there are still several very large tasks that need to be done before anything remotely workable is ready.  How do you prevent large projects from ""clogging"" your pipeline? How does kanban work if the ""swim lanes"" have differing priorities?  If there's a high priority ""swim lane"" for customer-reported bugs, how does one ensure that the right person temporarily drops one task and moves to the high priority task? The pipelines that I usually see have a ""Development"" column and a ""Testing"" column.  But if you wait until development of a feature is done before testing begins, you could really drag out the cycle.  Should development of tests be tasks of their own, so that they can get started in parallel with development of widgets?  If so, this distinction may not always be understood by the project managers who fill the backlog... and therefore doesn't seem to fit cleanly into the kanban model of popping single tasks out of the backlog. If multiple tasks are sitting around in different ""Done"" columns, and a developer or tester gets freed up, how does one determine which task gets pulled out of the ""Done"" column?  Does kanban treat all tasks within a swim lane as equal in priority, thus leaving it up to the developer which one he wants to pull?   I know some of these questions are elementary, but don't seem to be fleshed out completely in some of the free documentation available.  Thanks in advance for any feedback. "
1025,What to do If client set the deadline for tasks in software development?,"What to do if the client which you work for gives you tasks as well as deadline for those tasks, without compromising on time and budget?

This is my first time doing the work of a project manager. I also have to mention that the arrangement is, the compensation will be upon completion of the project, we're already on our 1 1/2 months and the output of the developers are declining. We all have day jobs, and we're doing this part-time (4 hours a day) after our day job.  The questions are:   How should the manager motivate the team? How should a manager handle ""I'm so tired from my previous work, can't work right now"" type of statements from the developers? How should a manager push to keep the tasks moving? What project management style should the manager apply in this setup? What software development methodology / life cycle best fits this setup?  "
1027,How to manage sprint velocity when someone does both design & development?,"Background  I work at a startup where I'm the only designer (UI/UX/Visual), however, we don't have an actual front-end developer, so most of the HTML/CSS development also falls on me as I'm half-decent at that as well. We have a web app which I and development maintain, but we also have a marketing website that I'm basically the sole maintainer of and I do other design work for marketing as well.   We have a product owner that helps prioritize our backlog, but we don't currently have a scrum master unfortunately, so we're trying to follow a more ""program manager"" route until we're able to hire one.  We currently practice scrum for our development team, but we're running into issues with trying to figure out how to project velocity since I'm technically apart of 3 different teams—development, design, and marketing.   Question  How do you account for someone that is a part of multiple teams? I realize Scrum by the book says this really shouldn't happen, but when a company doesn't have enough resources, then a person will get shared on multiple teams.   I've seen answers that say you should basically group together people with a certain skill set (such as design or system architects) and have them be a completely different team that has their own sprint where a lot of their tasks will cover work for different teams. Since I'm only one person, that seems a bit overkill, but I can't think of any other possible solutions.   The biggest issue I'm having is trying to make my design process be truly agile as scoring a design can become extremely problematic. Sometimes a design will be approved the first time, but other times it'll take 5 iterations. The only thought I had was to maybe re-score every time I have to do an iteration &amp; bump it to the top of my sprint since that's still technically my priority? Either way, it makes forecasting design to be really hard and if I can't have semi-accurate story points for design, it becomes impossible to say how many points can be allocated doing front-end development stories for the development team project if a design story ends up taking forever due to multiple iterations.  I've heard solutions before that say devote ""X percent"" to this team &amp; the rest to the other, but the main issue with that is that my time gets drastically shifted from being design-heavy one week to code-heavy the next. So the idea of trying to allocate a certain amount of time to each team just doesn't practically work out.  I would say the work I do shouldn't actually affect the development team, but it currently does affect their work load as they are the ones that do code reviews &amp; test each ticket since I'm only a team of one and can't review my own work. So kind of at a loss for what to do here as I've currently just been jumping from design to coding primarily just based on what I deem to be more important at the moment, which isn't exactly ideal.  Related question: Is it possible for someone to be a member of two Scrum teams, and how can that be made to work most effectively? "
1028,How to implement scrum on an Waterfall enterprise?,"Research prior to asking this questions -> When to Use Waterfall, When to Use Scrum ?  I am not focus on pure waterfall vs pure scrum conversion. I am more incline of solving the following problems that are being caused by our very rigid waterfall implementation. As everything in big corporations, there is a little of fault in red tape and additional politics, but at heart of the problem is the Waterfall methodology that we currently follow.   Here are the symptoms:   Business Requirements have very little quality since they hand-off these requirements at the beginning meeting a date for IT to start the software analysis. This frustrates the IT teams and use some of the development time to clear some of these bad requirements.  Because Business requirements are not completed on time or have little quality, development usually develops the wrong thing, causing re-work.  Because rework is necessary, and changes are unavoidable the QA team usually end up without the time to do proper work. In order to get anything in a release we have to estimate without requirements, this causes a list of things that the business wants but is unattainable because time to develop is inflated (mainly politics issue)   This department of 40-50 IT pros, have been trying to step out of waterfall into scrum for a year now, but is causing a lot of issues. Issues like (1) people using scrum to hide on the fact that requirements are not ready (2) other IT departments that don't use scrum complain about the process.  I have decided to try a 12 weeks scrum pilot. Shoot for a strict scrum implementation where that team will have a product owner that will be responsible for what is important. I think this will be the key of having a successful implementation. Right now the business is not accountable for their deliveries, and I think they should be. I will split these 12 weeks in 3 sprints of 3 weeks with 2 weeks of planning the pilot and 1 week of releasing to production.   The questions: In your experience - is there a MUST DO before I try this pilot with a very large organization? "
1029,When is the best time to create story tasks?,"I have a team of developers who are relatively new to Agile and sprints (approx. 5 months now).  Every time I walk into their sprint planning session, I do not like what I see.  It's absolute silence and we can practically hear ourselves breathing.  The SM is the only person talking and tries to create tasks, one-by-one, for each story.  I try to encourage the PO and developers to ask questions, but I have developers who are very ""passive"" (not pro-active).  No developer will voluntarily request to be assigned a task (like I use to do and have seen done by so many of my peers).  They sit and almost wait to be assigned tasks (which was how it was before I introduced Agile).  Our sprint planning sessions are WAY too long (almost a full day) for a two week sprint.  There is a lot of wasted time discussing things that should probably have been ironed out before the session by the PO.  My questions are as follows:   Other than a backlog grooming session, is there a formal meeting where the SM, PO, and I can pre-populate the tasks for each story?    We know we will need certain tasks, such as:   unit tests functional tests load tests test strategy meetings design    If such a meeting exists, what is it called? If not, would this, in any way, go against the Agile methodology?      How can I get developers more involved?  I want them to be pro-active, ask questions, give opinions, to fight for tasks.   What can I do for motivation?      Any recommendations on what the PO could do prior to a sprint planning session?    I just want all the boilerplate work to be done before developers and others join the session.  Having everyone sit through several minutes per story watching the SM create and name tasks, set the JIRA fields, etc. is entirely counter-productive.  "
1030,What is the best workflow between Jira and Confluence?,"I'm struggling with Jira and Confluence.  My Team and I are developing an application and we are not sure how to structure our JIRA environment perfectly. For our development process we use Kanban.   Now, for each App (Android, iOS, Web and the back-end) we have separate projects in JIRA. So we have to create each epic and story 4 times. This is not very efficient.  Is it better to create one Project in JIRA e.g. ""Software Project"" and create there several boards for each app in it?  Is it right to start by creating a Product Requirement in Confluence, define there our User Story and create these stories in JIRA?  I mean every App has the same epics and stories but the have different Tasks. How do we manage this?  What is the perfect structure in JIRA and the best Workflow between Confluence and JIRA for our workflow? We are looking forward to using Portfolio. Is it recommendable? "
1031,What are you doing with Agile teams who no longer run retrospectives?,"I have run into several teams who tell me that they no longer run iteration retrospectives: they were a waste of time and they weren't learning anything new. What is your answer to these teams? Should they just let go of the need to have retrospectives? If not, how do you convince them of the value of the retrospective? "
1032,Who owns the issue of Agile team complacency?,I am really eager to hear different perspectives on team complacency about their Agile adoption. Is it the ScrumMaster's problem? The team's issue? The manager's fault? I can see so many complex webs here. I'd love to know what you think. 
1033,Who is using Cynefin for their Agile adoption?,I've listened to some David Snowden podcasts on complexity theory and the Cynefin framework.

What guidance can you give me about strengths and weaknesses of applying the framework in an Agile rollout/adoption? 
1034,How to get a customer to deliver the needed ressources as quick as possible,"We are a pretty young Startup who helps offline retailers to get their products successful online and we also take care of anything else, like shipping etc.  Also the customers are very eager after our meeting to provide us with the data we need to get started ( only a list with EAN-Codes and buy prices of the retailers for their products ) we have to call them up several times and make sure, we do not lose connection. Which stops us from get started making money and running his business, because we need this list in the first place to get started.  We thought about taking a fee in the beginning so the customers is actually more bounded to us. But we are curios if there is not any better idea? How can we make sure, the customer actually wants to give as his list as quick as possible? "
1035,What estimation method do you use?,"In our organization, we mainly use Use Case estimation for new use cases which is very clear and simple. However we sometimes deal with tasks that are not related to Use Cases or are UI related or sometimes we deal with maintenance tasks in legacy application that we do not have written Use Cases of. So we developed an in-house method using complexity points for these tasks. It simply categorizes tasks into scale from very simple to very complex according to a guideline and give every scale a size. We calculated a conversion coefficient to convert between UCP (use Case Points) and CP (complexity points) in case the project used both methods. In our organization the PM usually have technical background to do the estimation. S/he may consult the team if needed.  I want to know more about other people experience.  What size estimation method(s) do you use/recommend (Use Case Point, Function Point, Class Point, ...) ? Or do you estimate effort directly? Who does the estimation in your project (PM, Team, Estimation committee like in Delphi method, ...)?  Most importantly please tell us about a situation where your method failed and why do you think this happened. "
1036,"In an agile process, should there be PMs in agile in the first place?

How does a Project Manager&#39;s job change when transitioning from waterfall to Agile?   In an agile process, where should PMs stand? What exactly is their Role? Should there be PMs in agile in the first place? Or Should they be replaced by a PO (Product Owner), or -may be- a Scrum Master?   That's a question that really confuses me a lot.. I can't give a definite answer.. Should they replace POs.. Hmm. I guess not.. On one hand, a PO should be the one directing the project, knowing what the customer want.. But still, a PO -probably- should have some technical background.. So according to my answer to the previous question, PMs can't replace POs.. On the other hand, Replacing a Scrum Master, is a bit too far for PMs, Scrum Master are supposed to be in favor of the development team, ie a facilitator &amp; protector for the dev team; &amp; PMs are notorious of failing to do so.. :D Another option -that just came to me right now- is PMs replacing customer in environments where it's difficult to involve the customer.

1037,"What is an impediment, and how to handle them and internal improvments in Scrum?","What exactly is an impediment? I know that Scrum say that and impediment is something that stop the team from performing the best it can. So basically it can be everything? But where goes the magical line where it becomes and internal improvement?  For example. We want to have more realistic test data in our databases, is that internal improvement or impediment? We as a team could try to solve it in the sprint along with the other stories directly, or we could say that it's an internal improvement that needs to be a story and go into the product backlog.  As I see it we have three options:   Handle all internal improvements as stories in the backlog and make the PO prioritize them.  Work with them along regular stories in the sprint.  Big things goes in as stories and small stuffs we can do directly in the sprint without it effecting the velocity much.   Which is the correct option?  "

1039,Gameification - How would you gameify work in an Agile team?,"During a recent open session at RallyON 2011 we talked about paradoxes in Agile. One of the items that came up during the conversation is when a high-performing team becomes so well greased that all the ""agile-ness"" has been sucked from the process. When introducing NEW change to the well-oiled Scrum team, they balk because things are going so well...  A way to keep learning going, we talked briefly about ""gameification of work"" in an Agile team. Has anyone done this before? What are ways to keep an Agile team fresh? "
1040,A User Story that crosses components,"I'm having a hard time reconciling stories that have a concrete user value and that can be estimated when crossing component boundaries. Assume I own a Game application and have the following user story:  As a User I want to know which friends I have invited  so that I don't invite the same friend twice to play this game.   Pretty simple with a clear user value. This game already allows you to invite friends but it doesn't track friends you've already invited. This story asks for that. Now this is a mobile app that connects to a server using REST.   So the problem is that the engineering tasks break into two pretty small tasks. The server needs to make a schema change to track which friends of a user have been invited. The mobile app needs to utilize this to ensure the same friend is not invited more than once.   Also, for fun, assume this is a remotely distributed team and two different resources will be doing the tasks. One that does the Objective-C part and another for the Java server code.  Also assume that will not be pairing on the entire story.   So my question is how do most people handle this? There are two different estimates and two different tasks to complete but only one logical story. I only want to track the story. But the estimate (I guess) is the greater of both. If I only put the story into something like Pivotal Tracker then each developer cannot mark the work done as it completes. If I break the story into TWO stories then I have engineering work in my backlog and NOT customer value?   This seems so simple but for some reason I am getting stuck on it, dunno why. As a product owner I want to track the features but since two developers need to work to develop the feature I can't figure out the best way to represent this in pivotal tracker.  "
1041,Patent Application Development Artifacts,"From the inventor perspective that has a patent-attorney-team developing a nonprovisional patent application, I am trying to put together a plan comprising a list of deliverables (to be produce by patent attorneys), each with an estimated date. Although I have project management experience, I do not have patent application experience (first attempt at a patent).    Deliverables are workproducts and artifacts produced by stakeholders.  Questions   Is there a good list of Non Provisional Patent Application artifacts / deliverables?    How can I gauge progress with a looming deadline (April 2019)?   I have found the USPTO Patent Application Checklist, however, I think I should be focused on the claims and how they are progressing between now and the final draft? "
1042,Are inefficient/missing tools an impediment and is it the Scrum master's duty to improve them?,"In Scrum, the Scrum master's duty is to ""remove impediments"". I think I understand what this means in terms of organizational and coaching issues. I understand that the SM watches the devs' backs and keeps disturbances from outside the team away.  But, similar to this question, I don't fully understand what it means with respect to internal and (development) process related issues.   Is it or can it be a Scrum Master's responsibility to:   setup/improve a code review software system? setup/improve the continuous integration process? provide scripts/macros/helper tools to make the development process easier/more efficient ?  "
1043,How is Risk Management in Agile Development Different From Risk Management in Waterfall Model?,"In a typical project lifecycle, as a manager you are expected to have a risk plan which (please correct me if I'm wrong) consists of identifying, assessing and prioritizing all potential risks of the project.  However, I don't understand how these things are done in Agile development since many people say it is implicitly managed.   So if that's the case, then does that mean during the lifecycle of an Agile project, there is no risk planning? I'm confused as to how this all works. Or more specifically, how does the entire area of Risk compare with traditional and agile development? "
1044,Beginner certification to enter into project management,I am looking for project management entry level certification. I searched online and I found CAPM and PRINCE 2. I am bit confused which one should I go for.  Which one is worth doing??  
1045,"Does it make sense to require developers to write a ""business value add"" section in each issue?","Background  In our company we demand that engineers write a brief one liner section in each ticket they work on (from jira/github/gitlab etc) that explains the ""business requirement"".. the logic of that is explained here (text copied from our ""issue protocol"" document verbatim):     Business Value add      The software projects we work on must always   ultimately serve a business need. Simply put b/c at the end of the   day, someone should be paying for the development of these tasks.   Therefore, it's very important to express the value add of the task in   a language that non-technical person can understand and appreciate.      Think about it in the following scenario: we bill the client per issue   (ie in the monthly invoice we add the issue number and description in   a spreadsheet). For the client to know where their money is going,   they should be able to read the issue business requirement and   immediately understand it. This isn't the job of the PM on the   project, this is the job of the engineer working on the issue as   they're the one most familiar with it. If you need help expressing the   business value of the technical work you're doing, contact your PM and   they can give you a hand.      Business Value add instructions      Must be a one liner      don’t write a   whole detailed description of the requirement and the reason behind it   and the background etc. Simply state the business value of what the   task is about.       Must be a parent task      No need to write business requirements for   subtasks. The business requirement for the subtasks can be inferred   from the parent task      Must explain the business value add, not just describe a problem      People don’t pay engineers to report a problem. They pay them to fix   it. That’s why the business value add section should simply state the   value added by doing it.      Bad example Users won't be able to successfully checkout using valid   credit cards.      Good Example  Fix bug preventing using from successfully checking out   by using valid credit cards      Must use the imperative mood      This is best explained here. Similar to   the git commit messages, business value should be written in   imperative mood, which is “spoken or written as if giving a command or   instruction”. A few examples: Clean your room Close the door Take out   the trash Please see above link for more thorough explanation   I have used this policy with several teams/startups with mixed results. But I was going over the book Software Requirements and it showed this image:    and it shows ""business requirements"" as high level business objectives that belong in the vision and scope document, rather than ""functional requirements specification"" doc.   Question  Does it make sense to ask engineers to put a Business Value Add section in each issue they work on? Let's assume that engineers aren't trained for that kind of documentation (from my own experience, it's a hit or miss chance that engineers will be able to properly write a business requirement section, most of the time they do it just as getting through the motions and they don't really do a good job) then the next question is: does it make sense for anyone to write a business requirement section for each issue.. be it a BA or a PM etc?  Update  I just wanted to clarify something. Basically I guess my question makes more sense if given the context that the engineers doing the work are not from the same organization that's paying for the work. Classic example: entrepreneur outsources software work to a software shop, and pays them. The question I get all the time from such entrepreneurs is: where is all my money going? By requiring that the outsourcing company fill in the business value add section (and this is why it doesn't have to be an engineer doing it.. it could be the PM/BA from the outsourcing company), then the client gets a lot more visibility on where they're money is going, and I think that's fair (it better be, the client can simply make that a requirement when signing the contract). "
1046,What is the difference between scope creep and scope gap?,"As per understanding from given link, scope creep is unapproved additional works, requirements or features of a new product. But I am not clear about: what, then, is scope gap? As per definition, scope gap is specifications or activities added to the project late. Can someone elaborate with a working example in a software project? "
1047,SCRUM and Nexus Frameworks - 1 Team with multiple projects,"I work essentially for 3 companies. A development team consisting of members from the 3 different companies will be formed to build 1 related product (w/ several versions). The complex part is that, because our team consists of members from different companies, some of the time other members of the development team will be doing tasks for different projects. We used Jira to keep track of the issues we need to work on. Would it be better to keep 1 product and sprint backlog for the 1 development team and keep all items for all projects in those backlogs? Would this also mean that there should only be 1 product owner for all projects that would be interacting with various stakeholders, product managers, senior management, etc. of different projects?   The point that I am trying to raise in this setup (1 product backlog and 1 PO) is if a developer is already committed to a sprint of the project, then no one should be able to assign new tasks for this developer except the product owner. Only the product owner should interface with the assigner of the new tasks (coming from stakeholders or clients of different projects) to uphold the sprint commitment, right? "
1048,Are all nodes in Activity-on-Arrow diagrams milestones?,"Should all nodes in AoA represent milestones?  What if I need to show several activities like a1,a2 where there is a single milestone after a2? "
1049,Benefits for the development team from adopting the Behavior Driven Development,"I've been working for this company for about 5 months. They had very aggressive hiring policy and the result was that the development teams were build fairly quick and we started contributing to the product's code base without any formal development process in place. At the beginning most of the people were confused, not knowing what to do, since the product is fairly big, the code base is old and there is a lot of confusing code and few people with enough experience to explain what's going on.  During this period it was obvious that everyone is acting chaotic and back then the need from some formal approach was obvious. However time passed by and now the people have gained some confidence, some experience, knowing a little more about what is expected from them and I would say, they already started to feel comfortable as it is.  And now I'm given the opportunity to try and convince some of those people (the team that I am part of) to try and adopt the BDD. If this had happened two months ago I would feel very confident talking to them. I imagine how I explain them how we will get together at the beginning of each sprint, writing our scenarios, making sure that we all start with the same understanding about what should be done. Then, how there will be no downtime for the QA's but instead the whole team starts working, knowing exactly what needs to be done (eliminating that feel of not knowing what you need to do) and collaborating with each other/helping each other.  Bu this is the picture from 2 months ago. If I tell them now the same things I'm not sure if they gonna be interpreted the same way. I feel that it's most likely that now they will find irritating to spend time writing scenarios (after all now they know what should be done or at least they think so), they don't feel so lost anymore so the idea of pair programming and spending more time discussing stuff is more likely to be seen as waste of time or even sign of lack of skills. Things like living documentation or filling the communication gap won't make much sense either since we haven't hit those problems.. yet, and last but not least I myself lost my confidence that BDD is actually something that will definetlybenefit the team. After all if the team members are feeling OK, if the management is feeling OK, then why bother to change something. Maybe things are going fine.  This is where the things get very subjective and I need some advice. Do you think that given the circumstances the adoption of BDD is something that worth the effort. If no - why? If yes - what arguments would you give to such a team in order to make them enthusiastic about adopting BDD and willing to make the effort needed for that? "
1050,Tracking tasks across all Jira projects,I have many projects that are in progress in JIRA with Scrum teams from User Experience (UX) and Development (dev). Is there a way to see all dev or UX tasks across all projects? I'm currently having to go into each project to view these tasks but I want view everything in one place. Is this possible? 
1051,Does Project Charter change when the Project manager changes?,"What if the project manager changes all of a sudden during the project at any phase (Due to resignation / Personal reasons / Accident).  Does the Project charter also change with it?  If so, Who does the changes, what is the process/way to do it? "
1052,Is QA stage mandatory to be included into user story cycle?,"The problem I came across:   A 2-week Sprint is close to the end (let's say 80% of the time has passed by) A particular user story has just been completed (and has unit tests)   What next? Testing takes time, especially if a special environment should be deployed. So at the end of the Sprint I usually have several user stories under QA, so should I mark them as completed, or not? (Possibly, the question could be rephrased as: 'Should the ""QA COMPLETED"" condition be included into the Definition Of Done?') "
1053,How to treat users stories which were almost completed at the previous sprint?,"How to treat users stories which were almost completed at previous sprint but didn't meet Definition of Done due to testers were late for some reason.  Suppose one of those stories was 5 story points, so how to treat it for the next sprint? Also as 5? Or reestimate it as 1/2? "
1054,How to monitor team members activity and effectiveness?,"I would like to measure the effectiveness and efficiency of my team members.  I'd like the measurement to be relatively objective and transparent, and I believe that some form of software would fulfill those objectives.   How could I search for and evaluate such software?  What kinds of software incorporate these kinds of features (While software recommendations are out of scope because they change frequently, the underlying requirements should be more stable.)   Is there software that might:  - Diagram activity over the past year  - Facilitate peer evaluation?  - Measure improvement?  Are there non-software procedures that would assist? "
1055,Scalability of Scrum,"Is scrum scalable? Can it be employed in large scale non-IT projects?  I have gone through some articles and views on the Internet, which suggest that scrum can be employed in non-IT projects. But I am not sure to what extent. "
1056,Sprints Starting Mid-Week in Scrum,"When people discuss Sprints that start or stop mid-week, they seem to agree that this should be done on a Tuesday or Wednesday. Why is that?  Also, how do week-long Sprints with mid-week starts and stops follow each other without constantly moving which days of the week are used? For instance:   Sprint 1: Tuesday to Tuesday, next sprint starts Wednesday. Sprint 2: Wednesday to Wednesday, next sprint starts Thursday. Sprint 3: Thursday to Thursday, next sprint starts Friday.   Is the idea to do Wednesday to Wednesday, where Wednesdays are the end of the current Sprint and the beginning of the next? "
1057,How can my PERT diagram take account of my resources?,"I want to define the critical path of my project by using a PERT diagram. Let's take a trivial example to show you my problem.  I have 4 tasks defined like this:   Task A with a duration of 1 day without any antecedent ; Task B with a duration of 2 days without any antecedent ; Task C with a duration of 2 days with tasks A and B as antecedents ; Task D with a duration of 2 days with task C as antecedent.   I get this critical path: B -> C -> D. The problem is: what if the tasks A and B need more than all my resources? The task B will fall behind whatever it happens so the task A have to be present in the critical path, right?  How can I handle it? "
1058,What's next after Project Management?,"   Possible Duplicate:   Are Functional Managers or Project Managers Better Candidates for Executive-Level Positions?     I've been working as a software developer for a year now. I'm seriously considering PM as a career ahead. I actually have 2 questions here.  After being a PM for 4-5 years, what's next?   Also, is it possible to reach senior executive/senior management positions after doing Project management for 12-15 years (or is it possible for a PM to become a senior executive at all)?  "
1059,Demo in Sprint Review,"Currently we are following one week Sprint, Post refinement sometimes we encounter few stories which may take more than 1 week time to complete development, integration &amp; Test. This means to produce working software increment it may take more than 1 week.   In planning we are committing logical components development completion and in review we are providing update to PO and Stakeholders on the status of Sprint backlog( how many we achieved and how many we slipped and what happen to make it or slip it).   Is this correct?  Does Scrum mandate working demo in Sprint Review ? Or can we agree a set of PBI and  achieve those by keeping demo as optional (do if end to end development &amp; testings is completed)? "
1060,Should we arrange multiple agile sub-teams along customer groups or along software components?,"The question's context is a company that creates a software product that consists of several functional components (you could also call them sub-products) and sells the product to a rather small number of customers (~10 core customers, &lt;100 in total). Those customers pay a licence fee for new stuff and an annual fee for maintenance. There are around 20 developers, working with an agile process for several years. We consider moving from project teams to fixed teams. We are discussing two primary principles how to arrange the teams: (1) Each team is responsible for a set of functional components, or (2) each team is responsible for a group of customers.  Do you have positive or negative experiences with either option in a similar context? Which of the options is better for the given context? "
1061,Daily Scrum development member taking too much time,A team member is taking too much time at Daily Scrums. What is the best way to resolve this issue as a Scrum Master?  Can I intervene at the Scrum? 
1062,Forced to implement what I think is the wrong solution,"Should I listen to the Team Leader or stick to my position?  Here is some background:  This is a repost of this topic, as I think I've missed the site where I need to ask such questions. And I am not a project manager, I am software developer, but I want to ask project managers of their vision of my problem.  We are team of 3. I'm doing some feature, and while doing that I came to design A. One guy of our team thinks, that this feature should be done with design B. I think his design will produce many bugs in the future. I do not quite understand his position about design A. He just doesn't like it. But let's say he also sees some problems in design A to have the situation more clean. Team leader supports this guy, and is forcing me to do it with design B.  My position here: ""No problem, but I do not want to implement features with the code I'm already see problems in. If you want to do it with design B - you can do it yourself"". He thinks that this is my task, and only I am who should do it. Such situations always repeating, it is not the first time we came to that.  Am I right? Should I obey or stay with my ideology to the end? And should I consider job change in the future? This guy always cut down my designs, and never explains why, and the team leader always supports him. "
1063,Hot swapping people in a scrum team,"In a company, the scrum teams are partly on-shore and partly off-shore. Usually this is 50-50 or 60-40. The teams in their current composition have been mostly going on in a scrum fashion just over a year, with minor leaves/replacements because people join or resign, and that's fine.  However lately, the test manager has hired two additional people at the offshore teams to help with parallel activities (sign-offs, UAT, regression testing activities) without informing the SM, PO or most people in the team. He did inform the ""test team"" though, that is all the testers from the scrum teams.  The scrum master found out by luck, and was called to accommodate these two new people in the teams, given than they won't be 100% allocated to the teams, because of their parallel activities (managed by the test manager).  Additionally, because one of the offshore scrum team members is about to leave for a month, the dev manager decided to replace him with another one offshore, having been reassured that he has been part of another team (for argument's sake DevOps), knows the software, and will do a very good job. This was communicated via an email sent on a day saying ""this guy will replace that guy for one month"".  The scrum master doesn't like this approach for a variety of reasons, some of them being team composition, team building, skillset, team confusion etc. He highlighter this to his manager both times and the counter argument is that the business needs the resource and cannot afford to lose time.  Is the scrum master right? Is it good/bad/neutral thing to hot swap resources (especially in a distributed team). Any similar experiences? "
1064,High level way to explain programming concepts to my boss,"My new boss has a little programming knowledge but not much, he is not technology illiterate but I'm looking for a few suggestions on how to explain programming concepts to him at a high level. Maybe like a pluralsight or treehouse course on building your programming vocabulary. Questions like  What is an API and  why should we use one? What is responsive design? "
1065,Customer seems to be too busy to do regular meetings,"We're doing Agile development, and even though we are not going as strict as Scrum, we'd like to keep the sprint planning meeting so that the customer is able to prioritize on business values for each iteration and possibly some feedback.  That being said, having a product owner as the customer's proxy isn't really an option because the team is not big enough to separate roles like that.  At first glance I thought about talking the customer into assigning someone from his company on his behalf who'd act as his proxy,  with enough power/permissions to make decitions and prioritize business values,  so that we can go with the sprint planning meetings.  The customer's company isn't that big, I'd estimate a maximum of 15 - 20 employees.   Is there a better way to handle this, maybe a different perspective? How should I approach the customer and talk him into a solution? "
1066,How should a Scrum Master deal with an angry stakeholder during a PO meeting?,"As a Scrum Master, recently attended a meeting set up by PO with stakeholders, one stakeholder was concerned that the budget was not being spent properly. It got heated.  At the meeting, I was not sure how to intervene since it was the PO's meeting and since it was the PO's meeting did nothing.   I was thinking at the back of my mind to either:   defend the PO and budget defend the team, since they were kept busy delivering items from the backlog Bring focus to the meeting by telling POs to keep focus on delivering high value items in the following sprints   I am slghtly confused about what to do in this type of situation, what is the best way to handle it? Am I allowed to participate if it is PO's meeting? "
1067,Agile Jira is being bombarded by issues from QA and testers. Need help and suggestions,"I would like to ask regarding our situation. I just joined a startup company and they are starting to do scrum (although I would say it was a poor implementation of scrum with no assigned Scrum Master nor Product Owner). There is a new project being developed  (UI and database) and it relies on a big component (let's name it as Component X - the hardware abstraction layer and low-level hardware access) which was developed a long time ago. Component X was very big, heavily multi-threaded however, it doesnt have any unit tests (I'm quite surprised that nobody knows how to do unit tests in this company) and it does rely only on system unit tests performed by the testers/QA and there are some issues that weren't addressed ever since but the engineers who developed it are still addressing the bugs once it was caught by the testers.   Now, we started Sprint 1 and we are re-using the old Component X, the testers are just putting the crashes into our Agile Jira log and now, the Agile Jira log looks like a bug tracking with more items being put by the testers rather than the Sprint Backlog items.  It's good that Scrum was able to expose this as early as Sprint 1, but how do we address this kind of scenario? Should the testers log the bugs once they are found (our boss, directly told us to log the issues once they were found so that it could be backtracked easily through history search) ? I am thinking of using a dedicated bug tracker e.g. BugZilla so that our tester will never clutter the Backlog items on our Agile Jira. Although if we have a separate bug tracker, there may be instances that the feature is Done on the Agile Jira, while there is an issue logged on the separate bug tracker which could bring confusion to the developers and testers. "
1068,"When using Kanban, how do I write tasks and where to put the ""weight"" of them?","I'm very new to Kanban, which I want to use in my new product.  I am concerned how to organize tasks. For example I may have two tasks: - change the color of the login button - create 3d visualization of data for all users  These two are very different when it comes to costs. How to manage them on an ""in progress"" board. Should I put somewhere the ""weight"" of the task?  Are there any good practices for writing down tasks? "
1069,Meaningful metric to track and forecast research,"Is there a theory and/or study backed way to measure/track and forecast research activities?   As it seems clear that R&amp;D must be treated differently than production work for example, I could not find a reasonable metrics to track and forecast research activity.  I do find work on the necessity of tracking and forecasting research (e.g.Industrial Research Performance Management), but I do not find any description on how to do it.  The reason for my question is that research seems to be to unpredictable and non-linear in order to be measured in the same way as e.g. the production of a car.  So let's set up a case. Say a company has 30,000,000$ of research budget per year and the budget-owner wants to see where attention (and possibly improvement of the research process) is needed. The complete budget is divided in smaller projects. Which tools/metrics/processes are available to aid the budget-owner to see where projects are performing in a way that improvement (return on invest, speed or resource loading) is possible? "
1070,Pair Programming and Display on an IMAX,"I responded to an employment opportunity for an XP developer. I have done several XP projects early in the 2000s, but not lately after Scrum has come into wide practice.  The recruiter said they practice XP, particularly pair programming. And they project the pair programming session on an IMAX screen visible to anyone in the room. I have practiced pair programming, and I love it, for its many benefits - particularly the instant code review and very short feedback loop. Also, a great way to spread knowledge and experience. But our pair programming sessions were private conversations between two people. Sometimes groggy and tired. Sometimes clueless as to how to proceed. Sometimes needing another cup of coffee - you know, human attributes in a real-life working session.  Does anyone out there in XPland practice project a pair programming session on an IMAX screen? Or a large wall display (IMAX is extreme!).  If you do practice that, can you please let us know the rationale and the benefits? "
1071,As a Project Manager how do I evaluate a Six Sigma certification course?,"As a Project Manager seeking professional accreditation in Lean Six Sigma, what factors should I consider when evaluating institutions, trainers and certifications?  On top of a list of things to look for, would an employer recognize a specific institute more than another? "
1072,Can we add more user stories to the Sprint Backlog if the requirements change during a sprint?,"We are currently working on a project where we receive a lot of change requests, and the client insists that we should deliver the changes in the current sprint!  Can I add the new work to the sprint backlog as a new task? Sometimes the tasks' effort changes, like earlier it was an 18 hour job but is now a 32 hour job.  How can I accommodate these changes without making a weird burndown chart? Is it okay to add tasks to a sprint in progress? "
1073,How do I handle user stories and burn down charts?,"I am new to Scrum. I've done some searches; However, I failed to find answers for the following questions:   When should we mark a user story as completed in a burn down? Do we do this when the development is completed or when it's through QA? If a task fails in QA, should we add it as a new user story or update the task hours? If the team asks for extra hours to fix the bugs due to some complexity, how can I update the total time remaining?  "
1074,Why do Agile practice not exist in scientific research projects and organizations?,"This has already been asked (How can a team working on research based items work in an Agile project?), but the thread is from 2011, so I thought I'd poke for an update.  Does anyone know of a good process for managing research projects or a whole research organization (as in scientific research rather than R&amp;D) through Agile methodology? Does anyone know examples of institutes doing this?  I was able to find SCORE (Scrum for Research) but it's mainly for teaching faculty and research students. In a more recent piece Agile Research the authors conclude that ""no “academic agile process” has yet been laid out"". They do take the subject a bit further, developing ""the principles of agile research"" based on their software development counterparts. I've made a preliminary search for scientific papers on agile research, but with no results worth mentioning.  All in all, there seems to be a surprising lack of documents describing the use of Agile in research. Why? It's not a novel idea - has it ultimately proven to be a bad idea? "
1075,Advisable scrum columns for software projects,"Our software team has essentially these storyboard columns:   Backlog To Do Develop Test Done   Unfortunately, people inside and outside the team often attempt to affect the board to represent pre- and post- states of stories.  This has resulted in a board which now looks like this:   Draft Backlog To Do Develop Dev Test To Test Test Tested Done   While I understand that these are completely reasonable and each team has it's own interpretation of the scrum board, I would like to know if and how anyone running into similar problems has been able to get back to 'pure' columns?  Questions to that end could/would be:   What is your definition of 'Develop' or 'Test' when in practice each of those can mean potentially 3 different states (waiting for, doing and completed/needs sign off)? What is the maximum number of columns a reasonable scrum master should allow on their board, on average?  "
1076,How do you get your team to participate in quality assurance practices: Refactoring,"In XP Programming, code refactoring is at the core - it provides outstanding benefits. However, most developers seem to fear refactoring. As the project manager of your team, you not only need to meet deadlines, but also need to provide good quality source code to client. Also, as a leader, you need to think about ways for your team to improve themselves.  I believe Refactoring of code frequently is a good practice that developers should have. The problem is, some developers being too familiar with old way of working, are resistant to refactoring.   How can you ask your team to actually do code refactoring? What did you do? (if you have past experience) "
1077,Reflecting external dependencies,"We use ServiceNow story boards and one element of this tool is that it provides little coloured dots for representing attributes of stories or spikes.  These dots are very limited in number, but our PM has configured some of them to be quite useful, from a visibility use case:   Red: blocked Green: Developer work Blue: DBA work Yellow: Story (as opposed to Spike)   However, some of the dots are, IMHO, being bastardised for unrelated purposes. Some of the other dots are:   Orange: In Sprint - my objection to this is that a story is in sprint if it is in any column from To Do to Done Purple: (Dependent upon) External Team - my objection here is that stories dependent on other teams/or being developed by other teams should have that described within the story and should be prevented from entering the sprint during sprint planning (necessarily involving reading of the story content) Pink: Low Priority - my objection to this is that any low priority story will have it's place on the board and is the responsibility of the PO to set it's position; as it's position rises so too does it's priority; hence, priority is not a static attribute but a growing one   What is the appropriate response to the Orange, Purple and Pink dots? Is there a standard practice regarding even the Red, Green, Blue and Yellow dot approach? (Am I overthinking this?) "
1078,Schedule & Customer Blame,"Here are work we are having some difficulty with, well, difficult customers during the implementation phase of a semi-custom SaaS product. Standard story, I guess, ship deliverable's and then nothing for a week, and then there are ""emergency"" fixes needed overnight.  If the work needs to get done, it'll get done, but how does one formally delay dates when the lag is the customers fault?  Specifically: Is there some standard (contractual) language, which nicely places fixed deadlines on the customer as well? "
1079,"What workflow optimises the use of Lean Startup, particularly when managing Landing Pages?","Background  I'm trying to follow the lean start-up methodology of validating a product. Following the instructions in the book UX for Lean Startups, I first validated the product by conducting interviews with several people from my target market (well actually those interviews made me realize that my idea was based on a non-existent problem, and so I ""pivoted"" and planned a product that solved a problem I found that all my interviewees complained about, a real problem that is).   Then second step was creating a landing page. According to the book:     OK, great. Now you’ve talked to some people, and you think you see a   shared problem that you can solve. It’s still not really conclusive   evidence, right? I mean, what if those were the only five people in   the world who have that problem? Or what if lots of people have the   problem, but nobody’s willing to pay you to help them solve it?       These are valid concerns, and you can address them long before you   write the first line of code. The trick is to sell the product before   you build it. Well, OK, technically that’s kind of fraud, so how about   you just advertise the product before you build it?      By building a few one-page sites, you can get a ballpark figure of the   number of people who are interested in paying you to solve their   problem. And the great thing is, you can start doing this before you   start building anything. This means if nobody shows any interest in   using your product, you can keep looking for new product approaches   very cheaply until you find something that people are interested in   using.      To be clear, I’m not just talking about direct-to-consumer Internet   products here. Although you’re using the Internet to advertise your   ideas, you don’t have to be building the next Amazon.      Have a concept for a premium day spa for pets? Why not build a website   for it first and see how many people try to make reservations for   Poodle Pedicures? It’s a hell of a lot cheaper to build a landing page   than it is to get salon chairs designed to fit a variety of dogs.      With landing-page tests, you can start to validate both your market   and your product. By advertising a real thing (or several real things)   that you are going to be selling, you’re getting the best kind of   feedback that people are willing to pay you for what you’re making.   You can also get a sense of which version of your product has the   biggest potential market, which can be a huge advantage in deciding   what to build first.      Klein, Laura (2013-05-02). UX for Lean Startups: Faster, Smarter User   Experience Research and Design (p. 12). O'Reilly Media. Kindle   Edition.   Problem  I created the landing page,     made a Facebook and Google Ad Words ad campaign, and put a text field that prompted the users to give me their emails. The conversion rate was terrible, like let's say 0.03% of my visitors gave me their emails. Which, according to the book, is fine, b/c this is what the lean people call ""failing cheaply"" and it would be a good indication that I should probably pivot my product vision yet again.   However, once I had a 1:1 usability test on my landing page website (where my question was simply: what does this page tell you?), the subject said: I have no idea what your product is all about. Which made me realize that perhaps my lousy conversion rates wasn't about a product problem, but more of a web design/SEO problem. So following unbounce's landing page checklist I went ahead and hired an animator from fiverr.com to create an intro video.  Question  I can keep on improving my website to increase my conversion rate using SEO and stuff from unbounce's check list. I can for example replace my ""economy"" animator with a heavy duty one and pay x10 the price ""to get a better quality video"".. I can put a lot of time into improving the design of my site etc etc. But at what point can I realize that my low conversion rate problem is a product problem, not a poor web design problem?     Discussion  This is in response to the points brought up in this answer:     Are you using the Lean Validation Board, the Business Canvas or some other quick prototyping board to crystallize your thinking?   No, but I'll look into it     What acquisition channels are you using?   facebook  I have started with facebook ads, and used this add:    But the response rate was terrible.. My conversion rate (ie the percentage of people reached to those that actually added their email was like 0.05%    someone advised me that google adwords was better than fb ads, so I immediately paused the FB ad campaign (I'm also running on a limited budget, that's another thing), and created an Adword campaign.. using this:    but the results weren't that much better:    so I decided to freeze both ad campaigns and start working on the landing page itself by working on an intro video.. which should be released soon.  As of now, this is my stats from google analytics:    The bounce rate calculation is not accurate I don't think, b/c This is the total people who have given me their email (I connected the form straight to a google docs sheet):      so I'd say the overall bounce rate is much higher than what's reported by google analytics.     Are those channels optimised for conversion or are they landing on your page cold?   I don't understand the question. How is a channel ""optimized"" for conversion?     How are you collecting positive feedback / measuring success / activating customers?   Email sign-ups?   Yes, a customer is ""activated"" on my system simply by giving me their email on the form. I also subsequently send them to fill another form.. but that's an auxiliary thing.. I'm not relying on that.     Click through tracking on a Call To Action (CTA) button?   Yeah that's done.. I've specified that as my conversion trigger on both Facebook and Google Analytics.      What is your bounce rate from the landing page?   What is your time on site per customer?   answered above     What user behaviour occurs on the landing page?   Well I'm glad you asked this, I neglected to see the video recordings on my hotjar account.. But apparently they are all telling me the same thing! people are clicking on the field but nothing is happening.. I reckon this is a hotjar bug because this seems to only happen in recorded sessions.. you can verify yourself by trying to fill in your email on the form.  see these vids for example:   [website][website]here is a vid of someone checking out the stuff, but simply not doing anything:  - [website]here is a vid of someone simply glaring at the screen and doing nothing for several minutes.. not sure what to make of it - [website]"
1080,"We work with fixed scope, price and time - why should we use Story points?","We deliver projects in fixed price, fixed time and fixed scope environment. We have a contract that specify those, specifications of features. Recently, an agile couch was trying to convince me to switch to story points but I fail to see how this would help me?  Why should I add an abstract unit that does not bring anything? Velocity is nice, but I have features estimated with time so I can clearly see whether we are making the deadline or not. By the nature of the contract, I cannot not have time estimates as high level estimates were done to calculate the price! So, I know I have 13 people, 5 months and have to deliver X features. How would story points help me in this situation? I am really trying to see the benefit here. "

1082,New to Project Management with a new team on a short deadline,"I have just been put in charge of a brand new team of a developer and designer, the first of each for our company. I've never had this role before, but I do have some design, development, and management experience.  This company has a been selling its product for over a year now. The development was outsourced and as such, the development process is a new concept to this company. In addition, the design that did exist in the company prior was only graphically focused as opposed to user focused. There is a long list of outstanding bugs and technical debt on the backlog and there is no real design or researched foundation for the product that exists today.  I have a limited amount of time to turn this product into something usable by the clients we have been trying to sell to. What should be the first thing I tackle? How do I handle this role while still trying to figure out this role. How do I facilitate a brand new team in working together?  "
1083,setting ITIL as a common framework for multiple IT teams around the world,"My manager and I have been tasked to manage/incentize multiple IT teams in different geographical regions (with multiple time zones and different cultural understanding).  The teams are not experienced ones yet, lacking basic discipline on how to test, review and roll out.     I was thinking of setting up a methodology like ITIL or Information Technology Infrastructure Library to lay the foundation for a mutual understanding, e.g you don't roll out without a test or without basic communication to the users.   Would ITIL be a decent framework for that?  If ITIL was not the 'thing', is there another methodology for that? Has anyone got any experiences with this and would be willing to share it, please?    Thanks "
1084,How can I find project charter resources?,"I am new as a project manager. I was told that I have to write a project charter for a new project that I will have to manage. Are there any templates explaining what has to be in that charter?    I understand it as some kind of contract, but a contract between who? How can I precisely define the scope of the projects? The deadlines? "
1085,MS Project Change Working Time - Roster,How can I change the working time to 2 weeks ( working - 14 days) and 1 week (not working - 7 days)? Is this able to be automatically populated? 
1086,How can user stories meet INVEST criteria in design-led development?,"How should our team handle agile development when the development is pretty much steered by the final product designs, which were done in advance? In other words, how can we break down requirements into small INVEST user stories when the only artifacts you have are the FINAL (gold plated) designs?  For example - the designer designs a telephone with many buttons/features (call waiting, call block, etc). The business (for obvious reasons) wants to delivery value, quickly. So, my understanding suggests we might:   first build a phone with no buttons that can RECEIVE calls,  then build in some buttons purely for dialling,  then build in a ""hang up"" button  then build a loudspeaker   etc...  However, we have no designs for the phone with X buttons at Stage 2. It seems like potentially more work/headache for a developer to build something that we know will need to be done (from a front-end point of view).  Solutions:   produce wireframes to support the incremental building of features (rather than JUST the end product designs) let the dev run with it - barebones, no design   Hope I've explained this sufficiently. "
1087,Are daily stand ups the same for Kanban and Scrum teams?,"There is a lot of discussion about what should and what should not be allowed in daily stand ups. Some people say it should not include status updates.   What is the definition of a status update?  Scrum seems to say that you should do a status update e.g.:    What you did yesterday,  What you will do today and  Any Impediments   Is Kanban the same or different? "
1088,How to handle when planned work is blocked and a developer has capacity to take on a new user story that may be too big,"Assume the following situation.  All but one user story planned in a sprint is completed.  The remaining user story is blocked.    A developer would like to take on work in the highest priority work in the backlog that has been estimated.  Unfortunately, the story is bigger than the time remaining.  Ideally, the developer would like to make an early start on work that will be planned for the next sprint.  What is the proper way to handle this situation?  Should the user assign the unplanned work to the next sprint?  In this case, the active sprint does not include all the work that is actively being worked on (ideally, we want the active sprint to be the source of truth of what developers are working on)  If we assign it to the active sprint, then we will most likely have a spill-over.  Everyone would prefer not to do this unless there is a straight forward way to distinguish spill over from planned work vs spill over from unplanned work.  What is the standard way for handling this situation? "
1089,Recommendations for project core metrics,"I am currently trying to create some better systems for keeping on top of the projects which I need to manage. As part of this, I am attempting to draw up a list of core metrics that I think every project will have (so I can write a program to display data about each project).   I understand that every project will be different, and each will have their own metrics, but surely each project will have some metrics which are always going to be the same as others. I'm trying to think more about high level stuff as oppose to individual tasks. For example:   Outcomes - what is the outcome of this project. What will it look like when it is finished. Goals/milestones - what are the goals or milestones of this project. This could potentially be the same as outcomes, but maybe more abstract. E.g. by the 1st of march, it should be in x state. On track - is this project on track for completion Budget - what is the budget for this project   Maybe I'm trying to invent something of my own which isn't helpful, and I'd appreciate being told this if so.  There are some similar questions on this site, but I'm not sure they really cover the metrics I have just outlined.   Project metric definitions What metrics to keep through out the life of the project?   As another question, if this same question was asked on a 'departmental' (e.g. finance/HR) or 'organisational' (the whole company) level, what metrics would be good for tracking progress and keeping order? "
1090,Effective Manager drills,"I am a tech lead, who had recently transitioned to becoming a people manager. It was something I wanted to try out, though I wasnt quite sure what it meant.   After 6 months at it, I am still not quite sure what it means. Oddly enough, despite the efforts from my bosses are having a hard time precisely quantifying what this job entails. I had two questions:   1) Can you suggest a good book for a novice like me to read and learn from?  2) When I think of a skill (my background is in mathematics), I think of  mastering the minutia of it through ""drills"" (exercises/assignments/what not) in an offline setting before getting to the real online task (solving some real world problem). Simply put, my view is that the better I am at the drills, the better I get at real world problems. What are the equivalent offline ""drills"" in management, and could you suggest where/how I could practice it in an offline setting? Textbooks/best practices/ anything would help  "
1091,Concepts of PM tools,"I am currently looking for a not-so-complicated PM tool. I haven't done PM very deep so far, and my overall idea about PM and the representation in PM tools is about this:  There are some employees who have time to work. There are projects which have to be realized. Projects consist of tasks, which are handled by employees, by spending their work on the tasks. Tasks can be split into sub tasks, can be prioritized and dependencies can be set between tasks. Nothing uncommon.  What i expect from a PM tool is that i enter all these information into the tool, and the tool organizes the tasks in a way that the employees are assigned to tasks, and that the tasks are ordered according to their priorities, dependencies and availability of employees. (Ok, assigning employees to tasks is of course done by me.) So that a task starts no earlier than when employees for this task are available and dependencies are met. And when the last task is finished, the project is finished, so the tool tells me how long the project takes.  I have been looking around for those tools for quite a while now (several hours searching on the web), but either no tool offers this functionality or it is not visible from the tool description.  I wonder, do i maybe have the wrong picture of a PM tool, and i should get a different view on PM in common, or do the tools exist and i have simply missed these features?  For example, GanttProject is basically what i'm thinking of, but the tasks still have to be moved by hand, if an employee is working on two overlapping tasks. And it has a bug (since 2008) that when an employee is on vacation, he is still working on the tasks. This simply makes the tool unusable.  So the basic question is: Does automatic task organization not work well in practice and does not exist therefore, or do i have missed it?  The background: We are a small software development team with just a few people, so a complex PM suite for large companies (i'm thinking of Jira) would be somehow too much.. "
1092,How to find out the appropriate High Level Requirements?,"Is there any official definition of high level requirements? I've searched google for a while but its still confusing me a lot.  I have a list of (Candidate) High Level Requirements. And, I want to classify them as appropriate and inappropriate High Level Requirements. How can I do that? What criteria should I be checking against? "
1093,Conflict in team over Scrum vs Gantt,"I'm a developer in a very small startup consisting of 6 people, and I have decided to cure our lack of organization now that we have clients.  To give a little context, here is our organization:   2 junior developers (myself included) 1 senior business specialist 1 junior seller 1 senior seller who's the boss   For the last whole year, we had absolutely no organization. Everything was complete anarchy, and we were all over-working. We often miss deadlines set a long time in advance, lack visibility over our workloads and the business specialist is nearly in nervous breakdown. :D The only thing keeping stuff in check was my huge gantt chart I had to update a lot.  So we decided to get back on what we did before:    A scrum board. (our business specialist was fed up with the ""hippie"" side of Scrum and lobbied to stop all kind of meetings, discussions etc to spend more time working). But as always it's working great for the dev but the others need very clear workload view to understand how many things they have to do for the next month or so.   The problem is that I know that it can't work, as I was the one managing the Gantt chart for the last year. Fixing set tasks doesn't work when you build software, as we underestimate time too much because of pressure. Also, the gantt chart is only good at the end of the project, after 300 successive updates.  So should I try to convince everyone to go for the more frightening Scrum way of ""planning"" stuff, without set dates for sub-tasks completion nor visuals for the next month workload per member, etc? Or should I just accept to build yet another fake Gantt chart to reassure everyone, making them believe we can plan one year in advance the life of a software development project? Or is there another way? "
1094,Using Scrum for clients' migration on already live product,"Is it worth working in 2-week sprints, and in a Scrum fashion for that matter, for a client migration project from a legacy system, to a system which is already live and with other clients (a white label software)?  It seems to me to be somewhat futile to try to fit tasks into 2-week sprints, since whether they’re delivered or not, no one is going to complain (since the client is already live on a legacy software). The only effect will be to move the migration date (that has been set by a project manager) to an earlier or later date, which is reviewed every 2 weeks.  I think a Kanban style is more appropriate, as the workload is known (no surprises or areas to explore) and it’s going to take however long it’s going to take to deliver the software. There’s no added functionality as it would be with incremental releases in Scrum, because the client is still on the legacy system. Can anyone provide any reasons for or against using Scrum for clients' migration from legacy products to new live products? "
1095,What is your focus: increasing metrics or improving processes?,"I noticed (in our company) that Scrum Masters have one of the approaches:   Start with metrics and work on improving the numbers: e.g. a new user story comes up during sprint, the team might reject it because it affects velocity. So the decision making process is centered around the metrics and how that action will influence the metrics and the team performance.  Start with value and focus on increasing value: e.g. a new user story comes up into sprint, how important is that user story for the product (or valuable) => decision is entirely made based on this. Affected metrics are irrelevant, as long as you know why the delta happens. Start with process and focus on process improvement: e.g. a new user story comes up, putting it up during the sprint will disrupt the sprint and probably lower performance overall, so the team decides to leave it out (even if the story would increase the product value) and do it in the next sprint.    My teams and I combine 2 &amp; 3 (if value is high, we add it to the sprint). But I saw a focus on 1 a lot for example.  So my question is: what do you focus on? How do you make decisions, and what do you thinks are the drawbacks of choosing only one or another?   "
1096,Kanban or Scrum for tough deadline project?,"Sorry in advance if my question looks silly, but it's bothered me for quite a long time and haven't found the answer to it yet. I work in an IT outsource company and due to specifics of my job I participate in interviews quite often on either side (as a candidate or interviewer). And I can say that there is one popular question for a team leading roles that I never really knew how to answer correctly:     Which process methodology (Scrum or Kanban) would you prefer for a   project of tough deadline?   This question doesn't make a lot of sense to me. I actually don't think that any approach is better in this context, since both have approximately the same amount of process overhead compared to no-process approach. I think the goal of either of them is to make things predictable and transparent, but not faster, and I don't think that time aspect is any measurable here.   People tend to answer Kanban to this question since it's more flexible and has lower restriction for WIP, but i think that Kanban won't win the race if you work on a well-documented huge project and can just scale sprint length to fit your team speed perfectly, so it rather depends on project preconditions.   Am I correct here? "
1097,Individual performance or team performance?,"In line with Scrum, a true self-managed team should be viewed and assessed only as a team. E.g. if the team is high performant, when we discuss about increasing salaries, each person in the team should get the same % increase.  But this is the ideal situation. In reality not everyone in the team contributes in the same way / same quality / same effort to the result.   Question:   Do you measure individual performance at all?  How would it work - if the case in your organisation - deciding salaries and rewards based on team performance?  Anybody actually functions in the ideal situation above? Where salaries are equivalent and increases are team-based?    How we do currently: we review each dev in a review circle (made of Seniors) and salary and compensation is made based on the review. The team metrics doesn't affect in anyway this (and it seems to be quite unfair).  "
1098,How does a project manager manage and motivate people that don't actually report to the PM?,"Scenario:  Software development team does NOT report to PM, but PM is responsible for hitting milestone dates and not exceeding budget.  Sometimes, developers have to do work for other PMs, so less than 100% of their time is available.  Questions:   As the PM, how can I motivate the developers to produce the results I need (quality work, done on time and within budget)? If there are no negative consequences for developers being late or doing shoddy work, how can I get the best possible work out of them?   Other than being one voice out of many at semi-annual performance reviews, I have no way to influence (positively or negatively) the quality or timeliness of the developers' work product.  Yet my performance is evaluated based on making the deadlines and managing the budget.  How does a project manager manage and motivate people that don't actually report to the PM? "
1099,How to prepare a schedule from Waterfall to Agile in software developement,"As a program advisory I need to schedule 5 projects in the next year but one of them will be agile (the first in our business).  All of the projects that are waterfall are easy to schedule:  Authorisation/architecture/development/tests/delivery  How do I schedule a 2 years project from a high level management perspective, using the Agile methodology?  What are the main phases of agile development?  Thank you "
1100,Is there a way to setup a manual testing hierarchy in Jira that can be used iteratively?,"Is there a way to setup a manual testing hierarch in Jira that can be used iteratively? For example, the following would be a hierarchy checklist:  Testing Windows, iOS Windows Desktop, Windows Web, iOS Desktop, iOS Safari   And then once checklist is complete, be able to clone the entire hierarch and start again on a new iteration? "
1101,Is refactoring part of a task in a sprint or a separate task for after the sprint?,"I want my team to do refactoring as often as it is possible, and follow some guides from Martin Fowler book. Although I'm confused about something:  If we use scrum or kanban and decide to work on one task only, then in the commit message (git) mention to the task, when do we work on refactoring? how we name our commits?  edit:  as my question may be unclear (I'm sorry I'm not english native). We have tasks in team, and we are commiting to git with a task number. The first thing is: when to do refactoring? after sprint ends or in the middle? the second: how to name commits as we have convention to add task number in comment. "
1102,What are developers expected to do during testing in the latter half of each Sprint?,"When you are using the Scrum framework, a Sprint cycle involves development and QA. At the end of the Sprint the tasks worked upon and tested are showcased and released.  Typically, for a team of 3 to 4 developers there would be 1 QA resource. What are the developers expected to do when QA is happening? Since the number of developers is much higher than the number of QA testers, bug fixes get done very quick and developers are left with nothing to do towards the end of the Sprint.  What is expected of the developers during this QA testing while following Scrum? "
1103,Effort Estimation in Production Support Projects,"How can we do the effort estimation for Production support projects? Need to decide count of resources in L1,L2 and L3?  I have 2 projects -  1)Apps with few months of Ticket details  2)Apps with No Ticket Details   Approach I am planning to take :   1)Case 1:I have ticket details and i have taken weightages related to technical ,application complexity etc. and productivity factor i.e. no of tickets per month that can be solved by L1,L2,L2,%distribution of L1,L2,L3, Average Tickets for L1,L2andL3 and based on that decided on the L1,L2,L3 count   2)Case 2:I have taken the application size i.e. LOC, converted it to Function Point and based on productivity factor decided number of resources, then decided on the some % distribution to L1,L2 and L3.

1104,Estimation of non-estimability project,"We need to create some solution with a new technology, in which no member of my team has any experience.  The higher management demends the tentative dates of the working solution.  After a week of investigation, my team still can't give even a rough estimation of time.  We made the list of possible problems, but all of them demands their own investigation. Furthermore, according my experience, I am sure, that we have only half of the future problems (in a best case) in this list. During implementation we will meet a lot of issues, that we can't predict today because of our current poor knowledge of the used technology.  Of course, I understand that the final date like “when it's done” is unacceptable for the higher management.  So, how should we estimate such non-estimability projects?  I understand that this question sounds a little bit stupid, but I'm sure, that all of us have this kind of problem (especially in the Software Development area).  Maybe we should:   Try to guess the time (make a guesstimation) and multiply it by two (just in case). Than pray that we can finish in this period. Ask for more time for the investigation. But, of course, the higher management will not like this. And the whole time of  the investigation will be unknown also. Don't take this project at all, defer because we do not have enough knowledge in the demanded technology (not the best choice for image of our department). Other variants?  "
1105,Resource-Task table in MS Project,Does anybody knows how to export workload of single resources (columns) per task (rows) from MS Project?

I would be very grateful. 
1106,How to handle project that (I think) not using any framework or has unclear workflow?,"Let me describe what's in the project, The people involved in this project is:   Company owner Project owner Consultant  4 software engineers     I'm one of the software engineers there. The responsibility/what they do are:   Company owner   Most of the requirement is defined by them and transferred to the Owner of the project (I assume this is done orally, there's really no documentation about this)   Project owner   Brief the software engineers about the requirement from the company owner by telling it in the meeting.  Verify the progress by watching the application runs demonstrated by the engineers and sometimes by handing the app to the future user of the app. Listen to the Company owner/user feedback and translate it to a new requirement that soon briefed to the engineer. Discuss with the consultant/engineer what is the best practice when dealing with a problem/requirement.   The project owner has other many responsibilities, so the availability is somewhat limited.  Consultant   Get asked opinion from the project owner about what is the best practice from a problem/requirement. Tell/influence the project owner if some requirement is just too difficult to manage later.    The consultant just appear once in a while, so doesn't always available to engineer onsite (maybe available to the project/company owner)  Software Engineers   Develop the project Writing/take notes about the briefed requirement Demonstrate/report the project progress.   Note: this is from my point of view. there's no handbook about this    Project Management Tools   Notepad/ Text Editor Trello Slack   The problem  The project owner admits that the requirement isn't all clear, it needs to be discussed with the company owner and all the potential user. So often the requirement changes.   The requirement isn't documented by a framework so it is just a text from a full meeting. The meeting text isn't always verified by the project owner. The text is just a brief description of a new feature and the constraint, not really detailed like a flow diagram, sequence, etc.     I think the project owner just assume what he thought about was already   stated in the meeting and the engineers wrote all the correct   description about it and will implement as is.   After a meeting passed, the text will be posted to slack and break down by the engineer to the trello board. The project owner and the consultant can read the slack and the trello board. But there wasn't any complain/correction made to those document. I have a feeling, there may be an occasion where it's not correctly written. But seems it just got away every time.   The structure of the trello card isn't defined either. Sometimes it titled by the module engineers worked with and contains checklists of the break-downed task from the meeting (not really detailed) [1]. Sometimes it is just a single task with a little bit detailed description [2]. Maybe that's why there's no complain/correction, but I already talked about it. The project owner &amp; consultant seems just agree and let the engineer take care of it.      And in my opinion, the review process from the project owner seems   doesn't complete. It just jumped from one to another feature. When it   seems partially complete the project owner already jumped to review   another feature. And sometimes just adding more requirement to be   done. When I asked my teammate, they feel that although we finished   developing a feature, it doesn't feel complete.     I want to propose better project management for this situation, but I haven't really had the experience to say. What kind of project management can be put into work there? I read somewhere that agile is good for prone to change requirement. Should I say agile?   But really, I haven't had any experience about it. I'm afraid, by just doing what I partially understand results in more hassle than good. I want all of the party satisfied by working on this project.   I already talked about this problem with the project owner and all the engineers. We agreed that we'll discuss this in the upcoming meeting.  "
1107,"What projects should get scored, and which should not?","We are in the process of implementing a project portfolio management method where none has existed previously.  We have done a good deal of research and developed a process that includes a scoring model.  Analyzing project proposals, working with clients, and scoring them will take a significant amount of time for each project.  For short term projects, the time and effort put into evaluating and scoring the project will be more than the time and effort required to execute the project.  My questions are:    In your experience, how have you decided what projects should not be scored?    Which projects is it not worth scoring because they are so short term (dare I say easy)?    What do you do with those projects?  How do you compare them to projects that are being scored when determine which project should be done next? Do you even consider these quick wins to be projects, or just tasks on a to-do list?  "
1108,What are the steps to be taken in the initial projects in Software Companies?,"I'm working in the middle level of a software company. My role is a software developer. I don't know what processes are to be handled in the Software Development company?  Can you explain me in detail? So many hierarchies are used in the Software Developement companies (i.e CMM Level Companies). Now I have 5 years of experience in software development, but I don't know what are the steps to be intially taken in the Software Development Companies. What are the designs handled in the Software Development companies? "
1109,Create MS Project report which to return incomplete tasks per user with due date,"I want to be able to produce a report I can share with resources on a project so that they have visibility on what outstanding tasks they have (overdue, current, future) and when they are due.  Ideally this would be grouped by task as multiple resources will assigned to a task, e.g.   Task 1 | Resource 1, Resource 2 | 25/01/2019 Task 2 | Resource 1, Resource 3 | 27/01/2019 Task 3 | Resource 2, Resource 3 | 29/01/2019  I have been looking at the reports functionality and attempted to create a custom report but so far have not been able to create anything that satisfies my requirements.   Is it possible to create a report which satisfies my requirements? If so how?  Thanks "
1110,How to work with a team member with a severe tic?,"I am a researcher at a university. I have supervised some Master's theses, but never a work project.   Today, I informed my first ever student assistant that she is hired. She is a nice girl and has more work experience than the average student. But she also has a strange form of stutter. She can talk smoothly for some sentences, but at some point, she starts searching for a word. At this point, she lays her had to a side, and her eyes roll up, showing only the whites, while she is trying to say the word. This can continue for up to a minute. The fact that we are communicating in her third language probably doesn't help either.   Co-workers who have taught her warned me what to expect, so I wasn't shocked the first time it happened during her job interview. I also asked less questions than I would have if she hadn't had the problem. I just patiently sat there while she searched for the word, and there was only one time she gave it up, else she was able to recover and say the word at some point. They also told me that she usually just tries to speak as little as possible, but they don't really know more than that.   Later, she will be able to do most of her work by herself. But at the beginning, we will probably have to discuss a lot. And I am afraid that especially at the beginning, when she isn't yet at ease around me, she will have the most problems talking.   My experience from the interview was this: When we are talking and the tic happens, I am feeling silly and inadequate. I try to sit there with an encouraging smile and wait, but have no idea how she is interpreting my behaviour. I can think of several things I could do in the future, and have no idea whether she would be glad for it, or consider it rude. What I have thought of until now is:    If I have a good guess of what she is trying to say, I can prompt her with the word. But I don't know if she would like that, and my guesses aren't that good (unlike some stutterers, she doesn't pronounce the first part of a word before getting the tic).  I could offer her to converse by instant messaging, even though she is sitting in the same room. It would be a very thorough solution if it works, but also one which feels even more awkward than the rest.  I could offer her to talk in English, because it is her second language. Maybe she grasps less for words in it, so this could lower the frequency of the tics.  The approach I would like best is that I just directly ask her how she would like me to behave, and whether there is something we could do to make the situation better. I mean, she is aware that I am aware of her tic, so why not speak openly about it? But I am afraid that she would consider such open speaking rude, and I don't want to be considered rude by somebody I will be working with a lot.    It doesn't help that most people consider me very blunt. My friends have grown used to my sometimes tactless questions, and know that I often don't realise that they will have a problem answering them until after I have asked them and noticed their reaction. But discussing such a sensitive topic with a person who is still practically a stranger, and presumably quite shy, will really be very hard for me.   So I wonder, how should I react. Should I ask her for her preferences? Or suggest ideas of my own? Or say nothing and treat her with patience, hoping that we'll get the communication done somehow? And if I decide that I should talk to her about it, when should I bring it up? Is it better to give her some time to get more comfortable about working and communicating with me, or will waiting look bad, as if I have been hoping that the problem will be minor, but have noticed that it hampers our work? And if I should wait, than for how long should I wait?  "
1111,Daily standup vs. Micro-management,"Why isn't the daily scrum considered to be micromanagement?  Under any other circumstances expecting to get a daily update from developers would be considered micromanagement. Maybe even pico-management. (did I just invent a term?)  Even a weekly update was considered borderline micromanagement by many.  What changed that the daily scrum is acceptable, both to the engineers and the Project Managers?  (Future question: can this change (if it exists) be used for more frequent updates in a non-scrum setup?) "
1112,How to add dynamic date footer to project print-out?,I see other people printing our project's Gantt chart with an up-to-the-date date on the bottom.  How do they to do that? Is it automatic or must one do something every time one prints the chart? 
1113,Who is the sponsor?,"I am looking for a good book on project organisation:  I was told that the project consists of (a) a project team, with a project manager, an IT coordinator and a business coordinator and (b) A project steering committee with a project sponsor, the project manager and a project owner.  These are all roles, but how do we know who is the project sponsor ? Who is the project owner, are they the same ?  Are there books on these topics ? Guidelines ? Best practises ?  EDIT:  @CodeGnome: if the answers can be given without referring to a book then it would be great: who is the project sponsor? The finance department? Who is the project owner?   @CodeGnome: I am head of a department that wants to build a database. The database will be fed by data collected from monthly surveys organised by my department. The answers will be loaded in that database.  The database will be used by at least four other departments. I assume the me, head of the department that will keep the database, I am owner. But who is the sponsor? "
1114,Carrying items over from one sprint to the next,"Question: Carrying items over from one sprint to the next  Answer: Yes  Scenario: I am a new scrum master on a team and we have just completed our first sprint. I was not here when the team planned the sprint but We planned to complete 73 Story Points. I calculated our velocity is about 53 story Points (Previous Sprints) and some team members was off during December and one person had a child. I am not sure why they planned full capacity with those people on leave.  Task 1 : 8sp - Done Task 2 : 20sp - WIP Task 3 : 8sp - Done Task 4 : 5sp - Testing in Progress Task 5 : 8sp - WIP Task 6 : 8sp - WIP Task 7 : 8sp - Testing Failed Task 8 : 8sp - WIP   The sprint ends tomorrow and there is a bunch of stories going to the new sprint. As mentioned I calculated the team velocity as 53sp (Previous Sprints), With the work in WIP/Testing Failed it adds up to 21 (If testing passes on 5sp item). They do buddy programming if someone is stuck, which is awesome.   Do I carry those over to new sprint and if it gets completed mid sprint we just add stories to the sprint from backlog? - I say yes that is correct. My velocity will be influenced by data such as above, can I work out velocity by: Remove highest (This will be next sprint if we carry items over) velocity and lowest velocity, count the rest and divide by number of sprints? In the current sprints retrospective I will mention the following:  a. Cross skill - Need to work on that  b. We need to plan better and keep leave in mind  c. We need to speak up during the sprint if we wont make the sprint, then we     can make necessary adjustments  d. Remind them of scrum values.  e. Cant we make tasks smaller?   Do you perhaps have any other suggestions to improve our planning, committed items to reach our target velocity and am I on the right track? "
1115,What is the procedure for adjusting the project schedule when a team member is replaced?,"There is a project team with a project manager and 5 development resources working on a Web 2.0 web application. The current project the team is working on is for a long term client who commissioned a desktop and mobile website that they will use to build brand recognition for a new product line they will be selling on a mobile and web ecommerce platform, which the team will build using open source tools.  Background:   Only two of the development resources have experience with building ecommerce solutions.  The other three development resources have never worked on an ecommerce platform.  The project manager has noted this as a risk, since there is a financial component to ecommerce platforms that can have serious security implications. The project manager has completed the schedule and has loosely allocated most of the tasks to the 5 team members, with the highest risk items being assigned to the two ecommerce experts.  The software development methodology is closer to the waterfall model than an agile methodology due to the specific client and their need to avoid uncertainty.   The client has signed off on the project authorizing it to begin.  Problem: Hijacked Resources:  At the last minute, another project manager of another team convinced senior management to move one of the expert resources from this team and replace her with an intern. This project manager has a strong relationship with senior management, goes to lunch with them, and even sometimes hangs out with them outside of work. This PM has an unofficial reputation for stealing project resources and throwing his weight around using his influence.  With the client having already signed off on the project and an agressive, 9 month estimate, the project team is concerned they won't be able to meet the deadline because of the huge learning curve for the 4 inexperienced team members.  After speaking with senior management, the request to move the expert back to the team was declined.   How should the project manager reallocate the tasks that were assigned to the ecommerce expert who was replaced with an intern? Is there a specific strategy or methodology that should be followed to determine how the tasks should be assigned?  "
1116,How to Politely Refuse Changing Decisions,"I just launched a game with a small virtual team of three (plus myself). It was quite successful. We made some decisions like using email as our primary communication medium, and iRC as our primary chat mechanism.  Now, three other new people have joined the team. (We're an informal collection, unpaid, collaborating on a common interest.) Some of those decisions, and others, are being challenged.  I know that the right move is to remain with the decision, because I personally spent countless hours researching and reaching the same conclusion from different angles about these decisions. I cannot indulge in churn from re-opening old decisions every time someone new shows up.   So for now, the decisions are irreversible, barring unforseen circumstances.  How do I communicate this? I need ultimately to get buy-in from the team on any given decision, don't I? But it's a team of individuals with strong opinions -- some may buy in and go forward accepting it, and others may do so because it's required of them on the team, while still others may continue to challenge it at every opportunity. "
1117,Choosing a tool for Scrum,"I'm considering the use of a software in order to help our team to implement Scrum. I saw iceScrum, but I don't know if it's a good tool. Do you ever used it? Can you suggest another tool? "
1118,Advice on Agile team structure,"I’m looking for a little advice…. let me start at the beginning….  My Organisation is very traditional and our organisation structure a little strange. Our web team are part of the marketing department (which includes content, social media, support &amp; development) and are responsible for all public facing websites.  IT are their own department are responsible for back end systems.  In the past few years the lines between these two sections have become blurred with a web based backend CRM system that plugs into the public facing website.  Last summer we changed the development team model to an Agile methodology and we’ve seen big gains in performance and efficiency.  I am part of the Development team but had been working (sub consciously as a Product Owner)  with IT implementing their new web based system so I am now the Product Owner for the web team.  We have a scrum master &amp; 3 developers and we all report to the Web Team Manager.  Now onto the problems… I am acting as Product owner for all software products (regardless of which department is responsible for them) which means I have to operate on an organisational perspective rather than any single product. While the Dev team report to the Web Team Manager, ultimately they work on all web based systems we have.  Our manager has placed herself into the Dev team as a pseudo-tester which they feel enables them to attend stand-ups &amp; retro’s and the dev team feel they cannot be open in their retro as a result.  They also act as the point of contact with the organisation on all changes to our websites thus making them the customer also.  Our backlog refinements are now the same people, the Scrum Master, Web Team Manager and myself s Product Owner.  In our sprint demo’s we demo to the manager as they are technically the customer.  On a more operational basis, Dev team members request their holidays through the Web Team Manager, but they always check with me first, then make their request and then the Web Team Manager contacts me to see if request is ok.  So my questions are:   As a Product Owner, should some of these Line level tasks be routed to me instead or is it best to focus on the product?  As a Product Owner, should I be the person dealing with all customers within the Organisation on new pieces of work?  Is it appropriate for the Web Team Manager to assume the many hats that they have?  Given our somewhat unusual Organisational structure, what feedback would you give on how our structure is setup and what changes would you recommend to bring clarity on responsibility for developing and maintaining our software?  "
1119,Tools in agile methods,"We are currently in the process of implementing Scrum. I would like to let us started with a tool to help the team get along with it (see here about this point), but after a presentation I made where I spoke about the agile manifesto, our CEO is arguing that it's against the agile principles (""Individuals and interactions over processes and tools""). Problem is: we are not going any further without some formalisation of the organisation, and a tool to organise our backlog and our sprints would be the right thing to do now, in my opinion. Did you meet such resistance when you started with agile methods? How have you overcome them? "
1120,How to Introduce A Small Project And Finish It Successfully,"I'm trying to find a way to propose a project for our company, and I've never done that before, within a year of work, but have lots of plans/projects in mind to do things automatically.  Sometimes, I would go beyond the norms of the company (whenever I have free time or at home, I would create an app). Creating a simple application that would take about two weeks to program. However, I see myself losing traction and motivation because of lack of support to finish the project, thus losing motivation to present them. (It is hard to get it done).  I've been thinking that in order to have the correct motivation, the company I'm working for should support the project first, then create the application after approval.  In the back of my head, I would also think that the users would just end up not using the app, although I think it could be easier to use the application for efficient communication, but even for just small reasons (like another reason for the user to memorize a username and password to login), it can end to the lack of participation in using the app, leaving the project unsuccessful.  I have learned project management in school, but have not really seen anybody perform the task successfully from point A to point B. Is there any effective steps that I can follow from successful project managers out there?  What tools do I need to consider in each step for effectivity?  Thanks. "
1121,How to improve communication problem facing in corporate culture,"I am experiencing difficulties in conveying my message when debating topics (mostly office-related issues) due to interruption by others. My nature is such that I carefully listen when others talk and wait for them to stop, but due to this nature, I am facing problems - even when logically I am in a strong position.  In discussions, people around me just keep talking nonstop and if I try to interrupt them by sharing my views or by asking questions, still they continue to talk. It is difficult for me to behave in same manner.  The issue is that people around me focus on that person's views when I interrupt him or when he interrupts me. I am wondering what could be the reason. Is it due to my voice being quieter than others? Is it because I speak slowly as compared to others so they get the chance to interrupt me? Et cetera. "
1122,Project Online - Enterprise Custom Field Not Calculating Formula Correctly?,"I am new to MS Project (~1 week experience) and could use some help with an Enterprise Custom Field I'm trying to create. I'm using Project through Project Web App in Office 365 (I assume this is Project 2016?) and trying to create an Enterprise Custom Field at the Project level of type Text to calculate a Project Size based on Work. I have created the following formula in my custom field:  IIf([Work] &gt; 1000, ""XL"", IIf([Work] &gt; 160, ""L"", IIf([Work] &gt; 40, ""M"", ""S"")))   Work is input at the Task level in Hours and is displayed at the Project level in Hours in my view in Project Center. My expectation is that the Work displayed at the project level is a sum of Work that has been input at the Task level for all tasks associated to the project and thus I should be able to use this formula to automatically populate my Project Size field. What I'm actually seeing is that some projects display nothing in Project Size (even though they have non-zero values for Work on tasks) and any project that actually displays a value always displays XL.  Am I missing something about how Enterprise Calculated Fields work in Project or is there something wrong in my formula syntax? Thanks in advance for any assistance.  Update: I added another calculated field (Numeric) that has a formula of [Work]. When I added it to my Project Center view, none of the projects had a value in this column. I went into a project for which I already had 1 placeholder task created and deleted the task. I then added the task back with the same information as the deleted task and saved/published it. After saving/publishing, the project still has no value in the Project Size column, however, my new calculated field is populated with the correct value of Work (in minutes as @Tom-Boyle stated). In addition, if I go back into the project and select Project Details from the left navigation, I do see a correctly calculated Project Size on that page. "
1123,Does Brooks Law hold for other fields as much as software development?,Brooks Law basically states that adding people to an already late software project makes it later. But does it hold for other fields as well? I'd imagine in a construction project it would probably be almost completely expelled because the work requires less of an understanding of the project as a whole to contribute to. But does it hold in scientific fields? Do managers in other fields use similar maxims? 
1124,How can an EV be calculated when there are different versions of a project plan?,"There is a project manager who is trying to come up with a way to calculate EV under a specific situation where there is a project management system which allows different versions of project plans.   The PMs starts with a initial project plan, cost are allocated to different tasks across different period, at the end of each month, PMs review their project plan and revise the plan according, this includes revising the project structure (adding/removing tasks) and project costs. During the running of the project, various cost are also charged to the project.   Here is an example of the project:  Revision 0 (cost/schedule plan):   month  |  1  |  2  task-1 | 100 | 200  task-2 | 200 | 100   Revision 1 (revised at the end of month 1)  month  |  1  |  2 task 1 | 200 | 200  task 2 | 200 | 100   Revision 2 (revised at end of month 2)  month  |  1  |  2 task 1 | 200 | 300  task 2 | 200 | 100    Actual Project Cost:  month  |  1  |  2  task-1 | 200 | 300  task-2 | 200 | 100    In this case, how can the PM modify the formula (shown below) to calculate the EV in this situation? Is there a better formula to use in this situation?   Here is the formula the PM is working with:  PV= PV of previous plan  EV= (actual cost Todate)/(total cost of new plan) * (PV according to previous plan)  AC = actual cost to-date.   "
1125,What should I do/study in high school if I want to be a software project manager?,I'm in high school and I'm curious about what I can do now to increase my knowledge about software management. What should I know about software management to better my chances of becoming a manager? How can I get 'real-world' experience at this stage that's as valuable as possible? 
1126,Technical Spec: Is more detail help or hindrance?,"When writing a full Technical Spec - defining in details what every part of the system will do, show and look like - does it help to state the obvious?  Let's take the easiest example:  A Login Screen needs fields for username &amp; password and their limitations. Those details need to be described.  But (assuming you've never done this before and can't copy from another spec) does it suffice to say: Include ""lost password link"" and assume the engineers are mature enough to know what to do.  Or should it go into the details of what happens when you click on that link, what the text of each stage says and what the arbitrary timeout limits are?  Or should it say ""...and behave like ____________ does, and a pointer to some other product?  Would there be any advantage to writing 2 - 3 pages with all the details, or will this type of detail be counter-productive, similar to micro-management? "
1127,How to Give Better Estimations to Customers,"We are working in an environment where customers give us thick requirement documents and they expect the technical team to do an estimation on the whole requirement. Once they receive our estimates, they can approach the budget team to ask for the money according to the estimated effort. They have been doing this for more than 15 years, and recently there have been some talk to move to a more agile process.  This practice of BIG estimation up front will be the first thing that they have to deal with among other things. The big question that they are trying to solve right now is ""how can they advise the customers that we can't give them full estimates up front?"" Agile process relies on simple, easy to estimate stories, where each story carries a certain estimates - well at least this is how stories are defined in XP.  Following XP principals, the technical team should not produce a big estimate up front, rather they should break up the requirement into stories. If this is the case, how can the customers get full estimates and ask for budget?  Is this where Agile process need to be tailored, or mixed with another practice to make things work? "
1128,Writing stories for SAP,"Perhaps this will get criticised for being technical, but SO seems the wrong place for it.  If you are running/involved in a project with SAP developers, how do you/they write stories for it? What do the stories usually look like?  To be specific, I'm (not an SAP developer but I am...) referring to technical stories which specify changes/additions to web services provided by SAP to client applications.  Our team tend to write good stories, but when the SAP technical stories get written it turns into the legacy style of writing stories and, more often than note, is a dump of the knowledge the person writing the story has with notes to say ""change this."" It's not digestible by anyone else. "
1129,"Shall I use my project management style when I'm substituting for my colleague, while he is away?","It is vacation period again, and I was asked to help out with a project while my colleague was on vacation. I don't know too much about the project - unfortunately we aren't that transparent -, but I know the people involved - we are located in the same area -, and I know the technology.  The way, I'm approaching project management problems, differs from the way, how my colleague does it. There's nothing wrong with this, because I believe that an organization needs diversity on certain levels, but now this diversity will appear in a project and only for a short amount of time, and this concerns me a bit.  For example, there's a meeting style in place, which I consider as not effective, but the colleagues are fine with it. If I change this, it will cause some disturbance in the projects life, which can be good for the project (they'll learn something new), or can be a risk (they'll slow down). This is not just about this particular meeting, there is the responding to emails, delegation, authority, saying no, saying yes and the list goes on.  I cannot switch between styles as fast as I would like, so I'm not quite sure how to proceed. Shall I use my style? Shall I follow my colleagues style, although I don't agree with it? "
1130,Project Management templates - Official standards across industry,"Does anyone know if, according to PMI, or any other PM certification, there are official templates for project management artifacts.  I am interested in the following documentation:   Project charter Functional specifications Non-functional specifications RACI matrix Highlevel technical requirements   I have found various templates online, however I am not sure if there are any officially standardized templates that could be adopted on a PMO level?  Can anyone recommend a PM professional site, which provides such artifacts or a book where such can be found?   Thank you.  "
1131,Can separate roles in DSDM Atern be handled by the same person?,"In the DSDM Atern project delivery framework roles fit into the following three categories:   Project Level Solution Development Team, and Other   The diagram below shows how an Atern team is structure:    For example, in the Solution Development Team we have the roles of the Business Ambassador and the Business Analyst(s).  I appreciate that the Business Ambassador's role is more focused on the day-to-day communication between the project and the business whereas the Business Analyst role facilitates the communication between the developers (technical roles) and other business roles.  There are many organisations that insist on assigning these roles to two different people. However, in smaller organisations where the resources are limited in all categories -i.e., there is no enough people to fulfil every business role; could the same person be assigned to both roles?  What are the risks or limitations of merging these two roles? Are there any (other) roles that lend themselves to being covered by the same people? Are there any that definitely shouldn't be covered by the same person?  "
1132,Should you give developer(s) bounty/bonus for his/her result?,"How would you profit the work of a software developer? I would also say team, but I speak partly about single developer and partly about the whole. I have seven years in the developing scene, with mostly all projects for internal usage of the companies itself.   I haven't still seen this kind of profit/bonus/wager-strategy for a developer's work, where I worked myself. With that say I think there are more developers out there who meet same situation, not to make the question localized.  If the development process is tied to some sort of salary or an application that sells per distribution, profit can be more natural to implement, or already have implemented. Profit-sharing of the business-win in overall is not a discussion of this (even if it fits, I refer to profits specific for the specific worker/work).  I understand that we can't talk values in terms of money, but at least how to measure a value of a work, i.e. dignity and complexity of work.   I think about a developer who has a generally high morality for work. She dies before dead-lines,  doesn't leave unsolved threads (at least not willingly), is highly willing to learn for better result, etc. This does not automatically mean that she works efficiently and right on spot all the time. Just a side note for an employer's thought about a bonus program.  And ok! Who wants a robot? But I think a bounty or profit for finished work will gain    More accurate threads (because she knows she doesn't get them back if they got status Complete. Developer knows where the wallet can be helped, behind an extra work on a project.   If the project manager is too busy for continuous following the status of projects, the developer can feel responsibility for follow-up. Also there are up to the developer really finish the threads/points because he/she don't want them back! "
1133,should UX decision be approved by PM?,"Does PM get to have final say about UX?  I am very disturbed by this. throughout my entire career I was really into UX (if before UX was coined). But every time my feedback was shot down by PMs.   I've been to seminars, I've read books and researched online. As far as I understand it, PMs are responsible for meeting the project's requirements in the given deadline. The UX designer however is responsible for the UX vision.   It seems logical to me that these 2 roles collide in some way, but who should have the final say about UX?   If I gathered some UX relevant tasks for my team, should I approve it with the PM? "
1134,Are Delighters equivalent to Gold Plating?,Is there a link / similarity between the delighters mentioned in Kano model  and gold plating? Do both these terms define the same concept? Can a delighter be a cause for a project failure? 
1135,Is there a need for project restrictions?,"I'm currently developing some project management software and I just wanted to ask few things.   Is it necessary to restrict other members from creating/editing/deleting tasks even if they're not the one who created it?

Please help, I'll wait for your answers.. "
1136,How to cope with the Hawthorne effect and sprint improvements?,"Hawthorne effect: the phenomenon in which subjects in behavioral studies change their performance in response to being observed.  Background: I'm using Kanban as a tool to analyse and improve the team's internal process. After each sprint (2 weeks) the team suggests and implements improvements, some of them based on the data gathered with the cumulative flow chart.  Given that, what is a good time frame to analyse if an improvement made during a sprint really helps the team, without overlapping with the observed results of other improvements? What are the variables involved that can make the effect last longer or shorter? (project type, team structure, sprint duration, etc.) Should I try to make it last longer or it can damage the production with fake efficient processes in the long run? "
1137,Issues with the Iterative Development Model,"I am the Product Manager for a software company.  We use an iterative development model (similar to Agile) to separate out versions of our software (i.e. 7.3, 7.4, 7.5, etc.)  Prior to each version, we make a design plan based on a combination of customer requests and internal features that we draw up based on market research.  While this is definitely a better approach than the waterfall model, it is also presenting some significant challenges.   It is committing our development timeline for a long amount of time. Right now if any of our customers make a development request, depending on the priority level, we may not be able to get it to them in a complete and tested version of the software for over a year.  This is also affecting our ability to respond to changes in the market.  We have added resources, but as we get more and more requests, we are committing more of our time in the future.  What is the best way to ensure that our development timeline includes all of the items we are bound to complete for our clients, without overcommiting our future time?   If we try to shorten the development timeline and get versions out faster,         this invariably leads to more versions that have to be maintained. Finding a bug in 7.3, for example, means that same bug would have to be identified and fixed in 7.4, 7.5, etc. How can we reduce the number of versions when there are more bugs?   In your experience, what are the best solutions to these issues with the iterative development model? "
1138,First business analysis document for quote,"My client requested me to send them a quote for man/day pricing. Their needs and flows are clear.  What I am planning to do is describing the modules and relations. Then I will put all these outputs in a definitive diagram (beside the quote document).  What kind of document do you suggest me to prepare? A work flow diagram or a basic flowchart or another document?   I organized, analysed client needs. What is the best method for presenting analysis information back to the client? "
1139,PMs treat UX differently - why?,"As a java developer, if I want to refactor some code, I can usually just go ahead and do it. I might need to approve it with team lead or head of R&amp;D, but generally, if it is a small refactoring task (make static methods to singelton) and the team is fine with it, I can go ahead with it.   If my code was part of API, obviously it would have better supervision, but it is not. As long as the code works fine, and the tests pass right, everything is well. PMs are never involved in this process because they do not always have the experties, interest or ""jurisdiction"".   This is somehow intuitive to a lot of companies.   Sometimes UX is like a refactor to the UI.  We have a web application. Our application has a page where you select a value from a drop box and then click on button ""execute"" which opens a confirm dialog. A UX expert told me the ""Confirm"" dialog is bad UX and not required. Users will not select a value from the dropbox AND click execute without meaning to do it.   I talk to head of R&amp;D, we decide to go ahead with the task. We make sure it doesn't break any API and that all tests pass and we complete the task.   If it was a big UX change, we would have notified the users (like google did with instant search), but it is not. Moreover, this is the first version! so no customers to notify. But generally, It is a UX responsibility to make sure users have a nice transition.   But the PM is angry.   Why? Why do PMs treat UX differently? It seems unfair.  I mean it is obvious this is because UX is visible unlike code refactoring, but why do PMs treat it differently?  Even more so it seems to me unhealthy to the company.   Am I wrong here? Should PMs have so much control over UX? Is there no best practice for this in the UX/PM world to stop these roles from colliding all the time?  "
1140,How can I track team member utilization across a range of projects?,"I have a fixed-sized team (with fixed-hours) and products, more than the team can handle. At any given time, while my resources are working on one product, requests keep flowing in about work on other products--most of them with conflicting timelines--and I find it difficult to predict when  we can take up the new task based on resource availability.  I want to be able to answer the question ""Which resource is working on what product release till what time?"" at a glance. How can I do that? "
1141,Gathering feedback on performance as a Scrum Master,"As a ScrumMaster, what techniques would you recommend to gather feedback from the Team Members?  What criteria should the Team Members, the Product Owner and, other stakeholders take into account in order to assess the performance of the ScrumMaster? "
1142,Is there an Agile or Scrum method without Iterations / Sprints?,"I just had a little discussion about this with a few coworkers but we did not come to a conclusion yet. We have a bunch of projects that are actively maintained and developed using scrum, with fixed two week sprints, TFS backlog integration, etc.  We also have a separate project, called Mobiltec.Framework, which is intended to be an extension to the default .Net framework (most of our projects are C# projects). This utility project is intended to support every other project in the company with general functionality not bound to any specific product, and is located in it's own TeamProject in TFS, independent of any other projects.  We are in the process of starting anew with this one, in a migration to TFS 2013, and I immediately wondered:     What TFS process template will I use with this?   This is obviously specific to TFS, but I think the question stands generic enough: what is the best method to use to develop such on-demand utility project? Scrum makes absolutely no sense to me for it. Features are rarely added to it, and it is quite stable. There is no concept of sprint, and we don't have a special team to handle the project at all (any developer in the whole company could theoretically add things to it, if they are not product specific).  I feel there should still be a backlog of sorts with tasks / user stories mapped to it to at least track what is being done, but I fail to see how I should integrate this in the whole agile pipeline. Should I just completely ignore the 'iterations' idea (both conceptually and in TFS) and just develop and release directly from the main source, creating user stories and bugs along the way?  Is there an example of a project like this, in which the functionalities are all on demand and there is no intrinsic concept of sprints or iterations, on which I could base our project on? "
1143,Can bug trackers be used for tracking tasks other than programming?,"I work as an electrical engineer, and sometimes when work gets busy (read: most of the time) there are so many various tasks and things to remember to take care of later that it can get difficult to track.  In the past I've tried using a notebook, email, or outlook to keep track of tasks, but eventually it gets too unweildly and difficult to manage.  Lately I've been thinking about trying to use a bug tracker such as Mantis or Bugzilla to keep track of my tasks and work (instead of programming bugs). The reason I feel hesitant to do this is that all of these bug trackers are, well, designed with programming in mind.  Some examples I would track:   Oscillator takes too long to stabilize after power-up Write documentation for user updates to software Measure the impedance on the input lines Simulate the power circuit etc.   Can a bug tracker be used as a task manager for things other than programming? Can a ""remember to check this later"" notepad be used for things other than programming? Would this be a viable long term strategy? "
1144,What mechanisms promote continuous improvement on Agile teams?,I'm in the process of comparing scrum teams to kanban teams and I wanted to answer the following questions:  What scrum processes/tools promote continuous improvement?  What kanban processes/tools promote continuous improvement?  Is there a fundamentally different approach in how scrum and kanban achieve continuous improvement? 
1145,How Do You Calculate Schedule Compression Ratio?,"Schedule Compression Ratio   How do you calculate schedule compression ratio?   When and why would you do it? What does it tell you?

Since there is a bounty on this question, answers should cover all 3 bulleted questions and provide a thorough explanation. "
1146,What are some differences between Scrumban and Kanban?,"It seems to me that scrumban is just a form of Kanban with additional tools like the cadence, planning, retrospective, and daily standup thrown in.  Why is scrumban turning into another branded methodology?  It doesn't seem to me that scrumban is taking anything away from the Kanban philosophy, its just a hybrid of scrum and kanban tools.  What does scrumban do to differentiate itself from these other 2 models both in practice and theory?  Perhaps another way to phase the question; how is scrumban different from any other Scrumbut approach? "
1147,How to communicate technical obstacles?,"For my project management class we have been proposed with a case and have been asked to come up with a proposed solution.

1149,Which CRM systems work well with Redmine?,"I am using Redmine for managing a small team of developers. To organize our contacts, we need a CRM system soon. Are there any CRM systems that have a Redmine integration? Is it possible to link Redmine-tickets to contacts or phone-minutes? "
1150,Creating an Agile Estimate for an Earned Value Management PMB,"Earned Value Management is predicated on the creation of a Performance Management Baseline (PMB). The PMB can be thought of as a super estimate that defines what work is planned to be done by what date and at what cost. Many companies spend a tremendous amount of time creating these super estimates since contracts are written against them, customer expectations are set against them and a project can be judged to be a success or failure benchmarked against the PMB.  (And in a world of constrained budgets,  underperforming against the PMB can mean death for a project.)  There are many Agile criticisms of creating this level of estimating.  For example, I was listening to an old interview with Mike Cohn on the Controlling Chaos podcast about Agile Estimating.  Towards the beginning of the interview he talks about the fear developer’s have of giving estimates. He said an estimate is pretty much used to beat a developer over the head with (as an attempt at “management.”) He also brought up the point that people spend too much time estimating assuming that an estimate is a firm a commitment -which it unfortunately does often get turned into.    Given that EVM is a requirement for many organizations, how can a contract be written or stakeholder expectations and stakeholder sponsorship be developed in such a way that accounts for the inherent uncertainty in the estimating process? How can PMB’s be made more realistic, while still giving stakeholders the governance they require? "
1151,JIRA Statuses and Assigned users,"I am wondering how you guys handle changes to Assignee and status changes. In other system we have had multiple assignees.  Example:  I pickup a work item from the sprint back log. Change status to development, and assign to myself.  When I am done I move the ticket to ready for test, then qa picks it up and assigns their self?  Is this how the rest of you do this?  "
1152,How Feasible is Agile in Large Department of Defense Projects?,"There is an interesting discussion that has been reignited by Jeff Sutherland about the U.S. Department of Defense using Agile project management.  While it seems that there is broad consensus as to the value of using Agile on government projects, Glen Alleman brings up some practical, contracting/regulations issues.  Given those concerns, is Agile feasible for large DoD projects?  If so, how can the issues be addressed? "
1153,Who is responsible for people resourcing in a project?,"The organization currently has ad-hoc processes regarding the resourcing of people. This becomes a challenge especially if there are the same people across multiple projects.   There isn't a resource function nor a program management office, not that I would expect the latter being responsible for overall resourcing of people especially if this includes operational staff, vendors, etc.   Hence the question, is the Project Manager responsible for resourcing?   How should this work ideally i.e. the ideal scenario? "
1154,How to manage a project schedule based on Late Start dates?,"We finished planning a project a month ago and since then have had four formal changes pushing out start dates to the latest possible. Scope change isn't a factor, rather the root cause appears to be a general lack of resources for all the projects the different functional units are assigned.   I would like to figure out a way to avoid having so many project changes when the scope of the project isn't changing, it just seems like a lot of unnecessary effort. A couple of alternatives that I can think of are:   Define schedules based off of Late Start dates rather than the MS Project default of early start date. The pro here is that it is simple to interpret (only one date is visible to stakeholders) and reflects the likely reality; the con is that there is a reduced tolerance for delay as more tasks will get on the critical path and there is a human tendency to not start work before you ""have to"". Define schedules with a range of possible start dates (Early to Late Starts). The pro here is that it gives more leverage to push the team to start work before the latest possible date; the con is that I am pretty confident at least some in project oversight positions will have a hard time buying into date ranges and I'm not sure people will actually start work before the Late Start date. (As an aside, I've used date ranges to report predicted deliverable completion, which worked well but I don't think I've ever had anything finish before the latest possible date....)   My goal is to get the schedule closer to what the end reality is most likely to be on the first iteration. Are these viable approaches? What other solutions would meet my goals?  "
1155,Estimation given in days and need to plan in Agile,"The client internally feels that this is about 500 developer days worth of work and there could potentially be 4 developers (or pairs of developers) that work in parallel. We need to go back to them with a proposal work in agile. Later on if new work comes up it will be taken up accordingly.  But the point is how to plan for this in agile.  Should I take    1 day as 1 story point , 1 Sprint = 2 weeks., Velocity = 16 story points (4 people * 4 days), 1 release = 3 sprints,   And calculate accordingly??  I don't have total of story points. I just have total developer days and now I have to estimate. "
1156,How much automated test coverage should I aim for in an agile project?,"I have generally used manual testing in my projects. In the proposal plan, I am going to introduce automated testing this time.  Few things I am going to add:   Unit Testing using Junit Test cases Continuous Integration using Hudson or Cruise Control StackExchangeLinkIReferred   For Integration and System Testing, how much automation I can do? My project is a web project. JSP->Spring->Hibernate->Oracle  It seems there are some tools like FitNesse which are useful for agile purposes.  As per my understanding, for screen capture, we should not be using automation as screen often changes but other areas can be fully automated even if there are additions in each sprint by tools like FitNesse.  Can you please share your suggestions? "
1157,Scrum and Organizational Structure,"I am working in a company that wants to migrate their development process to Scrum.  The company did not have much of a development process up to now but had well organised sales and marketing departments.  At the same time the company wants to start an R&amp;D department in the East Coast from scratch (currently there is an R&amp;D dept in the West Coast).  The question I 've been asked is to propose a new organizational structure for the company that will encompass the new development team in the east coast and foster development in the company.  The company works in different projects at the same time, (possibly unrelated) and plans to have around 30 developers in the near future.  I proposed a scheme which is project based, where each project consists of the basic Scrum roles (Product owner, Scrum Master, and Development Team).   Teams WILL be spread across sites, with some of the members in the East coast and some of them in the West coast. One reason is that for some projects there is prior knowledge of existing platforms required and this knowledge is in the West Coast whereas the main development workforce will be in the East Coast. Scrum master will be located at the site were the majority of the development workforce of the project will be.  I expect this to gradually change as development efforts are moved in the East coast, but this will not take place immediately.  Projects will be coordinated by a person that assigns priorities to projects and can move people from one team to another (The scrum of scrum master).  I believe that it is incredibly risky to do all of this things at once but this is a decision I cannot alter.  The questions I have are the following:   Do you think the above setup is reasonable? If not what do you think are the downsides In terms of HR management, who should be responsible and what would be his/her role in the chart. For example, who should decide on hiring/letting staff, making staff appraisals? Will a separate manager be required? where does he lie in the whole picture? I think a separate manager will be required in the East coast dealing with day-to-day activities. (Requests for leave? appraisals? anything a typical PM would do?). How do you think will be the best way to handle this?  "
1158,Why Project Management is so hard?,"I know a lot of Project Managers and they are all over 30 years old.  Are all project managers like that? I mean, is this about getting more experience than at least 7-8 years?    Or being a Project Manager is so hard? What do you think? "
1159,Should projects always be product-orientated from the start?,"I've been learning the PRINCE2 methodology which advocates a product-orientated approach to managing projects. This seems sensible to me.  However, in hindsight, looking back at projects I've been involved with, I've realised that some of these have only defined the product in suitable detail towards the end of the project. So for the first 75% of the project, the only thing known about the product is that it will be a publication of some kind. It is only then in the last 25% of the project where this gets defined in detail (for example, the publication will be 2 documents accompanied by 5 wall-sized posters).  This seems risky to me: since expectations are not being laid out until right towards the end of the product. If someone interpreted the publication to be a video, rather than documents, then we have an issue. On the other hand, I appreciate that not defining the product towards later in the project could be allowing more time for innovation and creativity.  My questions are:  Should a project always provide a view on the detailed specification of a product right from the beginning and manage changes to this specification using a change management process?  Or does it simply need to work out the right point in the process where detailed specifications are needed? If so, how do you understand where this point in the process is? "
1160,What KPI's or OKR's do you use for individual software engineers?,"As a company, we're trying to push more quarterly OKR's into the individual level.  We've had success with quarterly goals at the team level (IE code coverage, # of successful releases, up time, % crash free users, etc), and we have long term professional individual goals for career growth.  However, we're new to pushing goals down to the individual quarter to quarter.  What are the metrics you use to track engineers growth and achievement quarter to quarter?    Before going any further, I should recognize some of the similar questions that have been asked on this topic, and my agreement with the negative answers -    I whole-heartedly agree that tracking lines of code is a horrible, terrible metric.  There's probably a 100 reasons for this, a few of them included here: [website]I also agree that attempting to track bugs written / solved / etc. is an anti pattern.  Good answer here that I agree with: [website]I asked in a different question about tracking story points achieved per engineer.  I'm still mixed on these answers, but worth calling out the conversation exists: Are story points achieved a good individual quarterly goal?   So given all the things that are bad ideas for showing / tracking individual achievement and growth quarter to quarter, what are the right ways to do this? "
1161,Should we include Graphic Team into Scrumban Process?,"Our team familiar with traditional SDLC process like waterfall. So, We wanna step to scrumban. (we think it suitable for us.) But we have something to concern and not sure what is best practice for us. Here is our resource.   Graphic Team (5 People) Business Analyst Team (3 People) Develop Team (2 Team, 4 People/Team) Test Team (2 People)   Should I include Graphic Team and Business Analyst to Scrumban? what's the best way? Thank you in advance for your suggestion. "
1162,What are the responsibilities in a Scrum of Scrums?,"In an Agile environment, where there are multiple Scrum teams, I'm told that each team can nominate an ""ambassador"" to represent them in the ""Scrum of Scrums"" stand-up.  What happens when there is conflict (priorities, dependencies, technical standards etc.) between 2 or more teams?   How do the multiple teams maintain a co-ordinated direction when different team members may attend the SoS each time? Is there an overall product owner? "
1163,How to manage PMO?,"We have a PMO of three project managers.  Is there a book, a course, a blog or anything like that on the topic of managing project managers?  I tried Quora earlier, and the main line of the answers was ""Project managers should manage themselves"". That's true, yet I guess we can help them.  For example, double checking projects' quality standards, incoming and outgoing payment schedule, checking that all the documents are in the place, etc.  For now, we will go on with building our own practices, but is there a guide or a list of best practices? "
1164,Are efforts to improve quality an impediment to achieving schedule in Scrum?,"Let me begin by highlighting couple of roles of a Scrum Master as quoted by the Scrum Alliance:     The ScrumMaster also works with the development team to find and   implement the technical practices needed to get to Done at the end of   each sprint.      Another responsibility of the ScrumMaster as quoted there include   removing impediments to the team’s progress. These impediments may be   external to the team (such as a lack of support from another team) or   internal (such as the product owner not knowing how to properly   prepare the product backlog). That said, the ScrumMaster fosters   self-organization, meaning that the team itself should remove issues   wherever possible.   Some other responsibilities mentioned include helping a PO creating and maintaining Product Backlogs, facilitating meetings, and making sure Scrum process is strictly followed.  I work in an Agile environment with 6 Scrum teams, as a developer in one of the teams. We follow Scrum professionally and as expected, the scrum master chases developers to get all user stories finished by the end of the sprint, as we commit the delivery right during sprint planning (without really touching on the technical aspects). Now obviously, the scrum master is not expected to know anything about code or how time consuming/difficult a user story is; all he wants is the user stories finished.  Now let's consider what Robert Martin has to say in his book Clean Code:     Most managers want good code, even when they are obsessing about the   schedule. They may defend the schedule and requirements with passion,   but that's their job, It's your job to defend the code with equal   passion.   Alright, so here goes my descriptive question: We all know writing clean and maintainable code could be time consuming depending on the task (for example architectural work usually require lots of time and efforts). Now, if writing clean code and maintaining them is an important aspect in software development, why does Scrum assign Scrum Masters (who don't have any programming knowledge) the role of getting developers to quickly achieve 'Definition of Done' before the end of sprint? A lot of times due to this, most developers end up not bothering much about writing reusable quality code and just write a slew of code just so that the feature is implemented. Rather than protecting developers from impediments, wouldn't it be appropriate to conclude that a scrum master is an impediment towards writing clean code?  Now someone could argue saying that scrum masters are supposed to do this so that the developers stick to their commitments and get the features delivered. But I think we have already touched on the point that scrum masters basically foster self-organization, and that the team itself should remove issues wherever possible. Its quite obvious that if the team doesn't deliver the features as committed, then they shall ultimately bear the brunt from the higher management, the thought of which should automatically drive the developers to work towards their commitments whilst not hindering them from writing good code.  My point is not against having scrum masters, I definitely agree with all other responsibilities of a Scrum Master other than racing developers to get the tasks done.  Am I justified in expecting the Scrum Master to allow me needed time to write reusable code? "
1165,How to do a SWOT Analysis,"I am an undergraduate in an intro management class. I have to work in a group and complete a SWOT analysis on a well known company. I understand the theory but how do you actually apply this? How do you figure out the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats of a company you have no connection or experience with? I have no experience in business or management.  "
1166,Leveling Algorithm appears to be taking Total Slack into account when it should not. Why?,"I have set Leveling Order to be Priority, Standard.  Therefore I expected the  hierarchy of leveling tests to be as follows   Is the Priority of any of the contending tasks 1000? Are any of the contending tasks Manually scheduled? Have any of the contending tasks actually started? Which of the contending tasks has highest Priority? Are any of the contending tasks Predecessors to other tasks? Which of the contending tasks has the LEAST Total Slack? Which of the contending tasks has the earlier Start date? Do any of the contending tasks have date constraints set? Which of the contending tasks has the longest Duration? Which of the contending tasks has the lowest ID?   My schedule consists of about 50 projects each with 5 sub-tasks.  Each project has a unique Priority Score with the highest being 950.  All sub-tasks for a project share the same Priority as the project, and each Project sub-task except the first has a predecessor to determine its dates.  All projects are independent of each other.  No project of sub-task has a Priority of 1000 and none are Manual and none have an Actual start date.    Given the above, I expected that Total Slack (item 6) would be irrelevant in my case as I thought Priority and Predecessors (items 4 and 5) would always be sufficient to resolve any resource contentions.  However I have at least 2 instances where this is not working as expected.  In these cases sub-task A has a higher Priority than sub-task B, it is a Predecessor of another sub-task (as is sub-task B), but the available resource is being allocated by Leveling to sub-task B rather than sub-task A.  I have noticed that the Total Slack of B is lower than that of A.  In my case, given my schedule consists of 50 independent projects, Total Slack is not relevant, but of course Project does not ""know"" that.  However, with the above hierarchy (with Priority near the top) and given the Priority of A is higher than that of B, the ""Total Slack"" test should never need to be applied, should it?  All leveling should be determined by tests 1-5.  Or am I misunderstanding how this should work?  Thanks for any insights you can offer.  Eric "
1167,Level Remaining Resource Units,"My goal is to optimize resource usage when having priority tasks partially allocated.  MS Project 2007 simple two task scenario (My project has thousands of tasks) with automatic leveling:  ======------ Gantt Chart -----===== Task Name            | Work    | Duration  | Resource Name  |  Gantt ---------------------+---------+-----------+----------------+--------------------- Support QA Phase 1   | 8  hrs  | 16 hrs    | Alfred [50%]   |  @@@@@@@@ Develop Screen Login | 16 hrs  | 16 hrs    | Alfred         |          ######## (@ - partially allocated - # full allocation)  =====----- Task Usage -----===== Task Name              | Work   | D1 | D2 | D3 | D4 -----------------------+--------+----+----+----+---- Project                | 24 hrs | 4h | 4h | 8h | 8h     Support QA Phase 1   | 8 hrs  | 4h | 4h |    |          Alfred             | 8 hrs  | 4h | 4h |    |        Develop Screen Login | 16 hrs |    |    | 8h | 8h       Alfred             | 16 hrs |    |    | 8h | 8h     After the ""leveling"" Alfred can only start the screen development after the support is finished, since the development task requires 100% of units of Alfred. But obviously we can work during that QA Support. I'm trying to optimize Alfred time, something like this:  ======------ Gantt Chart -----===== Task Name            | Work    | Duration  | Resource Name  |  Gantt ---------------------+---------+-----------+----------------+--------------------- Support QA Phase 1   | 8 hrs   | 16 hrs    | Alfred [50%]   |  @@@@@@@@ Develop Screen Login | 8 hrs   | 20 hrs    | Alfred [*]     |  @@@@@@@@#### (@ - partially allocated - # full allocation)  =====----- Task Usage -----===== Task Name              | Work   | D1 | D2 | D3 | D4 -----------------------+--------+----+----+----+---- Project                | 24 hrs | 4h | 4h | 8h |    Support QA Phase 1   | 8 hrs  | 4h | 4h |    |          Alfred             | 8 hrs  | 4h | 4h |    |        Develop Screen Login | 16 hrs | 4h | 4h | 8h |      Alfred             | 16 hrs | 4h | 4h | 8h |      So Alfred only works at 50% of its time while support task is occurring, and then can go full speed ahead.  The simple solution is to go to task usage and do manual distribution, others involve splitting tasks. In both cases, in hundreds of tasks this prone to errors and tedious. ""Spliting remaing work"" only splits tasks that are interrupted by other priority tasks, so no help from here.  Can we, somehow, change the way leveling works so that it does also split the task usage? Is manual labor the only solution for this? (No project server) "
1168,"How does a ""rockstar"" performer integrate into an Agile team?","I have this issue for a while now: ""rockstars"" (e.g. a contractor or freelancer, who's very good technically) tend to be quite independent and reject any form of process. Many of them don't have the patience to learn about the process, as they focus on building things and are driven by tangible results.  But on the other hand, many of them don't work well in a team, as they feel restrained by the team, rules, even Agile frameworks (not even mentioning Scrum, because Scrum seems to be the devil for these guys).  My question is: how do you use Agile to make sure you keep these guys in the company? They are mostly very talented individuals, but how can you use the tools Agile offers to help them have their freedom but also work with others?  *I do realise this is more of a people / group dynamics question but I find that many issue come from creating an Agile team, rather than using the right practices with people that have no issue with using Agile. "
1169,Story Points flaw?,"Forgive me f this has been asked before, I read some similar questions (linked below), but didn't find the answer I was looking for.    Our team is fairly new to them and trying to figure out how to best apply them?  Here' the problem, per sprint;   A developer who is dealing with small tickets and requests might complete;       250 x XXS (1) = 250    The same developer who is working on a large feature  might complete;      1 x XL (20) = 20   How can you measure a teams velocity when this is the case?

1170,Involving a non participating Stakeholder,"My client has initiated the project and pledged to be an active participant in project activities. However, as project progressed, my queries on functionalities were not answered by the stakeholder. Delays were imminent. However questions were raised on delivery dates.  My question is how do I get the stakeholder to actually contribute knowledge and participate in the agile processes?  I felt my question is inline with the question here - How do you get stakeholders who don&#39;t care engaged?, However, I could not connect the answer to my question. "
1171,Managing scope creep in Agile,"I often get asked this question in the interview, and no matter what I answer the interviewers do not seem to get satisfied.  So, they start with asking how to manage scope creep in Project Management? I usually answer by telling that the requirements need to be clearly defined before the project starts, and if there is any change during the project then it has to go through a change control process which involves the change control board, etc etc  However, the next question they ask is, if you prevent scope creep from happening in the project how can you say that the project is Agile? Because agile is all about making changes to the project in an efficient way  How do you answer this question? Can you guys please give me some ideas on how to handle this? "
1172,How to write a user story involving artistic work?,"Using Scrum, what would be the way to define, structure and estimate a user story, containing work for an artist?  The main problem that I'm interested here is that an artistic story can take a long time to finish, due to the nature of the work.   For example, let's say I work in cross-functional team of 8-9 people on a highly visual 3D app (think video game).  I could write a user story like this one: ""As a user, I want a car to move through the map""  This story would involve the following tasks:   Make an approved concept art of the car Make an approved 3D model of the car Integrate the car model in the app Program the controls of the car   Other than the fact that the user story in itself is a little big, the problem is that the 2 first tasks are subjective, so the artist can take a long time doing iterations.  For example, he could create a concept art in a day, show it to the creative director, being asked to change some things, redo another concept, change it again because he's not satisfied and then show it again to the creative director. Only then the concept is approved. Now the second task can start.  Even if we break the user story in smaller parts, the time to complete it can still be greater than the sprint, or the effort estimation could be way off. Also, breaking this story in smaller parts is making an ""horizontal slice"" of the app and not a ""vertical one"" as would be better.  What do you suggest in this situation? "
1173,How to facilitate communication and peer reviews on a distributed scrum team?,"We have a Scrum team of 3 developers, a scrum master, and a product owner.  Everyone works out of their home (except the product owner who works at his organization's headquarters).  In the past, we have used formal inspections for peer reviewing design and code concepts to facilitate communication among the development team.  However, the peer reviews often get put on the back burner in favor of implementation.  The peer reviews turn into ""This is what I've done, let's document the review and move on"" instead of ""This is what I'm thinking about doing, what do you all think?""  We use Skype and Webex to communicate w/ screen-sharing, and we upload our design / code review documents to Sharepoint for easy access.  One of our long-term goals is to be appraised at CMMI level 3, so documenting and analyzing the results of our peer reviews works towards the verification of our work products.  Although, I do not want to advocate peer reviews for the sake of documentation.  I would like for the development team to want to communicate with their peers.  I do not want to bog the team down with having to document every communication, but I do want to capture the benefits of peer reviews to analyze for process improvement.  Questions:   How can a distributed agile team facilitate communication without it feeling like a chore? What software products exist that can facilitate communication across a distributed team? What methods of peer review would match our goals of people-over-processes while effectively documenting the results for future analysis   Just for perspective, I am a junior developer who was moved from a separate project to start a QA branch for the company, so I am researching how to implement CMMI with our Scrum project management.  We are working with very limited resources.  Thank you. "
1174,When to add tasks to stories and how to estimate tasks?,In our agile team we frequently encounter the issue where the Scrum Master points out that all of our stories should be fully tasked and estimated prior to an iteration and once these tasks have been added no more tasks/stories can be added during the iteration. In my opinion this is very difficult to accomplish unless the item of work is fully understood. In my experience trying to fully task a story prior to actually working on it is difficult because :    I don't know what the tasks will actually involve until I familiarize myself with the code in that particular area. Even when I familiarize myself I will be constantly reading doc's etc to improve my understanding and look for efficiency's thereby possibly making my original tasks redundant.    Perhaps this is not very agile of me but it feels like the best method of adding value to the work being done. Am I just being too rigid or is there a common approach to solve this issue? Is this issue common among users of this site as it seems quite common to developers I've worked with? 
1175,Do you use the WBS or Project Program to structure tasks in MS Project?,"When I first started using Microsoft Project, I took it for granted that I should replicate the WBS in the task list and use that to structure my work packages. After working with Project a little while, I'm wondering if I should structure my work packages into phases instead (the project Program).  Right now, all my leaf tasks are the work packages. All summary tasks are elements from the WBS, arranged in the same hierarchy as the WBS.  Should I have the summary tasks be project phases instead? In this way, the work packages would be listed (more or less) chronologically instead of the deliverable based structure of the WBS.  In this setup I would use the WBS field to map the work package to the WBS maintained elsewhere. When sorting by the WBS field, MS Project shows the hierarchical relationship, so you could still view the WBS hierarchy in Project.  Does anyone have experience using this approach? Is this how MS Project is designed to be used? "
1176,Should all team members be assigned user stories?,"This is a very basic question but I don't see any answers on it yet.  Scenario: We did sprint planning and I noticed some one saying      Not all developers have a task to do. We need to add more tasks so that everybody has work.   I have a problem with that for the following reasons:   If our velocity is 60 and you add tasks so that everybody has work you may end up with going way over your average velocity, you are setting yourself up for failure. With agile I would rather promote peer programming instead of everybody doing a task and when the sprint ends we have more tasks that is in development than those that are closed.   Idea Maybe stories should be split so that each team member has a task but in all they are working towards the same goal.  Question: Do you give each team member a user story or do you plan according to the velocity and then the team should work together to deliver a potentially releasable sprint rather than a half completed sprint?  Do you have experience in this and how did you deal with it? "
1177,How to manage different detail levels in a project plan to be presented to different audiences?,"In any given project, a variety of detail levels are needed:   executive summary technical summary delivery team summary delivery details   How can these different levels of detail be contained and published in the same project plan (specifically using MS Project 2007) without the ""higher levels"" being able to drill-into the lower ones?  Is it possible with the tool, or would multiple project plans need to be kept to be able to share with the representatives of each level? "
1178,Order JIRA filter by position of the tasks in the backlog,"I have a custom filter defined by this query  project = ProjectName AND status in (""In Progress"", Open, Reopened) AND assignee in (currentUser()) AND sprint in openSprints() AND sprint not in futureSprints() ORDER BY updated DESC   As you can see, this filter gets all open tasks of the current active sprint of a specific project.  I'd like to order by the position of the tasks in the backlog list but I can't find any relevant information about this in the JIRA documentation, not in the fields reference nor in the functions reference  Just to be clear, I don't want to order them by Priority or Level but really by the order they appear in the backlog page.   There is another tricky detail is that (I think) sub-tasks don't actually have a positions in the backlog because they are simply not part of the backlog. Their parent tasks however are.  so to sum-up:   Is it possible (and how) to order by task's position in the backlog? Is it possible (and how) to order sub-tasks by their parent-task's position in the backlog?  "
1179,Ineffective Backlog Grooming and Sprint Planning,"I suspect that the problems on Scrum teams in my current organization supersede this one aspect, but wanted to focus the question more specifically to how Scrum can be done better than it is currently being done.  We are a new organization to Agile/Scrum and have many challenges.  We are horizontally stratified to the point of sheer lunacy where nearly every aspect of software and technology has been provided through some external enterprise platform team that monopolizes an incredibly specific aspect of an overall software system (Eg. ESB team, Reporting team, DBA team, Scheduled Tasks Team, Business Events Notification, etc...)  Our project is a hub of sorts with an absurd number of external interfaces spiderwebbing into and out of our software that we are trying to deliver.  We have many many many layers of abstraction from business and operations, to operation business analysts, to Product Owner, to business systems analysts that define detailed functional requirements in the form of user stories and acceptance criteria.  This project has a big budget so they formed off two scrum teams but to my extremely vocal objections the decision by the scrum master was to horizontally segregate the two scrum teams such that one scrum team deliver on user stories for stakeholders while the other scrum team delivers on more technical and interface stories in a digestable form for the other scrum team.  My unheeded objections were that a user story should be a full vertical slice otherwise we harm our ability to be cross functional.  The argument against mine is that even the simplest most atomized slice of business value could not be delivered in a two week sprint because of the obscene amount of external dependencies any one story calls for.  Instead the second team works ahead of the user story team.  This is all failing miserably in practice, but despite all of this the bigger problem still is that our backlog grooming and sprint planning sessions take 8+ hours to complete.  Our scrum master insists that we cannot end the meeting until enough stories are ready for the next sprint, no matter what.  Most of the stories just aren't ready in terms of requirements I feel to where the user story is clear and the acceptance criteria makes sense.  I am constantly trying to stifle extended deep dive technical discussions that technical folks in the room insist on talking to death about but usually I just give up after a while and let them talk through whatever anxieties they have.  Originally I tried taking a hard stance in the meetings and calling the story Not Ready and moving back to Backlog, however I was being lectured from the frustrated Product Owner that we are failing to bring anything useful at all into the next sprint.  Next I tried to call for a return to Sprint Zero because we just aren't ready to work on anything yet.  It is clear the Scrum Team needs more guidance on requirements and high level design, and being as I am responsible for system architecture, I agree that we are moving too fast for me to give the level of design detail that the technical folks feel they need to work on a story.  I try to make up for this by being completely available for questions or concerns during the sprint but it doesn't ease the anxiety that the team feels about the impending public humiliation that comes when they are in standup and have to admit that they don't know what to do and that their story is at risk yet again.  My call for Sprint Zero is unheeded by the Scrum Master who insists that we are not going to meet our strict regulatory deadlines of minimum scope if we ""waste time"" in Sprint Zero.  It is a completely immutable position that he refuses to step down from.  So our Backlog grooming and Sprint planning has devolved into 8+ hr sessions where we essentially try our best to piece together requirements and design details for each story, and where discussions can go in excess of 45 minutes on each story.  This whole experience has me wondering if Scrum just doesn't scale to large projects in practice.  What else can I do as a technical architect to help pull the project out of this vicious death spiral it found itself in?  How can I help the team get to a point where we can groom, slice and size a story in less than 10 minutes?  "
1180,Calculated duration in MS project task?,"I would like to add a ""Bugs"" task with a duration calculated from 20% of total project duration. Is this possible in MS Project?  If not, what are the options of adding a task that duration depends on duration of others? "
1181,Working with a pool/group of resources,"How can I effectively work with a pool of team member (nor the usual resource pool share file in project)?   Let me rephrase.  My resources are spread into pools/groups, that share the same skills and are capable of handling one another's work. Lets say:   Analysis pool has Mary and John Developers pool has Alfred, Tony and Ana.    In project, I'm using the pool name has the resource, instead of the actual persons, which I then define the available units to 200% or 300% (2 or 3 resources depending on the pool) and do my planning.  Each week, the tasks are then revisited, setting the ones that are completed, and defining the actual resources for the two weeks ahead, in order to have a buffer if the work is done faster.  In my case, this is quite nice, because in the long term planning, I actually define that I'll have the availability of two resources, instead of saying Mary and John. If the team grows or shrinks I seek that impact quite fast, otherwise I would have to reassign the work for each resource.  This kinda works, but I don't believe that is the best way, or at least, in my point of view. I don't have full management of working time (setting individual holidays and working hours). Instead I've to do manual calculations to set the units within a range of dates.  Is there a more efficient way to do this in Project 2007? "
1182,Gantt chart bar style changes on its own,"In MS project, when I updated the ""actual finish"" dates of some tasks, the formatting of Gantt chart bars on some of the following/dependent tasks automatically changed to be thicker/taller than they were. Why did this happen / what do the thicker/taller bars represent? Can I reset the formatting to the original?  "
1183,What if you do not believe in the project benefits?,"I've recently been assigned to a project as the PM and I'm fairly sure that a senior executive in the company has heard some fancy marketing spill at a conference and now wants this product at the company.  As far as I can see, it is an expensive and specialised application to coordinate much more complicated infrastructure than what we have and there is no use case for this product at this company.   I've tried explaining this but there is a lack of technical knowledge and the managers have expectations of all these proposed benefits, all of which are hypothetical and frankly unrealistic.  What is my responsibility here? Do I just accept that even through I disagree with the project benefits, I've been given this task to purchase and integrate this application so that should be my goal?  How do I protect myself when the application inevitably does not do everything that management expect it to do? Morally, should I step down as the PM for this project? "
1184,Transitioning into an Agile Project,"We will be working on an exciting new project that slightly blurs the line of PM and Consultancy. This organization is eager to introduce agile for supporting their existing applications, but they have not found the appropriate agile processes to support them.  The first stage of this project involving us to wear a hat of a consultant who will advise the senior management the appropriate agile processes, and later on be the actual PM in the project.   We have different agile background, some of us have some involvement in Scrum, and some of us have involvement in XP. We all agree - and you guys are open to debate on this, that at the heart of introducing agile is a notion that : ""Every organization has its own specific processes that become the bottleneck in their software development group. We take note that the bottle neck can also exist outside the software development group, but in the client instead""  We decided that the first thing that we should do is to identify these bottlenecks, and put in place the appropriate agile processes, educate everyone on our plan, get their agreement, and kick off the project.   In the first phase, our approach is to conduct focus groups, or one-to-one interviews between managers, software developers to know what the bottlenecks are. Have anyone do similar exercise before? Does anyone have any good techniques to spot these bottlenecks? "
1185,How to create an organised association that is project oriented?,"A group of youngsters (age average of 20 years) would like to establish an organisation that makes projects into reality. The question would be: What kind of structure would be the best to manage this organisation of about 32 people with different talents and specialties varying from Tech to Management?  I'd like examples of professional organizations that are project oriented and handles a lot of projects at the same time. I'd like our organization to be able to adapt to changes in the social scene in addition to changes in our economic state. I would also like to know a way to get us heavy sponsors?  I'd like to know everything there is to build a project team and how to maintain it including the tasks of every member of the team, etc. "

1187,Setting up two predecessors to the same task in MS Project,"Let's suppose there are two tasks (A and B) among others. I'd like to restrict B in such a way that:   It starts 5 natural days after A starts  It finishes 5 laborable days after A has finished   Assuming A has already its own predecessor, is there a way to set up B so that it respects both restrictions at the same time?  I could set up each restriction separately using A as predecessor of B, but not both at the same time. Is there a way? Thank you!  EDIT: More info about the problem   My goal is to be able to change the duration of A, and have the duration of B change automatically to honor the restrictions I described above. The actual task is: I'm installing a pipe in a trench which is already dug. A is the task of pouring the concrete. Then we have to wait 5 calendar days to start installing the pipe (task B), but even then, more concrete will still be being poured ahead on the trench. Then we have to wait other 5 workable days to be able to finish the pipe installation.  "
1188,"How can we manage multiple projects, as one small scrum team?","I know Agile came about as a group of 'adaptive software development' methods, where Scrum is one of them.  Some background: We are an innovative web agency, which implies design and development. We have multiple projects running and we use JIRA to log hours and create issues. JIRA also have a Agile method where you can have your scrumboard online instead of offline.  We want to start using Scrum for our project management or at least, use elements of Scrum. I'm aware of the difficulties and the principles Scrum has in order to make a Scrum project a success. Yet, I think it's possible to run multiple projects at the same time, using some elements of Scrum with minimal resources. We have a very small team, 3 developers (1 front-end/2 backend) and 1 Interaction Designer.  Our problem basically is that we have to manage multiple projects but we have a small team, so little capacity (velocity). So my one million dollar question is: How can we manage multiple projects, as we design, develop AND test our products as one single Scrum team?  As for one project it is already difficult enough. Can you design, develop and test everything in 1 or 2 week sprint? And how do you prevent the fact that other projects/clients won't be waiting for a month... "
1189,What are some ways you are getting your business engaged with your Agile team?,"I continue to see Agile adoptions that focus on the R&amp;D or Engineering team. There seems to be this acceptance that the core of Agile rests there. I'm absolutely not convinced. I think that if the business doesn't fully embrace the Agile transformation, it is doomed for failure. What ways are you engaging your business? Or do you think this is not necessary for applying Agile practices? "
1190,Emotional Intelligence vs Conflict Resolution,"I'm new to this stack section. I have 2 questions which might be too broad, which in case it can be modified by any of you.

Please inform me if this question goes against the stack rules so that I can either modify it or remove it accordingly.  Thank you. "
1191,Should I remove distraction time from developers' capacity time while giving time estimation?,"I am about to give new estimations of a project delivery time, estimating iterations etc..  Besides development, developers spend much time on distractions. By distractions I mean everything(tea, coffee, chats,) not directly related to development and code writing. In this case, developers spend no more than 6 hour on code writing instead of 8.  While giving estimations on task completion, developers always give daily estimation, not hourly.   This fact allows them to lengthen the task completion time. I know that a task will take 12 working hours to complete, but in fact it has taken 2 working (16 hours) days.  In this case  1.Should I take hourly estimation in order to be more precise  2.In my project management software, should I write a developer's daily capacity time-6 or 7 hour instead of 8?   I know that distractions are necessary and very vital and I do not argue their existence. The main question is 'Is is right to extract this time while making estimations?' "
1192,How to deal with constantly (~daily) changing requirements?,"I see a number of similar links, but none seem to have a solution, mostly ""they shouldn't be doing that""'s. I agree, but please, read on:  Scenario: 800K pages of documents, narrative(e.g. emails)/bank statements/legal (e.g. options agreements). We are a small team, with only 2 investigators (1 of whom is primarily responsible for production), 1 financial person, and 1 legal person (along with some admin assistants and outside specialists). We have multiple ongoing projects (think different cases in different courts in different countries).   The thing is, the 800K pages of docs have not been fully reviewed (at this point, maybe 50%). So, we decide on work product (Monday; person 1 will do x by Friday) but by Tuesday afternoon, we've inevitably uncovered some additional documentation.   Too often, this documentation changes the whole story, changes the angle we need to come at it, changes the relationships. By Tuesday afternoon, the various legal teams (who do little investigating) request various work products in relation to this new find. My investigator/work product champion takes off on it, with a full heart, and (you guessed it) before it's done (all too often) we have even more information that changes things or causes a redirect. It's insanity.   We're processing, at times, 2-3K pages/day. So you can see how even a few bombshells in there cause havok like no tomorrow, and yet they are actually even less than 1% of total documents.   How are we supposed to handle this? Force through a week of finishing what we started? What if it's useless or wrong? Wait to produce until the investigation is done? More often than not, it's following one particular thread that itself leads to new revelations, AND we have statutes of limitations on filing this and that. Hire more staff? It would take months to have them gain enough traction to be useful, and guess who'd have to train them?   We tried kanban - the boards would get full of nonsense within a week or two. Having a high priority ""fast lane"" was a good idea.. until it wasn't. A burndown chart looks like a plateau, after you adjust for added tasks and how many remain unfinished... client (and product owner, really) wants someone to manage this crazy (yours truly), but doesn't really want to change their habits (which are mostly paper-based.. did I mention we're printing and manually reviewing all of these documents??)  Any and all advice and perspectives on this (especially with models or examples or actual ""do this"" suggestions) are so, so appreciated.   TL;DR: Management wants more control, more work product, more value per $.   Staff want to avoid the constant re-work, have an idea of what the overall strategy is, see their work-product actually getting shipped  I want to show that the above two are not mutually exclusive, and that there is a way for these needs to interface nicely, without a huge brake put on the workflow, wasted meetings, etc. I can see that these three wants are reasonable and rational, but there's a serious grind between them right now..

1195,Why does the burndown chart include weekends and nights?,"Currently my team's burndown charts includes weekends and nights, I feel like this harms the velocity by misrepresenting it, however, I cannot explain this very well.  This is what is going on in my head...  In my team Velocity = Number of Story Points Completed / Sprint and Sprint = 2 Weeks    So as an example, in the above image, the commit is 50 story points, while the team was only able to deliver 50 - 10 = 40 story points this sprint, so the team's velocity is 40 story points.  Removing Weekends    Currently the target burndown chart generate by JIRA (grey) at the start of the sprint includes the weekends, I feel like it should not include the weekends (blue). What are the benefits of including the weekends? What are the downsides of removing the weekends? Does including the weekends harm velocity?  Removing Nights    Because we track nights, everyday we go above the target line (grey) and it looks like we are under-delivering. What are the benefits of including the nights? What are the downsides of removing the nights? Does including the weekends harm nights?    What also came to me while writing this, is that during planning we say that each developer will do 8 hours of work per day, however, we track 24 hours of work per day. "
1196,PM for team of 30-50 people,"I was always wondering how people can manage 30-50 people projects. Working for software company, you can have 1-2 small projects, 7-8 people each. This can be managed using Agile.   Now what if the scope if so big that you really need so many people.  How do PMs approach that ?  Do they create project management team, PM - responsible for the whole project and project coordinators who are responsible for smaller deliverables ?  Or PM and technical team leads ? (Is this ok, according to PMO strategy)  I don't believe it's possible to manage 30-50 people directly. One-to-one meetings will fill all your time.  Could you please describe your experience ? "
1197,Quality and Risk,"Trying to understand the entailment between Quality and Risk, can we state that   ""Non Conformance to Quality Leads to Materialization of Risk (Known/Unknown)""?   If this statement is true, how concrete is it? "
1198,How to handle somebody who does not take into account what is said to him?,"I'm facing a problem that is quite new for me, and want to discuss it. I have in my team a developer who doesn't take into account the directives that are given to him. He doesn't follow priorities that are given to him and sometime even specifications.  The person is competent in coding, motivated and well intentioned, so I'm pretty sure that we can come up with a way to work that work.  Let me give a few examples to have a better understanding of the situation.  We had a project that was almost ready to be published. However, a bug has to be fixed in a functionality, and another in the function that register customer account. We had another developer on the bug in the functionality, so I told him that fixing the one in account creation was absolutely critical, and he should spend his time on that. I tried to be as clear as possible: ""If we cannot register a new customer, we cannot sell our product, so functionalities, with or without bugs, are useless. This is the #1 priority"". Obviously, I find out that he goes helping the other developer. He did good work, but that work was not the priority and was not what he was assigned to.  On another project, we gave him technical specifications about a development he has to do. He comes up with something that works, but doesn't fulfill the specifications. We said to him to refactor his work to match the specification. This was better but still didn't match them. The specification was more complicated than what was needed to make his work, so he decided to make it more simpler. Which is good, except the fact that I'm responsible for that, so he should discuss with me when he takes decisions like that, and that we know that a future improvement of the software will need that specification (which he would have known if he had talked to me).  I'm pretty sure that the problem comes up not from the guy, but from the interaction between him and the way the management is done in the company.  So basically, how to get the situation to improve and make everybody walk in the same direction? What do you think we did wrong when managing here? "
1199,How do I frame epics?,"I'm working on an application to help create a grocery list based on the meals (and their ingredients and quantity) that the user provides. So far, the epics that I've come up with are:  1.) Research (units of measure, popular food items and categories, etc.)  2.) Login  3.) Scenarios (have food and possible recipe, need meals etc.)  4.) My Fridge (feature that allows user to store what they already have in the fridge)  5.) Units of measure (locale detection? how do we allow the user to switch between imperial and metric systems)  6.) Grocery list (how to display, best way to display, email/sms grocery list to self, email/sms to others, etc.)  7.) Food (need to find the most common way each food is measured, display est calories, etc.)  I'm creating epics off major components of the application. Is this the right way to frame them? "
1200,Communicating non-viability of project,"I'm a consultant usually brought in by companies doing project management on big projects, setting up operations etc. The last few years I have been dealing mainly with digital and creative agencies.  This sector historically has a low level of expertise within software development. The lifespan of agency projects, once released, are often measured in months rather than years, since most projects are in some way marketing related. As such they are not accustomed to the complexity or scope of ""real"" software development.  My problem is as follows: When presented with a new project, which I can rather quickly dismiss as unfeasible (we're talking extremely unrealistic projects), I have trouble communicating why it cannot be done. I argue the technical complexity and the requirements versus the time and price scope. I am however not able to make my points persuasive.   Essentially my recommendations get ignored, and the client looks around until they've found a vendor or individual who says ""yes it can be done"". Both times, the projects crashed and burned. Reason being they were so amazingly unrealistic, that even inexperienced technical project managers would dismiss them right away.  What kind of approach or what kind of arguments would you use when presented with something unrealistic, yet highly desired by major stakeholders? Maybe any literature to read on the subject? "
1201,Items which feed critical path activities,"I'm working on documenting a situation where an activity (call it 'a') which is not itself on the project critical path has a direct impact on an activity (call it 'b') which is on the project critical path. That is, any delay in 'a' results in a delay in 'b' or failure to complete 'a' results in the failure to complete 'b'. What is the most correct way to describe activity 'a'? Is it a secondary critical path or something along those lines?  Thanks for any thoughts! "
1202,Keep User Assignment for Tasks in Done Columns?,"I do understand that the concept of the Work In Progress (WIP) of a column counts for both, the ""in progress"" and the ""done""-subcolumn to keep the flow stable and force the team to identify and solve bottlenecks.  We have an interdisciplinary team where most people can work in most of the available columns. We have an overall WIP for the board and WIP-Limits for each column.  I got a question which I could not find an answer for anywhere: Do you keep people assigned to a task when it enters the done column? If you do so, the columns WIP-Limits match the overall WIP. Sounds logical.  On the other hand, if people stay assigned to a done task, they cannot be assigned to another column where they could potentially help while actually having time to do so. If I unassign them from a done task and assign them to another tasks while respecting the overall limit of the board, then we would have other people being idle, because less people would fill up the overall WIP-Limit than are actually available.  How do you do it? "
1203,Using Trello to 'iterate' / give feedback on tasks that are marked as staged or done,We are using Trello for project management of a dev project. Here is how we are working currently:  Developer takes a card assigned to them from the Todo pile and moves it to Doing then the  Developer works on card and moves it to Done.  Then the task / module / card has to be tested for functionality / bugs etc so what often happens is that the cards get moved back to Doing as more info is added into the comments section of the card about something not working / looking right.   Is this the best way to iterate / give feedback on cards? Or is there a better / more accepted or standardized workflow? Would you have a staged or for testing column in between Doing and Done? 
1204,Cost Estimates for agile projects,"For Fixed Bid projects , the approach in our company is :   The estimation is done for every user story in story points, and team has to convert those story points into hours. Once we find out the hours estimate, then we can arrive at the cost of the project. Hence, one approach is to run a sample sprint of one week, selecting a few features from the product backlog. If the team completes 50 story points in 250 hours, then each story point costs 250/50 = 5 hours. So if we estimate, overall, 1,000 story points, then the estimate of hours will be 5 x 1,000 = 5,000 hours. The team has to decide on the DoD (definition of done) before coming to this estimation. If we're billing $X for each man-hour, then the cost will be 5,000 x $X.   What do you think about this?   Apart from this, other cost model is TnM(Resource based cost) which should be generally used but not always accepted by client.   Is there any other cost Model used by your company. Please guide? "
1205,Tips and steps need to follow to setup successful continuous integration environment,I have been a scrum master of one single project of a co-located scrum team for last one year. Our program has been expanding rapidly and we are forming multiple scrum teams. The plan is to have one more local scrum team and also one distributed scrum team across a different time zone. So the questions are:   How do I setup continuous integration in a multi-team distributed environment without running into issues of broken builds? How do I plan for the frequently shippable increment Sprint on Sprint basis of all three projects combined? Any other things I need to watch for or take care of for setting up such an environment? My idea is to make it first time right from process standpoint (at least most of the process).  
1206,How to identify optimum story points for user stories,"I would like to discuss a scenario in the sprint planning. Suppose the total velocity of the sprint is 30 as per the previous sprints. The objective of the product owner is to plan 3 stories with 10 story points each in current sprint. During the sprint planning, the development team saying that they want 30 days to complete one story. As a product owner, how should I convince the developers? Identifying the story points is not a one sided opinion. Right ?  "
1207,How big should be each story for a person in 3 week sprint?,"We know that long term planning(Release planning) should be in story points.  But for sprint planning, it should be commitment based.  Breaking the product backlog item / user story into tasks and estimating the tasks, team asking themselves if they can commit to delivering the product backlog item, and then repeating until they are full?  For a three week sprint, how big should be each story for a person?  Also,I have seen that some teams do away with this task based planning and have stories that are just 2 day long?   Should I standardize this for my team?  So before a sprint, I break my stories to such short stories that they fit this standard.  Please, let me know your viewpoints about this. And what is the general practice? "
1208,Project manager roles and planning,"I have a very general idea of what a project manager does - taking each project group's work and basically synthesizing it in the most optimal, cost efficient way.  However, for this internship position, I was tasked to give a rough outline of being the project manager for a certain website. It had to include deadlines, milestones, etc. But I can't seem to figure out what these ""deadlines"" should include.. Simplistically, don't I simply give a template to the web developers and expect the template back? Or are there more factors coming into play?  Thanks for helping!  If you can, can I please see an example ""outline"" for a website? For instance,  Week 1: General body meeting, discuss template  Week 2: Discuss template with partners, stakeholders, etc.. I honestly have no idea what to write. "
1209,Avoiding vendor lock-in with few vendors available,"My company is venturing into a niche area of the telecom business. The challenge we are facing is there are very few vendors of some critical software we need and in turn there are very few customers to buy the software. It's just a small market for this particular product.  Vendor lock-in is a huge concern but seems inevitable.  We have ruled out developing the software ourselves as leadership feels that may be expanding our mission too much at once. The vendors will also not let us buy the the source code (i.e. the intellectual property), so if we ever do decide to change vendors we will have little that can be reused other than our data.  Does anyone have experience or pro-tips on working with a vendor pool of 1-2 providers where one cannot easily (matter of years) move from one vendor to another? How can we avoid lock-in? My request for proposal (RFP) experience so far has never really been limited by vendor selection and the niche market dynamics is uncharted territory. "
1210,Alternative name for Developer Acceptance Testing,"In our process our developers run Unit Tests and Integration Tests before they check in their code for it to be built and deployed to UAT where the testers and product owners can perform their test fixtures and acceptance tests.  Once the unit tests and integration tests have successfully completed, the developer where possible will demonstrate to the tester the working functionality to ensure that the acceptance criteria is satisfied before checking the code in. This test is performed on the development environments by the developer. This begs the question      How do we refer to a non automated test run on the development environment?   I like the sound of Development acceptance testing  Other suggestions could be Pre Check in Review or perhaps Development Sanity Checking  Is there a more standard moniker for this activity doing the rounds in the agile community that I haven't heard of as yet? "
1211,How to use Scrum in DSDM?,"In my current company, Dynamic Systems Development Method (DSDM) is the Agile framework chosen for delivery. Scrum is followed as the Agile process within DSDM.  Can we really use Scrum as an agile methodology in DSDM? If so, how to mitigate these conflicting processes between Scrum and DSDM?  I have found conflicting roles / processes / functionalities between Scrum and DSDM, such as:   We have Business roles to supplement the product owner in Scrum and no dedicated product owner in the team. We have teams of less than 3 for individual projects but conflicts the Scrum team size minimum requirement. Product backlogs are primarily prioritized based on MoSCoW and not rank ordered numerically. Timeboxing is used instead of Iteration.  "
1212,Why can't QA's share expertise and suggest new ways of working,"I work as part of an eight-member agile team. When I joined the company I saw lots of problems in the team. I decided to share my past experience to help the team but the team saw me as a small person, challenging them.  My question is, if agile is about the team and the team takes responsibility for the failure of the project or sprint then why can't the QA suggest new ways of working?    Do you think it's unfair to hold the QA accountable when they are treated as a small person?      I did fair bit of research before suggesting new ideas. I also removed any ownership claim and did not involve senior management team  but still the team saw me as a threat. It's definitely to do with my role as a QA.   Senior management recently sent another guy to help add new processes to the team and the team actually listens to him. He's doing everything the way I was doing but senior management team likes him so the team can't say or do anything to him.   He said it's not QA's responsibility to add processes or suggest anything that's why the team don't like it. They see you as a challenge.   "
1213,Is focusing on one project beneficial even when project priorities can't be quantified?,"Small internal IT department that assists all of a company's departments.  Each department has projects that each are 'priority 1' - the departments and executive team are unwilling to strictly prioritize projects.  Because of this, the argument was made that IT should not focus on one project, since multiple projects must be highest priority and therefore must be done simultaneously.  This strikes me as flawed reasoning, but I was unable to articulate exactly how/why.  Am I wrong - is it actually a bad idea for IT to work as a team instead of multiple individual developers on multiple projects?  Or is it still better for IT to work as a team and swarm one project at a time? If so - why? "
1214,How to plan for fixed bid during contract time?,"During Contract time, we are given requirement details and we dont have stories.  If we have to go for fixed bid contract, do we create stories at time?  I doubt - as no one has time at contract stage to create stories and decide on story points?  So, how do you approach for this?  Do you create epics and give story point to it and plan based on that? But I believe epics can not be broken into stories that are equivalent size. StackLink  or   Do you just estimate development effort in a waterfall way? And build a cost around it and sign contract? In the plan you mention Agile plan will be given after stories are created and velocity known. But i dont think this can really work out always?  StackLink  or  Is there some other way? "
1215,How can I integrate information from a waterfall customer into an agile project?,"We're currently doing an agile project where the customer is less agile than what we actually hoped for (he stays with waterfall). Also, while an official requirements specification exists, it is unfortunately not updated by the client (timing problems, whatever), so, our current process to get information we need looks like this:   to get the requirements right we collect questions to the ""epics"" we identified in a Wiki (Confluence) for each epic, we export these questions to a Word file and send them to the customer the customer comments on these questions and sends them back we copy-over the comments from the Word file back into the Wiki and further comment on them or close the questions, eventually we send updated epic exports back to the client   The reason why we try to keep these information in the Wiki is because we would like to have one central, searchable place where all the project requirements are clarified and described in detail (no Word document hell). Furthermore, we currently write our system specification in the same Wiki as well, which gives us the ability to reference customer answers / requirements to the functional requirements we define and much more.  Obviously though there is at least one problem with this approach: The hand-copying of answers and the exporting of question catalogues over and over again. This, paired with the problem that some kind of ""external"" agreed document must always exist to reference later on in case stuff goes wrong, is a major headache for us.  I know people used Action Item lists for these kind of things in the past, but this does not at all fit our information finding expectations. On the other hand, a Wiki, by its nature being able to be edited at any time, surely will also not match the ""agreed document"" requirement.  So, what are some valid techniques to do these things better (proper tool support even?!) or have you already ran away after you read the first paragraph of this question? "
1216,Are processes and procedures only for enterprises?,"I've had the opportunity to work at quite a few start-ups. One thing I've found to be common in them is adhoc way of doing things and ignorance towards processes, best practices and known project management techniques. When I suggest changes to the employers they come up with the answer that all these processes look good in books and reality is different OR they are only relevant in Google, Microsoft and Yahoo like companies.  For example in the middle of the sprint (in Scrum) a product owner would come and say. Hey I've changed my mind about so and so feature so lets do the changes. Don't tell me about man hours, estimates and sprints. Just finish this tonight.  It seems start-ups are exempted from following the standards and best way for them is to just go with the flow and make decisions based on gut feelings. Is that true? What is the justification? "
1217,Which development method to choose - Test-Driven or Behaviour Driven Development,"In my current company, we follow DSDM.  But the maturity of the process is in progress and we are adapting various methods to be Agile.  Current Process:  Currently epics and user stories elaboration happen throughout the sprint and they are not detailed enough at the start of the sprint and stories get updated even after initial code development is completed.  With the above practise, which development approach will help the team?  Can we combine both methods for development? BDD to ensure we gather enough requirements for the story and write the user acceptance test in the required format. Use TDD to write test first and code.  Also considering the cost of delays in delivering user stories, which is the recommended approach to be Agile and deliver more? "
1218,Work agile with a very small team,"I'm working on a software development project on a team with only two persons and it's not an option to consider hiring more people.  This appears to be a case where one has to respond to change over following a plan because the team is small in comparison to the ideal 5-6 people.  Do you happen to know successful cases in such conditions? If so, how was the team organized and how were they able to deliver the project with success? "
1219,What should be the role of Project Scientist in the team?,"I have joined one research institute as Project Scientist, but there is no clarification of the job profile here.  What should be the role of Project Scientist in the team? As we work on projects which are client based and also we do research for paper publications in journals, but from a project management perspective what is the exact role? AS a human recourse manager, what is the key responsibility of such a post in the organization? what value it adds to the project by adding such a person to the project?  Also I want to know actually what should be the qualities for the team member to satisfy such a role?  Thannks a lot in advance.... "
1220,How to start a charity project making use of college students as cram school teachers for orphans in lower levels of education?,"I want to start a charity project that makes use of the human capital we have here in Morocco. The targeted population of the project is orphans of the same city and i'm having thoughts about making it national in three to 4 years time. The project Idea is to help orphans get proper education and support from the students who are evidently teacher material ! It's like a cram school that goes to orphanages to help the orphans, not the orphans going to cram school. And of course, it's a charity . So they won't pay for it.  I want to know how to study the reliability of the project in addition to its possibility of being applied in reality?  What are some methods to judge the viability of a project prior to pitching to stakeholders? "
1221,"In MSP, what are the differences between ""Status Date"" and ""Current Date""?","I googled up a bit about this but could not find a real answer, so here I am!  In Microsoft Project, you have two things:   The Current Date (Can be find in Project>Project Information)  The Status Date (Can be changed directly in the Project tab)   To me Status date should be used to report from a certain date, and the Current date should be used to tell MSP that ""today"" is a particular day. However, I could not find the list of differences between the use of the 2 dates.   What are the main differences between the 2 of them? How does that each impact the advancement of a task? (For example Progress lines...)   Thanks! "
1222,PMP/PMI and other similar classes,"I am poor, very poor, so poor that I don't have money to take a PMP class. So I decided to teach myself about it.  However, I find myself having a lot of knowledge gaps that a PM may have (i.e mindset, being energetic to kick off becoming one, being confused if I am given a project to start with as I might not know where to begin, lacking of skills in using excel templates or available software to monitor tasks e.g redmind, jira etc). Without taking a PMP class formally and getting qualified, how can I become a PM ? could you provide some steps for me to crawl up to being a manager :-D ? "
1223,How to handle user stories that cannot be split and do not fit even a 30 days long sprint?," Given a small team (3 people or so) and a technically challenging area (e.g. middleware, embedded software etc.), and  Assuming that a user story is a smallest thing that has value for the end user,   how do you go about handling stories that take more than one month to reach the DONE-DONE state? Of course one could always split them into several so called ""technical stories"", but they are, with the exception of refactoring spikes, a big no-no in Agile, aren't they? "
1224,Is there any of Special way of showing Tentative Tasks in a Gantt graph using Project Libre?,"I'm documenting a Software Web Application Project Plan. The customers have sent us:  1) snapshots of the various Web pages, and  2) Change Request Snapshots of some existing Web pages that we already developed.  Also, they send us software functional requirements through various emails. In other words, the software functional reqs are scattered here and there in various emails.  I started writing a Software Web Application Project Plan for the Webpages that so far contains various tasks that pertain to changes in aesthetics, and content of the webpages.  I created a Gantt graph using Project Libre. I listed out the various Tasks, Subtasks, work packages, etc., but is there any of showing Tentative Tasks? In other words, is there a way to ensure that other people who review the Gantt graph know that it is a tentative task?  The reason I'm asking is that the Customer is constantly changing requirements which is quite common in software projects. "
1225,When do you integrate Acceptance Testing into a scrum process?,"I want to know exactly when I can integrate acceptance testing into a scrum process? During the sprint cycle or at the end of the sprint cycle?   I know that acceptance testing is when we test the software against the user requirements, but i want to know exactly when acceptance tests should be done in the scrum process. "
1226,Important Information for a Developer to Know About Project Management,"As a developer as part of a team comprising of a variety of roles e.g. project manager technical lead, business analyst, quality assurance etc, what are the most important things for a developer to be aware of about project management? How deep an understanding is appropriate for a developer? "
1227,How can I calculate earned value in MS Project with variable costs?,"I'm using MS Project to manage training projects as a vendor. We are currently calculating earned value based on the hours budget for deliverables. However, we often have multiple people on the project at different billable rates, and also sell some deliverables in units instead of hours - training deliveries are a good example.  I'm looking for a simple way to more accurately calculate the earned value based on dollars instead of hours; any ideas?   Is there a column I could include with costs? How would that correspond to Work, and what % Complete field would I use? If I apply a billable rate to Resources am I creating a lot of work for myself just managing the software? What else haven't I thought of yet?  Thanks! "
1228,how to execute sprint effectively?,"How to execute sprint effectively?   If my story is developed , tested i.e. unit + acceptance + regression, all the bugs are resolved i.e. even low bugs then only developer take on another story? Or we can submit in UAT with open low bugs? When is the best time to write automated test cases - I understand that unit testing automated test cases is written in parallel but when should functional or regression test cases be written. I am asking this question so that I hire my team resources accordingly. I believe when system will be somewhat ready after 2-3 releases then i will hire automated testers. Is there a practice of creating Technical Stories against Business Stories?  "
1229,Is a Developer Getting Involved in Project Management a Good Idea?,"As a developer working on a team with a project manager, is it valuable for the team and/or the project manager to have team members who are aware of project management and for them to share their opinions?  How does this effect the relationships between team members? "
1230,Why not use costs instead of story points for estimation?,"I propose the following scheme for estimating user stories in a scrum process:  A good programmer might cost 80000[tex]/52 weeks/40 hours per week = 40[tex]. So the maximum size of a story for a two week sprint should be 3200$ . So instead of using story points to estimate stories/tickets, one could use the following schema to estimate tickets from lowest to highest complexity  50[tex], 200[tex], 800[tex], 3200$   One could also add that bugs cannot be estimated, so we might give them always a cost in the middle of the scheme of 400$.  What would be the disadvantage of using such a scheme for estimating tickets? Has anyone tried estimating tickets based on costs within scrum? "
1231,How to estimate employee resources?,"We are starting our new project in Scrum/agile method. The client asked us to provide the estimations on their high level requirements. We will be able to form the team during Sprint 0 which we will form in few weeks from now. I understand that the team will provide estimations (T shirt size/story points) based on that we will arrive at the end date. But in the context we are working now, the team will be added later. So, i have broadly three questions    How will I come up with the dates based on scope without having the team now? (I dont have historic data also)  How do I determine scientifically the number of resources needed to finish the release ? How different are the estimates and estimation for an Agile project done vs Waterfall?  "
1232,Who can add more cards to the Kanban Backlog,"If a project is already started and the team is using a Kanban Board, who can add more cards to the Backlog? Are there some specific rules? Is it the manager, any of the team members, or are such decision taken after a meeting? "
1233,"Given a ""frozen"" iteration plan, what happens if the plan's stories require more work than expected","I am not sure how to phrase this but I'd like to ask how Agile handles this.  My understanding is that in Agile, you freeze the stories that are in the current sprint.  What happens when a developer starts working on a story and realizes it's bigger than expected?  At that point, do you plan ahead by removing something else from the plan?  conversely, if they start working and get it done much faster than expected, can you fit something else in?  Or do you  just complete the sprint achieving less than you could have.  Specific to my situation, we have 6 week iterations, and the work is estimated upfront to fit into the iteration plan - but sometimes developers realize later that it will take more or less time, and then the iteration plan has to change.  It seems that this would be incredibly common even if developers are choosing their stories and estimating/committing to them. "
1234,Feedback process for individuals in scrum team,"I work as Scrum Master in a team which has developers and QAs. In the organization I work for we have a review cycle every six months. Directors do the evaluation of the Scrum team based on agile principals and team output and managers do the evaluation of individuals. But we do not have a formal feedback process from the Scrum team to managers for individual team member.  For example, what if a team member needs his\her working style changed and it's not happening even after multiple discussions? The reason why I think a formal process is necessary because it is my feeling that people do not think they belong to the Scrum team since in appraisals\reviews, the Scrum team is not involved and all of it is still in the hands of management.  I was wondering if you had dealt with something of the sort. What was your solution?  EDIT  Little bit more information: we have mix goals - part of goals are team based which directors look at based on team's output and part of them are individual goals managers set based on their understanding of individual and expectations. There is no discussion between scrum team and managers while setting the individual goals. They can be about soft or hard skills. But the work is done in scrum team and scrum team is not aware of individual objectives. But they are evaluated at the end of six months nevertheless. If they were only team based goals I wouldn't worry. But if individual goals conflict with team goals, then employees would\do give preference to individual goals (or whatever manager says) because at the end of it all, it's their opinion that decides appraisals at least when it comes to individual goals.  About the example, I gave was a general example. It can be good thing as well (someone going out of the way). Problem I see is that there is no way to recognize that. All these needs a process to funnel into. I have tried in the past to send feedback to manager since manager decides individual goals' evaluation but it was met with passing consideration if any. All this complexity leads me to believe that there has to be feedback from scrum team to management.The 360 degree feedback suggestions seem okay to me. I don't want to be elevated to manager at all but I do not know how to protect the team if scrum team feedback is not part of the process of evaluation. Would it be ideal to have 360 degree feedback (do that in accordance with agile) or is it just somehow making agile work in mixture of traditional management with agile? Or would it ideal to have only team based goals or should scrum team have discussions with managers while deciding goals, individual or otherwise? "
1235,MS Project: Make task delays visible,I want to show the delays that are caused by moving the end of a task. Let's say I have a task that is planned like that:  Task 1 - Start: 26.10.2015 End: 20.11.2015  Now the following changes occur:  On 27.10.2015 the end-date will be moved to 22.11.2015. And then another time on the 28.10.2015 the end-date will be moved to 26.11.2015.  I want to use a column in project that tells: The original end-date moved by 6 days and it changed two times.   Is that possible? What columns do I have to use for tha? 
1236,PMP question bank,I am looking for a way to practice for PMP. A question bank for PMP would be nice. There are lots of sample questions in web. But I do not know which one to select. What can be the criteria to select? Or do you have any recommendations? 
1237,"Project cancelled, still client wants to use parts of it?","After four prototypes on a mailshot design, the client is now telling me that the project is going to be cancelled.  Because a lot of work was involved, I submitted an updated ""cost estimate"" (in this case the project was being made in a ""project-value"" kind of cost estimate).  Anyway, now the client is asking for parts of the project (very small bits), telling me that they are paying parts of the project so they're ""entitled"" to have some parts, and I am in the middle of an argument trying to explain that the new cost estimate is related to the work done and not the deliverables, I thought a canceled project means no deliverables, right?  So, what should I do?  A. tell them to pay for my work and nothing more (no deliverable handed)  B. send them those bits, very insignificant but still this goes against my point (my concern is that in their minds they feel they can use my work and unfortunately my contract isn't very specific for those cases because honestly in 15 years this is the first time this happens!) If I take this option, I will definitely tell them that they are forbidden to use any other material.  C. ? "
1238,"What can I do when I can't adjust scope, resources, or schedule and a team member wants a raise?","After almost 20y programming and 5y managing I have arrived at a state to be so confused with the basics that I need help from outside!  At the project management we have 3 pillars:    Scope: features and functionality Resources: costs and budget Schedule: time   And those 3 results the product with a kind of the quality.  Most of the programmers are employed. They have a fixed time based costs. But they have hidden costs too: example producing bugs.  Managers or product owners usually have a yearly budget or a budget for feature set. Usually 2 they have at fixed from 3.  That resulting the 3rd it is adjustable somewhat or the 4th: quality Example 1 year budget for development of X feature is Y sum. At PM level is the similar: for the next Sprint in 3 week we need to do 10 backlogs, and I know the team costs ( salary)  What if somebody is asking a salary increase? if I keep him, I have higher costs. Hence probably my budget will blow up.  I can try to replace him or raise the budget.  What if  I can't keep him, but can't lose him, because hard to replace him (maybe takes to much time or even higher salary requests are), and the feature set need to met and the quality can't be lowered? "
1239,How do you keep documentation on long-term project?,"I'm working on optimizing the process of documentation on the projects in IT company.  The issue is that right now the company has documentation when the project is started but then they don't continue to add details about the new functions which they add.  Also, I think there should be a difference between documentation for managers and developers.   What tools do you use for that?  What best practices have you seen? "
1240,Who should see the Vision and Scope document?,"We're about to meet some influential people on my project's field (at least they're influential in my country), data mining, mainly looking for some advice and, why not, a possible alliance in a mid term.  I'm finishing the Vision and Scope document.  My question is, who should see this document? Should it be shown to demonstrate that we have something concrete and well planned and that it's not a bare idea? Or is it something that must be handled inside the organization only?  If you ask what covers mine:   Problem Description Background Risks Assumptions Solution proposed People involved Potential users Features   That sort of things. "
1241,How can we fix Sprint Planning meetings that are unproductive?,"Currently, we have split ""Sprint Planning Meeting"" into two parts:   SPM1 - This we do at the first day of the sprint. Product owner discusses the stories that have come into the current sprint from Backlog. All stories are already discussed in Backlog so we don't have much here. Mostly we discuss if something was pending or not clear in backlog. Post this meeting, PO makes sure that team has 100% clarity about the stories. SPM2 - This is a purely technical discussion. We don't include PO here. We break stories into the testable task so that team member gets broad overview what needs to be executed, what is expected of each task, facilitate parallel development.    The problems we are facing:   SPM1 Problem - There are fewer things to discuss. The team is not convinced on exact agenda of the meeting, they say why don't we discuss complete thing in Backlog only. (We have two backlogs in a sprint). The rest dependencies they suggested can be discussed via email etc. SPM2 Problem - We struggle with creating tasks from stories. We don't have clear idea to what depth things should be discussed. Should discussion include which code layer i.e BL,DAL,UI, what code would be put OR just how different systems would connect with each other i.e. breaking of functionality and leaving rest to the developer?   Some additional context:   Team size: 5 developers, 1 tester, 1 Product Owner Sprint length: two weeks  Average production experience of developers/tester: 2 years   Are we doing something wrong here? Should we split ""Sprint Planning Meeting"" into two parts like this, is it standard scrum practice? How should we resolve these problems? "
1242,Where does documentation like business and software requirement spec docs fit in an agile project?,"We are implementing scrum in our company. The problem we faced is our traditional thinking, which always requires physical document.   Management is constantly asking for documents like Business Requirements Specification (BRS) and Software Requirements Specification(SRS).  When moving towards agile, is it ok writing user stories and their acceptance criteria as an alternative of (BRS and SRS) in a single document?  If that's the case, can you supply me with templates or examples? Is there something like an ISO standard related to Agile documentation?   We use TFS for project management. "
1243,Is it a possible to add a stakeholder to an impact map?,"My team and I were considering adding a stakeholder actor to the map, but we've got questions.  First, if we have it in the map, how can we fill the 4th field, i.e. how can we affect our stakeholder?  Second, impact maps are intended to be presented to a stakeholder, does it make sense to have the stakeholder in there?  Follow this link for more info on impact mapping (found in google) "
1244,What questions would you recommend to put into project estimation checklist?,"I would like to create common checklist for project estimation in my organization. The idea behind is to make sure that you have taken into account different aspects (ie. lack of knowledge of given technology, people leaves, 3rd dependencies, complex UI, etc.) in the estimates. I would like to find out if someone has been already verifying estimates against such help questions. If so, how detailed they are, what kind of types you are using? Do you find them useful?  "
1245,pivotal tracker chore: Should chores be estimated or not?,"To give a background, We are web automobile company having a new and used cars portal, something like autotrader usa  We have lots of technical debt pending i.e. moving our pages to new backend technology, updating the versions of various open source modules we have integrated, modularizing the javascript etc.  The problem is, should we give points to these or not?  Why team wants point for chores:   There is a lot of legacy code that team says should now be considered as a feature since the majority of the team members never worked at the time when this legacy code was put to production. They say velocity measures ""how fast team delivers"", why shouldn't we count things like exploring new technology like a unit testing framework or new UI framework like React, upgrading existing software to higher versions, moving to better technology in the team's velocity, isn't these things worthy enough in fast moving technical world? Many times PO suggest to take short cut approach rather than ideal technical approach either due to business pressure or to quickly see the results. If the experiment succeeds,the same thing needs to be done in a proper manner. This is technical debt, why shouldn't we count this in velocity? Automating release process- this does not impact customers life, so it should be chore ideally. But it saves team's time and headache. Why we shouldn't give points to it?   Why it shouldn't be given points:   I believe if the team is smart enough to pick right chore activities time to time, this would automatically start showing up in velocity in future sprints. For example, if they start using a unit testing framework (done as a chore with no points), in future, there would be fewer bugs and team would be able to deliver more. If a team has to deliver 300 points in next 3 months, and they ask PO for clearing technical debt in the first month, so the team would be delivering 0 points in the first month. But the team should pick stories that would clear all technical hurdles so that team now can deliver 300 points in next 2 months. This would motivate the team to pick the business aligned technical debts and not random stuff to decorate their resume.  "
1246,How best to conduct a Sprint Review when the Sprint had work for multiple clients?,I work for a digital agency as an agile project manager. We have recently adopted Scrum.   We are looking at aligning all of our project work for multiple clients into all encompassing 2 week Sprints rather than have a 2 week Sprint per project.  My question is how best can I manage the Sprint Review ceremony specifically demonstrating the work that we've completed to all of our clients in a single meeting? I don't want our clients to be hanging around waiting for us to finish with one client before moving on to the next.  Thoughts? 
1247,How to handle friction between the team and a new process,"Martin is the project manager for a small new product development project at his company. After some time, audits reveal that the quality of the finished product, if it continues along its current trend, will be poor. The people on his project team are skilled and intelligent individuals who have worked on projects like this many times in the past, but the new process they are required to follow, although much better than the previous process, seems to be getting in their way.  When I come across the same situation in my company where the team feels that a quality process is getting in their way, should I change the process? Or do I keep the process in place and resolve the matter another way? In what way? Why? "
1248,pivotal tracker chore: Should chores be picked regularly or one complete sprint should be dedicated to it? At what rate velocity should increase,"What is ideal scrum approach:   To fix bandwidth i.e. 10% of every sprint to clear off the technical debt? To dedicate one/two sprint every year to clear off these debts?   I believe both has its pros and cons like in  (1) we can measure things constantly i.e. if we are doing right things or are we off track? In case we are off track, next sprint we can try something else. While in (2) the continuity would lead to more work as complete team would be thinking in the same direction but with greater risk as it would be big code changes.  Suggestions? "
1249,How do we integrate marketing in our Scrum process?,"We are a small team that just created a website. We used Scrum and it worked very well for us. But now we have to shift our focus to marketing that website.   We would like to keep Scrum as our development method, but it does not seem to handle the requirements of marketing very well.  Problems are for example:   stories that have external dependencies, like waiting for a callback. Those tasks are very often not ""done"" at the end of a sprint. many stories have a strict deadline and are lost in the one dimensional backlog that is sorted by importance new opportunities (e.g. an interview is scheduled) come in on a daily basis. Having them in the system just as timeboxed ""handle interviews""-story seems very crude.   Does anyone know best practices to integrate marketing into a Scrum process? Or is there a different lightweight process that our marketing team could use? "
1250,How to set a specific resource in MS Project to have a max work capacity of 7 hours a day?,"I'm working on this slightly complicated project schedule in MS Project 2016.

For my project, I need to configure it such that although the custom project calendar that I'm using has an 8-hour work day for everyone, for one particular resource, I need the max work day to be 7 hours. How would I achieve this?  My thought was that I open the Resource sheet, select that reviewer, and edit their Resource Information to have a max availability of 87.5% (if 8 hours is 100% max capacity). Is this the right way to approach it? Or is their a better, more direct way to achieve this?  Any help would be very appreciated.   Thank you.  "
1251,pivotal tracker chore: At what rate velocity should increase,"The definition of velocity is “Just like a speedometer that measures how fast you’re hurtling through space, Tracker’s velocity is a measurement of how fast your team completes stories. Instead of miles or kilometers per hour, Tracker expresses velocity as the number of points completed per iteration.” (source: pivtoal blog)  What should be the ideal growth rate of team's velocity from one sprint to another? For example, if team is delivering 100 points in current sprint, what should be the expectation from the next sprint i.e. 102 points for 2% growth? "

In a sample website like Facebook, it has features like Login, Register, Write A Post and Chat.    Now, should I put those as an Epic? or as a Component? How should I categorize app's pages like Login page, Register page, Home page and Timeline page? Should I also make it as an epic, or a component? If we will put User Timeline as an epic for example, how do we classify the features like Write On Friends Timeline, Mention a Friend on timeline? Can we make it as a sub-epic?    I'm still new this software. I would appreciate every comment from you. It's much appreciated. Thanks! "

1256,How useful can a Project Manager be?,"I'm looking for some honest feedback.   I'm leaving my current position in a few days for a bigger company, better pay, better hours, etc. One of the main reasons I'm leaving though is the management structure at my current job.  There are only four employees in the entire advertising agency. A designer that reports to the owner, a PM that reports to the owner, and myself, who reports to the PM.   First big question: Does a 4 person company NEED a Project Manager, especially one dedicated to only a single employee?  Second big question: Does a PM need to have some understanding of the people they're managing? This PM has no technical experience, no development experience, and very little basic computer skills. I am a web developer. I code websites. I am the only developer in the company. Yet the PM makes design and technical changes on a whim, and ignores any and all feedback. Questioning illogical changes is considered ""combative"".  If every project is behind, who would be a fault? The Project Manager, who is determining what gets worked on and when, or the devloper who is doing as they are told?  If a deadline gets pushed, is that the developers responsibility? What about if a client is given a choice between A and B, and the client chooses B, is it the developers fault for coding A when told to do so?   Catch: The PM is the owners girlfriends best friend.  I may sound bitter, but I've been dealing with this for the past eight months since this PM was hired. Is this the norm, or an anomaly? "
1257,When is the best time to create automated test cases?,"When is the best time to write automated test cases? I understand that automated test cases are written in parallel or else by Test Driven Development.  But when should automated functional or regression test cases be written?  I am asking this question so that I may hire my automation team resources accordingly.   I assume that when the system will be somewhat ready after 2-3 releases, then I will hire automation testers. "
1258,How should we deal with interdependent tasks in Scrum?,"When talking about blockers on the Scrum board, I realized that we might have interdependent tasks. For example, database design is dependent on some activities in UX flow. Or maybe there is a later realization that one module requires some other module to be finished.   In an ideal case this should not happen, but nothing is ideal. Imagine if during the Sprint developer A is working on Task 1, which is dependent on completion of Task 2. Task 2 is part of the same Sprint. So, in such a case, we basically have reduced the number of parallel tasks in the Sprint.   In such a case, how should we handle Task 1? Should I remove it right away from the Scrum board, and replace it with another task? Or should I just let it be in the Sprint, till the next Sprint starts? What if there is more than one tasks like this in the Sprint? "
1259,How to show resource usage for the current project only?,"In MS Project, is there a way to show resource usage for the current Project only?

1261,Requirements Elicitation Technique For Unknown Workflow,"What elicitation technique(s) would you use for a workflow-dependent feature, where the workflow is largely unknown? Given a workshop with the primary user,the designer, the developer and the BA (me), what is the best tool for the job?  Context: We are working on the first release of a large-scale agile project. During a recent sprint planning, it became clear that stakeholders are not all on the same page regarding the requirements of a specific feature. The feature is part of an interface that will allow our content managers to preview web pages in different states and across different times. Since the concept of scheduled content is new to this release, there is a question of what the workflows will look like (and by extension how content managers will use the feature).  "
1262,Tracking external dependency stories,"Say you have three projects. Two of these projects are end-user facing products (Project A and B). The third is an infrastructure project (Project I) where all the work will never be directly delivered to the end user. Instead the end-user facing projects will consume the infrastructure in order to be able to deliver there projects. All three projects are running under agile development and have their own, unique backlogs and reporting.   How does Project A reflect a story from Project I in its backlog?   I know this would be a dependency story, I'm just not sure the best way to reflec it.    Shows as a zero point story in project A's backlog. Just listed as a dependency to whatever Project A end-user story relies on it Some other way?    Thanks... "

1264,How to manage cost of change / impact analysis with no funding?,"The PMBOK® Guide recommends that when a scope change request is submitted, an impact analysis is performed to assess how the change could affect the overall project. How does this work affect the overall project budget? Is it customary for the company to bear the costs of performing the impact assessment as part of the cost of doing business, or would you include that in the customer's bill for the change request?   What if it's determined that the changes cannot be actioned as part of the project? How would you prevent a project from going over-budget because of work spent on multiple impact analyses for change requests if there is no way to recoup the money from the customer for their requests?

About my team:   I have 4 people in my team, and they are older than me. Sometimes I feel uncomfortable instructing them because they are older than me 2 people are only part-time freelance workers.   About my project:   I'm developing a Web application using PHP; it's a recruitment site. I have 1 month to finish that project.   About me:   I'm a new project manager. I was a developer before this. My job is to make the schedule, create the project flow, and create the project environment.   Problem:   Deadlines are missed because we're adding many functions in that Web application. We have people with not-so-good skills for that project. The people who are freelancers will only have a little time to work.   Questions:  I've tried talking to my team about the missed deadlines, and they say they need more time to study the development environment. We choose to use FuelPHP as our development framework.   How should I communicate with them so they can follow my instructions? How to giving spirit for my team? What should I do with the people who don't have good skills?   Thanks to the people who have given me suggestions. "
1268,Should employees be allowed to vote for or against a feature request,We intend to implement a system that will allow users of our application to suggest new features (eg Uservoice) and vote for or against certain suggestions.

1271,How many hours a week should a project manager typically put in?,"I am considering two positions, one a formal PM job, the other a supervisory role within a functional organization.  I have gotten the impression that people who actually hold the PM job title work many hours.  One guy said he worked 80 hours straight once over Thanksgiving weekend to finish a project.  Of course, the textbooks would say that unplanned overtime is the result of poor project management, etc.   EDIT: Let me rephrase, so that this question doesn't get closed: What's the average amount of weekly hours a project manager should typically put in?  How can I tell if I'm being taken advantage of and am working too many hours? "
1272,"T-Shirt Size and total estimation, how to manage them?","I'm working on a project and the Product Owner has to decide if and how many new game-features implement in a SmartPhone app. Those game-features have the goal of keep the user more active inside the app. Currently those features were explained by the Product Owner in a rough way, not detailed, but in a more generic way.  We planned a session to analyse generically every feature, splitting them in macro areas to develop (Drupal, Frontend, Middleware, ...), to estimate them, not with points, but with t-shirt sizes and the goal was to understand effort, risks, reusability of common components. At the end this estimation should output sort of a charts of features, from the most efficient to the last.  With efficiency we should consider users interest (coming from a survey) and estimation sizes. But, how could you precisely analyse t-shirt sizes like XS, S, M, L, XL? Would you map them with 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and sum them? Or just check with gut feeling which one could be the most efficient to implement, just having a look at the sizes? "
1273,What are the metrics that can be analysed or derived from a Gantt Chart?,"Firstly, I am a programmer writing a software for analysing gantt charts.

1275,How do you manage a team of developers when their preferred working hours vary?,"I recently read a question on here about - How to balance Teamwork and Babble? - and David Espina's answer pointed out that despite developers being contracted as 100% FTE (full-time equivalents), in reality they only deliver between 45% and 75%.  For simplicity's sake, translating that statistic into hours implies that in a typical 8 hour day (9 to 5), developers only work around 4 to 6 hours.  Based on my experience at work, I would tend to agree with David. In other words, I have also found that developer stamina and / or willingness to work varies quite a bit from one developer to the next.  Some developers enjoy working 8 hours per day. Other developers experience stress when they work for prolonged periods of time and require regular breaks during the day in order to perform at their best.  In other words, a 4-hour per day developer (let's call him laid-back Larry) gets stressed if he is required to put in 8 hours per day. This reduces Larry's morale and thus impacts his long-term productivity.  Likewise an 8-hour per day developer (let's call him workaholic Winston) gets stressed when Larry takes regular breaks, because he feels like he's the one doing all the hard work whilst Larry is free-riding. But levelling the playing field by inviting Winston to work 4 hours per day instead of 8 results in a loss of long-term productivity as well.  So how do you manage a team of developers when their preferred working hours vary? "
1276,Net Promoter Score approach,"I've a question related to the NPS (net promotor score). Its use is based on the scale that goes from 0 to 10, as the attachment shows.   I'm collecting data from users with sort of feedback libraries. The user is invited to answer whith a smile (5 elements, from madness to love). So, talking about NPS:  does it make sense to you consider this chart based mapped on feelings (the one that I personally prefer)?   mad [DETRACTORS] angry [DETRACTORS] neutral [PASSIVES] happy [PROMOTERS] love [PROMOTERS]   or better to use this, because it reflects more the percentage / weight impact?   mad [DETRACTORS] angry [DETRACTORS] neutral [DETRACTORS] happy [PASSIVES] love [PROMOTERS]  "
1277,How to identify leader in a transformation project and are business analysts needed in a scrum environment?,"The company I'm currently working wants to deploy a workflow tool for its factories.  Issues are three-fold:   We don't have any business analysts who have the skills to create the business processes as we don't have any established business processes. The stakeholders (CEO,CFO) are pressing to start this project but we have trouble identifying someone who has enough seniority, with a 360° vision of the factory, ranging from accounting to production and who can herald this project in term of leadership and tacit agreement from every operational players. Last but not least, we are considering to use the Scrum methodology and we are uncertain that having business analysts would help.   The questions are the following:   Would it make sense to train business analysts instead of hiring them externally? Considering someone from the outside may not have enough field experiences, would someone from the inside of the factory be more effective? How can we identify that person within the organization who has enough influencing power and task that person to be the leader of this project? Would Scrum methodology makes sense and blend well with business analysts? I read that it may stir conflict with a Scrum culture but I maybe wrong.   Thanks in advance for any help you might be able to give.   Update     My question contains multiple questions that are linked together in the context of the company. However, they may be difficult to answer as a whole. If needed, I can break them into 2 distinct questions.  "
1278,Is the daily scrum 15mins meeting mandatory for successful scrum project?,"Is the daily scrum 15-minute meeting mandatory for a successful scrum project? Is it possible to replace it with a one hour meeting once or twice a week?  I am asking this because I am finding it difficult to hold daily 15-minute meetings with my project team since they are doing operational tasks (which are mandatory) outside of the project tasks (which are supplementary), so we agreed to do one hour meetings twice a week.

1279,Dealing with large specifications with Scrum,"From time to time, our product need to cope with new network protocols that comes in large specification files (~100+ pages). Usually, gathering the requirements from the specification can't be done by only one person, because it's large and prone to errors. On the other side, the development team feels demotivated doing this kind of analysis.  Given that, what are the alternatives to gather requirements from large specification files with Scrum? Should the PM take care of it with a specification team? Or the development team should be more suitable for this kind of task? The specification analysis should be time boxed into the sprint or it comes before Scrum can be applied? "
1280,How to factor in story points/tasks for non sprint related items?,"I understand that in general you create stories with story point complexity, and then define tasks and subtasks in which to mark time against, but how does this translate into items that are outside of any code development?  For example, you are part of an agile team and have a sprint in which you are expected to build and deploy code but at the same time you need to setup a new employee's PC that is starting next week.  How do you include this time? Is this part of the sprint or not? It seems like you need a way to track this time. Even though in my case I fully expect to finish the code for the sprint how would you handle this if it caused you to not finish the items for the sprint? From a management perspective it impacts burndown velocity, as well as at the end of the week if your hours show 3 hours not logged then management could assume you slacked off.  Another example could be something that pulls you off the sprint temporarily like troubleshooting a site outage, server crashes, etc.  How to factor in story points/tasks for non sprint related items, and how do you include tasks that weren't part of the original estimate, like building the PC? "
1281,What metrics should be used for tracking the quality of research project?,"It is known that software development tasks should be controlled by some project management metrics, that show the progress of work at each particular moment of time.  What metrics are better to be used if the project is a research and usual work consists of not only making a SW product, but (before that) reviewing and large corpus of scientific papers, making various PoC's? They key point here that at the beginning such project has no fixed architecture and just need to determine what's the best one.  In our project the ""done"" criteria are:   Our decided architecture decision is best We have implemented a piece of this architecture and it works This approach is new thus our project team is the best who continue the work on it. We have published a paper in the top conference/journal about our research.   In order to achieve this criteria we plan to:   search all possible directions in literature,  investigate how to apply these directions to our particular problem (because methods from papers can be described for adjacent but different applications), estimate how much effort will it take to implement each of approaches, estimate how much quality of SW product we can obtain by each approach (we already have this metric, it's deterministic in mathematical sense), compare different approaches and choose the best one, implement the best approach as a proof of concept, write and publish a paper about this approach.   What I need to know is that metrics are better to start with in this case? We need metrics that could be tracked on a weekly basis, i.e. they must show how much part of work is done. "
1282,How to design and organize a project?,"I have recently been hired for a job as a Bukkit plugin developer for a gaming website. As the projects become larger and more complicated, I am finding it more and more neccassary to carefully design the components of my project before I begin coding. I am having difficulty deciding which components I should begin designing and coding first. I ask myself questions like ""Should I start with the config, or the listeners, or maybe the I/O layer?"".  Here is my question:  How do you as professionals organize your project components and decide which components require the most attention? "
1283,What are the benefits of having fixed length sprints for agile?,"Lately, I have been the solo developer on a software development project and I break down my project into functionality that I believe I should be able to implement in 1 or 2 weeks depending on the feature.  Sometimes I get my estimate wrong. Examples:  a) I estimate a week and the feature takes 1/2 a week to finish b) I estimate 2 weeks but the feature set takes 3 weeks to finish.  Why not just set your goals for the iteration and finish them in the time it takes rather than have a fixed iteration that you miss by finishing too soon or too late? What are the benefits of a fixed iteration development time? "
1284,How can we prevent project professionals from sabotaging the project schedule?,"I work with an organization that hires professionals with temporary contracts that last for the length of the particular projects they are working on. At the moment, these contracts are usually just a fixed rate per day.  This situation creates an incentive for these contractors to sabotage the schedule of their projects, so that the project takes longer to complete, and thereby lengthen their contracts.  It does appear that this behavior is going on. They are various techniques being used. A common one appears to be raising an ""issue"" or a ""concern"" which is actually bogus, or ""making a mountain out of a molehill"", but which nevertheless causes wasted time as this concern is addressed.  However, it is difficult for managers to know at the outset that an issue raised was not even worth investigation, and it could be the case that someone honestly raised a concern that turned out to not be a problem.  Although it is difficult to know for sure in any single instance that a contractor is sabotaging, it is clear from overall statistics that the practice goes on. (e.g. it happens more when the economy is down and contractors won't find another job).  So the question is this: Are there any internal controls that can be adopted to help deal with this behavior? Is anyone aware of any incentive schemes/contract terms that could replace the fixed rate per day that have worked in dealing with this problem elsewhere? "
1285,What is a good workflow for hiring freelancers?,"Should I allow the freelancer to clone my entire repository to work on my code? Is this safe?  I don't feel like giving a complete stranger access to my entire code base.  Basically, how do I use the tool Git in project management to facilitate development with out having my entire web app completely open? "
1286,How to Introduce innovative change in organizational processes when upper management defends status quo,"I have been involved in a couple of project for the past year, and I have been lucky to work with the brilliant team. I noticed that in each of these project there seem to be one or two persons who always have great ideas. One of them is what I like to call the technology champion ""Hey, why don't we use technology X to speed up certain processes or task in the project?""  The other one is what I like to call a process champion; they will point out insufficient processes in a project and propose new ways for improving it. For example, our test team had a difficult time doing regression test, and he proposed to automate some of the repetitive test task.   We really see the value in their ideas, but somehow selling them to the upper management can be very very difficult. Are there any strategy that you like to use to obtain support from the organization for supporting innovative ideas? "
1287,Consulting and separating internal and external tickets,"So, I'm helping an agile software consulting company to create a workflow between themselves and their customers.  The goal is to provide the customer with an Agile way of approving features (stories) before they are developed, and then accepting them (or not) when they are delivered.  The consultants are already using User Stories within their internal system (TFS), but those are much more granular than would be appropriate for surfacing to the customer.  In fact, while the customer should be able to approve and reject feature level items, they should not be able to directly view or edit stories that are assigned to the developers.  Has anyone had any experience with trying to manage this separate of concerns using just Team Foundation Server / Visual Studio Online?  How did you configure it?  I'm considering a separate area and team for the customers, or perhaps a separate Team Project. "
1288,What to do with work not on the board?,"TL;DR: At some point, someone on the team will have work which can justifiably not go on the board. How is this handled in a sprint team when it is a long running thing?  Our team's technical leader has a number of things to be working on to support the team, which only that person can do (because of responsibility, contractual obligations, skill/knowledge level or system access permissions). Should that work go on the board?  The above is a fairly simple Yes, in my mind.  The problem is that the work in question may want to be kept away from the rest of the team because it might cause a distraction (it may result in their current work being disposed of at a later date but for valid reasons), it might simply be more interesting (another distraction they may waste time debating), or that including it in the daily scrum and other ceremonies exposes it to certain product owners who do/should not need to know about it.  Compounding the problem is that higher management accepts that there is certain work which technical leaders take on which is ""off board"" but still valuable. Much of this is exploratory/PoC type work and (regardless of where the budget comes from) is required but not team story related.  Further, that work is also (by it's exploratory nature) nearly impossible to estimate as it is often very ""blue sky"".  How should this work be handled?  Should the technical leader simply report that they deliver a lower amount of time to the team's sprints than regular team members or should we absolutely commit to having everything on the board, regardless? Or somewhere in between? "
1289,Who is the stakeholder of an user-driven application and what software methodology is suitable for it?,"I'm new here and I am confused about something. Sorry if the question doesn't fit and not suitable here.  For the application like foursquare and yelp which focuses entirely on feedback of the user around the world instead of user in specific organization, who is their main stakeholder? What software methodologies would they use if their main stakeholder is the user instead of top management in an organization?  Thanks! "

In which layer(s) do they lie? And what are the associated tools?     As I understand TDD : Unit Testing layer : junit, jasmine BDD : Cucumber tool : Which layer? It should be Integration BDD : Cucumber tool + Selenium tool : Which layer? It should be E2E (End To End) ATDD : ?  "
1291,New IT project documentation,"When there is a new IT project, what documentation should we begin with? What structure do they usually have. Is there a common standard to compose them?  I am entirely new to IT projects, I am investigating and would happy to receive support from more experienced  community.   "
1292,Transitioning Postmortem data after a project is done,"One of the things I wish I did more often and better is follow through with the data collected during a Postmortem.  I'm looking for input on ""How do you ensure the postmortem data is followed up and dealt with -after- the project is done and you have moved on to another project?""  Specifically, I'm looking for thoughts on ""Is it the PM's job to ensure the postmortem is acted upon, or does that responsibility transition to owners of the individual items or to the functional management team?""  Thanks! "
1293,Network analysis question,I have an  Activity i has a SF relationship with 3 days of lag with activity j. i starts on Tuesday morning and is 2 days long. j is 4 days long. When will j begin?   How do you calculate the dates? 
1294,Accuracy of Estimates,"Aclear16, on an answer from another question, brought up the notion of accuracy of estimates.  In my view, this notion is nonsensical; however, we talk about this often in PM circles.    In an estimating training class I taught, I wanted to demonstrate the effects of random variability on projects, results that occur secondary to the plethora of variables over which we have little to no control.  To do this, I literally, with a time watch, tracked my time from door to door, coming and going, my commute to and from work for over a year.  I plotted the results:    (Yes, I hate my commute.)  So, if a commute was a project and I was wanting to target accurately, with this historical data as input to our estimating exercise, where does accuracy live?  If I choose ""65"" minutes, a slightly more pessimistic target over the MODE, and I arrived at 75, is my estimate ""not accurate""?  Conversely, if I plan at ""80"" and arrive in ""50"", is that also not accurate?  So here's the ultimate question:  what does an accurate estimate mean?  (This is question that really does not have an answer and likely violates the rules; however, I hope we can entertain this as I think it is valuable to understanding a very important process in project management.  I am hoping some good critical thought and discussion will ensue.  Thanks to aclear16 for triggering this!) "
1295,How to manage a multidisciplinary project/company?,"For example... someone who is a computer engineer and his expertise is machine vision or voice recognition or totally machine learning (ML) fields. But we know a robot has electrical parts and mechanical parts as well. Also, it's possible to consider we might like to create an application on Web/Windows/Mac/Android/ios for our robot too! And many other possible extra conditions.  So, our founder/project manager is a great man in the ML field but not in web/mobile/electronics/mechanics and other fields of engineering that may needed for the company. Then, how should he manage people with other areas of expertise and evaluate if they are the best people to choose and hire? To do they their jobs well (I mean, there is no better/easier/less expensive way to do that job)? And when one of them is stuck in his/her job and couldn't find the solution, how can he help him/her to get the job done? "
1296,What is the point of a risk with no impact?,"Forgive me if this doesn't belong here, but I thought this more appropriate for PM than for Programmers or SO.  We use risk assessments where I work as part of the software development life-cycle. A matrix of impact (sometimes referred to as severity) versus likelihood is used to establish absolute risk. One of the levels of impact (or severity) is ""None"" which I take to mean 'if this happened there would be absolutely no impact'.  Have I missed something? I've asked colleagues but no one seems to be able to come up with a meaningful answer. What is the point of defining a risk which has no impact? Surely that is not a ""risk"" that is just 'something which can happen' and has no business on a risk assessment. "
1297,User Stories in JIRA for a project that covers several platforms,"We are working on a project that (roughly) consists of following parts:   back-end application, central communication server, and client applications for several platforms.   Our ""team"", on the other hand, consists of several one-man teams, each person working on a different part of the project.  We are using JIRA+Agile. We have created a single project in JIRA, and a component is created for each above mentioned part. Each issue is assigned to correct component(s). This goes mostly for Epics and Story issue types, where it actually makes sense.  We write user stories in such a fashion so that PO can see clearly what is gained by completing this story (i.e. allow user to see his inbox). We tend to create stories that are granular enough so that they can be reasonably completed within a sprint. Actual development tasks are created as sub-tasks of main Story issue. We estimate our stories by playing Planning Poker, even though different people might really have different amounts of work involved in each story, and it makes sense for us.  This approach allows us to also track progress of implementing complex, new functionality across all components (Epics) by breaking it down into discrete Stories, and then creating sub-tasks for each task that needs to be performed. As tasks are resolved, stories auto-complete themselves, which is all nice and sweet, and we are generally satisfied with how it all works.  However... We are going to build another client application for a different platform (part of the same project). The work we will need to perform is already well defined in existing Stories, as most of that work has been completed in other client applications for other platforms. The trouble is, all those stories are already completed! And, furthermore, amount of story points for each Story is estimated long ago...  One way is to duplicate all user stories, regarding existing client apps, redefine them a bit to make it clear which platform they are targeting, re-estimate them for that platform.. Another way is to basically create a user story for each piece of work that needs to be done on each platform, BUT, this approach will break entire process from the point of view of PO, thus breaking desired functionality into several (probably not equally readable) stories... Maybe it was a mistake to create a single project for all components? But, it was driven by the fact that client apps for each platform would basically replicate each other at least 90%, so there would be a lot of overlap and duplicated issues...  Question: What would be a good way to organise such a project using JIRA and Agile, that would allow us to work in similar way that we already do, but that would also allow us greater flexibility when adding new components that would basically have to replicate functionality already implemented in other client apps?  Thanks for reading ;) "
1298,Which frameworks can be used with PMBoK?,Which frameworks can be used with PMBoK? Which frameworks are related with PMBoK? 
1299,How do you measure time units in sprint velocity?,"I am trying to get my head around ""Story points"" using the Scrum methodology. As a starting point, I have been following the following article:  [website]With my team we are using the t-shirt sizes (S, M, L, and too big) approach. Using this approach, how do we quantify the time for each user story?  Is doing:   S = 1/2 a day (maximum) M = a day (maximum) L = 2 days (maximum)   a good approach? "
1300,Project Management for Inconsistent Development Efforts,"I am a CS grad student, and I am interested in applying project management or software/system engineering methods to research projects at my university.  I have experience applying the Scrum framework for small development teams, but I do not believe such a management framework would be applicable here.  Let us use Project A as an example.  Here are some characteristics of Project A:   Roughly 50-75% of the effort of Project A is a technical solution that includes aspects of electrical engineering, physics, biology, chemistry, and computer science. Ideally, the initial effort of Project A would take less than a year to complete Anywhere from 2 to 12 people may be working on the project at any given time, with each individual having their own schedules and priorities The time commitments from each individual could vary widely (an administrator/professor might commit a few hours a week to facilitate the allocation of resources, another professor may be writing the research paper, a grad student may be involved for 40 hours a week for a few weeks in the summer to write a program, another student may commit a few hours a week for the entirety of the year to integrate electrical systems, and so forth).  It may be possible to hold weekly meetings of sub-teams, but monthly meetings would be more realistic (if meetings are even necessary) At this time there is not a defined set of requirements.  There are some vague use cases that can be refined into functional requirements, but there would need to be a somewhat substantial effort to refine the system being development into sets of technical requirements.   Project A is still in its infancy (conceptual discovery phase, perhaps?).  By applying software/system engineering or project management methods to this project I can vaguely imagine the facilitation of:   communication among team members, the thorough understanding of functional requirements while implementing the technical solutions, coordination of implementation efforts, and the collections of basic metrics (such as person-hours, defects per person-hour, or others)   As I mentioned earlier, I do not think that Scrum would be at all applicable to manage the technical solution of Project A.  My experience in implementing technical solutions involves predictable and consistent commitments of time, even if the teams are distributed geographically or across multiple time zones.  However, I am unfamiliar with managing a project where people may intermittently start or stop working because they have other priorities in the organization (the organization being the university, in this case).  What methods of project management, development life cycles, or software/system engineering could benefit Project A? "
1301,Whose responsibility is it to encourage/ensure knowledge flow across Agile teams?,"I am working with larger and larger organizations adopting Agile. One discussion recently has kept me thinking about a challenge I hadn't been paying attention to heretofore. That is, how do we create approaches, working agreements, and technologies for knowledge flow across teams? I don't want to push ""standards"". I do want to make team-level knowledge move outside the team. I'm torn about whether to find a ""push"" approach (i.e. here is all the latest ""stuff"" we've seen) or a ""pull"" approach (i.e. if you are interested, we've collected a lot of information.) Ideas?  I had an idea spring to mind yesterday. Wouldn't it be great to have an internal StackExchange!?  Thoughts for or against such an approach within an organization?  I'm still looking for something more specific. If we can't capture persistent knowledge a la StackExchange, what can we do? This can be larger than Agile. I just happen to be most curious about Agile knowledge flow given the sense of pulling emergent practices versus pushing prescriptions. "
1302,Assign Resources Automatically in the Most Efficient Manner,"Firstly I have to state that I am not a project manager. I am a software development team leader that has been tasked with giving a plan for a large project for my team. We work in a Scrum-like environment where tasks are not assigned and, for the sake of this problem, each member can pick up any task that's been planned for that month.  I have been trying to use MS project to create a plan for me where tasks are ordered by priority and then leveled by resource and priority. However I seem to be able to only do this with tasks I have assigned. To try to replicate the idea that assignee doesn't matter I have created 8 resources (""Developer A"", ""Developer B"" etc) but the timeline is massively impacted because assigning these in the most efficient manner is proving pretty difficult. All I am trying to get out of assignee is to make sure that only 8 tasks are in flight at any one time.  What I'd like to do is set the priority and let the tool assign all tasks in the most efficient manner. Is there any way to do this? Or is there a different approach that I could take to ensure only 8 tasks are concurrently being worked on, at any given time? "
1303,How do you cost for an agile ux project?,"Hi I work for a small digital agency where we do a lot of ux work and therefore a lot of planning and research. The culture and approach to development projects we have moved to in recent years makes use of a lot of agile 'aspects' albeit it's not perfect. Our approach is rooted in being flexible and adaptive to changing project scopes. But as far as scoping and costing for projects there is something I cant get my head around. Typically projects are quoted for upfront on a fixed price basis, based on what we estimate it will involve but in my experience the true scope and requirements/features of a project don't truly come to light until after we do the user research and personas and establish goals, which inform the scope of the project, the type of user stories which will added to the backlog and therefore the cost. But obviously there is a lot of work involved up to this point which needs to be paid for also. With this in mind, is there a better way to quote for a project, eg what order should all of this be done in to make it more accurate? Does it ultimately still have to come down to estimating something upfront that you can't truly know until later on?  With that in mind, during a project there are the inevitable changes to scope as it develops, some minor and some that grow legs. With an agile approach, using sprints and a backlog of stories etc, it makes it easier to identify where scope changes are happening but I am curious how others deal with this in terms of identifying things that are going to cost more and letting the client know the cost will be higher. For example is there an alternative to upfront fixed costing, like having an open ended costing approach? (one that clients will actually go for). After all this is the point of agile, that the scope can grow but we can adapt, both from a development point of view but also so we are not doing a lot of free work. "
1304,Do you use fixed sprint length based on continued calendar days or workdays?,"I'd love to hear from more experienced agilists the considerations to use on or another method.  If you live in a country (like mine) with so many holidays, do you set the sprint size based on continued calendar days (i.e: always start on Thursdays of each week for sprints with week duration) or do you consider available workdays? (in this example, if you have a holiday on Friday, the Sprint will finish on next Thursday and the following sprint will start on Friday shifting weekday setup)  Have you tried booth? Why? Why not? "
1305,Allocation of resources during morning scrum?,"I find that process to be a bit confusing, but from the time I've been here, I get the impression that resource allocation happens during the morning scrum meetings. So for example, if Dev A has 8 tasks and Dev B has 6 tasks, Dev A will work on the two most important tasks for the current day and Dev B will work on the most important task for the day.  The next day's scrum is set up the same, i.e. decide what task gets work on based on its priority. For some reason, this is throwing me off as a new PM because I can't allocate resources at the time of creating the project. So my process is simply to:   Create the WBS Plot the schedule (gantt, critical path, etc.) Client communication   While I'll assigned a dev for my project for the duration of the project, it can get postponed depending on the fire that the Dev has to put out on a certain day.  How do I advise the company on handling its resources properly in such a situation? Has anyone else been in a situation where the morning scrum is also the time to decide what fires are put out for the day? "
1306,What is the process for deciding WIP limits for each column in a team's kanban board?,"Is there a process to guide the initial WIP number decisions for kanban board columns apart from picking a rough number and seeing how it works out?  Secondly, what metric(s) do you monitor to determine if WIP limits are set too high or too low? e.g. if the number of people on a team changes, the WIP numbers may need to adjust to reflect the change in the team. Or... could a team set their WIP too high just to avoid breaking the limit... So, are there metrics that can be monitored to determine if a team's WIP is correct? "
1307,What details recommended to be mentioned in my resume as project manager?,"If applying for project manager job, what are the best practices to highlight my previous/current managed projects and what project management skills to be highlighted in my resume?  How those projects / skills better arranged and highlighted in attractive, simple and to the point way?  Should I mention projects name, scope, total spent time, number of members per project? What kind of information that's catchy to interviewer/employer? "
1308,Who pays when actuals exceed pessimistic estimates?,"Scenario:  A Developer estimates between 70 to 100 hours for a task. Due to the urgency of the task and the developer's unavailability, a far less experienced developer is assigned to the project. The new developer takes 200 hours to complete the task.  Questions:   From a risk and stakeholder management perspective, what should have the PM done to mitigate and communicate the issue to senior management when realizing the initial estimate was going to get blown out of the water? Given that the original developer's estimate was more or less on track, should the excess 100 hours be applied to the project?   A. Or should those 100 hours be eaten up by the management team (company ""investment""), which would mean the project's budget sheet would 100 hours only and on track? Is this misleading and not telling the true story?  B. Or should the full 200 hours be reflected on the project's budget sheet and let the issue logs tell the story?  I have seen in smaller agencies where if a developer goes over his initial estimate, he ""pays"" for it. This would happen if the issue is due to the developer's fault (example: misunderstood a portion of the requirements and not seeking clarification).   In such a scenario, the developer is told not to clock his time to the project and should spend the additional time needed to get the task done.  Similar to 2A, is this not misleading? Rather, shouldn't it be documented in the Issue Log and Lessons Learned to prevent a future repeat of the error?  "
1309,"What are the tasks that project manager should NOT do, but delegate instead?","If you work in a startup environment (less than 20 people), you will see yourself working not only on project manager's tasks, but also on business analyst's, sale's, etc...  Gradually, your company grows and it allows you to hire more people to support your team. Now it's the time you keep your core responsibilities and tasks and delegate the rest.  What should you keep? What should you delegate as soon as possible?   EDITED: In general, we do not have ""right"" answer for management questions like this. But I'm seeking answers either in 2 ways:   Answers that describe the approaches to the problem. Answers that tell about real story/experience and the result.  "
1310,1 Hour to 2.5 Long Scrums Every Day - Is this Crazy?,"The team has   ten developers one development manager one tech lead one project manager over eight projects going on at once everything is top priority   Every day there is a hour long call called scrum that goes over every single item in the sprint and provide updates. Even though there is a team, the projects discussed are not related to each other, but their own unique application, they do interact with each other but at a very very small scale. Management requires for the whole team to stay and listen.  In addition, there is another hour long call three times a week, where other projects are discussed, providing updates on each item.   How would you advise appropriate alternatives to make sure sprint items do not fall to the wayside?  Even with these long meetings, there is a real lack of transparency to the overall long-term vision of the product.  In addition, how would you advise making sure the team understands the different projects going on that they are mandated to support?  What calls would you make? What decisions would you take? "
1311,User Story versus Task in Jira,"I am learning about the agile/scrum process, and currently using it for a 6 month software project at my university.  My team is using Jira.  I am starting to get confused between the difference between ""tasks"" and ""stories"".  I had thought that ""story"" aligns with ""user story"", which was one of the mechanisms we used to define our requirements.  Each requirement on our project has a user story associated with it.  I was told that the agile process is different because it keeps the ""user"" perspective in mind while developing.  It made sense in my mind that a user story maps to a ""story"" in Jira.  However, I read that in Jira Agile there is no difference between a task and a story.  My team has been creating subtasks for every story, but I was told this was wrong, and that our stories are too large and need to be broken down.  For example, one story was ""I want to be able to sign up for a free account to use the system"".  This obviously involves many subtasks.  We ARE creating subtasks under the stories, but we were told the story itself is too big.  How would I ""break this story down into smaller stories""?  A user wouldn't have a story about something technical, like ""Set up a database server"".  I was told to make stories like ""as a developer, I want to install a database server so that I can store new user information"".  This doesn't make sense to me, because we were previously told not to consider a developer as a user.  So, my question really is why is it wrong to create a story that consists of many subtasks?  Is this just a choice that the team makes, or is there actually use cases for the difference between a task and a story?  Thank you. "
1312,Is there a difference between the PMP and the CAPM in terms of what to study?,"I have seen that many websites claim that they have brain dumps for CAPM like they said they have for CISCO, Java and Microsoft. I am strictly saying that I am not going to use those dumps and nor I recommend anyone to use that because they do nothing but decrease your knowledge. But I am curious to know this:  Will the study material for the CAPM certification be different than the study material for the PMP? What is the difference?  Does CAPM have a definite set of questions for the exam like CISCO, Java and Microsoft? "
1313,How often and when should you change WIP limits?,"I'm testing out Kanban on my research team and I think we're okay for now. We've visualized our workflow and set limits to the tasks. I'm using Kanban in Action for reference. I've set an initial WIP limit of 8 tasks for now (2 per member of my team). There are times when it works and times when it doesn't. My question is, how often and when do I change the limit? Can I do it in the middle or the week? or is it preferable to do it during retrospectives?  "
1314,How much does Lean Software Development really has to do with the original concept of lean manufacturing?,"We are seeing more emphasis on the concept of Lean Software Development, especially by the Agile community.  It's definitely exciting to imagine that the software industry can be as productive, efficient and effective as other traditional areas where the Toyota Production System is used literally.  But to what extent the concepts of Agile are related to the original TPS? What points are equivalent? And what points differ?  And the most important question: can we achieve a truly lean software production, as the original Lean dictates? "
1315,How to include front end developers and QA into the estimation process?,"We are team of 3 Back-end developers, 3 Ios developers, 1 QA, 1 Product Owner and 1 SM, working on a Social App. We are interested to do this using the agile methodology with the Scrum framework. We are new to agile/Scrum and are having some difficulty implementing them. We are in Sprint 0 and already wrote user stories and wanted to estimate them.  We have the following questions:   Who should be included in the estimation process other than developers? How can ios developers estimate the effort of back-end developers? Same goes for Designers and QA. If everyone will estimate his/her own effort then how can the SM get a single story point estimate?  "
1316,Prioritizing Features,"Question for fellow product owners/product managers.  How do you prioritize your features?  We are currently trying to develop some common criteria (as objective as possible) that we can use to prioritize our features.  At the very least, we want something that will give us a good starting point and potentially things to look at when we get the inevitable question of why are we working on this instead of that.  Does anyone have some good suggestions?  How do you all address this problem? "
1317,Would/should the PM define the code style for a software project?,"In terms of specifying the actual code/syntax style that all developers should use in a project, should the project manager do this? Or would that be under the realm of a technical lead/lead developer? Or would it vary from organization to organization? Or all of the above?  I ask because I feel having uniform, readable, commented code is extremely important for a project's success because it makes debugging and maintenance so much easier - so this seems like it'd be under the PM realm. "
1318,Will hiring an agile coach make that much of a difference?,"My company is still young, and our processes still inadequate.  I want to get the scrum process right from the start.  Would hiring an agile coach make that much of a difference even if I've done nothing but read and research implementation methods of scrum and other agile methods?  What are the typical rates for someone with these qualifications?  What is the usual process that goes into agile coaching? I would love to hear from both someone who has been coached as well as an agile coach themselves. "
1319,Should I word backlog items as what's broken or what work needs to be done?,"We have a software project that we are trying to implement some basic project management for and we're starting simple, just using a Trello kanban board to track bugs/feature requests. I am beginning to transfer items from our in-house help desk system (which doesn't have any tracking features, it's basically just a record of user-submitted tickets with some searching and email built in) into a Trello board called ""&lt;insert product name here&gt; Backlog"". In this board, we have Bug and Feature filters, as well as additional filters indicating what section of the app it relates to.  I'm conflicted on whether items should be worded as what is broken or as what work needs to be done. For example, if I have a help desk ticket that says ""Financials on this page have a rounding error"", do I create a card with that wording, or should I call it ""Fix rounding error on x page""? Or, as a third option, do I word it as what ""should be""? I.e. ""Page should have no rounding errors"". Perhaps this is an X/Y problem and I'm trying to do too much with this board, but I don't know.  I am a developer turned accidental project manager with no prior PM experience, so any and all advice is appreciated. Not looking to become a scrum master here — I quite like software engineering — I just want to learn and implement some best practices. "
1320,Creating 'User Stories' when a developer needs to learn how to use the tech to complete it (Scrum),"So a user story describes what the user wants to achieve.  I use trello, here is how I would do it:  Epic - Create a home page Story (Trello Card) - 'As a user I want to see sliding images on the top of the page' Tasks (A checklist) - list of technical tasks needed to achieve that story.   Get images Integrate JQuery plugin which is a carousel  Import images into the carousel Test   Now what if the problem at this stage is if the development team has not got the skills to do that story. Before they can do it, they need to learn HTML/JQuery/CSS???  Currently to handle this, I would create a Trello card.  ""Learning phase""  Checklist:   Learn HTML Learn CSS Learn JQUERY   This is NOT a user story, but I put this into the sprint.  How do you handle this? "
1321,What kind of peripheral information do you put on a Kanban board?,"We are currently in my team in the process of applying Kanban to our project. It's currently a very iterative process which is not (yet) meeting the expected success.  However, we noted that the big whiteboard we set in the office has drawn a lot of attention from all the project members, not for the different cards displayed but regarding the peripheral information we display, such as:  - Next build date.  - General Project goals  - Short-Term project planning (next releases, next events ...).  We would like to build on this and see if we could dedicate a part of our whiteboard to be more or less a project dashboard, with two intentions in mind:  - Getting attraction from the developers on what's going on on the Kanban board.  - Improving our communication about project status/important information (which are currently usually sent by email to all the project team).  What are the therefore in your team the peripheral information you are displaying on your Kanban boards? How much space do you dedicate to those informations? How did you determine which information was critical to be displayed to the team?  "
1322,How to manage a research project online?,"We will soon start a research project (longitudinal study for 2-3 years) with a team of 7 (+ interns). I think these are pretty prototypical conditions for psychological research.  requirements clash with business-oriented project management tools   flat hierarchy, so tasks aren't usually assigned by a superior unusual working hours – most workers are student helps that work part time and a lot of our assessments (the main time-eating work) will take place after the usual 9to5  so we would try to find someone who is free that afternoon to conduct an assessment session quite often – this entails keeping people in the loop without email ie. text messages we would like to track hours  we'll share a lot of scientific literature and might collaborate in tagging, excerpting etc.   some custom stuff is needed  We're almost sure that we'll need to program our custom solution for organizing the assessments. We need all participants to choose possible dates and as soon as 4 participants choose the same date and someone is available to lead the assessment session, the date should be blocked, they should be notified and also reminded by text messages. It's kind of like doodle.com+tetris - probably to specific?  my main question   Do you know of a project-management tool that makes sense for such an environment? Are we better off   mixing different purpose-built web apps (we now use Gmail, GoogleGroups, Dropbox, Zotero, Google Calendar, Google Docs + would need some sort of time tracker),  risk redundancy (Dropbox ∩ Docs ∩ Zotero ∩ Gmail) and  lose integration (it would be great to have something that is both calendar and time tracker, but maybe we should at least stay with the Google products that are somewhat integrated) ?  Is there a third way? I found Charm and cloudHQ which promise to integrate Dropbox and project management. Charm doesn't add much value and cloudHQ is still in alpha. But I generally like the idea to assemble my much-used tools into something less redundant and better integrated.  "
1323,Should a good project manager be a good risk manager and a good estimator as well?,"I'm taking project management class.  It is hard to understand the relationship between estimation, risk management, and project management. Could you explain it based on your experience?  My lecturer said a good project manager must be a good estimator. I don't know that sentence clear true,  because he also said estimation is guess so estimation is always wrong. Those are not contradiction?  Must a good project manager be a good estimator as well and why? And another: must a good project manager be a good risk manager and again why? This is part I'm finding hard to understand. What is the relation between estimation and risk management?  When I read my textbook, everything looks vague for me. There is no clear explanation of the relationships (estimate, risk management, project management).  How I can approach these issues to understand clearly? Could you recommend a book that has some explanation my curious? "
1324,IT Consultant engagement in a project,"I have been asked as an IT consultant to help an insurance company to upgrade their legacy Information management system to more reliable and user friendly one which has to last for the next 7 years. I work for a consultation firm that has been asked to evaluate the project, review financial costs and set a plan to the management team.  As a consultant, what documentations do need to do for the project? and also what tasks do I need to start with ? I have done a briefed document reviewing the company's legacy system and how it works based on my first meeting with the people involved!  I am new on this business and any help would be much appreciated.    "
1325,Best way to do peer code reviews in the development process,"In our company, we use Scrum with short sprints of 1 or 2 weeks and peer code reviews as a requisite, but I'm still trying to figure out which is the best ""flow"".   One option could be doing the code reviews pre-commits, but that holds tasks until the reviewer can finish them, the reviewer has more pressure, the tasks take longer to complete and may have idle developers if tasks are dependent.  The other option is post-commit, but with this option the code reviews become low priority,  the feedback comes late (so comments and suggestions can be outdated) and in general it does not add much value since the code may be already released.  Which is the best ""flow"" for peer reviews? What is your experience? "
1326,Is Comptia's Project+ certification respected/respectable?,What do people think of this certification? Is it something to advertise if you have it? 
1327,How to reuse done user stories without rewriting/duplicating them,"Just to outline the current situation first.  We've recently had an QA tester added to the team on an existing project. The project has user stories in previous sprints which outline the objective, denote acceptance criteria and contain the tasks required to implement said user story.  Now that the tester has joined the team with the intention of automating the unit testing and acceptance testing for the aforementioned features he needs user stories and acceptance criteria added to the next sprint.  There are over 100 user stories which currently exist in previous sprints which now need automating.  Do I create new user stories to the same effect and copy and paste the acceptance criteria etc into the new user stories?  My other option is to move the old user stories into the new sprint and remove the done status on them. The problem with this in TFS is that the previous sprint will then have no user stories in it and therefore no record of what was completed during that time.  How do others approach this problem? "
1328,What does PMP Certification guarantee about a person?,"If someone has written PMP on their resume. What can I assume that they know about project management?  Would they know what is scrum, extreme programming, waterfall, etc? Would they know which methodology to chose and when?  What is safe to assume about a person with PMP Certification?  EDIT: Alternate wording of the question is what is taught to a PMP and what is he tested against? "

I want to read about your recommendations for a great Project Management text book.  I also would like to know why so. 
1330,Is Software Architecture still Relevant in Agile ?,"Agile focuses on developing workable codes from small user stories. Pair programming encourage developers to pair up, actively engage with one another to come up with the best solution for the problem. Design and code are actively reviewed, refined, until it reaches a state where everyone is confident that the software is maintainable and robust for the customers.   Agile transforms the command and control mechanism, where architects dictate what the design should be, into a democratic process that gives everyone the autonomy for designing the system. This leads to the question, is a software architect still relevant in Agile? Does Agile slowly transform the role of an architect into something else? "
1331,Are there any specific steps to go from a software developer to project manager?,"I'm a software developer with five years of experience and I want to start a career as a project manager. Today I'm seeking for a new job, related to management where I find myself much more valuable due to my communication skills. But it's kinda hard, because all the positions ask for previous experience, and although I have experience in project management (I'm the head developer on my team and we don't have a PM, so I end up being the PM and not coding at all) I don't have any explicit experience or course/certification.  I believe many of you are project managers in IT companies, so I ask you: are there any known steps to go from a software developer to project manager? Have you seen any successful case? Should the developer start courses on the subject? Or it's easier to start acting as a PM and get experience from that (like I did)? The knowledge on software development is a plus?  PS: I'm sorry if the question is not actually a question with only one possible answer, but I think some people here might share the same doubt. Feel free to close the question if you think it's off-topic or it doesn't belong here. "
1332,Is Certified Scrum Master valuable?,"What is the value in Certified Scrum Master certifications?  I'll be quite honest in saying that I've never put a lot of thought into such certifications, but it seems like if you are interested in Agile and wanting to deepen your understanding, that the two day class + test is a worthwhile investment.  Is the CSM valuable? "
1333,How does PRINCE2 map to ITIL? Specifically Product Descriptions vs. Service Design Packages,"What are the tangents or points of contact between PRINCE2 and ITIL?  E.g. can I say ""A PRINCE2:Product Description IS A(N) ITIL:Service Design Package""? Or can I state that with some qualifications?  Or is it too complex to put in these terms?  I am looking for a couple of contact points, or a Web link to a white paper ;)  Background: I am PRINCE2 Practitioner certified and currently reading up to go for ITIL Foundation as well, but I am not yet familiar with the practicalities of ITIL at a design level.  Any kind of starting points here would be helpful as I need to write some of these descriptions of how a service should behave in an ITIL-controlled environment. "
1334,'Early Start' equals actual start date,I am working on a project and the 'Early Start' column reads exactly the same as the actual 'start' column (following team assignment and task scheduling) for some fields.  I understand that the early start should in fact be the earliest I could possibly start it given constant 100% work rate on all tasks? Possibly my terminology is wrong?  I have extensive links but non on (or referencing) summary tasks.  Can any one offer an explanation or workaround? 
1335,What questions can a Scrum Master ask during Sprint Grooming,"During a Sprint grooming, as a facilitator (optional) of the meeting, SM can ensure that event takes place, is time bound, conversation is focussed on the topic, makes sure Acceptance Criteria, Estimations are provided.  What other specific questions can a SM ask during grooming without sounding like a Manager or exceeding the authority?  For example, can SM ask any of the following questions?   How will you test it? Who will use it? How will we know when it’s done? What assumptions are we making?  "
1336,Separation of multi-team project into several projects,"When should a multi-team project be split to run as separate projects?  Where lays the border, when something should be run as separate project?  Case:        3 feature teams (DEVs+QAs) working on product backlog items (features, bug fixes), and use automated acceptance tests package at   a final stage of feature verification.   1 AQA team, who create automated acceptance tests packages (mentioned before) to test the product from client perspective. This   package is delivered to the client and to feature teams.         Currently this is run as one project, but maybe it is better to split   them into 2?   I came up with the following possible criteria for separation:  1. Different release cycles and periods 2. Different life time 3. Different workflows and definition of done 4. Possibility to identify clear independent (from other teams) deliverables   Are there any other criteria to consider or maybe mine are redundant? "
1337,Difference between sprint backlog and sprint goal?,"One of the questions while PSM I™ Preparation Quiz which I was unable to digest was,     What provides guidance to the Development Team on why it is building   the Increment?         The Sprint Backlog    The Product Owner    The Sprint Goal    The Scrum Master      For this I selected the ""The sprint backlog"" as appropriate answer but it turned out wrong. Correct answer is ""The Sprint Goal"" with the explanation as   ""The Sprint Goal is an objective set for the Sprint that can be met through  the implementation of Product Backlog.  It provides guidance to the Development Team on why it  is building the Increment.""   My question over here is what is the difference between Sprint Backlog and Sprint Goal?   I have tried googling around to understand this but I was unable to get to any conclusion. Please suggest! "
1338,Selling agile to stakeHolders hostile to change,Have you ever worked with a stakeholder who revelled in being known as the busiest man in the office? Everything is an elevator pitch? They've seen it all.  How best to pitch the benefit of going agile over waterfall in less than 200 words? 
1339,What possible issues should we think about when going from one to two scrum teams working on a single project?,"Let's say my company has a project, and there's enough work that 10-12 developers are needed, minimum. We want to break up the Scrum team into two separate ones, but this is our first time doing that at this company.   What kinds of things should we consider before trying to do this? Are there any particularly good online resources or books to consult? Mostly everything I've found just suggests Scrum of Scrums and stops there - SoS is clearly required, but what else?  Most information on ""scaling scrum"" or doing ""large scale scrum"" are too big for us - we just want two to three small teams, maybe with a scrum master each, and we'll have to have just the one product owner for the whole project. "
1340,Estimating user stories at the start of the project so that the PM can determine a quote for the client,"Recently I have started to work on a team in a new project. Our company is attempting to run things in an Agile manner.  The project team consists of 4 developers each from different teams and with different business domain knowledge of the new project.  Our first get together involved going through a list of user stories and using Planning poker attempted to give estimates for the stories presented. However I really struggled with this process.    Here for a few things that I struggled with.   A-lot of the stories were UI driven and the complexity of it could depend on the complexity of the UI which we had no idea of. Hence I struggled to estimate appropriately. The PM wanted us to estimate all the stories. However some of the stories had huge unknowns and questions which the PM couldn't answer. Some of the stories involved knowledge about how we were going to implement the system from a code design point of view. We couldn't really agree on anything in particular as it involved some decisions from external people. In our estimates there was no tester involved to add their input.   An example of a couple of the user stories looked like:     As an Account Manager / Field Office I want to to install the   application locally so that I can use it when offline.      As a CRM Administrator I want to be able to store the xml files from   the application into  the company CRM system  so that I can print   branded reports.   Despite all of this, we still went through estimating using relative story points.  The PM was then going to go away and cost up the project and estimate it time wise so she can do a quote for the company requiring the work.  My questions include:   As developers is it our responsibility to ensure we have enough information in order to estimate.  If we have unanswered questions should we push back and require more. Should you estimate all user stories at the start of a project? Given our estimates what is the best way for the PM to determine the hours per point so that she can estimate a total cost?  I believe typically we use the average time from a previous project however this project consists of 4 new developers. Should we do UI mockups and design discussions during this process to help us better estimate?  "

1342,"Is it ok to try do a project ""Agile"" style before attending a formal Agile training?","Is it ok to start following an Agile PM style before we get formal training in it? The other way this question was phrased was is it ok to use tools like Pivotal that is geared for Agile before we even train on Agile formally?  I have heard/seen numerous teams who attempt ""Agile"" but end up falling back to waterfall and that was because the team never strictly followed Agile in the first place.  As a background, we (the senior developers) had decided to take over the PM tasks primarily because the company had decided to do away with the PM/AM role in a project (much controvesy, we aren't happy with it but its something we have to live with). It was usually left on to the client to manage the project their style but we developers found it was disastrous. So we felt we needed to bring back a PM process to keep some standard and sanity.  We have been in Agile-like projects before but never been the ""scrum master"" or the person to manages the whole process. And we have never been formally trained in it - we had normally left the PM to handle the resourcing and feature prioritization while we just handled the actual dev work. "

1347,Earned Schedule results versus Critical Path and Finish Variance results,"I am monitoring a schedule right now for a project that is about 57% complete (duration).  Looking at it at two different perspectives--Earned Schedule and Critical Path--I am finding results that differ quite substantially.  I know no predictive model is 100% valid and no two models will produce the exact same results but I was surprised by the degree of difference.    The schedule is a simple water fall, duration-based schedule that was constructed reasonably well, in that it is a constraint free schedule with no orphaned work packages and most of those work packages are decomposed where no duration is greater than two reporting periods.  The way progress has developed, the remaining work packages are all on the critical path and the schedule is showing a five day unfavorable finish variance.      Using Earned Schedule, the project is showing over 10 business days late, close to 12, and using the estimate at completion formula the project is likely to be over a month late.      Work is probabilistic so I know that the five days late (CP) or the over a month late (ES) are two points within a range of likely results but I am surprised at the size of the variance between two predictions.    Has anyone seen this type of a discrepancy between two models before?  Could this simply be due to the sensitivity of the models and, if so, which model do you believe is more valid / accurate?  Thanks for the help!   "
1348,Assumptions and Constraints and Risk Management,"How do you deal with assumptions and constraints and managing risks?  Do you consider assumptions and constraints risks themselves or drivers of risks or not risks as all?  Why or why not?

1350,"Current best metrics related to requirements, design and architecture","So my boss put forth a 'research and find out question' to me:   Are there ANY (absolutely any, no matter the dumbest, but any) metrics for requirements management? Eg. Requirements completeness, consistency and productivity (being the most difficult to nail down i.e. what is meant by productivity).   Similar question with respect to design and architecture level metrics. I.e., do any exist and what are they if they do.  It's kinda fuzzy right now but I wanted to know what are the metrics that you have commonly used at these stages (if at all) and what have you found to be worthwhile. The notion is that most companies can (and do) come up with proprietary metrics to measure stuff related to the requirements/design/architecture phases but are there any 'commonly applicable' ones?  Note: I'm not looking for code related metrics like cyclomatic complexity or bugs/100 LOC or function points  I'm aware of the product backlog in the agile community along with release burndown release burndown charts tend to give you a good idea of things but they don't work as well in a non-story-point estimation environment, IMO. They are good proxies to measure the aforementioned requirements consistency, completeness and productivity aspects but not sure about how well can they cater to that.  I'm well aware of it being a hard problem, I'm not looking for a solution but mere opinion/view points on what have you used or seen/heard being used in this regard. Research paper references more than welcome too :) "
1351,Planning legacy ERP system replace. WBS?," Our team is in the process of planning legacy ERP replacing project. Unfortunately it is quite custom, so the decision was taken to develop own one.   Legacy system has a lot of inbound integrations (point of sales, backoffice) and outbound (finances, etc.)   While we do understand how to  develop the system, it's quite hard to plan and estimate implementation, integration and deployment phase.  for example: It's very risky to plan go live just over weekend, since it's 24/7 business. Probably we need to have legacy and new systems working in parallel. If so, which one would inbound clients (e.g. mobile apps) connect ?   Does anyone have such kind of experience ? What approach should be used here ? I would be grateful for WBS example.  "
1352,Ratio of learning time and working time at work in software development,"In software development, technology is changing super fast. Therefore, learning new skills and testing new tools are indispensable . If the schedule is tight, developers will not have enough time to learn, then it will affect our company in the long run.

If not lean, is there any other project management method that would help manage this work? "
1359,Can user stories be prioritized using labels applied by the customer?,"So we have a disagreement between our customer and the development team, these are some facts:   We are a software development company (I have a team of 3 devs and 1 QA) Our customer is a startup, that is growing fast, and already making some money We haven't successfully adapted to a workflow, yet   When we began the CTO choose pivotal tracker as our scrum board software, which works fine, however they are constantly adding labels to prioritize the items which I think doesn't make sense under the SCRUM approach where you have a sorting or order in the backlog (and in the current, per pivotal's feature) where, if you need certain story to be addressed or worked on then you need to make sure that is estimated, well defined and you just move it in the backlog to the top, developers then pick up these stories on a LIFO basis.  My motivation to tell the customer that they should not prioritize stories is simple: it is useless. These priorities change all the time, sometimes on every sprint, so the only sane way to keep up would be for them to be re-prioritizing all other stories, not only the new ones which they want to be worked on first, maybe some of the older stories that last week were priority 1 are now priority 2, or even less, plus the constant and ever-changing requirements make this harder, so why bother?  On my opinion this goes against the idea of the backlog and planning of the sprint, but I'm still a rookie on SCRUM so I'm wondering is this kind of prioritization a common practice in the real world? "
1360,"Expectations - In a start-up, what happens when the project is finished?","What kind of future position can a project manager expect in a start-up? Should I expect to be let go once the product is up and running or will I be expected to morph into something else? The partners say ""we can work something out"" so I'd just like to know from people in the field what usually happens. It's my first job as a salaried project manager in a start-up  One big reason I ask this is because I am getting options, which will be vested over 5 years. I think the project as I'm working on it will be completed in 3, so if the job will most likely end, then I need to have the vesting schedule match.  Thanks for your feedback! "
1361,Does SDLC process can be applied to Kanban columns?,"I was a bit confused to determine column on the Kanban. Whether can be determined freely or are there separate rules? can we convert SDLC process to Kanban columns like Waterfall's (Planning, Defining, Designing, Testing, Deploy) to Kanban as a column (Backlog, Defining, Designing, Testing, Deploy)?  I have tried to find some sources but the results are different. David Book said, we need an existing process that can be convert to Kanban process. If it so, then what is the existing process for a new project? "
1362,Iron Triangle / quality triangle - why the middle is said to be non-existant?,"I struggle with some interpretations of the model. Some visualizations says that no projects live in the middle of the triangle. But I wonder why? It would mean that the project is of moderate quality, will be deliver in moderate time and with moderate costs. It would not be efficient as we could possibly do better with focusing on two but why is that considered utopia?  In addition, some say it is about sides, some say it is about vertices. I get that - the closer to the vertex, the better for given constraint. It does not really work with sides.  I think they are probably two views as in some, quality is the area of the triangle. But as shown in the figure here, the point represents the combinations. "

A friend of mine recommended this company called ""Firebrand Training"", who claim that they certify you in Prince2 in just 3 days! What do you reckon? Too good to be true? Will it be a ""brain dump"" or can it be done? They do guarantee that we pass the exam, but I just wanted someone else's opinion if they've been on a course with them.  Thanks, Gary "
1366,Deal with unestimated Defect-Tasks in Sprint for Veloctity calculation,"As said many times before (1, 2, 3):      ""Do not estimate bugs / defects"".   I know in Scrum we try to minimize the defect rate, but it happens now and then. Fixing such unestimated tasks might have big effects on the actual velocity of the team. I wonder if there is some kind of proceeding or formula to make this visible to the team and to others?  Or is it just, that an increase of defect rate (= drop of velocity) is a sign we should pay more attention to our QA?  As we do not estimate Bugs, this one is not a duplicate of that question: Tracking points spent on bugs during sprint "
1367,Parallel Sprints Use case,"Why do we need Parallel Sprints? I am trying to understand the use case here.  Consider our Use case   We have two developers and two testers on our scrum team We have four developers joining the team (but they are not dedicated team members) Our sprint cycle is 2 weeks   Do you recommend parallel sprints for this scenario? The team is thinking to have sprint 1 and sprint 2 (with four developers) start on the same date, but sprint 2 to have 3 weeks cycle to accommodate the testing. "
1368,What to do when running into a potential rabbit hole in a story?,"Say I have a team member who is working on a story. While working on that story, s/he runs into an issue that could or could not be crucial to the completion of that original story.  Should the team member:  a) Go down the ""rabbit hole"" and see if s/he could solve the issue.  b) Write up another ticket for the issue and place it into the current sprint and start working on it.  c) Write up a ticket and pass over it for now, and see how long it can be swept under the rug during this sprint.  I'm leaning toward option C as it allows the developer to keep working toward the completion of the feature. But it still reports the issue.   Any thoughts? Which option would you advise, and why? "
1369,Doubt defining functional requirements,"I'm trying to derive the functional requirements from a use case but I'm with some doubts.  The use case is about create a new post and it is presented below. For example looking to the pre-conditions one functional requirement could be:     When a user submit his credentials and they are valid, the system   shall initiate the session of this user   It is correct? I read that a functional requirement can be written in the user or system perspective. In the case above it is in the system perspective, in the user or both? Because it has ""when a user..."" and then ""the system shall..."".  And for example in the step number 1 of the main flow what could be a functional requirement for this? I write this 2 options below but I don't know if it is correct, because I don't know if it should be written in the user or system perspective. For example in the user perspective:     The admin shall be able to fill and submit the information relative to   a post.   Or in the system perspective:     When an admin fill and submits the post information, the system should   store in the database that information.   Can you help understand better how to define the functional requirements properly in the example?  The use case is this:     Title: Create Post      Ator: Administrator      Pre-conditions: The administrator has a session initiated in the system.       Trigger: The administrator indicates that he wants to create an event.      Main flow:      1- The admin fill the information relative to title and message      2- The system presents a preview of the post in the page      3 - The admin submits the filled information, and the admin can just   save the post information or publish the post      4- The system validates the information inserted by the admin      5- If the admin just save the post the system saves the inserted   information in the db and informs the user that the post was saved. If   the admin publish the post, the system saves the inserted information   in the db,publish the event, and informs the user that the post was   publish.      6- The system redirects the admin to the admin page.      Alternative flow: Invalid Data      1- The system presents a message to inform the admin that exist fields   that were filled in a incorrect way      2- The admin corrects the fields      3- The flux continues in the step 3 of the main flow.      Post-condition: Post registered in the system.  "

1371,How to implement TFB / NFC / 1 (Sprint) estimation technique?,"Reading some old posts like this one, I noticed that the TFB / NFC / 1 (Sprint) estimation technique could be useful for teams moving towards agility.  Happens that I failed to find over the internet how to implement it besides this, which is pretty vague.  Question: when defining what's the 1, I see two approaches:   during Sprint planning, the development team will start from the top of the product backlog, reviewing the stories available and start adding them to the iteration up to the moment they believe they reached 1... and ""skipping"" the items that are either TFB / NFC for the next cycle of refinement? Or  during Sprint planning, the refinement is done up to the moment the 1 contains also refined items from TFB / NFC?   Another way of seeing this question is when the TFB / NFC items are refined? During sprint planning or refinement?    Offtopic: One of the first entries I got when Googling this is a tweet from a pm.se member that I haven't seen in a while... Pawel Brodzinski! "
1372,How to communicate about work with a team member living through a family tragedy?,"I have a student assistant, who only works 10 hours a weak, mostly from home. She only comes to my office when there is something we need to discuss. Her contract specify the amount of work hours, and we track it.   When she was here last time, she got a message. Her grandmother lay in dying. She was so distressed, I just sent her home to call her family. The next day, she sent me an e-mail. She had flown to her family, and wouldn't come back before the end of the week. As she has exams the next two weeks, she won't be able to work before the 26. this month. She promised to eliminate the resulting hour debt next month.   What she probably forgot is that I am going on vacation and after that on conference, starting on the 29, and will be away for a whole month. So not only will it be hard for her to work enough next month as she would soon hit a point where she won't be able to proceed without me, we'd need to meet before I go, so I can give her as much work as possible to work on. I understand her decision and feel for her loss, but I still have to communicate with her now in order to arrange a meeting for this short time window between the 26. and 29. I can't leave it out and expect that she will just come to my office when she is back, because this is not how we work. And I find it very hard to do write it.   First, it has to be an e-mail. With her away, I have no other means to contact her. This is already unpleasantly impersonal. But second, it just feels awful. She is home, waiting for her grandmother's death or maybe already mourning, and probably feeling guilty for abruptly leaving her work and collecting a debt in work hours, and then comes an e-mail from me arranging a meeting. I just don't know how to write it without appearing cold-hearted. Any ideas what I could do to avoid it?   And third, I don't even know what social conventions to follow. Of course, I would want to include some supportive words to show her that I care and understand. If she had had a message about the grandmother's death, I could have sent her my condolences. But this would probably be terrible if the old lady is still alive, in a critical condition. On the other hand, a wish for speedy recovery also sounds terribly mocking. I can't find a way to formulate it.   I am very inexperienced in such a situation. Not only is this the first time I am managing somebody, I have also never lived through a death within my closer relations, and neither have I been part of a team with a co-worker losing a relative. How should I handle the situation now?  "
1373,How can these problems with agile be solved?,"I'm a lead developer and for the last four years I've owned a code base which has steadily been improving in quality.  I worked at a fairly small company and we previously worked in small waterfall cycles.  Typically we'd do a release of our software every 3->5 months.  We didn't use many formal project management methods but we had a good team and everybody was intensely collaborative.  I spent the vast majority of my time writing features, fixing bugs and improving the code base as I saw fit.  I refactored code when I thought we were starting to see too many bugs in that area and I focused on trying to make our code unit testable and of high quality.  QA would pick up our work once features became dev complete but we didn't work in sprints.  It's fair to say that things didn't always go smoothly and we did have some quality problems but productivity was very high.  Fast forward to now..  We've been bought by larger company who have already fully adopted agile methodologies.  We've had to adopt their processes and some in our team were very keen to move to full agile.  Initially, for a period of about 2/3 months our work ground to a halt.     Decisions that were previously made quickly and efficiently, ad-hoc, by groups of interested individuals became part of the grooming process and we found that design by committee took forever compared to what we did before.  A great deal of our time was taken up by grooming and planning meetings and at one point I realized that more than 50% of my time was now used for meetings.   Over time, during our retrospectives we've improved this process.  One of the things we did was to get individual team members to pre-groom PBIs so that some of the thinking had been done in advance and we didn't have to spend quite so much time just thrashing out the basics of each item during the meetings.  However, some problems still remain..  Here are the big ones for me:   Generalization and group think has reduced the extent to which anyone ""owns"" the code base.  This has been really bad and it feels to me like the code base has been left to rot.  Nobody can do anything of any significance to it without a massive discussion first and all those little tasks that used to just happen for free no longer happen.  Instead specialists who used to do this stuff are busy doing other things which are the sprint priority even though they do them very slowly.  There's basically no time left to put serious thought into our code.  Over the longer term I think we'll pay a big price for this. Developer passion has gone..  Nobody wants to spend so much time in meetings and all the decision making power has evaporated leaving the devs demotivated.  Decisions about what development tasks should be undertaken are now often taken by testers or others who don't actually understand the code and so now everybody just drudges on not really enjoying their work like they used to. Generalization is wasting our time and damaging our code.  Right now I'm trying to learn a new programming language to fix one bug and bugs that I could be fixing in a language I know are being fixed by another scrum team by a guy who I don't think knows the code in that area well enough to be able to efficiently or effectively fix it.  This kind of thing has already caused us some quality problems.   So, how can we fix this within Scrum?  We can't get rid of the process, but can we change it somehow so that we can work effectively again? "
1374,How is the management external to the Scrum Team involved in the Daily Scrum?,I had a question during PSM1 assessment:      How is the management external to the Scrum Team involved in the Daily Scrum?    The Scrum Master speaks on their behalf Management gives an update at the start of each daily scrum. The development team self-manages and is the - only management required at the Daily scrum. The product owner represents their opinions.   Can anyone suggest me proper answer out of given options?  My choice is: The development team self-manages and is the - only management required at the Daily scrum - As per my knowledge Daily Scrum is belongs to development team only and they are responsible and accountable. But not sure I'm correct. 
1375,How to split Requirement into Userstories,"My team is currently working on defining user stories with the product owner.  He supplied us with a story that is on one hand quite complex, on the other hand he says, that no part of it is independently of value.  I would like some hint on how to do this in scrum:  Our field is a register for last wills, the users are people who search for and handle last wills for deceased citizens.  Our stories now are:  Story 1:  A User wants to enter Filter criteria to get at max 100 results from the Database at once. (business process = ""send inquiry"")  Acceptance criteria:  results are digitally signed according to law xY max 100 rows at once a button for ""the next 100"" last Name, given Name, as possible filter criteria  And then there is a second story:  Story 2:  An Auditor wants to review all ""inquiries"" sent by a defined user, to see if he entered legally correct filters, see what results were provided at the time of the inquiry,  and see if the user handled all results properly (legally).  Acceptance criteria:  results are digitally signed according to law xY Story 1 criteria as possible filter criteria ( action would be: ""give me all inquiries where the user filtered for ""given Name""=""Bob"""") show the same results as the user saw at that time results never change  SO if my team now decided to tackle Story 1 now, but Story 2 on a seperate sprint:  How I have to handle these ""inquiries""in Story 2  obviously influences the implementation of Story 1.  It is even legally not allowed to deliver a final product with story 1 but not story 2 (these reviews are mandatory once a year for each user)  Are these one story? Does scrum encourage just implementing Story 1 with no regards to story 2 and possible having to rework Story 1's result to enable Story 2?  Do I add ""inquires have to be stored with filters and results"" as an acceptance criterion to Story 1 and reference Story 2 (that would break the ""independent"" requirement of the INVEST principle)?   My main question is:   If two stories have potential(or are sure to) to influence each other, but cannot be completed in the same sprint, do I:   disregard the second story's influence (need to redo work, but decide as late as possible) merge the stories (make it more complex, but delivering the full business value of the features) Plan the influence into the implementation (no need to refactor - possible time saved later, but no longer independent stories, working against the ""embrace change, decide late"" principle)    All courses i took and free videos I watched, papers I've read did not give me a satisfying answer, I really need your help here.  Thank you in advance! "
1376,What does a QA team do during the development phase of a sprint in Agile Scrum?,"I understand that, in theory, QA should be working with dev ""collaborating"" right from the day 1 of a sprint. But how does it actually work in real life? Let me present two scenarios -  Scenario 1 where a story requires 3 days of development - Let's say it's a complicated report with time consuming database setup and domain logic etc and takes 3 days to code. Since the dev can't deliver anything meaningful to test before 3 days and assuming it takes only 4 hours to write all relevant test cases, what is QA expected to do until the report is ready for testing?   Scenario 2 where stories are tiny enough to be completed in hours - Let's consider a login/registration screen. There can be tiny stories for user being able to login, user being able to register, forgot password functionality etc. A dev can complete each one of these stories in hours and pass on to QA and move on to the next story but the next story might break the previous ones. For example, if dev finishes up login functionality and QA starts testing it and then dev starts working on forgot password functionality, it might the break login in unexpected ways because the functionalities are indeed related. If QA waits for all of the related stories to be completed then we end up with scenario 1 above.  In a perfect world, QA can be expected to do nothing if there is indeed nothing to do and accept it as part of the cost. But in a real world, PMO and other groups keeping track of resource utilization will certainly point it out as poor project management and worse. So, how does it all work in real life scenarios? How best to apply Scrum in these types of scenarios?  "
1377,A Scrum Master is working with a Development Team that has members in different physical locations,"I had a question during PSM1 assessment:     A Scrum Master is working with a Development Team that has members in different physical locations. The Development Team meets in a variety of meeting rooms arid has much to do logistically (for example, set up conference calls) before the Daily Scrum. What action should the Scrum Master take?    Allow the Development Team to self-manage and determine for itself what to-do. Set up the meeting and tell the Development Team that is how it will be done. Ask the Development Team members to alternate who is responsible for meeting setup. inform management and ask them to solve it.   Can anyone suggest me proper answer out of given options?  My choice is: inform management and ask them to solve it. - As per my knowledge Scrum Master is responsible for resolution to any impediments to the development team.  But as per scrum development team is self-organizing team so other possible answer can be Allow the Development Team to self-manage and determine for itself what to-do.  Not sure I'm correct. "
1378,What is the best requirements format for tenders,"Large organisations often ousource software projects. For this purpose they create tender documents, which are used by software companies to make a bid.  Tender documents must specify requirements so that interested companies can estimate the effort needed. What is the best format for these requirements ? Use cases, user stories, traditional functional requirements, high level features ?  If you write detailed uses cases, you will need a lot of work up-front, and you have the risk of missing details that will be charged additionally once they are found by the contractor.  If you write high level features, the estimates done by the software companies will not be accurate, and you have the risk the company will underestimate a complicated software project.  What are your thoughts and experiences on this issue ?  Thank you in advance. "

1380,Kanban - Simple Backlog Forecasting?,"Does anyone know if it's possible with Jira to cover the following scenario?   The team estimates the items in its backlog in story points The backlog is prioritized The backlog is handled like a Fifo queue; the team works on the highest items first The team has a known velocity, predicted by the last days' weather method   Because every item is estimated and velocity and priority are known, I'd be able to show the estimated time when an item is finished. The calculation could be updated dynamically, for example when someone reprioritizes an item or something gets finished.  The easiest solution I can think of is to simply add another field to each item which is then shown in the Kanban view. Has anyone experience with something like this? "
1381,How do I advise someone creating a programming language and user/developer community?,"Friends of mine want to take their in-house programming language and take it into the open source arena.   There are many challenges, one of which is how to begin to create a community of users. Where does one start?  The original was written, as I understand it, in VB6 (with components written in Ada, Perl, assembler, Fortran etc.) There are discussions about what to write the new version in: C#, D, Go ... and the list goes on.   Also there are discussions about whether to stick to the Windows platform or go cross-platform. Huge questions and not many good answers.  And they worry too about having someone fork the repository and develop a competing and perhaps more successful version. Perhaps they need to find a benevolent dictator. Are there other means of keeping a name with one version and not letting it drift to others?  The biggest challenge is the business plan: how do you monetize a programming language community?   P.S. Is this the right place to ask these questions? "
1382,Selecting user stories during sprint planning,"When selecting user stories from the prioritized product backlog during sprint planning, is it more important to make sure that we end up with our predicted velocity in story points or that we choose the most important user stories?  Consider the following example:  The team feels comfortable committing to 9 story points this iteration. These are the stories at the top of our product backlog (from most important to least important)   User Story A - 4 story points User Story B - 2 story points User Story C - 1 story point User Story D - 3 story points   Is it better to choose A, B and C (7 story points, based on priority) or should we choose A, B and D (9 story points, based on predicted velocity)? "
1383,How to refer to functional requirement specifications (FRS) from user stories?,"Let's consider a simple story for a user authentication screen:     As a user,   I want to be able to login with my username and password   so that I can do xyz.   This looks good, but all of the details related to what should happen when the password is incorrect, how many retries should be allowed, validations, and a bunch of other stuff that should go in with that story are missing.  Where should all that information go in an agile Scrum setup? Is it an FRS (or any other equivalent monolithic document containing details of all functional specs)? If yes, given there will be hundreds or thousands of these tiny stories, how should references to their corresponding FRS sections kept in sync with each other? How best to manage this level of detail in an agile Scrum world? "
1384,Deriving functional requirements from use case,"Im deriving the functional requirements from a Edit User Account use case but I dont know if Im doing this corretly.  The use case is this:     Title: Edit user account      Pre-conditions: The admin is authenticated.       Trigger: The user wants to edit his account.      Ator: User      Main flow:      1- The system presents the saved user account data to the user.      2- The user updates the data he wants.      3- The system validates the form.      4- The system informs the user that the information was updated with   success.      5- The admin chooses a list option      Post-condition:      Alternative Scenarios:      Empty fields      1- The system presents a message informing the user that he must fill   all mandatory fields.      2- The flow continues on step 2 of the main flow.      Invalid Email      1- The system presents a message informing the user that the email has   a invalid fomat.      2 - The flow continues on step 2 of the main flow.      Post-condition:      User account edited.   The functional requirements Im getting from this use case are:   The system must allow the user updates his user account. The system must ensure that the user fill are mandatory fields to update his user account. The system must ensure that the user insert a valid email to update his user account. The system must ensure that the password has at least 6 characters long for the user update his user account. the system must alert the user when he tries to save is account information inserting an email in a invalid format. the system must alert the user when he tries to save is account information and dont fill are mandatory fields. the system must inform the user that his account information was updated with  success if he submits the form with success. The system must inform the user that the password must be 6 characters long if he inserts a password with less than 6 characters.   Doubts:  Do you think this can be a way of writing functional requirements? Im with some doubts about how to write them. For example:  1- The first requirement is a functional requirement? Because it seems an obvious requirement but maybe its a functional requirement because its testable. We can test if the system allow the user to update his account right? So it should be a functional requirement.  2 - The second requirement we should specify what are the mandtory fields? For example email, etc? "
1385,What can be done about a task with a tight deadline and no analysis?,I am a software engineer. Today in the middle of a Sprint I was told to drop all my activities and start doing another task whose Jira entry has like 3 words.  The deadline for this task is very tight and they're all telling me to complete it as soon as possible. But I am on this project only 3 days and I have no idea what I'm supposed to do with this task at all. I don't know the architecture or the code of this project.  What course of action should I take here? It certainly doesn't feel pleasant to work like this. Is this normal in scrum?  I work for an outsourcing company and I feel like I can't voice this as a concern during our stand up meetings because I will be told by my manager that it's an internal issue and that we shouldn't talk about it when our client is there.  
1386,This use case can be considered a functional requirement?,"For example, for a site like Ebay we can identify these requirements:   Search Products Add product to cart Buy product Add to favorite Edit user account Add comment Remove comment Close session in the system Start session in the system   Are the requirements above considered functional?  If they not, then if we add to each one of these requirements a use case, can the use cases that describe each one of these requirements be considered functional requirements?  For example, for the edit user account requirement, the use case is:     Title: Edit user account      Pre-conditions: The admin is authenticated.       Trigger: The user wants to edit his account.

1387,What are the different approaches and how frequent to prioritize the backlog?,"What are different aspects of a PBIs (Product Backlog Items), or generally speaking features, would you take into consideration for prioritizing the backlog? risk, ROI, time to market, cost of delay, at PO's discretion, etc.   Would you consider a combination or even a weighted combination of those to prioritize the backlog?   How often is necessary to revisit the prioritization? At every sprint? on a daily basis? or at PO's discretion? "

1389,How to set dependencies in TeamWork app to cascade delays in one task into dates of other tasks?,"Let's say I have multiple tasks that are supposed to be taken care of one after another. Each has its own date of completion.   task 1 - will be completed on 15 march (1 day) task 2 - will be completed on 17 march (2 days) task 3 - will be completed on 18 march (1 day) task 4 - will be completed on 21 march (3 day)   Suddenly task 2 is delayed by two days. I would like task 3 and task 4's dates be changed accordingly.  Right now I use teamwork. In calendar view, tasks are NOT connected to each other in any way. So if the date of one task changes, the rest stay the same. I need to manually move all tasks on the calendar.  Can such problem be taken care of in teamwork? "
1390,How to ensure sprint tasks are bug free before release,"I was asked this question in an interview, and couldn't figure out the solution, so I thought I will come here.   Basically, I was mostly working as a developer, and had my own set of unit tests for the tasks I was finishing. But if I was a product owner or scrum master, then how will I ensure that development team has created enough unit tests, or tested the code properly?  I think we can have acceptance testing, or even consider the bugs as part of next sprint. There is another option of having product owner and scrum master create a set of basic tests during sprint meetings. But that will cause the sprint meeting to run for hours. These are the two possible ideas that I could suggest.   Is there any other way, a product owner can ensure the quality? "
1391,Similarities / Differences between BPM and software projects,"I have begun working for a company that resell BPM products, for improvement and automation, including small Sw development sometimes.  Sadly, they have a colosal rate of failure when estimating time and other resources. I have been asked to provide ideas from my agile/waterfall developer experiences, but I do realize this is not a sw project entirely.  I find that processes are design/maintenance heavy, and that have more people involved, sometimes unwilling to review/help on their own process automation.  I have seen handy practices from Sw projects to be present in BPM tools (versioning, project descriptors), but that's pretty much it.  This makes me wonder, could they have metrics in common? Or even a methodology? Or are they 2 different worlds? "
1392,"Parallel workflows: Preparation at a low-level, while management sorts things out at a high-level","Introduction:  My organization is embarking on a corporate asset management project. The corporation knows that it needs to do comprehensive asset management on all its assets, in a single, easy-to-use data location. The idea is that asset-inventory data from several specialized systems will be periodically exported &amp; imported to a single location, for the purpose of organization-wide analysis and reporting.   The Situation - High-level:  Management is currently in the process of figuring out:   What they want How they want it Why they want it   They're doing what they refer to as ""starting with the end in mind"". While I wouldn't say they are employing any sort of project management practices, they are trying to 'figure their poop out' at a high-level. This makes good-enough sense to me.   (This is a bureaucratic organization; it will take 1-3 years for this planning to be completed.)  The Situation - Low-level:  Down at the worker-bee level, a few of us are working on 'getting the organization's poop together'. In other words, we're preparing. We know that the details of the project are subject to change; heck, they haven't even been defined yet. But we have a general idea of where it's going, and we know that our data needs a lot of work to get there. And we know that we should start thinking about the framework that will be needed for this initiative.   The Question:  We generally have the support of our immediate management. They know that being prepared is smart, and we've been successful doing things this way in the past. But we face fierce criticism from other stakeholders. They accuse us of putting the 'carriage before the horse', and think that the details(data) will just work themselves out, when the time comes.  It's not that we think that they're 100% wrong (there is some sense to what they're saying), nor are we looking for help to argue with them. However, we would like to make some sense of this sort of parallel-workflow that's we've come up with, so that we can refine it and communicate it better.   It could be visualized something like this:  Project Planning             Project is underway          Project Complete ----&gt;----&gt;----&gt;----&gt;----&gt;----&gt;----&gt;----&gt;----&gt;----&gt;----&gt;----&gt;----&gt;----&gt;----|                              ^ Preparation                  |   ----&gt;----&gt;----&gt;----&gt;----&gt;-----                               \                                Implement! Hit the ground running.   So the question is:  Does this fit any sort of project management technique? How would it be described? "
1393,Necessity to micro manage off shore developers,"In a large organization, every morning a manager from the HQ office has a meeting with the dev team(s) based offshore (India) and checks the work they've done. He's very tech savvy, and says that he can tell whether they're taking the piss or are honest with him always. He's able to dig in the problems and resolve them, and also provide solutions. Some might say that he's doing a great job in scrutinizing their work, especially given that these teams are responsible for millions of revenue to the company.  This organization wants to move towards more agile ways of working. Is the above suitable to keep or should it be phased out, therefore moving the responsibility closer to the dev team? Is this an issue of trust? What questions would you ask to start changing this approach? "
1394,When to process feedback on the deliverable of the last iteration?,"My team and I are working with iterations of two weeks (trying to use our own version of Scrum) and we try to deliver a new version after every iteration.   After an iteration we let the stakeholders test our new version on a staging environment and they send us feedback. This feedback will be processed and the smoothed version will be deployed to production after we get an OK from all stakeholders.  This way of working is working fine sometimes, but in some iterations we are experiencing problems plannings wise. At the start of our next iteration, it is still unclear how many feedback we will get on our deliverable, so we can't really estimate the time needed to process the feedback in our iteration.  Can someone give us some tips about how to incorporate a correct feedback loop inside or workflow? Maybe we can deliver the deliverable two days before the end of our sprint, so we know how many feedback we have on the moment we start our sprint? I also thought about a workflow in which we let the stakeholders test the features during the sprint, so we can process the feedback in the same iteration we developed the feature. "

Original question:  I'm having trouble understanding how to solve a question on completing a PERT chart.  In the question below, how do I decide which of the arrows coming from milestone 2 should be labeled with B and which with C please?   "
1397,When is a Scrum Master superfluous?,"By the time a Dev-Team knows about the agile process and is able to defend it against outside influences, one might say the Scrum Master's work is done at this point and he/she is not needed anymore.  It seems this might be a very individual state (depending from team to team). I wonder if there are objective signs, when the Scrum Master becomes superfluous? Or mabye this state is never really reached and the Scrum Master always has some work to do? "
1398,How to finance non-programming activities when clients don't want to pay for these activities?,"On one hand, software development involves a lot of non-programming activities like requirements gathering (including analysis), estimating, planning, testing, tracking work, change request management, and more.  On the other hand, our clients don't want to pay for these activities. When a non-programming activity shows up on their invoices, they usually get angry and complain to upper-management. Of course, they always win their cause. Therefore, we (the company) don't get paid.  The result of all this is that upper management is pressuring us (programmers and project managers) to not perform any of these non-programming activities. It generates all the problems that are commonly known to result for having a ""code &amp; fix"" approach to software development.  Our poorly tested software is often released with bugs, and of course, clients don't want to pay for us fixing them. Moreover, we often release, just in time, software that don't correspond to what the client's wanted or needed because we never had the chance to invest the time to understand what the client needed. The release is therefore rejected by the client who then complains to upper managment. We then have to make all the requested changes for free.  I don't know how other companies solve this problem and I don't know where to look at to get the answer. Do they bill their clients for non-programming activities? More importantly, how do they get to finance these non-programming activities? Do they convince their clients to pay for these activities? Do they hide instead, unlike us, the real nature of the work they are doing? Do they charge so high for programming activities that it doesn't matter if non-programming activities don't generate any income? How?  I expect agile to be suggested as an answer, but please understand that I will not accept ""you must do agile"" as an answer, because it would not explain how agile would solve the problem. In a scrum team, for example, you perform a lot of non-programming activies and you still get paid for them. I cannot begin to imagine how our clients will ever accept to pay us for doing sprint retrospectives for example. If you want to answer ""agile"", please explain how agile solves the problem. For example, how do you finance all the non-programming activites happening during the scrum process? "
1399,How should be best discussed bug between team/scrum master/PO,"Edit: Definition of ""bug"". Here I describe as bug a bug introduced during development or missing/incorrect implementation of a story found after acceptance of the story. Our team does not face ""production bug"" reported by users.  At work we often have the following situation:   Team member find a bug Bug is forwarded to PO and Scrum master PO set up a meeting with scrum master, team member who found the bug, themselves (and some times more team member) A long discussion ensue to discuss what happened, what should have happened, is it a bug, how to fix it, when to fix it.   The problem I see is that too many people are put in a meeting to discuss too many details.  What I think would be better:   Team member find a bug Team member try to reproduce the bug and details how to reproduce it. Team member discuss with other team member/scrum master how to fix the bug. Scum master discuss with PO when to fix the bug.   Is the current situation good or could be improved? Is my solution a correct solution? "
1400,Microsoft Project as collaboration tool,"I want to create a project management and collaboration tool for a small company. I need a strong integration with Exchange, Active Directory, and to be prepared for a future integration with Dynamics and Sharepoint.  We already own all the Office 2016 suite, so my first choice would naturally be Microsoft Project, attached to a MS Project Server. NOT Office 365.  Is Ms Project a collaboration tool that allows to manage a complete workflow of a project in a modern way (assign tasks, schedule them, attach files to a project, chat with users, comment tasks, and so on)? Would it give full access to the project tools also via web browsers, for Mac users?  Thank you "
1401,How do you evaluate a Project Manager's communications skills?,"Having great communication skills is widely acknowledged as a must-have for any aspiring or seasoned Project Manager, and communications regularly cited as a key success (or failure) factor in projects. I don't recall ever seeing a job advert for a PM that didn't include ""outstanding/exceptional/advanced commnunications skills"" or a PM candidate who didn't claim they had them. I personnally embrace the idea that the ability of a PM to communicate well can make or break a project.  But in practice, how do you evaluate a Project Manager's communications skills? What sort of tangible evidence do you look for?  EDIT - To clarify the question: the need to evaluate a PM's communications skills pertains to both interviews and individual performance management. "
1402,User Story breakdown - Technical Task + User Feature,"My team is building a web application that has the following high-level user story:     As a user, I would like the ability to bulk exclude components from a   given country.   The work breaks down into two distinct tasks.     Create the web application feature that excludes components by country.   Fetch component - country association data on a daily basis   At first, I started to break this down into two user stories.  However, the second task doesn't really fit into a typical user story format. I started writing something like  this:     As the system, I will parse country data from the XYZ feed.   On one hand, this task is not user-centric. On the other hand, the ability to fetch component - country data is a well defined, vertically sliced task that is independently verifiable.  What is the proper user story breakdown for this type of scenario? Is it improper to have a system focused user story? "
1403,Distributed Risk Register and Facilitation of Risk-Based / -Aware Thinking,"Over here, it was aksed how to overcome reticence to use RAID logs (with A referring to actions, not assumptions). The general approach, already suggested by the OP, would be to rid the (in this case agile) team of the docuemnt formats and aspects which don't fit into their world, and let the PM take care of the coordination between the two worlds of different mindsets and docuemnts to be maintained.  In this answer to the above question, it was suggested to keep the PM's Risk Register short and have the agile team maintain their own, with them either finding the document useful and maintaining it by themselves, or being encouraged to do so:     Your logs should contain only your top five or six items. Maybe seven. These are the highest priority items that you need to track, the most expensive, the most impactful. The rest fall off and are delegated to the teams, who themselves likely maintain their own logs...or should be encouraged to do so. By doing so, the logs remain truly relevant and important and even a SCRUM team will look at them and find them useful, I suspect.   In my view, this suggesting triggers the following questions:   What are your experiences with a distributed Risk Register regarding a) maintenance, b) presentation, c) when the event materialises? How do you deal with a culture of non-risk-based thinking and widely accepted excuses to remain in that comfort zone a) in general and b) in particular when the team is supposed to maintain its own risk register?  "
1404,Should the Product Owner dictate what info the UI needs to display?,"I hope someone can help me understand one part of the role of the Product Owner (PO).  In my company, we have a PO that is responsible for the Product Backlogs of all our products. I work as a UX designer. The PO specifies features and requirements to the Teams.  Very often, the PO suggests, in detail, how a user interface of our software should be, such as what type of information is to be displayed in the user interface (e.g. ""I'd like to see a date in list"" or ""I'd like to see so and so in this view""). Often the PO has asked the customer, or knows already, but the product UI ends up being quite cluttered and complex.  I am now introducing user testing to encourage user-centered design and advocate making better design decisions based on user involvement.  My question is: to what extent should the PO describe the requirements of a UI? Should we (the developers and designers) look to the PO to decide and say what the information in the UI should be? "
1405,What is the difference between ABCD analysis and Eisenhower method?,"According to Wikipedia, the ABCD analysis is:     Activities are ranked by these general criteria:         A – Tasks that are perceived as being urgent and important,   B – Tasks that are important but not urgent,   C – Tasks that are unimportant but urgent,     D - Tasks that are unimportant and not urgent.      How is this different to the Eisenhower method? I think it's just a different name? Yet they are listed differently in the page. "
1406,Best (most agile) way to develop multiple products concurrently,"I would like to restructure my development teams so that they can work in a more agile way, however each of those teams needs to develop changes for multiple products in their business area.  I've seen many comments on here on how that is an ""anti-scrum"" pattern, which is fine except the solution appears to be hiring 50+ developers so I can have a team per product.  So, how do I organise 5 teams of 4 to work on roughly 5 products each team.  Planning is not the issue, its how to put multiple products into a backlog and plan sprints.  Currently I am running with 1 dev on one product for 1 sprint.  That could mean 2 devs both working on the same product for 1 sprint, and the other working on another product.  This works when there is a sprints worth of velocity, but when that comes in at less than a sprint, how best to manage this?  Is it better to put everything into one backlog for all products and then pick them off in a more kanban way? "
1407,"Boss came and said ""The system is broken"". Would this be a project?","I am preparing for the CAPM exam and following Rita's book.  But I couldn't figure out whether or not the above would be considered a Project.  It is also written:     Of the thousands of students RMC has taught, very few came into our classes understanding that you must first take what you are given and organize the work into appropriate projects. The project planning process will produce schedules and budgets. Can you schedule ""fix it"" if you do not know what is wrong? Of course not, so there are at least two projects in the previous story.   Why would there would be two projects? "

1413,"Requirements Tracking in Jira for ""Preliminary Project Assessment""","Recently our company has taken the plunge into using Atlassian for our project management tool. Right now we're using Jira and Confluence. As an architect at our company, one of the things I've begun to maintain is something we call a ""Preliminary Project Assessment."" This includes very high level project components, risks, assessments, notes, things we will be ignoring for this project and estimates. Specifically, the components are technically formed chunks of work. For example, a component would be ""create new mobile application.""  Once the scrum teams kick off, they're working off the user stories and breaking them off into tasks. What I'd love to have is a nice way to map the user story back to the larger components they effect. Hopefully this will not only help me with traceability, but will also help the team easily get back to my initial thoughts on the piece.  Today we've got all of our users stories and sprints captured in Jira but this document in box. Before I go through and start adding super terse comments into each story, does anyone else have a thought on how I can use the Atlassian suite of products to help achieve what I'm looking for? Above and beyond that, does anyone have experience adding traceability from initial project planning down to the tasks the team executes on? "
1414,"How much overhead for code-review , test driven development , refactoring","If i work in a software team which is typically driven by delivery, and if we want to study the introduction of peer review, test driven development and refactoring, how much time delay can be expected in a typical delivery cycle ? Would it be 30% slower, costlier ? Would it reduce over time ?  I find that most managers want to introduce these but are under time and cost crunch and so do not introduce them.   Thanks. "
1415,How can a team member moderate a retrospective?,"In my organization, we decided to hold retrospectives. To be honest, this was a move facilitated by me, because I felt that we should improve our teamwork after a rise from two members in one office to four members in adjacent offices.  We have one person for support and everything non-code related, two designated programmers of which I am one and our sponsor who also codes and created the framework.  Can we hold a retrospective with one team member/sponsor being the moderator at all, and how would that work?  I ask, because I tried to moderate and found it increasingly difficult to position myself outside the team for these reasons:   I want to participate actively. My personal experience as a team member would be helpful. As a team member I am not external and always involved, while trying the opposite feels artificial.   Any ideas? "
1416,What is a “battery”?,"I was very surprised to read, in this question, the mention of “batteries” as a PM tool, seemingly linked to Scrum. The OP talks about an article about their use, but none of my desperate Googling efforts helped.  So, since other people seemed to have no trouble with the term, I hope those same can now explain&nbsp;&nbsp;:)  What is a battery in the context of PM? Within which methodology is it used / usable?  And, if applicable: what are their pros and cons?  Reference articles would be greatly appreciated too&nbsp;&nbsp;:)    Just for reference, the relevant part of the cited post:     We were handling [live issues] by batteries inside sprint. But I recently read article against using batteries and many points from it are true. Like:         Battery is always used fully sometimes for other things not releated   This influence on our velocity     "

1418,Implementing scrum inside a real-world matrix organized software department,"I'm working as a manager of the software department in our small sized company (~50 people). I have three development teams, 3-4 members in each. One of the members in each team is in the role of the team leader. One of the teams is mainly working an a single project and it happens rarely what they have to help out somewhere else.  The other two teams work on 2-3 projects (same for both teams).    My predecessor used no scrum or such, basically he just assigned work very loosely in a daily to weekly rhythm. Of course that lead to the absence of any project planning/controlling artifacts or processes. Nobody ever knew that could happen in the next time and nobody could predict when any task will be completed. You can imagine how the projects run.    I'll have the task to move on from here and I decided to start implementing scrum into the teams. Of course I'm still very unsure about some things and I'm in need for some advice from people which traveled a similarly road much farther yet.  The roles:   We have custom driven project with classic project managers and project engineers. Since they act already like product owners, I think best would be to keep that. Would you agree? We have also some intern R&amp;D like projects to improve our products or dev tools on our own. All kind of people can propose or push-start such projects. I usually manage them from start to end. I would be in the role of the product owner for them. Do you do the same? Management of the collaboration and control of the different Teams. That is one of the main things the company does pay me for. I think of implementing a thing like scrum of scrums between me and the team leaders. I would be in the role of the scrum master here, which may or may not bite with the product owner role described above. Would you recommend it to me?   The procedures and artifacts: I want to start slowly, making sure everyone is following on our path.   The things I want to begin with is maintenance of release- and sprint-backlogs capturing user stories, sprint planning with cutting the stories into tasks and maintaining task boards, and daily stand ups. If that works I would go on introducing estimations, burn down charts, measurement of development velocity. Afterwards maybe measuring developers individual estimation optimistic-factors to improve project finishing forecasts. Would you agree to that sequence or do something else? The thing causing me the most head aches for now is how to do all that while working on different projects at the same time inside a matrix organization. The backlog: Should I have a single one capturing all stories for all projects? That would probably lead to complicated sprint planning. Or better a single backlog for each project? But how would I capture priorities between different projects then? For example story a of project 1 is most important, then comes story 1+2+3 of project 2 and then story 2 of project 1 and so on. As hard as the above is the imagination of the sprint plannings for me. Teams should pull stories from the backlog. But how should they do that if several backlogs would exist and the priorities are going zig-zag between them?     The last two points confuses me most, but I would have to solve them before being able to do even the first step. "
1419,"How to handle ""bad quality code"" by a team member","Thing is, we are a start-up.  So far, I have been the only programmer taking care of our desktop app, api, mobile app...etc, but obviously we had to hire another programmer.  He is quite experienced ""frontend developer"", but when he started working on our project, it seemed to me that quality of his code is fairly poor, I mean, if you saw something like file.name.split(""."").pop().toLowerCase()... - and in case . not being included within a string, it throws undefined error... etc.. you know this is bad, and such mistakes could be found on multiple places within the code.  Of course we discussed that, but what would you do if you were me? How to manage such people?  Now I have to review every single line of the code he writes, I am not telling this is bad, quite the contrary, I would like to do it more often, but not from the point of view that on every single line lies a bottle-neck :/ .  It happened multiple times, that makes me sad.  Another thing is, this guy got another task, and it seems to me that I need to refactor a lot of lines from the code, sadly, that code is not usable in production.  Or did we just found bad people? Are there actually developers, who take their code seriously and see stuff like that? (I am very strict about code quality, since our product is used by pretty large amount of people and I want our app not to broke on undefined errors, I would rather it broken on ""no space left on device"" kind of errors :-) ).

1422,What factors should determine a task's priority?,"Is it common to assign a task's priority based solely on its due date? For example, is the following system valid for all scenarios?  Urgent = less than 24 hours High = Not more than 24 hours Medium = 24 to 48 hours Low = within the business week None = no set timeframe   Here's the question: is it not possible to have a High priority item that must be done on 22 December, 2012? So with this task, I'm assuming that the severity (impact) of it not being accomplished on that date is being taken into account when assigning it a priority of ""High"".  Hope the question makes sense. To make things simple, what factors determine a task's priority? Would it be:  a. Timeline b. Severity c. Both   Any other factors that should be taken into account to determine a task's priority? "

I used shots of Gantt chart, Network diagram and critical path.   Can the project documentation plan have the following contents?   Project background. Objectives. Scope. Methodologies. Core functions such as cost, quality, scope and time   Are these enough for a proper project plan documentation?  The nature of the project is research based and consists of only one working resource. No project team. "
1424,Conversion from complexity estimation to actual costs,"We do Scrum - therefore we do not estimate hours or workdays, but estimate complexity (Story Points).   As our customers mostly want to know what a feature might cost, we somehow have to do a conversion from complexity to money. In a big project with several stories for one customer (it seems this is the use-case mostly described) the strength of Scrum is uncertainty and the ability to change priorities after every sprint. In our case most enterprise customers only ""buy"" on feature for an application, so there is no ""balancing"" over time.  My question is, how to deal with such use-cases? How do I convert our estimations to an amount which our customers are (hopefully) willing to pay for? How do we reduce the risk of uncertainty in our estimations? "
1425,How to apply project management skills for a bulky project?,"Suppose I was working on a 3 months web development project, alone. And I had to start developing everything from scratch. I had to perform each and every activity that a software development life cycle required.  How would I manage this project? What would I do to improve the quality of the project and be on track? What are the processes that would help me achieve the target?   I know that MS Project helps the project to be managed. And I know how to use that software. But how would I do it all by myself? "
1426,How to organize knowledge within a wiki?,"Using wikis as a knowledge database becomes more popular since a few years. But now I realized that most of the knowledge is lost because:   articles are out-dated there is more than one page for the same subject one cannot find the right page, because keywords are used everywhere   This is the actual setting at my workplace:   each departement has it's own subsection for its products / services other departements keep summarized (redundant) instructions about using someelse's products but there are also some pages which concern more than one departement   How can I organize a wiki to keep it clean? How do You avoid those problems?  (This is not directly about project management, but I think the project manager must be part of the solution.) "
1427,How to manage long-term software quality requirements?,"As newly assigned manager on an already ongoing agile continuous delivery software development project, one of the objectives is the following.     Ensure that software quality meets long term requirements.   The project consist of 50+ software developers distributed on different sub-products. So far, the following issues has been identified, which can be possible indicators that improvement is needed of the software quality.   No big new features been released in recent time Different UX across sub-products Some software modules are barely maintained after ownership shifts Architect team is not responsible for quality Software developers started leaving project Seem too much coordinating across teams for new initiatives Often workarounds are used meet customer requirements   So far, the approach to quality has been implicit. Recently, the following has been added.   A Definition of Done of epics    This seems not to capture the above 7 issues, as it has a more narrow focus.  Quality seems hard to measure in a purposeful way as suggested by this and this. Further, it seems hard to navigate after the above 7 issues. This leads to the following considerations. How to identify purposeful efforts? How to estimate the effect of the efforts? When is it enough?  Anyone with any experience on how to approach managing long-term software quality focus? "
1428,Can Quality be an adjustable constraint of an agile process?,"When defining the constraints of a project, the classical Iron Triangle defines three concurrent constraints: Resources, Scope and Time. Some more complex models (see the Project Constraint Model) add Quality to the above list.   I understand that view in a classical waterfall view, where quality is a separate process. It makes perfect sense at some level when QA team is some independent entity. The QA team spend time to test product, count defects or missing features and ask for product changes to development team.  But I wonder if it is meaningful to see Quality as an adjustment variable inside an Agile team. As I understand it, Quality should be on par with Velocity. Some structural property of a team that you can measure and try to improve but never really control.  In the past I've seen managers trying to use it as a lever and that lead to unpredictable results. In some cases trying to lower Quality lead to higher Costs, Resources and Development times (defects were caught later in the process, and that has a well known cost). I've also seen exactly the opposite: well meaning teams trying to get higher Quality which translated to heavier processes (more code reviews for instance, or more tests written), and more complex definitions of done... but without any observable positive relationship with customer value reached in the end.  In the end I believe Quality is not a true adjustment variable of Agile process inside of a team, as you can neither control it nor measure it, but merely something like Velocity that can be used for it's predictive power (how many bugs will there be in the final product?) but not really use as an adjustment variable.  Is Quality a legitimate constraint in Agile teams? How should it be measured? Can it be used as an adjustment variable and how? "
1429,How do I convince a client to use SCRUM in a tight deadline and fixed price project?,"This is perhaps an addition to this question: 'How do you convince a client to use Agile Methods'.  But I was not 100% convinced by the answers on that question. What I am asking myself is how to convince a client when you have to work to a very tight schedule?  I already know that by using SCRUM I can follow up the project on a day to day basis and that it has advantages compared to waterfall. But how do you convince your client to go in iterations, not knowing when exactly the project will end or what it will cost...  i.e. A project has to be put in production on the 1st of January 2012, and it is now the 1st of July. How do we get our client convinced that a bunch of iterations will get us to the final result?  Without knowing the exact timeframe or the budget to be spend, I find it rather hard to convince a client of going in to this.  I was in this situation at a client, in which they did developments without a specific method or framework. They did waterfall as they thought it worked best. In the end we convinced them of how Scrum works, who could do what roles, but they didn't do it because of the risk they saw in this. (no specific cost to execute it and deadline)  Perhaps you have good ideas how to convince these type of clients... "
1430,Is Scrum a status report meeting or a developer meeting?,"I'm a developer and we started using Agile last year (October 2011).  And, it has been rough to say the least.  I was always taught Scrum was to discuss the following:   What you did yesterday What you are going to do today Any issues, challenges or roadblocks that might be in the way (at the moment)   My understanding is that this meeting is for the developers, but product owners should be there to answer any questions that may be directed toward them.  Otherwise, this is a meeting to go over developer needs &amp; issues in a manner that is relaxed and for the developers (no one else).  Now here's my issue... In our version, each developer is required give what is tantamount to some kind of Regimented Status Report.  We stand-up and report in the following format:  (a) The Story Number and Name  - Each Task Number in the story that we worked-on  - The Original Time Estimate for the currently discussed task  - The Actual  Time Estimate for the currently discussed task  - An explanation of why we were over or under  ...and so on.  My Question is: Is this Scrum?  Heck, is this Agile? "
1431,How can a new PM manage a failing project in a few hours per week?,"I am working as a beginning scientist and was given the management role for a small project (5 internal scientists, 1-2 external software contractors). What are the absolute essentials I need to manage this successfully?  There are several difficulties ahead right from the start:    the project is already running and not progressing so well,  my boss limits my time spent on this to 1-2 hours per week max, there is a large gap in understanding between the internal people and the external contractors (each are experienced in their knowledge domain),  and I have zero experience in project management, both soft and hard skills.   A lot of good questions and answers on this site give advice how to do things 'right' if this is your primary job and domain of experience. However, I'm looking for a more minimalist answer within my constraints.  How can a new PM manage a failing project in a few hours per week?    A BIG THANK-YOU to all of you who answered this question. I greatly appreciate the thought and experience you put into your answers and they are very helpful. I have come to the conclusion that my first priorities must be to make a Gantt chart and to actively mediate regular communication between the other scientists on the project and our software contractors. My boss has clearly communicated his expectations, and now it's a matter of methodically determining whether they can be fulfilled.  I'd like to add a note here to explain the situation, because I got the feeling that some people were very surprised by this situation and thought it must be uncommon at best, negligent at worst. The fact is, most (all?) scientists in a leadership position are expected to manage multiple projects while additionally conducting their own research in the field, laboratory, or theoretical realm. At the same time, we must also regularly publish the results of our various projects in peer-reviewed journals and books -- ideally as soon as those results are produced (""publish or perish""). What's less common about my situation is that I am trying to manage a project which involves external contractors, and not just students and laboratory staff. However, as one moves up the academic ladder, one needs more and more skill in project management, and this is never actually taught to us. So my position is actually very common. I'm also sure that this sort of situation is not particular to academics -- as David Espina pointed out, project management is something that everyone has to do, but most of us aren't trained to do. "
1432,How to determine the skills of a software developer in a job interview?,"I have come to a new challenge in my career that involves handling some job interviews, and I must determine if the applicant really has mastered the skills he/she lists in his/her CV.  How do I accomplish this? Do I:   Prepare an assignment?  Ask concrete technical questions related to what we need?  Do something else?   Edit: There will be two persons conducting the interview. The other colleague is from the HR department. I must only be sure about the technical knowledge (Programming and architectural abilities.) of the applicant. "
1433,What are some key takeaways from transitioning from a QA Lead to a Scrummaster?,"I'm wanting to transition from the QA Lead in my agile company to a scrummaster role.  We're still in the process of getting the Scrum methodology right, but I think it's important to have someone that knows the process and can facilitate it.  Is it possible to do both? What are some experiences people have witnessed or been a part of that they might be able to share? "
1434,Career Progression from Product Owner,"I work for a multinational IT consultancy firm that has a number of 'software assets' that it sells and develops for its clients. I started with the company straight out of University in a software testing position on a team implementing a solution using one of these assets. In the year I was in that role, I became very familiar with the workings of the system, much more so than the other testers. I was offered a product owner role on one of the development teams and took it.  My question is ""where do I go from here?"". I am currently working as a product owner now, but I would like to know what are the future career options from this role. I have been looking online and there isn't really a whole lot of info there. What should I be doing to achieve the next step, and what would that next step be with my experience? "
1435,How do you get stakeholders who don't care engaged?,"Background – We are a small group (three PMs reporting to a director) doing business improvement projects for a large company. Problems with our processes have been identified, in particular going from vision to solution while starting up projects, and our director has brought myself and a consultant in to try to resolve these.   Issue – I am trying to engage the other two PMs in the group to get them to contribute to the solution. I figured that step one should be sitting down with them to figure out what their vision is for a “happy future”. Unfortunately they see this as a waste of time and refuse to participate, their logic being that (a) they have learned enough on their own to circumvent the problems and (b) their visions will be trumped by the director in any case so why bother. Ultimately they just don’t seem to care enough to go through the process to want to bother (but maybe I'm just interpreting their response that way out of frustration). I see this as a huge issue as they are key stakeholders and not bringing them in to the solution early and often is not going to be conducive to project success.   Question – Is it possible to get stakeholders who don’t care engaged with a project? Or in this particular case where I can get a director to dictate a solution is it worth the effort to get the stakeholders to get engaged?  "
1436,PM salary in the IT industry,I'm currently a developer who recently applied for a project manager position at my company. I was told that being a PM in my company will make me earn less than what a developer will earn. I did however proceed with the application.  While doing some research I came across the following question. To sum up some of the answers it states that a PM should not earn as much as a developer as it's the developers that do the hard work.  How true are these statements when comparing salaries in other IT companies? And are PM's more valued than what one would originally think? 
1437,Badges for project team members for motivation,"Stack Exchange is using nice way to motivate contribution through Badges. I was thinking of implementing this same idea for my project team members. Badges will be awarded to project team members in recognition of their contributions to the project.  I thought I would use the three ranks of badge: Bronze, Silver, Gold. Rank depends on the volume of the effort through the project sprints.  Badges example for development project  Committer: commits working code changes into project repository (e.g. Bronze Committer=10 commits during 1 sprint, Silver Committer=25 commits, Gold Committer=50 commits)  Tester: test release and report bugs (e.g. Bronze Committer=2 bugs during 1 sprint, Silver Committer=5 bugs, Gold Committer=10 bugs)  My questions are:   Do you think this will be a good idea to motivate people and get the project on-time with good quality? Did anyone use similar idea to motivate his team members? If yes, how do you implement it? Giving examples is much appreciated...   What metrics would you suggest to implement this idea and how to measure them? Metrics I thought of like:  coding, commiting, completing tasks on time, testing, recording spent time, commenting in code, objectizing, organizing, integrating, standardizing, creativity and designing.   For above proposed metrics in point #3 (and if you are proposing new metrics), how do you suggest to measure each of these metrics?  "
1438,What is the best way to divide a development team?,"I lead a medium sized team of developers whose skill, age &amp; time in the company vary for quite a bit. Some of the youngest in the team are considered profficient while some of the most seniors (age-wise) are outranked by a large part of the team. Plus, we have new people with less than 2 months in the project, while others have been for more than 3 years.  The problem I have is that we have a new project coming up everyone wants to get into, but everyone is unfamiliar with the skillset required for it and I have to divide my team in two for at least the first couple of months: some of them will stay in the current project, while others will get to work on the ""cool"" project.  In the long term I have already made it clear everyone will get their time on the new project by scheduling rotations, however everyone is eager to get in there first.  I have some concerns with this:   If the experience on the skillset required for the new project is basically the same among all of the devs (quite low), based on what should I choose who moves and who doesn't? Experience is really not a factor i can rely on. How can I justify the desicions I make (or even, should I try to justify them?) What's the best way to keep morale up for those that don't get moved into the cool project (repeating ""you'll get your chance soon"" at some point will not be enough)   I have thought of doing small quizes so that I can pickup who's in the best shape or have at least the most knowledge needed for the ""cool"" project (which kinda gives me some justifications for my actions), however I also think I should just go with those I believe who can get the job right (basically a hunch which would led me to pick those I already have worked with, which practically gets the new guys out of the game).  Any advice would be highly appreciated. "
1439,Resources for reviewing and learning from real-world projects?,"I'm currently studying the ""death march"" phenomenon, as it relates to project management.  (From my understanding, the term ""death march"" refers to a project which is evidently at high risk of failure, but which management continue to drive forward, resulting in overwork, loss of motivation among participants, etc.)  Can you suggest any sources for ""post-mortem"" information regarding projects which might fit this criteria?  Or more generally, are there any resources (offline and/or online) for historical/biographical information about various projects that have been undertaken, how they were planned, how execution went, and what the results were? "
1440,How to define clear processes for different projects?,"I work in a small company, we don't have clear roles and depending on the case somebody different can take the role of project manager, this is great but each one organizes the project different which can create some confusion.   I've been wondering whether it would be a good idea to create a document specifying the process required for each type of project. What is important to include in the document? How can one handle improvements and measure what works best? "
1441,Good podcasts on current project management?,Can you recommend some good downloadable podcasts on project management? Either theory or current issues? 
1442,Develop from Use Cases or Business Requirements,"I'm involved in a project where the business team created a large business requirements document that were using to create product backlog items and acceptance criteria.    However, they have also created use cases that look to contain more interaction between how they see their users interact with the software.    The business team seems to feel the use cases contain more detail with more behaviors around how their users would interact with the software.   My question is: Should we be putting more weight and time into turning the use cases into backlog items/acceptance criteria or stick more to the business requirements, or treat them equally?  Is there any rule of thumb that others use? "
1443,Handling new suggestions to resolved user stories in closed sprint,"In a project managed using scrum framework, I've a situation where all tasks associated to a user story (feature) had been done successfully. No more code changes are allowed since testing is in progress and sprint is near to closing date. However, while testing and reviewing the product, I, product owner or another team members had come with some suggestions to same story.  How to handle these suggestions?     Should new tasks be created in the new sprint and linked to story in previous sprint? Or should a new story created in the new sprint with new tasks? Or there are a better practice for such scenario?!  "
1444,R&D Tax Credit in Agile Scrum,"In an Agile Scrum environment, how do you compute R&amp;D tax credit?  In a 'waterfall' model, the 'Define' and 'Design' phases could be applied.  But in Scrum, how do you do that? "
1445,What are the key roles in a Scrum team?,"Based on my understanding, Product owner, Scrum Master and Development team are the major roles in a Scrum team. I have to setup a .Net Scrum team with 5-8 members. I don't have enough knowledge about Scrum. Can any one please give a solution for this problems?   What are the key roles that should be in a Scrum team? Who conducts the code reviews in a Scrum team? Do Scrum Teams have a role called team lead, and tech lead?  "
1446,How to split developers/QA into smaller teams?,"Our web development company has grown from five to twenty people over a year. We do 2-4 month projects, and usually team size is 2 devs, 1 QA, 1 BA/PM/Scrum master. Our development methodology is Scrum/Agile.  Currently everyone reports to CTO, which is NOT a good way to go for CTO to keep his sanity. Question is - what's the most efficient way to split people into teams? Two approaches emerged:    Split people into mini-teams: project manager (who usually is also business analyst) is in charge of 2 devs and 1 QA. The same team does project after project. Everyone reports to PM. Split by technology: have a team of ~ 5 developers who all do Ruby on Rails (for example), managed by senior developer team lead. Then when we get a new project, team lead gets to decide who to put on the project, and it's up to him how to best utilize talent in his team.   Which one is the better approach? Or maybe there's another one that I've missed? All help would be much appreciated! "
1447,What questions to ask and how to create spec based on provided information,"I am interviewing for a trainee BA position and they have given me this scenario to answer. I am not sure on the correct questions to ask and how to develop a requirements spec based on what is provided.  Please can you guys assist me  Scenario:  Burger-24 is a Burger shop which delivers Burgers 24/7 They are asking to build a website where customers can log their orders and pay, mainly for reducing the telephone calls that are currently the only method for ordering Burgers, and are time-consuming for Burger-24 staff You are a Business Analyst at the company that was hired to build the website. You were tasked to gather requirements for the website and create a specification / requirements page that will be clear both for the developer(s) who will build the website, as well as for Burger-24 owner to understand and approve. 1.  Describe the process of gathering the requirements you are planning to take. What kind of questions you are planning to ask? What considerations need to be taken? (from a BA point of view) 2.  Please create the specification based on the current information given   for part 1.. I can only think of asking the owners to give more details of the current issues and how they wish the website to look and how it will solve the problem they are having  2) I am unsure of how the specification should be based on the current information "
1448,How to track development activity time against tasks,"We are a medium-sized, geographically-dispersed development team using Jira for task management and GIT as our repository.  Our developers are generally focused on one primary development project at a time, but their time can often be divided between that project and other, smaller things (sometimes development-oriented and sometimes not).   For all development-related work (primary project and otherwise) we track tasks in Jira, but for non-development work we don’t.  Our problem is that we want to track development time against tasks and projects, ideally to their Jira tickets, but we have been unsuccessful more than once at getting this off the ground using Jira’s built-in time tracking.  The problems we have run into are that time-tracking against Jira tasks is manual, so without frequent reminders the developers forget or ignore tracking often enough to make the tracking records useless.  We tend to get off to a good start, but once it seems like everyone is in the groove and the reminders diminish, the time tracking starts to fall off too.  Our goal is to find a solution that allows us to track development time against tasks without the need for a lot of manual action by the developers, and ideally that is not too big-brothery.  We want a good work environment, but we also want to have time-spent data.  If there is anyone who has been able to successfully find a solution to this problem, we would love to hear about it.  EDIT...  There are several reasons for wanting to do this, but all revolve around the idea of ensuring our engineers are unblocked and working effectively. An engineer could be getting interruptions from other projects, so their output on their main project is suffering. How do we identify that across several teams of engineers? Is someone's lower than expected productivity because they are not getting sufficient instructions, or because they are getting interruptions, or because they are misunderstanding their tasks?   An early diagnostic of any of these problems would be seeing that an engineer is completing 8 hour tasks in 16 hours on average - or that they are booking 20 hours of project time per week instead of 40 (or whatever are the appropriate numbers for the engineer or the project, of course).  And, no, we're not trying to count keystrokes, or lines of code produced, etc. We're trying to help our engineers be as high-performance as they want to be.  Note, we don't use timesheets now - that's one solution that we've tried in the past but we know from experience the frustrations and limitations of that approach. "
1449,Who truly prioritizes the product backlog? The Product Owner or Team?,"I keep reading that during Product Backlog Grooming the development team meets with the PM and the Product Owner and as a team prioritizes the features.  Is it ultimately the Product Owner who decides the priority (what needs to be worked on and released first)?  Where does the Business Analyst come into this? I thought it was the BA's job to build relationships with the business stakeholders, learn the vision, learn the needs of the customers and work with the business to determine priority and requirements?  Can someone please clarify, thanks! "
1450,Best way to deal with difficult stakeholders?,"My CEO has moments where he is just very difficult to work with. He has a tendency to nit pick and when he nit picks sometimes he overreacts over something minor then makes a mountain out of a molehill.  A few examples:   I am currently product managing a digital product, as part of the job I am responsible for grooming the product backlog and on a weekly basis plan the team's work for the week. As part of the process, I have to show my plan for the week every Monday morning to my CEO. For the past couple of weeks he has been complaining that the work is not planned how he wants it to be planned, when I have on several occasions made it clear that the whole point of reviewing this at the start of the week is so that I can define the sprint goal. The trouble I am having is that I can't anticipate exactly what he wants, until we actually sit down together and review the product roadmap and backlog. I am in the process of delivering a client's project, the normal protocol is for the CEO to review the first draft of the design work. Since this is DESIGN, it is very difficult to get it perfect the first time due to subjectivity of what a good design is, which is why he is involved in the process. I showed him the design, my designer did 5 versions, and he just kept complaining over minor things. Eventually he just told me to not show him the design work to begin with unless it is perfect. I was left scratching my head, trying to define what 'perfect' is.    In both instances, I sat down and handled the situation by being unresponsive, but deep down, it really annoys me and I am a bit concerned that he is never going to be satisfied. The question is: what is the best way to handle a stakeholder/CEO who just moans all of the time? Is there a way to reduce the moaning? "
1451,Executive Summary Repetition,"This might be an intuitive question but it seems that not much people knows it.   Should I repeat information from last report's executive summary or should I only write what happened the week before the report?  Let's say that there is a piece of information that is valid from last week's report, should I keep it or it is assumed that it has been read in the last report? "
1452,When should the architecture of an enterprise level project be created in Scrum?,"First of all, I know, that there is no such entity as Sprint 0 in Scrum. Also, I know, that architecture should not be nailed down during the first Sprint.  Well,  all these principles work fine for us. We start from the prototype in the first Sprint, then gather feedback and in the second or third Sprint we understand the general customer's requirement well and the architecture becomes stable. But all projects were small (max duration is a little bigger then a year with 12 involved persons).  But what should I do with architecture in a large (enterprise level) projects, in which several teams are participating? I believe, that they can't start work together without preliminary coordination. For that coordination a basic architecture should be done first. And for a basic architecture we need to do general requirement gathering and a rough analysis of them.  So:   First of all, Scrum didn't provide any special events for these activities (like Sprint 0). Second, the flow, that I described below looks like a waterfall, not agile.   What we shall do with a complex projects, which demands that we gather general requirements and create an architecture before its implementation? Are there any best practices for this? How do we solve this problem within Scrum? "
1453,How to deal with the current corporate food-chain going in the way when adopting Scrum?,"I am about to become a Scrum Master in one of two teams in a small software company. This is completely new for us.  What bothers me is that our current manager will become the Product Owner and although I try I can't extract from him how his current responsibilities will translate to his new role. Although he is all behind this change, I gather that he is going to continue being ""in charge"".  First off, he convinced the execs to purchase Jira and expects complete and immediate sync with the Scrum board. I pointed out to him that we will probably have enough on our plates at least at the start, but he seems innegotiable. There are other points as well, e.g. he insists we use ""planning poker"" over anything else, etc.  So to put it in a more general question: How does one deal with this sort of situation? WHO gets to deal with it? Where did ""escalation"" go? Is it still there, do I simply escalate to someone else? Do I argue with the guy, who is still my boss? "
1454,Scrum - splitting test from a user story to next sprint,"I am wondering how to manage this sort of issue in the best, Agile way. Let's take our current situation as an example: we have two stories that are technically ""complex"" (simply put, big), that will take some time to be finished. QA testers wait for it to be done so they can test it. The stories are big with documentation and testing being subtasks of the story. During the first Sprint, the stories got put on the back burner because of urgent production bugs that needed to be fixed. We are soon ending our second sprint and yet again, these stories won't be resolved but now because documentation and testing will not have been completed.   So, can we split QA testing and documentation into separate stories rather than having them as subtasks so we can get stories like these resolved during a sprint?   For some background information:    We have 3 week Sprints at the moment but everyone will transition to 2 week Sprints in Autumn so this sort of problem will be more prevalent. So we can't increase the length of our Sprints. If you wonder if we could split the stories smaller then no, it is already small considering. It is either done or not, implemented in our testing environment or not (we can't test a skateboard if it's still a board lying on the shelf).  We do iterations, do a demo for our client and many more at the end of each Sprint and we do have a focus on delivering benefit to the user (functional, technical, etc) at each Sprint - but the release of our product isn't until next year. So we don't have the pressure of ""delivering working software"" as in releasing the whole thing at the end of each sprint. The product does work even though QA testing hasn't been done. So it wouldn't put the project as risk if we split testing and coding to two different Sprints.    So right now I have two stories with coding getting finished, but testing and documentation as subtasks that will stop the stories being resolved. I want to split the subtasks into stories so as to plan them into a Sprint when the coding is done. Is this okay or is there a better way to handle it? "
1455,User story contains a design task that generates other tasks,"I have some user stories that have little tasks on basic design with highest priority. This tasks will lead to a conversation about the basic design of the user story and will generate other tasks for the user story. So, how would you handle this?    I have been told that the design should be done in the sprint for each user story but this would change the sprint backlog because it will generate new tasks derived from the created design what is not good.  One option would be just to add a full iteration where just design (just the necessary not the whole) is done and will generate tasks for the next iteration. But I guess this is not the right way to do it.  Could you comment how you solve this? "
1456,How to use JIRA to track progress over a process with multiple handoffs,"I work on a team that consists of several different groups - researchers, analysts, database analysts, and developer (me).  We load data for our project several times a year, following a consistent (and long) process that involves many handoffs from one group to the next.  We currently use JIRA to track our process development - i.e., improvements, bugs, change requests, etc. - though we don't really use an Agile methodology (since I'm the only developer, I would say we use a 'nothing' methodology, but Waterfall is probably closer than anything).    We would like to begin using JIRA to track our progress through the process itself.  So for example, we might have the following steps:   Pull data from database (DB Analyst) Create initial data product (Developer) Run analysis (Analyst)  Check data product (Researcher) Check analysis (Researcher) Package analysis results for deliver (Developer) Upload analysis results to database (DB Analyst)   These happen more or less sequentially, one leading to the next, and typically need the same steps every time period.  My current plan is to create a single task, effectively a Story (though I don't think it's properly a Story, if I understand Stories properly).  Then, create Subtasks to that Story/Task for each of the above tasks.  I'm not sure if the tasks should start out assigned to their eventual do-ers, or if they should start out assigned to the project owner (we don't really have a PM, but that would be the PM in an ideal setup) and get assigned out when they're ready to be worked.  I'm also considering setting them up where each subtask is a ""blocker"" to the next subtask, though it doesn't look like that's necessarily a good idea based on the UI; it still shows as Open, though at least it has links in the related section to the blocker/blocks tasks.  Is there a 'best practice' way to do this?  Is this not really doable in JIRA?  It does sound like Kanban might be closer to what we're doing here, but honestly I don't think I could get a major shift like that accomplished in a meaningful way.  Is this something I'd need to get a JIRA add-on to make more doable?  (I think we use mostly stock Jira, with some custom templates but not a whole lot.) "
1457,What level of detail should I include in epics?,"I am writing user stories for a new project. One of my epics is:   As a company owner I want a graphical profile so I can build my visual identity.   And then there are multiple user stories linked to this epic for creating a color palette, designing a logo and so on. But I am not sure what kind of details I should add for the epic itself. What should I write in the description of it? Should the epic have acceptance criteria?   One demand is that all graphical elements are vectors; should that be an acceptance criteria for the epic? Or should it be duplicated for all user stories belonging to that epic? "
1458,"In a programming project, how to ensure the project reliability when going up-level on the WBS?","Problem: How to make sure the project keeps reliable knowing that its parts are reliable when tested separately?  Background: Our project is currently structured as having each team working in a specific deliverable. Each deliverable is being built in its specific code branch and there's automation processes testing each deliverable over the branches. As each deliverable progresses, they're merged back into Trunk along with other deliverables.  It's not possible, however, to apply the same automation applied into software pieces into the whole project.   Should exist a specific team to test the integration between deliverables? "
1459,Kanban / Agile Goes Haywire,"I've been practicing Agile and leading a new team for a while in a new organization. Everything works perfectly fine. Task got pulled by the team. Process that is set by the team has been followed by the team without any problem.  Challenge i faced recently was, new task  required to be done by different department normally their manager will issued a ticket to me before my team. but now it seems everyone is assigning to my team mate although keeping me in loop but it doesn't make any sense. Where they communicate straight to my team mate. It seems like the process has been broken.  I'm a little confuse , how can i re-align the team with a proper process and also across other department? Should i talk to the boss about the process once I've apply and follow? "
1460,Should I estimate repeating tasks (besides Stories and Bugs)?,"Besides User Stories and Bugs (no estimation) we have some repeating Tasks in our sprint, which have not much insecurity and a clear scope. For example such a task is ""releasing our plugin"" (building, uploading to the marketplace, writing docu and so on). We do not release every sprint!  For the sake of velocity one could think these Tasks should also have an Story Point estimation just like Stories have (which is no real estimation, as the time / complexity is known). Should we track Impediments in our Agile PM tool just like User Stories and Defects/Bugs? asks in a same way but I am not only thinking about impediments.   We have some more of these Tasks and I wonder what's a proper way to handle them? "
1461,"(Hypothetical) During a Sprint Retrospective, the Development team proposes moving the Daily scrum to twice daily","This hypothetical question is directly-inspired by this Question.     During a Sprint Retrospective, the Development team proposes moving   the Daily scrum to occur twice per day -- once in the morning and once in the afternoon. Not daily.   Which two are the most appropriate responses for the Scrum Master?   (Select two best answers)         Coach the team on why the Daily Scrum is important as an opportunity   to update the plan    Learn why the Development Team wants this and work   with them to improve the outcome of the daily Scrum    Consider the   request and decide on when the Daily Scrum should occur.    Have   the developers vote    Acknowledge and support self-organizing team’s   decision      From a Scrum viewpoint, is this original question and this updated version essentially the same question and therefore have the same answer?  My own thinking on the topic keeps vacillating so I'm hoping someone more experienced with the process can provide some guidance. "
1462,what to do with out of scope tickets in JIRA,"I've created a number of tickets (user stories) and added them to the backlog, however on review the stories are now deemed out of scope.

1463,"Is there room for good/tested design in ""Agile"" setting?","I just came out of an ""Agile"" team where the sprints are 3-weeks long, and during this same time, about 12 hours of that time is spent on exercises such as Scrum grooming, reviewing, Scrum, and retrospective, and the team works to develop and test within the time left.  Of course, this is the typical Agile implementation you find in many small/medium sized companies. You hear talks of avoiding code smells etc. in many of these settings, but the fact is many Agile teams I have worked with rarely spend more than 1 hour thinking of the design for the story/tasks on their plate. My question is, to ensure you do not end up with spagetti code, how much of the sprint-time should be allocated to ensuring that each and every new feature, new tweak,patch, passes the ""good design"" test?  I came across this article on Martin Fowler's blog, Is Design Dead?. I do believe that is an excellent read however, real-world implementation of these methodologies (XP, Scrum and Agile included) tend to throw design out the window. My question is, is there really room for good design in today's 2-3 week sprint ""Agile"" implementation world?  Maybe I should re-state that nowhere have I suggested that the Martin Fowler article included above says there is no room for good design. That article actually argues otherwise.  My question here is simply to understand where 'good design' fits into real world implementations of the various ""agile"" methodologies. In a typical agile team, you may find that some of the stories where created long before many of the team members were brought on board. When you have a team of ,say, 10 developers that pick up 30 tasks to work on for the next sprint, how do they ensure that each piece is correctly designed to integrate and scale with the rest of the application?

1464,How to calculate earned value (EV) in this example?,"   You are managing a project with a total planned budget of $100,000. To   date, you have actually spent $41,000. When you look at all the   activities you have completed to date, you see that you planned to   spend $33,000 on the activities you've actually completed. And when   you look at your original baseline plan, you see that your budget was   planned to spend $50,000 by this date. Determine the PV, AC, EV, and   BAC.   I Was able to calculate PV, AC, BAC correctly in this example but Earned Value.  I think to date we planned to complete 50% of the project hence PV = $50,000 but how to calculate EV in this example.

1465,Can pair programming work under Scrum iterations,"Is it possible?  Or in a more generic question, can XP work under Scrum iterations? "
1466,Splitting user stories,"I'm trying to figure out a way to split user stories in a way that we can incrementally create value upon completing them at the end of the Sprint. I'm using Mike Cohn's book, User Stories Applied as a guide. The platform I'm building has a lot of back and forth between the tasks for the end user and the site administrator actors. This makes it very tempting to split a story on technical boundaries like so:  As a Site Administrator, I should be able to configure the main category banner text and image  As a User, I should be able to view the banner image and text in my language on all devices  Although this seems to be a reasonable breakdown, it introduces dependencies between the tasks for the entire story to be complete. This might lead to the possibility of partially completed stories at the end of the Sprint - without a tangible value add. One possibility is consolidating the story into a single one and adding both of the above as subtasks for the story.  As a ???, I should be able to configure banner text and image  As you can see, this does not feel intuitive. Do you feel that there is a better way to approach the problem? "
1467,User story mapping - producer/consumer process,"My product has two types of users: producers (i.e., admin panel users) and consumers (end users).  Consumers are able to interact with an app and producers are able to process consumers' requests from the admin panel. Let's examine a simple process, say ordering something:    It seems fine if I describe consumer story only, but I need to map producer's stories too. Where should I add them? I see two ways to solve the issue:   Add them to the same map with a different color (there would actually be multiple cards instead of one for the producer):    This doesn't seem like a good idea to me, because I'm ""mixing"" two user types. I haven't seen any examples that do it like this (which disturbs me). Make a completely different map for the admin panel, where only producer stories will be described. This is not an ideal solution too, because it would seem like a completely different product, detached from the consumer's app.   Is there a better approach for this situation? I want to visualize the whole process, yet not clutter it up. Maybe there's a way to add another layer to the map to divide user stories or something. "
1468,How best can I handle/warn about a Sprint's spill-over?,"After the end of a Sprint, many times there are some undone items left. How best, as a Scrum Master, can I ensure the Team is able to do all the stories/tasks that were picked by the Team for the Sprint?  Also, what are the best communication channels for sharing the red flags with management and the business about the delay in specific stories or tasks? "
1469,Communication Management: Booking meetings in advance via email,"To overcome the obstacle of clients not responding on time, an idea our management (not PMs) team has proposed is to send multiple email meetings invites ahead of milestones that are outlined in the schedule.  Example: On Project A, the milestones are:   Approval of technical specifications - Meeting 1 Approval of Network Systems Management Plan - Meeting 2  Completion of UAT - Meeting 3   In this example (a smaller project), each of these meetings can have a gap of about 3-4 weeks.  Is it wise to send email meeting invites in advance for each of these 3 meetings in a single email? Should we include this in our Communications Management plan?  The meetings, to add a bit more detail, are only done via conference calls to save time, not in-person.  The concern is what happens if one milestone isn't going to be completed on time. In that case, Meeting 1 is no longer possible and this means a rescheduling of all subsequent appointments. "
1470,Stories in test at end of sprint,"We are a small team (3 devs and 2 testers) and we have successfully used Scrum for 6 months, despite being a really small team for this methodology. I am a rookie as a Scrum Master.  Now, we have started to experience problems with Sprints ending with tickets that are finished by devs -in theory - but tester has not had enough time to test them.  How should we handle this? Extending the Sprint is not allowed, so moving the tickets to the next Sprint seems to be ok, but how we could estimate them? Since testers could find big problems that could drive new fixes.  Edit: More information: we had 7 tickets... this main ticket was took first, and it tooks from start to end of sprint, so we have just ONE finished ticket. It is the weirdest sprint that we had. Of course: the worst estimation ever, but our retrospective will look so strange with just one finished ticket, and the other with development finished but nothing of test... Administratively what should I do? back to backlog and starting again? estimating the original story point - dev time (that is already ""finished"")? "
1471,Is software development becoming some sort of anarchic system around the world?,"In the last 10 years with the spread of Agile, I've seen developers taking more and more responsibility in the make of the software. Usually the implementation decisions are a team job and not anymore a single person task. But... is there still space for managers?  Now I'm starting my own company and I started putting together a small team, and it's interesting to notice that the more a developer is skilled, the more he pretends to have a say in the implementation. However, considered the investment is mine, I'd like to take important decisions about the implementation myself. Today this has become impossible without getting people upset. Is there a solution to all of this? Or should I limit my decisions to the functionality and leave all the implementation details to the team? "

The Start and Finish dates for all affected Summaries and Tasks did update automatically and are accurate. However, the highest level Summary, ""Calendar Project"", still shows the same % Complete as it did before, even though the Finish date has increased significantly due to the ""Demo"" phase being added. I would expect this % Complete to decrease since the Finish date increased. I have tried clicking the ""Update Project"" and ""Calculate Project"" buttons and they are not updating this % Complete. What is going on here and how can I fix it? Thank you.  EDIT: As a test I increased the ""Demo Implementation"" Task from 1 day to 100 days, which almost doubles the full timeline of the project, but the % Complete for the ""Calendar Project"" Summary only goes from 54% to 41%. So that % Complete is being updated, just not significantly. Maybe this is because I'm in the middle of the project? "

So let's say I have only two people who can do work on a project. How can I set tasks so dates do not overlap if I use the same resource?   Is there a way project can link these dependent tasks based on the resource assigned to the tasks?  In a nut shell, if I have 10 tasks that take a day each and I have the two people able to do those tasks I want to have a chain of tasks that person A is working strung together with dependencies because some tasks will have to wait for others to be finished, since they all rely on the same resource to complete them all. As a result I should have two chains of five tasks in each person's chain.  Note: I don't want to set these dependencies manually. "
1476,Retrospective - too many small and random problems. Death by a thousand needles,"After reading some literature about retrospective and actions it is not clear to me what to do if team faces big variety of random and small issues during sprint, and these problems do not occur often.  For example, there is: - a bad code region where it is hard to implement new features, but features that touch this code come 1-2 times per year(of course this is just an observation of the historical events and there is no guaranty that this will not change in a month). It will take 1 week to, refactor the code; - Or there was a rare story that requires complicated deployment process, but the same, such stories/tasks happen few times per year and it usually takes 2 days to do it.  Because actions from retrospective take teams time that can be dedicated to implement new product features it is not clear if team should pick any of such actions.  Should team just take the biggest impactful problem despite the fact that it is rare? Or should it collect more data and don't take any action items from retro( besides data collection)? "
1477,"Faulty piece of software discovered, next steps for a Project Manager to take","Consider the following scenario, which is straight out of a PMP exam prep book:     The project manager of a large software implementation project just   finished a project status meeting. In the meeting, he learned that a   crucial piece of the software his team was creating is faulty. The   news will cause the project to be late by at least one month and will   likely cost additional fees for the developers' time. What is the next   step the project manager should take?         Fire the project team member responsible for the mistake.   Create a change request for the immediate correction to the software.   Complete a root-cause analysis to determine why the problem occurred.   Present the news to management and the customer with a solution to resolve the problem.      My first instinct is that the ""next step"" should be #3, preform a root-cause analysis. However, the exam prep book states the following:     Number 4 is correct. The project manager needs to share the news with   management and the customers with a solution to fix the problem. The   project manager should never go to management with a problem without a   solution.      Number 3 is incorrect. Root-cause analysis can be helpful, but it   should be completed after informing both management and the customer.   I'm having trouble understanding their line of reasoning, and my question is two-fold:   In a real-world life environment (not the PMP exam), would it really be appropriate to come up with a solution before doing root-cause analysis? And if so, how are you supposed to determine a solution, if you haven't even figured out the root-cause of the problem? Even on the PMP exam, is what the book is presenting accurate? How can the PMP exam authors consider you able to present a solution if you haven't done a root-cause analysis?  "

1483,Measuring performance in kanban,"Let's assume I decide to manage a certain project using Kanban. This happens to be a customer service kind of project where the dev team delivers continuous improvement so Kanban is definitely well suited and scrum would probably be over the top and ultimately unnecessary.  Let's also assume I want to measure the performance of the team. I know someone prescribes to take a, say, two weeks activity and count the number of tasks delivered in that timespan. You can repeat that process every two weeks and so monitor performance. It is advisable to break down stories so that they are kind of comparable and basically become a unit of measure.   I have never used Kanban before but being able to break down stories into similar sized ones sounds like a not very feasible goal to me. In fact the more I think about it the more it seems difficult.  What about adding story points to each task on the board before starting development as we do in Scrum? Would that be a theoretically sound practice? "
1484,Azure DevOps - how to know a Resolved work item is actviely being tested (vs. in the queue),"TLDR;  Does Azure DevOps have a recommended built in way of marking Resolved Work Items as being actively tested as opposed of being in the queue for testing?   Details  My team is using Azure DevOps with Agile workflow.   This means that out-of-the box a user story goes through the following states   New -> Implementation started ->  Active -> Code complete ->  Resolved -> Acceptance tests passed ->  Closed    This is nicely shown at docs.microsoft.com:    Testing happens in when the story (or bug) is in the Resolved state.   The out of the box board has 4 lanes.   When looking at the board (or even in queries) I'm having trouble seeing what is being actively tested.   For example, if there are 2 resolved items it is not clear which one is being actively worked on and which one is waiting to be picked up.   Showing what is being tested seems like a common desire and my intuition is that the solution for my problem is built in. I want to avoid customising the workflow (and adding a new state called Testing).  "
1485,How do I foster communication in Project Meetings?,"Context:  I'll admit, I've recently transitioned to a PM role at a new company, and the atmosphere is slightly different than the previous firm I worked at.   I was a 'Project Manager'  (note the quotations) at my previous role, but it wasnt a position that had enterprise-wide visibility.   In my current role, I've got quite a handful - I like challenges - and I'm loving it.   The problem I'm finding right now is that with some of the projects I'm handling, I find that I'm the only one who's talking in the team meetings.   Its not that I'm afraid of speaking up in front of people, but I really really want to foster communication and get the whole group-chatter going.   How do I foster this?   I frequently pause and ask for any questions/ feedback, I encourage people to interrupt me or criticize me, and I've got a pretty friendly personality overall.     And yet, I'm just coming off project kick off meeting this morning that barely lasted half an hour.   Due to the nature of the project (its a program, really), I couldnt get into risk assessment or planning the schedule, but I'm finding that my meetings frequently last &lt;30 minutes, whereas other PMs can easily stretch it into 60 minutes.   I'm a fan for short, to-the-point meetings, but sometimes I wonder if I'm making the meetings too short to cover everything that could/should be covered.    I'm wondering if its because I'm new to the company and may not know some specific history (pertaining to the project) or of the various groups.    Are there any tips/ tricks you guys use to improve / foster group chatter?  "

For example, let's say I have 3 points of topic to cover in a meeting, all of varying degrees of importance.  Is it best to deliver the strongest point first or last in order to maximize information retention and efficiency in the audience?  Does it change if it is phone based vs. face-to-face?  My initial thought would be last*, but I figured studies may have been done on this before. "
1487,Aiming to finish development of sprint a bit early to give testers time,"I'm about to start a new development project that our company would like to run in an agile manner.  At this stage I am the only developer but it is expected 1-2 more will join in future sprints.  Given that we have been doing a lot of story elaboration discussions in preparation for our first sprint.  As part of the elaboration we have estimated the tasks using story points so that the PM could give a quote to the customer.  Part of the discussion required putting an hour against points so it could be converted to a cost.   From this, our PM has determined how many points are to go into the sprint given how many hours we have as a development.  I have suggested to the PM that in order to meet each sprint as best as possible the development team aims to complete the last story at least 1/2 a day (or full day?) ahead of schedule to give the testing team time to test and then subsequent bugs fixed (as required).  That is because we have included testing in our definition of done.  However, he did want that as he didn't want developers sitting around doing ""nothing"" so to speak.  I thought that was unlikely as there will always be ""bug fixes"", ""refactoring"", ""code review"", ""design discussions"", ""other work"", ""spring planning"", ""Sprint retrospectives"" etc that could all fill in the day if required.   Is this an acceptable request?  How do other development teams ensure they meet a definition of done that includes ""in house testing complete"" within a sprint. "

For example there is a resource allocated to Task 1 that starts in Dec 2015 and ends Jan 2017. The same resource will also work on Task 2 that starts Dec 2016 and ends Jan 2018. During the overlap period of Dec 2016 - Jan 2017 the resource is available to the project a 100%, however the availability for each task is only 50%.  During the period where there is no overlap the resource is available a 100% to the respective task  Is there a way to define this type of resource availability to a task using a date range?

How do I approach this so that I can provide the stakeholders an end date?  I have a prioritized backlog and I provide the stakeholders with an end date but we discover new information or PBIs that were estimated at 5 story points but are actually 8s, resulting in the end date being pushed back and back and back. Is this normal behavior and how do I approach this situation?  "
1491,How to estimate time required and deadlines for creative and problem-solving tasks?,"How to quantify time requirements for tasks that are almost purely problem-solving or creative? And how to set deadlines based on those estimates?  Practical scenario in my team:  Steve must find a solution to a never seen before problem A, which includes researching/reading up about similar problems, analyzing the problem A and trying out various ideas until he finds the solution. The company wants problem A to be figured out and solved by end of this week. At the same time, there is another task B which we know will take around 30 hours, and that needs to be done by end of next week. Senior management wants regular updates on status of B and is not keen on doing it last minute.  Both A and B must be done by Steve.  How exactly can I quantify A so that I can, for example, ask senior management that we start B later?  Gut feeling says researching and figuring out what A is may take a whole day, implementing it four-five days. Could I then say that A will take six days, after which we can dedicate four full days to problem B?  Any other ideas how I can tackle a problem like this? "
1492,How to form scrum teams,"I work as a scrum master in a place where we have two distinct products. And these products have submodules:  Product A: (The bigger product)   Submodule A.1   Submodule A.2   Submodule A.3   etc.  Product B: (The smaller product)   Submodule B.1   Submodule B.2   Submodule B.3   etc.   Right now we have two teams. Product A team (Consisting of 12 developers) And Product B team (Consisting of 3 developers)  And also we have two testers who are not actually part of these teams and have a diffrent backlog.  In our teams we have code reviewing process which is done before an issue is resolved. So a code which is unreviewed by a peer cannot be marked as done.  I know 12 developers is much for a scrum team and 3 developers is a small number for a scrum team. Because of this and for some other reasons we are facing some problems.  1) Product B team is moving at a slow pace and losing too much time on issues. The code reviews are not done throughly and buggy codes are being marked as done. The B team is actually not much like a team, everyone having their own goals. That is because one developer is always working on the core features and on an operating system level. The other developer is always working on the User Interface side (actually he is not a UI designer, but a backend developer) and the other developer has joined the team recently and working on ways and making research on how to make the product run with more performance.   So the developer working on the operating system level is reviewing the UI codes. The UI developer is reviewing the OS level codes. They actually do not have the expertise to review each others code and doesn't really know or isn't really interested on what another is doing.   2) Product A team is a big team and the product is a huge product. It consists of several (like 10) submodules. All submodules are distinct modules on the server side (sometimes they use common libraries and common conf files, modules etc. but generally distinct) but they all share the same GUI (A java swing application is used to manage all these modules) So 2 developers are always working on the GUI, some developers work on most of the modules on backend side. And some developers are always working on the same submodule (For ex: Submodule A.1 and Submodule A.2) So those guys have much expertise on that module, but doesn't know much about the rest of the product. Whereas the other developers know much of the product except from those submodules (Submodule A.1 and Submodule A.2)  Actually all of our developers are good developers who can handle whatever you throw at them. But of course some of them are better on the UI side whereas some of them are better on the backend side. Some have gained much expertise on a specific module, so a job on that specific module is always done by that specific person. This leads to one man shows, the failure and success becomes his not the teams.  So my main question is how should we form teams and backlogs? Right now we have to teams (product A and product B team) and two backlogs (Product A and Product B backlog). Should we keep this?  We are planning to create teams like OS Team, Platform Team, Frontend team, Architecture team, Implementation Team, Test team, Security team, Documentation team. Actually I don't even know how this will happen, we don't even have that much developer. Maybe one person will be in multiple teams, I don't know. And if we create teams like this how should we form the backlogs?  But I think this kind of team structure is against scrum, because scrum teams should be cross functional. All kinds of expertise should be in teams.  Or should we create new teams at the beginning of each sprint according to the sprint's needs. But how will this be (Who will attend which sprint planning meeting?)  P.S: Product A and Product B developers are skilled enough to work on the other product.   And according to the team structure you will recommend how many scrum masters should we have. Is one scrum master is enough or should each team have their own scrum masters? "
1493,What personality traits suggest that a person should move towards project management?,"I've just started as an intern for a big company, so this obviously doesn't immediately apply to me.  I love programming, however, I'm still considering potential career paths I may be most suited for.  I've read a lot of stories on here about people moving up to management, regretting their choice and moving back to programming.    What personality traits imply that project management is the right route for a programmer?  What types of people make the best managers and enjoy the role? "
1494,Is there any published research about story points vs time estimation?,"We're getting started with Scrum and have had a few debates about whether we should estimate in story points or ideal hours.  The team is pretty divided, so I'd like to know if any real studies have been done about which is more effective.  I've certainly read a lot of opinions on which is better and, while there are good arguments for each, I haven't found a single book, article, or post on a web page that's backed up by concrete numbers.  So, have there been any studies done that I haven't come across?  How about psychology research on absolute vs. relative estimates?  If those don't exist, what about real-world examples of what has worked for different teams in various types of companies? "
1495,Support for Resource Overview in Omniplan,"In Omniplan 2.3.5, Is there any way to create a Resource report similar to the report Microsoft Project offers?   This report should include:   how many hours does a resource work  when do they start when do they end and  export this in report or chart   Alternatively, would it be possible to do by importing the project file to a different program? I tried using  Microsoft Project, but the data is not correctly transferred (I get wrong days and no resources).  "
1496,Filling PMP Application as Consultant - Project Role and Organization Details,"As a person who is currently working as Consultant at an IT Consulting Firm which roles have ranged from Project Manager, Project Coordinator, Project Expeditor and Project Contributor, how should I fill out the application for the PMP certification?   What should I put down as my project role?   Should it be ""Consultant"" for all client projects? Should I put down ""Other"" and then say ""Consultant - Project Coordinator""? Does anyone know the exact definitions of the roles listed in the PMP application form? They do not match the roles defined in PMP terms  For organization details, should I put the information of the consulting company I work for or should I put the information of the client organization for whom the project was being conducted?   All constructive feedback is appreciated! "
1497,Who writes the test cases for your client when it's time for Client Acceptance Testing?,"This question has recently come up at my organization. When it's time for the client to review and accept either a large ecommerce implementation or a smaller feature enhancement, will your QA team write the test cases for your client to use or will you leave this for your client to do?  The concern is that the client either will not have the time or focus to be able to write the test cases and do a full system test. But maybe this is ok, if we agree that the purpose of Client Acceptance Testing is for the client to poke around in whatever way s/he is accustomed to and see if anything breaks.  What have you done? "
1498,Relevant metrics for issue closure estimation,"What metrics can influence or help with such an estimation?  I am mostly interested in applying such metrics on GitHub projects, using their issues history. Based on how fast they solved their previous issues, or other GitHub data, what metrics can I compute to help me with this estimation?  Note that I'm not interested in any automatic effort estimation methods. Only metrics that can, potentially, help with that. I will use those metrics to come up with my own automatic effort estimation methods, but that is beyond the scope of this question.  If you have any suggestions for a GitHub-specific metric using their search+filters or their API, that is also great.  The metrics should be simple. By simple, I mean that they should return some numeric values, where higher (or lower) means a more (or less) active project, relative to whatever baseline.  What I'm actually needing this for  I am working on a machine learning project that is supposed to estimate effort in hours based on metrics. For this, I am interested in using one for activity. I want something that is easy to compute using github data and that I can reference somehow. I want to focus on easy computation rather than quality, in hopes that other metrics and data I will use will fill in the quality part. I'm also happy to use one of the metrics I came up with, as long as there is some reference that they have been, at one point, used in either research or practice, with at least some degree of success. "
1499,How to use TFS 2015 Agile template artifacts in practice?,"I am part of a company that is just establishing our process methodology for using the SAFe version of Agile, and leveraging the TFS 2015 Agile process template.  Our team has several questions regarding the proper usage of the artifacts.  Primarily our teams consist of BAs, QAs, and Devs.  The questions we are currently dealing with are:  1) User Story - Who creates the user story? - Should the assignment of the user story change through the life of the user story?  (ie: BA creates the user story, then assigns it to the developer, who then assigns it to the tester...) Or should the user story always stay assigned to the creator and tasks get created underneath it that are then assigned to people to work on?  2) Tracking what is in a ""release"" - Our teams have been using an additional field created on the User Story to track a ""Status"", which contains things like ""Deploy to "", ""Deployed to "", ""Deploy to ""... etc.  This is to help inform the testers of what user stories are available to be tested.  We currently do not have a firm grasp on how to properly track this information.  Some are arguing that this added field should not exist on the user story at all, while other are adamant that this Status field is more valuable than the native State field of the user story.  The bottom line is, what is best practice for determining what is available to be tested in what environment?  Perhaps we are doing Agile wrong and are not even close to hitting the mark here, so some advice and guidance in this regard would be appreciated.  I would appreciate if you could share your own experiences of what has/hasn't worked and/or point me to additional resources that help with the practical application of the TFS artifacts as they are used to track work along with code, testing and deployments.  Thank you. "
1500,RUP document templates,"I've been searching all over the internet for templates of RUP documents(e.g. Requirements, Software architecture...). If I'm not mistaken the documents are called artifacts  I would like to understand which should be the exact content of these documents. Based on the name one could get a general idea, however, it's good to understand what the RUP methodology expects to see in each document.  Do you know where I could find these templates? Are they for free, or maybe I have to pay for them?  Many thanks "
1501,How do you employ agility in defining the strategy of a project?,"When defining the strategy of a given project based on it's mission to deliver well-defined goals to meet the organization's vision, how do you employ the philosophy of agility as well as it's quality attributes such as speed, value, etc?   Is there a well-trodden path of how to's? What are good examples   Another way of asking the question possibly would be is how does one use Agile to define a strategy of a given project?  "
1502,How can a PM prevent a train wreck in progress?,"Our mid-size development team is doing a multi-year project. We always had major technical concerns that were never resolved. Now we find ourselves part of the way over a cliff: the architecture direction is misguided, the business plan doesn't make complete sense, and the team is overly scattered and not focused on the same goals. But the project already has significant momentum, and management doesn't see the danger or feel concern about the problem. Although the warning signs of low quality, continuing arguments, and fuzzy requirements are showing. As a project manager in the middle of the project, how should I work to prevent what i think is a train wreck in progress? How can I protect the development team, and the project, from what I think will be painful major changes and throwing away of work, in the next 2-3 months. How do I save a project that is starting to run off its rails? "
1503,Short initiation for lazy colleagues,"Last summer I finished a PBA in Software Development. and got hired into a Company with a small IT department. (8 Guys.. 4 developers)  We make inhouse solutions, from services to websites or small applications. These four developers are working kinda rogue.  What would usually happen is a guy from the legal department wants a small app that can do something, like sort our legal documents. So he grabs a developer. they talk about it, and the developer does it.  Then we have experienced some issues like these:     1: A boss somewhere determinds we don't need the program anyway      2: It takes a lot longer to make, or is more complicated      3: The developer and the user don't agree on the result   So my boss asked me to create a standard way for us to project initiate, to avoid these Things. (I've been taught Prince2 and SCRUM) But here is the problem.  If I make them fill out project initiation documents, with full buisness case and risk analysis etc. they simple won't do it.  So I need a compressed version, and that is why I'm here I'm here to ask, for creating smaller sites and applications, what is the core data you need before starting.  I was thinking something like this:     1: Owner: WHO is responsible and WHO decides outside IT      2: Buisiness Case Description: Why are we making it?       3: timetable      4: Cost      5: Requirements and/or user stories (created with owner) &lt;-- So many times we haven't had matching specs with the user   What else? .. if this exceeds two documents, its not gonna get done.

1504,"Interview question on ""convince your programmers to work that hard""","If you have been asked the following question during an interview. What would be your answer?   You have only 2 weeks before the deadline to fix 500 bugs. Since there is no more other programmers available to join your team, your programmers will have no other choice than to work overtime, including 2 week-ends.   How do you convince your programmers to work that hard?   Provide the keys of your speech to your team.        Provide some concrete ideas to keep them they motivated during the week end.   I am particularly interested in what key points would you give in your speech "
1505,How can the team improve the likelihood of completing each increment?,"If a Development Team doesn't have the skills or tools to create a “Done"" increment, are there techniques that can be used immediately that will allow progress on the increment to be easier to track? I am thinking the team could immediately use TDD, ATDD, or implement a physical board to visualize work.  What else might improve the team's ability to complete work? "
1506,How to manage monthly customer activities?,"Suppose you allocate to your customers 3 of Activity A/month and 5 of Activity B/month.  How do you keep track of what you've allocated and what they've used every month?  Something that is going to show me this on the first of the month:                     Activity A          Activity B Customer Lily          3                  0 Customer Chuck         3                  5 Customer Francis       3                  5   and this in the middle of the month, etc:                  Activity A          Activity B Customer Lily          3                  5 Customer Chuck         1                  4 Customer Francis       1                  2   So I know what they've used and how many are remaining.

1507,Product Owner role in Scrum,"I have a very basic knowledge of Scrum. Please guide me about the following questions:   What is role of the Product Owner in daily Scrum, should PO be a part of this meeting? In a real world scenario a Product Owner is the person who acts as the customer. Can a team member be nominated as a Proxy of product owner? Can we say that a Project Manager who directly interacts with the customer is nominated as the proxy of a Product Owner? When we use term External Stakeholders Engagement, are we referring to a Product Owner or someone else?  "
1508,Green as grass: PRINCE2 or Agile?,"Post completing a Psychology degree I've found myself in a health-tech startup acting as Research and Development Manager. As there's only three of us in the team, we have hybrid roles and as a result I've been engaging and leading projects somewhat.   I enjoy working in the start-up scene and like the way 'agile' works but wonder do I need a prince background to further my [lack of] understanding? Or would a Agile course (Please link me to one?) be better?  I'm self funding this which sucks but I think is something which should be taken into account.  "
1509,"Divide ""stories"" into tasks or columns?","My team's core job (we're not in the software business) is to install hardware at sites which typically takes around a month start to finish and typically involves around 5 or so distinct stages (site review, planning, assembly, installation, documentation). In addition to that we also do maintenance and various other smaller tasks and one-off projects.  We're introducing Kanban and my initial idea was to have a core job lane and split it into five columns as above. Using t-shirt size estimates we would end up with fairly large (XL) tasks among many smaller ones. The other option of course, is to go with simple ToDo, Doing, Done columns and add a ""site review"", ""planning"", etc. as individual tasks for each job.  Is there an advantage of choosing one over the other? Also, if we divide our jobs (I guess we could call them ""stories"") into smaller tasks, how do people practically represent stories and link them to tasks on their (physical) Kanban board? "
1510,Story Point Estimation,"Having used ""days"" as the unit for estimation of tasks in Scrum I find it hard to change to using Story Points. I believe story points should be used as they are more comparable to each other - being less dependent on the qualifications of whoever addresses the task etc. However, it isn't easy to make a team start using Story Points when they're used to estimating in days.  So, how to make a team change to Story Points? What should motivate the team members to do so, and how should we apply the switch? "
1511,Feature team - Chapter size,"I work in an organization where we are moving towards feature teams.  We have four squads and seven chapters such as web development, api development, back-office development... Prior to this we had a single team, where developments were assigned to component experts (account management, payment, front end...).  When presented to the team, the most frequent objection was: ""I am now limited to a single chapter (e.g web development) when I rather work on the full stack (web, api, back-office)""  Do you think people should focus on a single technical item (front end, backend service, ...) or broaden their skills ? How do you handle this in your teams ?  "
1512,Feature Teams - Project with multiple teams,"We are starting a new project that spans multiple teams (squads). I don't really know how to handle this situation.   Do you create a new team for this project ? Do you split user stories on both existing teams ?  I do not think the first approach is the right one, but I worry about adding dependencies between teams with the second approach. Is there a better alternative ? "
1513,"Which skill should a self-taught, overloaded project manager deepen?","I run a small - 2 Full time employee - web development company, with me being programmer and developer at the same time. We service a small number of clients (&lt; 10), of which there is usually 1-2 new ones and the others are ongoing maintenance and upgrades for existing clients. Our billing model is purely time based, but a significant percentage of projects are fixed price based on a certain amount of scope.  We have a pipeline of booked work of ca 900h, this includes: - marketing overhead (small and automated) - administrative overhead (small, automated and outsourced)  Ca 180h of these are not ""closed sales"" however from experience I know that there will be an equal amount of unknown emergency work that will pop up to close the gap.  There is also ca 80h of ""technology debt"" that we are committed to working off.  We had this (pre-)load of work for about 1 year now.  In terms of project management: - we create written scope documents at the beginning of each project, most of our technology debt has been caused by a lack of scope formalisation - we track time very accurately (www.workflowmax.com - we track bugs and scope changes, but only internally and informally by email with clients (www.mantisbt.com) - we have just started to use www.liquidplanner.com, which has actually made visible how much work we have on.  Specifically on Liquidplanner, I only irregularly load new work on and review progress on existing work every 1-2 weeks.  My main concern is to create very predictable deadlines for our open work, so that we - manage client expectations and even longer booked out work pipelines - hire at the right time - predict cashflow better  What area of project management would you recommend to focus on to improve on predictability  of when work gets done?   More accurate capturing and estimation? more frequent/ more formalised progress tracking? more formal change management? else?  "
1514,"Working with a ""single point of contact""","I've often seen it recommended to include a ""single point of contact"" clause in the contract. This stipulates that all communication between a client company and your own company must be made between a single representative on each end. This greatly helps prevent miscommunication.  My question is this: how do you deal with that when working with a project management tool like Basecamp? Do you only add your point of contact to the project? What if he wants to show the work to other members in the company?  UPDATE: This is the recommended single point of contact clause provided in the Graphic Artist's Guild handbook:     The Studio will make every good faith effort to test all deliverables   thoroughly and make all necessary corrections as a result of such   testing prior to handing over the deliverables to the Client. Upon   receipt of the deliverables, the Client shall either accept the   deliverable and make the milestone payment set forth herein or provide   the Studio with written notice of any corrections to be made and a   suggested date for completion which should be mutually acceptable to   both the Studio and the Client. The Studio shall designate   __________ and the Client shall designate _________ as the only designated persons who will send and accept all deliverables and   receive and make all communications between the Studio and the Client.   Neither party shall have any obligation to consider for approval or   respond to materials submitted other than through the designated   persons listed above. Each party has the right to change its   designated person upon ____ day(s) notice to the other.   I'm just wondering how this is even relevant if you're communicating with many different people throughout the course of the project? "
1515,What is the different between Application Management and Configuration Management in ITIL v3?,"What is the difference between Application Management and Configuration Management, in the specific context of managing version, resources and architectures of internally developed applications?  My first thought Configuration Management was the responsible for managing these three configuration items (are they CIs?), but my organization believes it is under Application Management, since it is in the scope of managing an application. "
1516,When can a project's wrong estimates be justified?,"This question is not about project estimation techniques, initial processes, etc. Assume everything was done correctly.  Recently, we gave an estimation for an Android application with development team. The initial estimation was 2 months. Now, when we are about to deliver the project, we will be at least 5-10 days late.  The app which we are developing is Facebook specific. It is like a 2nd FB client, something like a Facebook plugin, so the majority of our work is with Facebook and its API and guidelines. During our work, we found out that we need additional permissions from FB, and have to submit the app for review. Then it turned out that FB does not provide data we need via its API and we need to find other ways to do the work.  To sum up, Facebook permissions and guidelines hindered us in meeting the deadline. While estimating, we could not go through all the APIs, data they provide, access, requests, and permissions.  Are there any cases where wrong estimates can be justified? Should the client share the additional costs with us, or can the client blame us? I know that client estimates are important, but can we present specific cases to client and protect our rights? I did not find any professional resources that address that issue. "
1517,How to split a User Story that spans multiple sprints?,"I have a User Story that contains a bunch of tasks, similar to this:     User Story: Fix any broken JavaScript in CMS    Task: Find and fix broken JavaScript in content Task: Find and fix broken JavaScript in code base Task: Find and fix broken JavaScript in static files Task: Find and fix broken JavaScript in library Task: Find and fix broken JavaScript in catalog files   So I have a bunch of tasks to go through some code and files and fix some JavaScript. Let's say that all of the above tasks cannot be completed by me in a 2 week sprint.  How do I split this up into multiple stories? The tasks can be completed in any order and are not dependent on each other at all. So there is no logical way to sub-group them. Would I just do:     User Story: Fix any broken JavaScript in CMS (part 1)   and     User Story: Fix any broken JavaScript in CMS (part 2)   That seems like a poor way to manage this. What is a better approach to this kind of problem where tasks can't be grouped any better but you still need to split the story up? "
1518,Product Backlog for Entire Department?,"I'm starting a new department as a manager, and this will be my first time having direct reports.  I have directly managed people on-and-off for the last 4-5 years, but the reporting structure has never been formalized.  I have some ideas I'd like to implement.  I will be hiring all new people (data analysts).  My experience with my current company is that everyone is overworked and priorities are constantly shifting.    Concerns:   I'm concerned my team members will get pulled into too many meetings.   I'm also concerned that we will agree to do things in conflict with the vision my boss has for our department.   I'm concerned my boss's boss and my boss have conflicting ideas about the tasks my department should do.  I want to avoid surprise in this area and flush out any and all issues on this point when I can. I'm very concerned we will overcommit ourselves (a weakness of mine).   Ideas to deal with concerns:  Department ""Backlog"" or Activity Log - I have read about Scrum backlogs, and I like the idea of having a public list of current activities viewable by all, along with a list of the next tasks we will do, with the order of priority. I have tried this in my past position, and people (above me) were downright opposed from having to log in to a system to check it, so I just sent weekly updates.  Another issue is getting my team members to buy into this.  I would like to do this on SharePoint.  I know these backlogs are usually project specific, but we are small enough that I would like to expose the entire department's log to the other departments.  Good idea?  Steering Committee - I would like to have quarterly (monthly?) meetings with my ""customers"" throughout the organization to get their input on priorities and new projects.  My boss does not like this idea.  I believe she wants to have ultimate say over the priorities, but this is complicated by the fact that she is very liberal in letting me work out tasks, timelines and projects with other teams, with almost no guidance from her.  I believe I could convince her to do something like this, but I might need to be creative about the process and the naming.  Any tips? "
1519,How to apply project management skills for different projects?,"A typical project for me is a 3 months web development and Android Apps project with a 3 person team. All development work is started and required all software development life cycle activities (planning, implementation, testing, documenting, deploying and maintenance).   Are there any rules or guidelines for tailoring the software development life cycle to different projects?  For example, when could an agile development model best be applied to initiate the project and track workflow?  Related to this, how can I better determine what can be done to improve project quality and better stay on track?  "
1520,"How to manage very small, easy tasks in Agile?","Let's say you have a bug on your website. Your developer needs to fix some CSS or something. He estimates it will take him one minute to fix.  What is the best way to manage these kinds of tasks? Do you create a User Story for it and create a task for it? The task is so tiny and minuscule that it's actually more work to create stories and tasks for it than to actually do it. This seems very inefficient, even though it's important to track and manage development of small fixes.  How do you best deal with small, one-off tasks that don't take long to accomplish? "
1521,linked tools together without micro managing?,"so I'm managing a project thats larger than my normal scope - and while I'm pretty much on my own, some tasks will be handed out to others, and I need to report nearly daily on where we are at.  Right now I have the following documents on the go:   project libre plan/gannt with a WBS list of tasks etc similar structure in a word document, where I update with ideas, links, thoughts, next actions etc for each task a word document with key points - for sharing with the boss   ... and I'm starting to get lost in constant collating of notes back and forth between these systems.  How do real PMs handle this?! :) Is there a better way?  Thanks. "

Intending to start with the following:   JIRA for issues tracking, wiki, git or svn hosting Greenhopper plugin for agile PM Bonfire for issue creation   Why JIRA? It's something myself and core team members are experienced in already and seems to be able to centralize most of our needed project tools under one platform.  I'm unfamiliar with Confluence though, Is it mainly to give an area for the business side to create multiple projects, discussions, etc? Would JIRA combined with Google Apps be the common alternative for JIRA  Atlassian's Bamboo looks to serve the purpose of automating deployments, does this integrate with JIRA's hosted svcs so that a commit can trigger a staging/production deployment with testings and reports and auto rollbacks on failures?  I believe the above JIRA and modules will be enough to start this project. Crucible looks to make code review less painful.  Does Fisheye offer much more over the built in JIRA source code browsers?

1523,Why does MS project multiply the duration of tasks?,"I've created a recurring task in MS project and I'd like to assign resources (staff) to that resource but when I add the resource(s) to the task the Work hours multiply to extremes and I don't understand why..   For example I have Project Meeting as a recurring task, it's duration is 217.13 days and the Work is set to 22 hours. However, when I assign a resource this jumps to 1759 hours. If I add another resource this jumps to 3496 hours.   What's going on?   Edit: It only seems to happen when I add to ""resource names"" rather than ""assigning"" resources. So.. what's the difference?  "
1524,Where to write ATs/UATs in JIRA?,"In JIRA, if I create a high level user story, where do I put the AT(s)?  If I put the ATs into the user story, say as text ""AT: must do blah blah"", then the user story gets split into sub tasks for the developers to work on, do the ATs need to be moved/repeated into each sub task or is it acceptable to have developers reference the parent user story for ATs when working on tickets? "
1525,Agile/scrum - tracking time spent in current iteration towards stories from the next iteration if all current stories are done,"Our team has been slowly trying to go towards agile, and like many other teams, up to this point, the question of ""what do we do when we actually finish all commitments?"" is fairly new and foreign to us. But lately it actually came up once or twice.  The reason I wanted to ask this board on good practices is that we are using Rally for agile project tracking and one thing the tool does is keep track of hours and points. In order to improve our estimates, I wanted to do something with this data and provide feedback to the team on how we did in the past, by comparing metrics that show estimated task hours vs. actual task hours vs. assigned story points.  This seems like it could work great as long as developers work up until the last day of the iteration or if they are late with their deliveries. Then ""actual hours"" reflects exactly what went into each story.  However, what should we do when we finish early but next story would take too long to complete so we can't pull it into the current iteration?  I know some people are advised to simply take the time for general cleanup/housekeeping like updating automated tests or documentation, but for sake of argument, let's say the best value to the team and the company in this specific scenario would be to immediately start working on the next story.  If we are not committed to the next story, actual hours aren't tracked anywhere. And in the next iteration when we do commit, we will only identify estimated/actual hours which will go into the next iteration, at which point the work might already be 25%-50% complete. "
1526,"On an IT project, how to manage and publicize (development and testing) environment usages?","Question: How to broadcast to the whole IT team the current and future environment usage plan, in a fluid project with constant changing priorities?  Background:  When a project is relatively small (5 to 10 people working with a specific module and with a dozen artifacts), the development cycle is relatively controlled: All stakeholders are aware of what's the status of testing in progress in each (physical) environment. It is possible to   build local ->  promote into testing environment for integration testing ->  promote for user acceptance ->  promote into PROD.    That's bread and butter. There's no need to track 'environment usage' because it's natural.  However, on bigger projects, having a controlled environment usage is a must to avoid overlaps and clashes. Assume the following scenario:   100+ developers and analysts 10 Internal testing environments 4 User testing environments 6 project 'components' (a.k.a. sub-projects with specific team leads) 9 clients (the project is 80% shared between clients, with a few specificities) 50+ artefacts 3 branches per artefact (development / testing / pre-production)   Taking into account each 'sub-project' can be touching several artefacts at once for different project phases and clients, planning and controlling such environment usage is a terrible pain.  Is there any methodology or best practice recommended for or related to control and communicate environment usage?   Is there any default view to present this to all stakeholders? Having one Excel sheet with a calendar with all the above aspects, as one might deduce, is terribly complex and hard to read for a new joiner.  Consider a physical environment as one resource, per se, doesn't address the question, since you can be operating with 1 or 9 clients at once over the same resource, as long as the development phase is the same. Likewise, you cannot have in the same environment two clients working on different development phases - as the maturity and requirements are different at each stage. "
1527,Can clients report bugs and issues into Jira without being setup as a user?,"I'm looking at implementing Jira (and add-ons) for our team to manage projects and bug-tracking. Obviously I will set the team up as Users but do clients need to be setup as Users to report bugs and issues? I can see Jira has a capture feedback functionality, but will this also create a Jira issue automatically? "
1528,Working with a Shared Resource Pool and project plan revisions,"We have a practice of saving a copy of our project plan with the status date in the filename every time we update status. This messes up the shared resource pool, because the resource pool now thinks that the updated file is ANOTHER project.  The workaround is to open the older version, remove the shared resource, and edit the resource pool and break the link to the older version(s). But this seems tedious and overly manual.  Is there a technique on the resource pool / save a copy side that can deactivate the older versions of the project, or tag two versions of the project as actually being the same project?  Or is our approach of saving backups of our project plans the incorrect workflow, and if so, what do you recommend as a safeguard against project corruption or user entry error? "
1529,"Bug fixing in Scrum, at the end of the project","We have a project that is reaching a deadline for the final production release. It's a fixed price project and up till now we've managed to work in 2 week iterations, doing regular releases to our ""inner test environment"" where BAs and people acting as POs from the client's side had a chance to have a look, give feedback etc.   We're now at the point where we have only 4 weeks to end this project and as we go to deploy the separate modules of this application to the client's environment, we've been struggling with a lot of bugs appearing.   We have some functionality to be done still but my question is - what is the best way to handle those bugs as they appear?   Since theres really a lot of them; due to project specifics, we didn't have the ability to test it on client's environment earlier. It is impossible to estimate them up front + we have only 4 weeks till the end, does it make sense to keep Scrum or switch to Tech Lead dispatching work daily to the devs directly? "
1530,Communication Among Teams,"What is the best way to communicate between project teams so that your staff feels ""in the loop""?   Context: I work in a small research center (about 40-50 researchers, statisticians, and support personnel at any one time). Our staff values communication highly, but in a recent SWOT it became clear that each project team feels isolated and has no idea what the other teams are working on. While they don't need this information to do their our tasks, the opacity is contributing to resentment and frustration.   Can anyone suggest a simple, practical way to keep our people informed? (Caveat: We are trying to avoid the dreaded All Staff meeting approach.) "
1531,Sizing an entire backlog using story points,"I'm a PM on a large multi-year project with a sizable backlog of work implementing Scrum in 4 week release cycles.  I hold weekly backlog grooming sessions with the project team and key business owners to review the user stories in the backlog, break down larger user stories (epics) into smaller ones that the project team can begin implementing in the sprint and size these smaller user stories using story points.  The use of story points associated to a user story is a fairly new concept to the team and has only been implemented in the past 6 months of the project (that started 1.5 years ago).  So, the entire backlog is not sized in story points.  My goal initially was to introduce the team to story points and to establish a regular meeting for the team to size user stories in the backlog so that they get used to it and thereby become more efficient (read faster) at sizing.  However, the team has plateaued in terms of the speed at which user stories are sized and at the current rate I estimate it would take upwards to another year to size the entire backlog.  Is this a good approach to sizing an entire backlog (that is very large) with the project team?  How can I move forward with this in a manner that will speed up the process? If not a good idea, what is the better approach to this process? "
1532,Difference in responsibilities between lead developer and project manager for support workload,"Full disclosure: I am working as a lead developer for a team of around 6 developers, not as a project manager. But this seemed like a good place to ask.  Background: Recently the team is covering more client support requests than we are larger developments. This makes it hard working with Scrum methodology (as we would normally) because we cannot plan multiple weeks ahead at a time as we may get critical support requests. For this reason we are looking to adopt kanban to manage the team workload.  My question: when working (with or without kanban) on a more support oriented workload, what are the differences in responsibilities between the project manager and lead developer?  Specific examples include:   who is responsible for managing support requests raised by the clients? Who should be monitoring for new requests/tickets and who should triage them as they come in? who is responsible for managing team workload and monitoring individual developers progress? who is responsible for setting the release schedules and which issues/tickets constitute the next release? who is responsible for prioritising the support requests between multiple customers?   P.S. I know that roles and responsibilities vary a lot between different companies, but in my company the roles seem to be slightly blurred in some areas so I would be very interested how other people define these roles.

1534,What value do project managers provide a software development team?,"What value does a project manager bring?  How do they benefit the technical members of the team who do the work (e.g., the software developers)?  Why should software developers prefer to have a project manager as part of their team?  What are some reasons that might make them lobby to hire or recruit a project manager to join their team, if they don't already have one?  How does a project manager make their life better?  Please pretend you are explaining this to a software developer (or other technical team member), and explain in language that they would appreciate. "
1535,How to decide to take a project when it's depending on a tool your team doesn't know?,"It happened to me recently, I'm kinda newbie on PMing, so I ask this to an experienced community.  A potential client contacted me through the guy (intermediary) who offered the job to me. But to define if I can do it, I need to do some pilot testing with the things that I've been asked to integrate. By doing this I could get more realistic budget, and time/work estimates.  The wisest thing I could think of is talking to the mediator to ask for the elements to do those tests, and then define if we can do this on time. It's actually doable, but depends on the team (and myself) having a time rate of understanding fast, so it could be affordable to the client. And by saying this of course it's clear I still didn't tell them my price.   Our team's usual market is web IT, and I'm asked to develop a desktop HHRR controller with some hardware control devices.  But doing this could lead to the client expecting of us to get to work, or at least give him hope of we will do that soon enough.  And last but not least; those tests require some hours of work by the team and myself, What do I do with those hours? Are they paid? Should I let it pass by putting from my pocket to see if I can take or not this project? What if the project is not worth taking and people has worked on its viability? "

1537,Heilmeier's Catechism Breakdown,"Heilmeier's Catechism is a set of questions that any research project or product development project should be able to answer to assess its feasibility.  So far I've found this example.  Specifically, I was wondering if it's possible these partially overlap:        Who cares?   If you're successful, what difference will it make?   What are the risks and the payoffs?      If you state who is affected by the project in the first point (the stakeholders), I think you should avoid commenting on the positive effects until the second point and simply mention how they are involved in the project.  In the second point, I would mention how these stakeholders would be affected (positively and negatively) if the project were a success.  The third point allows you to mention any effects if the project fails, but I think the payoffs have already been discussed in the second point.  Is this a good argument to only consider risks in the third point?  Also, the first question in the full series is:     What are you trying to do? Articulate your objectives using absolutely no jargon.   The example I provided uses technical jargon specific to neurology. If I need to use technical concepts, can I introduce them with a definition which doesn't contain any jargon? Otherwise, its difficult to describe a problem without introducing the problem domain.  Finally, are citations permitted for referencing any previous research, as well as backing any claims? "
1538,How to create an astounding innovative project plan when the information is too broad and there is short time to do it,"Maybe you remember my last question, where I asked how to leverage my internal knowledge to better handle an internal selection process for project manager. Well, in part because of that advice, I passed the first two stages of the evaluation (against a bunch of guys in the company!) and now I'm here for the last level of the selection.   This time, each of us finalists, were put in charge of real projects for software development with real deliverables and deadlines. The four main deliverables being a project charter for Friday, a kick off meeting for next Tuesday, an impact analysis on ongoing projects and a planning poker exercise for the end of the next week. The project is for a big company in the Oil and Energy industry, and is the third part of three phases for a software development project. Each one of the others phases carried out a backlog of things that were missing when we delivered them, and now is the moment to consider those again. The project has a fixed deadline of March in 2013, and there are some technical and advanced requirements I don't really understand too much (one of my evaluators advised me to not dive too deep there because is not so relevant now).  The problem now was that my priority this week was to complete my usual assignations in my current role because we have to deliver a stable release for the customer tomorrow, and everything was aggravated by the fact that I had to replace another coworker's duties as he went on vacation these days, so as today (Wednesday) I have had too little time to ask questions and to understand better what is the goal of the project, and the bosses and customers are in Germany so the time difference and their other priorities unfortunately clash making everything a little bit harder.   I only have tomorrow for solving this and doing the best of my effort to shine, so I'm here again to ask you what can be the details making a substantial difference in a project plan with too little information. The point, I believe, is to do the basic stuff but going further and propose innovative elements and impress everyone so my evaluators can be convinced I'm a better fit for the position. I personally think this selection has been particularly exhausting, hard and long but I'm really interested in getting the job so any other experienced viewpoint surely will be useful.  I only thought of, in addition to the basic sections (requirements, success criteria, team, and communication plan), expand on the methodology to explain a practical way where we could improve the metrics for the control of the progress for the project, and where we could estimate velocity and projections of completion date in a systematic manner taking advantage of tools like Microsoft Application Lifecycle (supported on TFS 2010 and better integration with MS Project and stuff like that).  What are other elements you think could make a massive difference in a project charter and, more generally, in the formulation of a project like this? Objectively, where do I have to put my main effort here?  What do you recommend it can be done to better handle this, I mean, to improve the impression for my evaluators and so on? "

1540,"When we are calculating the cost for implementing a new web application, should we have separate cost for providing the source code to the client","I am working on a new asp.net core MVC web application as an out sourced senior software developer/architecture. now i did many requirements gathering sessions with the client, and i came our with a detailed requirement and design document, which have been singed by the client. then i break-down the document into tasks and i calculated the total effort for designing,developing,testing and hosting the web application, something as follow:   Database creation and Design. 50 hours + cost 4,000 USD. Developing user registration and profile creation. 10 hours + cost 8,00 USD. Developing transaction workflow. 200 hours + cost 16,000 USD. tasks for development and hosting and UAT goes on... Final. 500 hours + cost 40,000 USD.   so the above cover the full implementation time and cost for the project. but should this covers by defualt giving the client the application source code? or this is not necessary ? and if our client need/ask the source code then we can separately provide costing for it? Now inside the contract we did not mention anything about transferring the source code, currently we only  include that there will be UAT sessions to deliver the system + 1 year warranty to cover bugs + 10% plus or minus variation/changes based on the singed requirement and design document. but we did not include any thing about delivering the source code to the client.. so should we do so? and is it normal to charge the client extra money for delivering the source code (let say 20% of the total price), beyond the implementation time in our case (500 hours/40,000USD)?

1541,Is PM considered a billable resource?,"In a software development firm that I work for, contracts are billed based on 3 items: Design, Development, and PM.  Example: A simple software project could take 200 hours and would be broken down into the following hours: 90/90/20 (Design/Development/PM)  I can imagine the profitability of the project being affected if Design and Development exceed the allocated 90 hours each. However, should it be a concern if the PM time exceeds the 20 hour mark? I mean, is the PM even considered a billable resource?  Traditionally, the companies I used to work with practice the philosophy that a PM must spend as many hours as it takes to make the project successful.  But how is this viewed from a PMBOK/Prince 2 methodology? Please note that I am not asking for a personal opinion or a poll. I would like a response that is based on some formal methodology (if possible as I'd like to make this as objective as possible).  I found a very similar question here: Should a PM also be a resource on the project? Why? From the answers there, I liked Mark Phillips' answer the best (being a 'no') as impartiality is required from the PM's perspective. However, I don't feel that that question is as specific as mine as it doesn't address the billable aspect. "

In my new organization, we are a small team of 8 developers/designers.  I heard a lot about continuous integration (e.g. Husdon/Jenkins) but never tried that, better say never needed them. For us, mentis is working fine until now.  Being a manager (ahh, my first assignment as manager), I need to continuously suggest process for better efficiency, without complicating developer's tasks. However, I'm not 100% sure if I should suggest CI for my organization, as I don't know a lot about CI. I don't want to miss better or more efficient ways of developing software, but at the same time I don't want to change the process just for the sake of it.  Can anyone please point out if using CI tools like Hudson/Jenkins will be beneficial to a small team, which already has a working process? If yes, what benefits will we get for that switch? Given the team size, is it worth investing my time to learn/try CI tools first?  Edit  Sorry for missing some required context.

1547,How to determine hours spent on a project if didn't record them at the time?,"How can I produce an accurate determination of hours spent on projects in the past when I didn't record the time spent at the time?   I used to own my own business putting on concerts in the Seattle area for 5 years. This included:   Initiating the event (event concept, date)  Planning the event (choosing venue, booking artists, renting sound, renting security, contacting investors, contacting designers for marketing materials),  Executing the event (Managing promotions team, managing production team day of show), and  Closing the event (Paying investors).    However I didn't explicitly record the exact amount of hours spent on each step for every event.  ORIGINAL POST: First time poster, I'm taking a family friend's advice and pursuing a career in Project management and he suggested that I go for the PMP certification first. Now I'm taking classes now on Project Management and I'm not worried about taking the test but I am concerned about the 7500 hour requirement (I currently have a 2 year AA degree). I feel like I meet the hour requirement with my previous business experience. I used to own my own business putting on concerts in the Seattle area for 5 years. My job included initiating the event (Event concept, date), Planning the event (choosing venue, booking artists, renting sound, renting security, contacting investors, contacting designers for marketing materials), Executing the event (Managing promotions team, managing production team day of show), and closing the event (Paying investors). So within the Project Management framework it should qualify however finding the exact amount of hours spent on each step for every event is impossible and if I were to be audited I wouldn't have anyone else that could verify my Project Management experience other than my business partners. Do you think this will be a problem? or should I just estimate my hours spent on each project (event) and go ahead and take the test? "
1548,"If someone doesn't have enough experience to get the PMP, should they get the CAPM instead or wait until they have enough experience for PMP?","Lets say someone is still in university, so they still require 7500 hours of project management experience to applying for PMP. Would it be worth their while to do the CAPM or to simply wait until they get sufficient experience for PMP?  Also, if they wish to do internships in the field of Project Management would it give them an edge over someone (a student) who has a bit more experience in project management, but no certifications?  UPDATE &lt;7 years later&gt;: So I did end up getting the CAPM in 2012 and landed an internship at Microsoft as a Program Manager. Haven't looked back since. I don't know if CAPM was the only thing that led to the internship but I'd say it probably played a role in getting me the interview. To the Answers below saying a piece of paper can't compare to experience: yes but a piece of paper + no experience is still better than no piece of paper and no experience IMO. For other students looking to get into Project / Product / Program management, I would highly recommend trying to get an internship no matter how less it pays as long as it provides good experience. If you're unable to find a relevant internship, I'd supplement it with getting a CAPM. "

1551,Small firm with 4 developers and 2 project managers in need of some guidance for project workflow,"I work as a developer in a small IT firm with 4 developers and 2 project managers. We currently implement some sort of traditional project management, in which the workflow for a given project is as follows:   Project manager gathers functional requirements with client Lead developer analyses the requirements and puts estimated execution times on these requirements. Project manager calculates project price based on estimated execution time + management overhead + some margin for error. The client agrees to the project price and is promised a deadline. The project gets developed and delivered. The client notifies us in case of bugs / need for additional features/ ... Eventually, the bug notifications/feature requests fade out.   Every project we make is tailor made to the specific needs of our client. This means that task estimates are sometimes off (it's hard to estimate a task you've never done before) or that certain technical issues only arise when we are in the middle of development. This frustrates our project managers greatly, as this usually means we overshoot our estimated cost of development and our profit margin for the project slinks.  However, the greatest frustration originates from missing deadlines which were promised to clients. This is because we have, at any given time, always 3 or more projects in active development. Next to that, the developers are often called directly by clients for questions/technical issues/emergencies. There's also the extra overhead when tasks are shifted from one developer to another, which then have to be explained to the developer that receives the task.  Every week, one of the project managers assigns tasks to the developers that need to be finished that week to meet the deadlines. Of the 38 assignable work hours per developers, 4 hours are left unassigned to account for unforeseen events. There's also a new developer that just joined us three weeks ago, and he needs some technical help from time to time which also, on average, takes about 2 to 3 hours of my time every week.  In conclusion, these 4 hours have so far never been sufficient. Communication with management, high priority bugs, ... takes longer than 4 hours every week. Management blames the developers for being unable to prioritize and says we should put more effort in making accurate estimates and actually meeting our deadlines.  My question is this: what is the right approach here? How can we better estimate the scope and duration of a project and effectively set and meet its deadlines? What needs to change?  Thank you in advance. "
1552,Retrospective templates for implementations?,"(Related question).  I have recently landed myself a product engineer role. The software product is a server based product with a front end GUI in the browser. We have a number of clients, but the product is still growing and the developers/product manager are still working on bug fixes and enhancements.  We have around 20 staff that will go out to our existing or new clients and help roll out the product within their environments.  As far as I can see, the methodology is to just go in there and get the job done.  I need a bit more experience with implementing the product outside of the lab, but already I feel there would be a lot of benefit if there was a better system in place:   Methodology (apart from the manual) to get the product installed. I.e. A tick-list on things to check before leaving the site. Retrospective (is this the right word?) for each implementation to gather what went right/wrong. This would then be shared on our internal Wiki (Confluence).   Does anyone have any good resources, such as templates, that I could use to get started? "
1553,"How can I write a project charter prior to collecting requirements, defining scope, estimating and so on?","I am trying to set my mind on the PMI rails, but absolutely can't get the order in which a project manager asked to prepare a project charter prior to steps in the planning process group like collecting requirements, defining a scope and estimating costs.  I understand that in a project charter it is only necessary to give a high-level outline of a project, not going too deep into details. But reality and past experience say that once I will write somewhere a budget $10000 and delivery time 1 month, they will stay as that, even though, a calculator feature, defined in the project charter, in a scope statement will appear as a calculator with artificial intelligence that explains why 2+2 is 4, - interactively, with illustrations.

For instance let's say we have a feature or an epic that has been in the product backlog for a while, or in the roadmap for that matter. Now it is time to put it into a sprint and hence decomposition becomes necessary. Now, regardless of the tools that is being used (low-tech vs high-tech), how do you guys keep track of the decomposition process? Do you do it at all?  For example, let's say I have a feature in the backlog that reads:     ID: 123 | As a user I want to be able to login   this will be broken down into the following user stories:     ID: 2001 | As a user I want to be informed when I input wrong credentials      ID: 2002 | As a user I want to access my dashboard when login is successful      ID: 2003 | As a user I want to be able to retrieve my lost credentials   And so on and so forth.  Is it advisable to keep the original feature (big) in the backlog and link it from the sub features (user stories) with an ID or something or can the original feature be simply chucked? "
1555,The roles understanding in the agile development / Is the PO always right?,"We have some problems in our team which I would like to describe here:   The test is almost only represented by a test in the agile team. He is entrusted with all eventualities. From planning, structuring to acceptance test, exploratory testing. The tester criticizes this massive work overload, and that for months in the retro. But there is no solution, or no solution is offered. Thus, the sense behind the retro is not given here. We also have a big difference between the Project Owner and the UX development team. Yes, it is true that the PO has to take the decisions alone, what will be done in the next sprint, whether technical orientation or UX. But does not the UX team have any rights in an agile team? How can this topic be solved sensibly, currently almost every retro drifts off.   Where do you have the role understanding within an agile development? If problems are not solved in a retro (Too little time / Too little money / too few developers) how to handle it?  If a PO can not solve the problem. Because he is offered no solution by the management. How can he then solve the role of understanding in decisions accordingly?  From my point of view, we are coming to the limit of the feasible here. Whether agile or waterfall.  Can the PO but according to a ""You make it immediately"" mentality prevail?  Even if he actually harms the team, because the actual problems (even if not his problem) are not solved?  Here are several problems:   No understanding of management for agile development A PO that does not teach management that you need more people and capacity An ambiguous view of the PO but also the agile departments. Is the PO really always right? Can the PO also decide to harm the team? The retro does not work because there are no solutions. The other major issues can not be solved.   The team feels betrayed both by the PO and by the management. This leads to angry reactions.    As you can see, it is not going well. And so far any attempt to change this situation has failed.  We tried as a team to talk to the PO and the management.  We have suggested solutions.  In one-on-one talks, we also have the chance to talk to people at eye level apart from the retro.  Maybe you have an approach that we have not thought about yet? "
1556,Prevent hourly tasks spanning days,Is there a simple way to block tasks from spanning days? I have some tasks such as interviews &amp; exams which are 2 or 4 hours long but they obviously cannot span days.   However MS project is spanning them across weekends/days. So far I've been moving them manually but is there any other way?   
1557,What are the key personality traits and topics to discuss about when being introduced to senior management?,"One of the keys to success is to start with the right foot when being introduced to senior management. How one would focus such presentation and what are the key aspects to be mentioned?  I do not want to talk about my personal life in a professional environment nor have had yet any major success in my career (which would be the logical items to cover on such intro) so I'm not sure on how to approach it. What would senior managers like to know from new joiners?  In this specific case, I'm going to have a presentation speech at my PMI Toastmasters club, a worldwide club devoted to improve people's communication skills with learning by doing. "
1558,How to wake up a team?,"I am a Scrum Master and work with a team of 7 developers + PO (also programmer). They are experienced and many of them have been work in this place for couple of years. It is a big company in a transition to SCRUM and I am their first SM (since 2 months). They are also productive, easy to work with, eager to learn and not picky about their tasks (the product is not very exciting). The thing is the ""sleepy"" atmosphere especially during the meetings. Only the PO is active - he speaks for 90% of time. When I asked him not to speak first (he is willing to change this state) there was silence and it was really hard to end our meetings with any conclusions. The guys are simply fine with everything. How do I wake them up? Or do I let them sleep and take only little actions in search for improvements? I am also working with another team in the same company and the latter is boiling with emotions! How do you think? "
1559,"Is ""Replicate X visual feature from Y app"" a valid acceptance criterion","Assume there is a graphically intensive visual feature in app X. It includes dimming out some part of the screen at some point in the program. The story revolves around implementing a similar feature in our app which is of the same genre.  The PO insists at adding an acceptance criterion, ""achieve the same exact effect as in the reference app"".  Is that a valid acceptance criterion?  How can we know that we have achieved it in terms of the definition of done?  "
1560,How will team changes impact velocity of a Scrum project?,"Question  If there are 8 members in a team assigned to complete the project. 20% of the team left during the particular sprint. Does the velocity change? If so, what would the velocity changes be?  Context  I am preparing for Scrum master certification right now. So my role would be Scrum Master. I'm concentrating more on velocity of the team related questions. Assuming that in a project, we have 8 cross-functional members in the team. Project should be completed within 4 Sprints. 2 members of the team left because they are ill. The project should continue.  I want to know if the velocity of the team changes for the current Sprint and the following Sprint. If so, what velocity changes should we expect? "
1561,Does velocity change if the storypoints are changed in the particular sprint?,"With the development team of 10 members. Project should be completed in 2 sprints. If the team plan to change the story points, does velocity of the team change? If so which type of velocity changes? "
1562,What does it mean to 'crash a project'?,"'Crash the project' is a term is used frequently in PMP materials. What does it mean exactly?  How is it related to 'compressing the schedule', if at all? "
1563,How to create a schedule for a UX process?,"I started to work on a new project ( software development) an my boss asked me: ""what are the next steps? I need a schedule!"" We're at the beginning, doing some user tests and researches about the ux and I don't have a clear vision about the next steps because it all depends.  How could I present an action plan? Should I just create a timeline of how I imagine what's next? "

1565,Should I have user stories dealing with the case where user is not authenticated?,"In my software, a lot of services expect user to be authenticated before performing.   In positive scenarios, I have this kind of context:   Given I am authenticated When I create meeting X Then meeting X is well created    I am used to write a symmetrical scenario like this for each of my services that deals with user authentication requirement:  Given I am not authenticated  //note the 'not' word When I create meeting X Then meeting X is not created And an authentication error should be thrown   It forces developer to handle check of user authentication at the top of the service implementation, to prevent any potential ""hacker"" or malicious code to call the API (in this example 'meeting creation') directly while not being authenticated.  Is it a practice I should keep? Am I right to consider this ""defensive"" scenario as a real business rule that I may discuss with ""Business"" team?  Note that my acceptance tests do not test through the GUI part, but only directly through the use cases part (services / business rules). "
1566,What are some best practices for deploying bug fixes to multiple code bases?,"Just a bit of a background, I am working to manage a big legacy system that has at least 32 branches for it's sub systems.  The challenge is how to manage and not miss required change points or defect fixes to be deployed to different branches. Currently the team has a 30% chance that the deployment is missed, and I am targeting to make this close to zero as much as possible.  I use JIRA for bug tracking and the process goes as follows:   Fixed defect/completed implementation activity is reported by a technical leader in charge to PM PM asks for expert judgement from technical leader on which branches is it necessary to be deployed Based on the expert Judgement PM reviews, creates the records and updates a deployment log similar to the following.  The created records are then assigned and processed to be implemented.   Current known problems with the said process are   Some branch deployment implementation are past the deadline when a defect is detected and gets rejected for release. This causes some fixes to have been logged in the deployment log to have inconsistencies with them, saying they are deployed but not really deployed. I am thinking of creating an additional file where these items can be tracked.  PM and technical leader gets very busy and this task of filling up for 32 branches take 4 hours (at least) to analyze and fill up. This yields rushing analysis work by technical leaders and further potential misses. Also it implies costs to the project's budget and development timeline.   My question is at what part of the process is it best to improve on? Or what points of this process needs improvement? "
1567,Time estimates and epics as releases,"My company is slowly adopting Scrum and I am doing my best to try to push us away from old Waterfall paradigms. However there are certain aspects I am finding quite hard to map in Team Foundation Server (TFS - visualstudio.com).  The challenges I have at the moment are as follows. I am quite new to Scrum so any advice/critique is highly appreciated:   Investors require dates of high level estimates for certain milestones. For example, when should we expect a MVP (minimum viable product) to be ready. However, only tasks can be measured in hours. How can I provide the investors with a good set of proposed milestone dates in this case? I was told that Ideally, we should NOT use EPICS to represent a release. But since I see no other viable way of achieving this in TFS, I created an Epic called 'Minimum Viable Product' and added the features we want there. Thoughts? Finally, I got contradicting opinions on whether operational aspects of the product development should be included in TFS or not. Things such as 'decide on framework', 'set-up development environment', etc. One Scrum Master tells me we should NOT do this because Scrum should only list product deliverable, while the other told me told me that it is obvious that these things should be there as we need to account them in the product development.   Here is a screenshot of my backlog at this point:  "
1568,"Suggestions to motivate Team Members in an ""Special Environment""?","I am working on my very first Project and act kind of the Producer / Manager or however it's called. The Project is an Videogame we're working on. It's an easy and dead Genre we're trying to revive. Because the Genre is relatively simple, we know we could make it with just the 3 or us. Even tho we plan to get an Artist on board as soon as the time comes. But that's not important to the main problem here.  Some more information until we get to the Problem: The ""Special Environment"" is, that the Project is an Non-Professional (who could have seen that one coming ^^), and at the moment Non-Payed Project. All members of the Project will be paid as soon as it is making profit. So no-one knows if he will be paid at all, cause who knows if it will ever sell. The Project should take about 12-16 months.  The main problem is that I feel like my author doesn't seem too interested into the whole thing. At least not as much as I am. We are old friends and that might be an reason for that problem. She said she'd help out and work with me, but maybe I'm better off finding someone else.  Also we just started and she didn't even had time to show up in the first briefing, so I had to talk to her afterwards, that was some days later. Now I really want to start the project, and for that I need to discuss anything important she should know with her. but she seems not to find time at the moment. That makes me wonder if I should find someone else, who's a bit more interested in that thing than her, or if it's nonsense, since the Special Environment won't get me anyone to work with me.  Also I have a question to everyone, to you have any tips for me how to manage my Team in such an environment and how much of an ""boss"" I should give? Because I really don't want to look like an tyrant, trying to force people working on the project. At the end, they might never get paid for it anyway.  How much do you think can I ask of them, without being way too harsh? "
1569,How to make team member more involved in the product,"My team's run Scrum for 1 year.   The Product Owner (PO) determine the priority of tickets and Researchers/Developers (RD) develop it.  Of course, there's still a discussion in the planning meeting, but only for how to achieve tickets that PO brought into the meeting.  Now... my boss wants to build a new product.  My new leader wants the whole team to be closer and more involved more discussion. However, as things currently are, no one speaks.  Our team has 7 RD, 1 PM and 1 Designer. It's not balanced if we wanna discuss something.  I just feel confused, so I wanna ask PMSE. Do you have any relevant examples in your previous experiences that can be shared with me, regarding my following concerns:   How to make team members more involved in the product, and keep the development process smooth? How to determine the priority of the ticket in a way that the team is highly involved? Can any team member create a ticket? How to determine if the ticket has business value?  "
1570,Is it possible to be agile during steps prior to implementation like sales and product discovery?,"How to be agile when there's a massive amount of sales / prework / product discovery to be done before actual implementation?   Speaking generally, our product is a user facing portal that displays data from multiple sources. It can take several months to display data from a new source.   The steps involved are:   business and legal agreement with the new source discovery to define how they will connect to our system building the interface/technical infrastructure negotiating about collecting analyzing and transforming the data to meet the portal standards and finally displaying it   We are trying to implement agile Scrum with JIRA and it has become a challenge.   Because this pre-work necessary to deliver value to the customer is something the customer does not care about, pre-work cannot be tracked as user stories! A consultant suggested we use tasks instead. But tasks cannot be assigned points so how can they be tracked? Should we use kanban instead of scrum? Then what will be the purpose of sprints?  "
1571,What are acceptable quality levels for various kinds of software?,"Is there any statistics or at least some industry consensus on what are commonly acceptable quality levels for various kinds of software?   I am certainly not talking about space shuttles or life supporting machines where the answer is more or less obvious. Rather, I am talking about such things as casual games, enterprise apps, e-commerce websites etc.  Again, it is pretty obvious that even with these types of apps, defects causing loss of money or similar severe consequences are unacceptable. But what about crashes,  intermittent malfunction, and defects having an awkward, but still a workaround?  Please bear with me here, as I've seen a number of internal apps that are slow, buggy, ugly as hell, but are nevertheless successfully helping to run businesses and are actually used despite all their deficiencies.   Moreover, I've seen cases where customers were intentionally not willing to pay for good quality: absence of major/critical defects was all they needed.  Of course it always helps to ask for a specific customer's expectations, but having some reference points/examples would greatly facilitate such a conversation as well as help properly plan the amount of prevention and appraisal efforts. "
1572,Should we allow people learning/considering SCRUM to our teams retro?,In our company we recently have more and more teams which consider using SCRUM. They want to learn/get a feel of it so looking how other teams work is very helpful.  They'll be joining our daily standups and probably planning meetings. The question I have is what do you think about having someone play a chicken on a team retrospective? Does it break all the rules or can this be acceptable?  In our particular case it would also force us to use English rather than the native language to have any value for the visitor. 
1573,Can planning poker in very heterogeneous teams help estimate user stories accurately?,"Picture a very heterogeneous team, where every member knows just his/her field or just a part of his/her field and very very limited part of some other fields.   Does it makes sense to do the estimation at the planning session with help of planning poker?  If more than a half of a team simply does not have an idea/clue about what it mean to implement some user story, how could they estimate it? "
1574,Does agile really promote a better work environment?,"Currently working in an agile role (Scrum Master), where the core values of agile is Trust, respect, commitment and courage.  However, I am increasingly finding professionally that I am meeting fellow agilists who are doing a similar role that pretend they embrace these values but are more concerned about power, status and have massive egos.  For example:   I've seen in my current role, individuals who like the idea of being able to make influential decisions (in the name of continuous improvement) which impact many employees careers as opposed to doing the role with people's interest at heart.  These Scrum Master's will act as team representatives and often make decisions either indirectly or directly without the team's consent.  Arrogant Agilists - one Scrum Master I work with for example gets very passive aggressive if he feels    his agile ideas are being challenged which totally goes against the idea of openess. I have also seen agile coaches who dictate and project agile 1000s of times in a patronising manner to the point people bicker about it. To then carry an attitude that if the team doesn't get it, it's not their problem and will go ahead and implement agile anyway by focusing on getting out of touch senior management to buy into it so that the team are forced to follow. I have seen agilists not fairly challenging decisions if it means it impacts their status in the company negatively. Hence, I have been the victim of agilists unfairly trying to belittle my skillset in order to influence management over and further their career within the organisation as opposed to behaving in a supportive way.   In a moral dilemma now, where I am starting to re-think management/agile as a career profession.  The moral dilemma I have, can you climb the career ladder in this profession by acting straight forward, caring, honest and fair? Does agile work to promote a better environment or is it idealistic? I got into Agile because I truly felt it was a more supportive way of working, but it doesn't seem to be translating that way in practice. "
1575,What are the techniques to elicit requirements from customers who don't understand their needs?,"Question:  How do you prevent a situation where you have to produce work-product work first and get client feedback before getting on the right track to meet their needs?  Are there any techniques to help the client and us to get a clearer sense of what she expects?  Background on what we usually deal with:  We often develop (customize) CMS for clients. First and before any information structure is the ""look and feel"" of the website, the whole ""identity"", we could even say branding.  Beyond the fact that we are wire-framing the home page with tools like Balsamiq, and ask a lot of questions like:   If your website would be a person, how would he/she look like, behave, attitude have...? What colors would you associate with your company / product / services? How is your competition, how does they website look like, what do you feel about them? What is your company mission statement, vision...? How your business model looks like, Who is your target group, What the seek etc?   All of this later on in our costumers case most of the time is out of ""their true vision of product / company / service design"".  What is more one of our customers when we started to ask questions answered: ""I need artist that will with himself find proper colours and prepare design. If he is truly artist when he will understand what mission we provide, the design will manifest from inside of him...""  So we also arranged meeting with both client and graphic that would remove any ""chain factor"", however client using world like: unique, prestigious, life saving, and giving also marketing materials provided totally other vision that graphic understood.  Graphic prepared nice modern design, that showed joy of life, product and company as happy place... As opposite to client vision (that he claimed after he saw project) as this institution has a machine that treats people and rescue life it should be: grey, sad, with attitude like at the funeral / church...  I know that we can adapt ""after"" he will provide us feedback, however this is tremendous waste of time, money and very often indicates frustration. "
1576,Ways to get client to provide information about prioritization,"When gathering requirements often clients are looking to build feature a,b,c,d,f - z. They get almost too excited about features. They almost become feature hoarders.  They want all those features. But it's hard to elicit from them what is of the greatest importance to them. They often seem to communicate this and this is important to them.  Often, a common mistake of ours is that we discover what's important to them only when the project is near mid-phase.  Are there any exercises one could do or techniques of organization to understand prioritization of their requests? Or what ways do you go about to do this before the project gets started?  I'm looking for an answer that can be either beyond what type of project management method: agile, waterfall, etc. "
1577,Best Metrics to Show the Value of Fixing Bugs,"My software development group has spent a significant amount of time recently on fixing existing bugs instead of working on new development.    Using our bug tracking software, I can get data on how many total bugs were fixed by time period and which areas of the software had the most bugs reported.  What is the most useful information I can extrapolate from these results?  I know there is a lot of material available about performance metrics, but I am trying to get ideas on which would be most helpful for this situation.  Essentially, I want to be able to demonstrate the effectiveness of the recent time that we've spent dedicated to bug fixes. For me, it's not enough to just say that we were able to fix more bugs, I want to be able to show a dramatic overall improvement in the software. For example, would it be best to measure the decreasing rate of customer complaints? If not, what is the best application of data related to software bug fixes? "
1578,Best way to handle different stakeholders?,"There are different stake holders like the quality team,client, peers, sub-ordinates, seniors. As a manager, do we need to have a strategy to handle different stakeholders? Sometimes we might not be able to be good to everyone. In such a scenario, whom we need to give priority and based on what?  "
1579,How to set a baseline for future projects based on performance of past projects?,"A project manager at our company recently supplied the team with metrics for two past projects that are wildly different from one another. Based on these metrics, the project manager would like to create a baseline for future projects however, I'm finding it difficult to grasp how that would be possible because future projects could have varying degrees of difficulty, resource availability, and other issues.  Hard Project  Sprint 3.1 to 3.6 data - 6 sprints - 12 weeks    Total Design Hours  41 Total Development Hours     250 Number of PBIs  46 Number of bugs  45 Estimate hours fixing bugs  90 Estimated hours new development 160 Defect injection rate  (number of hours fixing bugs / number of hours developing functions)    0.56 Average team development hours completed per sprint 42   Easy Project  Sprint 2.3 to 3.5 data - 7 sprints - 14 weeks    Total Design hours  12 Total Development Hours     124 Number of PBIs  20 Number of bugs  13 Estimate hours fixing bugs  26 Estimated hours new development 98 Defect injection rate  (number of hours fixing bugs / number of hours developing functions)    0.27 Average team development hours completed per sprint 18   The primary concern here seems to be that the Average team development hours compeleted per sprint is around 40-50% of actual capacity and that the Defect injection rate is too high for the harder project. But these are the two fields selected to the baseline for future projects. But what does this mean exactly? How can you arbitrarily just select the metrics from one of these projects and apply them to a future project? After looking at this question What is the best way to develop a project baseline? it looks like we might be conflating different ideas. "
1580,How to shape the demand with Kanban?,"I'm working with team working in a service delivery model. They are getting requests from the rest of a rather large organization. They don't have too much contact with the business side. We are implementing Kanban. How can they use Kanban to shape the demand? I understand how Uber shapes the demand by dynamically changing the price, but this team is not charging their clients. Are there any techniques to shape the demand in this case? "
1581,Project management and research,"What are the pros and cons of incorporating a project manager into a research team?  If anyone has any experience doing so, do you have any suggestions about how to make the program manager as effective as possible?  Often a research project has a different atmosphere than a product group.  Open-ended research is hard to plan.  You can't plan for breakthroughs, but breakthroughs are exactly what researchers are seeking.  A significant part of a researchers' time is figuring out exactly which problems to work on (or working on problems that go nowhere).  And, research is about risk; if it wasn't high risk, it wouldn't be research.  So, in some sense, research is about chaos.  At the same time, project managers seem to prefer order: e.g., carefully planned timelines and schedules and milestones.  I can imagine this might drive the researchers crazy -- and conversely, I can imagine that a research environment might drive a program manager crazy.  Also, in many research programs there is already a leader with an exciting vision who can corral and inspire folks, but who isn't necessarily the best at the nitty-gritty details of project management.  And, researchers tend to respect those who can ""talk shop"" with them and who are in command of the intellectual, substantive stuff.  So, this means that a project manager probably cannot expect to be the leader that everyone looks up to and might not be in the best possible position to tell the researchers what to do.  So, is a project manager a good fit for this kind of atmosphere, and if so, how can a project manager best add value and make the relationship work well? "
1582,How can I use Agile in a telecommuting environment?,"I'm trying to determine if there's a way to use Agile with a team of developers that telecommute. Imagine you have a team of 6 to 12 developers working often from home via VPN. How can they organize their work efficiently without meeting very often (let's say, every two weeks)?  For a counter-example, Scrum isn't compatible with telecommuting, because every day you should do a daily scrum, where the developers meet and tell what they have done, what they do and what are current problems. One way perhaps could be to use something like Skype for every meeting, but it's not the same as if you meet personally.  Could FDD be an alternative? Or is there some other procedure model that could be used? "
1583,Interview preparation tips for junior project manager position or project manager with no experiences, What kind of preparations or any helpful tips should be done/handle ahead for going in interview  for junior project manager position or project manager position? ( A person who has no PM experiences like advancing career or a fresh grad) What are the most common questions for such kind of interviews? What kind of aspects that employers focus on such kind of a person ( no PM experiences or a fresh grad) for Project Management role?   PS: Some job descriptions welcome for fresh grad for junior project manager role. 
1584,Optimal workflow for a small web development team,"I am part of a web development team in a company. We have designers and developers. The team consist of two designers and two developers. Developers are full-stack developers and are responsible for doing both front-end and back-end.   What would be the best workflow for a small web development team? Would 1 back-end and 2 front-end and 1 designer change the workflow in this case?  When doing web development, would be faster to have 1 front-end developer and 1 back-end or 2 full-stack? what do you guys think? "
1585,How to measure the productivity of a product owner in the scrum development framework?,"The primary duties of a product owner is to collect requirements from the client, manage the product backlog, writing and prioritizing the user stories and performing user acceptance testing. Considering this duties, the PO spend more time in requirement analysis and research about the new features. I feels difficult to measure the productivity of a PO in a daily basis. For example, the QA's daily work is counted as test cases and developer's work is counted as partially completed codes. But the work of PO is not counted on a daily basis. I mean that outcome is not available always.  So my questions are   How to measure the productivity of a product owner in the scrum development framework?  How to be more productive in product owner role?  "
1586,Driving process change within a company that only has recently viewed its software as a competitive advantage,"I have recently changed roles ( 4+ years ) as a product manager within an organization with previous years spent as a business analyst within a mid-sized agile software development firm and I have gone back to my development roots and have taken a job as a software developer.  Observations of the company in which I am currently employed:   Has only recently deemed the development staff and application they build and support are an investment as the product produced is a competitive advantage and not a ""cost"" Develops software with ""cowboy coding"" ways and not as a team  Legacy code (""in terms of not tested""), no CI, no project or development process, no automated deployment...etc..you get the idea   I took this job as I wanted to see if I had what it takes to bring change to the way they do things. I want to bring change and am slowly building a list of suggestions and things to try.   I haven't broken any of this to my manager yet. This actually I think will be my largest hurdle and I was wondering if anyone had any suggestions on how to broach this subject?   Do you point out current failings in the way things are done? Do you start by highlighting things to try? Do you show the value of how current practices and methodologies would not only help the team but the entire organization?   Thanks all. "
1587,Should we estimate business users' availability for an agile project?,I recently submitted my project estimations for peer review and I have been advised that we need to estimate the business users' availabilities that will be required to complete each Sprint. I was also advised that we need to agree with the same stakeholders on their availability before commencing the Sprint.  Is this mandatory? How can I estimate a client’s availability? 
1588,WIP Limits broken by low-priority Stories - What to do?,"Current Situation  Small team of 4 developers and 2.2 QAs.  I'm trying to implement work in progress (WIP) limits.  There are currently many (37) Stories waiting for QA (also 22 currently being QA'd, but that's a separate issue).  Of these Stories, some of them are an entirely new application that isn't yet live. Most/all (I haven't checked) have been merged to develop branches but are alone so could always just delete develop and remake it from master. It's possible (though somewhat unlikely) some of them are merged into develop with other work, though.  Problem  Now, as per my understanding, as per how WIP limits should work, the team should be focusing on reducing those 'waiting for QA' Stories instead of heaping more Stories into the 'Waiting for QA' by developing more stuff.  Problem is, until now, the team has been working on things without much regard to priorities. So many (~2/3) of the Stories waiting to be QA'd are much lower priority than things that are waiting to be developed.  Question  So... what should be done? I can see these possibilities, but have no idea what is the best approach:   Ignore the low-priority Stories (and, consequently, reasonable WIP limits) until sometime in the future when they can be addressed. Create some other field or column to hide the work until such time as it's relevant. Throw away the work and move the Stories back to Ready to Develop. Ignore priorities and get the work under WIP limits as soon as possible. Some solution I've missed...?  "
1589,Project Planning For Merchant-based Software,"I'm quite new to project management. I have a software project in mind and would like to manage it the correct way.   The app basically allows movie theater owners to announce their upcoming movies, schedules and such, so users of the app can be up to date and get movie suggestions.   I'm quite related to regular software project management, but in this particular case, negotiations with multiple movie theater managers and owners in order to keep the movie schedule database up to date, which can be made in two ways:    Hire people to maintain the databases up to date (expensive). Provide a web application to allow establishments to add schedules and such Foursquare-style (cheaper and wiser).   Then, my questions are: How effort, time and costs are estimated for this ""negotiation"" part? How a project like this is usually handled?  Thanks.  EDIT: I think the first option to hire people to maintain the database is expensive in terms of money and time. In terms of time because they will have to take time to ask and talk to people in each movie theater to get the updated schedules. I think the second option is more feasible because usually owners and managers have the updated information at hand and also, some other useful information they do not share easily; like offers and such. "
1590,PMP certification without having served in a management position,"I am looking to get certified in project management , however in my 20 year job history I have never held a ""Manager"" title.  I have served in an ""software developer"" , ""system analyst"" and ""application architect"" role , but never a ""manager"" . Is this a show stopper for PMP ?  Per PMP requirement one has to have previous project management experience to qualify.  I have led projects ( more of a scrum master role) before.  How do I know if this qualifies for PMP certification?    thanks "
1591,How to calculate project finish date with fixed work and different date of resource availability,"I am preparing a high-level project plan in mpp to see the top level view when the project will finish based on the resources availability and work estimation.  My requirement is as: I have an estimation of Task 1 for 365 days. Two resources are available from 3 June and three more would join in Oct. I have to see based on the work and resource availability when the project will finish.  I added 365 days in the work column, assigned 5 resources and adjust the start date of all 5 resources. But, the mpp has distributed the work evenly across all 5 resources so that first 2 resources would leave the project early and 3 resources joining in Oct work at later date. What I want is all 5 resources would finish the project at same date so it would give me project completion date. Please suggest how to do? Any other method to do without mpp?   Thanks Vibha "
1592,How can I identify quality objectives and associated metrics?,"Our project was on ENROLLMENT SYSTEM DEVELOPMENT. We are 4 members and we are adding new software to improve the system to give clash free timing to students.  Stakeholders are:   My teammates  The University   Here are the time constraints:   Project Start Date: August 30, 2012. Projected Finish Date: October 21, 2013   But the problem is that now we're having trouble approaching these 3 questions:   What Quality Objectives would be needed for the project? What metrics should we use to measure the quality of this project? What actions should we take to ensure Quality Assurance of this project?   The answer to these questions are not in my syllabus. "
1593,Organizing communication in project,"I'm going to be in charge of administration/communications in a small project (16 programmers in total including myself).  We're all fourth year computer engineering majors, and we'll be developing for a certain client using c#/silverlight. We're following a heavyweight Unified Process approach (hw use case driven model), and I need to set the communications framework and the first iteration plans. The problem is I haven't met with the client yet, and I won't meet before I need to hand in this documentation. I'm trying to be as clean and thorough/traceable as possible but I have really no idea what I need to do for the communication framework, so I'm asking what are the most important things regarding this? I figure we must have an 'official', traceable internal communications channel where we can resort in case something is not clear (i.e. dispute over responsibilities, for example I could manage a system where all official communications were CCed to my mail) but after that I really don't know what is expected of this.   I just spend some time googling, and lots of things come afloat: internal/external channels, internal communication hierarchy, etc. How am I supposed to give a meaningful answer to all this questions if we don't even know how we're going to divide the work? The only thing so far we have established are roles: administration/communication  (me), software architect, SQA, verification, documentation, UI, SCM, analysts (5), tech specialist (4).  Also, I'm interested to hear from experienced PMs for advice regarding common newbie mistakes, so I can incorporate this to my own experience without having to fail myself. "
1594,Do we need to update time estimates when we estimate based on story points?,"We estimate the issues based on story points/planning poker. My questions are:   Do we need to update original/remaining time estimates when we estimate based on the story points? If we estimate based on story points, then we need to look at the burndown chart based on story points and not remaining time estimates?  "
1595,Working with interns,"I am working in Mexico for a financial company.  Some months ago I got a task to develop all the software needed in the company.  I have a 3 person team dedicated for developing the company software. We're using Scrum and I think we are doing a good job. However, sometimes I feel I need more people in order to move faster so I was thinking about internships.  How do you manage internships? What kind of tasks should be assign to these people?    EDIT: I caught the idea, I can't use internships to accelerate the project,  I will use it to cultivate new talent instead.  My biggest problem is that in my town there are not as many developers as I wish, so it's a problem to hire talented people, and not many people like the idea to come to this town, they prefer the big cities. "
1596,Kanban on engineering dealing with customer services,"Let's say your team decides to go with Kanban, since the evolutive, adaptive and corrective work is under constant discovery, and planning for sprints is therefore not possible.  Along with that, you have a customer services team by the phone hearing the user's concerns, and filing issues in a tracking tool to our specialists team once they feel they received enough info.  What would be the best course of action to handle the fixed amount of work per state column if to make sure some issue is not happening again, the team depends on the customer's feedback (which sometimes takes ages to receive)?   That is either if customer services does not provide the team enough info to start an issue or feedback from the customer to close it.  One of my ideas was to keep a column for ""awaiting client feedback"", which should have a fixed size, and if the client does not answer in a timely fashion, the oldest of the items there gets closed as client unresponsive after a fixed timespan. But even then, we might have a bottleneck that cannot be resolved unless we remove the self-imposed limitation, right? ... Like considering the issues on that column as items out of your bucket. But wouldn't that break with one of the best added values of the framework? "
1597,Good resources on applying Earned Value Management,"Two part question -  First - I have a basic understanding of Earned Value Management (EVM), but the example I've found so far on applying seem vague. So any suggestions on understanding EVM more? I'm mainly trying to find examples on how best to calculate the Projected Value and the Earned Value (e.g. real world example showing how milestones are mapped, etc.)  Second - Any suggestions on how something like Scrum could be mapped to EVM? Thinking iterations and story points could be mapped back, but again need help visualizing it.  "
1598,How to manage development tasks and bugs/issues in a small fully-remote development team?,"How to manage development tasks and bugs/issues in a small fully-remote development team?  I've just hired two developers so I need to put a system in place for managing development tasks, reporting bugs and getting them fixed. Up to now it's just been me. We are a fully remote team.    Here's my first go at creating a simple solution (see diagram below):  There are two Kanban boards, Development/Features and Support/Bugs.  The service desk will be used by our Customer Services team and the internal users to report issues/bugs to my development team.   They may also use this board to add feature ideas etc.  Once on the service desk, any bugs can be moved to the backlog on the Support/Bugs Kanban board. All feature ideas are moved to the Features Kanban.  The app we are developing is used heavily within our company by most people.  There is also a client part that lets them login and do things.  I'm thinking I'll use JIRA (Jira software + Jira service desk) to set this up.  Is this a good solution? Is there a better way?  Some may argue that the bugs and features should be added to the same board, as after all, they are just another development problem to be solved with code.  This application runs in a highly regulated accredited laboratory environment.  Bugs have a special status and should be fixed asap.  I'd like a place to see any outstanding bugs and putting them with all the feature requests might make that harder.   "
1599,How to gather client feedback?,"I have just started as a product engineer for a web-based product that we have around 150 clients, spread out across a large country. - In short, it is a mapping application that lets you mashup your business data onto maps.  I want to kick things off by putting a survey together to get a better grasp on what they want out of the product. - This will be a 1st step, afterwards I will plan workshops and I am also looking at implementing IdeaTorrent to catalog what features they want in the product, but thats later.  I have two questions (but I think it makes sense to include them both into this one Q)  Q1 - What Questions should I be asking our clients? Q2 - What is the best platform to ask these Questions - Our organisation usually uses SurveyMonkey, and I see they have a template  for product feedback that I could use as a starting point.  I was reading an old blog post from Jeff, about how over time, cramming loads of new features into a product leads to a degradation in the product.      For every new all-singing, all-dancing feature, WinAmp becomes   progressively slower, even larger, and more complicated   This has definitely happened for our product, and it has actually been fueled from all our different clients asking for this, and we bolt it on, and now the product could do with a bit of a clean up. Therefore, although I am interested in new features they might want, I would like to try and focus their attention more to other areas such as: - which existing features do they struggle with? - how can we improve the user experience for them? - get an understanding on their workflows and where the product slows them down. etc. "
1600,"How to plan for bugs, looking for advice","I work in a software development company, where we use something which resembles scrum.   We have sprints of 4 weeks We have 6 sprints / release We plan a development per sprint, with an estimate We have a debug factor, this is the time per sprint allocated for debugging (varies per developer) We have maximum levels for our bugs   We run into the issue that when we are working on our developments, and the bugs start coming, we need to drop our development work and focus on debugging. When the maximum levels are reached, we don't release our software anymore and we need to first fix bugs before we make new builds for our customers.  This all seems perfectly reasonable, since we only release every half year and we have customers waiting for the bugs to be fixed.  However, this creates the situation where we sometimes don't find the time to work on our developments, because we have to keep debugging for weeks sometimes.  How can we plan correctly for bugs? A couple of things I thought about, but I'm curious what your opinion is    Plan bugs as regular developments, with an estimate. Don't give them priority If a developer spends it's debugging budget for a sprint, don't debug anymore that sprint and continue work on the development. Other options?  "
1601,Scrum Master role: Reporting?,"Is the Scrum Master responsible for creating reporting on behalf of the development team to drive continuous improvement?  I currently do this, and use that as a basis to improve processes.  Other Scrum Masters however prefer to get the team to solutionize the problem at retrospectives and run work shops.  What is the right approach? "
1602,Is project gamification sustainable over time?,"I haven't used project gamification so asking from a newby perspective.  I am interested in understanding how you manage and sustain this process over time:   how do you measure the success and benefits of gamification throughout the project? is it common to have a surge of interest at the beginning and then see the enthusiasm drop? if so, how do you keep the momentum going (e.g. do you update or introduce new rewards on a regular basis)? most theories of motivation widely recognize that intrinsic rewards outweigh extrinsic ones, especially over time. How do you use gamification to keep people motivated long-term?  "
1603,How can the Backlog Item's Effort field be auto calculated in Azure DevOps?,"In Azure DevOps, under the Scrum template, is there a way to auto calculate the Backlog Item's ""Effort"" field based on the summation of its child Task items' ""Remaining Work"" field?  Example:   A new Backlog Item is created. The ""Effort"" field is left empty. A new child task for the previous Backlog item is created, the ""Remaining Work"" field is set as 5. The ""Effort"" field of the Backlog Item created in step 1 is automatically updated to 5. A new child task for the Backlog item defined in step 1 is created, with the ""Remaining Work"" field set as 3. The ""Effort"" field of the Backlog Item created in step 1 is automatically calculated to 8 (the sum of 5 and 3).   How can this be achievable?  If this is not possible, how do you guys manage the correlation between a backlog item's estimated effort and its children tasks' remaining work? "
1604,Multi-task or concentrate on one project at a time?,"I am a freelancer with +15 years of experience in the multimedia design field and sometimes I struggle with the following:   I have several projects, and most of the time I can do them in a sort of multi-tasking way (like I do parts of project A, then parts of project B and so on). The problem is really when the priorities change (because of the  client asking for something else on a different project that I'm not  working at the time) and I have to swap project importance and also swap the project I was working on.  This has probably to do with ""real"" project management, since I should stick to the ""plan"" and even with a new request I should tell the client to wait, but unfortunately I can't do that, since my ""trademark"" is availability and clients love to be ""pampered"", i.e. I try to please, and if the current project can be put on hold, I will do it, and take the newer request. What I have found out is that if a project is very big, I can't really just work on it until the end, because I have other projects, but sometimes it does feel like concentrating on just one project at a time would be best, because it them would pave the way to the others. The main problem I face with the multi-task way is that sometimes I'm working on project A, but am worried about Project B or C. And sometimes I close the email, phone and any other means of comm. and concentrate on the project I feel that is stuck and was ""blocking"" the other ones, until I finish it!   Finally the question:  Is it best to concentrate on just one project? (and put every other on hold)  Or is there a better way to solve the priority swapping (and focusing on the project at hand) and achieve a nice multi-tasking pace? "
1605,Improving leadership skills for project managers,"As a project manager, what are some ways to improve one's effectiveness in leadership on a team?   Certainly it may depend on the context; but, generally speaking is it naturally the role of the project manager to lead the team ?  Also, what exactly is effective leadership in terms of projects?  "
1606,Who or what role is the owner of the agile workflow and the workflow tool (e.g. Jira),"I have worked in different organizations an they all take a different approach to the roles that own the tools for agile delivery. Can you please tell me your opinions on what role would govern the tool for an agile product delivery and why?    OK, I understand this, it makes a lot of sense.  Maybe it is better for me to elaborate on my predicament. Specifically the workflow administration is time consuming and I am receive a lot of reports of the workflow not being followed with negative impact on the project, however, there is no real ownership of reviewing the workflow, managing the tasks or the usage of the tool.  My own perspective is that this as a collaborative effort and not role specific but without a buy in on on the framework and ownership then it's a finger pointing exercise. Do any of you have any experiences where workflow, the tool and the comms around this have needed reviewing? "
1607,Make them understand we need a DMS,"I have put this in SE-PM as in my eyes, it affects Project Managers the most.  I have just landed a role as a product engineer for a software product in a mid-sized company (around 100 staff across about 6 offices).  After nosing about with the marketing, sales, support, licensing department, developers, implementation teams, I am shocked out how disconnected the whole company is, not only by team, but also by regional office.  For example - I asked for a list of all the people that have our product and no-one could give an accurate answer.  To me, that's ridiculous.   Our Sales team will go and sell the product to clients.  There will be an invoicing system somewhere, but even their prospective customers do not appear to be centralised.  The implementation team will install the product and store docco (not consistently) on office servers showing the architecture of the install and other key info.  Support team use one system, but never catalog what version of software they have or details about their environment each client has, so have to keep asking the same Qs each time they raise a call.    The license team also gets license requests for the product and these also come into a separate system.  Evaluation licenses are also recorded here, but no follow up for Sales to chase them after.  I could go on. When I ask each of the departments about the need for a centralised document mgmt system they all agree, but of course its someone elses job to implement.  I know our IT team is also messing about with SharePoint and I know we have some client information in SAP as well.  I want to know:  What course of action would you recommend I take to get upper mgmt to see how things could be improved and that this will result in happier clients and a ROI?  Does anyone have any good evidence or backup (perhaps workflow diagrams, or case studies with software like SharePoint) to help strengthen my case?  Please let me know via the comments if you need more info, or if the Q needs re-phrasing.    Edit: Not sure if it's deemed ok to edit my Q so long after asking it.  But based on your advice and some further research I have put together a document, highlighting some struggles I have had with gathering key client info, and made some recommendations on how to proceed (meeting with some key people to share notes, internal survey, bring in an expert, etc).  I was wondering if this email sounded ok, aimed at some upper mgmt:  Dear All.  Its early days in my new role as Product Specialist. I have spent much of the first week talking to the different departments and trying to find out some more information about our clients.  In all honesty - it has been quite hard to gather up some key client information - not because of people -  but because of how we record information about our clients, and how our systems are setup to pull that information out again. Just as an example, no-one can give me an accurate answer to 'Who are our clients?'  - This is critical information that should be easy to retrieve and 100% accurate.  I imagine a lot of time has gone into the design of the current systems, and they seem to work fine otherwise we would not be where we are now. I fear that I may be seen as being too critical too soon - so please bear in mind that I am new to the role, and it might just be that I need to familiarize myself more with these systems.  With that said, I would like you to take a read of the attached document which documents my struggles with answering some basic questions about our clients. - Although I am looking for answers to these Qs, the main point of the document is to provoke some discussion if we should perhaps be looking at improving how we store information about our clients. (i.e. A Customer Relationship Management system).  My main intention here is to make internal workflows more efficient, better internal sharing of information, and as a result of these = happier clients.  I hope I have not overstepped my mark putting this report together – very happy to discuss on the phone. "
1608,Definition of Project Success,"How do you define a successful project?  Is success contingent on the overall value that the product or service yielded for the organization?  If the project was successfully delivered, that is the requirements were met as specified and verified and validated by the project sponsor, and cost and schedule were met, but the product failed to meet its business case, has the project failed?  If the product met or exceeded its business case but the cost and schedule targets of the project were exceeded, has the project failed?  What if the cost and schedule targets were placed in the 30th to 40th percentile, and the actual results were in the 60th percentile, has the project failed?  If so, if the same project had targets placed in the 80th percentile, but actuals came in at the 70th percentile (10% greater than the first example), is this project a success?  If a project was delivered successfully by all accounts and the business case return was not expected for five years, if after the five years the organization learns its expected return was not met, is the PM and team accountable for that? "
1609,Project Scoping Document,"What type of details typically go into a project scoping document?  Also, how much detail should you go into? Since, the requirements are still being decided upon?  Update:  The project scoping document usually is provided to the person doing the decision-making on the client's side. Typically, this could be the marketing director, and in some cases the president. "
1610,Who should manage a project that is used to build a product?,"Using Scrum, the Project Manager role doesn't exist. The Scrum Team can build a product by itself. Essentially, the Project Manager's tasks are more or less divided between the Product Owner and the Scrum Master.  But what happens when in addition to a product, you also have projects? By that I mean that a product is built through multiple projects.  For example, client A and B are both paying for product 1, with different deadlines and priorities of course.  Does the Product Owner of product 1 should manage the scope date and budget of project A and B?  Is it a good place to introduce someone who has the role of a Project Manager, to manage project A?  If not, what happens when there will be too many projects to be handled by Product Owner 1?  If there is a Product Owner for each project, they aren’t real PO because they don’t have power over the product they are delivering.  Another example of a similar situation that could require a different answer is the following: Let's say a service company business model is to build websites for clients. They build a website, ship it and then consider that product to be done. But at some point, they decide to build a ""website builder internal SDK"" to accelerate future websites development. I'm sure we agree this ""SDK product"" is worthy of its own Product Owner and whole Scrum Team.  Should each service be under the responsibility of a Product Owner that manages the dates by talking to the ""SDK"" Product Owner? "
1611,How can I convince my team that they delays are inevitable and that they need to hustle in order to actuall get done on time?,"Sometimes I have teams that think there is little point to being ahead of schedule. I try to convince them that things will inevitably come up that will take up precious time to sort out, so we need to hustle, as described in The Mythical Man Month. They understand the need to finish on time, but not the necessity to work harder than necessary to do so even if something goes wrong.   How should I convince them that hustle is important? Should I yield to their stubbornness and let things proceed on schedule, but not ahead of it? Is it okay for a manager to allow their project to progress such that they would not have enough time to deal with any minor catastrophe and still finish on schedule?  (Feel free to give software-specific answers, but I'm looking for as generic an answer as possible as this isn't a software team.)  "
1612,What questions would you recommend to ask to a potential employer for a project manager role?,"My current role is more on IT operations but there is a lot of overlap between operations and project management. I am looking for a project management role and looking a company that is better fit than my current company, and trying to see if the role is a better fit for learning more project management than my  current role.  I will be having an interview for a project manager role. I wanted to see if I am a good fit for the company and role. We all know that those companies have different definitions about project management. How would I know if the company is a better fit for learning more project management? What SPECIFIC questions should I keep in mind to ask the employer? "
1613,Using probability to assess issues,"In risk management within projects, probability is used as a way to understand how likely risks are to happen in the future. This is obviously a well-established area.  Presumably there is nothing limiting us from applying the concept of probability to issues [risks that have materialised] that could have happened in the past (where uncertainty exists in whether the issue did or did not occur).  As an related example, I may believe that our organisation has been subject to a cyber attack within the last week. However, we haven't observed this attack happening directly and so we have to build up a picture of whether or not it happened based on information we uncover. It seems appropriate to me that I can take and apply the concept of probability and therefore assess issues in the same way I assess risks.  Does this logic seems permissible? Is this how people think about issues within their risk management? "
1614,How to deal with the similar deliverable in my impact map?,"I'm tasting specification by example in my project e-Travel. It's a simple project about travel expenses reimbursement.  1. The flow is simple：   Employee does business travel by assignment. When he returns, the employee posts a claim for the expenses paid and subsidies. Then the accountant verifies the claim, and calculates the expenses and subsidies. Finally, the cashier pays to the employee by the signed claim from chief.   2. We get out two business goals and draw two impact maps:   Employee gets expenses in 5 days.  No fraudulence or mistake happens.    3. Now, I'm not sure the deliverable for the cashier.  I think that the printing check or preparing fields by details of claim should also speed up the payment.   So, should I repeat them in the first map or create a link? Otherwise, the duplicate is not necessary?     I know the question is so naive. But as a newbie, I need more guidance. Thank you! "
1615,How to combine continuous delivery cycle with iterations?,"I'm the leader of a small team (a few programmers, plus product manager) practicing continuous delivery. The development stages for features are:   Coding: A programmer prepares a branch with the feature, up to a specification. The feature is reviewed by Product Manager at the end of this stage. Code review: Implemented with merge requests. A fellow programmer looks at the code, points out issues, programmer works to fix them. When everything is OK, the feature is integrated to main development branch. Deployment: after passing the automated tests suite, the contents of main branch gets pushed to production servers. This currently happens twice a week.   For planning our work, we're using 2-week iterations - Product Manager proposes feature to work on, we estimate them, and based on that allocate them to programmers for the iteration. My questions are:   During an iteration, what should we commit to? Right now we're saying that by the end of iteration, the coding (stage 1) has to be finished. This is because there might be some delay between coding and review (since the reviewer is also working on something).   I'm a bit hesitant to include all 3 stages as required to finish, because this means by the end of iteration, everyone is working on code review, instead of the features following their development cycles unconstrained. How much should be planned regarding delivery date? With the current setup, we can only say that the feature should be deployed sometime during the next 3 weeks (iteration + a window for code review and deployment). Can we do better? Should we? Because of the above: how much should we plan regarding work ordering?   Should we, for instance, say during which days which features will be worked on, and reviewed? Or specify a strict order in which the features will be worked on during an iteration? Or give the order as priorities, but allow more freedom?  Again, I don't want to constrain the programmers too much here. Detailed up-front planning doesn't sound very useful for me, and the actual ordering of work is something I'd rather give freedom at as well (perhaps with the priorities as a soft guideline). But I'm not sure if that makes the delivery date much more certain.  "
1616,How to move towards Scrum when we don't really seem to be able to fit into 'The Scrum Guide'?,"I have previously asked a question on PM, which was not well focused, but I still received some useful tips. I do plan on putting some of the notions in front of my manager, but I would like to re-approach our issues here to see if I can't get any more insight.  I work for a mid-sized American company (300ish) on a very small, not officially/organizationally recognized development team (3). Only one of us has a degree in CS (and it isn't me). Our manager is an manufacturing engineer and has negligible experience programming, designing software, or managing a development team (except for the past two years of our 'covert developing'). On top of this, our developer with a CS degree tends to work on projects solo, separate from the other two of us.  We have an insane amount of projects our manager is looking to achieve. Essentially he is hoping to digitize most of our Quality &amp; Inspection processes &amp; paperwork, all the way to semi-automating our PPAP/PFMEA documentation. Frankly it is all way more than is chew-able by such a small, inexperienced team (in any sort of respectable time frame), in my opinion, but I admittedly tend to have a 'glass half-empty' attitude. So far our extended time frame hasn't been an serious issue to our company's President. Half of the projects are very large... our current project has more or less taken up about 70% of overall work-time for two of our developers, and has taken 2 years to develop, and still going (we had to restart the architecture and include unit-tests because we didn't know what we were doing when we started).  Now, our manager (who, to his credit spends a lot of time reading on relevant subject matter to try and understand our position as developers better) wants to try and work under a Scrum framework. I have taken on the role of Scrum-Master, our manager as Product-Owner, and of course the other two developers are... developers. Other mgmt. and our President would be the 'shareholders'.  My main issues that I am struggling with, and unsure how to approach are:   Our 1 'team' actually consists of two separate development teams working on unrelated projects (mentioned in second paragraph) and either team can, currently, get our priorities changed independent of the other team's priorities as well. This seems like it should be 2 separate scrum teams but our manager/PO does not have the time for that, and I don't think I have the mental energy for it, currently. Also, how are we supposed to be accountable as a team for separately developed projects? Projects are all essentially interwoven into the same 'suite' and our projects kind of have blurred borders/edges. Even if we break projects into hard-defined boundaries... the projects are still quite large and our product backlog could be too much to navigate if it is fully populated Fully and accurately populating the product backlog seems daunting, as often times 'case-scenarios' are often overlooked by shareholders in favor of 'the ideal interaction' or they state outcome but struggle to define how to get that outcome even on paper. Sometimes processes get such a vague description such as : ""The quality tech would look up the relevant specification and make sure the document conforms""... which you can't turn into programmable logic on its own, we aren't making magical PDF parsers. More on the previous point: Getting vague, generalized process outcomes from shareholders has required us to go and talk to individual employees that actually do the paperwork, often times the nuances in their process will slightly deviate the generalized mind's-eye picture of the shareholders, which then often triggers long, grueling conversations where we as the developers are just trying to get the shareholders to understand what we need to know and why we need to know it... this seems incredibly anti-Scrum and I don't see how we are supposed to essentially design an enterprise-level software-suite if we have to re-explain why we need to understand case-scenarios and the nuanced details of the process every time we outline a new software behavior. Is there a way I can get non-programmers to understand our needs better? Especially when I have a hard time outlining our needs because we are trying to digitize processes that often rely on 'tribal knowledge' We lack personnel to be able to handle documentation, training, and maintenance (we often have to drop development work to handle these ""fires"" as they come up) EDIT: some of my other points kind of speak to this, but how granular/detailed should a PBI be? Do all PBI's have to be finishable within a sprint? Also, can Scrum Planning, Review, and Retrospective be held without any PO or Shareholders if none of them have time?  "
1617,Scrum Sprint Review without the stakeholders,"I am working in a pretty small startup and we've just started doing scrum. The team consists of me as the scrum master (but also a developer), the product owner which is also the owner of the company and 5 other developers.  Today we had our first Review and it felt a bit wrong to me. Because we didn't have any Stakeholders to show the results. There is nobody else interested in the process of the project which I could invite to the review.    So the review was actually a meeting where we were showing the finished backlog items to ourselves. Does that make any sense?   I mean not every developer worked on all stories, so for some of us it was good to see the end result of the other stories.  But the actual goal of the review should be to get impact and ideas from the other stakeholders to improve the backlog, right?  I wouldn't say the meeting was totally useless, but almost. Any suggestions how to handle this and how the review should look like without stakeholders? "
1618,Why use hybrid Scrum and XP?,Why is the most common Agile software development approach a hybrid of Scrum and XP?  Why do you think its a good idea to use them together?  (if I am not aloud to ask for opinion based question please lock or delete this thread thanks) 
1619,When is using a Kanban(-like) board with paper tickets okay?,"At some point our project manager (PM) switched to a Kanban-like board (we have ""Open"", ""In progress"", ""Verification"", ""Feedback"", ""Analysis"" and ""Test"" fields on the board; our project follows (I think) the V-model that is we do a lot of testing along with the implementation of features and bug fixing). Since I joined the team after this was introduced it's all I know from this project.  As time went by I found it more and more problematic to work with the way things are because:   the client has their own ticket repository (Polarion from Siemens; no matter how many ""awesome"" features it offers it is, in my opinion, an incredibly broken/incomplete pile of junk) we have our own Redmine (digital tickets :)) and board with tickets on paper   The way things currently work are:   Client finds an issue and creates a ticket in Polarion Our PM (or someone from the dev team) looks through the opened tickets If a ticket suitable for us is found (that is, its category is Software), the following needs to be done:   Create Redmine ticket Create paper ticket and hang it up on the board in ""Open""    In addition we have two members of our team who work remotely which means that they have to ""bother"" someone to create the paper version of the ticket and manage it on the board in their stead. Our PM tries to do it but it's not working so well to be honest.  To add more to this we also have internal tickets that represent problems that our client hasn't found yet (might never do) that we keep away from Polarion since the client has no access to our Redmine. Posting a ticket number to a ticket that is not visible for the other party doesn't make much sense.  All this was bothering me at the very beginning (I like taking notes on paper but not managing that paper) but it became worse when we had a couple of big waves of tickets shipped from Polarion most of which weren't reproducible (hence had to be hung up in the ""Feedback"" category on the board and in Redmine). The more tickets we had on the board the more difficult it became to find anything. Me and my colleagues sometimes spend several minutes to find the given ticket (my personal record is approx. 10 minutes), which is not only a waste of time but as you probably imagine incredibly frustrating. If you are unlucky enough the ticket might not actually be present on paper because someone forgot to do it/was not able to (like the two colleagues who work remotely).  This stacking up of tickets with status ""Feedback"" led to the creation of a new process - we now have a separate from the board pile of tickets on paper that are not reproducible and require a different type of feedback (the normal ""Feedback"" in our project is when we require more information on the specification) - Dear client, please don't post a screenshot and say it doesn't work as expected while at the same time the screenshot is not even of our own software but of a third party tool that you use for the simulation of the system (and we don't have) or ""Dear client, please read your own specification..."" etc.  And of course we always have to work with the paper tickets too. I always create Redmine tickets when I find a bug, document everything and basically take care of the digital side of the ticket system. However sometimes I forget to create a paper version (it's not just me, happens to many others too) which annoys the hell out of the PM.  I'm interested in the general practice out there (I don't have much experience to be honest) when it comes to ticket management on paper. Is it suitable for big projects at all (we are 11 people and work for more than 2 years on this project; tickets on papers is something we have for a couple of months now)? When is it time to say enough with the paper and move to digital-only medium? "
1620,When developing the same app for multiple platforms how do you keep the implementation aligned,We have an Android native app and now want to build an iOS native version. We work scrum / kanban process. How best can we ensure that the Features / User Stories implementation on both versions align? We use webservices so they will share that as their common backend which is good.   How do you keep the iOS and Android developers on the same page? What other practices help you ensure that a feature / user story is being implemented the same way on both apps?  What are standard practices? e.g. Do you duplicate the post-its for a user story and mark one post-it as android and the other as iOS? or what?  p.s. the android and iOS developers will be different individuals 
1621,How to represent tasks with subtasks over versions?,"I have tasks T1, T2,...TN. Each task has subtasks S11,S12,...,SNM. Each subtask takes some amount of time.  For version V1 I have t1 months, for version V2 I have t2 months,... For simplicity I assume that all subtasks can be done simultaneusly.  How can I represent these task in a way similar to the picture below? This would enable to see which subtasks need to be in V1 (here it would be S11, S21, S41 and S42. S12 and S31 might make it into V1 but probably only into V2).  Of course, the tasks and subtasks have real names and a change in the duration of a subtask should be easy (at best, just editing a number).  Can this be done with Ms Project? Is there a better way than Excel as done for the picture?   "
1622,Transition from waterfall to agile,"I'm not a PM but a senior designer. My current place of work follows a traditional waterfall process and currently it's throwing up a whole host of problems.  I'm aware we need to upgrade our processes and work in a more agile fashion though I'm unsure how best to integrate it.  If you're working on a site redesign, is it a case of working in sprints to update the homepage, page x and then y? How does this sit with clients?  I appreciate this is a pretty big topic to cover and I don't want to be the one dealing with implementing it but I am curious. "
1623,Making Retrospectives Effective in a Long-Running Project,"I'm a ScrumMaster for a software firm, and we have a project that is entering its 35th Sprint. While I appreciate the value of Retrospectives, it's becoming progressively more difficult to get good insights from our Retrospective events. We have shortened the meetings to avoid wasting a lot of time, and even the short meetings don't seem to get as much content (or quality content) as they used to.  I'm wondering what strategies the good people of PMX use to continue to get value out of Retrospectives, even for a very long-running project. Are there different formats that you use as a project goes on longer and longer? What insights should we be looking for later in a project? Do you stop doing Retros altogether?  Thanks for any insight! "
1624,"Sprint Demo, Retrospective, and Planning sequence with offshore team","For the time being, we have a large offshore development team that mostly takes instructions from the California team. It’s like having team members that can do 30 hours of work per day. I’m trying to schedule Sprint Review, Retrospective, and Planning. Because India is a half-day ahead of us, I feel compelled to narrow the gap between Review/Retrospective and Planning, so that offshore doesn’t have an unplanned day to start every sprint.  So, question: are there any hard-and-fasts you go by on the sequencing of these meetings? For instance, Sprint N+1 Planning the day before Sprint N Demo/Retro would fix my problem, but is probably a bad idea. And having Demo, Retro, and a Planning all on the same day is exhausting. But I have to compromise on something. Your recommendation? "
1625,Need task to ignore schedule,"I have a situation where we will be doing a conversion over a weekend in order to minimize impact to the company. Additionally, this task should be delayed until 3 weeks after a predecessor task. What are some ways to handle both of these together?     I have indicated that this task should use the 24 hour calendar I have indicated that this task should ignore the resource calendar In doing so, I have had to indicate that the lag from the predecessor needs to be 2 months in order to get the date of the subsequent task pushed out 3 weeks.    Is there a way to keep from having to use the 2 month lag? The date ends up right, but my OCD starts twitching for having to indicate 2 months for a 3 week spread. "
1626,An agile approach with a waterfall delivery and the QA impact,"My customer signed off on a major enhancement to an existing application.  The enhancement will be delivered as a single new release and I can't change this. However, how we get to this final release is in my control and I'm thinking we could still benefit from a sprint model.  My goal is to break down this large chunk of work into smaller user stories / tasks and hold sprints as we work towards the release, which is several months from now. My team is familiar with agile methodologies, and I think it will help us define the work, split it up across our team, build momentum, etc.  The area that is not clear to me is when to test. Normally, we would fully QA each item within the sprint, but with so many changes going into the application and the absence of UAT until all the work is done I'm not comfortable relying on testing that was done months earlier before handing it off to the customer.  Does anyone have experience with a similar approach? When is it best to test? Should I keep a traditional waterfall testing phase, test within the sprints, or is there a hybrid approach that is suitable?  "
1627,Why are my calculated spans slightly less than my durations? [MS Project],  I calculated the span based on my start and finish dates to double check the file.  Why are these two columns not equal? Is there a setting wrong somewhere? Does this mean my end date isn't being accurately calculated? 
1628,Project manager in scrum and communicating with the customer,"In my current project I'm very confused about my role and who I should go through in regards to getting information about requirements/stories and who I ask questions from.  Project team:   1 x Project manager (this is the main role I'm confused with).  Also acts as Scrum master 1 x Team lead developer 3 x Developers (I'm one of these) 1 x Tester   NOTE:  I don't think we have a project owner as such but if I had to guess I suppose it would be combination of our Project manager and the clients project manager.  Project steps to date:   Project manager met with the client to identify initially project scope Project manager and two developers met with the client to further discuss scope Project manager worked with client to identify stories and prioritization Project manager discussed stories with development and asked for estimation  The PM needed this as the client needed a quote for the work  Development team estimated stories but also had questions which Project manager took back to client (This occurred a couple of times)  Project manager and development lead met with client a few times to discuss work/questions as well as future work. Rest of team members started development work.  Team lead was stuck on other projects  for first sprint only attending client facing meetings.  Team lead decided which stories each developer would do and assigned them at the first scrum. After assignment of tasks developers started developing  Towards the end of the sprint the tester started working on Acceptance criteria (tester did not work with programmers at the beginning on creating these which I thought strange?). On completion of a task the tester tests the story and assigns back to tester if not complete.   This is the part as well I'm getting confused with especially:   When a developer has a question about a user story they have gone back to the project manager who has then contacted the customer contact person directly   We did not complete anything for the customer after the first sprint, and we are yet to start the next one.  So my core questions are:   There seems to be something wrong with our approach to agile here.  But as I understand agile is all about being agile and favoring people over processes, maybe we are just flavoring it to suite our clients needs? Should developers contact the customer representative directly, or should we do it through our PM?  This I have found hard because of things like ""questions lost in translation"" and ""time delay in getting answers"".  It's a good point that one of our developers English (not saying they are not a good developer) is not that good so maybe this is the reason we have gone down that route?  "
1629,How to add new activities from the contract modifications into Schedule,"Initial Project Schedule (IPS, or Baseline schedule) had been approved. Several monthly updates were approved. The owner has requested KTR to incorporate a score (20) of new activities from the contract modifications into the schedule, with contradicting directions, i) first, ""all twenty activities at once"" ii) then later, ""just new activities that falls into the duration of the monthly update this time (and repeat the same for the subsequent updates.)""   It looks like if I do ii) 'only the relevant activities for the update duration', I would lose opportunities for time extensions that I would surely be entitled to get if I do i) 'all at once.'   Is there an industry standard in reflecting new activities added from the contract modifications?  Can I insist to go with i) and how can I convince them?  "
1630,Developers don't like to estimate. What can I do to improve the process?,"I have two kinds of projects:   Agile where estimates made with story points using planning poker [website]Waterfall/Kanban where estimates made on hours/days divided to specialty. Like FE/BE/QA/DevOps/Designer/PM e.t.c.   The problem is that a few developers don't want to give any estimates using either method. Neither personal time estimates nor depersonalized relative story points. Sometimes there are even tantrums around estimating or they take sick leave on planning day. If I have several of devs they will wait until senior devs provide estimates on their own. QAs don't want to participate at all despite the fact they are developers too in all meanings.  What I have tried:   Give them time to check stories and specs Let them investigate issue with hands-on code Customer and PO always on planning meetings to answer all questions Each story has use cases, mock ups, scribbles, designs Every story decomposed to minimum valuable size when Agile or not less than 4 hours not more than 8 hours when Waterfall There is no personal responsibility for estimates or penalty/blaming for underestimating   What techniques exist to alleviate this problem? What more can I try? "
1631,How many developers do we need? How much time?,"We are currently using Scrum and we are evolving into Kanban. At the same time, we are starting a migration from version 1 of our underlying framework to version 2. There is a target date of January 1 for this migration to be complete. This date is not exactly set in stone, but it's a goal that we'd like to meet in order to add new features before our busy season next Summer. Right now I'm trying to figure out how much development effort that will take.  I'm all for the ""decide late and deliver early"" approach of agile, but I need to figure out if we'll need more developers and how much work it will take to complete this project.  What are some metrics I can use to figure out how much development work will be required for this project? How does this work with Kanban? "
1632,Principles of modern quality management and their repercussions,"Hi everyone I'm looking for some help with my upcoming exam, I'm struggling to think of answers relating to quality management..  A question on my previous project management exams goes like so: ""Modern quality management requires customer satisfaction, prefers prevention to inspection and recognises management responsibility for quality. Explain, with examples, why each of these is important for quality management. What problems would you expect if these aspects of quality management were ignored?""  What are some examples of why these things are important? And what problems would you expect if these principles were ignored?   I can think of one: Inspection of produced units would take much longer than assuming prevention.  But otherwise, I'm struggling. "
1633,When (if at all) is it okay to break the WIP limit?,"Let's assume that I have a kanban board that has a ""Test"" column with a WIP limit of x. In the general case, I should not add a card to this column until there is a free space -- at least one card has moved to ""Done"".  Instead, I should give as much help to whomever so that the card currently there can be progressed so they move onwards.  Now, in our case, we have to wait for hardware so no matter how many bodies, as long as the hardware is not ready, we cannot progress this. The way we deal with this is to have a limitless WIP swim lane that hold such stalled cards.  Is this reasonable?  Is there a better way? "
1634,Can an inexperienced person be a project manager?,"What is the value of experience in a role of a Project Manager (Technical Manager).   The problems I am facing is:   During assigning tasks I do not know about dependencies. I have to rely on what my developer says. I do not know how to set a project time limit. I do not have skilled team members.   Higher management forces us not to work but only manage. Will this job fit us as 1 year experienced Post Graduate Computer Guy? I need some advice from people who has experience in this field. They can guide me in proper career building.  If a person is having graduate degree and if a person have a post graduate degree, does it mean to make a person manager even though he/she does not have experience in project execution? Is management dependent on experience? Is management dependent on degree? Should I consider ""A good coach may not be a good player"" or should I first grow my technical skills? "
1635,Should bug fixes be deployed as soon as they're ready?,"I'm changing the development methodology in my team. When I joined the company, there was no methodology whatsoever (basically, patch 'n' deploy) and in consequence we have 400k of spaghetti unmaintainable untested code.  I proposed a look into the Agile approach, and a we're doing a (quasi-)Scrum approach. Several months passed from the day I suggested releases based on sprints (rather than 3+ releases per day full of bug fixes) to the day my manager saw the benefits of this per-cycle release approach.  However, (since we have no tests nor QA and the whole thing is a legacy monolith, and) since we're mostly doing bug fixes (23 bug and UI-fixes, 2 User Stories last sprint) my manager feels it's weird we have to wait till the end of the sprint to release all those bug fixes.  I come from a background where we're usually backed up by automatic tests, and since we barely have to deal with bugs (1 or 2 bugs per sprint), we see no harm in deploying them along with big changes (like 4 or 6 user stories). So, since that is not the case in this company, should bug fixes be deployed as soon as they're done? Or should we deploy them at the end of the sprint along with the new features to maintain a commitment? "
1636,"S Curves, Comparing where you should be and where you are","If you are using Earned Value, you can create an S Curve that shows your planned value across time.  As you add actuals and take earnings, you can show the AC curve and EV curve and compare it visually with the PV curve, as well as calculate your indices.    If you are not doing Earned Value, is there way to create similar curves using Work values instead in MS Project?    The project is an IV&amp;V type effort where the vendor is contracted firm fixed price.  As such, true dollar values will not be known to the IV&amp;V vendor.  Only schedule data is visible.  The schedule is baselined and they are capturing work percent complete as their method and finish variance is known.    Thanks for the help.  Julie?? "
1637,Planning poker on virtual teams,"I'm looking for a way to make it easier to perform planning poker on a virtual team (i.e. a team that is not co-located with one another).  Requirements for a successful planning poker:   Since we're distributed, how can I do something that works well with a phone conversation? I want to make sure this is easy for everyone, as in Easy to use - get in, get the work done, get out. I don't want to have to track story details.  We'll have a discussion going on over the phone. Another challenge we face is people are on multiple platforms, such as (i.e. desktop, mobile, tablet, Windows, Mac, etc.)   The obvious answer here is the tool found at Planning Poker, but this seems a bit heavy for my needs.  I don't want to make my team members sign up for an account and entering the stories seems like a bit too much.  We've tried things like holding chat sessions online with everyone, but the process gets a little biased by the fact that other people can see the inputs of others.  What else could I do to hold a successful planning poker session with virtual teams? "
1638,Handling bugs in Kanban (using JIRA),"When we have features, we usually break them down to tasks that take about 1-2 days. Usually our dev tasks are not ready for QA as soon as a developer finishes developing them, but only after the whole feature is ready. That means that a few tasks (and probably a few features) would already be finished by the time QA will start testing the version. We usually try to decide ahead what bugs/features the next version for QA will have.  So, When QA open bugs they won't be directly correlated to a specific dev task but more to the feature as a whole.  Moreover, our QA usually test features based on their own test plan, which is not directly connected to our development tasks on JIRA.  One possible solution for this issue, is to have all tasks belonging to a specific feature, opened as subtasks under that feature. When each subtask is finished, mark it as resolved. When QA starts testing the feature, they will open bugs under that main feature (I can link the bugs to the main feature I guess), which will go back to the 'In development' stage, till all bugs opened on it are resolved.  Another option, is to have all subtasks of the main feature as resolved, but have the main feature stays in an ""Waiting for QA"" column.  I will move it to done only once all bugs on it are fixed.  Which solution is better ? Do you see any downsides or ways to improve that process ?   My goal is to be able to confidently say how many tasks we manage as a team to finish in week/month time(or what is the cycle time of an issue) so I can more or less know once we break features into tasks, how long it will take the team to ship them.  As far as I'm concerned, finished also means verified by QA. I want to find the best way to handle our current process. "
1639,Should a Product Owner be present for all retrospectives?,"We have a Scrum Team of a Product Owner and four developers (one of whom is Scrum Master), running one week sprints. As per Scrumguides.org (emphasis mine):     The Sprint Retrospective is an opportunity for the Scrum Team to inspect itself...    So that includes the Product Owner.  Following the advice from Agile Retrospectives by Derby/Larsen we're trying to focus our meeting on one specific topic. We have iterations of one week, so we usually cover only one topic each week.  Now, at least half of our Retrospectives will be very tech-oriented: talking about how to spread technical knowledge between us and other teams, improving automated testing, trying new tools, et cetera.  Our Product Owner is not very technical at all, and will not be able to contribute all too much in this kind of Retrospective.  Any suggestions on how to deal with this? Do we do those Retrospectives with just the development team? Do we ""need"" to look for ways to include the Product Owner too? "
1640,Should test phones be taken home or kept in the office?,"My team consist of 6 backend developers, with 4 different test phones and tablets.They need to use test phones to cross check front end developers work, and debug their API.  Testing in mobile is about 10% of their workload.  Should I let them take the test devices home? Or put those devices in office and let those who need to perform testing to take the device? "
1641,What Questions do you Ask the User to Elicit Requirements?,"I was reading:  Instead of asking, “What do you want?” or even “What do you want the system to do?” an approach based on usage and user goals asks, “What do you need to do with the product?” Your users might not be accustomed to a dialogue of this nature.   And I come to PM.StackExchange to ask this question, what questions do YOU ask your users and stakeholders to find out what they want and need? "
1642,Hiring new team with limited resources using Scrum,"My team consists of 4 people   Myself (Division Director, Senior Developer and Project Manager (adhoc PM)) Emp1 (Data Administrator/Data Entry for entire agency) Emp2 (Junior Developer - Have not hired yet) Emp3 (Assistant Salesforce Administrator / Assistant Developer - Have not hired yet)   Overview:   The agency I work for consists of 7 divisions. My division (Data Services) is responsible for Data Collection, Data Entry, new Development, and maintaining existing web applications (total of 5 sites including Salesforce for 70 users). I'm currently the only one developing, maintaining, and administrating all sites including Salesforce. I'm also the one responsible for all of my staff and can put together any kind of team that I need, but with only the resources for hiring 3 employees.   Why I want to use Scrum:  I want to put together a Scrum team because our projects change often, and randomly due to politics. So, with traditional management I found that I was starting over and wasting a lot of time re-writing requirements only to have them change in the middle of development.   My Issue:  With the resources listed above, can I successfully pull off a Scrum team? The reason I'm concerned is because I'm the one juggling the Scrum Master role, as well as Salesforce development, .NET development, and managing my staff. Granted I will have a Junior Developer and Assistant Salesforce Admin, that will take some time to get them up to speed.   So to sum it up, is this possible without jeopardizing conceptual control? What I mean by this is; with the types of resources and non-dedicated Scrum Master (since I also have a few others roles) am I high risk for failure approaching using Scrum? "
1643,Is Scrum updated to 2.0 or 3.0?,I've found on several sources that people claim that there is Scrum 2.0 or even 3.0 like in here [website]Although it's not officially confirmed anywhere.   Is there any Scrum 2.0 or 3.0? If so where can I find well defined and reliable guide for it? 
1644,How to write implementing HTTPS as a user story?,"The title sums the question up pretty well. How do you do that? Should you even make implementing HTTPS a user story?  I thought of:  ""As a page visitor I want all communication with the service to be secure so data integrity is kept"". Sounds pretty dumb if you ask me. The other way around would be:  ""As a technical manager I want web page access to be secure so that information from the page visitor is secure"". Also sounds stupid. "
1645,Should stories be properly estimated before being pulled into an ongoing sprint?,"There are two common reasons why stories or bugs get pulled into a sprint in Scrum (where I work):   Issue was triaged (usually critical/blocker field issues) Sprint was underestimated, and thus items from the backlog get pulled in to keep people busy   In both cases, most items (especially bugs) do not have a story point estimate or time estimate. The first question is: Is it important to have story point estimates on these items before they are brought into an ongoing sprint? And if so, when and how should this estimation take place? We only have sprint planning every 2 weeks (our sprints are two weeks) and I'm assuming it's unproductive to schedule a sprint planning meeting for every bug we bring in.  We use JIRA + JIRA Agile as our tooling to track Scrum sprints. The only functional reason I can think of needing proper estimation for are the reports. Also I worry our velocity will be negatively impacted if we pull in items into the sprint without an estimate. "
1646,"RFI response form asks for ""Assumptions"" as just a single money amount","I am surprised by the last row in this RFI response form:    My project's initial fees are 1m[tex]/year, under the assumption that I provide only the software and they run it on their own hardware. If I had to provide the hardware too that would cost double. In my internal expense calculations, I calculated how much everything actually costs me and then I added +10% to account for risks.   Should I write Add 1m[tex]/year for hardware in the Assumptions field? Or should I fill the three fields with 900k[tex]/year, 100k[tex]/year? Or does it mean something entirely different?   The field is very small, preventing me from writing anything more than a number.  I managed to find the template for this RFI on the Internet, unfortunately it does not seem to provide much more information. "
1647,What skills do I need to beat my competitor to be a good project manager for my team?,"I've learnt project management and I got a project by my lecturer requesting me to form a team. And yes, I have a team now. I just want to be the project manager so badly! My performance has been great so far but I am worried about the competition.   How do I prove to my lecturer that I'm capable of being a good project manager for the team?  Thanks to StackExchange Community, I've learnt so much compared to my competitors.  I just need to be the best. What exactly do I need to prove?   UPDATE:- I don't think I need to improve because my lecturer knows what I'm capable of. I was a team leader twice in my diploma projects. I've experienced the WORST situations and I learnt how to improve myself. The difference is that in my diploma level, I was managing a college project for the sake of an exercise (not a real one). This time, I've been ask to work on a real project.   My point here is that, I want to prove to everyone that I can be the best project manager (Example:- picture a scenario where competitors compete in presidential election campaigns)  I know how to use methodologies depending on the size of project and organizational rules, I know how to manage my team, I know how to solve problems, I know how to plan, organize and manage the project flow. In short, I have the knowledge.  I just want to prove it. Example:- What are the main points you would show to your boss if you want to be chosen as a project manager? "
1648,Can a Business Coordinator become a project manager,"I am working as a Business Coordinator in an IT company. I have completed Bachelors of Technology in Information Technology.  Is there a chance for me to become a Project Manager?  If yes, then what is the way?   "
1649,Should a user journey be a part of a BDD story?,"I am writing a template story document and want to include as many elements as will make for useful, generic stories. Currently, this includes:   Story number Points estimate (fibonacci) State (to do, in dev, done, etc) Priority Blocked flag Author Assignee Title Short description Description Tech notes (bullet point items purely for reference) Acceptance criteria (bullet point items to be ticked off before testing) Scenarios (Given When Then for each unique use case) User journeys (Optional variations as numbered steps which an be applied to the scenarios to provide variations on tests)   My question is: Should I be avoiding User Journeys altogether or do they still have a place in this sort of story?  Also, am I missing anything which might jump out at you as a developer or story author? "
1650,How should we implement items from Sprint Retrospectives?,"Every two weeks we have our Scrum retrospective meeting and everything seems to be great, because we are getting lots of ideas. However, the problem is that these ideas are almost never actually implemented.  I was pushing hard to place all these actionable items--the result of the retrospective meetings--on our Scrum board, but I was told that it is for product-related tasks only. I tried to argue that team development is also a product, but it didn't work.  So, my questions are:   How do you implement items from retrospectives? Do you have any budget (time/money/etc) for such things? How often do you follow up?  "
1651,Burndown Chart Ideal/Projection,"I'm using the redmine agile plugin online demo. The website advertises the plugin with a sample image for ""Work Burndown"" - I am trying to replicate this graph using the demo itself. The sample image from the linked page:    I'm most interested in the portion circled in red. As I understand it the ""Ideal"" grey colored line as you see it here extends out beyond the actual work in order to provide a projection/estimate of when the work might be finished.  As previously stated I am trying to use the online demo itself to replicate this graph and can't seem to figure it out. This is either due to lack understanding of agile/burndown or the tool itself, or both. Here is my graph from the online demo:    Notice that in my graph the ""Ideal"" line doesn't project out past the actual work remaining, it simply ""staircases"" down to meet the end of the graph. It does this no matter the date range I specify.  Any recommendations on how I can make this thing display the estimate projection like in their advertised screen shot? At the time of writing the online demo is available here. "
1652,How to track and manage tooling issues?,"In every complex project, we use a lot of external dependencies and tooling. Of course, they have bugs.  Thanks to Github and the like, it is very easy to fork a project and track issues in libraries dependencies so that's not the scope of this question. The tooling however, can me much more complex to inspect, debug, and submit. Let's restrict here to the Open Source tooling.  If the tool is only used for development and testing purposes, the priority for fixing these annoying bugs is quite low. That's why often, we don't even report the issue as soon as someone found a workaround.  This is bad. We should keep track of the tooling issues as it explain a lot about the life of the project and having them somewhere show everyone that we can fix it, and it will be some value in these fixes. But in the other hand we can't put these issues in the same bucket that the project because they are unrelated and will pollute our issue tracker.  Happiness of my team is one of my top priority, and I cry inside when I see them having to document complex rituals for random situations involving specific conditions met once a week or less.  How do you handle the issues related to your tooling ? How do you prioritize these bugs ?  I realize that my question is quite vague, but I hope it's clear anyway. I will be happy to improve it if you see some flows. "
1653,Managing defects or incidents in a solution based project model,"We have a product suite comprising four products and an underlying data structure.  In the past, we've managed each product's work individually, from backlog to release (as, say, ""XYZ Product July Release"") and incorporated all work into that project under a single project manager.  This is how we delivered minimum viable product.  Now that minimum viable products are delivered, we are bringing solutions to the market that leverage capabilities across multiple products.  For example, we are releasing the ""Retail Market Solution,"" which may involve a change in the XYZ, ABC, and 123 products.  To promote consistency and interoperability, we're managing the solution as a single project that incorporates design and development for the solution as a whole across all products.  Because of this approach, there is a prioritization that happens one level above the individual product backlogs (usually through strategic planning).  So to that Retail Market Solution, we assign one project manager and that person works with the product managers and product owners to identify backlog items that support that solution...and from there, the project is born (and managed either in sprints or in a waterfall fashion, depending on size, project manager, and available staffing/organizational support).  My question is this:  in a model where you're managing product backlogs that capture things outside the solutions list that are small yet still high priority (think defects or incidents...or even very very small enhancements, like a field label change), how do you work those into the project management worklist?  If I have 7 project managers and each one is assigned a project that spans multiple products (ie, a solution), where do the smaller items fit into the cycle?  How do we keep them from falling through the cracks?  Thanks very much! "
1654,"Who can add ""tasks"" in Scrum/Kanban?","I am using Kanban for the process of etablishing a company. It may be kind of wrong since I am both the product owner and the development team. But I think it works, the user stories turns out good. But as a product owner (owner of the company) I need to do different stuff that does not fit user story format. Is the ""task"" concept for new issues only for the development team to create? Or can I as a product owner also add tasks that I as a product owner can do?  How do I do this right? Must I create another project, board, ...? "
1655,What level of detail for BDD scenarios?,"Is it appropriate for BDD scenarios to have ""click here"" style specificity?  I have read a lot of examples where scenarios are stated to avoid any particular user interface interaction, yet tools like SpecFlow would seemingly require this level of detail.  Is it appropriate to require the BA to write a story which contains scenarios at a high level and then work them down to a more technical (and element-specific) level during the 3 amigos phase?  For example, is this appropriate:  Given the user is on /search And the ""Jeff"" is entered into the field ""searchinput"" When the ""Search"" button is clicked Then the page displayed is /results/Jeff And the fields displayed include ""Name"" And the second field displayed is ""Post Code""   The story example and tooling example on this page appear to be incompatible if we are trying to get from one to the other (ignoring the fact that they are in very different business processes): [website]"
1656,Accepting the sprint in the Review meeting? And some other Review questions,"My company has implemented a new process of having the team be responsible for the Definition of Done inside of the sprint.  In the Sprint Review meeting the PO is shown the work for the first time and they go through each issue in front of the team and then make comments on the issue e.g. ""does it work as intended. if not, how? Defect created...""  Reading lots about Scrum this doesn't seem to be the ""Scrum"" was to do things, in fact a lot of resources explicitly say that having the review meeting as an acceptance meeting is a bad thing and it should be about feedback.  The problem with this is when should the PO be seeing the work? When do we accept/reject a sprint?  We currently don't have the PO testing in a sprint because of a few reasons:   If a PO is testing during a sprint then the ownership of making sure issues are understood isn't on the team, they could half understand and just implement something and then get an explanation from the PO after they've showed it to them. There's also less need for a team to test their own work because they've got the PO there to catch things. The PO has a lot of things to do during the sprint e.g. Backlog grooming, meeting clients, if we add in testing during the sprint to this then there may be too much to do.   Again these are all assumptions we have made so any thoughts on these would be extremely helpful. "
1657,How frequently can a release happen within a Scrum Sprint?,"I am aware that the length of a Scrum Sprint can vary on a case to case basis. This raises the following questions:   How can product releases be handled within the Sprint time-box? How frequently can the release happen? Does Scrum have any rules that require releases only at the end of a Sprint? How does it affect the product, developers, and testers?  "
1658,How to convince others to change project management process,"I'm a statistical modeler at a large bank in a highly regulated area.  I work in a team of about twelve people divvied up between three managers.   Right all of our statistical models are developed using a simple waterfall style methodology which where the models go from ""Data Collection"" to ""Methodology""  and then to ""Specification and Testing"" among other milestones.    The current management keeps setting target dates that are far too aggressive for model development in this framework, as a result most of the modelers are working long hours, weekends, etc...  I'm taking a break from writing up documentation on a Sunday morning to type this.  The current set up for development came into being seven months ago and since then our turnover rate has skyrocketed. In a 12ish person team we've had five people quit or transfer out of the department in seven months.  As a result I'm the only non-manager in the group who was with the bank prior to the re-organization.  I'm also contemplating leaving the department.   I strongly suspect that the issue is that the current head of the team and his managers have no idea how to set deliverable dates for this kind of work.  All of managers come from an analytics background and seem to have no experience with model development.  I wrote a memo several months ago encouraging the team to explore an agile development style but this was largely ignored, we are not co-located which makes adoption of pure agile methods difficult in any case.   How do I tell the managers to get it together on the project management front and either set sensible milestones for our waterfall tracking (using something like critical chain?) or move to Agile?     P.S. for this kind of development work it's extremely difficult to forecast how long development will take until you've done at least a couple weeks of preliminary work (getting data/cleaning data/etc...) .  "
1659,How to handle arising tasks we want to address later in Scrum,"Considering we're talking about Scrum,   When working on a backlog item and that new out-of-scope minor tasks arise what do you do with them? (e.g.: ones we don't have time for right now such as minor refactoring or implementing tiny nice to haves)  Do I create orphan tasks to be later assigned to a backlog item with similar other tasks during the sprint planning meeting? Should I create a backlog item (requirement, or user story) with pretty much the same title as the task and assign the task to it?  E.g.: Let's say I create a new task which is ""add a simple caption to a control"". Should I promote it to a backlog items and in this case, what would be the task for that backlog item?  Thanks everyone! "
1660,How to manage story points when several developers work on 1 story?,"My team consists of 2 backend devs, 1 front end dev and designer. Lets pretend we have next user story:     As a user I want to sign-in/sign-out to use the system    Designer says that it is equal to 2 story points. Back end devs believe, that this is a 1 point story, while front end dev thinks, that it equals to 3 points (due to animations,transitions etc.) What amount of story points should be the outcome of this user story?  Should I sum up the overall number of points for 1 user story?   Should I split the user story to  3 different stories? (backend, frontend, design)  Should I just lean to the maximum story point value? "
1661,Is implement business analysis in an organisation the best way?,"The organization I'm currently working at, have no business analysis approach.  Due to that lack, all the changes/upgrades we are doing or trying to do are hellish. The technical person has trouble trying to understand our requirements, we yell at the technical person telling him almost literally that he is ""not smart"" enough to understand what we are trying to do.  As the issue happen, again and again, I would like to improve this process.  As we are a small structure, we don't need yet big functional requirements yet.   I would like to start simple functional requirements that can be easily understood by a technical person.  Questions are the following:   What kind of business analysis methodology, should I look at? How can I use that methodology to structure the functional approach and get it done to something more technical? As the structure I'm working at is not big, I'm unsure if it is the right approach. However, if it is not, what approach should I try?   Thanks "
1662,"Gantter/ProjectLibre multiple resources to one task, start ASAP, divide work unequally","I am using Gantter and/or ProjectLibre (which are both almost identical to Microsoft Project in functionality). I think that if there is a solution to this in Microsoft Project, then it will work in either of these too.  Here is the scenario: Task 1: Work 5d (40h): Resource A Task 2: Work 2d (16h): Resource B Task 3: Work 20d (160h): Predecessor Task 2: Resources A and B  I would like Resource B to start Task 3 at the end of 2 days and Resource A to start Task 3 at the end of 5 days.  Note that ""Work"" above is the effort estimated by us for the task.  Ideally, Task 3 should start on day 3 with Resource B who should spend 11.5 days on it and Resource A should spend 8.5 days once Task 1 is done.  However, when I allocate 2 resources to the task with 100% units, it gets divided equally into 10 days each. The Task 3 starts on day 3 and I get over-allocated resources message because Resource A spends 3 days on both Task 1 and Task 3.  I know I can do this allocation manually by detailing the resource assignment. The question is can this be automated in some way? It's bizarre that this has to be done manually. I assume that it must be a pretty common requirement? Or am I mistaken? "
1663,Interface building and background programming in a project,"Let's say, we have a project with:    a well defined user interface the application's features specified in details backoffice, where the data comes from.   The backoffice development takes less then the interface creation. The programmers don't know about the data structure what they will receive from the BO. The features specified depends in 80% on the BO.  What is the best solution?   Give the developers the interface to begin the creation, knowing that they won't finish until the BO development and data structuring will come. It's possible in this case to: work less then the expectations (UI highly depends on the data structure from the BO) Give the developers the interface creation and the whole project only when the BO development and structuring finished. In this case - if the project is urgent - it's possible to have delays on some tasks, or even the whole project.  Solution somewhere the first to: to give the developers the UI, but the condition to do only what they can finish until the BO development, and when the BO comes, the app development can start with 100% power.   Did you ever met with this kind of problem? How did you solve it and with success or fail? "
1664,Physical board/overview for multiple projects with many participants,"We're a webdesign agency with numerous simultaneous projects, and a lot of people working on different projects. We already have an online PM-system which works fairly well, but we'd like a physical board to represent the current status.  Is there any specific technique/structure I should use in this case? Below is a description of what data we'd like to have projected.  Note that our online PM-system has all the details, which people can look up there - so the project board doesn't need to encode everything  Need to have info:   Current projects Upcomming projects People Who is project manager for a given project? Who is currently working on a given project? Must be easy to see which projects a given person is currently working on   Nice to have info:   When is a project due?

1665,What are the general guidelines a project manager should follow to recruit the right person?,"Since our HR manager is out of station, I have been given the responsibility to recruit people for our hardware design team. I do not have any experience of recruiting people. Posting a job on linkedin, resulted in spamming with 25 CVs in a day.   What are the general guidelines I should follow to recruit right person?   What approach I should adopt so that I recruit best person in least time, and making sure that I do not ignore the best one? "
1666,"Would Scrum & Kanban work for a small organisation with several ""projects""","Background  My question deals with introducing Scrum and/or Kanban in a small organisation (currently 9 employees), but with several more or less distinguished areas of focus, some including only one person. Mainly my concern is with how to keep everyone in the organisation involved in where we are heading as an organisation, but finding a better method than less-than-productive weekly meetings, like we have now.  We are a community TV channel, with our main sources of income being either paid video/TV productions or projects with grants for a limited time (usually 1-3 years), plus some ""general income"" such as membership fees and sponsoring. The projects are in that sense partly separate (as they have their own aim, purpose &amp; budget, stated in the project application), but still an integral part of the organisation.  Current organisation  Our current organisation looks like this (some staff are involved in several projects/teams):   1. Executive Director (100%) 2. Director of Operations (100%)  9. Marketing (25%, not technically a paid staff role, but at the moment rather an extra responsibility of one of the project leaders below) 3. Financial administrator (20%, accounting, human resources) 4. Programming manager, incl. IT &amp; administration (100%) Production Team (also includes others when there is demand)  5. Producer (50-60%) 6. Technical manager (50%)  Projects  Project 1  7. Project leader (100%, but up to 25% also with general productions) 8. Developer (50%, server management, programming, web - including about 10-15% with development of the organisation's website) 5. Producer (40-50%) 3. Financial administrator (15%)  Project 2   9. Project leader (75%) 5. Producer (about 10%) 3. Financial administrator (15%)      To complicate further, The Director of Operations, Technical Manager &amp; the Project Leader for Project 1 are all available for productions when demand arises. Even the Executive Director at times. And the developer, employed at 50%, is using 25% of his time for the general website.  100% means 40 hours per week. Thus, the Project Leader for Project 1 is working 30-40 hours per week with Project 1, since he's also available for productions that require more people, etc.  Going forward  My idea is that the Director of Operations (me) will also be the Scrum Master both for the Production Team &amp; Project 1. Project 2 is on its last year and consists mainly of the project leader. For Project 1 Scrum would fit well, particularly for the developer parts, but Kanban would be more fitting for the Production Team, as well as the production parts of Project 1.  But how then to keep the financial administrator &amp; the programming manager in the loop? The financial administrator will not really benefit from participating in daily scrums &amp; the programming manager is kind of independent, although partly connected to the Production Team. And the producer is divided between the Production Team &amp; the two projects.  One reason I've been looking into agile project management is to assist the project leader in Project 1, as his experience in planning &amp; leading projects is very limited.  Conclusion  Sorry for a long post. But do you think some combination of Scrum and Kanban would work for an organisation like this? Some of us have started to use Trello for this.  And how to keep everyone in the organisation in the loop with what's happening in the other teams and for the organisation as a whole? We have started using Slack for team communication, but since we're all physically in the same facility, some sort of physical meetings with the entire staff would also be good. "
1667,How far should you vertically slice?,"We are a small team of 4 software developers trying to use Scrum. We have a large project to start from scratch and we've hit a roadblock regarding slicing the project.  The project is a distributed system with many different components:   SQL Server database A couple of web services implementing OAuth 2.0 (which we're rolling ourselves) An audit web service A FHIR web service (eventually) Server-side modules (.NET assemblies) A JavaScript based Single Page Application (SPA) JavaScript based modules housed within the SPA Our own in-house JavaScript framework for building the SPA modules   Our first PBI seems so simple: A user can log-in using their smartcard.  The problem now is using this user story to vertically slice, as just about all agile advice out there recommends: do we slice across the entire system?  If we do, it seems we're biting off a monumental amount; we would need to implement all of the OAuth behaviour including permission verification, most of the JS framework (HTTP handling, template and data-binding), the basics of the SPA and all the database structure and SQL logic that's required just to support this.  If we are to see each PBI as a deliverable unit that provides value to the user, there doesn't seem to be a way to break this down.  I've read so much on this yet all examples refer to much smaller and simpler applications.  Are we just being too rigid with our interpretation of Scrum? "
1668,What's an easy and sustainable way to introduce pair programming?,"As a ScrumMaster I've read some texts about pair programming. I want to introduce that to my team and make sure it's been done regularly. As a ""special feature"" we have a remote worker and I want him to be part of this movement. My goals are, as literature mentions, to improve code quality, transfer of knowledge and become ""faster"" at some point.  My questions are:   How to roll out pairing in a Scrum team? What are best practices for starting and executing pairing? How can I make sure pairing lasts and is no flash in the pan?  How can I help the team to include the remote worker?   The question is slightly related to this one: How can my team reconcile flow and pair-programming? but I am more focused on the Scrum Master view.  As I got three good answers, but I only can accept one, here's a short summary:   All answers suggest, that the idea of pairing should come from the team itself (maybe the Scrum Master could steer towrds this direction) Pairing can be done using the driver / navigator metaphor It is not said, that paring might be necessary the whole time. Don't be dogmatic as @Muhammad mentioned This can be done via screen sharing and video chat. Timezones might be a problem.  "
1669,Priority vs Business Value,"We use a sort of cruddy old SLDC module in Service Now for keeping track of sprints.  It has a field for Story Points and Priority.  Priority is 1 - Critical through 5 - Moderate.  Does this track with Business Value in the Scrum World?    At my previous job, where I was scrummaster and we used paper to track stories (at least during the sprint), I asked the Product Owner to place a number (in the same scale as story points, but I don't think that's essential) on each of the stories he brought with him to sprint planning.  Then we did our ROI calculations to prioritize our work.   Now, I don't see this ""Priority"" in Service Now being anything but a holdover from people who don't understand or care about Scrum.    What is the difference between priority and business value and how can I effectively communicate that we, as a scrum team, need a Product Owner who puts business value on stories?  "
1670,How do you manage technical debt?,"In real world, business initiatives always take higher priority as there are associated ROIs and deliver something tangible to the users. But there are technical initiatives and projects that need to be done to keep up with the different versions of software, upgrading to a newer platforms, architecture re-factoring etc.,    How can we plan, prioritize and manage such competing initiatives? Is there a model to quantify technical debt and its impact to the business?  "
1671,How to deal with a missed deadline and obtain a new target date?,"I apologize if this sounds basic, but here's the scenario: We were supposed to complete a project in August and now that it's November, it's still in progress. After asking the client to provide us with feedback regarding certain tasks, the response was along the lines of, ""don't push me. You missed the deadline, so now I decide when this project is completed"".   I have to admit that I was thrown off, but this brings up another question: as a web dev shop, we take on multiple projects at a time and a delay like this affects our ability to take on new projects. So how does one decide when a project gets completed? I'm thinking that I'll have to sit down with the client because, obviously, he doesn't want the project up and running in 20 years from now. He must have some vague expectation of project completion that's in the near future. So the question is how would I approach this? I'm relying on other project managers with far more experience than me who may have come across this scenario. "
1672,"How do you write completable ""stories"" when all members of a team have a specialty?","From a user perspective our stories seem clear. From a engineering perspective our stories are a bit too broad and need to be broken up into sub-tasks. This is OK, but each member of the team has a specialty. They can only really deliver estimates for each specialty (eg data vs backend vs front-end). We also have a different capacity for each specialty on each team and the story points may not mean the same thing to each specialty area.   In addition, it seems that user stories, in general, don't get completed till the end of the milestone given that everyone is working on different things and it doesn't come together until the end.  So my questions are:   How do you define user stories that are completable by the end of sprint? How does pointing work in team where everyone has a specialty? How can you in turn use this pointing with velocity in this case? Each specialty has a different capacity after all.  "
1673,'Promoted' to Release Manager - Now What?,"Background:  I work for a small, 7-person Analytics/Consulting company. Originally, I was taken on to be a data analyst, but the needs of the company changed, and the principle requested I take up the role of Release Manager and QA tester. Note that my degree is in economics, not software.   My Problem  The biggest difficulty I've had stepping into this role is managing our projects. We currently do not use a bug tracker, we do not use a project management tool, and we are struggling to find an efficient way to produce release notes and communicate todos.   We have over 150 git repositories and at any given time, 50 are being developed on. On average, each project has 3 dependencies, each with a specific development or release version. I find this to be a bit overwhelming, and our current way of communicating is to talk or print notes.   This doesn't seem efficient or scalable. A further problem is that the principle is vehemently against using a bug tracker since we're small. I find that troublesome because it means we have no audit trail, and it makes keeping track of progress difficult for me.   Going Forward  Going forward, there are two big questions I'm trying to grapple with:     How should I actually go about 'managing' our projects? What technologies and concepts should I be familiarizing myself with to succeed in this role? Currently, I am somewhat familiar with the following tools:   Ant Artifactory Git Grunt Jenkins Maven   "
1674,How to encourage coworkers to engage in knowlege-transfer?,"We are a small company, with projects requiring 1 to ~5 coworkers at a time, that are nearly never in our own offices. In short, we are highly distributed and have very rare chances to spread knowledge internally.  Now we want to change that and achieve some progress in knowledge management, firstly by using our centralised wiki, using internal articles, reports and themed topics related to the fundamentals of our work, that should be written and reviewed by our coworkers.  The wiki has been there for a long time already. It does not look very nice and usabilty could be far better, but it is usable. As it was an expensive piece of software there is currently no chance to replace it with another.  The point of this question is, how can we motivate our coworkers to contribute to the wiki? What kind of incentives (other than money) can be practical?  "
1675,Project Manager - Writing Project Specification,"Background  I've been in web development field for past 8 years , and i got myself a management role as a Project Manager several months back. Most of the time i'm dealing with open source web technology ( LAMP )  My Problem  Recently i got myself a job offer which is a good paid job. The things that trouble me is , the new employer require me to write project specification in .NET which i do not know how at the moment. In my previous company , system analysis are the one that write all the specification.  Thoughts  Since i'm not very good in .NET i will for sure pick up the language in near future so that i can communicate well with the project team. But then at the moment , it's a good idea to arrange a meeting with the project team especially the team leader to go through the project specification that my upper management require me to write?   Should i only arrange a meeting with Team Leader to go through specification? OR the whole team? "
1676,Are employee's pay factored into costs for project?,"Here's my story.  I started working for a new company as an interface developer, with a small team of 3, for a semi-large laboratory 2 weeks ago.  When I came into the department all of their projects were being managed by either paper or excel spreadsheets.  Seeing an opportunity to tidy up the project management and do some coordination in assets and resources I spoke with my director and they've offered to pay for training within Microsoft Project and Project Server to have this all setup while I manage the projects as well as do development work. I'm a developer at heart, but have always wanted to learn PM.   Being brand new to this, I want to be able to track around 40 projects a year as well as give cost analysis and reports at the end of the year to my director on the work we've done.  These are strictly ROI projects as we do not make any money for doing the work, rather it's a service we provide to our clients.  The individual cost of the project will be dependent on the amount of work needed, and the amount that will need to be paid out to vendors to have the software interfacing done on their end.    My question is, should employee pay be factored in to the cost of the project?  They are obviously resources but knowing another employees pay rate is something that's discouraged when working for a company.  If this is so, how is the best way to approach this method?  IS it worth factoring this in for such a small amount of projects?  Any help on this would be greatly appreciated.  Thanks! "
1677,"Accounting for design, discovery and analysis activities in Scrum project budget forecasts","Consider this scenario:  Backlog: 100 story points, project budget [tex]1000 time spent).

Week 1: Budget spent $10,000, 0 SP delivered Intensive UX design activities, refining the backlog, development setup  Week 2: Budget spent $10,000, 10 SP delivered Development starts, refining the backlog   Week 3: Budget spent $7,500, 10 SP delivered Development continues, refining the backlog   Week 4: Budget spent $12,500, 10 SP delivered Development continues, refining the backlog, intensive stakeholder workshop activities around later epics (approx. $5,000)  Cost to date is $40,000, we've delivered 30 story points. How do you forecast the cost to deliver the remaining 70 story points?  Applying a straight calculation: current project costs [tex]1,333 = [tex]133,333 total cost. But this doesn't account for the fact the UX design and workshops required early in the project have completed and the development team is delivering faster than anticipated.  Is there a common, recognised method to forecast remaining cost for Scrum development projects that accounts for surrounding design and analysis activities? "
1678,How Test Driven Development can pretend to be Agile?,"How Test Driven Development can pretend to be Agile? To do Test Driven Development you need to write your test first. Then you need to know your methods, your business and your scenario before coding. Actually you need a full business and technical analyze of your software. You are definitively not agile.  And what about refactoring? How wan I refactor my tests or unit tests before my code. Each time I want to refactor or change something in my code I need to adapt first my tests. It's not really Agile. It's too heavy to be Agile. Eventually you can say than with testing you are Agile but you are even more Agile without testing.  "

1681,Advice for a Non-Technical Newbie Scrum Master,"I have recently joined a fantastic company which prides itself on its Agile philosophy and work ethic. I am a VERY junior Project Manager, and the more I learn about Scrum and Agile, the more I want to specialise in this space. However, I see two potential problems:   I am not technical (Ie: I cannot code) and am concerned this will interfere with my efficiency when liaising with team members I am a junior and so acting as a team mentor/servant leader sounds fantastic in theory, but I know how I would perceive such a person were roles reversed, and so I really don't want to tread on anyone's toes   I have trained as a counselor and psychologist, and so my real passion is people and bringing people together. What I love about the Scrum master role is that it is that of an enabler, empowering people in the work place. The company took me on as they saw potential and wanted to train me in this arena. However, I am concerned that without a technical background coupled with being so junior, I might not be effective in this particular role.  Is it feasible or even possible to enter the IT industry in a Scrum Master role? If so, does anyone have any recommendations, or lessons learnt from being in a similar position once upon a time? Any practical tips would be greatly appreciated. "
1682,Kanban : why should we monitor each person in the team?,"I have been lately confronted to an argument with my top level hierarchy in the deployment of a Kanban process.   As my arguments was to do columns like "" Todo, In prog, done, so on ... ""  I have also added lines for tasks assignement per person was a good way to track the activity and identify issues throught the project's timeline.  Like a corridor for each people in the team in the Kanban board.  But my project manager says that it was more like a "" bad tracking"" in order to stigmatize people and point the finger to them if tasks doesn't move. If you don't explicitly assign a task to someone, you see it as a big picture and the whole team should move together to assure continuous delivery.   As I'm whole new in this, can you tell me, please, what is the point of explicitly assign a task to someone in a Kanban board ? And what are the advantages and the cons to not do so ?   Thanks you.

1683,Tool for Managing the Feature Development Process,"Background: we currently use MantisBT for tracking of bug tickets, and have attempted to use the same for feature development. The latter has worked, but only to a point. Ours is a small shop, so large Agile methodologies seem a bit much, and none of us are really well-versed. The software/cloud products I keep finding all share that theme: very large. We are in the process of setting up a physical Kanban board for the procedural stuff, but I need a way to track the actual feature maturation process.  Question: what tools are available for specifically tracking feature development?  As a basic example: I would like to create a ""feature"" and then add to it supporting details such as a description, files (pictures, files from Balsamiq, Word docs, etc.), priority, users, resources, and time frame (start/end dates). More, of course, but I hope you get the idea.  You would be correct in thinking that this seems a lot like generic project management.  And if there is a tool that fits the bill, I want to consider it.  The more closely it suits software feature development, however, the better.  I have found a weath of tools that might fit the bill, but the specific parts for tracking features always seem to be part of a much larger system.  Are there any that focus specifically on the feature lifecycle, without trying to encompass every aspect of the agile process? "

1686,Stories added after commitment,"I'm trying to understand the following problem: within a SAFe framework a development team adds user stories after commitment, even though that commitment has not been met. The justification is that if these new user stories are not completed, the larger epics/features will be endangered.   As a side note, this team spends an excessive amount of time planning during Iteration Planning.   My question is: Should these new user stories be counted as tasks?   My confusion is around the principle of ""just enough to start"" during iteration planning. As in each story should have just enough information for team members to start working on them. If during the course of the collaboration, new dependencies or work is uncovered, does that constitute a new user story?   My thought is that these should be listed as tasks, and if there is ambiguity that should be factored in the estimating.   Any thoughts, insights, or feedback are welcome. "
1687,Difference between scrum and kanban,"I have worked on scrum projects and kanban projects and until now I thought I knew the difference (!?)

Should kanban stories be assigned points or just lead estimates? What does kanban say about INVEST? Specifically, vertical slices of functionality? Does the kanban backlog have a priority order (how are the stories sequenced?)  "

1689,Having problems within development team re approach,"Noob PM here - I have a project with 3 developers (one of whom is tech lead), a BA, and a tester. The tech lead (hereafter referred to as TL) is responsible (on the RACI) for the technical output of the team, i.e actually delivering the software.  TL would like to deliver the project using a kanban-like methodology, and has asked the BA to deliver high level epics which they have then together broken into stories. This was all pre-project. Now the project has kicked off, TL has organised planning meetings which everyone is attending, with the view of breaking down the stories into tasks and estimating.   However, at first planning meeting another of the developers who had worked closely with the business area in question to produce a very basic proof of concept as part of our requirements gathering, rejected the approach out of hand, saying that there was no point in going back to basic user stories when we already understood most of the process and what needed to be delivered, and refused to take part in the task break-down and estimation activities.   TL has recently come to me and stated that they can no longer be responsible for the output of said team member. I'm at the point where I don't care what methodology they use but we need to get started and I am unsure how to intervene (or if I even should) to best continue.   Is there another methodology I can suggest which will mollify the team member who doesn't want to estimate tasks, and also give us the ability to be agile and transparent in our delivery? Would it be feasible to allow said developer to continue along their line of development in parallel to the rest of the team and somehow allow the two resulting solution-strands to merge at some point? What would any of you do in my place?   Thanks for your advice. "

1692,What are the disadvantages of the Scrum Master being the hierarchical superior in the company?,"In a small- to mid-size company trying to implement scrum, it may very well happen that the hierarchical superior of the Team members becomes the Scrum Master (short of being able to fund a full-time Scrum Master position). For example, it could be the CTO in a software start-up company with, say, seven employed developers.  By implementing scrum, the CTO would of course agree to ""lose"" the authority on the team organisation, task allocation, etc. as it should be. Rather, my question is whether or not the ""natural"" authority that the Scrum Master has over the Team members (e.g. due to him being CTO) would be an impediment for the process. What are the issues with such a situation? Is it common? Are there any measures that can be used to alleviate the disadvantages? "

1694,questions allowed in scrum team,"Situation: - there is a specific team member who is not giving all his\her contribution - it has been communicated multiple times on the team level that we need to take initiative because we are responsible for picking up and finishing tasks. More we do, more respect (and therefore salaries eventually) is earned.  Given the fact that giving suggestion on team level is not working, neither is 1 on 1 discussions, in a scrum team, what kind of questions are allowed and who can ask them directly to the person in question? For example:   What is taking so long to complete this kind of task every time? what you are not taking initiative? ...   EDIT:  To answer @yitznewton comment. This person unfortunately is from other department (QA) and we have strict policy not to interfere with other departments even though we have agile and work in scrum team. I can see that    The task that would take about two hours almost every time goes to next day Even though I have suggested to the team that if you have other tasks we do should do them as per priority. I can see that still lower priority tasks are worked on first (I have started getting answers such as ""I worked on other things so I didn't work on task I was supposed to."" without any explanation about what ""other things"" are. but due to policy mentioned above, I cannot interfere much.) Even if there are enough tasks (so that we don't have to pull anything from next backlog), many times tasks spill over but since I cannot ask pointed questions, all I do is advise team in general what we should do as per agile process. When the task is finished, and there is free time, instead of pulling other tasks into the sprint (for example we usually have lot of studies to do), time is spent on anything but work. Every time, I need to assign work which I have explained multiple times that they can do that by themselves.  Every time I miss to do that, it is taken as a chance not to work. While my mistakes are pointed out (and there are few) quite visibly, my help is not acknowledged at all.  I can see that (even though I don't want to) inordinate amount of time is being spent on chatting to spouse, facebook, blogs, instagram.   When this person does work, it's a quality work, that's the only reason why I have been bearing this for long time.   Thanks in advance! "
1695,What do Scrum Masters do all day?,"So this is a question that many people have answered on their blogs and I think one person even wrote a mini book a answering this question. However, I wasn't able to relate to them so I am hoping to get some input from experienced Scrum Masters / Coaches over here.  Let me elaborate with some scenarios:   You are a SM, you saw the daily scrum take place smoothly, the team is gone back to their desks to work.  You are a SM, you have worked with the PO and the team and the Product Backlog is appropriately groomed for the upcoming Sprint, due in say 2 weeks. The organization is doing quite well in their agile journey and doesn't necessarily need any urgent coaching All the artefacts are up to date thanks to an online tool that automates quite a bit   Also, you can assume the team is in the ""Performing"" stage of team development and you are a full time employee for this one team.  So how do you fill the rest of your day/s?  I am not look for answers listing responsibilities of a SM, like removing impediments or coaching. Neither do I want a daily schedule with entries like ""meet with John to discuss XYZ"". That doesn't take much time.  Instead, I am hoping to get some real-life examples that can be replicated. Something that is actually common for all SM of software teams.  For example, in my own case, I have mostly worked on mega projects so the backlog grooming took forever in the early stages of the project and as things progressed, I would help out with end user support, training, pick up some independent technical tasks and get them done, or just do documentation. These would take from a day to a whole sprint, especially if I pick up a couple of stories.   What about you guys? I am particularly keen to get some feedback from purists who say 1 SM, and only 1 SM, per 1 or 2 teams at most. "
1696,Algorithm to schedule tasks according to resource availability,"Is there an algorithm to schedule tasks according to the resource availability? i.e. Andrew can only work on Tasks A, B, C; Betty only Tasks D, E and Cathy only Tasks F, G, H, I. All tasks A to I have different duration and dependency relationships with each other. The objective of the algorithm is to minimize the total project duration given these constraints.  I have tried to search for resource-based scheduling and all of them are basically resource-leveling classroom examples i.e. the objective is to keep the number of resources consistent throughout the project, assuming all resources are homogeneous/equal/inter-changeable, which is definitely not the case in reality.  If there is such an algorithm, can you please point me to the correct search terms or names of existing applications that can already do this? "

1698,Scaled scrum/agile frameworks (SAFe vs. Nexus vs. LeSS) comparison,"Would someone please shed some light on the differences between:   LeSS: [website]Nexus: [website]SAFe: [website]Background: I do work in a company with about 50 developers, and multiple scrum teams. They do, however, work in different projects that are unrelated - thus no need to ""scale"" them as far as I understand (I might be wrong, thus asking this question). This question is an attempt to obtain a general comparison for a beginner between the main ""scaled scrum/agile"" frameworks/methods/standards listed above.  Questions to drive the analysis are:   Why use one rather than the other? Does one covers more areas than the other? What is the ""most popular"" framework as of today? What are their strengths or weaknesses? Moreover, certification-wise, is any of these more ""recognised"" than the other?  "
1699,using the prototype for live when building CMS/CRUD systems - wrong?,"I'm currently reading Steve McConnells ""Survival Guide"" and am thinking of how I can  improve our processes on requirements development. The book seems to have very strong ideas about using prototypes and I'm not sure if they are quite right for us.  As background, we are 2 fulltime staff and we usually work on projects of 4-6 man months size, while we are also doing often significant amounts of maintenance on existing clients sites. About 80% of projects have about 1/2 man month of web design involved, which is usually done by an external contractor.   We develop in-house software for owner operators, largely based on CRUD generated admin interfaces using Symfony, which we often combine with a Joomla CMS website system (WYSIWYG and configuration type entry screens)  My thoughts on requirements development are:   If I was to build a prototype it would be fastest to actually just generate the CRUD interface in Symfony, unless it is a complex interface, then a paper storyboard would be faster. I would however see no reason not to re-use the data model for the final CRUD generation - McConnells advised strongly against this. The reason why this is fastest is that we don't have good mockup and design skills in-house and it seems likely quicker to write a quick, rough data model and produce the output by copying in past clients HTML and buttons. For some users it may be sufficient to showcase another project, then to just tell them what field we are going to have  in which screen Many CMS problems could also be modelled by example of case studies, then describing fields. Writing a user manual seems to be the most productive way to gather requirements as it can be used at the end   The question is: are CRUD tools a good way to build prototypes or am I tricking myself? Is anyone else here using CRUD tools for prototyping? Or alternatively, how long should it take me to learn mocking up prototypes by copying existing screens/ rows/ fields/ buttons around with Gimp/ Photoshop? "
1700,"Awarding responsibilities in a small, but multi-leveled company","Today, we stumbled upon an abstract problem due to the lack of experience. Five of us are starting a company, everything is carefully planned and organised, but... When we tried to split responsibilities between us for the activities and projects we so far have - we did not know in what effective and logic way to do so.  Thing is.. We as a company X have a few subset operations. A, B and C for example. A is dealing with web development and social media. B is our own project that we are developing. C is tourism counseling.  A then later on splits on different clients a1, a2, a3, projects and so on. So can C too in near future.  It is important to award one person to be responsible for a certain project, activity, etc.. But in this multi-leveled structure we just don't see the way how to do so, when does the responsibility of one level end, and when another one starts. Is a person responsible for A also responsible for a1 or does the responsibility end before branching into a1 and another person takes in?  Further on, how to keep track of it all? We are using Trello for simple task management, it would be amazing to somehow implement responsibility overview chart too.  Thank you for the time. "

As I just said, we already have a custom software solution which is being used in almost the whole company. We also have 3 developers working on this. We are only interested in the financial/accounting part of an ERP system, so I am not talking about a complete ERP.  The other option is to buy an ERP system and come up with some kind of interface between our sales software and the ERP system. According to SAP this is possible.  I came up with some pros and cons:  Custom Solution:   100% fits business needs Cheap customization 1 solution for the entire company Flexibility in future changes Low initial investment We can make it so that the people using it don't have to change the way they are used to work.

1703,Costs for estimating the tasks in a project?,"Before the Planning (and initial) phase of a project, there is obviously going to be some time devoted to an analysis of the client's requirements. I know this might be hard to answer, but is this time typically billable?  Example: I'm dealing with a complex software project - a client has an Excel spreadsheet with a million rows and around 25 columns. The data populated in the cells is based on complex calculations between each of the columns (or fields).   The developer and PM (me) go into a conference call and spend an hour estimating the scope of work. I decide that the developer and myself (as I have a technical background) will require another 10-15 hours of work to figure out the mechanics of the Excel file, which will include providing documentation that contains the suggest approach for building the app (framework to  be used, hosting environment, etc.)  The client feels that this ""digging into the analysis"" (the 10-15 hours) should not be billable as no real development work is being done (i.e. converting the Excel file into a web based app).  From your experience, how much time do you give away for ""free"" for estimating the actual work of a project? "

The task duration is automatically set to 2 days. Since I figure out Bob won't have full time to spend on this task, I double click on the task to add Alice to the resources. I assign Alice to work 50% time on the task and change Bob from 100% to 50%. When applying the change, duration automatically changes to 2,67 days. Why? Two persons are working on a 16 h fixed work task, each with 50%. Why is there 0,67 days more scheduled than needed?  In case in the same task now I delete all resources and click OK and then insert resources again, now for Bob and Alice I assign 50% availability at the beginning, the calculation is correct. 2 days needed for the task to complete. No other changes were made - just resources deleted and entered again.  When the problem is present and I check the Team planner, I can see that Bob and Alice do not work the whole task duration.

1716,Retrospective: difference between gathering data and generating insights?,"I am reading a book called Agile Retrospectives and the author suggests splitting retro's into 4 stages. Two of the stages seem so similar:  Gathering Data and Gathering insights, seem the same as I cannot imagine some of these exercises would work if you did both a gathering data and generating insight exercise.  Some of the generating insight exercises require you too...gather data! Very confusing. Are people using both of these stages in retros?  Does that make sense? Any thoughts?  Update: My confusion stems from my inability to link to a gathering data exercise with a gathering insight phase. That is my problem.   For example: I make the team brainstorm what went well, what did not go well in the data gathering stage, then do I simply set that aside and move onto a data insight exercise which also, in it self, requires the team to write a bunch of ideas down.  "
1717,How much code documentation should an effective Scrum Team produce?,"As part of the audit and compliance for my company (PLC), any Agile Projects are treated as a normal Waterfall Projects for review purposes although run according to Scrum best practice.  We don't interfere in the process, we simply treat them equally for compliance.  How much software documentation is reasonable for an Agile Team to produce whilst working to fortnightly Sprints?  The new Scrum Master balked at any documentation and we seem to have settled upon documenting any aspect which has the risk of impacting another departments dependency.  (In short - if they break something that is not theirs, they have some documentation to back up the process, intent and reasoning).  How much documentation would you expect a Scrum Team to produce working within a Multinational Corporation?  Current tools in use for administration are Confluence/JIRA.  The primary rebuttal against in-depth documentation was that    It needs factored in as a User Story and given a points value (which I accept) It ruins the flow of the developers work (also accepted) Documentation is out of date within a week because of code changes/improvements etc (which I do not wholly accept) Documentation is contained within the code (Which I have rejected outright as worst practice)   My concerns are   In 3,5 or 10 years time a new developer might require documentation Having read Code Complete and been a Front-End Dev I was taught to document Agile purists use the ""working software"" principle as a shield for no docs  Compliance with external auditors, internal governance and shareholder value   I hope I have provided sufficient detail for someone to answer or guide me in my learning.  Have any writers touched on this aspect?  My hopes are that   A piece of software can extract code comments and package them as a report  The Scrum Master is just being protective but a consensus can be reached  "
1718,What is kanban?,I'm curious as to what kanban is. I just learned about it seconds ago reviewing another question.   (a) What is involved that would consider it Kanban?  (b) Also how does it different from other processes?   I looked through a lot of threads and the only one related to this topic on PM.SE would be the one asking: Is there a list of good kanban books? 
1719,Who should decide about changes in the process - Scrum Master or the whole Scrum Team?,"I need some clarification about how the changes should be introduced within the process in a Scrum Team and how a Scrum Master should approach it.  By changes in the process I mean for example: changing the length of a sprint, introducing some practices such as limitting Work In Progress, pair-programming etc.  My considerations:  Scrum Master manages the process. Mike Cohn's webpage states:     ScrumMaster has no authority over Scrum team members, the ScrumMaster   does have authority over the process.” (...) ScrumMaster can say,   “I’ve decided we’re going to try two-week sprints for the next month.”   He also compares Scrum Master to a personal trainer:     The trainer cannot make you do an exercise you don’t want to do.   Instead, the trainer reminds you of your goals and how you’ve chosen   to meet them. To the extent that the trainer does have authority, it   has been granted by the client. ScrumMasters are much the same: They   have authority, but that authority is granted to them by the team.   On the other hand Scrum Guide says:      Scrum Teams are self-organizing and cross-functional. Self-organizing   teams choose how best to accomplish their work, rather than being   directed by others outside the team.   During the retrospective, the whole Scrum Team (including SM) decides about improvement in the process they will introduce.  Question(s):  So is it like this that :  1.Scrum Master decides that a change will be applied (becuase he has the authority to do so - authority granted by the team). And the team members follows this change, because they trust SM and have respect to SM role. So SM says: “I’ve decided we do this and that”  or  2.Scrum Master just proposes the change and then the team makes the decision that they commit to introduce this change? SM says: “What do you think if we try to do this and that?”  And what if they do not want this change - he cannot force them to do so, and he can “only” remind of goals and try to convince to follow a change? "
1720,"Are Agile and Scrum proprietary names and methods, and who is entitled to sell them (train & certify)?","I would like to know if Agile and Scrum are proprietary names and methods, and if any company can freely use them as part of their marketing, and sell them - I am thinking mainly of consulting services and training providers.  Regarding Agile:   I have come across the Agile Alliance, the DSDM certification, as well as the new PMI Agile certification. Which ones (are there others?) are deemed worth taking and is there a ""best"" one? (By ""worth taking"", I mean certifications that have some value recognition in the industry and are sought by employers)? There seems to be a fair number of Agile training providers out there: are they supposed to be affiliated to some kind of alliance or institute, or can anyone call themselves an Agile coach?   Note: I have reviewed questions already asked on this site about the value of PMP and Scrum Master certifications, my questions above are about Agile specifically.  Regarding Scrum:   Is the Scrum Alliance (www.scrumalliance.org) the sole official body governing Scrum training and certifications such as CSM, CSPO and CSP (is it to Scrum what PMI is to PMBOK/PMP)?  Do companies and consultants providing Scrum training need to be registered education providers, particularly with regards to Scrum certification preparation courses?  "
1721,How to label convergence of simultaneous tasks in PERT chart?,"I am trying to create a PERT chart to show the application of Agile to a certain workflow.  There is a node which diverges into 4 parallel edges/nodes, representing 4 tasks which are completed simultaneously.   The results from all 4 simultaneous tasks are then used in the next step, so 4 edges converge from 4 nodes into 1 node, which represents the next task/milestone.  However, since there are 4 edges coverging to 1 node, it's unclear to me as to how to label it. There's only 1 task being done in that next step, but I have 4 edges and each edge is supposed to be labeled.   Should I write the same thing 4 times? or only label 1 of the 4 edges? "
1722,Requirements management software for mere mortals,"I would like to discuss with you a special case of requirements management. I call it “requirements management for mere mortals”.   I had worked as a project manager in a small web development company.  Significant part of my daily job was talking with our clients to  translate their wishes into the tasks for our developers.   The problem I faced is that most of the approaches and tools I used  previously simply did not fit.   The root cause is that I had to work with  completely non-techie stakeholders who do not care about requirements.   Another issue is a large volume of data. I had to organize info on dozens of small projects each month.   While I have adapted to the process in general there is an issue that I did not manage  to overcome – software. It seems that there is no such thing as  “RQ management software for mere mortals”.   There are tools like DOORS, Polarion and ton of other RQ systems targeted to  enterprise (read terribly expensive and complicated) but there is nothing for a small business.   Here is a list of my wishes for a simple RQ management system:    Web interface Each RQ is a separate entity with unique ID Each RQ is versioned (I should be able to see who changed what) RQs have tags for easy navigation/grouping A list of RQs (current state of RQ document) can be tagged/baselined Instant full-text search through all versions Primitive access control (as simple as “read/write” permissions) Built-in comments/chat to quickly discuss RQs in context Simple markup language support like Markdown instead of bloated rich text editor.  Integration with email (i.e. I can discuss RQ via email but the message will be imported/stored in the system) Export of RQ document to the PDF or other commonly used format There should be no traceability or other features that regular user has no idea about. Basic links (i.e. ""related RQs"") between RQs would be enough. Extremely minimalistic and straightforward UI so any user familiar with GMail will be able to use/understand it from the first sight.    To summarize, I want something like Basecamp but targeted exclusively to requirements  gathering process from regular people.   Did some of you experience the problem described above?  Do you find yourself in a need of such software or you are perfectly fine with MS Word/Excel?  Edit: in response to angeline answer  I totaly agree with your recommendations but I do not have an issue  with customers not getting RQ management.  I am having problem on my side - it is hard to manage RQs when working  under certain conditions.  Even if there is no strict process (e.g. I am an independent IT consultant and decide for myself) you still have to take RQ management serioulsy.  For example, right now I have 350+ email messages regarding one of the projects. Now I need to find some specific RQ to take a decision. Even with  smart features like labels and buit-in search in GMail it is incredibly hard to work with. Note that this is not a single issue - there are different problems with small projects as well.  If you have an Excel or Word document you will face with another issues:   Changes tracking - can you effectively see who changed what in an Excel sheet? Versioning - having 10 version of a document doesn't make you life easier You still can't prevent customer from sending you info via email which quickly  makes your document out of date. Collaboration - tossing MS Word document around is not a joy etc.   In my opinion, software described above can solve all of these issues. On customer side  it will be either plain old email messages or some simple web UI like one we have on stackexchange.com sites.  The obvious benefits are:   all information will be in one place and I will be able to  easily manage it there will be little or no effort for customer to use this system   Edit 2: in response to Adam Wuerl comment:  Currently, I am using Redmine for requirements management. I think that bug tracker is the closest approximation of ideal tool described above. The problems with bug trackers is that they are either non-customizable (to the degree I need) or too flexible (read complicated).   I asked this question in the LinkedIn Requirements Engineering group and of the members has recommended to use Trac.  Unless there is a simple RQ management system available, customized bug tracker would be a good choice. "
1723,"""Extra"" Tasks Mid-sprint","Typically in scrum environments the collection of tasks scheduled to go into a sprint in the sprint planning meeting should be considered fairly ""fixed"".  That is, once the sprint starts, the work agreed to shouldn't change, otherwise you run the risk of having work not get finished in the sprint, you create distractions, etc.  My question though is what about times when a developer takes the initiative to (on his/her own spare time outside of work) solve a ticket that they feel passionate about.  Should that ticket be considered as part of the sprint, or should it be left out?  Context for my question: I'm a developer and over the weekend was spending a bit of time looking at our backlog, and stumbled across a couple extremely small tickets.  Since they were trivial (combined the two tasks took less than a half hour) I just did them.  Now, should those tickets be considered part of the current sprint for reporting purposes, or should they be left out? "
1724,Individual accountability on agile projects,"My organization has been doing waterfall for many years, but we are dipping our toes in the agile pond currently.  So far we have had a couple successful projects using agile so everyone is gung ho about it.  However, upper management has some concerns about the lack of individual accountability.  In waterfall, it is very easy to see that there are tasks with due dates that are assigned to individuals that are either delivered on time or not.  And this data is used in part for end-of-year reviews, bonuses, etc.  Agile shifts the accountability away from the individual and toward the team.  The team either delivers the stories for a given sprint, or they don't.  Management is having trouble figuring out how to get the individual performance metrics they want out of the agile process.  They need a way to see which people on their staff are high performers and which aren't.  But the only place where individual assignments are made in agile is a sticky note on a Scrum board, which doesn't have any upward visibility or historical tracking.  What are the techniques for tracking individual accountability when using agile?  Will this level of tracking hurt the team mentality that agile seeks to create?  How can we meet the needs of management of knowing the relative strength of their staff members, while still focusing on the team accountability with agile? "
1725,How do you handle new tasks in an earned value analysis chart?,"Earned Value Analysis is great on paper. However, I'm having difficulty using it for programming projects that tend to change dramatically from week to week.  For example, a milestone is ""complete test plan 2 on accounting package"", however, in the first half hour of the test plan, the tester discovered an unrecoverable bug. Fixing the bug is 3+ weeks worth of work that was never in the work break down structure. The programmer says, ""oh yeah I forgot to include that task"" when we made the task list.   So, how do you handle this? Do you create the chart so that your project is now a month behind schedule and a month over cost because the WBS was incomplete? Hard to swallow when the entire project is 6 weeks long. Or, do you adjust the planned value to include this new 3 weeks worth of work thus creating a new project plan?  To further extend the question, how do you handle disagreements about the meaning of a work item. The programmer says it's done. The stake holder explains why the three legged cat is missing a leg and the programmer says, oooh you wanted 4 legs?? Well, that's going to take an additional 3 weeks. The new cat will have more value with the extra leg... but the project will take 3 weeks longer than estimated. How do you handle this? "
1726,How several teams should work on one product using Scrum?,"Problems:   A team should be able to do the increment. But with multiple team the product may become unstable because the changes from different teams may create code or functional conflict. Who should solve this problem and how? We have no architect role (all members are developers without additional titles), and code quality rules may be different in teams. One of the teams may always add technical debt to the product and the other teams will suffer from it. How to solve this problem?   Assumption: project is a big monolith application with tight coupling. "
1727,Is there any project planning software out there for Windows that doesn't look ugly?,"   Possible Duplicate:   Is there any project planning software out there for Windows that doesn&#39;t look ugly?       I realize this may sound biased, but I really like Windows in some respects. I just have been spoiled by Apple for so long that if something looks like it was designed by a programmer instead of a designer, I can't bring myself to use it on a daily basis. I've looked at all kinds of options, even the expensive ones like Microsoft Project. They all boast the same sparse interface, populated with thin, hard-to-see bars that are drawn in flat colors from a very limited palette. Has anyone found something that they enjoy using that looks a little more... I don't know... together? Professional? "
1728,"How can we track the status of very large, very broad user stories in our web development process?","I'm looking into using user stories for our next web project. For example:     There will be a homepage with some information and the latest projects for the client.   How could you turn this into one user story? And it has to be designed by a designer, then developed...But if this is only one card how can we track this on the board so we can tell if the designer currently designing it or if someone is developing it? "
1729,"How do ""action items"" relate to various task identification and tracking methods used by agile methodologies?","I'm specifically thinking about the relationship between action items and various methods of organizing tasks in agile methodologies, such as user stories. I think this requires a little bit of a leap, but I don't think it's too off-base.  My understanding of an action item is that it is something that needs to be done. It could be a task to write a document, review a document, implement functionality, write a test case, prepare a presentation, send an email, sign a document, and so on. An action item is also something that can be handled by (and is assigned to) a single individual.  As I understand it, a user story is a requirement in the form of ""As a {role}, I want {output} so that {benefit}"". Quite simply, it's a representation task. Usually, user stories are used to capture the functional requirements of a system, and then someone will use this requirement to implement a solution. However, I see nothing in this definition that precludes it from capturing non-functional requirements (""As a user, I want this program to respond to {input X} within 1 second so that I can complete this task within the deadlines."") I also don't see a reason why stories can't be written for internal tasks as well (""As a project manager, I want a regular status report on the health of this project to determine scheduling, budgeting, and risks."" -> realized through things like daily standups or weekly status meetings).  I came across the INVEST mnemonic when searching about this relationship between action items and user stories. It means that user stories must be independent (self-contained), negotiable (changed up to the time they are added to an iteration), valuable, can be estimated, appropriately sized (4-40 or 8-80 rule?), and testable. I disagree that all stories must be independent (some features or tasks do depend on others existing first) and testable (you can't necessarily ""test"" a presentation in the development sense, but it can be reviewed and assessed, so it might be close). It seems like with the exception of independent and testable, the same rules should apply to an action item.  Ultimately, the question is: Are ""user stories"" and ""action items"" (and any other methods of task identification and tracking) generally interchangable? It seems like a good task is a good task, regardless of how it's presented, and the only significant difference between the two is how they are formatted and presented. Is the only consideration which presentation of tasks bests suits the project and team, and maintaining consistency (in the format used to express tasks) throughout the project? "
1730,How many people during the initial meeting with the client?,"We're a small team (2 developers and 2 designers), experimenting with Agile. Tomorrow is our first big meeting with a new client.     I'm wondering, How many people do you include in the Meeting?    If making user stories and discussing the design options is something the whole team is involved in, do you add everyone to the meeting as well? Or do you include them after the client meeting and explain the business requirements?  Curious about your ideas on this topic. "
1731,How does a PM in Prince2 fit in the Scrum story?,"A colleague and I had a discussion a few days ago on where a PM in a Prince2 project would be placed when the product delivery is done using Scrum.  I wonder what your thoughts are:   who should the PM communication be to, taking into account the different roles in Scrum? How much or in what way should the PM be involved in the product delivery?

1732,"In Kanban, What should I do if the card has a bug that need to be fixed in Test column?","Let's say the workflow is something like this:  Todo -> Development -> Test -> Release  If some feature has done in development and moved to test, when tester found a bug, may be app crashing or similar things, what should I do to that card? Is it the right way to leave that card in there and developer need to stop his current development to fix it first? If so, does this mean that developer has to prioritize this test first (to let the flow be able to continue.) and developer must be interrupted all over the time to clear the bug in test? Is this really better than move the card that has bug back to todo phrase? "
1733,Handling difficult customers,"Questions  How to reject customer requirement/highlight to them that is outside our job scope even though they feel we are able to do it?  How to explain to customer why our charges is higher when they receive a cheaper quotation by others company? Most of the time I believe the client did not provide full job specifications to the service provider.   How to explain to customer that we are going to charge him for the additional requirement.  They might think that that is just a minor changes but in fact there are quite a lot of minor changes add up and used a lot of time to fullfill his requirement.  Background  I would like to have your advices on how to handle difficult customer. I am not complaining about the customer but just want to learn a professional way to avoid similar incident occur in future.   I have developed a custom CMS website for my boss's friend. The job I have done so far include:    Logo design Custom template Content update (Copy Paste from M. Words up to 50 pages+) Basic SEO Based on Google optimization guide (Submit sitemap, etc.) 3 custom form (Application form/training form/contact form)   I used 1 month to design and developed the website. Also I have offer the customer with 1 month free website maintainance which include small changes or content update to the site.  Basically it would be a simple job and we can done all the requirements within 1 month. Unfortunately, the customer can't provide the full details upfront. Initially, he just send us a hardcopy form and ask us to develop according to the form. After we have developed, then he told us to make some changes to the form. So we follow exactly and update the form. This process keep going round and round and every time he also got new small request to add on.   Just the changes to this form and while waiting for his feedback has already spend for a month.   Also he request us to test certain software and let him know whether it is user friendly and suitable for his business. But we haven't use this software before and it is not in our job scope. I don't know how to reject his request most of the time.   We have charge him for USD 1600++ for the whole project. I feel the price is reasonable for the efforts that we have put it in. Unfortunately he complains to our boss said our charges is very high while he getting the quotation from others is just around $800. Almost half of our charges.   How should I explain to him in this situation.   Also he is expecting us to quote him for maintenance agreement by next week and I am worry if I quote for too less and we receive a lot of changes from him, or quote too high then he complains to my boss again.   If I am not allowed to post this question in this project management section, please feel free to close this thread. I welcome any and all criticism and advices. Thank you.  I have read this and found it useful. What are the techniques to elicit requirements from customers who don&#39;t understand their needs? "
1734,What process changes can I make to more accurately track both collaborative stories and individual time within Jira?,"I'm currently working with an organization that is using the Jira Tempo Timesheets plugin to track developer time, but the way that Jira stories and tasks are being used fails to capture overhead accurately without a lot of manual tweaking.  For example, if the team has a user story with two tasks:   Two people might collaborate on one of the tasks. If both people log work on the task, it doubles the time Jira thinks the task took. One person might spend two 30-minute blocks working on a task, but two hours blocked.   The unblocking process (e.g. making calls, chasing resources, holding meetings) could theoretically be allocated towards the blocked task, but then the dashboard (especially the Agile view) looks really skewed. Not allocating that time towards the blocked task hides details about lead time, and makes the level of effort look smaller than it was.  Sometimes an activity could be charged against multiple tasks/subtasks, but entering it in both causes the roll-up values to be ridiculously large and ultimately misleading. On the other hand, splitting the time between separate activities that just happen to share a common dependency makes it look like task performers have spent half the time they really did to complete something.   In short, I'm not sure how to reconcile Jira as a epic/story or task/subtask tool (especially for collaborative user stories) with its organizational role as the ""source of truth"" for individual time sheets.   While I personally think Jira is not the right tool for a truly Agile process, especially for projects that follow Scrum or XP, that's not my decision to make. I just need a better process for tracking work, billable hours, and cycle time within Jira.  What process changes can I make so that the time allocations to stories/tasks are meaningful at the executive level without  making it look like every calendar week consumes 300 man hours of each person's time? And how do I make Jira account for process overhead, so that time allocated to specific activities (which is often smaller than the actual elapsed time to reach the Definition of Done) doesn't ignore the real cost of completing the stories? "
1735,How can I see 'next available' tasks in MS Project?,"I'm used to creating project checklists in software such as OmniFocus, which shows me 'next available' tasks: those that are available now, aren't deferred, whose predecessors have been completed, etc.  I've just built a fairly simple schedule in Project, and I want to see the same. From the ~100 activities, which can I do right now?  I can't seem to generate such a simple list. I've played around with the Reports but none of them are right. I can filter based on date in the task list view but it feels like Project should do this for me. Can it? "
1736,What is the best way to get a UX/UI team to adopt standards?,"We're a team of around 4 UI Developers, 1 Designer and 2 UX. We work on a series of ongoing projects and every month or so, we start a new small project from scratch. All projects are owned by the company we work for.  Up until now, when a new project started, the UX and Design team started almost from scratch. There are no standards regarding typography, font sizes, margins, paddings, button colors and so on.  There is no brand consistency between our projects right now. We can't allocate time to start a ""branding"" project. What we can do is decide on standards as we go.  My question is, what is the best way you can think of to start organizing the team to slowly adopt design standards? Where and how would you share it and make sure the team knows about it. What would you include in the standard?   The time frame would be 2~3 weeks while working on other projects. Higher management does not consider this a priority. "

1741,Present a document with estimations of duration of work and risks,"Two months ago, I joined a software development company. They have just assigned me my first big task that consist in overhauling all the front end of one of our Rails apps. The project is still in the design department, but I will start to work on it soon.  The problem is that management asked me the typical ""when you will finish"". The truth is that I have no idea. Writing the HTML and CSS is not really complicated, but the controllers are a mess and I expect to discover lots of problems.  In this two months I've seen quite a lot of peers sleeping under the desk - this is Japan - and this is something I am obviously not going to accept, so I want to make the risks clear before even starting.  This is what I thought I will write once I get the definitive design:    Project: Redesign of X app.  Scope of the project: - Write all the templates of the new design using HAML language: X lines of   code affected. - Write all the new stylesheets using X framework: X lines of code    affected. - Refactor controllers and correct possible inconsistencies: X lines of    code possibly affected.  Description of tasks: - Page 1:      x hours est. - Page 2:      x hours est. - Page 3:      x hours est. - Component 1: x hours est.  ...  Total estimation of project duration: XXX hours.  Risks: - This is the first time that we replace all the front end of the   application. All the estimations have been done without having a    real example to compare, but when we added Page5 and Page6  in the    Issue #xxxx, took x hours work. This is the metric I am using to predict   the duration of the tasks. - I have detected some issues in the controllers' code that will necessarily   have to be addressed while performing this project. Other unknown issues   are expected to arise.  For this reason, I predict _high probability of deviations_ on the original estimation that I think should be taken into account.   Appart from the awful grammar (feel free to edit), is there any other point that should be added to this document?    Also, this text just came out of my head, but I am sure that there are methodologies that are already being used in other companies. Is there an standard way to communicate estimations? Or does this document has a name in Project Management?   Note: This question is cross-posted from Workplace because I didn't know the existence of this portal. Please, tell me if there's any problem with that. "
1742,How to handle hand-outs from one jira project to another?,"there! First time user here!  Given that we have three Jira projects:   USERS, which users use to enter issues; BACKEND, which is internal to our backend team; FRONTEND, which is internal to our Frontend team   Our flow today is as follows:   User enters a ticket into the USERS project The PM creates two linked issues: one for the BACKEND project, and one for the FRONTEND project. The PM links the BACKEND ticket as ""blocks"" the FRONTEND ticket. Both the BACKEND and the FRONTEND tickets go into the usual backlog/sprint process   My problem today is on the handout process. The FRONTEND team has to wait for the BACKEND team to finish their work on their ticket. When the first team is done, they tell the FRONTEND team, and the frontend team will start working on their part of the job. This, of course, is not optimal, because the first team will often forget to tell the other team after they are done. It's up to me to keep an eye on their tickets to see what's marked as RESOLVED and then trigger the start of the work on the Frontend court.  How can we do this better (without re-engineering the whole organization and the way our teams are organized)? Is there any way to automate this handout with Jira?  Thank you a lot!  Some remarks:  1. Both teams are already big enough to be separated. One big team would be too big to be properly managed.  2. I'll add more remarks as I think of them ;) "
1743,Interpretation of 'negative lag' between tasks,"I'd like to get your opinion on how you think, intuitively, 'lag' on a depency between two tasks works or should work. To make my point I will start with some examples that are no problem, and hopefully when I get to the one that my question is about, it will demonstrate where the disagreement between me and my collegue is :)  Let say we have two tasks, A and B, and B can only start one week after A is finished:   This is, I think, not controversial.  Now a variation: B should start 1 week before A will finish.    This is not controversial either, I think.  Now a bit more complicated: B should end at the same time A ends (end->end relationship).    Now we come to the point where I disagree with my collegue. When there is lag between when A ends and B ends, how should the sign of the lag be interpreted? E.g.:    or    To explain in words: do you think, intuitively, that the 'direction' (in time) of lag between two tasks depends on the type of relationship (end->start and start->start go 'forward' in time, start->end and end->end go 'backward') or should a 'positive' lag always go forward in time?  Edit:  (replaced ascii art with screenshots because it doesn't seem to work on IE) "
1744,Changing backlog story point estimates mid way through a release,"Background: We are mid-way through a development which was estimated for a customer on a fixed price contract. To come up with the estimate we built a backlog by trying to list all user stories and then gave them a story point estimates.  We also tried to come up with an overall time estimate by taking certain stories, breaking them up into tasks of days/hours and then scaling the time to story point ratio up to the entire backlog. Because the technology and framework being used was not familiar to the development team (I know, I know...) the estimates ended up being more of a gut feeling guess. We did run spikes but they weren't entirely useful.  Anyway, now that we are mid way through the team have a much better understanding of the technologies and frameworks in use. We are considering re-estimating (in story points) the remaining items in the backlog.  There is some conflicting opinions in the team and some people feel we will lose track of the original plan and that 'you win some, you lose some' and it will all balance out. But at the same time it would be good to have a more accurate picture of our current progress.  My question: should we change the story points for backlog items once development is underway?  Considerations:   Is this good or bad practice?  If we do this, what calculations should we apply?  Should we re-estimate the entire backlog including completed items, to make the things accurate.  am I over-thinking this? :)  "
1745,"How does one integrate reward systems at an individual level into an Agile landscape, without damaging team cohesion?","I have recently been working and immersing myself in the Agile space. Among other things, I have been inspired by the promise it holds for empowering a team and maximizing efficiency. However, I have had one niggling concern which I am yet to find a concrete solution for: reward schemes and incetivisation.   It is hardly debatable that one of the core focuses of Agile is ""The Team"". Cross-functional teams get together and commit to completing units of work as a team. This often involves testers helping developers and vice versa. Individual lines and roles are blurred in favour of maximising team cohesion. While the team is encouraged to self manage, realistically they cannot be responsible for ultimate reward and incentivisation schemes at an organisational level. Retrospectives are geared towards openness and trust, and are hardly the place to evaluate individual behaviour. However, this system in many ways resembles communism. This is obviously a harsh comparison, yet when I research reward schemes, for individuals who spend long durations in their Scrum/Kanban team, the focus is always team performance and thus comparing two developers from different teams is somewhat futile. While there absolutely is value in moving away from traditional, bureaucratic appraisal methods, I still feel anxious at the prospect of people not being rewarded on an individual basis too.  Thus my question is this: are individual reward systems completely contradictory to agile philosophies (is Agile literally ushering in a completely new paradigm in this respect?) and if not, how does one incorporate individual reward systems into an Agile landscape without completely sacrificing team cohesion?

Only later did i know the beginner tuts/Getting started on Github used the command line and man that's not the way i liked source control system to be, So headed out to SO for answers i got many and did give me extension GUI for managing it but still What next? How do i propogate my new project to Git through Gui and What about readme file does it have to be really ReadMe.MD file. The kind of project is custom extenders, custom controls on asp.net(c#) i would like people downloading the dll[final outcome of project] but i should be the one who decides who joins me in the project and i think this is what github means by Private Repositories[None for free account]. So my question boils down to two points,   Does this kind of project need to be a Private Repository?[not a suggestion/poll kind of answer, i want someone to brief me the problems they faced doing such a thing and benefits] How do i get started, Google didn't give me Full answers to this there are bits thrown all over the place with little info in them.

1747,Remaining Training Budget,"Just wanted to get your opinion on how you would utilize $1,000 by the end of the year for training?  I'm a big agile fan and have received my CSM.  Would it be beneficial to get a CPO as well?  We have a use it or lose it type system when it comes to our training budget, so I want to ensure I maximize this allowance by the end of calendar year.  I've considered the PMP certification, CPO certification, CBAP (business analyst) etc, but just start questioning myself and wanted to hear some other's opinions on the matter. "
1748,How to justify sprints in a largely reactive business?,"We are an agile development team working in a larger business. Many of the other teams (the customer support team in particular) are extremely reactive and often have urgent client issues which need developer assistance.  We have a number of strategies for handling this including a rotating SWAT developer role and leaving a certain amount of contingency where each team member is under planned to account for the enevitible incoming queries and meetings.  The result of this is that most members of the development team have a few User Story's each sprint as well as several Support Tickets they are managing. Interruptions are frequent and the team are finding it extremely difficult to commit to completing their assigned work. I feel this is putting our entire scrum structure at risk.  Other members of the business are increasingly asking why we can't jump on tickets and why they must wait for the next Sprint Planning session to have them assigned (assuming the swat dev can't catch them). I feel for them, why should they have to wait up to two weeks before getting time from the most appropriate developer? On the other hand we owe it to the developer in question to protect them so they have a fighting chance to complete their sprint.  How can we explain to the business that we need the protection a scum structure gives us and can't commit our entire team to reactive support? "
1749,Handling bugs in the Scrum process?,"I have recently gone live with a big project. To meet a tight deadline some technical debt was accumulated but the true extent only became apparent after go live.   As this is intended to be a scalable application, these problems which could be deep seeded into the code have to be resolved.   Should these issues be grouped under user stories / child tech tasks and be accounted for within the sprint process? I think not as it is fixing existing functionality and should be logged as tasks / child tasks outside the sprint process. Or should I add them to account for what the team is doing?   Many thanks.

1750,"Gantt chart that automatically distributes hours across multiple concurrent tasks, and automatically rolls over unprogressed tasks","I'm not sure if a Gantt chart / Gantt software is the wrong tool for my use case, or I'm unaware of some technique / terminology.  Given (1) a set of tasks, (2) time estimated to complete each task, and (3) dependencies to other tasks, I want a view that shows when each task would be completed if a single resource were allocated evenly among all tasks.  Maybe easier to imagine: ""Roughly how much can be accomplished by September given a 1-person team?""  So far I've played around with Teamweek and TeamGantt (advanced trial) with no luck. These seem to require manually assigning hours or tasks per day per resource, whereas I want that assignment done automatically, rolling over incomplete tasks (e.g. unexpected sick day) automatically as well, so that I always see a forecast of completion.  Are Gantt charts the wrong tool? Or is there some technique or term I'm missing? "
1751,"Handling non-team working, good programmers","Let's say, you have a project and a very good team. The team leader is a very good programmer, with high professional performances, but without any team-playing competencies and with some non-conformist attitudes. For ex.   arriving late to work, working in the nights (the management politics lets him do this, with having free program at the company). In this case the other members of the team have no possibility to collaborate with him the team has a big number of bug, but the team leader - being the best professional - takes the 85% of them.  has an antisocial style   How should this situation be handled by the project management? Should the whole team adopt to the team leader's habits, the team leader should be moved somehow or both? I mention, that the project manager should take in consideration that the team leader is an antisocial and non-conformist person, with very good professional skills. "
1752,MS-Project: any ideas on how to approach defining a MINIMUM work assignment per day for resources?,"I am currently working on a high level project plan with all our department's projects and resources allocated to each project (roughly like 10% during 2 months, 20% during 2 weeks, etc.). This is to get a rough idea about (over)allocations and free capacities.  In our team it's the culture to ALWAYS make an assignment of any team resources for a MINIMUM of 0.5 person-days (4 hours). Everything below this would be too much micromanagement - and especially on my high level project plan, this would be far too detailed.  What I basically have is 1 Task for each ongoing Project. Those ""Tasks"" are defined as:   Fixed Duration Constrain: start no earlier than DATE XY (each Project's start date) Duration: eg. 2 months Effort driven: NO   To these Projects I assign the according resources with a percentage or work amount. Example:   Project A (Duration: 2 Months, fixed duration) -- Resource A: 80% (= 4 person-days/week) -- Resource B: 20% (= 1 person-days/week) -- Resource C: 10% (= 0.5 person-days/week)   So this works fine, Project is automatically calculating the work hours and dividing it based on the task's duration time. But this also means that I end up with stuff like:   Resource A: 7.24 hours/day Resource B: 0.82 hours/day Resource C: 0.12 hours/day   This is bascially useless for me, because our People just do not work less than 0.5 person-days on a day. So I'd rather have ""Resource B"" work 1 full day or 2 half-days per week, than a little bit every day during a week. I feel like MS Project is pushing me into micromanagement of my resources...  Is it possible to define this kind of calculation-rule in MS Project? Something like telling Project ""do not assign a resource less than 4 hours per day""?  Thanks for any inputs and possible solutions! It might be that I am approaching this wrongly :) ~ Oliver "
1753,How can I make availability of team members visible to everyone?,"I'm working on a team that's distributed across several locations, time zones, and managers. Quite often, some team member needs to know if or or more other team members are generally available, or on leave.  What means can you think of to efficiently make this information available to everyone?  What doesn't work   Individual's Outlook calendar. It's way too clumsy to determine availability of a group of people in this way. You need to start creating a meeting, add the individuals and hope that their calendar is up-to-date. Managers have no easy way of seeing if their team members have put in their vacations. An Outlook calendar shared by someone. Also clumsy, and doesn't work if people move on. Excel. Not really. No concurrent access. The corporate leave management. Not accessible across organizational teams due to missing permissions.   What I don't want/need  Yes, I know there are commercial leave management systems with nice web interfaces. But I don't want to manage people's leave -- that's what HR does. I only want to make leave known to other team members. For instance on Confluence, but how? "
1754,"Why is customer churn rate calculated in relation to users at the beginning of a period, not people at beginning plus acquired?","Let's take the customer churn definition from this article, that I have also seen in other sources.     Let’s do the maths with one example: On January 1st you have 1000 customers. 100 of them are not using your service at the end of the month anymore. Furthermore you have acquired throughout January (31st of January) 500 new customers where 125 directly churn out. Simplest calculation looks as follows: (100 + 125)/1000 = 0.225   Why do we divide by 1000? Wouldn't it make more sense to divide by the total amount of users in period, 1500? "
1755,"How to detect in recruitment, engineers that are not self-organized","I am facing a problem with some engineers and I want to know if is possible to detect some characteristics during the interviews or through some test.  In my company (a software house), we are hiring software engineers. We have some tests, mostly about programming skills and we are introducing some assessment tests too.   I have detected that some engineers require too much effort to manage them. The following can be a kind of characterization:   The engineer doesn't follow all the required instructions written down in a procedures document (even short ones) The engineer needs to be frequently asked if they follow the steps that some issue requires (like creating a profile following instructions) There is a public channel where the team post important links to follow and news, and this kind of engineer tend to not read and follow links to important issues, even for themselves. Even if the manager of these engineers is not a micromanager, he/she seems to be forced to micromanage them, if not, the tasks are not accomplished.   So the issue is:   How to detect during the recruitment steps, that you are dealing with this kind of engineer? How to detected that the engineer requires some kind of micromanagement (to avoid it in fact). Is there any kind of test that can detect some tendency of this in advance?   As Project Manager, I am looking for engineers that are self-organized, that you don't need to push them all the time. "
1756,"What's a more generic, less-loaded name for ""operations""?","I'm trying to help better organize the activities of our group. We're largely a service organization (working with faculty and students at an academic institution), but we're a tech group and we do software development and integration as well.  We had previously tried a ""tools-first"" approach to project and task tracking, and that wasn't terribly successful — the tools became a burden rather than an aid. So I'm trying to think things out from first principles. I don't really have a background or training here, so I'm struggling a bit with the naming of things, and hope you can help.  Here's my conceptualization of the different types of activities we do in a generic sense. There's a lot of ways to divide up activities, but this one is prompted by thinking about the differences in needs for organizing and tracking. Event response needs a ticketing system; that same ticketing system might not be the best for project tracking, or for the ""blue"" category as explained below.    Event response is activity prompted by something external: an e-mail for help or walk-in request, or, a system disk failure or security breech. Either way, these are hard to plan for except as estimates; they tend to be short lived, and require immediate response of some kind. (Making sure time and people are budgeted for these things is important, though, since they really do serve our group mission and mustn't feel like distractions or interruptions.)  Unavailable is something the higher-ups thought looked badly on the chart, but basically is an acknowledgment that people have sick days and vacation and other interruptions. It helps me to keep that in mind, even if it ultimately doesn't go into presentations of what our group does.  Exploration/Learning is training and individual exploration of new technologies and ideas. We need to be up on these things as a group so this is important.  Project development is where we work to enable new services or improve existing ones. We also do some consulting-style work which seems best managed as small projects. We have work to do in areas around process here, but I've got a lot of good ideas on how to move forward.  So, Daily operations are where I keep running into a language problem. I mean ""the stuff one does as part of keeping our services running"", but not just in a technical sense. Some of this is reading logs, checking server status, and so on, but I also mean for it to encompass teaching a seminar, meetings with our users. And I don't mean it to include many of the things that are generally included under ""operations"" in the IT sense. Racking a server, for example, is probably part of a project to deploy some new or upgraded service; changing a failed disk is event response. A general characteristic of things in this category is that they are continuously ongoing, but are not externally prompted. We can usually ignore or avoid working on these things for a time, at a cost of accrued technical or social debt — we can avoid reading logs, but may need to suddenly pay when there's an incident later which we weren't aware of. We can avoid scheduling meetings with faculty with no immediate consequences (but probably serious longer-term ones).  So, what's a good thing to call this last category of activity? I really want to avoid ""operations"", but can't think of anything better. "
1757,What to do when you have successfully delegated all the work and nothing is left for you?,"Imagine a small software development team (say, 5 members). Having done your homework as an Agile manager and closely following Jurgen Appello's suggestion of ""the more you empower your team, the better"", you one day find your team having progressed so far that it doesn't seem to need you any more at all.  From my point of view, Jurgen's proposal: ""Level 7: Delegate: You leave it entirely up to the team to deal with the matter, while you go out and have a good time."" ... of going home might not be feasible, since it could have a bad impact on general team motivation when the PM just stays away.  Of course, you clearly don't want to look over everybody's shoulder all the time, micro-management a bad thing and so on.

1759,Should single user story contain estimations for each involved guild in full-stack development team,"Problem  We're working in a full-stack development team composed of three guilds (backend, frontend, QA), so as a team we share a single sprint board. User stories we take into our sprints are written in a way that they may require work from at least one or multiple guilds.   So far the story received single estimation as a composition of votes for all involved guilds. But this way we're unable to tell how heavy the story will be for every single involved guild, which causes us complications in sprint planning meetings and later on in sprints.  Imagine you want to maximize the team effectivity by minimizing down-times of each guild. Because (not every, I know) user story can be worked on in parallel by multiple guilds, you can do that by selecting such stories to sprint where summary of estimations for each guild gives closest capacity of that guild. You mustn't, of course, forget to count with dependencies between stories.  Question  Is it OK for single user story to have estimations for each of involved guilds? And if so, is Jira (cloud) able to deal with that? Does anyone have any personal experience?  Note  We also thought about estimating only sub-tasks, not user story itself, but we rejected that because this would inflate the estimation unreasonably.  Imagine single story with work required by all three guilds. In refinement the story receives following estimations (3 SP: backend, 1 SP: frontend, 2 SP: QA). The guilds agree on single estimation of 5 SP and give this to the user story. Sub-tasks for each guild are left unestimated (with estimation zero).  In opposition when the story itself would not receive any estimation (zero), but sub-tasks for each guild would receive their respective estimations. This would give unreasonably higher SP count (here 6 SP instead of 5 SP in the first case), because you'd have to sum all SPs for each sub-task. "

Is it reasonable to include risks such as the building burning down or major storm knocks out power for 6 weeks? While the probability of these events is low, their severity is extremely high, making them seem like candidates for the risk log.

1765,How to use Kanban with small tasks?,"I recently introduced Kanban in our software development team, but I'm struggling with some things. The main problem I have is how to handle 'small tasks'?   Let me explain some background: We develop some products which are used by several clients. Some clients use our generic product, and some clients have some customized things.   Let's take a practical example from this week. We released the beta version a web-application to a client of us. This client did a test run, and delivered us all his little remarks. In total about 30 point or so. But this points are really small like 'move the logo 10px up', 'change the order of the list'..  How can I handle this on my Kanban board? This is how our current board looks like. The green card is a feature (to be defined userstory), the yellow ones are tasks.     If I create a task for every point of the client's feedback, my board will be overloaded (I have a WIP of 6 in the selected column). The separate tasks will only take some minutes to fix. And also, is it bad to skip some steps of the Kanban board? It doesn't need an analysis or so..  So my question is: do I need to bundle small tasks into 'fixes client x'? Or how to handle such things? "

1767,Should we finalize the user story or UI design first?,"I am currently working as product owner in a firm where we follow agile methodology. I would like to discuss about a scenario faced in my daily work life.   We have started working on a project to implement a new report in our product. I proposed a design and shared with UI team. Then i started writing user stories based on my proposed design. The proposed UI design was finalized by chief product officer. But during the product refinement meeting, the Development team suggested a totally different UI design. This creates an extra work to update the stories based on that design.  So my questions are   What is the best time to start writing stories ?  Should we finalize the UI design first instead of writing stories ?  Is it fine to start working on stories after finalizing the UI design ? Is there any suggestion which can be followed to avoid the similar issues in future ?  "
1768,Inter team dependencies in one story,"What is the best way to handle task dependencies inside one story? The story itself is independent from other stories and we do have cross functional teams (design, backend, frontend).  For most tasks - especially at the start of a project - frontend work is usually blocked by the backend and design work.   Let's say that we want to implement a login story:     As a customer I want to log in to be able to access the private parts of the site   This story has a three parts:   Login form design Backend API implementation Frontend implementation (with styles and connecting to backend)   So, tasks #1 and #2 can be done in parallel, while task #3 is dependent on both of them.  They also have very different effort levels needed for the completion.  My questions are:   When doing estimate, should each part be estimated separately? How to calculate ""total"" estimate? How to avoid spillover? If most of the tasks are entangled like this, it is possible that few tasks will be done-done, since the work is serial instead of being parallel How to commit on something that is so uncertain (other people's work)?   I've read most of the topics that mention dependencies, but couldn't find a good solution to this problem "
1769,Disallow tasks to be marked as complete until dependencies also complete,"I would like to create tasks and indicate their dependencies. Lots of software does this but I would like it to only allow a task to be marked as complete when all its dependencies are also marked as complete.  This seems a really basic need but MS Project doesn’t do it and neither does any other software, as far as I can tell. One partial solution in Project is to use headings and put subtasks within, but that constrains you to categorising work in one particular way. One task might be dependent on tasks from different categories.  How do others get round this limitation? Are there any pieces of software that can do it? (For my particular need right now, even a simple to-do list without resourcing and dates would be fine.) "
1770,How to manage business and technical requirements?,"According to Gojko Adzic book ""Specification by example"" we have to separate business and technical requirements. In our company we have tech req's in Given/When/Then format.   How about business requirements? What should this type of requirements contain? What is the best way to manage and maintain it? As a project manager should I be responsible for delivering and maintaining both? "
1771,What are some approach in making the customers happy If deadlines are not met and I cannot provide accurate updates due to internal process?,"All. I work in an environment wherein programmers get their tasks from a queue and resources are being managed by a line manager. I use an application to log the work needed for the project and the line manager is responsible for the distribution of the work.   As a Project Manager, I do not have the authority over the resources but only the logged work by assigning it their team queue. This is very challenging on my part because they cannot provide an ETA accurately for deviation happens such as delays, resource allocations, unexpected changes, prioritization from upper management, and so on.   What is the best approach in managing the customers expectation when things are not going as planned? I know communication plays a critical role but is there any other way to turn around things. In situations like this,what should I remember and keep in mind? "
1772,Your opinion: Attention to Detail Skills and PM,"Do you think attention to detail skills inhibit, enable, or does nothing for one's ability to be an effective project manager / leader?  And why?  EDIT:  @Angeline and Ian: What about the intrinsic skill or innate ability of attention to detail?  By personality, some of us are weed thinkers, some tree thinkers, and some forest thinkers, meaning we have intrinsic strengths to be naturally in one of these categories.  While each of us to some degree can choose to move up and down in our thinking, is there anything around the constitutional personality trait that would either enable or inhibit our ability to be great leaders?  Or do nothing to enable or inhibit? "
1773,How should I account for non-coding time when estimating duration of a coding task?,"I was wondering whether this approach I am doing to scheduling dev work on a day to day basis is correct. In which I assume that instead that a developer has 8 hours a day to do coding, they actually have less.  Situation:   I already have list of specs and broken them down to appropriate tasks and estimated hours to complete them. Now I want to fit these tasks and their appropriate hours in the calendar so I can find the dates on when these specs can be completed.   My thinking is that assuming a standard 8 working hours a day is flawed because one does not always code 8 hour straight. So after taking into account for non-code time involved for my team and myself such as   Daily scrum (0.5) Lunch (1.0) Misc Meetings/Discussions (1.0)   I would assume that a developer would really only have on average 5 - 5.5 hours of solid work. So I am scheduling on that assumption. Would this be the right approach or a better way to take into account non-coding time? Because simply saying that someone has a day to finish Spec X doesn't mean they have 8 hours to finish it, isn't it? "
1774,How to define Budget in Project Charter when Cost is unknown?,"I need to write a Project Charter for an IT Project. The work will be completed by external consultants. The technology being implemented is cutting edge and therefore we have no previous projects to use as a basis for estimating budget. I am told that correct PM process means I cannot go out and get some quotes until the Project Charter is in place (because in order to get quotes we would have to commit alot of resource to define the detailed requirements that the consultants would need to quote against). I have no idea if they charge £1000/day or £10,000/day and I have no idea what the timelines would be. Surely I need to get some quotes before I write the Project Charter?  So the question is - How to define Budget in Project Charter when Cost is unknown?  Thanks  Tim "
1775,How should a project manager handle a request for contracted software to produce twice as many reports as specified in the project's requirements?,"I have joined a late-phase software project and there is a great deal of disagreement between my management and the client about work items they are claiming to be outstanding. In short, our business requirements document (BRD) describes three reports that the software needs to produce, but the statement of work (SOW) simply says that the software will support ""reporting"". Now the client is asking us to create six additional reports and says that it is covered because the SOW says that the software will be used to produce reports.  My PM training has taught me that the BRD definition of a subject will supersede a SOW definition as the purpose of the SOW is to be abstract and the BRD is concrete. However, management at my company are wavering and agreeing that they can see the client's point of view. I think this is gold plating, pure and simple.  Strictly speaking as a project manager, who is technically correct here? Can the SOW's abstractness be used to redefine BRD scope definition or is the BRD and software requirements specification (SRS) considered the definitive word on in/out of scope items? "
1776,How to cope with milestones that can only occur every two weeks?,"In MS Project... I have a project that will ultimately be released by a third party, who have their own, fixed release schedule. The releases happen every two weeks. How can I attach the end of the software development phase to the next available release date?   Can Project automatically find the nearest release date (a milestone?) and attach the task to that one? Or do I have to do it by hand every time the timelines change?  I'm using MS Project 98 on Windows XP  Thanks! "
1777,Would having the CAPM help me get a job at an Aerospace and Defense company?,"   Possible Duplicate:   Is PMP certification an appropriate career goal for someone about to start a career in project management?       Is a PMI certification like the CAPM (for people having experience in project management) worth getting if I'm looking for a first job at a company like Boeing, Airbus or Lockheed Martin? "
1778,"Does a user story need to be small and why, when using Kanban","User Stories are generally written using INVEST method; the E meaning easier estimation which does not apply to Kanban and S meaning small enough to fit into iteration which also does not apply to Kanban.   The rule of thumb is generally that a story should move through the system in 2-3 days.   I can’t find out why though.   If user stories need to be small for Kanban, why do they need to be small?   Is the reason due to WIP limits? This is even more confusing since WIP limits are empirical.   "
1779,Last minute changes by the client,"We have a team that works in Scrum and a PO who prioritizes the backlog. Outside of this, we have 3 project managers that hold the communication with our clients (each one with 2-3 different countries). They (instead of the PO) are the communication point with the clients. Also we have a chief PM, who holds the overall roadmap of all the projects. The team estimates and does a little bit of each project's work in each sprint, depending on then deadlines and priorities.  However more often than not, a client will put through some last minute changes, that are not small, and he wants them delivered in 2 days, therefore blowing up the rest of the sprint. This leads us to trying to juggle too many things and compromising in quality at the end.  We tried to bring the clients closer to us to let them understand how we work, but their nature of business is advertising and media, and therefore their response usually is ""the ad goes live in 2 days"". Therefore their product has to be ready in 2 days.  I know this setup is far from ideal, however how do you tackle the ""client"" part with the last minute changes, given that it's only one scrum team that has to cater for everyone?  Or, even better, how do you prove that this is inefficient?  "
1780,"As a scrum master of a small startup made by friends, How do you solve these impediments?","We are a small team of developers(fresh graduates) who have decided to create a software to manage a store.  We have just a small amount of experience in a real world environment of software development.  My idea was to develop this software in an agile way, to deliver it as soon as possible. But two of the developers are arguing about how to define the software's architecture.  Developer 1 : We could use a framework like django rest or something else to speed the development of the API and focus our work on front end / mobile.  Developer 2 : We must use a microframework like falcon to be more versatile also we could use SAM pattern because MVC has some flaws and it sucks.  I know this discussion will not ever end and we'll lose our chance to develop this software since they all only care about planning and documentation.  Also only Developer 2 knows about this 'SAM pattern'.  What do you think?  How would you solve this impediments? "
1781,Strategy for whole team switching tehnologies,"My current company is product based, with an application started 7 years ago but never rewritten, a lot of garbage piled up. Right now, the management decided it's time to rewrite and after a little research we decided to stick to Django and Angular. The issue is that right now there are 12+ developers with experience in PHP and jQuery 1.3.  What would you consider a good strategy for the whole team to switch technologies? Everyone has to learn and of course, quality is expected.   Also, a part of the team would have to support the old application. Which are the best criteria to choose those? Personal option? "
1782,Are these questions valid for a daily scrum?,"For the daily scrum, is it correct to say ""A standup meeting is about answers, not questions""?  Or another statement: ""A standup is to talk about the What, not the How or Why""?  I feel that the ""why"" may play a part in the daily scrum, but has to be controlled so not to take up too much time.  I am in a small- to medium-sized business, trying to teach daily standups.  I am trying to pull together some phrases for everyone to think about when participating in a daily scrum. "
1783,What to do when a developer of a library you've used for a year claims that you owe them license fees?,"Perhaps this is not the right forum to ask this question but this situation has popped up recently and as the project manager, I am responsible for it.  More than a year ago, we developed an app which uses a library that was created by a third party developer. From the marketplace that it was released, it looked like the library was free. In fact, even looking at it now, it does look free.. except for only one page which says the Enterprise edition is not. This library was downloaded 2 years ago so my developer cannot remember whether those terms were added recently.  It is also not clear on that page what are the limits of the free edition which we are using now. At what point should we have upgraded to the Enterprise edition, I don't know. I cannot tell from the terms on that page. I have encountered other paid libraries that offer similar 'free' (or more accurately, trial) versions. After you reach the limits of free usage, those libraries show a message and no longer works. There is nothing like that for this library.   I've also looked at other libraries and it is pretty clear when a library is free and when it is not. In fact, it's also obvious when a library provides a trial version. However, for this library, the word 'Free' appears almost everywhere except for that one page. It seems almost deliberate.  So here we are more than a year in production with that library. Out of the blue, the developer contacts me and tells me I have to pay for the past usage. However, he tells me that if we sign up for a 2-year contract, out of goodwill the past charges will be dropped. Unfortunately the bill for that contract is a substantial amount.  What is surprising is when I asked him why is that for more than a year we weren't informed about this, he refuses to give me an answer. I am sure he wouldn't need a year to realise that we have exceeded the limits of the free edition of his library. Especially when he could tell me the precise usage of the library from the first month the app was launched, and that within that month we had already exceeded the limits.  What is best course of action to take? Our client is the actual user of this app and they will decide whether they will pay for this contract. I have a strong feeling they will rather do without the feature that the library provides than pay such a high fee. In that case, can the developer legally ask me to pay for the past usage? "
1784,How can I calculate how many developers do I need and how long it takes to complete the project?,"I am trying to create an LMS system using Angular and NativeScript. It's a LMS web application like Adobe connect (although a simplified version) that will be written in Angular 8 for example, and a mobile version of it that has a different UI and some different features that will be written in NativeScript-Angular, but is connected to the website and both use one back-end. So the project has 2 front-end interfaces written in Angular and NativeScript-Angular and one back-end that will be written in NodeJS.   As this is my first project (startup), and I am in low-budget, and web/mobile applications aren't my expertise (my expertise is in AI field, but I have some student experiences in mobile/web applications), I need some advice about:   How many front-end developers are needed? How many backend developers? Should I do the job in parallel or I must end up the front-end at first, then go and do the back-end part? How long will it take to finish the work? (I need some estimates)   And many other questions that I will try to ask in comments. "
1785,How to structure a BI team in agile/scrum,"I am about to take a role as a BI Product Owner, but there is some debate as to how to structure the team.  Some of the articles and white papers discuss a BI 'team' but this causes me a few conceptual concerns.  If I read people like Craig Larman (Large Scale Scrum) he advises creating a 'feature team' that works across the stack to create a coherent customer-centric product.  That might include embedded BI to the extent that the customer wanted it and found it valuable.  If so, the feature team might need BI skills, as well as their other cross functional skills to deliver, but at least they would understand the data since it would be part of their app.  However, BI is also a valuable internal product...using customer/app data to deliver customer insights, but also a whole range of internal operational issues that the customer might have no interest in.  If you create a BI team centred on that 'product' then you have diverged from the customer-centric view (at least from a revenue generation point of view) but also you have a team that is not working right across the stack and doesn't work directly with the data.  Does anyone see that as a tension?  Any thoughts/ideas/observations/resources?  All input gratefully received.  Ged "
1786,Real world differences between Portfolio and Program,Can I have a have a project without having a portfolio?  This issue has been slightly touched on in the above link but I am hoping the collective expertise of this community could expand it.  I have been reading PMBoK 5e.  From what I gather the only functional difference between Progam management and Portfolio Management is that programs should be grouped by a common outcome or capability whereas portfolios can contain projects that are drastically dissimilar in goals or requirements.  Also Projects within a portfolio will necessarily share a strategic objective.  Does this reflect the real business world?  Is an organization with projects within programs within one of many portfolios a common structure?    I am wondering if this is an example of jargon for the sake of jargon or if there are enough real world applications of this organizational structure that it is useful to understand it (beyond for testing purposes). 
1787,How to estimate the value of software for a control system?,"Control systems are like computers, but sometimes less so. For the current discussion, it can be assumed that some custom effort maybe needed to make the same code work on different platforms.   With that background, my problem is: how do I estimate the value of my software for a specific control system? For example, if I made the software for a car's control system, how can I go about pricing it? When someone buys a car, how can we know how much they are paying for the software vs. the hardware?   One approach is the Cost of Goods and Services (COGS) approach, where we estimate the effort that went into making that software. Are there any other approaches, that take into account the value added by the software?  i.e. let's say this software does something better than what is currently out there. How can the value estimation process capture such value additions? "
1788,Should a Scrum team formally track daily commitments?,"Should a Scrum team be tracking the daily commitments each team member makes during the Daily Scrum? We write them down in a kind of a mini task manager, and then we mark them as done during the work day.  Is there any benefit to this process? Or is it a drawback and an unnecessary burden? "
1789,What documentation is required for behavior-driven development?,"I have been asked to provide some behavior-driven development documents for a project which has not yet started. This leaves me thinking, ""other than stories yet to be written, what documents are there?""  So, what documents can I provide which are input to a project in order to structure it, prior to the work actually beginning? "
1790,What to do when no more financing is available for a project in PMI,"I wonder what would be the formal procedure and step according to PMI when you realize that your project ran out of money and no more financing from client is available?  I think no other alternative to terminate the project, but project manager is not accountable for that decision.  According to PMI, what should be the next step, and what should the project manager do after once he/she monitored costs, and he/she determined that the project was not more achievable.  Should the PM manager write an issue in the Issue Log and report it to the sponsor, and let him/her take the decision?  I have been googling for this scenario, but no success found. Can you point out a reference in the PMBOK, process or a PMI article to read about it please?  "
1791,Best measurable units for non cross-functional team estimation,"I have a new development team and I want to use Story Points for high-level estimation.  But I have two problems:   My new team is not cross-functional (we are trying to solve this, but this is a slow process). User Stories are very specific and demand detailed knowledge.   So, during Product Backlog Refinement we assume, that in most cases concrete Story will be implemented by a concrete developer. Obviously, only this developer will estimate his Story (because only he has required knowledge).  But Story Point is measurable units for whole team, not for any single person within the team. If we will estimate Stories by a concrete developer, a Story Point of one developer will not be the same as a Story Point of another developer.  So, the question is:   Is it a good idea to use Story Points in my situation? If not, what measurable units are better to use? Old-fashion man-hours / ideal man-hours or something else?  "
1792,How to better structure a big scrum team?,"I have joined a start up company as a PM/ scrum master which had 3 scrum teams with different domain specialty 1-FW/cloud, 2- machine learning, and 3- front end( UX/ UI/ dev/QA) on one backlog. The scrum teams where shaped based on their specialty not cross functionally. Each team has 6 to 9 member means the total of people on these scrum teams are 20. We can't have a one scrum team with 20 people. All these people are working on one product. I have set up the sprint planning with all 20 people together and that solved part of cross dependencies I also set up a product meeting weekly with the leads of each team to review our product milestones. During the sprint teams seem to work separately. How could I solve this issue? I am thinking about scrum of scrum meeting but it means more and more meeting for teams that are already executing an aggressive schedule. Any suggestion?  "
1793,"What's the best way of writing user stories about ""improve this metric"" if I'm not sure how much improvement is possible?","Say you have a piece of software that you know can be improved on various quantifiable metrics (time to boot, CPU and memory usage, latency for various actions, accuracy of recognition tasks, etc.), but you don't know by how much - how would you write User Stories?  Is it better to guesstimate an improvement? (ideally with the team) To just write ""improve such-and-such metric"", without specifying by how much?  (Our organisation is new to Agile and we're trying out Scrum, and I've found we spend a bit too much time discussing these details and the meta topic of how to formulate them, so I'd like to know how others would cover this; we don't have specific formal requirements from our client on those, but know (from UX testing etc.) that those improvements are needed for a better user experience) "
1794,How can we decide if a story is a feature or just an internal change?,"We have a story where we want to have uniformity across our product suite by using a same jar file across three products. Consider it as an add-on to the original product, and as of today we have different versions for different products, due to Java 8 &amp; Java 11 compatibility concerns.   The customer won't know anything once the feature is done. So they just run the software (3 products said earlier) as usual with the latest version of the add on.   Is something a feature only if it is customer facing ? Does a Non Customer Facing Internal update count as a feature too ?  "
1795,Help me reconcile my title of project manager with performing roles of a scrum master,"I am a PMP and I have been assigned to a software development project and given the title of Project Manager. There is no technical project manager for this project and this is a balanced matrix organization where I have a portfolio manager above me and my team is assigned full-time to this project where I am acting as their functional manager (though technically my boss is their boss).  I am doing typical PM stuff like managing scope items, reconciling work items with the BRD/SRS, submitting change requests, and ensuring that we're meeting deadlines. However, we're working in an agile fashion with two-week sprints and the team is trying to behave as ""scrum-like"" as possible. This means daily scrums, prioritized backlog, sprint planning meetings, etc. However, in scrum the role of project manager does not exist, and in some ways a PM role is antithetical to the idea of scrum as a lot of the PMI-isms are built around the concept of a waterfall model. We also do some very non-scrum things, like loosely assign backlog storied a few sprints ahead to ""know what's coming"" and give management a plan for the future.  How can this arrangement be described? What happens when a PM is placed on a scrum team? Is this really just working in an agile manner since we're not adhering to the exact rules of scrum so we can't call it so? (like a sparkling wine made outside of Champagne, France) "
1796,Should I ask developers to report hours in daily reports or ask them to keep the task tracking tool we use with this level of detail?,"I am the IT manager in a company having 30 people in the IT team. There are 3 major teams, each with 7 to 8 people, + few other smaller teams. Different locations, cultures and timezones.  Having progress issues with one of the projects, I am willing to improve the team efficiency.  Until now, we were using OpenProject for project management. It worked well, although the layout is not the best for task presentations.  Now, we decided to switch on Zoho, which is a paid product, offering some widgets like time tracking etc.  Currently, I am asking all team members to send me a daily email report of their activities. I am making a resumee and sending a general report to the  senior management team so that they can have a general overview.  As we will use Zoho now, my idea was to stop asking them to send daily email reports, instead they need to report on Zoho by keeping their tasks updated on daily basis, so we can easily track what an IT did during its day.   Question: Is it better to ask the devs to continue sending the email by adding the amount of the working hours spent on every task, or to ask them to track hours using Zoho and rely on Zoho to assist me in tracking hours? Is the hourly base measuring applicable in IT?  In reality, the reporting workflow of a developer will be:   Update the status of the tasks assigned to me Enter how many hours did I worked on that task on a specific day Update the completion percentage of the tasks  "
1797,What are some specific techniques to keep the daily Stand-up productive?,What are some specific examples that help make a daily scrum productive. I understand that in a daily Scrum meeting the basic questions reviewed are:   What did you do yesterday? What are your plans today? What obstacles do you have in your work now?   In the daily Scrum dialogue what techniques have you found that are best for keeping things focused and moving toward productive work? Thanks. 
1798,How to jump issue sprint to sprint?,"How can we manage the issues that were planned to be done at one sprint, but at the end, it didn't, and has to be done in another. Do I change the Milestone? Do I create a new issue on the new Milestone? Or something else? The biggest problem is knowing when the issue did not fit in the sprint and had to move to the next, without appearing in the reports as if it had been made in Milestone planned. "
1799,How to manage misalignments between Design Specs and After Design Adjustments?,"How do you manage this scenario?   UX and Visual design a feature. PO and DEV decided -after design got approved- to ignore some specs of implementation, so we have something different than the design specs.   Where should be located this information? Because SM ended up with a stakeholder discussion (PO is sick) and after his check of JIRA ticket he saw design and website implementation not aligned. After having created a bug a DEV told him that it was discussed with PO to be implemented like this. So the different design implementation is not reported anywhere.  In my opinion these (ignored) specs update should stay in the design page (Zeplin, Confluence, whatever…). Do you agree? Because otherwise for anyone who losts that info, this scenario may look like a BUG. The missing part then could be turned into a new FEATURE, with again added comments.  Do you agree? What do you think? "
1800,"Agile, peer vs roundtable programming","I am a scrum master of a team and I want to improve learning in between team. We are learning new things every day and I thought that roundtable programming would go a long way. Here is my idea:   We start working on a product\project something that is new We reserve a conference room with a good TV so that we can share our screen. Continue to work on individual tasks in the same project Every time someone gets a query, they would ask team whether they have come across that If yes, the team member would explain why and what to do to get through that obstacle If not, we all debug\analyse and find the solution   We would do this an hour a day at most. I did read about peer programming but that's only two people while working on new project everyone should be able to be on same page so I thought of this (cannot be anything new but I don't know).  Does that sound like a good approach? Has anyone tried this? And if yes, what was the result?  Thanks in advance -V. "
1801,Designing by onshore development/construct by offshore team and estimation,"In our organisation, the technical design for the user stories/requirements is done by the onshore resources in the USA and the actual construct/development (coding) is done by an offshore development team.   We follow 1-week sprints.   The question is: how should the story points be assigned? Should they be assigned by the onshore team for the overall story, or just the development effort? Sometimes the actual designing and gathering requirements can take 2 weeks but the development task can be completed within a week.   So the question by the team is: should story points be assigned only for dev effort or overall? Since overall is beyond the 1-week timeline (as in, designing and getting technical requirements done).  PS: I understand that the above may not be pure Scrum. But given the circumstances, how should one estimate? Should there be different story points just for design and development? "
1802,How to add Definition of Done (DoD) in TFS 2015 Scrum methodology?,I'd like to know: how could I define the Definition of Done of the backlog items in my iteration in Team Foundation Server (TFS) 2015? My projects are based on Scrum methodology.  I know that the Acceptance Criteria is different than the DoD in theory. But I can't find any documentation about DoD in Scrum-based TFS. Should I add them into the Acceptance Criteria of the backlog item or do I have to create a new column in TFS and name it DoD?  Why is it not available by default in TFS? 
1803,Rent total cost prediction,"I have a project management course now. One of points of my project requires me to rent a territory, and I need to include its cost in the project's total cost.   The first thing I thought was to count project's total time and multiply it by monthly rent ($6000). But the professor says the project may crash before finishing, so I can not allocate so much money from the start of the project, and there should be another way.  What is the right solution for this problem? How can I predict total cost of renting? "
1804,Sprint Bouncer role,"Our engineering team uses agile scrum and we are finally growing enough to be able to delegate more scrum roles to more members, including to some of the engineers like myself.  One role we're introducing that I have volunteered for is what we're calling the ""bouncer.""  A bouncer's role in this context is to:    communicate and track support,   investigate incoming issues, and escalate as appropriate   A work queue separate from the sprint is available for bouncers to work during downtime. This queue are small, low-priority tasks that do not impact business needs or sprint goals. These task's progress are to stop so that the bouncer may honor their role.  I am looking for more a much more formal definition of this role, and any information about it that I can get my hands on. Is there such information? Does this role go by other names that yield better search results? "
1805,How do you agree with a client for a deliverable version (definition of done) on a big project,"My company sells an ERP software in a very specific niche.   The process is turnkey and every bit of data is entered for the client before launch. Since a lot of our customers have different needs, we assess as much as possible what features they will need in the system and code it for them before delivery. Although we know the client will never get a full grasp of the whole system and all it's details before a few years of usage, we want to agree on a final deliverable solution and leave the rest to basic annual customer service / support or custom development that can be purchased separately.  This seemed like an impossible task for us at the time see the kind of feedback we had below :      I did not know the sales report would look like this, it doesn't look like my old paper report. We want you to change X, Y and Z without paying extra development costs.   or even     I know we've had the system for a few months now but I just got around to using X tool and I would like it to be able to track Y also, I thought it would already track it.   These demands can go on for months and even years after the initial delivery. We are very close to the client during the development process and we try to flex everything around his needs but we need to find a way to draw a line somewhere and stop it. The customer has the system in hand during the development process to look at it but we feel he doesn't even bother to look at it before delivery.    Fast forward a few years, we decided to document the whole system step by step for every deliveries as it will be delivered to a client. So we take a look at the client, we record a dummy job go through the process, we write a fully detailed guide of all the steps and screenshot every possible pages of the application for the customer to signoff on. Once he signs, we deliver it exactly like explained in this detailled report.  This is extermely time consuming. But if it did fix the initial problem, it wouldn't bother us much.  It still won't work very well as the client doesn't even take the time to consult that whole documentation (who does?) and he still comes back with tons of adjustments we could have made earlier.   I know this question is very hard to answer and that thousands of software companies dealing in custom probably have the same questions but I was wondering if anyone had some insight on what we could try next.    How do you agree with a customer on the version that will be delivered to him/her if he doesn't take the time to look at it? How do you get the client comfortable enough in your system that he is able to clearly agree on a deliverable version that suits his needs.  How do you agree with a deliverable product with the client without explaining step by step and screenshot by screenshot what the whole thing will look like.    I feel like my customer is buying a house but will only take a look at the blueprints / pictures and everything else once the house is completely built then bother the contractors for a year after to tell them the garage shouldn't be there and that there is a missing bedroom.

1806,How to manage client feedback during wireframe phase,"My team and I offer freelance web development services, often to non-technology personal.  We started to incorporate a wireframe phase in our web software development process (as opposed to outsourcing it).  Often times, clients would review our wireframes and request features to be added that meet any or all of the following conditions:   features are in conflict with specifications with other features features will result in poor user experience features are half-baked ideas that I know will not work if explored further   I believe I can prove each of my points above if we devoted substantial time to exploring them. However, our clients are on a tight budget, and I can't justify spending over 50% of their budget explaining to them why their ideas are bad.  They would rather we spend that budget on actual development.  Options I'm considering:   Find a way to reduce client involvement in the wireframe phase.  However, how does my team know if the product design has satisfied business objectives? Do whatever the client says.  However, from my experience, 3-4 months from now, clients will complain how ""such and such"" is not user friendly, and throw a tantrum until we volunteer our time to upgrade their product. Something else?   We're currently using wireframe tools for the wireframing phase. So the actual drawing is fast. But the talking, and trying to explain everything to the client is taking too long.  Any management techniques you guys can suggest would be greatly appreciated. "
1807,Have I become paranoid about project & time management?,"How do you manage your projects (and your personal life) ? I tend to become psychotic because nothing seems to work. To specify the requirements &amp; information better (as a developer's way of thinking...):   There are several client projects, that can be :   Web site development  Web site design Graphics a mixture of them   There are several personal projects that can be the same as client ones plus:   Cleaning junk from the house  organise my music library fix my bike etc.  All projects will have:   Documents like :   accounts information (web services like ftp, ssh etc.)  invoices client information (history of purchases, personal information etc.)  Project files  Exports, drafts, etc.   I am using a MAC and an iPhone (and a lot of web !) I desperately NEED to have:   Projects and tasks organised An estimate that every project &amp; task needs and can change through time until completion    The problem is that there is an overload of tasks, work and information and reduces my productivity and motivation to complete goals. At the time of speaking I manage 4 personal projects, 3 personal professional projects and several corporate projects. I simply can't find a way to deal with all this stuff in a place.  Even though I am trying very hard, it seems that I need some guidance from experts. I am not very strict with dates (I definitely do not want to manage projects by time but as an estimate) and I have read a lot of GTD and pm methodologies as Scrum. At the end there is so much to organise that I feel devastated and stressed. Finally it ends where I do nothing and feel depressed.    The question that will change my way of thinking is: Am I started to become paranoid about organisation, or am I lacking somewhere that I can't see ? "
1808,Aligning story points' value,"We've ended up with non-linear weighing of our points. I worry this makes reporting velocity data erroneous. Background:   A fairly traditional deck is used: ?, 0, ½, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 20, 40, 100, and ∞ Only the low end of the scale is ever used for story estimates, we rarely go over 5 points and only had one thirteen-pointer. The point value is inconsistent across stories of different size. That is, one-pointers use ""lighter"" points and eight-pointers use ""heavier"" points:   1p: add tooltip text to a couple of icons; format date&amp;time strings 3p: create new user role and specify their permissions; automatically create a new case in CRM whenever certain actions are performed 5p: watchlist functionality; filtering functionality on several facets 8p: integrate with a third party provider and introduce a persistence layer to cache their responses    In a textbook scrum 1x 8p and 8x 1p should require same effort, in fact this is exactly what I'm trying to achieve! However in our estimate examples provided, ""integrating with a third party"" is a lot more difficult than ""adding a tooltip... 8 times"". So in our sprint planning 1x 8p ≠ 8x 1p.  How can our team break the ""anchoring"" to this estimating practice? What's the best way to flag up and approach this concern? "
1809,Story acceptance vs. ability to have potentially deliverable SW ready at sprint end,"for some time now the team, product owner and me (SM) have been busy with one task: the story acceptance and the ability to get potentially deliverable SW at the end of a sprint.  What sounds simple is - at least for us - not really easy. In the review, the Scrum process goes through the stories and accepts them or doesn't accept them. At this point the sprint activities are finished and the next sprint already greets.  So where is the problem? 2 teams (15 developers) are working on stories to bring about changes to a variety of SW modules. Continous integration is used, nightly full automated tests support quality assurance. Every team member has to merge his results at the sprint end to the development branch.  Each merge is critical, as each developer makes changes to several modules for a story, which at best are coordinated with his colleagues. The independence of stories, which may be given in terms of content, is no longer given on a code basis by the access to common modules.  If a story is not accepted, the changes must be rolled back, usually with collateral damage to other accepted stories. Also tests have to be run again to be able to say with a clear conscience that this SW is quality assured and deliverable.  What is the consequence? We have now reserved the last two days of the sprint for clean-up work: Day 1 is for merge activities and day 2 is for checking the nightly test results with fixes if necessary.  In the team this leads to displeasure (2 days missing), the product owner wonders if this can be done better - after all, Scrum is a success everywhere (?). Anyone who has read this far will wonder how a review works now. In fact, the review at the sprint end is more of a demo, the acceptance has already taken place for logistic reasons (2 days before). An acceptance doesn't take place in the review anymore.  I'm interested in how other Scrum teams deal with this everyday problem:   a) Will the review be moved forward ?  List item b) Are there approaches that    defuse the problem? c) ...other experiences?  "
1810,Is there any alternative to MS-Project server to build a collaborative deployment plan?,"Objective Questions:   How do you guys coordinate cross-team deployment plans? Are you still using the old school Excel for these plans? How do you rearrange tasks in a way the dependencies between them aren't broken and times are recalculated? Remember that using a MS Project file for deployment plan isn't a possibility as there are some teams that don't have access to a MS-Project instance.   Some background:  In my last project, during the deployment stage, we had to coordinate 6 'parallel' deployments (there are 2 different business lines + 3 different business regions). Each deployment was formed of around 10 high-level task descriptions, without too much details, in order to be a high level project deployment plan to be used across all teams involved.  As we were dealing with 10+ different teams across the globe, the time differences were a pain to manage. I build up a rough Excel sheet with some semi-automated formulas to automatically calculate the time dependencies based on the task + time taken for each task. Therefore, when changing the time taken for one task, all dependencies where automatically calculated.  Turns out that for the people who's not familiarized with Excel (or don't have time to check for the formulas), it wasn't easy to rearrange tasks. MS-Project was out of question because, as already stated, some teams don't have access to MS-Project instances.  Besides, during deployment, all involved parts were advised to update that sheet and share with all attendants.  From this experience, I believe that would be great if there was a way to:   Present deployment actions, (maybe in a format similiar to a Gantt chart, but in hours?) where managers could easily rearrange tasks, keeping their dependencies and having their times recalculated During deployment phase, all teams could collaboratively check when a task was done. During deployment phase, accountables for each task could mark tasks as completed.   Some possibilities:   Keep using the ol' buddy Excel Use a MS project (not sure if it would work), but having only the PM updating it Update somehow the outputs from MS Project into a SharePoint  "
1811,What's the difference between quality assurance and quality control?,"I'm having a hard time concisely explaining to some people what the difference between the two are. Also, I not totally sure what the scope and detail of quality assurance entails.  Quality control is the process of finding defects in a product. Quality assurance architecting processes to prevent defects.   Are these correct statements?  If they're false, could someone please elucidate a clear and effective way of explaining the differences? "
1812,How to merge multiple Enterprise Resources into one Enterprise Resource in Project Server?,"In Project Server (2013 if I need to be more specific), assume you have the following Enterprise Resources:   Res. A  Res. B   And you would like to replace them to be a single Enterprise Resource:    Res. C   What's the best approach to do this?  And how would you replace all task assignments of A and B by C?  If you rename A in C that's taken care of for res. A.   You then only have the assignments of Res. B that still need to be reassigned to Res. C. In MS Project you could then try to replace Res. B by Res. C in each project that has assignments for Res. B.  But since Res. A is already renamed to Res. C, Res. C is already added to the Project Resources pool and hence cannot be selected as a replacement for Res. B.  Any thoughts? "
1813,How do you motivate people to work overtime to meet a deadline?,"I have a deadline one week away, and we have set up pretty extensive expectations with the client.  Should I talk to the client to try to manage the expectation?  If they work overtime, do I have to stay with them, or will that anger them more?  This is the first time in our project where I'm pushing for overtime.  I do feel like I can do a better job managing expectations next cycle. "
1814,How to improve and facilitate prioritization of bug fixes?,"In a long-term software project with frequent releases, end-users regularly report bugs and defects in the product. When the reported bug is highly critical, the fix is generally developed and released right away. Otherwise the bug is recorded into a bug-tracking system, which is basically a list. One of the tasks of the product owner is to prioritize this list and decide what fixes to include in the next release.  The difficulty of prioritizing defects will increase along with the number of reported defects. Specifically, it is difficult to:   Estimate implications of each bug (including risk, technical complexity, etc.) See the whole picture : How stable is the product? Did the quality drop with the last release? etc. Identify duplicate bugs   What process or tool can the product owner (and the team) implement to facilitate (and potentially improve) prioritization of bug fixes? What are the advantages/disadvantages of these processes or tools? "
1815,Custom Column Calculation,"We use MS Project for work. I want to create a column that multiplies the cost of 'work' resources by 5% and 'cost' resources by 15% for each task line.   In Excel I know I could use an 'ifs' statement  (If it is 'work' than x 1.05, if it is 'cost' then x 1.15, if it is neither then do nothing)  = ifs(A2=""work"", B2*1.05,A2=""cost"", B2*1.15,"""")  I cannot figure out what I need to do in MS project.  How do I create a calculation based on the type of resource - Do I need to make multiple columns and then sum them? or can I create a statement formula?  this is the formula I am trying, but of course I am getting errors IIf([Resource Type]=""Work"",[Cost]*1.05,IIf([Resource Type]=""Cost"",[Cost]*1.15))  thanks "
1816,How Microsoft Project Server can support Online Project Management and Planning with different user credentials,"I am representing a construction developer firm and I am looking for a tool to easily manage my contractors' progress and their payment. Currently I am using Microsoft Project and Microsoft Excel to keep track of all the work progress, claims and whatnot. It is a very tedious progress for me.   Note that I am not talking about software project management tools.   I am looking at the Microsoft Project Server. I am interested to configure it so that it should have the following standard project management features and functionality:   Our construction developer firm will be the ""superuser"" who can see all the progress of all projects, made by our users--consists of contractors and sub-con (""normal users""). Our users can only see the projects that are related to them, they can't see other users' progress, of course. Only the superuser gets to see the whole project progress, in the form of Gantt chart, project baselines and whatnot.  Progress indication and % of completion and all the things that a real project management has, like start date, due date and so on. The progress indication can be updated by the ""normal users"". Cost and projection. The user can specify the actual cost spent,the progress, and the estimated remaining cost for a task. At the end of the day, the program will take all these information, compute a new budget and compare this against the initial budget to check whether the project is over-budget or not.  It should be easy for our users to attach photo, provide description in conjunction with their progress of completion.   My question is, can Microsoft Project Server be extended or configured or customized to support the above needs? Or is there any other tools ( open source or not) that can be supported to do this? "
1817,How can I find the best distribution of a set of tasks,"I have a project that has many tasks, some of them needs others as requirements, others don't. All tasks have a duration that will not change. We have 5 ""workers"" that can work at only one task at a time.  Is it possible to find the best possible way to assign tasks to reduce total time?  I've tried OmniPlan but I'm not really a project manager and don't know how the software works.  I've managed to assign some tasks to a worker and ""level"" them to see one before the other. But I have to manually assign a task to a worker and I have a lot of tasks.  Is there any software that can calculate that?  Example:  Task 1 - 1d Task 2 - 3d Task 3 - 3d Task 4 - 7d Task 5 - 9d Task 6 - 2d Task 7 - 5d Task 8 - 3d   Possible Distribution:  Worker 1: Task 5 Worker 2: Task 4, 6 Worker 3: Task 2, 3 Worker 4: Task 1, 7 Worker 5: Task 8  "
1818,How to manage delays from external clients,"There are many variables to measure when dealing with clients, but to me these are the most important variables that I dealt with:   Clients that are internal or external: If internal, it should depend from the organization structure, power, influence and authority. Clients that are being manage remotely Clients that are from other cultures (time and motivation): Those countries where time management is polychronic and not monochronic Perception of displacement of people when automation arrives: Mainly reluctance to change   Many of these cases were included in my risk management plan. I set up many strategies to reduce negative risks. However I found many troubles when dealing with ""external, polychronic, reluctant-to-change"" clients.  I tend to talk to them before to adjust my schedule, send status reports to my close involved stakeholders. In some cases where things didn't work out, I requested to appoint a project coordinator from client's side. Things go well, but at some point that person has no control over end-users. Tests, feedback, answers to documents get late.  In order to have a balance upon this situation, I have some contingency reserve.  Sometimes I escalate these issues to a higher authority what makes things work ""faster"", but not better, because it creates a toxic environment. My team and I are performing mostly on time, but client cannot follow our rhythm. There are many excuses on every weekly remote web conference.  It is ridiculous how many months it takes the client to test some things. They think that we have all time of the world. In some cases, my boss tells me not increase the cost or produce a change order, because it could be so aggressive. He says not to push them, but to keep communication and producing my weekly reports.  Why is this a problem? I keep getting new projects and having few projects like in stand-by, makes me forget things about processes and I need to review again all my planning and project documents (flowcharts, designs, issue logs, meeting records, etc.)  I realized that when a project is in-house and have the end-users, stakeholders and coordinator on the same office, and people were well communicated about the vision of the project, they tend to work on my track. This happens in some cultures where people need to be watched and tracked. Even in these cases, I can have a slight delay, but recoverable time that allow me to close the project.  How would you manage delays from external clients according to previous scenario? How to help engage better these kind of customers and how to accelerate the project? "
1819,Slow client answers,"Let's say, I have a project with well fixed deadlines, and a pretty good specification. Every specification needs additional discussion, with taking in consideration the client's requirements (I mean, this additional specifications won't be essential, but anyhow useful and necessary). But the client is too busy to answer to the mails, phone calls.  The project is ordered by the client, but its success depends on the development team, because it is made for an event with fixed date.   What is the best solution in this case?    Take decisions without the client's agreement: advantage: the project can be delivered in time; disadvantage: double development time, if the client wants other solution, or  Wait until the client answers: it can throw the finish time after the deadline, which isn't a good ""advertisement"" for the developer company?  "
1820,"What is the definition of ""development model""?","What is the definition of ""development model""?  For example: Waterfall model, Iterative model or Spiral model.  In this case ""model"" is just synonym of ""methodology"" (wikipedia keep articles about this models in ""methodologies"" section), or ""model"" is a model for methodology and metamodel for development process (i.e. set of principles on which build methodologies)?  If second case is more correct, are there some models, that not related with life circle of software? For example, can we name ""agile"" model and ""non-agile"" model? Or ""agile"" it is not a model, it is just family of methodologies? Looks like I'm confused again :-/ "
1821,How to handle last minute misleading requirement and/or dissatisfaction,"I have been discussing the question with a co-worker lately. We saw a project that was on track and almost ahead, and during the meetings the stakeholders were quiet and ""satisfied"" telling that everything was OK and they understood everything. However, after testing and ready to transfer the product to the end-users, a stakeholder told that something was not OK and wanted a fix for that.   The PM was performing this near to closing phase preparing his final report,  and shared this with some colleagues.  As he was ahead, someone told him to apply the change to avoid friction, and I said that he should request a change control process formally. According to PM, the feature was a nice to have, but stakeholder insisted.  We are always trying to be compliant with best practices, but there are some situations that make us think in an accurate solution.  I was reading last time that any change that impact the baselines should go for a review in the Change Control Board and even more if the PM and sponsor are not part of it. However, minor changes that could not affect the project should be within the PM's decision/authority.   Is this was a problem of communication or engagement or identifying well the stakeholder? As this PM is ahead of schedule, should he include the feature if there is no impact according to him and record the issue on the log? Should wait for approved change any ways? Or talk to the customer to close this project and incur in a contractual phase 2? This is risky as the stakeholder can be resilient to this decision and create a bad reputation for the product even if the product is fine.  "
1822,What to do when your manager keeps adding,This happens all the time. I have a project that has a deadline. Let's take an example we're the project is to be completed by the end of this month.  Yet my manager who has not gone to any of the meetings or enolved in the project likes to add to the project and expects it to be done while keeping the deadline. This has typically meant that I work on those items on my own time. How do I handle this? I'm working more than 40 hours a week and he know this yet it seems like it doesn't matter. Any suggestions? 
1823,Estimate hours of work for every user story,"In Scrum, is it mandatory to estimate the amount of hours needed to finish every user story before putting it in the Sprint? Or should we use planning poker and use points instead of hours? "
1824,Extent of Project Manager's responsibility,"To what extent can a Project Manager be held responsible for projects remaining on schedule and on budget?  Would it make sense for Project Managers to be either promoted (or otherwise rewarded) for a project that came in early, or demoted or punished (or fired?) for projects that are late or run over budget?  I'm not referring to Projects Managers who goofed off and ignored their project. I'm also not referring  to cases where an entire team is rewarded or punished.  How common is it for only the Project Manager to be highlighted for the success/failure of the team? "
1825,Managing a Product Owner in a not-yet-agile organization,"When my company was acquired, my 20-person development team gained a Product Owner who is energetic, engaged, and extremely idealistic. While many of the programmers on our team are familiar with agile principles, our methodology has been eclectic rather than agile, and we have delivered high-quality products on time for almost 10 years. Our programmers work on more than one project simultaneously, and all projects are not in this PO's area of responsibility.    We've ""gone agile"" in that we work in 2-week sprints from a backlog of prioritized user stories (not broken into 2-week size). The PO wants to know how many hours programmer X has available during each sprint and exactly what he will do with them.  He wants demonstrations of features completed at the end of each sprint, and if an implementation is more complicated than we expected and something isn't done, he considers that we have broken our commitment.  I've been reading about the Product Owner role in hopes of finding language to tell this person, ""Your role is to set the goals and priorities, not to manage our time at the level of hours. You need to focus on making sure the user stories are clear, and then leave us alone for a sprint to do our jobs unless we have questions.""  However, the more I read, the more I think maybe he's not overdoing the role per se; rather, the whole problem is that he's performing it too enthusiastically in an organization that isn't following his methodology and isn't convinced it will improve our output.   My specific question:  Is my statement above about the PO's role legitimate?  In a truly agile environment, does the PO go to the level of saying things like, ""OK, we have 40 person hours of work for Arthur and 32 person hours of work for Candace, and since they're each supposed to be half-time on this project, they should finish that work by the end of the next sprint."" ??   I know we have a lot of issues to resolve, but if you all tell me that this guy isn't over-stepping his role as a reasonable PO in an agile environment, our group might find a way to be less resentful. "
1826,How to chose the right perspective in user stories?,"As a PO I plan to write user stories for a project. In this project, we'll send messages via email that should get formatted according to a style guide, as an example. What is the best perspective to write the user stories in such cases?     I, as a receiver of an email notification want to find my new messages   all styled in a way making it identify them easily as sent by   ACME Corp.   or     I, as the brand manager of ACME Corp. want to see all messages sent by   email apply our corporate style guides?   Please note that this is just an example (don't waste your time on the email idea), I wonder which of the two perspectives is most useful for the development team that is going to implement my stories? "
1827,How other than financial constraints affect quality?,"I am doing research about the perception of quality. I have finished the philosophical part and moved to more practical questions and have some troubles understanding the following (quote from a book):     Quality is subject to constraints. However, cost may be wider than   simple financial cost: it refers to any critical resource such as   people, tools and time.   For the financial cost, it gives an example: more people buy cheaper cars than Rolls-Royce's because their assessment is constrained by cost.  My question is, how then the assessment can be constrained by the other constraints they mention? (time, tools, people)? "
1828,How can we adopt Kanban to our workflow?,"I'm working in a creative agency, with 8 people sharing the same physical space. Some of us travel often, and we are loosely organized in the following departments:    RnD, Design, Social, and  Management.   We mostly work on client projects, with the departments usually working in parallel. Our current workflow is - roughly - the following:    Requirements: Management talks to clients and gathers requirements Design: Our designers propose and finalize the UI Build Test  Go Live and Social    Also, we switch between projects very often.  We are looking for a better way to collaborate (individually and between departments), fix our workflow and store information (issues, tasks, ideas, etc) and are currently investigating Kanban, mostly because of its ability to adapt to current workflows.  How can we adapt Kanban to our workflow? Should we organize this workflow into columns or have it like labels on it's task? Social tasks and development tasks have a lot of differences. Should we put all of them in the same backlog? In what abstraction level?  Is there a more optimal solution for our workflow? "
1829,How to apply daily stand-up meetings with a large team on multiple projects,"Background  There are:   4 .Net Developers 4 PHP Developers 2 QA Specialists 2 Integration Specialists  2 Analysts 3 PMs 11 Projects in active development.  None are trivial. Some are programs with sub-projects.   I am the 4th PM tasked with adding method to the madness.  I am trying to take the org Agile.  My short term goal is to implement daily stand ups and Sprint planning (probably end up being more Kanban than Scrum).  The environment is multiple eCommerce and SaaS sites, so at any given time something can break and send all plans to the wind.  The Challenge:  We can't have 11 stand ups a day, nor can we perform work on 11 projects a day.   Option 1: Each PM has one stand up for the projects they want to focus on; however, some team members will be on all three and therefore need to attend 45 min worth of stand-ups every day. Option 2: We have one massive stand up with 17 people.  This would have the most transparency as to what project/task each person is/has been working on.  However; how long would such a meeting need to be?  How long would people end up listening to issues that do not apply to them? Option 3: I don't know, you tell me.  "
1830,"Should a Statement of Work (SOW) include ""coding style"" under the Client Obligations section?","I am hiring a contracting firm to rewrite a small application for my group.  The dev team is going to be a single person.  Based on past experiences with other developers, I'm concerned that the code produced is going to be functional, but inconsistently styled.  I'm negotiating the Statement of Work now.  Should I add something to ""Client Obligations"" about code style?  What about requiring use of ReSharper or something similar?  Is there sample boilerplate I can use?  I read the related question about a PM enforcing code style on devs; this question is different, in that I'm asking about adding specific language to the SoW. "
1831,How much defect rework is expected?,"I am working as developer in product based software company. In all companies I worked as of now , we say that the quality of this delivered story is good or bad. But I find this is subjective. Is there a standard rule of thumb where we can say for a work of X man hours , Y hours of rework in defect fixing is fine.   If Y value is within the range    a to b: Quality is very good   c to d: Quality is average   e to f: Quality is bad   Is there a standard rule like this ? May be it can not be standardized as  it depends on lot of other factors like complexity of work, skill of resource etc., but then what are the factors/metric I should consider to objectively say that quality is good or bad?   Is there any formula that takes into account these factors and tell about the quality. I agree that measurement may not be true but it will act as pointer or work to cement the subjective view ? "
1832,How does a scrum team measure its productivity against its productivity pre-scrum?,"In our company, we are moving some teams to scrum. Before scrum, it seems we don't have a lot of visibility into the productivity of the teams, and we don't necessarily have a way to measure the quality of the output the teams produce.  With the teams which have moved to scrum, senior management and the teams who have made the switch see the value. The development teams love the collective ownership and protection from disruptions, and the senior managers love being able to have a platform to have their feedback heard in the sprint review meetings. We have also had ""anecdotal evidence"" in the form of customers saying things like ""Wow! What happened to you all? Did you get funding or something?"" in response to the perceived faster development.  So, scrum feels faster. It feels nicer. But unfortunately many people still want to see hard data and don't like fuzzy warm feelings or evidence based on observation alone.    Is there any way to measure productivity against an old system where you previously had little to no data?  How does one approach convincing other teams in the organization that there are benefits to using agile methodologies like scrum when there's no hard data? "
1833,Is there any estimation method to estimate end user testing?,"Is there any estimation technique that can help us to estimate the number of needed test cases in traditional software projects? For example, we have a Software requirements specification (SRS) with 200 use cases; can I say ""we need 200 *10 = 2000 test cases"", as a rough estimation?  We need this estimation to write a test plan for the project manager. Sometimes we don't fully understand the application from the SRS because of having spent too little time performing test planning. "
1834,Avoid employees from stealing source code on a project,"I've been working for big and small companies, for the last 5 years. I've noticed that nobody, or at least on the places where I've worked for, is worried about the source code of the applications. For example I could at any time bring my usb key and get a copy of the whole system, some companies put it on a contract that you can't take the source code, but if you never make your copy public nobody will never note that you took that code.  So my question is, how could I organize a project/company in order to avoid developers to steal the source code?   Could that be a good option make everyone just work on one part of the software and then the have the manager to merge it and only risk that the manager will get a copy of it? For example will a software developer that work at Salesforce or at adobe has a full copy of the source on his pc?  Thanks :) "
1835,"What would a better industry standard title be than ""Team Captain"" and ""Team Leader""?","I recently took a position as a Team Captain. I report to my Team Leader who then reports out of department to an operations manager who manages multiple departments with hundreds of people. I handle almost all of the same tasks as he does without a few minor tasks. However, when he is ill or on vacation I assume the role entirely.   I find the term ""team captain"" a bit childish. From what I've been seeing online, the two words are used interchangeably. I feel his position should be ""manager"".    We decide everything together, and always consult each other, but I feel there is a large gap there between operations manager and team leader.  Team Captain reporting to a Team Leader I find confusing. If anything wouldn't the Team Captain be in charge? The Captain of the ship, while the Tr Lead (still being within the team and doing team duties, be the ""right hand man""?  I need to make suggestions because I would like to use that title but also don't want to take away from his title or coworkers thinking I am lying or trying to over step.   What are industry standard job titles that would fit the situation I have described? "
1836,How is incident management done in a large scale Scrum environment?,"How do large organizations, such as Amazon, Netflix or Spotify organize 24/7 support. These companies are known to have agile development models, which include ""You build it, you run it"". That means, there is no operations department which takes care of the application / feature once it is available to the end user. The team itself does maintenance and support. I know about all the advantages of this method, but I see some problems in terms of execution:    Agile teams are designed to be quite small, so there is just a limited number of people who can deal with an incident. These people are usually not available 24/7 as they are on vacation, sick or simply not reachable.  Theoretically, every developer needs access to production, meaning deployment, databases, filesystems etc. Are all these permissions just granted and it is only about trust? Who must be involved to do a fix, rollback etc.?   How is incident management done in a large scale Scrum environment?  "
1837,Who is responsible for risk management in Agile-style deliveries?,"I have a lot of experience of waterfall-style deliveries (or more accurately, incremental waterfall since I don't know of anyone who still does actual rigid waterfall any more), but none whatsoever in Agile-style deliveries.  I am considering how risk management is currently done in a well-run software delivery project and trying to figure out how it would be done in an Agile-style project.  I have read the Agile manifesto.  I have read this question and its answers  The barrier I keep coming up against is that the documentation and thinking around Agile-style deliveries focuses on the actual software build and delivery process, whereas more often that not the actual software build is just a part of an overall system/software delivery, which itself encompasses many moving parts to achieve a successful outcome.  So I would typically identify and actively manage risks that are largely external to the software build process. As examples, by no means exhaustive, I might consider the following:   How ready are the users for devoting time to UAT? Can I achieve UAT without impacting materially on users' day jobs? How can I handle the push back? What are the risks of not getting key technical resources (human or mechanical) by the time I need them? How can I mitigate that and/or provide contingencies? What are the risks that the outbound data feed/integration that we are developing will not be acceptable within the downstream systems? Are the other teams, that are responsible for the downstream systems, ready for a new data feed? Can it be incorporated into their release cycles? Will their test environments be ready and sufficiently capable? Etc.   In other words, as PM I consider many things that surround the software delivery that would not be handled within the actual software delivery team and it is as much a part of my responsibilities to manage these things to successful conclusion as it is to deliver successful software to the business.  So who does this kind of thinking in an Agile shop for a specific Agile-delivery project? Do they wrap an Agile software delivery with more classical project management resource in order to achieve these and other non-development goals of an overall project? "
1838,What to do with ill-defined stories?,"So, I am the Scrum master for my team, and my team's manager insists on putting stories in the sprint that are ill-defined.  For example, while they have a end goal in mind, it is a poorly defined story... we are not even sure of the systems involved or the level of effort required.  Mostly what the story contains is people to talk to to gather requirements.  Now, normally I'd relegate this story to the backlog and schedule some elaboration meetings, by my boss insists this story must be started this sprint.  When I tell him we can't commit to finishing something if we don't know what it is, he responds he doesn't care, it's got to be started this week.  The story isn't even for our project, it's someone else's systems and requirements.  He also makes it quite clear that we are judged based on stories that aren't finished by the end of the sprint.  How in the world can I deliver effectively on this?  I can't have my programmer do the business analysis work and create a story for next sprint... two weeks is too long.  Do I just say ""no"", remove the story from the sprint and let him fume, or break process on a fairly routine basis?  Is this indicative of a mindset/culture where Scrum just isn't going to work, and I should stop trying to do the square peg/round hole dance?  How can I effectively push back? "
1839,Can you use story points to measure growth?,"We recently started using story points in our agile process, which is awesome. Because of this we are getting estimates for certain tasks and getting an idea of our velocity.  However, I am curious whether story points can or should ever be used for measuring growth of the team?  So, for the classic example, let's say we have a group of developers who agree that an issue or project is worth 21 story points. For some of the developers it will take them 3 days while for the other developers it will take them 6 days.  At some point in time, while the complexity of issues remain the same, the productivity of the developers will naturally increase because of their familiarity with the codebase, etc. Is there an effective way of measuring growth in the team with story points? Or perhaps this is completely the wrong way of doing it. "
1840,How can we stop developers from working on stories that are not planned into the current sprint?,"ORIGINAL QUESTION  We carefully plan out a sprint and decide which stories should be worked on however some developers are working on stuff outside of this planned work.  This is undermining the whole process.   What techniques can we use to encourage/enforce developers to stick to the planned stories?  UPDATES:    Having talked to the developers we know they are working on the stories because they find them interesting or consider them important.  We have tried no techniques so far except asking/telling the developers not to.  Developers are working on both planned and 'personal' stories in parallel. The planned stories are sometimes completed but often not. The non-planned stories being worked on are legitimate pieces of work, just ones not prioritised into the current sprint.  The extra tasks being worked on are not refactoring. We consider refactoring to be part of a story, not a separate story in itself. [website]It is only a small number of developers in the team that are doing this, and they are a mixture of experienced and junior developers.  We have contractors on the team however it is the permanent staff that are going off-piste. The team has been working together for a few years although there are some new members of the team. We recently moved from Kanban to Scrum. We are in our 2nd Sprint. The developers in question have a history of going off-piste. I guess the original question might have been better worded: ""In the Scrum methodology, what techniques can we use...?"" The issue has been raised in the retrospective and the problem persists  "
1841,Should I disclose technical constraints and details to the client?,"Background  In our Software Requirements Specifications (SRS) we have a clause which states that the user should be able to make push notifications from the website to the mobile devices.  Should we inform the client about the constraints of the feature? For example:   Android limits push notifications to 1024 bytes iOS limits push notifications to 256 bytes   Should I inform the client that they will be limited to 128 characters in push messages, with translates to 1-2 sentences at best?  The General Question  Which is better:   Constantly email and request meetings from the client informing them about literally all the details and constraints which technology enforces on all different features? Keep a ""smart amount"" of information which is withheld as ""technological details?""   We are currently at the point where we are emailing the client at least once or twice a day, and sometimes even three of four. "
1842,What to do with epic technical stories?,"I have a lot of stories of the type: ""As a passenger, I want this plane to fly so that I can get to places"". The amount of work that the end user doesn't care about from this point on is enormous. Obviously the team will have to do a lot of work before the plane flies but the customer will just be waiting and getting nothing until the plane actually takes off. How would you break this into smaller stories that add value to the customer so you can deliver something at the end of each sprint? How is a non technical product owner going to be involved in writing stories or thinking of fit criteria? How would a sprint review look like?  Edit: clearly, my plane example wasn't the best. Let's try this one: ""As a customer (in an online shop) I want to be able to pay my cart using MasterCard so that I don't need to get a Visa"". This is a very concrete and precise feature but the technical work required may exceed the sprint length and add no value until it's actually done. "
1843,Is Defect density a valid technique at all?,"The formula involved for calculating defect density is simply (number of defects) / (lines of code). So if lines of code would be less it increases the chances of having a high defect density. In other words, if in a project design principles are strictly follwed and all duplicacy, all dead code, all redundancy is removed, it will only lead to lesser lines of code. Now this might be called an optimized piece of code. But that does not help with the defect density parameter.  If one is working on a project, where ultimately defect density is to be calculated, wouldn't it lead the programmers to ignore code duplicacy and dead code ?  Is Defect density a valid technique at all ? "
1844,Daily stand-up with multiple Scrum teams,"There are 3 Scrum teams (with ~15 people) whose work is tightly connected so it's necessary that teams to be up to date with the others' progress.  How is it possible to exchange info between teams on a daily basis in an effective manner?  A big stand-up with all of the members are too long. We've tried that each team delegates an ""ambassador"" who participate on the others' stand-up too but in that case the info flow was not the best.  Do you know a good way to keep updated connected Scrum team about each other? "
1845,Should a Product Owner be asking developers to do QA to meet deadlines?,"When the deadline is tight and when there are not enough QA people, the Product Owner asks developers to join in with QA to meet the deadline.    What should the developers do when this happens?   What's the right thing to do from a Scrum perspective?  "
1846,Do projects ever end early?,"When scheduling, I tend to add a lot of reality into the guestimates I am provided with.  I always add in generous amounts of probable sick days for manpower and extra time for integration and bug fixing. (All this based on decades of experience.)  As a result, my projects tend to deliver on schedule. But they never finish earlier than expected.  Now I'm wondering if the projects would deliver earlier if I didn't pad the schedule as much.   Would everything move a little faster if the teams had the incentive to meet deadlines based on the data they provided, as opposed to the padded ones I provide?  Or put another way: Does work expand to fill up available time? "
1847,Dealing with stories/functionality that will spread across the entire lifetime of the project,"I'm trying to determine how I would deal with a story/epic that appears to potentially spread across every sprint.     As a user I wish to have see help information against data inputs so   that I can see a description and get assistance for inputting the correct   data values.   * Now that story might not be perfect but I hope it illustrates the kind of story I'm talking about.  My query is how you might go about dealing with this in agile.  My thoughts were:   Implement this as an architectural story in that you do the framework for making this happen but each specific instance is incorporated into other stories that needs specific help. Identify all places where help will be required and make that tasks/sub stories.  However what if you don't know where these places will be exactly? This shouldn't be a story at all?  In this case, how would we handle it better. None of these points and something entirely different as the story is written poorly  "
1848,Does it make sense to reopen closed User Stories in a Scrum project,"I was asked to adjust our ticket-workflow and I don't know if it's a good route that we're taking here. So I'd like to ask for your opinions.  Our project is being developed based on a Scrum process with weekly sprints. As project management we use JIRA + Agile. We're around 10 people working on that project. However, around 50% are working from remote.  Our current workflow of issues is:   [Product Owner] Open  [Developer] In Development  [Developer] In Code Review [Tester] In Testing  [Product Owner] In Acceptance  [Product Owner] Done   Currently, if a ticket / user story is marked as done, the code changes get merged into the master branch. We also at the moment can't reopen a closed (Done) ticket. If there is a defect which - maybe directly - can be connected to a previously closed ticket, we create a new one. However, we had a discussion on adding the possibility to reopen a ticket.  From your point of view, does this fit within a Scrum-process? Does it make sense to reopen a closed / into master-branch integrated ticket? Should this only be applicable for tickets from the current Sprint or release? What are the advantages and disadvantages of such an approach? "
1849,What are the primary differences when promoted to a Programme Support role out of a Project Support role?,"Within a newly formed Programme Support Office, a number of new starts have been asked to evaluate their roles but they are all former Project Support Officers and some are straying into Project Support under the guise of helping the Project Manager in order to help the Programme Manager in the long run.  A number of other Project Managers have expressed the unfairness of ""free"" Project Support.    What are the primary differences in the roles of Project Support and Programme Support?  Which control documents should be in maintained by the Programme Support Officer?  What is the best use of their time?  Any and all advice appreciated in helping to craft the job description of the new role.  "
1850,PMO is a department/area or a role?,"Usually I read it about as a area or department, the Project Management Office. But, in my company, the newly created project management department is using the word to describe:   The schedule of activities (""hey, send me the PMO so I can follow the project, ok?"") The function of project manager (""you're the PMO of this project, isn't?"")   The word itself means only Project Management Office, right? "
1851,How do I elicit measurable business objectives in the real world?,"A very common theme in project management/software engineering resources is that goals should be SMART. This question is targeted to the ""M"" in SMART: Measurable.  The examples commonly found in literature or lectures often times seem unrealistic and far fetched to me. See for instance this example:     Analyst Question: How much would you like to reduce your chemical expenses?      Executive Response: By 25% within one year.      Wiegers, Karl; Beatty, Joy (2013-08-15). Software Requirements (3rd   Edition) (Developer Best Practices) (Kindle Locations 2180-2181).   Pearson Education. Kindle Edition.   So a business objective is to reduce chemical expenses by 25% within one year. That's a great measurable goal. But it sounds extremely unrealistic to hear such a thing from a customer. The customer does not want to reduce expenses by 25% in one year, he wants to eliminate the costs altogether and he wants to do so immediately.  This would sound somewhat more realistic to me:     Executive Response: Within 10 years the software must have saved us as much money as we invested to develop it. Because if it does not we would better have invested our money in another project.   How do real projects get to those numbers? "
1852,Better (financial) motivation for a developer: percentage or fixed salary?,"Until now, I worked on projects with fixed salary, receiving it at each period (monthly). But I would like to know, what if the workers should receive their salary with a percentage of the project's value? Would it be more motivating to finalize it as well as is possible?  I see now three payment possibility, as rewarding a project from financial approach:    fixed (periodic) salary percentage of the project's value the combination: a smaller amount, fixed salary plus a percentage.   Which is the better solution? "
1853,Dev went on vacation leaving his work unfinished. How to manage this without informing the customer?,"I would like to discuss and hear some advice from you about a pretty common situation.  We develop the functionality that has huge business value for the customer’s project and thus the customer is particularly interested that this feature is completed asap. I selected the most appropriate developer for this task based on my team’s current workload, experience with the project and vacation schedule in the team. The developer started researching the problem. The functionality is completely new, connected to the integration with third-party API and plugin and contains numerous technical and business unknowns. The developer made an initial rough estimate of the task and it showed that by the time of his vacation there might be an MVP of the feature. I communicated with him on a daily basis and the progress seemed satisfactory. I felt that by the time of his vacation the developer would finish the main bulk of the task and the other team member could assist with its testing during the absence of the key developer.   Before the vacation, I gathered both developers to define a set of actions that an interim developer should do during the vacation week. Planned functionality was not completed as expected and another developer could not test anything yet. Interim developer listened to an explanation of the feature, read the code and said that he was not able to continue development since the feature was so huge that it required at least a week to research everything. In addition, there were still several unanswered questions that might impede the development of the feature.   1)  What should be my actions in this situation now? I cannot tell the client that the development of the feature has stopped because the dev went on vacation. This would be unprofessional.   2)  What could I do earlier in order to avoid this situation? "
1854,"In an Agile environment, how should a developer update team members and managers when there's no ""visible"" progress?","A developer is working on a research project that involves working with new  technologies. The concepts are also new to the developer, and the developer is working on building a product on top of the new API's.  As a result of the technology being new and undocumented, the developer spends a lot of time tearing apart demos and analyzing data in order to understand the technology.  Since many agile methodologies involve daily or frequent team updates, such as Scrum and the daily stand up, how should developers give updates to both technical and non-technical stakeholders without it sounding like he or she accomplished nothing?  Note that the meeting we have currently doesn't have a name.  When the work involves a fair degree of learning or acquisition of knowledge, as a PM, how can I advise these developers give their updates without making them feel as if they aren't making any progress, since there may not be anything to show for days/weeks?  Should the frequency of status meetings be reduced, or should the frequency remain the same with a different approach?  "
1855,MS Project's BCWP line in EVM report looks wrong and I can't reproduce it,"I'm using MS Project 2013's Earned Value Report under the Report>Costs>Earned Value Report menu.  The line for BCWP (the earned value) is much shallower than what I get by plotting the cumulative BCWP values from the Tracking Gantt table in Excel.  What I see in Excel is much more like what I expect.  To create my Excel plot I toggle off the Summary tasks and copy the Start, Finish, and Earned Value - EV (BCWP) columns to a new excel worksheet.  I then sort them by Start and I add a 'Cumulative Earned Value' column that computes a cumulative earned value from the Earned Value - EV (BCWP) column.  I then create a line chart of the date vs the cumulative earned value and it's much higher than what I see in MS Project's report.  Does anyone know how MS Project generates their BCWP trace?  Is there any way to get access to the data they're plotting and how it's computed? "
1856,"How does Jira ""resolved"" field (or its alias name ""resolutionDate"") get set?","I am new to Jira and I have just joined a new team that is using Jira. We have a problem with our Jira Service Desk project's workflow. It looks like some months ago when an issue was moved to Resolved status, the Jira workflow successfully set a ""resolved"" field (which also has an alias name ""resolutionDate"") which is needed for reporting. However some months ago this field stopped updating, now it is no longer being set. It is suspected an ex-team member may have broken it while modifying the workflow. Can you guide me in how to fix this?  I can see from this fields reference page that resolution / resolutiondate is a standard field.   Is there anywhere I can find more documentation for the field? Or how Jira workflows set their standard fields? Should I be able to see the field being set in the out-of-the-box service desk workflow somewhere? i.e. where do I need to check? "
1857,What is the difference between ITIL and PMP?,"It seems I'm dragging you along with me in the IT field, believe me, it's not premeditated. My question - a little broad that I admit - is: when is ITIL used and when is the PMP used? and why rather the PMP and not the ITIL? and vice versa? "
1858,What does it mean to cultivate a team's Agile mindset?,"If team strictly follows Agile's core values and principles and they started living as per the Agile manifesto, does this mean the team’s mindset is now changed to Agile? Or does anything else need to be done? "
1859,Interview question for an Iteration Manager position,"I am having an interview for an Iteration Manager position and they have given me a scenario to prepare for which we will talk about during the interview. The scenario is as follows:  There is a piece of high priority regulatory work that gets assigned to your team. There is no Product Owner. The Business Analyst is split in 4 other projects to look after. Your team has estimated the stories and indicate it will take about 4 iterations. The Project Manager keeps questioning every estimate they have done, because he communicated to the Project Steering Group that it was only 1 iteration of work. More people get assigned to the team. There is high pressure from the Project Manager and Senior stakeholders to deliver on the estimated planned date.  How do you deal with this?  It definitely seems like a very Kobayashi Maru sort of situation where the only solution is a no-win solution.  Here are my thoughts:  Problems:  No PO   When there is no PO you lose customer focus. Without a PO you are losing the person who is helping the team understand what the customer truly requires in their product There is no feedback about the product that the team is developing Without a PO the team decides how the product is to be built. The PM can get involved but that allows the business to be unaccountable for developing the system. This responsibility is deferred to the team in this situation and this is not a good thing to have happen. Without a PO who is determining the requirements and assisting with the Product Backlog?    BA focus is split between 4 other projects   Find time with the BA to discuss the stories   PM doesn’t trust the estimations from the team   The PM is not the customer nor are they the person who can set the acceptance criteria The PM can see a demo but they cannot say for certain that the team is developing the correct requirements in the correct order / priority   PM communicated to the that the work will take 1 iteration. Team    estimated 4 iterations More people get assigned to the team   It is unreasonable to expect the teams output to increase 4x, however assigning more people to the team may not result in the work taking less time. Ramp up time to get new members up to speed would need the original team members to get the new members of the team on the same page regarding progress and code etc. (Brooks law: adding man power to a late software project makes it later).   Pressure from PM and Senior Stakeholders to deliver on the estimated planned date   Was there a miscommunication between the PM, Senior Stakeholders and the unknown PO?   Actions:   Explain to the PM and the Senior Stakeholders that by not having a PO for this product the end result may be the development of a product that doesn’t match with the customers / regulatory works requirements. Attempt to break down the estimated stories further. By doing this, the stories may be able to exist on a more granular level allowing the PM to better understand the reasonings behind the teams original estimates as well as seeing the amount of work / effort is required for each story to be completed. The team along with the PM could triage these smaller stories which would allow for better prioritisation in terms of the product backlog, however this could be hindered due to there being no PO and the BA being split amongst 4 different teams.   Regarding the PM   Maybe some misunderstanding in the requirements based of the regulatory work? I understand why he’s questioning the estimates from the team, but I would trust the teams estimates as I’m not sure where he got his estimates from. And is he now trying to cover himself from blame? There may be a miscommunication / misunderstanding between the PM and the product due to the lack of the PO   Are there any existing products that the team can use as an example for development?  Best course of action:   Make clear to the PM and the Senior Stakeholders that expecting the full product in one iteration will not be possible and that the team will try their best to hit the planned date with as many high-quality deliverables as they can. If theres been budget set aside for completion bonuses, it would be a good time to use it now as a motivator for the team. Stress that in future, any order for high priority work which needs to be delivered by a set date that there must be a PO for the work with a PM that communicates and trusts the estimates of the team and the IM. Depending on the regulations and the Senior Stakeholders / Project Steering group, it may not actually matter if it hits a specific date. If there was a PO this may have been clearer. Maybe the latest version isn’t compliant for the estimated 1 week iteration date mentioned by the PM but the product may not be launching until another date.   Apologies for the long read. Any thoughts would be appreciated! "
1860,Where does a project manager fit in a business unit's organization chart?,"Given that a unit has a Director and a Manager, whom does the Project Manager of that unit ordinarily report to, the Director or the Manager?  It seems that if the Project Manager reports to the Director this would create all kinds of issues since the PM has no tasking authority over employees who are supervised by the Manager. If the PM reports to the Manager though then the Director has no direct line to the PM to execute tasks the Director may need.  There is probably no right or wrong way to set this up, but how is it usually done? "
1861,How to explain to management that taking over an external project is a big risk?,"Management thinks that it would be lucrative to take over a fairly complex solution from a startup founder. Apparently the client has fired the tech company that had built it due to ""poor quality"". It is already live but he desperately needs to get a few more features up.  I have asked my lead developer to take a look at the codebase and there's quite a few large components:   User facing Android (Java) and iOS (Swift) app Merchant facing Android (Java) app  API Backend in Laravel (PHP) User facing website in PHP User and merchant facing admin interface in Laravel (PHP)   According to my lead developer, the code is pretty readable, modular and clean. He does not get what is the issue with the quality of the solution. The apps themselves visually look good and seem to follow standard UI guidelines. He thinks this could be a potential red flag with the client. How can I find out if this is the case?  Furthermore, management has tasked me to come up with a profitable maintenance contract with the client. My developer says that we'll probably need quite a substantial effort to get up to speed with the whole thing. It will be at least a few weeks to get familiarised with the codebase and the business logic before we can even start building new features. We are also not familiar with Laravel which will add to that effort. The client does not have any technical documentation either.  Given all of this, it is seems that it would be a huge risk to take on this project. However, management seems to think that it's easy money. The work is ""already done"", we just have to do ""a bit more"" for this client. A team consisting of an Android developer, an iOS developer and PHP developer is being put together to work on it because ""that's the technologies that the solution is built with"". How do I convince management it's not just about the technologies? If management decides to go ahead with this, how do I price this responsibly? "
1862,How is a countermeasure influencing the total risk score?,"I'm just setting up a risk management for a project, and I have to admit, that I'm not used to it. That's my table so far.   -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Identification         |Analysis            |Prevention           |Final Risk | --------------------------------------------------------------------         |ID|Name |Desc |Reasons |Possibility |Impact |CounterM |Monitoring |           |    --------------------------------------------------------------------------------   I will give scores for the Possibility of an occurrence and the Impact on occurrence. Placing the risk on a matrix, will show me the raw severity of the risk. I also will define Countermeasurments in case of an occurrence and Monitoring methods to avoid an occurrence. Both of them, especially Countermeasure will logically influence the Total Risk.  I think about a formula like     Is this reasonable? How would I calculate the Countermeasure value?  "
1863,Definition of Ready and Done in a Waterfall-Scrum Process (Global Definition as Solution?),"I am currently working on a project in which a so-called Waterfall-Scrum process is completed. This includes one week of development and one week of testing.   Each team (currently 7 teams building on each other!) currently has its own Definition of Ready and Definition of Done. This means that there are often strong problems in the process of testing and delivery to the next stage.   Problems that arise:   Partly late deliveries, from development to the next development stage Unclear definition of when, what, where to ship (even with different build times) Unclear circumstances which team tests when, where, what. It starts with the team that should use the Unit Test, only doing Functional Tests. However, other teams build on the only partially tested products. This results in a spiral of mistakes. Some teams have a staging process, others only partially. Pre-production is missing.   Approach (My suggestion)   Analysis of the process with all participants Use a new global definition of Ready and Done that clearly defines all teams when something needs to be done. Standardize the staging problem by introducing clear structures and unit testing. This allows you to intervene at an early stage in case of misconduct.   I've thought about some points, but I need your advice here:  The team's own definition of Ready and Done should remain in place. The global definition of Ready and Done should only describe the individual stages (delivery to the next test days).  Questions:   Am I right with my approach? Should a Global Definition of Ready and Done be able to solve problems within delivery and testing? Do you have other approaches? Should you only adapt the cross-team definition of Ready and Done?   Perhaps one or the other has already experienced something similar in another project?  "
1864,"Definition of a ""Quality Requirement"" is belwildering","The Project Management Body of Knowledge 5th Edition (PMBOK) states in the glossary     Quality Requirement- a condition or capability that will be used to   assess conformance by validating the acceptability of an attribute for   the quality of a result.   I understand the individual words, however when combined in this way I find myself lost. Can this be put simply? "
1865,Should a Scrum Team be comprised of Engineers from different code bases? Or is that irrelevant?,"We have a ""product suite"" that is comprised of 3 main products with separate code bases, 2 C projects, 1 Java.  The engineers have been placed on the same scrum team in the name of having a cross-functional team, since the three products make a complete product stack.  However, engineers cannot cross code bases. It would be too much, each code base has its own architecture and purpose.  This creates a situation where engineers cannot swarm or work as a team.  Also, most of the stories are product specific.. However.. occasionally there are stories that ""Unify"" the 3 product stack.  Should a Scrum Team be comprised of Engineers from different code bases? Pros / Cons? "
1866,How do you do Scrumban,"Current organisation wants to operate in a Kanban way but maintain the structure of sprints and burn down charts to keep track of progress. Is Scrumban the correct methodology? If so, what is the best way to implement it? "
1867,"How to articulate ROI for ""strategic"" project?","I want to initiate a project to enable communication within the organization. Although the cost is pretty clear, the benefits are obvious but not easily quantifiable. I am reticent to make unsubstantiated statements. Also there is no clear and present risk that this initiative aims at mitigating.  To some extent this question is related to a previous one. however this project is purely a strategic enabler which can after be leveraged by many other projects with much clearer ROI.  How can I quantify a Return On Investment for this initial initiative? Should I even try to justify it by a classic cost/benefit analysis? "
1868,Resources management and a cumbersome situation,"Given the following scenario (as I am new to this forum please excuse my noobish style to put the question).   A customer project (lead by project manager K) buys a full time person P as agreed with a service provider executive E. Inbetween is a coordinator C. P does not participate full time because C ""does not know about agreement with E"" and there are other tasks in other K-related projects to do for P (as previously agreed with K).   What is the correct escalation/mediation way? Is this maybe a prioritization problem on customer side (K)? "
1869,Why single backlog for cross-functional teams is important?,"I have 4 teams working on same product. Currently we use separate backlog for each one. When creating a story PO puts it into proper backlog in advance. His list of rough ideas (before they become stories in JIRA) and their priority is tracked in his separate system.   I'm regularly thinking about having a single backlog, as Scrum prescripts. But I see that in practice having single backlog can just create mess:   I like to have a rough stories allocated for 1-2 sprints ahead for each team. If we have single backlog it means that I will have 4 active sprints and 4-8 pending on a JIRA list view. Which is hard to manage I will have all bugs for all the teams in a single place, and will have to additionally put special tags on them to understand which team is responsible. Backlog will be huge! Backlog grooming may get messy, since a lot of people will be bored while grooming other team's items.   What do you think? Am I missing something? "
1870,What time tracking / time management software do you use?,"I made a few searches for such a question and I did not discover any.   So... have you tried implementing and actively using a software that is tracking employees time spent on different assignments? If so, could you please refer me to some useful ones? I also would appreciate very highly some brief reviews on your end. Why those helped and why are you satisfied using them.   I am a project manager in IT Company specifically producing websites, so I am trying to implement a time tracking software for lots of tasks over different projects. Other kind of requirement - it should be nice looking and with some smooth interface.   Thanks a lot for your input, guys.  "

1872,Who should bear the cost of upgrade? Client or Provider?,We are in the middle of developing iPhone app.   iOS 5 is recently released.   Now if we run the same codes in iOS 5 we get lot of errors / crashes. Should we charge the client to get the code upgraded to iOS 5? Because when we agreed on the contract there was no mention of upgrade to iOS 5. Or is it our responsibility to give code which is working fine? Although iOS 5 upgrade was not in our control.   We did not spend time in testing the code in iOS 5 beta because we thought it would be duplication of efforts if we have to test the code again after iOS 5 release.  Please let me know how you would handle this.  Thanks! 
1873,"Application Lifecycle Management Tools for a ""Buy"" Organization?","I'm working at an organization that is almost entirely a ""buy"" versus a ""build"" shop.  They prefer to implement off-the-shelf applications than build them from scratch, and have nothing in the way of lifecycle management tools.  As a result, things get implemented and never updated, then one day the pain of using outdated applications gets too much (e.g. the vendor sends a notice that the 15-year-old platform will no longer be supported) and they panic trying to find a new solution.  I've been searching for some sort of tooling to help this situation.  At the outset, it seemed sensible to search for ""Application Lifecycle Management Tools"", but that turned up a list of tools focused on development and getting a product out the door in revisions.  I tried a bunch of other terms (Configuration Management, Portfolio Management, etc.) and came up with nothing.  How do your organizations manage the lifecycles of implemented software?  Do you manage requirements for the implementation projects?  Do you use the tools to manage upgrades?  How about patches and version updates?  When do you know its time to go to a new application to serve the same business need? "
1874,Sprint backlog before going further with project,"I've an ongoing project with very tight deadline. I'm allowed to extend project deadline, if required. I've implemented Scrum (sprints).   Issue is - I've some backlog since one weeks, that I couldn't arrange to complete. I must complete project backlog, before I go further with project.  What should be better at this stage, from following options?   Extend current/next sprint and complete backlog with it. Do sprint allows the same? Create a new sprint and add between existing project flow. i.e. Upon completion of current sprint, should I add backlog sprint in between. Should I add new resources to team or ask my team for overtime? (I don't think it's better way.)   Any other proper solution for this situation? "
1875,Introducing scrum in a waterfall environment,"We have a wish to try to introduce Scrum in one of our development departments, but have a number of challenges we are not sure how to solve. If someone could point us in the right direction it would be very nice.  We are producing a very complex enterprise product and we have 2 product owners, 10 developers and 4 testers.  We have 4 releases each year which consist of 20-30 change requests ranging from 10 - 1500 hours each. We are bound by a fixed price contract which requires us to have a fixed deadline, scope and price on each of these changes. Besides the change requests we also do bugfixing. The release cycle is fixed and we have to deliver installable packages every 3 months + a number of service packs and hotfixes.  Some of our challenges we are facing are:   We have many small changes which only take a short time for one person to do. We have some specialized technologies that only a single person knows and can't easily be knowledge-transferred. We have a lot of urgent hotfixes that require immediate fixing. We have fixed budgets on each change and have strict rules on warning and raising budget as soon as we see it.   Questions:   How can we handle urgent hotfixes in the middle of a sprint? How do we handle the specialized technologies developers which often has tasks on a lot of different change requests - which would mean they need to be in multiple teams? Or small 1 man teams (which makes no sense)? How is the delivery manager integrated with the Scrum teams, so we can report progress, budget issues etc. with the client? Note that the product owners are not capable to do this job.  "
1876,Solution to scary programming/project management situation?,"I'm a newbie programmer in a troubling situation and wondered if anyone knew best practices for dealing with this type of project management problem.  After a rough job-search, I finally found a contract job to port an arcane system from an old OS to a new one.  I was up front about having little proficiency in the languages and systems involved, but by demonstrating sharp thinking, determination and analytical skills in the test interview I got the job.  A project manager even told me I was hired precisely because I had no preconceptions about the ""way things should be done"", and could adapt to their ""way of doing things"".  So, I went into the project excited, and was asked by the tech lead (the only person I directly report to and work with) to start looking through the manuals and original code for the system.  Well, I started looking... and it was vast.  The manual was voluminous, the system complex, and the code running for hundreds of thousands of lines.  I was immediately struck by the enormity of this task.  It was clearly a system designed and built by a large company over a period of years, modified many times since.  One year and only two people didn't seem nearly sufficient for the needs of the work ahead.  I asked the lead his thoughts on the original code, and surprisingly, he didn't seem to have looked at all, and didn't intend to.  I asked him how he knew this task could be done within a year without even knowing what the system already does.  He told me he had seen the system in operation once before, and it looked pretty basic and straightforward to him.  I know with certainty he's a highly intelligent, sharp, fast and skilled programmer, as I had the opportunity to look through and analyze code he had already written.  So I thought that his confidence was somewhat reassuring, and maybe he already had this whole project figured out.  So I decided to ask him what kind of design he was thinking about overall... and his answer was that we would just start coding different parts and kinda fit them together.  This immediately sent up red flags for me.  So first there wasn't any thorough analysis, and now there wasn't even a design.  How could we even know what parts to code, or that our parts would fit together?  How can we communicate progress to stakeholders without knowing what and how much work needs to be done?  I asked if there was a project schedule... and he said he had submitted one, but not to take it too seriously, he considered it a ""loose guideline"".  He showed it to me, and apparently we were already well behind on what he had communicated to management.  Okay, I thought, I was told I was hired because I had no preconceived notions, and wouldn't be a ""no, that can't be done this way"" kind of person.  I figured it was just a quirk of this new workplace I needed to adjust to.  Ironically, project management held a meeting a few days later, to discuss the scheduling of a big design review with major stakeholders.  The project schedule that was once a ""loose guideline"" was now suddenly a concrete baseline, and my tech lead was visibly shaken and tried to get a later date, and now management seems suspicious and concerned.  What should a person in my position do?  I had a difficult time finding work as it was, and if I do well in this job I might get future work, or at least good references if I move on.  So of course I don't want to get on the bad side of the tech lead who hired me, but I've tried talking with him and he only seems interested in coding now and worrying about everything else later.  Should I air my concerns with project management and risk getting my tech lead and only co-worker on this project into trouble?  Or do I just work even harder to make up for it?  Or should I trust my tech lead and not worry so much, and let the cards fall where they will?  I'm new to all this and facing many mixed messages, from outside and inside, and have no idea what to do.  I think there's a phrase for this environment: cowboy-coding.  Thanks for any help!  Edit:  I'll add more details here:   I've only been working at this company for little over a month so far, mostly reading through system manuals, analyzing code, learning as much as possible about the languages and tools we're using, etc., to get familiar with the project.  Right now I basically ask my tech lead what I should work on, he thinks about it, and then sends me off to do things.  For example, he might say ""get familiar with such'n'such versioning software"", or ""find a good library we can use for network communication"", etc.  "
1877,How do you reduce card size and limit scope creep in R&D tasks?,"Several of my team members do Research&amp;Development work, which by nature involves a lot of exploration and uncertainty, and requirements are not always clear since we don't know what is out there.  For those reasons our R&amp;D cards typically stay on the board for 2+ weeks, whereas our average cycle time from Priority to Done tends to be around 7 days. Those cards are also particularly vulnerable to scope creep.  How can we address this and make those cards flow faster? I have read Managing scope creep in Agile and How to minimize scope creep?, but I felt the answers to those questions didn't address contexts where uncertainty is much higher than in regular feature development. "
1878,How do you track and measure multitasked work and deliverables between different teams?,"Projects have different tasks. As PM, you need to measure how effective the team member with the task he/she is executing. What if the team member multitasks? How do you measure multitasking? I have no idea.  "
1879,Engineering costs vs. personal time costs and enterprise value offering strategy,"Since quite a long time I ask myself why is there a commonly reported problem  (by many peers) to get adequate up to date hardware and software tooling to accomplish IT projects in a competitive way (in fact, in direct analogy to industrial automation and machine workforce)?  Then I have found this amazing quote:     ""Unfortunately in many companies equipment and engineering time are   completely different costs according to the accounting structure, and   it often sadly makes financial sense to go cheap on the hardware even   with the huge extra expense of the engineering time. Boss may not have   control over it.""   My first hypothethis has been that in a consulting project you of course push revenue on actually selling time so optimization is not a managerial hot topic (but risk of mental damage to employed engineers). But then, same has been in fixed cost projects. Maybe, because also here a fixed amount of time has been sold and other type of internal cost just diminishes the projected revenue.  But, manual work produces unneeded amount of time..  Please help me understand this. Question: what is your solution to this to stay competiteve,drive good revenue and growth and not lose best of your engineers?   If you think I am wrong with this question in this community: are not savvy PMs who are actually able to recognize and communicate this waste of resources? "
1880,How to determine the story points to commit for the next sprint,"I'm a software QA that has limited knowledge of the agile methodology due to my sparse time with Agile teams in the past. Currently I'm exploring using Story points for my team instead of estimated hours.  One question I can't wrap my head around is, how do we estimate the no. of story points to commit for the next sprint? I've read that one way we can do that is by getting the average velocity. Is that right? And if it is, what is the frequency of calculating the average velocity?  Example:  Sprint duration:  2 weeks  Past sprints:  Sprint 1 = 40 completed story points  Sprint 2 = 50 completed story points  Sprint 3 = 70 completed story points   Let's assume Sprint 4 has a rough estimate of 53 story points to commit based on the average ((40+50+70)/3).   How do we then do the estimation for Sprint 5 and onwards? Surely if we keep on doing a calculation of averaging wouldn't the value converge? "
1881,Is it possible to track velocity on a waterfall project?,"Assuming similar work has been done in the past, can velocity be measured on a waterfall project? If that isn't the case, is there a more appropriate capacity management tool on a waterfall project? "
1882,How can I show scheduling for shared resources?,"We have people who work on half a dozen projects at a time (tech writers, testers, etc.).  What's the best way to do time planning for resources like this if you have six separate MS Project Plans for the various projects they are working on? I have heard MS Project Server solves this problem, but is it worth the grief?  "
1883,How to be a Scrum Master in old school corporations?,"The Scrum Master was created to confront traditional management processes which lead to waste; of time, of effort, of people’s lives. Designed originally as a servant leader, the Scrum Master was supposed to protect and support the framework of Scrum and inspire collaboration, creativity and engagement, and given the wondrous task of and infusing the organisation with values like courage, focus, commitment, respect and openness.  A role truly different to any traditional management role, aimed to challenge the individual and the organisation itself.   Over time, traditional corporate culture has undermined, crippled and even enslaved the Scrum Master role, force fitting it into the old management paradigm. Scrum Masters are now thought of as junior project managers or delivery managers responsible for little more than setting up meetings, collecting meaningless metrics and filing status reports.   So the question is ... How do you stand up to the pressures of old school hierarchical management organisations? Or should we just work for startups and small companies? "
1884,Is reporting project progress in % to supervisors acceptable?,"Currently I am working as a Project Manager in a big software project.  Currently my supervisors require me to report each week to report the project's progress in percentage form, as in the example:  75% (out of 100%), where 100% means the project is finished, delivered to the client and the client will pay the final sum for it.  My aim with this question is to gather data from experienced project managers if such practice is acceptable and reliable or not in Software Engineering?   Is it something which might actually help to get an insight on the project progress or it is a door which leads to anti-patterns and misconceptions? "
1885,Literature for introducing changes in software development process - not agile introduction,"I apologize for the lengthy question! The point is that I would like to ask book recommendations for my thesis where it is described how to introduce changes in an existing software development process. For details, please read the lengthy part.  I'm going to write my thesis (MBA) about how my team innovated our software development process by switching from TFVC to git and introducing more fine grained work tracking structure to be able to make more data driven decisions. It is subject of technology management science. What we did is process innovation. The main topic of my thesis is the process how to introduce new procedures, methods in an already existing process. For example: What are the steps you take? What are the parameters of your decision? How POCs can help? Where is the point of no return? Etc.  Due to that the university where I study more manufacturing focused than software development, the literature I got by my teaching material is also rather manufacturing focused. And also expected from the pupil (myself) that he/she should display that by his/her thesis he/she has an understanding about the available literature of the given science. What I have now is An implementation model for reducing resistance to technological change written by Mica R. Endsley and published in 1994. It is an excellent start, but as I said it is rather manufacturing focused and written before dot com crisis.  Despite the fact software development and software delivery took its methods (Could I say that its initial steps?) from manufacturing we don't have those restrictions (let's says, they are lightened in various extend) in software development as manufacturing has. For example, in SD you will have a failed build or dropped MVP having little cost, however the same dead end might cost significantly more in manufacturing. My point is, what is described by Endsley is a good start, but the change process in SD shall not be that rigid as it is described. As a consequence, I have to make a fine distinction between manufacturing processes and software development processes and shed on light that introducing change in software development process has similarities to that described by Endsley's and also it has differences too. In order to support the point above, I need literature from software development area about the suggested way of making changes in an already existing process. Beside that the thesis will have a conclusion where my experiences will be shown. Unfortunately, I can't recall any books about this topic because those I read are about introducing kanban, scrum and technology related stuff. Making changes in processes are driven by common sense in my world, but it is not enough in a thesis.  You might say PDCA cycle should be good. It is not applicable here because switching TFVC to git is rather a big bang thing than an iterative enhancement.  Many thanks for any help! "
1886,Is it normal to occasionally have two milestones with the same completion date?,"I'm developing a list of milestones for a hypothetical software development project.  Two of the milestones I've come up with are:     MILESTONE              DUE DATE    STAKEHOLDER   ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 3 Development completed  15/05/2012  Development   All development tasks have a                                       team          status of 'Done'. 4 System tested          15/05/2012  Testing team  Intranet system fulfills all                                                     of the test cases.   I've given both milestones the same completion date, as I can't see how one activity can be complete independently of the other.  If development is complete, then testing must be also, because testing might reveal errors which required further development to resolve.  If testing is complete, then development must be also, since the fact that the system is fulfilling all of the test cases means that the software is doing its job, hence no further development is required.  Does this seem normal? Or is there some mistake in the milestones I've defined?  (Parenthetically, do the milestones seem to break the SMART criteria in any way? Personally I think they are fine, unless I'm misinterpreting the SMART criteria somehow.) "
1887,Scrum 1.0 vs MSF Agile 5.0 Process templates in TFS 2010,"we're about to move from TFS server 2008 to TFS 2010 and I'm working on the details of the setup we want in 2010.  We are using Scrum and we need to decide what Process Template to use in our new TFS 2010 setup.  The choices seem to be between the Visual Studio Scrum 1.0 and MSF for Agile Software Development v5.0 process templates.   Does anyone know to what extent Microsoft is supporting these templates in future releases of TFS?  Can anyone recommend what they think is the best options for a Scrum project?  One complication is that we want to add original, remaining and complete hours fields for estimates and time tracking which the MSF Agile 5 template already has.  Also, that template seems to have some good reporting built in.    I've seen [website]In the Visual Studio 11 Developer Preview MSDN article on creating the backlog Product Backlog item is used in the screen shots (although the MSF Agile template is also mentioned) which makes me wonder if building on the Scrum 1.0 template is the direction Microsoft is going in?  I'm interested in what other people think and in feedback from others that have made the choice one way or the other.  Thanks, Pete "
1888,What type of PM work can be done remotely?,"I am interested in hearing experiences from others having experience in doing remote PM work. As it is very important for a PM role to have direct, face-to-face communication with the team members and the stakeholders. What kind of PM activities can be performed virtually? Can those activities be fun to do and value add for the project?  "
1889,"Is it useful to create a ""crisis"", and how should you guide a team?","I'm currently listening to David Snowden talking about complex adaptive systems (a team producing software counts).  In Agile software coaching and project management, I've heard that one of the useful ways to get a team to change is to have a sense of urgency to which the team needs to respond, or to create one. The theory is that this will allow the team to self-organise around the sense of urgency.  In real life, if there's a crisis, someone often takes control and is quite forceful about holding that control until the crisis has passed. This is also the recommendation which I believe David Snowden makes.  Is there a difference between the way a PM and team should act in a real crisis from a crisis generated in order to drive change? Is it useful to create or fake crises for the purposes of change, or should we be waiting until there's genuine need? In either event - what's the best way to help a team work within a crisis situation? "
1890,Structuring a WBS,"Should the structuring of tasks in a WBS be according to vertical ""features"" of a product or horizontal ""aspects"" of a product?  For example, say I'm developing warehouse software with 3 modules:   Orders Inventory Shipping   And suppose there are two stages of development:   Requirements Development Testing   Would it be appropriate to structure the WBS like this?...    PROJECT    Orders module      Requirements      Development      Testing    Inventory      Requirements      Development      Testing    etc...   Or this?...    PROJECT    Requirements      Orders module      Inventory module      Shipping module    Development      Orders module      Inventory module      Shipping module    Testing      etc...   Or does it not matter much?  Or should I be choosing one way or the other based on some particular aspect of the project, and if so, which aspect? "
1891,is determining the true needs of the customer is the responsibility of project manager?,"As all we know there is a significant difference between need and want. suppose our organization assigned you a project to develop a new product that will increase sale by 20%.  My question is is it your responsibility as a project manager to search for the end user or consumer of this product and search for it's need and build requirement based on that? I think: it's a lot of work to do, it's the responsibility of business analyst or marketing to search for these needs  Reason: I've a lot of other managerial work to do in the project and I cannot guarantee that this product will increase sales by 20%. it's out of my specialty!!  What about your opinion? "
1892,Software for task tracking,"I'm remotely managing a team of about 10 persons, and it becomes difficult to track every task and its status. I'm looking for a solution for task tracking. There are already a few of such applications which seem to respond to my needs:   todoyu smartq wrike hitask taskant   Does anyone have any experience using these products? Do you know alternative solutions (preferably not SaaS)? "
1893,"IT Project Management tool aimed at developers, but still generic enough for general purpose use?","I am a lead software developer, and I have just been tasked with revamping our software development process. Part of this will be to implement a system with the following:  Source Control Build automation Project management/ reporting Unit Testing Bug tracking Continuous integration  Now on the face of it, MS Team Foundation Server seems like the most obvious choice, especially as we are generally a MS software team, using Visual Studio and VSS.  However the snag is that solution would ideally be used by the whole IT department for Project Management/ reporting and Issue management, and as far as I know TFS is really aimed at software development.  So my question(s) is: Does such a set up exist? Is TFS flexible enough to facilitate more generic IT project ? Would it be better to implement Trac, SVN etc (because at Trac may well suit the IT department generally), and we could bolt on svn, Nunit, and other tools to meet the requirements list?  Thanks for reading - any ideas would be greatly appreciated. "
1894,Bug Reporting and Revenue Impacting Bugs,"I'm new to project management and trying to get a grasp on it. My latest challenge is bug reporting. I created a bug reporting form that contains standard questions:   Summary  Steps to Reproduce Expected Result vs Actual Result Screenshot Operating System Browser  Urgency   In the urgency field, I have a ranking of 1-4 with 1 being the lowest priority and 4 being the highest. I also included definitions of each ranking to assist users in selecting the correct ranking. A co-worker of mine, who is in charge of sales and on the frontlines, wants a new priority about bugs that impact revenue. All the bugs that he reports are in this category. While important, some of them are not as urgent as his knee-jerk response to the situation.   My boss also doesn't want revenue listed as a ranking factor in the priority situation due to the concern that we will end up back in the situation that we are currently in where everything is crisis-urgent and we need to move resources/engineering to this bug when in reality it's not as urgent to push other revenue-generating new features aside.   Has anyone been in this situation? Do you have advice on how to handle this situation? "
1895,Is it possible to reduce costs by crashing a project?,"I'm working on a study assignment, which involves creating a WBS and GANTT chart for a 6-month project.  Then I'm supposed expedite one of the tasks by increasing resources to it, thus decreasing the amount of time required to perform it.  So I add another resource to one of the tasks, and give both resources an even share of the time, so that the amount of time the task will take halved.  Now the assignment claims that I should able to reduce time and costs by doing this.  I can see how it reduces time, but how can it reduce cost, when I still have to pay the same amount of money for both resources per unit of work?  Broadly speaking, is it ever possible to reduce the overall cost of a project, purely by using crashing techniques? "
1896,Practising agile in deadline driven environments,"As a I understand, Agile is based on the team's velocity, which means that the project deadline is based on their velocity.  Problem 1  What do you do if you are a project manager, and the sales team have made a sale based on delivering the project on y date? Meaning that you have very little control of when a project should be due?  How do you practice agile methodologies properly so that the project is done in increments based on your teams velocity whilst respecting the deadline the sales team have made?   Problem 2  Agile unlike waterfall is based on not having a listing of requirements set at the start of the project, but rather discovering what is required on a sprint by sprint bases. I get that.  The problem is what if the client requests a project roadmap for launch so that they get a high level overview of roughly how the project is going to progress? How do you visually do this if you do not know what is required? "
1897,Should a Risk Management Plan include a Risk Register?,"Is it within the scope of a Risk Management Plan document to include a Risk Register?  Or should a Risk Register be created separately, and the plan merely state that a register will be created? "
1898,Can a Scrum Master be effective when working mostly remotely?,"I have been asked to interview for a Scrum Master position. The position is mostly remote, i.e. all people in the company generally work remotely and then meet up once every 2 weeks for Sprint Planning etc.  Is it realistically possible for a Scrum Master to be effective when working mostly remotely? What are the major differences in how he would approach the role, and how would he fill his days working totally remotely? "
1899,Project management and scheduling with shifting priorities and project juggling,"I'm new to any kind of formal PM and structure, but have been tasked with coming up with schedules task lists for a 'mom and pop' construction business that mainly operates by contract (small project, &lt; 30 days completion time). We are a small business with &lt; 30 employees.  My issue is that priorities and project focuses are either ambiguous, uncertain, or shift from day to day. Nailing down anything with management/ownership is very difficult; project and task juggling is the norm, and nothing is on a schedule until the day of (which may change by 10AM, who knows?). We also have a lot of ambiguity coming from a construction methodology standpoint, new technology, and vendor uncertainty. The norm is ""fly by the seat of your pants"" and ""this is what we are going to do until we're not"". Like it or not, this is what I am dealing with.  My question is this: how best can I handle trying to schedule out projects (using a Gantt chart, I guess?) or any kind of project or resource management (I've got the PMBOK and some other books) when management/ownership shifts tasks from day to day or morning to afternoon, new priorities or focuses arise overnight, and projects can be killed or put on hold instantly? I know my situation can't be unique.  (My second question is more pointed: does MS project have anything in place for such a situation, besides manually refiguring tasks?) "
1900,What does a quality management plan look like?,"I'm developing a quality management plan as part of a study assignment.  I guess I'm a bit lost on where to begin.  What general structure should a quality management document have? Or will it look different for each project?  Should this document list specific measures to be taken in order to increase quality (e.g. testing all software components, acceptance criteria on all user stories, incorporating customer feedback, etc)?  Should I be incorporating quality tools: SIPOC, CTQ, pilots, lessons learned, etc.?  How do I decide which tools should be used? Based on the particular quality needs of the project? "
1901,Is it possible to prescribe PM time spent on key activities during a working day?,"I will be transitioning from a developer role to a lead/project manager role soon, at a new job. I am not clear how Project Managers spend their day. I have asked this question to my friends and they said all the day goes in meetings and they are always busy. Do meetings really take a large amount of time for a PM?  Is it possible to define, in general terms, how PMs allocate their time, over a working day, to key activities such as Meetings with development, Admin and Stakeholder Management? Can these be expressed as percentages of the working day?  Do Project Managers typically find themselves with little to do in a standard working day?  "
1902,Anyone studying for PMP exam or have passed PMP?,"Is there anyone here who is studying for PMP exam or someone who has passed the exam already ?  I have two questions for those who have passed: Q1. Let's say I have read the book and understood the process but didn't memorize anything including Process Groups and Knowledge-Areas mainly Input, T&amp;T and Output process.   Will this help narrow down the situational questions and pass the exam ?  Q2. On the other extreme, I memorized all I/P, O/P and T&amp;T of all Knowledge-Areas. Will this make me a better person to answer situational questions ?  Any clues on how you passed will help.  Those who are studying for PMP exam, or those failed before and trying again:  Q. What is your strategy to pass this time around or pass on first attempt ? "
1903,in MSP 2010 How to change task duration units from weeks to days in bulk,"I'm dealing with a large plan developed by different people and it has some durations in days and some in weeks, but I'd like to unify them all in days. what is the best way to do this in MS Project 2010? I have tried to change from Options menus but it doesn't work, any clever suggestions? "
1904,Is there any pm methodology that works well on large projects?,"My team historically has averaged about 40 people over several years, often more than that. We have a pretty complex product that cuts across several problem domains. We switched from waterfall to scrum and looking back I have to say that neither worked (well). As one PM told me, our project was ""always yellow or red"" (meaning in state of high risk or seriously delayed).  Watefall ""worked"" bc once we were officially done with development and moved to testing, not many of officially done features actually worked and effective development has been done during (long) testing and tediously corrected. You could say that it was sort of official waterfall combined with underneath sort-of iterative process.  We switched to agile/scrum (in a very basic form). From frying pan into fire: we have terrible problems getting logically consistent product now. It's not strange given we have 5 major sub-teams (not all of them in one geo location) and Conway's law operates. Plus, repeated stress at the end of iteration over several years tends to wear out/exhaust people (that's my subjective feeling though, I do not have hard data to prove that). It's also has been terrible re keeping people long enough in one place/subsystem of the product so they could become experts and highly productive in their place: I get the impression that in this constant change we evolve towards being jacks of all trades and masters of nothing. In hindsight, I cannot tell that scrum has given us any definitive advantages (we have ""scrum of scrums"" of course and I can't detect that it has made any difference). Certainly, lack of big up-front design from my POV is a serious flaw: work gets unsynchronized, badly partitioned and needs to be redone or modified later.   It's like classic CS process deadlock, just moved to conceptual/design level: dev/subteam A waits for dev/subteam B to complete design X he/it relies so he could complete his/its design Y, while dev/subteam B waits for A to do his/their design Y so they/he could do X.  Scrum says nothing about infrastructure tasks apart from ""cram it into some user story"" (and so infrastructure suffers). Additional 3 smaller sub-topic teams (internal, external, content provider team using products of both previous ones) for particular area still can't even agree on common data representation and format. Tracking actual state of a zillion of tasks is a nightmare. The consensus in the team is that scrum has given us no benefits while imposing additional costs. Certainly it has not made us pay better attention to what customers/end users actually need.  I can't believe I'm saying this but for us waterfall worked (slightly) better than scrum (or to be more precise: it was ""not as bad, if only slightly less bad"").  Fortunately some subsystems are pretty much orthogonal, otherwise we'd get nothing done. This is pure random chance, though: a tad more internal dependencies between subsystems (re conceptual integrity, performance, etc) and we'd be toast. Being saved by dumb luck is no proof of effective organization or wisdom.  From my POV it's like this: if a project is small (grokkable by one person in entirety or close to it) or consists of a bunch of nearly independent concepts and features, any methodology will work. If a project is big (one person can't even grok an entire subsystem + there are lots of internal dependencies between subsystems in concepts, design, business logic and algorithms), no methodology works.  The only solution I personally see would be like this:   do the big, up-front analysis (collecting requirements) and big waterfall-style design (principles, assumptions, business logic). treat it as draft to be modified, initial starting point to be modified on the fly. develop this ""big design"" iteratively, using scrum or kanban. have analysts and designers constantly re-evaluate big picture - whether the product stays consistent, and sync design and code.   If that wouldn't work, I have to say that for me my project is like a ""Gordian knot from hell"" that is basically unsolvable (well) from my POV.  This super-long background info gets me to my question: are there any PM methodologies that work well on big projects?    Further details:   I understand that map is not the road. Sure. But I can't envision getting to Alaska from SA without the map. :-) As they say in math, methodology to me is a necessary, not a sufficient condition. Issues:    Deadlines: tight.  Budget: seriously underfunded.  Scope changes: constant.  Requirements: often changing, lots of gaps.  Team structure: revolving doors situation, people shifted around mindlessly.  Other issues: lots of (truly bad) legacy code, no appreciation of long-term situation and costs/benefits by mgmt.  Oh and: no (application) SW architect.  I know that people will shoot down my vision as ""asking for autopilot / panacea"", but I tend to think that A. Whitehall is onto smth when he said that progress is measured by a number of things we can do without thinking. A perfect methodology would fit any team: just have the guts to follow the procedure. If ""other factors"" - the unknown factors - are necessary to make project succeed, what are those?   I'm starting to think that this is all futile. I've done some rough, example calculations: Imagine: n features, m classes (assuming OO programming), k software characteristics (reliability, performance in various contexts, security, implementation cost, defect rates, time necessary to get development done, testing cost, testing time, etc), o people. Potential complexity: every feature can be divided into p classes (p less-than m, with sum of all p for all features == m), impacts at most k characteristics and can require work or intervention of any subset of o people.   So worst-case complexity (number of combinations) is n*m*k*o. with 20 features, 500 classes, 10 aspects and 40 people that is 4000000 (4 mil). Assuming generous release time of 18 months, that is 222222 (222 thousand) combinations per month. Suppose we cut 500 (or ""m"") classes into 50 manageable collections with each collection modifiable/refactorable internally without impacting another collection. That's still over 22 thousand combinations per month.  It is not humanly possible to track so many potential feature/class/person impacts on k (software characteristics) and select best combinations (plan ahead). Some sci-fi style hard-AI tool would have to do it. Otherwise, we're just throwing ""hail mary"": maybe it will work well enough in enough cases that the project will not get delayed. Or maybe it won't.  Background info to give you better idea of the system in question. This has to be sort of ""anonymized"" for reason of confidentiality.    Data flow  This one is fortunately pretty simple: agents &lt;-> server, with server consisting of following major subsystems:    agent comm   inventory  data aggregation  report generation   (there are of course many supporting subsystems, from server config console to web ui to REST api but I'm not including those here)    Implementation  Technologies: C, Java, SQL. Environments range from hundreds to tens of thousands of agents (the biggest environment: about 100K of agents).  Code size: Several thousand Java files organized in approx 500 packages. About 900 KLOC total so far (not counting the agent). So it's not that big, but it's complex in the sense of involving many problem domains.  Aggregation is the most complex and resource intensive part of the app. We're using plain SQL for performance, but even then aggregation can't finish in 24 hrs for large environments (right when the next round of aggregation should start, i.e. next day). Miscalculation can be sort of serious, since it can easily cost a customer dozens of $M. "
1905,"What does ""CHAOS"" stand for in the CHAOS Report?","The Standish Group produces the CHAOS Report, with industry research on Project Management and Business Analysis standards, but what does ""CHAOS"" stand for?

1906,Tracking requirements,"I am having a difficult time understanding how requirements are tracked through the project.   I have a list of requirements - do I link these to deliverables during planning?  Do i periodically review requirements, and if so, do i check off or document somewhere if and how it was fulfilled?  The requirements traceability matches a requirement to project objectives, but this seems more for alignment to goals than tracking progress.  Is there a particular document and process that provides for documenting the fulfillment of a requirement?  Thanks. "
1907,Which apps / accesories for efficient meeting notes taking with an iPad,"I'm evaluating the use of iPad for meeting minutes.  PS : I've read this question : How effective will be an iPad to take Meeting Minutes?  My question is here HOW to use an iPad effectively (which app, etc...) and not IF an iPad is a suitable tool to do this  Current tooling and process :   As presenter : I use my laptop to present the powerpoint, and I take notes on a notepad (pen&amp;paper). I then do retranscriptions of the minutes on MS OneNote and I send the minutes in a mail. I also publish the notes on MS Word 2007 format for storage on network drive / sharepoint to allow access to third parties. As an attendee : I use my laptop with MS OneNote directly, and follow the same publishing process as above.    Drawings : from time to time I need to draw, for which I exclusively use my notepad.  So far I rank this usage as follows :    ++Digital notes allow me to search my notes. I have to do a lot of business interviews, and this saves me a lot of time when trying to retrieve info in the mass of data I've gathered ++OneNote provide quite good organization ++Notepad offers good versatility for drawing --still relying on paper notes for meeting where I'm the presenter, so still wasting time to do retranscription   Future :  I'm wondering regarding the iPad, and I have the following questions :    I would need to sync notes to my laptop (over 3G or mail), so evernote seems to be a very good choice. Are there other ? Do you recommand a specific keyboard (I'm afraid manual notes will be unreadable, and I type faster than I write Is stylus worthwhile for drawing ? Which app do you recommend for drawings ?   Thanks ! "
1908,What is the best approach to handle a project with different sub projects?,"I am currently handling a project. In the implementation phase of the project, they have 2 business units. the first BU is responsible for the technical requirements, the second is for the admin like billing, etc. From my company's perpective, we only see them as one and we will bill them as one but it looks like they have a conflict. How can I help them streamline their process? What is the best suggestion here? "

1910,Small development team with big amount of tasks for different projects - how to?,"We are small team of 4 developers who manage 2 large websites + 4-5 small websites + we have a channel for customizations / development service (one time service).  With all websites on support we work by hourly rates. With customizations (we moved them into separate project) we make estimations and sell them by fixed price.  We have different tasks from small (like moving a button, changing color) to large (2-8 days' length, like developing a new extension with some complex logic).  On support we have very different loads from time to time. Some days we have only a few tasks, other days they can add 1-2 big tasks and 20-50 small and mid-size tasks as well.  Currently we create such task types:   Fast Task - very small tasks can be done without confirming from client, like &lt;= 1-2h Task - usual task > 1-2h Bug - We know how to represent it at least. Sometimes we know how to fix, but sometimes we can't estimate it (need to research, research taking for example 2h and after that 5min to fix it) Problem - something we even can't reproduce or we don't know how to deal with. Can't be estimated and planned. Epic - used to decompose big tasks if possible. Sometimes used just to group a lot of tasks by one responsible manager from client side, adding new tasks related to one big story. As an example, UI/UX improvements with AB testing for a long time.   We make estimation on all tasks where possible.  Also we always have some tasks that can't be closed for a long time even if they are completed from our side. Client developers have no time / didn't finish code on their side (CRM, prepared products etc.) - we need to wait on such tasks for a long time and all those tasks are open in the list to not forget about them; they can be in status ""Customer Testing"" for example, but still in the list.  At this moment we have about 200 opened tickets/issues.  Very often, the client is asking for something ASAP and most likely they would ask this at the same time as another client or ask for a for few tasks at the same time :)   Clients sometimes ask us when some future task would be finished.  Which software can we use to deal with this and how do we need configure it for the best way to handle all of this?  I mean, how we can plan and get real deadlines in such chaos?   Also need to say - currently we use JIRA and I tried to create short sprints like 1 week, put there work for 1 week and in that case I can plan for example for 2-3 weeks ahead. But this doesn't work for the following reasons:   Sometimes our estimation is very different from reality - we are working on this + we plan a sprint for just 4 days (1 day is for such mistakes and bugfixing)/ Some tasks are finished on our side, but not tested or not prepared by the client and by the end of the sprint we need to move this task to the next sprint over and over again. JIRA allows to plan a sprint only by Original Estimate, but such tasks as in point 1 already are almost done but not closed. If we close them and later in 3 weeks when the customer would test it we will create another tasks - then the total time by task would be separated and we can't see how long it took. If we close the task - it is not merged yet to master - we can lose it at all and need to waste time to find the task and branch for it (we use branch names by task) Some tasks can't even be estimated as I wrote before What if a task is already on production, but after 1-2 weeks we found a bug in it? Reopen would have Original Estimate, Subtasks can't be included to sprint.   I thought about EasyRedmine with their resource planning, but not sure if this can help to handle all of this.  So please, any ideas or links where to find how I can manage all of this and how to make this processes better? We are ready to change the whole process if needed. "
1911,Database build up estimation for time,"I was asked to estimate my time for building a database engine, which would be a session-aware engine, in order to persist in memory the objects of the db.  The thing is that I had a code, an engine depended on Spring &amp; Hibernate which didn't do this.  While people asked me how much time should I need, the thing is that I already had refactored and reprogrammed parts of the code and seems to me now it is working as expected. I said it took me 20 full time days. It seemed to them long. Was it? How can I know? How can I measure that? The tools, were Spring/Hibernate an already made code, some spaghetti code inside, in Java, for a distributed application. "
1912,How to create a champion advocating change in a loose organisation,"My company has a new governmental customer that is causing me a major headache.  That customer is a group of loosely based organisations existing within a regional hub. The regional hub has budget power and can implement things without the consent of the base, e.g. all of our users.  My company is implementing our software on that regional basis, top-down. We started meeting to define the implementation timeline. When going to these meetings, one of the things that jumps out at me is that not all the organisations have the same incentive to change.  Some of them are not interested in any changes, therefore not coming to the meetings.  What is worse, is that they do not have someone who can bridge the political gap, a champion who can represent all the organisations.  I can already feel the impending doom.  The questions are the following:   Does it sound possible for me to ask the organisations to name someone who can be our main contact and let them deal with the hassle of software change, therefore culture change, by themselves? If the answer is no, are there ways to influence the organisations to make them organise themselves?   To clarify, I work for the supplier that is implementing the system that will be used by all sub-organisations of a regional hub. There are 13 regions. We do not have a project board or a steering group. I'm the PM and also the customer care manager. "
1913,How is consensus and accountability achieved in large software development projects?,"I'm studying how distributed software is managed (Linux, Wikipedia etc) and am trying to figure out if there is any pattern for consensus and accountability.   Ideally I could visualize the inputs and outputs of the management of the solution.   I'm sure this exists, and is likely more involved than ""use Agile"" or perhaps it's not and I have more learning to do.   Question   Is there any documentation or approach that focuses on the higher level management of a distributed software project? If ""git"" (or any other tooling) provides this, is there a visual that describes the input and output flow of decision making, checks and balances, and trust?    Justification  I'm about to open source some security software and want to be ready to handle the feedback, and plan for another group or entity to take it over... essentially a succession plan.  Ideally this would involve some form of checks-and-balances, but what exactly needs to be checked or balanced?    ... Who can I delegate that to? ... how?  "
1914,"How do I improve the development process when the only 'spec' is a ""slogan"" from management","I am working in a new environment where a typical project consist of a “slogan” provided by management and a team of engineers who delivers a product that matches the slogan. The company doesn't have any R&amp;D process and the consequence is that the development becomes ad-hoc and mistakes are made. Examples of mistakes;  - The slogan is misinterpret – R&amp;D delivers the wrong product  - Development starts without requirement analysis – we might end up in    a dead end due to technical problems.  - Technical documentation is fragmented and inconsistent. As there is    no development process in place the documentation is also ad-hoc;    there is no requirement documentation except from the slogans and the    technical documentation is fragmented and in various formats.  It is a small business mentality in a company that just became a little too big.  The good thing is that one of the tasks assigned to me is to address these problems. We are currently less than 10 engineers (mechanics, electronics and software) but I would expect us to grow in the years to come so I would like to make a serious attempt to do something good. I have been thinking about this for quite some time and I would like to apply the following SDLC to on the organization;   Formal phases (startup, planning, development, Verification &amp; Release, Follow up). Reviews for phase transitions where each phase needs to have its deliveries in place Management signoff for phase transition and release approval Risk analysis and risk management Documentation plans where the documentation is part of a document structure Regular meetings with the members of the project team and the stake holders   How can I manage the pain of transition? Is it even wise to try to apply something so rigorous on an inexperienced organization? I don’t want to scare my coworkers or the management. So I don’t really know how to handle this.  I’m currently leaning at writing a SDLC that describes the process, educate the development team and that apply this process on one new project and then take from there.  MY BACKGROUND I have been working in a regulated multi-disciplinary engineering environment for almost 15 years and I'm used to strict project management. We were using a project management model which was based on 5 phases; (0)Startup, (1)Planning, (2)Development, (3)Verification &amp; Release, (4)Follow up where the permission to move to the next phase required that you had fulfilled the deliveries for the phase. My main profession is software engineering as a software Lead, but I have also had responsibilities as sub-project manager and Scrum-master. When we were using agile methodologies for the software team we used them in phase 2 and 3. "
1915,Leadership in new team,"A new working team was created few days ago in my company, I was usually natural leader on every team I worked on there. With no kind of differentiations in wages, just leadership.  In this new group, there is another like me, and it's very clear that he wants to be the leader as much as I do. So far, we didn't have any fight, but there were some tense moments between us.  How should I act? Is it healthy for the team having two people fighting for leadership? Should I let him be the leader?  Additional info that may be useful: In my company there are no team leaders, just a boss that mixes the teams. "
1916,Is development experience required to become a PM in the IT sector?,"This question has been stuck in my head for a long time.  To become a project manager in the IT sector, should one have development experience, or a strong focus on general project management skills? Which one is better and more suitable? Are there any relevant reasons for both? "
1917,Value Adding VS Non Value Adding - Technique to identify.,"  For this question how would I go about identifying the non value adding?  In my opinion non value adding would be activities with a wait and huge delay = 2,3,5,6,9 and 10  On a side note, would any of these be business value adding? Can someone please provide formal definitions for each and a process they would use to identify and sort processes.  Please justify and correct my responses.  "
1918,Who is responsible for the requirements specification?,"I work for a small company as a software engineer. Our company doesn't have a business analyst or a project manager. We are about to sell a custom CMS system to a very IT illiterate customer.   Who is responsible for creating the requirements specification? If it's a project manager or a business analyst, who should fill this role and how can we avoid any problems as a result? "
1919,How can we combine time sheet in project server with scrum?,"Our developers work with VSTS using a scrum methodology and also with project server. Developers are required to enter their work hours in Project Server by time-sheets. However, they are not happy to complete their time sheets.   How can we convince them that both are important? Or should we stop using time-sheets? We need the time-sheet data for data analysis that we have them with Cube in Project Server. "
1920,"Global project without a charter, manager nor dedicated resources","I am facing a strange situation in one manufacturing company and I need help to figuring out what to do. The company has a very low PM maturity level, especially when it comes to non-manufacturing activities.  Global management has recently declared a strategic goal to finally release an internal hardware/software development platform for use in multiple company's manufacturing sites and start training developers to use it. It is being developed on and off for a few years and they now want it completed in 6 months.  I am assigned as an architect of the platform - my responsibility is making and enforcing technical decisions because developers in multiple countries are unable to agree themselves.   There is no project charter: project is defined by marketing material mostly and developers are to decide what to do and how to do it themselves. That is why I have my role - they can't agree. This also indicates the maturity level of the team.  There is no project sponsor: technical department managers (line managers, basically) are expected to spare some resources for common benefit and a strategic goal. There is no project manager: ""because project managers are expensive and busy with manufacturing projects"". To some extent I try to do manager tasks to keep development going.  There are no dedicated resources: developers are allowed to work on the project on their spare time (i.e. when there is a gap between commercial projects). Even ""dedicated"" resources like me have other higher priority tasks, in particular those that bring direct revenue.   This is not the first iteration like this and managers are not quite happy about wasted resources and developers spending 1000s of hours without completing anything. Platform is already in use by skilled developers, but it is in alpha stage where user/developer has to fix issues when build applications on the platform.  Previous iterations were ""completed"" when either deadline came or resources were removed from the project to do something else. Product documentation was simply declared complete and released as is, completion reported to management.  I don't know how to approach this. I am not in a position to change situation myself, my expressed concerns are either politely ignored or ""we have heard that before"". I really wish this to succeed, but am lost in how to go towards success.  Failure will harm me and will not bring the expected value to he company. What options do I have? What else is there to consider?  This company has a long success history in manufacturing, is growing and doing great from financial perspective, but development projects are treated as above and usually (if succeed) succeed only due to dedication and heroism of developers. "
1921,My manager is a local copy of Dr. House,"How would you deal with your manager if he doesn’t see the company’s cultural problems and tries to convince you to behave passive-aggressive?  Let me explain the situation. I’m a software engineer, and we do peer code reviews in the team. Sometimes, I get nit-picking comments and refuse to make changes with constructive feedback. In reply, my colleagues insist on their nit-picks (they even admit that they are nit-picking) for very long time, about 5 hours. In the end, I become told that 5 minutes caused triggered frustration and 5 hours discussion. But, wait, I’m frustrated and have wasted an enormous amount of time as well. It even has happened with a team lead; he allowed himself to ignore my feedback and kept resisting to change anything for 5 hours. Should not he value his, my, and company’s time and stop such discussions?  I have talked to my manager about this situation. He mentioned that Personal Development would help me dramatically. And he advised to ignore nit-picks and keep working, saying it would help me to think positively. But I do tell reviewers explicitly why I’m not ignoring their comments and why I don’t want to take them into account. It prevents me from keeping unsaid thoughts inside and sets a barrier between me and nitpicking. I believe, nobody wants to have nit-picks.  It seems my manager does not want to see the whole picture. He does not want to find the root of problems and fix it. He sees me “complaining” and thinks that I should be fixed instead.  I believe he is afraid of the whole picture because he himself causes a part of toxic energy floating in our company’s culture. Allowing it to exist, everyone picks up these waves and takes out on each other.  How would you explain this to your manager? "
1922,MS Project: How to deal with a reopened task,"There have a task which we assume be completed for a while, but just now we figured out that task is incomplete. How should I deal with that reopened task ? Should I set a baseline and then clean the task progress and set the new start/finish dates ? "
1923,Small Projects: Asking the right questions,"I'm a data analyst. I get assigned small projects.  The projects usually take anywhere from 1 day to 2 weeks to complete.  An example would be: Create a system/query that will generate a list of roads that are suitable for next year's asphalt crack-seal program.    Unfortunately, I don't usually get good direction from management about projects.   I would like to come up with some standard questions to ask management (and stakeholders) that would encourage them to put the project into context and give me the direction I need to be successful.  The questions might resemble something like this:   What is our department's overall goal? * What problem are we trying to solve? What happens if we don’t solve it? Why do we need to solve it now?   (Also, how will we know if we succeeded? And as a follow up: is the product still in use?)  * The department's goal has already been defined, I just want to remind them of it and tie the project back to it.  Question:  Sure, I can use the questions that I've come up with above. But I feel like I shouldn't be making this stuff up. Are there industry-standard questions that I could use instead? "
1924,"Reverse Auction ""Kanban-like"" methodology for agile development","I am trying to get some feedback on a methodology I would like to try with my team. Two problem areas I want to try and adapt this process to addess are:   A mix of time-critical (contracted deliverable) features mixed with other features Measuring the relative value of effort by different team members and developing incentives   Currently we have been using a basic Scrum style process. I like the idea of Kanban but I think in a development environment the WIP and team organization should be a lot more flexible. So I have been thinking about what I'm tentatively calling Reverse Auction Kanban.  In the basic summary form the Product Owner would basically put forward items that they think are ready or needed to be developed as if they were a standalone project. Engineers and QA could then bid on the work. The lowest bidding engineer or engineering group would then get the work assigned to them and would then need to deliver the work. Part of the ongoing incentive is that MBO/bonuses could be given based on the total points of work delivered by an individual.  So some examples:   Say I need a new screen developed. Maybe a senior web developer thinks it is worth 100 points. But perhaps a but maybe a junior developer wants more experience with web development. So he can bid 80 points to get the work. Because we release monthly I do not really care if the senior developer could do the feature in two days compared to the junior guy's three. Same situation but now say the customer needs this page in 1 week. Now the Senior developer raises his price to 200 points and the junior doesn't think he can get the work done in time. But the junior developer talks to the senior developer to place a joint price of 150 (The senior would take care of some of the tricky things and let the junior fill in the rest)   Features that have a high value to the business could be given a higher starting bid price. So in the above examples perhaps the Product Owner looks at past point values for page development and sets the starting price at 200 points. But in the second example the page would start at 500 points.  The Product Owner and other managers would be the arbitrators of the delivered product and accept the work at which point the points bid would be credited to the engineers. Over the course of a project or year the managers can keep track of the total points spent by the individuals and then award bonuses or other incentives to people who have done the most points of work.  What are people's thought on this model and what are some of the challenges or benefits you could see with such a model? Where does QA fit into a model like this? Would they be involved with every item as a team member or perhaps as the acceptance committee?  Thanks for sharing your thoughts,  Jason "
1925,Are Product Descriptions in PRINCE2 actually reusable?,"From the Quality chapter in PRINCE2 manual:     The time needed to create good Product Descriptions will depend on factors such as how important, complex and unique the product is, how many stakeholders will review and approve the product, and whether the organization has a library of standard Product Descriptions for reuse.   Since the Products and their quality requirements and are more or less unique:   Have you ever managed to reuse a Product Description? If so, are there any downsides (copy+paste mistakes, lack of creativity)?  "
1926,How can I improve measurement of Sprint Goals that are based on soft skills or communication processes?,"Background  I am currently coaching a non-development team on Scrum practices. The team is focused on back-office, administrative processes. This makes the work somewhat of a pull-queue where Kanban would be a better fit if the actual completion of work-product were not externalities to the team; as it is, Scrum was chosen a the framework due to its focus on stand-ups and retrospectives, which the organization believes will improve intra-team communication and lead to incremental process improvement.  ""Fail Early"" and ""Improve Intra-Team Communications"" as Sprint Goals  Recently, the team identified ""fail early"" as the Sprint Goal for an iteration. The idea was that tasks that can't be completed on time may not have alternative solutions or work-arounds---the business model accepts the risk that some percentage of tasks will fail, regardless of process efficiencies---but that these impending failures needs to transparent and visible to the entire team.  The goal of making early failures visible ties directly into the corollary objective of improving intra-team communication. This goes somewhat beyond the task coordination and blocker-identification of a daily stand-up; it requires a bit of a paradigm shift in the way that the team communicates with one another on a routine basis.  To the extent that the goal and its corollary was chosen by the team as a Sprint Goal without a concrete metric to determine if the Sprint Goal was done or not-done, I take responsibility as the Scrum Master for allowing that to happen. I still believe that these were valid objectives for the iteration, but they lack concreteness and a ""definition of done."" In retrospect, neither of these things has a self-evident performance indicator that can be tracked with any precision.  How to Measure Semi-Subjective Process-Improvement Goals  ""Fail early"" is somewhat subjective, but I believe I could potentially measure that by calculating the elapsed time from work-item start to its announced failure, and then tracking the ""failure lead time"" (e.g. the time between when a task is declared ""failed"" and its original due date). Perhaps there is an even better metric that I haven't considered yet; I'm certainly open to suggestions in that regard.  ""Improve intra-team communications"" is squishier. Effective communication is a soft-skill. Anything I can think of measuring (e.g. email volume, status fields updated in the job queue, etc.) are at best proxy metrics, and not particularly accurate ones at that. So, other than polling people for how well they feel communication is going, I can't think of a practical way to measure this necessary (but perhaps poorly-framed) objective.  Given the stated Sprint Goals, and assuming a priori that the organization sees value in achieving those two goals:   How can I measure them in a concrete, meaningful way? How might I adapt these (or similar) soft-skill goals in the future to better identify valid, trackable metrics?  "
1927,"What 'economic drivers' should be part of our ""software business case""?","So we need to perform a feasibility study of one of our initiatives and need to present it to the 'higher ups' - It needs to incorporate numbers (estimates) both from the perspective of tangibles and intangibles. I'm pretty good with the intangibles but what I'd like to know is what to include in a typical software business case from an 'economics' perspective.  I know I'll show the ROI/IRR (Internal Rate of Return). But I want to know what dimensions of various 'economic' aspects should I also focus on? What are typically the dimensions on which one would base such a feasibility study?  I'm looking for a 'complete' example so to speak - I mean it could be with just headings of what to consider but I'm NOT looking for templates. We are going to be preparing it in Excel to help with the numeric calculations.  My question is then this: When making a business case what economic drivers should we consider? E.g., cash flow instances/streams are one but what else? (Drivers that directly impact the (predicted) bottom line would also be appreciated e.g., expect market share increase etc.)  I'm basically trying to understand what 'quantifiable' aspects to include in the business case...yes I'm also discussing this internally but wanted to the views of the community too :) "
1928,What should a project manager do to on-board remote team members efficiently?,"What can I do as a project manager to ensure new team members are quickly brought up to speed within the project team?  The team is multidisciplinary, having mobile software engineers, UI &amp; UX designers, front-end and back-end web developers, and testers. Team members are coming in fast; they need training to get used to our systems and processes, but they also need to feel they're in the team.  In managing a project the most important factor is to have people working on the project like it is their own. With dispersed teams that don't have a common workplace, and that may never meet, that purpose is hindered by communication issues, mistrust, cultural differences, you name it.  How should I approach this issue from a project management perspective? "
1929,Denying payments as a project deadline penalty,"I've just had a bad project experience. I was a subcontract programmer of a subcontract software house. I've been assigned as a single developer to build an application.  During the development process, I suffered a rather severe illness which greatly decrease my ability to complete the project. My team leaders knew this condition very well since they visited me several times.  Despite the above condition, my team leaders didn't come with any solutions such as providing assistant programmer nor replace me with another programmer. Instead they keep pushed me to finish the job. The job was completed; however it was a few months late behind the deadline.  Now that the job was done, I had difficulties in getting my fee. It appears that my leaders blame me for the late completion. Yet, they still use my application as it is now online.  My questions:   What are common penalties for exceeding project deadlines?  What are your opinion about my case? Do I still had a chance to claim my fee?  "
1930,Sprint vs milestone vs release,"I am new in agile and Scrum, and I got confused as to what the differences are between a Sprint, a Milestone and a Release.  I heard some say that the Sprint is a Milestone. Also in some software the terms Sprint and Milestone look the same. But is it really so?  Some others say that a Milestone is not a Sprint, but a Release. So for them Milestone and Release are the same.  In The Scrum Guide, there is no word regarding Milestone. Why? Why do we always hear the word milestone in the agile conversations? Is milestone just another term for release?   I am looking for a clarification between those terms, Sprint, Milestone and Release and one example. I would like to know the exact Scrum definitions behind those terms. "
1931,What a good Lessons Learned paper should include?,I'm preparing a Lessons Learned paper and I wonder what such paper should contain. I found this post: [website]Are there any other point I should include in a lessons learned paper?  Are there any other tips that can make the paper useful for other PMs? 
1932,How to deal with project managers who like to overload you with work?,I have a project manager who always thinks we are able to handle more workload.  How to handle this kind of project manager?  He also always ask us what are we doing and despite we telling him the tasks we are working at he still think we are able to take on more workload  Any advise anybody? 
1933,Are PMs normally hated?,"I have had limited exposure to PMs, and the last one who was in her 60s used to always refer to her previous experiences with: ""At the end of the project, I was the most hated person, but the project got done.""  She was a very experienced having done two SAP implementation, and many projects in the banking industry. She also mentioned that after a big project she'd leave on a good severance package until the next project.   I am planning on moving more towards a PM role and currently as a tech lead my experience has been very positive maintaining very good relationships with other devs. I don't really want to lose that. Does it mean that moving towards a PM role will create more antagonisms with other devs? I've read parts of the Guide to the PMBOK, and the CompTIA Project+ manuals, but nowhere are mentioned the emerge of adverse relationships.   Does becoming a PM mean that I will deteriorate my relationships with other devs, or am I drawing too much from one person? "
1934,How do you set an initial duration for agile projects?,"I am researching agile methodologies for my organization. My question is this:     How do you prevent a project from running for far too long while using agile?   You can be writing requirements while feeding into a product backlog, the dev team can run with a sprint backlog while other requirements are being fulfilled.  What is to keep a growing requirements list from extending a project for far too long? How do you set that initial boundary so you can determine if the project has gone too far? "
1935,Is WIFO a good project management method?,"Is WIFO (Worst In, First Out) a good project management method? That is, should projects always prioritize work on the part or component that is the worst?  Will WIFO make project quality more even by working on the most negative parts first, or will it lead to one part being the ""edge"" that you focus on, even though quality is already good enough? "
1936,Roles mapping between Scrum and XP methodologies,"A lot of people mix Scrum and XP methodologies. But these methodologies have different set of roles. I tried to make mapping between them. This is result:   ________________________________ |    Scrum roles    |  XP roles  | |___________________|____________| | Development Team  | Programmer | |                   |   Tester   | |___________________|____________| |   Product Owner   |  Customer  | |___________________|____________| |    Scrum Master   |   Coach    | |                   |  Tracker   | |___________________|____________| |        N/A        | Consultant | |___________________|____________| |        N/A        |  Big Boss  | |___________________|____________|   Is this correct? I have big doubts about this.  Update    A little explanation of my question. The question is, to which roles in Scrum I should delegate authority of XP roles.  In case of the Development Team it's easy. All teams already have Programmers and Testers.  For Product Owner it's easy too. Product Owner speaks on behalf of the Customer. So, Product Owner in Scrum is the same that Customer in XP.  Delegate authority of Coach is harder. Should it be Scrum Master, because he controls compliance the methodology. Or Scrum Master responsible only for Scrum, and XP Coach should be another person.  The same problem with Tracker. Who should be the conscience of team? Scrum Master or it's better to appoint this to another person? "
1937,How to keep a Scrum of Scrums meeting short and efficient given that reporting on non-technical issues can take a long time?,"We are running a project with a team of around 60 people using Scrum. Half of the team reports to one project manager; half to another project manager. Those 2 project managers meet with the test lead and the program manager in a daily Scrum of Scrums (SoS). Given that this is new, there is some concern about keeping the SoS short and efficient.   I've read several good articles on the topic of SoS, but most focus on technical integration between the Scrum teams via the SoS. What about reporting non-technical issues and status during the SoS?  Specifically, the project managers are not technical (and neither is the program manager). How detailed should the (non-technical) report be in the SoS and how can we keep this short and efficient? "
1938,How should a team handle disagreements about story-point estimates in Scrum?,"During estimation, the Product Owner presents a user story that seems clear to a team that usually knows their strengths and weaknesses, and that is not hostile. What should the Scrum Master do if the story is judged very differently by the team members, but they can't convince each other enough to agree on a story-point estimate?  For example, let's say two opinions arise. Some see this as a rather easy story (e.g. 2 points) and others foresee technical complications and judge that the story should be 20 points. The 2-point voters say, ""I understand your opinion, but don't think those complications are valid."" The 20-point voters say, ""The past tells us that these things are always a lot more complicated then they seem.""  I assume that if the issue is not clarified the 20-point faction will not commit to the user story if it is (in their eyes) under-estimated.  What should the Scrum Master do in this case? Go for the average? Choose the worst case? Or accept this user story as ""high-risk"" with only a semi-commitment during Sprint Planning? "
1939,"In kanban, what did you do when there's a temporary delay on some card?","In kanban, you shouldn't move the card reverse to previous state right? If that so, what should I do when there's something like temporary stop this card until the committee board approve the change to this card. Do it need to stay there to waste the WIP? Should I need to remove it from it from kanban board temporary and redo the flow again when the committee board approve? "
1940,Defining Story Independent Tasks in Scrum,"I know that in Scrum this is the hierarchy for defining things to do:     Theme -> Epic -> Story -> Tasks   My question is. I got some tasks that I consider story-independent, for example, configuring some stuff in the production environment for a web app.  Can I define Tasks that are not related to a Story?. Or, how is the correct way to define this?.  Thanks in advance!!!. "
1941,How to manage a project when not every member is proficient in a common language?,"I am currently building a Project Management Plan for a new project where members will come from different cultural background. I clearly identified that not all the project members will share proficiency in a common language (e.g. English).  Is there a project management approach which can efficiently take this limitation into consideration? Is it just a human resource management issue, or can we address this limitation within the project management practice?  How can our team overcome communication issues within the project when members are not sharing the same language? "
1942,MS Project 2010 - How to import tasks with dependencies,"I'd like to use MS Project to analyse aircraft maintenance work force requirements for the next 18-24 months.  The maintenance is a combination of repetitive and one-off servicings.  I have task requirements for each servicing in Access, along with dependencies. Planners manage which servicings are performed during which maintenance events.  Given a high level schedule for maintenance events, I'd like to import the servicings and sub-tasks attached to each maintenance event, including task dependencies.  Conceptually I can see where most of the data goes, and that I will have to be careful with task identification, but what I can't see is where the task dependency type (SF/FS/FF/SS) and lag are in the import/export maps? Is it possible to import these parameters? "
1943,How to deal with tasks detalization in sprint planning?,"I have a newbie question. Let's suppose that for a sprint backlog we choose one user story from product backlog: ""As a photography junky I want to be able to make a collection of favorite photos"".   And then we want to add some more in-detail tasks, for instance ""making a mockup"" for UX-designers, ""making changes to model"" for backend developers and doing front-end implementation of design ideas.   So what is the best practice for that? Do we add these sub-tasks to sprint backlog, or we create separate ""detailed to-do"" backlog? Do we add story points to each sub-task?   With stories points it's an especially interesting problem, because if we add sub-tasks to sprint backlog we are counting tasks twice: first for user-story in general and second for it's parts in form of subtasks.  "
1944,Managing a project with the Boss/Owner as a Development Team Member,"A friend of mine has come up with a great idea for a product.  He has gathered up a group of friends, who think the idea rocks, and is well on the way to convincing them(/us) to donate 16 hours/week of our time to make this dream a reality. While there is no money involved (yet) he would like to handle this as a proper commercial project.  He came to me and knowing that I have abit of project management experience, asked if I could be the PM for it.  He doesn't want to handle the management. while it was initially his dream and his charisma that is getting a team together, once it is underway, he just wants to do dev work.  However at the end of the day, He is still the 'Owner', still the guy to sign off on the finished product etc.   How is this going to play out?   In all my experience the Product owner/sponsor has been well above the devs, and is generally extremely hands off. Often only getting updates monthly  What conflicts are likely Should I create a semiformal written social contact outlining various peoples responsibilities and rights for the development of the product?  "
1945,How to avoid ms project schedule task before status day,"I notice a strange behavior of ms project when I use leveling resource.   For example, I split the work of my team into two main activity (main task1, main task2); I added 6 task each of a duration of 3 days each.  Then I add the project start date, for example, October 8, I assign a resource to the tasks, and I level my resource.   The only constraint I put is ""main task2"" must start after ""main task1"". The project looks like the following:  Now I would like to report the status at 16 October, so I set status date 16/10 and then I received input from HD1 he worked 16h on task1 and 8h on task3. The remaining work for task1 and task3 remain the same as estimated at the beginning.  After updating the plan with ""Update project"" button, look like the following:    Now I would like to level HD1 and what I got is:    Task4 and Task5 are set before status day!!! But I would expect that all task are level after the status date not before?  Which are the right settings to enable such kind of behaviour?  More in general I have a plan where resource are shared with other higher prio activities on other projects and I would like to track how much time they are working on my project and how much time they spend on a single task. Have you think a different approach is better?  Thanks a lot for your help "
1946,Who should go to a Scrum Backlog refinement meeting?,"So at my workplace we're following scrum and we've started to have backlog refinement meetings periodically.   Some of us in the Development team feel like this meetings are not very productive and are just a waste of time. It does not help that the team is distributed between Madrid, Spain and Mexico City, Mexico but we've barely started to work this way.   Because of this some of us feel like not everybody should go to this meeting.   Do you think that everybody should go to every refinement meeting? Should it be a rotationary thing? Is there any literature about this? "
1947,Best practices for robust enterprise level software development (using python Django),"We are building a software project (using python Django and a bunch of other Open Source technologies). The project is fairly big. To give an idea, it has over 50 templates.  Our team is composed of people inexperienced in Django. Its the first django project for all of us. As such, whenever a feature is wanted, everyone just follows the first approach that comes to their mind, with hardly any idea of its consequences on what has been done earlier. Nobody looks at the big picture. As a result, things that were working in the past break down often.  We have two major problems.    First, as mentioned above, what worked earlier breaks later.  Second, when the developers are given features to implement, they do that on their own computers and show them to be working in the weekly demo to the client. But when these components of the project are integrated into the main part, something or the other breaks.   At present, we have somehow managed to finsh half of our project (also, the project has been delayed by 1 year). Half of it still remains. Also, a new project has come up. I have been given the task to identify the root causes of the above two issues and suggest how to minimise them. If we do that, the new project would be developed in a better way.  Integration testing with automated tests is one way that I can think of to catch the bugs. But my aim here is to somehow prevent them from being created in the first place, at least minimise them.  How can I increase robustness of our code. In other words, what are best practices for enterprise level Django projects ?  Can someone, specially people experienced in managing projects please suggest me the right approaches or point in the right direction ? "
1948,Project 2010 schedule a task ALAP using a deadline,"I have a task with fixed duration that must finish by a certain date. It has several predecessors. If I schedule it manually (start and finish date) it obviously works OK, but I would rather schedule it with just a finish date and ask to schedule ALAP.  (That way if the constraint date changes, the start date and all predecessors will update accordingly, without me having to remember to also change the start date.)  I have tried setting with a deadline and ALAP, but it schedules the task to finish two weeks before the deadline (even if I delete all predecessors).  Why?  Does the deadline not affect scheduling at all?  Is there any way I can schedule it to finish on my deadline? "
1949,What does SLE stand for in ITIL?,"In ITIL   An SLA is a Service Level Agreement (potentially a legal contract) An SLO is a Service Level Objective (and thus could be a KPI) An SLR is a Service Level Requirement (a clause in an SLA? a required level for an SLO?) But what does SLE stand for?    From the context, it looks like it is a soft version of an SLA. "
1950,Scrum Review Meetings - Real World,"Scrum Review Meetings in theory look good on paper.  But in real world , do this review meetings yield anything positive continuously ? Or people just go through the motions ?  I am currently in a team , where we just go through the motions and there is no feedback . I am new to Scrum and wonder if this is the norm .   This might be opinion based/broad but i would like to know about real world experiences of other scrum teams. "
1951,Does Kanban apply well in practice to software projects with data science background?,"A more or less new trend which I observe is integration of data science processes (i.e. workflows required to setup and execute experiments) to design and delivery of user facing apps.  So I assume business expects this new data science capability to introduce some new features either competitive advantages as a new product element.     ""Companies approach machine learning, and deep learning, as if they   are doing a software engineering project, with waterfall processes and   gantt charts, thinking that they can somehow totally avoid the very   difficult work necessary to design a complex and highly accurate   machine learning solution.""  (Charles Martin)   Agile seems be of neither help:     ""The traditional agile/scrum methodology combined with JIRA may not   address the nature of it being a series of hypotheses driven   experiments. Time estimates do vary over different projects based on   nature of business questions asked. Perhaps, a case-specific   discussion along with Kanban style milestone based progress estimation   may help."" (Kirti Chawla)   P.S. yet a quite clumsy formulation from a recent LinkedIN discussion, please if possible leave a comment to help get this straight (if possible) before just downvoting. Thanks.  So does Kanban help here? Or what is other proven process model? There is also a DevOps approach in this context, but this might be considered as ""too technical/low-level"" from PM perspective I assume. "
1952,How to make Agile metrics useful to stakeholders and project managers,"I have started using Actionable Agile lately. This tool is essentially used for Agile Metrics e.g. Cycle time, throughput, monte-carlo predictability etc.  Does anyone know how I can translate this data into something that is useful for project managers and stakeholders that don't necessarily understand Agile metrics.   e.g. I can predict how long it will take to do x number of stories in 30 days - how is this useful for them?  e.g. 2. I can predict at what date the in progress stories will complete - how can I provide this to them on an ongoing basis? "
1953,How often should a development team review code quality metrics so that we keep reasonable control over technical debt and code quality,"Is there any recommended practice for how frequently code quality metrics should be reviewed by the team? I'm not sure how often should we be conducting a review of code quality metrics to look for potential issues that need to be addressed. We are working in Scrum sprint cycles, but I don't know if Scrum provides any advice?  Should it be reviewed daily, weekly, end of every sprint or what?  I'm thinking here of code quality metrics such as cyclomatic complexity, etc. "
1954,What quality management frameworks are used (appropriate) today - especially in software development?,"There were ISO 9001 (and adapted version for IT TickIT), CMMI - capability maturity model, Six Sigma, IEEE software development standards and so on. All that was intended for software quality management. What is left from this and what is being applied from this in today (as of 2016)? Maybe there is some good reference, practice report, review about the current situation in industry and the recommended best practices from the scientists?  It seems to me that agile approach is used widely and there are no predefined standards except for team approved methdologies and practices. "
1955,Where can I find the PRINCE2 study material?,"I just passed the PMP 2 months ago, and I would like to start PRINCE2 foundation and practitioner exam as soon as possible.  I self-studied the PMP too and am looking for good study material.  I have search on this Q&amp;A site, and I found the following recommendation.  1. Official Prince2 Manual (equivalent to PMP PMBOK) 2. PRINCE2 For Dummies 3. PRINCE2 Study Guide by David Hinde  Do I need study all three books above? Or do I just need to study one of them? Where can I find the official PRINCE2 manual?  "
1956,Advice for developer team leading his first project,"I am a student developer team leading a comparatively small project with no experience in management. My team consists of a dozen students with little experience in development and little to no experience in management. So my questions are:   What methodology is suitable for a team like this, Agile or Scrum, or something else? What management tool should I use? Since we are students, something free would be preferable. Is Trello ok to start with? What other pieces of advice can you give me?  "
1957,Calculation of increased process efficiency,"Say I have a process taking 19 h. Some improvement measures allow to reduce the required time to 17 h (to reach the same level of output).  Does it make sense to say that the process is now (1-17/19)*100 ~= 10% more efficient?  If not, what kind of quantification of the process improvement would make sense? "
1958,What type of assessment/analysis model should I use?,"I've been brought into an organization to improve their Release Management. A couple years ago they went through a transition to Agile development. I have two work streams: Run &amp; Improve.  Boots on the ground (Run) my release management team is ensuring sprints run on time, that user stories are in Azure DevOps, sprint &amp; increment planning is generally done, etc. We're keeping things moving the same way it was when we arrived.   Higher level (Improve), my manager would appreciate a roadmap for improving things. I'm collecting data on each team and how they run their sprints (writing features/user stories, grooming (or lack thereof), sprint planning (or lack thereof), etc.)  So, I need to assess the health of the engineering process as it currently is and make recommendations for how to get it to a better state moving forward.   For context, one team does grooming weekly. Their stories are well written, with all criteria included. They are prioritized but do not include work effort needed, so I've observed many stories carry over to future sprints.   Another team (who adds upwards of 10 stories a day) does zero grooming, has poor story development (often with missing criteria) and does all of their sprint planning in one large meeting. They also include detailed work effort at the task level, so their estimates for workload have been generally accurate.  Other teams are similar to the above.  My question is, what assessment/analysis methodology would be best for this need? I.E. It's not a ""5 Whys"", but perhaps ""SWOT""? Something else? "
1959,"How to decide if a ""quick, small change"" should be implemented?","In my blog I assert that (in software projects) the quick, small change does not exist.  Let's define the quick, small change as a 30-second task.  Let's take a simple task: Deleting the extra period at the end of a sentence, or changing the hue or text size.  Why is that a big deal?  The answer is: the amount of work the software engineer has to do:     She had to: read the Change Request, find the correct file, check-out the latest revision from the Revision Control, make the change, do a Diff on the file to ensure nothing else accidentally was changed, and then Check it back into the Version Control and compile. She then had to assign the Change Request ticket to QA to be tested and the Automated Scripts updated. By now she has completely forgotten what she was working on, and will have to get back into her original project.   How is a PjM to decide when to sneak in a quick, small change, and when to push it through the official procedures for change?  Or should it be an inviolate rule that no quick, small changes, not matter what?  While this question deals with the question if you are using Agile, I'm wondering if people have other opinions for non-Agile projects for which no stories and tickets are going to be created for tiny tasks. "
1960,Any ideas for mixing a kanban with taskboards,"I am the PM of a small team of 6 programmers, recently we are trying to go more agile by including in our workflow some principles or techniques of XP, scrum, scrumban and lean.   A very important tool is our kanban, currently we are using github+zenhub for that. Zenhub provides a simple and customizable kanban(similar to trello) fully integrated into github issues.   Our current setup looks like this.   It is some kind of combination of Taskboard Kanban and User story Kanban. But still where the 2,3 column are managed by the PO and PM while the last 3 columns are managed by the team.   The problem is that we have this mixtures of user stories and tasks, and I wonder what’s the typical approach to organize them. Some tasks are part of user stories, while others (non-functional features, chores and refactors) are not. Should they be part of the backlog? How would you improve this kanban? "
1961,Should meeting minutes be captured during Scrums of Scrums?,"We hold daily Scrum of Scrums meetings on our project. The participants (i.e. non-technical managers) each manage several smaller projects and provide updates on their projects (from their daily scrums the day before). During the Scrum of Scrums, what should be captured in writing and disseminated to the participants afterwards?  Capturing a daily agenda seems overkill. But what about minutes to be sent to the participants after the meeting? Is there real value in capturing what was done and planned in each day? Maybe just capturing the impediments (and their resolution) is the best balance between effort and value.  How can How to take minutes of meeting effectively? (which talks about meetings generally) be applied to Scrums of Scrums?  My goal is to have something that the individual managers can use to reflect their status accurately with some historical view; and to provide the program manager with a view to effectiveness in each team. "
1962,How to keep WIP down with swarming in Agile/Scrum teams?,"We are practicing swarming in our Agile/Scrum teams. However, keeping WIP (Work in Progress) down continues to be a challenge. I am familiar with the theory, but I have some questions about the practice and application of swarming.   In swarming, how should we arrange the work in such a way that team members do not step on each other's toes? We are able to get designers and developers to pitch in with testing. What can we do to cross-train testers so they can help with the design and development, too? When a story is blocked, the Scrum Master works on clearing it. In the meantime, should we not get the team started on the next story though WIP goes up?  "
1963,Hardware Development & JIRA -- How to optimize the workflow / fix version field to take advantage of burndown charts,"We're using JIRA for hardware development and have run into some issues related to the separation between the development and validation cycle. Let me explain:  We have an issue type ""Development Task"" that has a workflow like this:     Assigned > In Progress > Implemented > Build > Verified > Closed   Typically we create a bunch of tickets (we assign these as fix version 1), implement the changes in a design, send the design off to the manufacturer and get samples back. Once we get the samples back we have two types of work that need to be done:     (1) All of the tickets that we implemented prior to getting hardware -- do some sort of verification/validation (it is part of the workflow)      (2) Add new development tickets to implement more features (we assign these as fix version 2)   In order for us to build our next iteration (fix version 2)        We expect that for (1) -- all tickets are validated and moved to ""Closed""   We expect that for (2) -- all tickets are in ""Implemented""      In my ideal world, I can look at a filter of tickets (Fix Version = 2 and Status = !Closed) and that would show 0 results, which would be my Decision Gate that allows us to proceed to building the next round of hardware.  The problems:   If I want to see the exhaustive list of tickets that need to be finished up, I need to make a filter that captures: (Fix Version = 1 and Status = !Closed) OR (Fix Version = 2 and Status = ![Closed, Verified, Build, Implemented]) If I want to use the burndown chart feature, I can move all of those tickets into a sprint and set an end date, however there doesn't seem to be a right state to assign ""Resolution"" such that it always represents the correct tickets   Potential Solution:  Remove the validation tail from the ""Development Task"" and instead create new tickets. That way, the only filter you need is (Fix Version = 2 and Status = !Closed). This also fixes the burndown chart issue because resolution is assigned at the end.  Are there any other alternatives? Are we looking at this all wrong? I'd rather not have the engineers create new validation tickets if we don't have to, they have expressed that it is nice to have the full development background in the ticket when they go to do verification/validation. "
1964,How would you implement scrumban to large team performing concurrent multiple R&D projects,"I'm working in a private technological center, performing only R&amp;D projects for industrial clients and institutions... I'm looking at applying Agile methods to our activities. From all my readings, I'm looking towards scrumban.  But I have doubts about its applicability and how to set this up. We have NO experience on Agile. All is based on project managers experience, PMP or intuition...  So to sum-up, I think that my main doubts are related to: -  team size for scrumban to be manageable - issue of resources allocated to multiple projects at the same time (and we can't do it in other ways due to the nature of our activities) - issue of resources required for my project but managed in a different sub-team.  So first let me give you context, and then ask concrete questions:  I'm working in a business unit of about 50 people. We have about 150 ongoing projects. minimum project time 6 months, maximum 4 years.  Projects have their uncontrollable lifecycle with intensive sprints followed by lengthy dead time due to delay in the clients feedback, waiting for purchased components, or just fixed long timeframe but at low intensity. We are of many different specialties, so some tasks can only be performed by one person. Executing only R&amp;D contracts we have LOTS of uncertainties and risks and almost no repeatability between two projects. But since we are a private company, we need to ship results to our clients on time, within the fixed budget and with adequate quality... All the projects (mainly related to robotics, machine tools, and factory automation) require many profiles to collaborate at different stages: conceptual design; architecture design, prototyping, testing, redesign, software, electronics, mechanics etc... All this is coordinated by project managers and our head of Operations performs a monthly resources (person hour)  allocation based on a project/person matrix.  I'm leading a sub-team, targeting a specific market segment, but we are not autonomous and independent (robotics requires a tight integration of software, mechatronics and hardware integration). So we always need to interact with the other sub-teams, get tasks executed by the mechanical engineers etc...  So my questions are: 1. How can I plan my delivery date and budget in the commercial offers if later on we're using an Agile method, tending to Pull processes...   Related to question 1, how can I maintain a Gantt or any other system to estimate delivery date when using kanban or scrumban??? Are both compatibles?  I'm feeling that switching to iterative and lean processes will improve our efficiency and resource allocation efficiency, but that we will lose on predictability (on the other hand, I've never seen a Gantt plan correctly executed on time ;-) ). Is this true? On what team should I deploy the scumban: on the 50 people?? Hardly manageable, no? But if I do it on my 12 people sub-team, it will not be complete since I need engineers from the other sub-group to work on my projects...? So I would need to ""add cards"" on the other team backlog and try to fight to get them with high priority...? So what's the adequate team size? And to manage interactions between teams?? Related to question3: how should I manage the multi-projects aspects? I mean: should I try to impose scrumban at project level, or a team level? I fear that project level is not ok, since the resources in my project are also allocated to other projects and I have NO visibility on their current load and task priorities and emergencies... But at the 50 person group level, I fear that it will not be manageable, unless we perform micro-management up to the very fine tasks, with the associated management overhead... and headaches!   I hope I transmitted well our situation, that I understand as quite complex, but found in so many other companies...  Thanks in advance for sharing your opinions and advice on how/if we should deploy Agile processes in our business unit (preferably scrumban I believe)!  Very best,   Damien Sallé "
1965,"What is the typical ratio of PM/EM hours to ""work"" hours in a project?","What is the rule-of-thumb ratio of Project Manager/Engagement Manager time to overall project time (e.g. man-hours for work products) in a project? I'm especially interested in an answer within the context of a Professional Services engagement, though I presume there would also be a general answer.  For example, let's say we have a 1,000-hour project with two full-time team members working on it. How many hours should be expected from the Project/Engagement Manager on the project? 1/10, 1/20, 1/5?  Is there such a typical ratio? Does it scale/change based on the number of project members? For example, does it change if the project is 2,000 hours with four FT people over the same 500 calendar hours (~3 months)? "
1966,Why are estimates treated like deadlines?,"This is one thing that I've always taken as a given, the ""status quo"" in my line of field (software development) but never really gave it a deep thought. And even now that I do, I still don't understand.  I'm not talking about estimating something you've done over and over again, but stuff you have never built, you don't have the experience for, the specifications are incomplete (if you even have such a luxury), placing an estimate effort on powerpoint presentations during the presentation, etc.  I mean, it defeats all logic, but this is constantly what happens. Why?  Why does this always happen?   "
1967,Documenting PMP Experience,"   Possible Duplicate:   Can I apply for PMP without experiences in all processes? What are the requirements for obtaining these certifications?       I am a new member here and getting ready to take my PMP exam.  I worked as Project Leader reporting it to a project manager for a durability test for a chemical plant. The test lasted for 2 years totaling 10,000 hours of testing.  Biggest phase in the project was executing and monitoring.  I have similar experience with other testings as well. Can this monitoring phase be reported on my experience. Because two projects would total it to more than 3500 hours, required for the PMP eligibility.   I would appreciate your thoughts  "
1968,Fibonacci scale project estimates: how is it not vulnerable to misunderstanding by management?,"The Fibonacci sequence is to assist developers with project estimates. The concern is that we consistently see management use the points derived from Fibonacci sequence estimates to determine project velocity, or more importantly - developer efficiency. Which makes obvious sense to do considering that the point of any given project estimate methodology is to, well, estimate the velocity and remark on the trends.  The problem here becomes evident when you consider that a developer could easily demonstrate in one two-week sprint that they crushed 16 points worth of 1-to-2 point backlogs/tasks and then reasonably take two sprints on a single 8-point task. Now that developer has to defend herself as to why her velocity has dropped 400%.     Well she should get better at project estimates.   That's irrelevant. Considering the whole point of the Fibonacci scale is to provide some sense of exponential effort between tasks, a 1-point task vs an 8-point tasks is an 800% difference. In the case above, the developer actually underestimated but management quantitatively sees a dip in performance.     Then the team needs to define what the different points mean.   The only concrete definition a team could come to a consensus on is how much time a 1-point tasks takes vs an 8-point task but if we start trying to put time frames on it, we're defeating the purpose of this agile project estimate methodology; we might as well refer back to flat time estimates.     Well then management needs to understand that the points are exponential and that 16 points achieved in one sprint compared to 8 points in another sprint doesn't necessarily mean velocity went down.   Then why are we going through the trouble of measuring velocity if it's so relative anyways? If we're going to make management understand the complexity of each task that happened in the sprints, then why even use a point system that is consistently used to measure velocity? To be safe, why wont developers start overestimating their points so they cash in more points per sprint? All of these what-ifs and ""it depends"" doesn't sound very agile. "
1969,Splitting PM responsibility between technical lead and non-technical PM on an agile project?,"In practical terms, how do you suggest that a technical lead (me) work with a non-technical PM who is responsible for multiple projects? How should dependencies between stories, and external dependencies, be identified, discussed, planned for, scheduled and resolved? What should the division of responsibility be between me and the non-technical PM?  A non-technical PM cannot identify certain dependencies because they have no idea that they exist. Hence my question.  We are not using Scrum of Scrums (indeed we are not using full Scrum), but we are using an issue tracking system (specifically, Jira). "
1970,Is interspersing different teams a good idea?,"Update: (a PM-specific concern) Having developers working close together is valuable to my team - people tend to naturally ask more questions, get involved in code-related conversations they overhear, do more pair programming sessions etc. With the new setup, we will lose some of these benefits. Should I find ways to formalize these practices now - weekly knowledge sharing sessions, designated Scrum areas etc? How do you recapture the lost intangibles of changing a productive working arrangement for developers?  Original question:  My boss recently became head of both the BA and Developer teams, and wants to reorganize the office space and relocate everyone's cubicles so that the teams are more interspersed.  As the Dev manager, I see this as a bad idea because:   It's a threat to productivity as you can't ask peers a quick question without walking down the hall It's a hit to morale as both teams lose their individual cultures and the sense of camaraderie that comes with sitting close to people you work with   What is the right thing to do here? I appreciate the boss' vision of a closer-knit team but am not sure if he's on the right track. "
1971,Container story for repeated work,"My QA (not only QA) is performing the same work on undefined schedule. For example: a full regression test is being done with every mobile app release. This work involves not only automation test, but manual process as well and requires a ticket.  For being able to digest this work better I want 'regression testing' stories to be grouped, right now these stories are linked to an Epic.  How you guys deal (or approach) situations where exactly the same story is being played over again?  An Epic which is always in-play? A story stuck in one of the lanes?  Any input much appreciated!  Best, r0cket "
1972,How to reconcile MVP/fail fast with a 'replace existing product' project?,"In general, we as agile IT developers/PMs want to create a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) as a first iteration, get it in front of users, and then iterate and improve upon it.  How does one reconcile that with this?     ""We need a new in-house-developed app to replace the 3rd-party app we currently use, which does this and this and this and ... The new app needs to do everything the old one does. We can't turn the existing product off until the new one meets our needs.""   ...Cue 3 years of development before the 'MVP' is ready? "
1973,MS Project - Best Update Solution,"I have an existing project schedule with 4 Phases. Phases 1-3 are complete and Phase 4 just started. I have built a new separate schedule for Phase 4 due to changes, but was not sure of the best way to ""Update or Implement"" this into the existing 4 Phase Project Schedule schedule. So:  Should I Update Phase 4 by:   Pasting new into existing (leaving current Phase 4 in place, making old  inactive, for easy reference)? Pasting new Phase 4 into existing - over Phase 4 current items? Or update the dates and make changes to tasks that changed?   I would like to know the best scenario for maintaining the full scope of Existing Project with the new implemented Phase 4. "
1974,"When is ""control of a software project"" less important?","In the article titled Software Engineering: An Idea Whose Time Has Come and Gone?, Tom DeMarco says that:     To understand control’s real role, you need to distinguish between two   drastically different kinds of projects:      ■ Project A will eventually cost about a million dollars and produce   value of around $1.1  million.      ■ Project B will eventually cost about a million  dollars and produce   value of more than $50  million.      What’s immediately apparent is that control is really important for   Project A but almost not at all important for Project B.   It is not ""immediately apparent"" to me. Can anyone explain? "
1975,Why use iterations in Scrum?,"I am a Scrum Master in a 7 person team. We currently use one-week iterations for our sprints.  I find that sprint planning overhead is huge (2 hours each week for entire team), and not nearly as productive as it should be. Our team members do not care what each task costs, they rely on one or two people with context to provide the estimates. It seems team-wide sprint planning is meaningless.  Additionally, there has never been a sprint where we successfully completed ALL planned tasks. We always complete most of them, but there are always a few left over for the next sprint. It seems the time-boxed idea is not working at all, as we are never able to fully deliver. Maybe it has something to do with only two people contributing to estimates, but I don't see the team completing all features even if everyone contributes to the estimates.  I know there are literally tons of books and papers that describe how wonderful iterative and incremental development are, but it just doesn't seem to bring enough goodness to our team.  So my question is, how valuable exactly is it to keep a time-boxed iteration? If we just let one or two dedicated people maintain a strictly prioritized list and showcase deliverables as necessary, what's the downside of it? "
1976,Modelling schedule uncertainty in Microsoft Project 2010/2013,"Microsoft Project 2010 (and 2013) no longer contain PERT charts. With this in mind, what is the recommended way to model uncertainty in project time estimates?  UPDATE: I only brought up PERT diagrams because supposedly they were used for representing schedule uncertainty in the past. I don't really care about PERT diagrams. What is the best way to represent schedule uncertainty in Microsoft Project? "
1977,How to write a spike when using BDD?,"If Gherkin is used to write regular development user stories in the Scrum process, should Gherkin be used to write a spike as well? If so, given that often there is a lot of unknown information to be filled in, how can a spike be written as BDD? "
1978,BDD Gherkin definition of un-gherkin-like work,"We are dealing with the split of work which, in the old process, would have all been one big task; Now, (under Scrum) that work is split into stories and refined. We are using BDD to define those stories...  For one particular set of stories - those involved with a particular system - the changes to the system have always been defined in a particular manner. The team members are familiar with it and I am finding it difficult to convert those definitions into BDD. (Also, I do not understand the work they do as it is not in ""my wheelhouse"".)  I have discussed the BDD approach which the project is now taking with the person (as it happens, a technical BA) responsible for writing/refining those stories and while they are happy with BDD for most of our stories, informs me that it is difficult to do what I am asking; Converting to BDD for this particular system.  The task definitions, generally, involve defining the storage of database-like data and schemas, the nature of requests and responses into and out of the system to get that data and changes to the existing setup.  To be fair, if this were work defining changes to an existing MS T-SQL database I would also find it difficult to provide BDD stories.  TL;DR: How should one define BDD stories which specify technical changes to systems such as databases using gherkin? Is this even the appropriate approach? "
1979,How to take out dependancies among tasks within a scrum sprint?,"Suppose, a user story has further divided into multiple tasks; if the tasks are having dependancies among themselves then how to make sure that productivity stays stable?  I have read that we have to either slice user stories vertically or split user story. How vertical slicing works? "
1980,Can I start a new sprint without delivering the last one?,"I'll try to simplify my questions and avoid story telling.  1) Can I start a new Sprint without delivering the last one?  2) During Sprint 2, can I include items into Sprint 1?  3) How many undeliverable Sprints can I have in my product?  I am facing a flexibility problem where the client says that he can change the framework any time and in any way he wants. He argues that Scrum predicts flexibility.  I'd like to know if there is a 'Scrum way' to deal with this, 'cause in the Scrum Guide I didn't find anything. "
1981,Risk Management techniques in Agile project development,"I am currently doing a research study in Risk Management for Agile project development. As we know, there are a few steps involved in Risk Management in Agile project development, such as:   Agile Risk Identification Agile Risk Analysis Agile Risk Prioritisation Agile Risk Responses Agile Risk Resolution Agile Risk Monitoring   But my question is: are there any specific techniques or tools used by the organizations to mitigate risks? If yes, can anyone share with me the available tools or techniques that can be used to mitigate the risks? Currently, I am still trying to understand the differences between Agile Risk Management and Traditional Risk Management. "
1982,How to structure our organization and define agile teams in a multiple concurrent projects context?,"I know that the agile concept requires the teams to be small, autonomous and self-sufficient, but how to organize teams when forming small and autonomous teams is almost impossible as each member controls a specific technology and thus must work in 10 different concurrent projects?  Any best-practice on defining a business unit structure to be able to apply agile management and cope with concurrent projects and understaffing issues?  I find it really hard to redefine the structure of our business unit to be able to generate Agile-compatible teams where all members are only allocated to one project.  Same complexity to try to allocate a project to only one of these agile-teams. We need that all developers work concurrently on various projects.  I could do a complete business unit Kanban, but we are 50 people, so I anticipate hell when having to manage Backlogs and team meetings.  Any advice on if/how to structure our group to allow for agile project management?    Further details  Business unit structure:   about 50 people about 150 ongoing projects working like a small company with Project managers, SW developers, mechanical and electronics engineers, workshop technicians etc… with a very wide field of technologies to manage all customer specific projects (we do not develop and sell products, but specific ""engineering"" projects)  minimum project time 6 months, maximum 4 years R&amp;D projects only, so requirements are changing during the project   Projects have their uncontrollable lifecycle with intensive periods followed by lengthy dead time due to delay in the clients feedback, waiting for purchased components, or just fixed long timeframe but at low intensity.   Bottlenecks we have:    each individual member of the group has a specificity required in various project other members are not proficient (enough) on this other technology  "
1983,How to use Jira to indicate blockers in a Kanban system?,"We are already using Jira to visualize the work of ~30 people, and it's being rolled out to other teams too, so this number will increase dramatically.    One of the enhancements we need, is to be able to tag a ticket as blocked - and to be able to collect the blockers at the end of a month (or week, or whatever), and discuss them in a retrospective, for the purpose of spotting trends and solving blocker clusters.  The best way I've come up with, is to create a new issue type called ""Blocker"" and to log new blockers whenever needed.  This lets me put as much detail as I want into the blocker, and it also lets me measure their lead &amp; cycle time.  There's a gaping hole with this approach though - how do I make the blocker look attached to the related project ticket?  Is there some other way I'm not thinking of?  It would be ideal if we could put some kind of indicator on an issue in Jira-Agile, to highlight it as blocked. "
1984,High Level Budget for Project Charter,"How much detail should go into putting together a high level budget for a project charter?   For example, should I blindly accept the Suggested Budget for the Project before I even breakdown the tasks or the Planning Phase? "
1985,Can my customer ask for his money back?,"I am a lone developer who built a billing system for a customer as moonlighting job.  We had worked together previously on a number of occassions and as a reults no contract was ever signed between the two of us, no were any precise requirements given up front. The customer supplied some very high level requirements and I worked with him to extract more detailed requirements as the system was built.    The customer has been successfully using the system for a few months now for it's exact indended purpose and it meets all of his requirements that were outlayed when the project began (a fixed price quote was given). He has paid the full amount of the software about 6 months ago.  The customer hasn't yet accepted the software as 'live'.  He has sent me two small defects in that period since he stared using the system for it's intended purpose.  On both occassions I had a fix installed with two days.  After not hearing form the customer for over a month, I spoke with him yesterday, as he was wanting a quote for new work.  I informed him that I am not taking on new work as I do not have time.  At this point he told me if I do not do this work for him, for which he will pay, he will ask for his money back on the existing system.  He rationale was that a system that cannot be supported is of no use to him.    He owns all intellectual property for the system and has all source code.  When I mentioned that any developer could support the system, he said he wants the original developer to support it.    I have a very bad business relationship with this customer, after a number of refusal to pay invoices, and both do not wish to continue working with him, or doing any moonlighting of any type for any one, as I no longer have the motivation or the time, with a young family to look after.  I was wondering what the best way to handle this situation would be.  I expect I'll need to seek legal advice.  Is the customer entitled to his money back?  ...even though he is using the system for it's intended purpose and he has generated considerable invoices from it (well into the hundreds of thousands of dollars, money he would not have been able to make without the system) and he yesterday said there are no problems with it.  If push comes to shove I am now prepared to return the money.  What about getting compensated for the work to build the system?    The question of providing ongoing support was never raised before an agreement to do the work was made.  This has now been going on for 3 years, when it should have been a three month engagement.  The system was completed, awaiting UAT, 3 months after we worked out the detailed requirements in September 2008.  Since then I have made small paid changes and a number of free changes, as the customers business evolves, but he still hasn't formally accepted the system is live, even though I've told him it is Live and it meets all his initial requirements.  Really not sure what to do as the experience has put me off software development.  A problem, as it's been my career for the last 10 years and the sole source of income for my family. "
1986,Advice for Special Short Sprints (2-5 Days)?,"Most of our Sprints are 2 weeks long, but occasionally, we want to meet a special deadline in less time (2-5 days). So, we do a special ""short"" Sprint that is a bit different from our normal routine.  Do you have any advice for these Sprints? Are they okay, or should we eliminate them somehow? "
1987,"What can we do with a ""mispointed"" story in Scrum?","Is it OK to repoint the story at the beginning of the new sprint to reflect the size that we have now discovered it to be so our velocity is more accurate?   On rare occasions, our team will work a story we thought we broke down into a small, granular story, but it ends up taking the entire sprint and carrying over (it may or may not have an impediment on it). Can we assign a different story-point value to it to reflect the effort it actually took to complete?  As an alternative, can we update the definition of done so that the story can be closed in the current sprint? I understand this is not ideal and could be abused so that everything closes at the end of a sprint, but I am talking about the stories where you know you have gone WAY above the original estimate of points and you don't want your velocity predictor to be skewed. "
1988,Different Scrum Teams Assisting Each Other - Good or Bad?,"I was reading a comment:     It affects empiricism of [the Scrum Team receiving aid] because both the outputs and outcomes of that Sprint have been affected. [...] The professionalism of knowledge sharing is certainly desired, and assisting another Scrum Team is not prohibited by the framework, there are probably more effective ways to achieve the desired outcomes.   And that got me thinking - does it make sense for different Scrum Teams in the same organization to assist each other with their work, or would the loss of stable throughput outweigh the gains in knowledge sharing? If one should refrain, then how should knowledge sharing be facilitated? "
1989,"In Scrum, what is an impediment?",One of the questions in Scrum is What impediments have you encountered? But what exactly is an impediment? Can you give me an example? 
1990,What are reasons against cross-functional teams?,"I often work in companies where functional departments are rigidly separated. To me this seems inefficient, as adds a lot of communication overhead.  Are there reasons why companies prefer this type of structure? Does it offer more opportunities to learn from team members working in the same field?  I've especially seen this in agencies where people are involved in many projects simultaneously. Are there environments where cross-functional teams are a bad idea? "
1991,How can we apply Agile to a consulting firm,"As a consultant working for a consulting firm, planning projects using Agile/Scrum methodology can be quite challenging.   Considering we do not work full-time for our clients, it is hard to use Scrum to analyze velocity, make good time estimates and always keep work in the pipeline. It is possible to manage the user stories, assign the product owner / scrum master / dev team role or estimate using points, but the whole idea that we can't track our velocity makes us lose a big part of what Scrum is all about.  How would you approach that challenge? Is it possible or recommended to put every client's user stories in one shared backlog, including our internal user stories (like Website development, looking for additional clients, developing in-house projects) and prioritize them depending on the budget or availability they have? This way, we could track our internal velocity, collaborate on multiple projects together and track our consulting firm ROI at the Product owner level (which could be the Practice owner?). "
1992,"PMP Experience ""within the past five years""","Few years ago I looked into getting the PMP and main reason I didn't was that the ""experience verification form"" required that all hours listed be within the past five years. Looking at their site today I'm unable to find this stated as a current requirement or on the forms to apply; though I am able to find old reference to the ""with the past five years"" requirement, see:  [website]Was the window for experience removed? Along the same lines, is there a window of time that applies to PM training experience hours required for the ""contact hours""? "
1993,Purchase a physical scrumboard?,"Any ideas on where to acquire a pre-drawn physical scrumboard? I want to save the hassle of preparing one and to just buy it somewhere. If there are nice boards like that would also look professional and stylish I would definitely get one.   Any ideas? Was anyone interested in this before?  Thanks,  Tim "
1994,What is the difference between framework vs methodology?,"What the difference is between a methodology and a framework? And where does the process come into that story?  And perhaps, it would be good to have this comparison explained by using methodologies like Prince2, Framework like Scrum, ... "
1995,Dynamically queueing tasks to better plan ahead,"I'm no project manager but I have a time management issue. I'm a programmer in a small team with plenty of tasks distributed among many projects and I'm responsible for managing my time.  I'm alright at analysis/design on small to medium projects and at slicing down work into reasonably-sized tasks. I generally produce decent estimates.  Unfortunately I still suck at placing estimated end dates on tasks. I go by instinct based on my perception of my current workload. As a result it's a very hit and miss process. I'm wishing for some sort of dynamic queue of tasks ordered by priority over a timeline. That way I could provide sensible estimated end dates for new tasks and I could see when changes would compromise my meeting certain end dates. What tool could help me? How is such a thing generally called?  (We use Jira as an issue tracker, although we may change for something simpler in the future.) "
1996,Stakeholder view of projects without time?,"I'm a PM for a small development team. We have a mix of large transformation projects and small improvement projects.   We're not good at estimating in man hours (and in fact I'm yet to meet a team of people that can do this consistently in any role).   As a result we've agreed within the team to use story points to estimate complexity, and over the next few sprints we'll figure out what the right amount of story points per sprint looks like.   My question is, how can I guide the rest of the business away from using time as a measure? How do we translate story points to allow them to make priority decisions? What's the best way to represent progress on projects (both inside and outside of a sprint? Points done vs Points remaining? Points per person? Something else?  "
1997,Reduce Scope or Kill the Project?,"My goal is to implement business application. I have 10 days to complete, and my estimation says that i need 40 days.   In a team there are two programmers and one programmer-PM.  I assume one functionality takes 3-4 days to implement. So estimation makes us  around 6 functionalities possible, and also five is completed. We have to create 20 functionalities.  How to complete complete application in this circumstances? If we assume that not - should we trim user stories for most important? Or it is a dead march? "
1998,When are Story Points and priority estimated in the planning phase of agile?,"In our agile requirements gathering sessions (not sure of the technical name sorry), where we engage with the product owner to list all stories that are required for the implementation, we typically estimate story points and priority as we go.  Is this the correct methodology? And further is it the most effective? Or should we be listing all our user stories, then going back and prioritising and estimating SP? "
1999,Looking for recommendations for Project and Change Management tools,"I'm currently researching software project management tools for a team of 12 developers. In addition to project management, we'd like to handle help desk tickets and a SOX compliant change management process. I've used Atlassian JIRA in the past (and loved it), but it was for a smaller team with simpler requirements.  Key features we're looking for:  Project Management   Time tracking by task Multiple resources per project Allow requesters (users within our company) to track task progress, preferably without a user license (may be deal killer for JIRA since we have hundreds of users and JIRA requires a user license per login)   Help Desk   Allow requesters (users within our company) to track task progress, preferably without a user license (may be deal killer for JIRA since we have hundreds of users and JIRA requires a user license per login) Escalate ticket if assigner does not respond within a certain time frame   Change Management   Workflow that allows a request to be approved by multiple team members (Lead Dev, DBA, Dev Manager, Dept Manager of requester, etc) Audit trail that gives us SOX compliance   Has anyone successfully used a single product for software project management, help desk support tickets and change management? If not a single product, what do you use and why? "
2000,Creating defect stories and inserting them immediately,"When we have a story which can pass but produces a defect to be fixed, the PO or BA involved will usually write a new story and immediately insert it into the sprint on the basis that it is important enough because it is a business priority.  Is this proper for scrum? If not, what should be done? "
2001,How do you deal with client-related hold-ups in Scrum?,"Most of our projects get held up by waiting on client assets. Working under waterfall, we're often on many projects at once and can work on something else while waiting.  We really want to do scrum ""by the book"" and have one team on a project at a time so we can really focus on those individual projects. But what happens when we get held up waiting on the client? In some cases, assets not provided by the beginning of the sprint could cause project backlog items associated with those assets to go back into the backlog in exchange for those that actually can be accomplished, but what about when it gets to the point where everything left in the backlog depends on those assets?  Pausing on the project to work on something else would be very disruptive and the team would lose momentum, and waiting around doing nothing until the assets arrive isn't an option. "
2002,"As an outsider, how would I know overall health of a Scrum Team?","I'm not a member of Scrum Team. However, I'd like to get a sense of the health of a Scrum Team. What is the best way to understand a Scrum Team's performance?  To be more specific, things I would like to know:   Is the team running at maximum efficiency? Is the team improving over the time? Is the team motivated enough? Is the team meeting their commitments? Is the team meeting coding standards?  "
2003,How to choose and manage a sales team that are given great flexibility?,"I have come to a situation where I have to choose around 10 individuals to do sales for our company. A salesman per department (e.g electronic, cosmetic and so on).  My concern is that the salesman are getting immense flexibility. They are given the right for an entire department, % of commission as their salary and the free to manage it the way the want as long as they comply with our policies. They are pretty much given such flexibility, that could be considered as if they where starting their own business.  As the Project Manager for this new tactic, what is the best way I can continue given they have this freedom and flexibility without decreasing the probability of sales?  How can I manage what would be consider contractors, that aren't obligated to report to the team leader?  "
2004,How can I learn to break down a big software project into more manageable tasks in terms of progress monitoring?,"One thing I constantly see project management books talk about is the necessity of a method of tracking progress. One you break down the big picture into many smaller tasks, it becomes easier to see how quickly you're moving forward, which helps organization and moral.   But how exactly are software projects broken down into smaller pieces to measure progress? Would you have tasks like, 'complete database helper class' or 'write this part of the business logic in methods'? I assume test cases are often used to determine when a task is actually completed, but how are they grouped? Is there a test case for each class, each package, each concept of business logic?  Can someone provide some examples of how a real world project was broken down into smaller, monitorable units of progress? "
2005,What are project development methodologies and why should I use them?,"I've heard a lot about Scrum and Agile, but what, in a single sentence, do they do to help projects? Are they a general suggestion to the recipe for success, or do they get into specifics of organization and time distribution? Why are they in such wide use today? What negative factors do they combat and mitigate?  (obviously elaboration is more than welcome, but summing their reason for existence up in one sentence would be highly desirable as well.) "
2006,Can I use the PMP Exam book to prep for a CAPM exam?,"I purchased Rita Mulcahy's PMP Exam Prep(8th Edition) and I have already finished the first eight chapters. However, I have realised that this book is only for experienced PMP attendants not for CAPM. But I'm going to take CAPM exam on 24th June and now I'm pretty stressed and sad.   Should I buy the same writer's CAPM Exam Prep Book or go on with PMP Book?  The problem is simulation exams. Even these exams are gonna be useless for me I think. Instead of studying PMBOK Guide can I take the exam?  Helpful links for mock exams for CAPM could be great as well. "
2007,Leading Virtual Teams,"I'm writing a paper on leading virtual teams.  Are there any certain leadership practices/theories/approaches that are unique to virtual teams? I've skimmed a few books on the topic, but I just realized that many of the books talk about leadership practices in general, nothing really unique about leading virtual teams. Are there certain approaches to leading virtual teams that you don't find elsewhere? "
2008,Scrum for the DBA?,"I really wanted to find out what people out there think about Scrum for a SQL Server Production DBA.  I have seen one article ([website]There might be things and perspective changes that happened since 2011 to the present 2017 situation.  Here's something that could help you provide you some insight to the type of situations that the production DBA deals with on a usual basis:  1.Schema/Data Promotions from Test Servers to production servers.  2.Monitoring Servers/Databases continuously throughout the day(Checking the server for space, Memory,CPU etc)  3.Backups/Restores/Disaster Recovery Planning and Implementation.  4.Installation/Management/Monitoring/Usage of DBA Tools like Idera, Redgate, Different versions of Visual Studio's/SSMS's etc.  5.Creating/Scheduling/Monitoring Jobs/SSIS packages, SQL Scripts.  6.Sometimes Creation/Deployment of SSIS packages/SSRS reports/SSAS Cubes.  7.Maintenance/Patch Management/Upgrades/Migrations of SQL Servers etc.  How does all of this fall into Scrum and how to deal with it?  Scrum is being implemented as a new thing from the management side and points are being assigned for everything that is being done. 1 point is being equated to 1 hour, 1/2 point is 1/2 hour and so on. So everyday the DBA is being asked what is being done in the daily scrum and lets say a Database is being backed up, the manager(who is also a scrum master) says: All you are doing is setting up the script and letting the backup go. You aren't doing a thing until the backup is done. What should the DBA do? So no points for monitoring the servers/databases since they are a 24*7 job or rather a full 8 hour job for the DBA.  In scrum/sprint, is time really associated with Fibonacci series(0,1,2,3,5,8,13,21 and so on) points associated with time in someway or the other? From what i have learned this is something to do with complexity and never to equate with time, but is that what management does anyway?  But what really is happening in the name of scrum is that, we are being asked to provide the story, estimated/actual points/time for the story, time started, time completed, and details as to what was done to complete the story. Almost the same as this!! (Is Scrum a status report meeting or a developer meeting?)  Is this Agile/Scrum. What is it?   How Does scrum fit in for the production DBA in this way?  Are you a DBA that uses scrum?If so, how do you make it work? If not, how do you get around the manager who loves scrum and insists that you be a part of it?  "
2009,Adding a subproject at top level,"When I add a subproject to a master project, it always becomes a part of the project just above it. It is indented one more level.  Must I only create subprojects on the top row of the project?  Using the Outdent Task icon and Ctrl-Shift-Left have no effect. How can I outdent the subproject? "
2010,How can I best facilitate the transition of responsibilities from one team to another?,I am currently transitioning responsibility from one team to another. All tasks that are handled by team A will be in the future handled by team B. The tasks are mostly support.  Is there any check list that should be followed in such situations? What are the most common problems in such situations? 
2011,Are there advantages to joining PMI before paying for/taking PMP exam?,"I had read somewhere that you can receive a discount on the PMP exam fee if you are a PMI member, but this seems debatable when you consider that you need to pay for the membership.  Other than a digital copy of the PMPBOK, have any of you found benefits in having the PMI membership?  Also, is it required to join a local PMI chapter when getting a membership? "
2012,Zero bug software development?,"We are looking into a zero bug policy, but I wondered how best to represent this in sprint planning.   Should we be planning some 'empty' story points to cover this work? Does anyone else do this? If so how does it work for you? "
2013,Where does the scrum team's authority ends and the development manager's begins?,"In a scrum team, the team has decided that they want to hold their morning standups at 10am. The team is in London, and claimed that 9:30 is marginally early, in the sense that sometimes public transport isn't working properly, high traffic etc.  The scrum master has conveyed the message that the team has decided to hold their morning standups at 10am. The manager's answer was, ""no...why? so that everyone can come in at 10? No, I want the stand ups to take place at 9:30"".  Who's call should be at the end of the day, what time the standups take place and other such affairs? "
2014,What are the clusters in a project?,"I am very new in project management. My question is: what are the clusters in a project?  How do I identify them? By watching this link (tutorial), I see that they look like deadline scheduling? But I do not know for sure. Can anyone help me understand? "
2015,Requirements for PMI's PMP course,"I am interested in working towards my PMP certification.  I have a 3 year BSc degree from someplace in Canada which I got back in the mid 1980s.  As I read the requirements, they specify a 4 year Bachelors would be required.  So I guess I am in the other group which needs 7500 hours experience.  Do I read this correctly?  Also, I work for a small company.   Our software development projects go on for years. I am project manager on a number of our large projects, but since we are a small company I have to do much of the programming work myself, for example.    So I am managing the team of programmers for the entire development phase of the project, but I also do my share of programming.     The development phase might take two years and I am managing this aspect of the project the whole time, interacting with team members, the customers and other stakeholders, etc.  But the actual time spent 'managing' is smaller than the amount of time 'working'.  Can I just take the whole two year term of the project that I managed as applicable experience or do I have to go through my work log and pick out only the moments in time where I was not doing project work?  If I can only use active management time and not the time for the programming tasks I assigned myself I cannot see that I would ever be able to get 7500 hours management experience while working at a small company.

2016,What is prerequisite for starting a Sprint?,What are the mandatory prerequisites to start a Sprint?  The Product Owner makes decision to start the Sprint; what are the Scrum Master's/Development Team's roles in making the decision?  Does the Scrum Master just coach in general terms for this decision or does s/he have to provide specific guidance? 
2017,How do you associate a bug identified after customer acceptance with the relevant epic?,"In my understanding there are two kinds of bugs:   1. Bugs that are identified before an acceptance by the client  2. Bugs that are identified afterwards  In JIRA I think it is necessary to associate bug type 1 with an Epic as they are a condition for complete the Epic.   But how do you treat bug type 2? As far as I understand it the epic should already be closed (see my related question). Do you associate no epic at all? Do you use a ""bugs"" epic? Anything else? "
2018,Is it possible to have process outputs that are not products?,"I always thought that a process has to have an output in terms of a deliverable. However, I found the following in the ISO 12207:  process outcome observable result of the successful achievement of the process purpose Note 1 to entry: An outcome statement describes one of the following: • production of an artefact; • a significant change in state; • meeting of specified constraints, e.g., requirements, goals, etc.   What would be an example of a ""change in state"" outcome of a process in practice? Whatever it is, would there not usually be a document produced to provide confirmation? "
2019,"Sprint Review: How to prevent every single type of story from being ""reviewed""","The team decided to make every work item into a sprint story. This means that along with development stories that result in a product increment, a sprint also contains stories for integration testing, user acceptance testing and research/pre-development work.   Sprint reviews are scheduled at the end of each sprint. So far, stakeholders have not been available, but the PO and the Division director attends. Every completed story is reviewed/demonstrated. This has resulted in reviews with full agendas such that there is no time to actually inspect the product increment. We are shown charts, spreadsheets and word documents.   I asked my manager (Dev manager and PO) that we limit review items to those that result in product increment. But I was told that will mean only developers get to review the stories, non-developers will feel left out and since Agile is about people over processes, every one who completes a story will review/demo it.    What argument can I make to convince management to limit the reviews to just the product increment? Or am I wrong to do so? "

2021,One channel per task to track all discussions related to particular tasks in Slack: good or bad idea?,"Wanting to quickly see everything that has been said regarding a particular task is very common. And often impossible, because both channels and PM contain discussions about multiple tasks. Therefore, not only discussions about a particular task come in pieces, these pieces are mixed with pieces related to other tasks!  Having one channel per task seems aberrant, but it effectively solves this problem. Has anyone tried something like this? Does it work? "
2022,Project 2016 update task start dates - am I asking too much?,"new to the site and to Project so please bear with me. I'm tinkering with Project and have set up a simple schedule, 4 auto schedule tasks, all effort driven and linked FS.  Task 2 has a duration of 2 days assigned to it and is due to finish let's say 9th August.  If I update on the 9th and find that after 2 days the task is only 50% complete yet it has had labour there for 2 days. I go to Project Update and ask it to re-schedule from the 9th August but it doesn't move Task3 start date onwards. The delay is reflected in the Gantt chart but not in the entry table view. Do I need to manually alter the start date for task 3 so it shuffles things forwards? Also, if I look at task usage  the task has been spread across 3 days instead of 2 but it has put 0.5 hrs into the second day and 7.5 hrs into the third. Do I need to manually re-assign the hours for the three days from 16 to 24? Hope someone can steer me straight on this one. Many thanks, Laurence.  "
2023,Testing big systems in agile,"In the organization I work for we have a HUGE product. It has about ~10 associated scrum teams. We have two types of releases: 1. The big ones 2. Service packs  For #1, we have system QA.  For #2, we have service pack QA.   Both test system, that includes areas of other scrum teams.  I am uncomfortable with this approach because then if someone finds something, either it's at 11th hour and we have to run around or they find something but scrum teams are sometimes not aware.  Have you faced such situation? Did you find a way out or this is the same model that is followed in your organization as well?  Thanks in advance. "
2024,Reviewing a difficult project,"I have been asked to help a company review a software project that has been very very painful,  putting a lot of strain on the client relationship as well as between individuals as well as teams in the company.   Both based on research I have undertaken previously as well as various blogs I've read on the topic I intend to undertake various stakeholder interviews, attend the project sunset meeting and a sprint retrospective.   I have started conducting causal analysis focussing on:   Specification: Quality/ambiguity, scope creep, documentation.  Communication:  How were individual issues communicated? how well were the project teams included in the planning process? How did the distributed team (5 office locations - 12 people) affect communications. Resourcing and Planning: How well was the project planned in advance, how well were estimates met? Were people available when they were meant to be on the project? Did skills of the people match requirements? Causes of Rework: How well were the individual team members qualified for the tasks they had to repeat? How long did it take for completed tasks to be tested and errors to be identified? Complexity: How complex were the tasks? Eg. was there a need to include an architect to help a developer plan the design?    When conducting a project review are there any additional areas that you think I should be considering? Can you share best practice for soliciting information and communicating my findings in a practical and constructive way?  "
2025,How can I organize 3 developers to work together with 2 clients?,"I started working in a stock broker that hired me and more two developers to build a software to help them. I am the newest member of the development team. My friend, another developer in the team, asked me to create a software engineering model to apply in the project, because the way they are doing now is not working. They do not have a specific model to follow, they just decide what to do verbally, the two owners of the stock broker (which are in this case, the clients) ask them to develop a feature so the developers just stop what they were doing and start working on it, they do not have a specific list of requisites or features that the product should have...  My idea was originally to try to implement and adapt Scrum in the following terms:  Create a product backlog ASAP. The product owner role would be filled by the owners of the company. Me and the other developer would be the Scrum Team. One of the developers would be the Scrum Master. We would have one sprint per week. Meetings every friday to review the last sprint and plan the next one. (Sprint Review, Retrospective and Planning) I do not see the necessity of a daily review meeting. I thought we could do sporadic meetings during sprints when one of the members feel necessary. Is it possible that this is going to work? What can I do to make it better? "
2026,How to get the team/end users to test features early in the test system?,"We're a 20 ppl company in supply chain management and I'm leading the IT department with 2 ppl (+ outsourced development company).  For new features, in my ideal, imaginative world, the users would test real cases on the test system. After they've verified that everything is developed according to their needs, the developers could deploy the feature to the live system.  In reality,    people are super busy and don't want/have time to spend on a test system.  People are reluctant to changes and improvement and adoption is growing only slowly/gradually.  Use cases, that the IT hasn't thought of, will be discovered after the deployment to the live systems and need to be fixed on urgent/priority bases.   (side note: We're a small company, the team doesn't understand much IT and many are rather junior, so the CEO requires the CTO to understand the business processes and come up with solutions. We've tried involving the team in planning and idea generation but the outcome was rather poor.  side note 2: We're currently shifting from a waterfall pm to some methods of agile/scrum, but it's not a clean switch, rather a process and partial improvements.)  For new features (before deploying to live) I've done:   Recorded screen videos, explaining/demoing the new feature Created user accounts in the test system for the key team members Shared requirements and documentation during the planning phase with key team members Created screen designs and wireframes to the team   but we keep on running into the issues mentioned about. Busy people, no contribution during the planning phase and fixes as well as change requests after deployment to live.  What can I do, to catch more use cases in the project planning phase? What can I do, to get people more involved early on in the development? "
2027,What can we do without a clear Product Owner or stakeholder on the client's side?,"In some of the projects my team works on, there are no stakeholders or it's unclear who the actual Product Owner is on the client's side. For example, we have to write user stories and acceptance criteria from the client's perspective. As developers, we are probably not good at this.  Being a developer and not a PM, it's sometimes difficult to bring all the parts of such a project together successfully. What should we do in such situations? How can we push the client to step in and take more interest in the agile process? "
2028,How do I group tasks in MS-Project?,"  This is my first ms-project. I want to plan the production and external operations of our plant. Production of reference #1 is something that will likely happen every 4 to 6 weeks (every time I receive a purchasing order). Is there any way I can group and save all these tasks together?  What I want is, instead of creating all tasks everytime I receive a PO, to select something like ""Production of reference #1"" and have all the tasks automatically created, and I will only need to decide when first task starts.  Is that possible? "
2029,Implementing Scrum when everyone is remote and part-time,"Before I begin, I want to mention that I have read through a lot of similar questions on this site about agile teams where a few members are part-time, but I haven't found anything about how to implement agile/scrum for a team where everyone is part-time.  I will start with some background on the project and the team. I am currently working on an online collectible card game similar to Magic the Gathering or Hearthstone. This is a new project and I will be managing a team of 4-6 developers. All of the developers either go to school or have full time jobs, but everyone has agreed to spend 10 hours a week working on this project. We all live in different states, so everyone will be working remotely.  I think an agile framework (particularly scrum) would be beneficial for this project, but I am looking for some advice on how to implement this. In my office we have pretty ""standard"" scrum practices with 2 weeks sprints, daily stand-ups, sprint planning, grooming, retro, etc. So I'm looking for some advice on how to implement scrum for this team (or some reasons why I shouldn't, if you think it's a bad idea).  Some particular questions I have are:   Should we try to setup times for when everyone should work, or should we allow everyone to pick their on schedules/work when they can? It seems like a daily stand-up doesn't make sense, especially since people may be working on different days and at different times. Does it make sense to  have maybe 3 stand-ups at specified times? Does it make sense to have a two-week sprint, or would a slightly longer sprint make more sense because of our reduced hours?   I want this project to be enjoyable for everyone, so I don't want to impose huge restrictions on everyone. But, at the same time, I want enough structure for us to be successful and on-task. Any suggestions or thoughts on how to implement scrum for this team would be greatly appreciated. "
2030,Acquiring knowledge story and splitting to tasks,"Lets say in a current project the team asked for training in a particular area to help them in the rest of the project and the product owner agreed and saw the value behind this training so it was put in the product backlog as a story ""As developers we want to have training in X to be able to do Y"". Now this story can fit in a single sprint and it is well detailed with acceptance test and every thing. Now in the sprint planning we will add this story and we need to split it to tasks with different training resources to take. Now all tasks must be done by all team members lets say one task is ""Take the course here (url) to learn X"" now when we try to put the effort hours of this task we make it normally as if it is one task then we multiply be all team members who are going to make it? as this task should be duplicated by all team members or what should be done? "
2031,Make duration dependant or update it based on a cell,"Starting with my first ms-project:  I want to plan the production of our machines at work. I only know the time it takes to produce one part (example: reference #1 takes 20 seconds). Now, I can calculate how many days it will take to produce 55.000 parts and input that in ""duration"" (which will be ~12 days). Can I upadte the duration manually depending on production? Something like this:  Starting date: 1/1/2010 Total parts needed: 55.000 Cycle time: 20'' Initial estimated production time: 12 days Finish date: 12/1/2010.   Delay of production due to mechanical problems -   Parts already produced after 3 days: 8000 (instead of ~12000)  Now, finish date should be moved one day because instead of 12.000 I have produced 8000.  I know I can do this using days, but the only information I have from machines is how many parts we have already produced.  Can I do the calculations in different cells and update duration accordingly?  What will happen if a resource had to be used on the 12-1-10 and instead, it's still not available due to the delay? Will it move it further?  Thank you very much and apologies for the noob questions. "
2032,"How to estimate and plan with a distributed, part-time team?","The situation: We are a small, fully-distributed software solutions provider. We serve multiple clients, and given our size that means every team member is on multiple, part-time billable teams. Usually 2 such teams per person, to minimize context switching. Everyone works a total of 30-40hrs a week, varying from week to week per available work and normal challenges. All teams estimate work using story points or hours, but definitions of these vary by client, as does the methodology (Kanban or Scrum, with varying iterations) and tooling (Jira, PT, and V1).   The problem: Taken together, team composition and execution is never consistent enough to support typical velocity or efficiency metrics, in turn making it a challenge to create trustworthy targets for clients (e.g., where we'll land in a backlog by given dates, prospective work estimates). We do our best to maintain team composition for a few months at a time for continuity's sake, but the aspects mentioned above obviously induce hard-to-predict outcomes and probably obscure other concerns.  So, how can we get better, preferably without drastically changing how we do business?  Approaches that have occurred to us so far have important gotchas:   We lock down our inputs (e.g., definition of story points), methodology, and tooling and iterate until we get as good as we can with them. The gotcha, as we see it: Client relationship risk, since most already have teams, methodologies, and tooling we coexist with. We come up with per-person, aggregate-able velocity metrics, cross-referenced by the kind of work, team size, etc. as we gain understanding over time. Gotcha: Based on our research this seems speculative and could take forever to lock down. We stabilize our teams to enable more traditional velocity metrics, estimation, and planning techniques. Gotcha: Business development and sustainment risk, since this will reduce our ability to mix and match teams in response to budget changes and new work.   Which of these sound most effective? Or a mix? Any other ideas? "
2033,How should you handle a risk when the only mitigation or contingency you can come up with is not on your hands?,"I had a risk for a software project that had to do with something I could not control. That was (really long delays on delivery of the hardware).  I work on a big company where IT has it's own budget and projects, and of course priorities. The tecnology area had to give us the stuff we needed to start with the Quality Control testing... and I knew they could very likely delay. And as I thought, they did. Even when this was talked with the IT area manager, he would do ""whatever he could"" but our project had other priority to him than what it had for us.  The problem was that the company works on such a way that on a given time the associated budget to my project would close and with it the whole project would go down. So time was a constraint. I tried talking with administration, but if I ask for extra time they need an estimated date to close the budget, and that had precedence on the raw IT material.  When the project was ongoing, every week, starting on the week before the expected delivey date, the IT area manager said ""It will very likely be next week"" and 5 months passed. On that time I also went to my boss to make the highly positioned guys on the company solve their issues and priorities, but they are also like ""racing against each other to get most of their projects done the best way possible"" and from software we have no leverage to exchange favors.  What ended happening was that the project went out of budget and we had to make another project, where the CIO of the (really big) company had to intercede.  What shoud I have done different? How can I save my project next time? and how should I otherwise be handling this risk? "
2034,How do Scrum teams manage their dependencies on other teams?,"In a Scrum team, what do you do with stories that require work to be done by another team?  The work required of the other team could be well defined and in parallel: ""We'll do this, and we want you to do that."" Or it could be that we're asking the other team to engage with us in the development process - discovering requirements and impacts, planning, validating, and then delivering.  The team being autonomous requires that the team is trusted to deliver its stories within the sprint. So the team sizes its stories to the size it can deliver within one sprint, and then takes responsibility for delivering it. But when the team depends on another team, the other team may not start work at the same time, and even if it works efficiently, its work may end up crossing the boundary of a single sprint. If they are not efficient, their work, even though appropriately sized for a sprint, may not be delivered within the time of one sprint, for example if they have competing priorities and other work in progress.  It seems that by depending on another team, our team has lost its autonomy, and can't be trusted to, or held responsible for, delivering the stories. Can it still be called a Scrum team then? But surely Scrum teams do depend on other parties all the time? How should the team manage these dependencies? "
2035,How to use Agile in a small web agency managing a lot of different projects?,"I'm faced with the duty of managing a small design and web agency's (3 full stack developers, 3 designers, 1 help desk, sales people...) technical department. The company is selling quite well (it has a lot of work) but is very badly organized right now. At present time they have a certain amount of projects that exceeded deadlines and don't have a clear picture of all tasks which need to be accomplished to close these projects and the time they will require: they have long lists of to-dos and client requests inside e-mails, which are approximately represented on a Google calendar (no tracking software except for that).  First thing I'm doing is trying to give an order to things by installing a software to be able to:  1) have a centralized repository for the tasks (with their execution time estimates) and possibility to assign them to people and for people to see their progress  2) allow people to update progress without requiring a person to manually move stuff on a calendar  I choose Atlassian Jira for the purpose because I am also using it for my freelance job. I'm absolutely no expert at it but I find it useful for keeping things sorted. I use a Scrum board for my tasks and plan things into Sprints.  Now my questions are:   does it make sense to have an agile approach and use tools like gantt charts at the same time (to have a longer period perspective)? If applicable how can it be achieved in Jira (any strongly suggested plugin)? do you have strong alternative software suggestion for the job?   This one is related to my other question here. "
2036,How is a smaller batch size in Kanban increasing performance?,"I have read that a small batch size is executed faster (obviously) than a bigger one.   I have also read that small batches are delivered faster, in relative terms, because they foster a more performant way of working in the team.  Now let's assume a team's throughput is 20 tasks a week. Does this all mean that 2 batches of 10 tasks are executed (as a whole) faster that 1 batch of 20 tasks?  If so, and given work is wip limited anyway, what are the underlying mechanisms that assure such an increased performance?  Am I missing something? "
2037,How to make realistic long term time estimations when adopting Agile methodology?,"I just started to manage the technical department of a small web design firm.  It's the first time I'm faced with such a job and I'm trying to figure out how to improve their project management practices, which now are reduced to keeping long lists of to-dos scattered around a number of internal and client e-mails.  I'm opting for gradually introducing an Agile approach but I have some doubts:   how do you estimate in advance the amount of new projects to be brought in in the long term when using an Agile methodology? how do you manage client's time promises/expectations with agile (especially if you need to do some bug fixing in the meantime)? does it make sense to have an agile approach and use tools like gantt charts at the same time to have a longer period perspective? do you have any strong suggestion on a software to adopt for managing the projects?  "
2038,Best Way to Manage Different Types of Work in one Board?,"Problem  My team consists of software developers and UX designers. Their workflow is different--UX has different steps than a pure development task has. What's the best way to manage this on one Kanban board?  bonus: what's the best way to manage this in Jira's Kanban?  Details  With our project, we have UX folks conducting stakeholder interviews, building wireframes, and getting approval. Their steps are something like:   Interview stakeholder Design wireframes Developer feedback Stakeholder Approval UI Design (colors, etc)   We also have developers with their own flow, like:   Ready for Work In Progress Code Review QA Product Owner Review Deploy   Some of the stories the designers work on feed directly into developer stories, so it would make sense to have a board combining all team members' steps. However, sometimes there's design work that won't directly lead to a dev story--basically, design stories will skip steps in the flow.  Thanks for your help! 🙇‍♂️ "
2039,In Jira is it possible to have a gantt chart (or calendar view or similar) derived from your agile board?,"I'm very new to Project Management, Agile and similar. I just started trying out Jira to manage the work of a small dev team which clearly needs to become organized (right now they are keeping track of their tasks/issues/bugs on paper and e-mails, no recorded per task time estimates).  As a starter I planned to put all the open issues in Jira and have the team members give their time estimates for each issue, so I can be able to have a clearer overall view of the work they are doing and what needs to be done, and prioritize it.  Is there a plugin/tool integrated with Jira which can represent on a calendar or a Gantt chart the time the team is busy and the time issues are expected to last based on a work time map (work hours per day, work days...), task assignees and time estimates?  Don't know if it makes sense but I imagine working on an agile board (say the backlog) prioritizing tasks and having the team assign time estimates, and then from that visualize in a graphical way a self-updating projection of the issues over time, based on new ""remaining time"" estimates given by the team members.  If not Jira is there any software you would suggest which does something similar to what I'm looking for and do you think this approach does make sense in the first place?  This question could relate to Is there are a resource handler or gantt chart creator tool for JIRA? "
2040,Long testing phase in Scrum,We are building quite a big and important feature in a Scrum Team. The PM wants to put this feature into a separate branch and not deploy it for a 1-2 months so the users can test it properly before release. It seems strangely waterfall for me.  What do you think? Is it ok in agile to do something like that? Or as a Scrum Master should I suggest splitting the feature into smaller pieces and release it frequently? 
2041,Why management is more concerned of JIRA hours than of following Scrum values?,"As in many other projects, we are also using JIRA to manage tasks and user stories, and Scrum as the Agile methodology. At the end of each day, the ScrumMaster provides the burndown chart to the PMO team.  However, the first set of questions that get raised during each weekly meeting with the PMO team, are:-   Why is the team not burning hours properly in JIRA - 5 hours per day? If each team member is burning hours (~ 5-6 hours per day) and logging them properly in JIRA, then why is the red line (of Remaining Values) in burndown chart not coming down as close to the Guideline? Who in the team is not logging hours? Why the team has to be reminded each day to log hours in JIRA?   Frankly speaking, the whole team is quite fed up with all these silly questions, and all of us wonder whether we are actually following Scrum values, or instead just maintaining JIRA to show PMO that we are all following Scrum and have a near-to-perfect burndown chart.  For me, I have always been wondering on three points:-   Why the management is more concerned of JIRA burndown chart than of following Scrum values in project development? Why do some members of the team don't like to log hours in JIRA diligently every day? Is there anything that the team can do to make this logging of hours (by each team member) a more easy process, so that the management does not bother us by asking such bad questions?   Can anyone of you please clarify my above-mentioned three doubts, so that we all can become a better Scrum team? Thank you all in advance, and I appreciate your time and suggestions to help me! "
2042,Change request affecting sales - what KPIs shall be used for tracking commercial perspective?,"In our organization we decide to develop new product after we have enough evidence and confidence this new product will bring X amount of revenue and gross profit.   Then in execution stage we face unexpected issues, which delay project for 3 additional months (product commercial launch is delayed). So project becomes late and in our lean boards we mark such project as being red.  Then Project Manager initiates change request during which new timelines are approved and project becomes green. So from project management framework all is good, project is green and PM is happy.  However CEO is not happy because Y amount of revenue is gone which was supposed to be collected during those 3 months. CEO does not want to accept project is green.  Shall we add additional KPI dimension in our lean board which could indicate how project is doing from commercial perspective? However this could be demotivating, because if commercial expectations are not met from the beginning of the project, that dimension will stay red for remaining of the project.   So how we should align properly CEO and PM perspectives? Shall we use additional KPI to track commercial goals (let's say kind of probability if project still on track with sales targets)? Shall this KPI be fixed throughout the project or it shall be adjusted as we go? "
2043,What indicates a good Project Manager?,"I get an understanding of what good code is and what skills will be needed on my project. I can assess a software developer's skills and knowledge by looking at his code and asking technical questions. That's not always easy, but at least I know the way.  I get an understanding of what makes a good Project Manager. But how do I tell a good PM from a wannabe on the interview? I can not usually look at his/her projects. I can come up with some general questions like ""What motivates people?"". But that's not enough I guess.  What do I do to indicate a good Project Manager? "
2044,How to split stories depending on APIs?,"Let's take the below user story as an example to understand the whole scenario better:  As a user, I should be able to contact a dealer to test-drive a car.   The scope of the story is that the user should be able to submit a test-drive request to a registered dealer. This can be done simply by filling a form which internally calls a REST API.  Now here are my questions:   Should I try splitting this story at all? Should I create a separate story for creating a REST API? As the creation of REST API follows the I.N.V.E.S.T. guideline. To me, it appears as a complete vertical slice. After splitting, how should the rest of the story look? Does it look independent? Would it make any difference if API is managed by the same or different team?  "
2045,What's the term for duration minus drag in CPA?,"In Critical Path Analysis, does there exist an established term for the duration of an activity left over after subtracting the drag? For example, if an activity takes 8 days and incurs 3 days of drag to the project, what would we call the remaining 5 days? "
2046,"Develop user stories in the previous sprint, if sprint commitments met?","If your developers have completed their Sprint commitments (QA is ongoing - and any issues found by them are fixed in the same Sprint), what are the possible issues with developers picking up items from the Product Backlog to start working on (assuming QA will not be able to test them in this sprint?)  Is it OK to do, or are there any pitfalls of this approach?  Note: We have a Scrum-based release every 6 months today, but plan to move to a Kanban based approach with continuous production-deployment in the future. "
2047,Create resource dependencies in MS project 2010,"e.g. I have a task that has to be fulfilled by two persons, but person B cannot start before person A has finished his part of the task. How do I scedule this in MS project 2010 without having to split the task in subtasks?  So, how do I enter resource dependencies/constraints? "
2048,Is an anti-Agile pattern to commit to the total hours of capacity available during iteration?,"Working on a project right now that is using Scrum, the company is doing the following:  1) Working out the availability of the team based on resources available and number of hours they can commit?  So if we have 5 resources available, the total number of hours they can all commit is added up.  2) Create a sprint backlog based on the total number of hours they can commit  3) Expect resources to deliver in that amount of time.  I have suggested this is anti scrum agile since the capacity is based on the average amount of time completed in x time. i.e. only because you have 37 hours worth of resources available does not mean you can get 37 hours worth of work done. Am I correct? "
2049,Running a sprint from Wednesday till Wednesday,"Currently we have three teams who start their two week sprint on Monday and end it on Friday. We have some team-members who have every Friday off. Planning sprint reviews on Thursdays or earlier is awkward, since the sprint is not yet done, or the whole Friday goes to ""waste"" on non functional tasks.   We want all the team members to be in the Sprint review and retrospective meetings and want to plan them at the end of the sprint. (We record Sprint review sessions for part-timers already)  Now we have figured out some possible solutions:   Ask team-members to take another day off. (Asking the developers to re-arange their free day is no short-term option, mainly because of complex planning of child-care.) Start Monday with sprint reviews and retrospective meetings. Afterwards (after lunch) start the Sprint planning session and hope to finish on Monday. This leads to a very long ""Talking"" day and this might bore some and will feel ineffective. Start the sprint on Wednesday and end on Tuesday.   As we are evaluating option 3, my question is: Are there teams who have experience with mid-week start and end of sprints?    What are the pro's and con's?  Maybe we overlooked an option? Any other suggestions to handle and plan sprints around availability of part-timers is welcome.   Update Found a blog post which supports that this might be a good idea, should have googled first before asking this question maybe. Still interested in your experience though.  Update 2 We have been running sprints from Wednesday till Wednesday now for a couple of iterations. I have the feeling everyone is pretty happy with it. The teams asked to plan all the meetings on Wednesday, our day looks like this:   9:15 Setup meeting room and screen-cast recorders, dial-in external stakeholders 9:30 Start review sessions per team Start evaluation meeting after a short break. Lunch Start planning sessions 17:00 Have a beer and snacks :)  "
2050,"What does ""N"" mean and how to count","I've been doing some research around managing our sprint cadence to align teams across time zones and came upon, ""N+1"" when describing a day of a sprint. I've not been able to find a definition of ""N"" and how the numbering convention works.   Example: If I wanted our Grooming session to be 2 days before and Sprint Planning to be 1 day before the beginning of a sprint, would I call this ""N-2"" and ""N-1"", respectively? And is the first day of the sprint ""N0"" or would ""N0"" be the grooming day?  What's a source for this convention (looking for best practice references)?

But I still have difficulties understanding how I exactly should use a ticket system, especially in the case of tickets for new features.  Let's assume the project is at a point, where we know what we have to do, but didn't start any coding. The first thing I want to do now is to bring all the requirements into the tickets system as tasks.  What would a Task-Ticket look like?  Is it a user-story like: As a guest I want to be able to register myself with the site or should I split them into tickets/tasks like Create a registration page/form, Send an email to to the user when registered. Is it a good practice to use user stories, or what is the best way to go?  If this information in relevant: We're going to use the github issue tracking system. "
2054,MS project. Shared tasks,"What if a task takes 10 days to complete, of which person A works 10 weeks and person B only helps the last 2 weeks?  I can choose that person B works 20%, but project plans other activities in person Bs spare time on all 10 weeks, it does not get that he only helps the last 2 weeks.  Do I need to create a new task for person B? For the last 2 weeks? Or is there a smart way to incorperate this in the already existing task? "
2055,Mid Sprint Demo,Mid sprint demo seems to be a popular practice among scrum teams but I struggle to see how it fits in with high performing Agile-Scrum teams.  Two sets of questions.     When should a formal midsprint demo be employed? What issues do you see resolved through this meeting?   and   What are the indicators that a team no longer needs a midsprint demo? What strategies do you use to steer your team and management away from using the practice?  
2056,How requirements are handled in TFS with Scrum template,"We have just started using TFS (Team Foundation Server) 2017. The team project we created uses the Scrum template. There are only Epics, Features and PBIs (Product Backlog Items) in this template. How to create requirements? We don't want to use a CMMI (Capability Maturity Model Integration) template.  So, the question is: how are requirements created/managed/manifested in the Scrum template? "
2057,Seeking professional advice on choosing/evaluating of an IT-contractor,"When choosing an IT-contractor I have only vague ideas on how I can discern the quality of an IT-firm. Below I gather some criteria I have thought about and would like to know if those points are essential and what else I might have to consider:  The cooperation should potentially include a software project (e.g. a Webshop, connected via back office to production states like availability of material) and long-term support including smaller adjustments of firm-intern, software-based processes.  The criteria of a qualified IT contractor might be:   contact and exchange with developers or team leader during development on a regular basis is available if mother tongue is not the same: minimum language requirement English if not locally available: find out how communication is established if contractor is an outsourcing and consulting company for software development: communication with team leader/ programmer must be possible contacting other customers of the IT firm to find out about there experience   What else is important to check or ask? What are (kind of) standard qualities an IT contractor should deliver? "

2059,Should defect criticality change based on user needs?,"Question  Is it correct to assume that the criticality of a defect can change along with the project's progress? If so, when is this acceptable?  Background  Criticality is one of the indexes we've used to use to define what can fit into a release or not. There were cases when the criticality has changed when users were not willing to add specific functionality because at that point in time the functionality was not priority. When the functionality became priority (and other critical defects were fixed), we have had a second round of criticality reviews moving entries into the queue for prioritization, since now they are considered critical.  My impression is that if this functionality is critical for business operation, then it should have the same level since day one. Once the defect is clear, the criticality isn't expected to change. On the other hand, if the defect wasn't clear enough, it's expected to have the criticality changed as the project gains clarity about it. "
2060,Who can change WIP limit in DoW when urgent work emerges?,"I had a following question in my PSK assessment.     When using Scrum with Kanban, who can change the WIP limits in the Definition of Workflow when a high priority work emerges from the Sprint?         Product Owner   Scrum Master   Development Team   No one, as WIP limit cannot be changed in the Sprint   No one, as 'High Priority' work is not a valid reason for changing the WIP during the Sprint.       Following one the reference topic for this question but unable to answer this question.   Limiting Work in Progress (WIP) in Scrum with Kanban - What / When / Who / How The Kanban Guide for Scrum Team - can help in understanding meaning of all terms used in this question like WIP limit, DoW (Definition of Workflow), Scrum Sprint with Kanban etc.   According to reference document: Development team can do it but when it comes to Sprint Backlog. There is no clear indicator this question belongs to Sprint Backlog only. And if this question covers entire Sprint then The Scrum Team decides what to do with high priority task.

2063,breaking down WBS in a project plan into activities,"I understand that a project plan (schedule) is much more than a WBS task list. It depends on how you organize your project schedule - may be into phases, may be modules. Phases might have overlapping WBS items, where as modules may not.  I also understand that the plan will contain more items than WBS. But I would hope that it is good to track your plan has accommodated all the WBS items in it as they are deliverables. I am using MS project and there is a WBS code column. Shall I be using it for cross reference? If so, is it ok to have that column blank for many activities that will not have a corresponding direct package reference. Or shall I use the code for the parent item that activity may fall under?  Thank you for clarifying. "

The Problem: During reading the brief, I have came across the following statement: ""Poor weather conditions often make the peak inaccessible from November to March each year.""   The Question: How would I adjust for the period between November to March? The statement above states ""often,"" which I believe implies that some days between November to March will be accessible. However, how would I go about this? Do I simply assume the number of days which will be available for work by calculating number of days from November to March and finding the average?   Thanks. "
2066,"""Dead horse"" topics banned at sprint retrospectives, is this good practice - why or why not?","I'm asking as a member of an Agile (Scrum) team, not as the PM/PO/Scrum Master.  On this project there are a handful of well-known impediments / problems / things that didn't go well, which are a recurring theme in every Sprint.  We are developing software but I didn't want to go into all the details, so, an anonymous-ish example from a house renovation project could be:     Client can't make a decision what layout they want for the kitchen   until they receive the samples from the 3rd party supplier, but the   3rd party supplier keeps delaying it for unknown [to us] reasons. (They can't get a different supplier because of ""whatever reasons"") So   we can't start building the cabinets because we don't have the   layout.   That's just a made up example but it's the sort of 'impediment' I mean.  I see them in my head as ""dead horse"" topics (as in 'beating a dead horse'). Although we have tried to solve or mitigate them, they aren't really under our control.  It's accepted by the team that we can't resolve them at this point, but they are still hurting our productivity in each Sprint. (e.g. couldn't make any progress on building the cabinets, as the client still hasn't been able to specify what layout they want. We wasted a lot of time mocking up design ideas without any real idea what they wanted, but they rejected the designs.).  So now in each Retro (we have 2-week sprints, so every 2 weeks) we go through what went well, what could have been better, etc. People were calling out these ""dead horse"" topics in each and every Retro as they were genuine impediments or things that didn't go well. Generally met with a collective eye roll or groan like an unspoken ""yeah, that's pretty much the main thing thats gone wrong and it's quite fundamental but what can you do!""  As a result ""dead horse"" topics have now been ruled out from discussion in retros, and we aren't allowed to bring up those subjects (e.g. no layout requirements due to the 3rd party dragging their feet) as part of ""what went badly"" discussions. But I feel like it's a bit of an 'elephant in the room' - (sorry for all the animal metaphors!)  Questions,  Is this a standard or good practice in facilitating a retro to 'censor' known issues like this? So that they don't just keep coming up over and over when no one can do anything about them?  If this isn't the standard approach, how should the subject of ""known 'dead horse' issues that were a problem but we know we can't resolve"" be addressed? "
2067,assigning multiple resources to a single task in MS project - is that right?,"I have seen some project plans where a task that spans 80 hours has two resources assigned to it, one at 100% and the other at 50%.

What will be an example legitimate scenario for doing the same? or is the PM just lazy to expand this. "

2069,How to effectively combine different (project and non-project) activities in Kanban?,"In our company, we're currently trying to get started with Kanban. When discussing about how to handle the different work items / user stories / tasks, this question came up:     How do you effectively handle different activities in Kanban?   For example, I don't have to work for only one project. There are also other tasks I have to do (participating in special work-group meetings, client training some days, etc.). All members of our team are still involved in other activities that are completely independent of the actual project we're working on.  As Kanban is an evolutionary approach, we think there should be a ""smooth"" migration, meaning that we don't want to force all the team members to stop participating in other working groups.  Our possible approaches are:   Include other activities as tasks on the Kanban board.  Problem: most of the other activities, like training or meetings, are fixed in time. When other work isn't finished, starting those ""non-project"" activities would break the Kanban Limit, but allowing this, would not require us to include them in our Kanban process. Ignore non-project activities in the Kanban process.  Hopefully there's a better approach. Create a second board for those other activities.  Problem: How do you control the WIP-limits?   How can we handle this these different activities with Kanban? "

2071,Scrum team is dependent on other team's work,"I'm working in a big project, where we're creating a standard software A for several customers and in parallel extending that software for one customer (software B). There are several Scrum teams. The teams, which work on A, are geographically and contractually separated from B teams.  Often we need to have something fixed or changed in A to complete our user stories in B. That causes a lot of friction, because we often cannot complete our planned tasks. We try to analyse user stories to avoid in-sprint dependencies on A, but when we discover a bug in A, we have to wait for the next sprint to get a fix.  Another problem is that we had to chose between long implementation cycles (sprint of A + sprint of B) or integrating mid-sprint deliverables with incomplete or buggy features. So far we've chosen to use mid-sprint deliverables, because we can continue our tasks faster.  Now we're rethinking our approach: How should we setup Scrum in teams, which depend on some other team's work? How can we reduce canceled tasks in mid-sprint? "
2072,Microsoft Project: Cannot level resources assigned to summary tasks,"I have run into unexpected behavior in Microsoft Project 2013. To reproduce, create the tasks seen in the screenshot:    Where Requirements has a maximum unit of 100%.   Notice that when you ""Level All"" Project will complain ""Requirements"" is over-allocated even though it can schedule Summary1 and Summary2 as non-overlapping. Removing predecessors from Task3 causes the error to go away but I don't see why it should make a difference.   Is this a bug?

Is there a way to constrain a resource in MS Project to where they are only expected to work 80% of the time on the project, and also no more than 50% on a given task in a given day? For example, in a 10-hour day, a resource can work on Task1 for 5 hours and then Task2 for three hours before starting the next day to work on Task1 again for 5 hours and then Task2 again.  Is this something that is possible? And if so, where would I look to configure such a rule? Would this be the difference in configuring the units to 80% on a specific resource, and then altering the units of the resource on the specific tasks to 50%?  Many thanks in advance for any input.

But I was asked if I'd like a roll at a client site to work as a Commercial Manager (Program Manager), but I really like what I'm doing now as it aligns with what I'm studying, but then again will the other path be a better option?, I really am interested in the high level area of the business and don't wan to get back to all the deep technical stuff even though i was really good at it. I'm not sure what to say, I can see that I like my new role as part of the PMO so much!, I would hate to go to the other role and regret it, but is the other role a better opera unity for career growth, I'm not even sure what Program Managers do really. What's your idea?, can someone gimme any guidance, pointers? "
2075,Change from software developer to scrum master?,"I have been a .NET software developer for the last 5 years, at the moment dealing with azure cloud technologies. I am certified scrum master and soon to be certified scrum professional. I have the opportunity to become a scrum master for my team. I haven't been a full time scrum master however I have been supporting the scrum masters in various teams whenever needed (holidays, sick days etc). Am I right to  think that once I progress(?) to a SM role, I'll have to quit my developer's tasks (as we all know, being a dev and a SM is a highly hoped but infeasible plan) and thus stop keeping up with latest technologies, and eventually leaving behind me the dev career?  I want to go to higher management sooner rather than later (I'm nearly 30), but what if I don't like it and decide to go back, and then it's too late?  Please don't start enumerating the ""scrum master is not a project manager, is barely a manager"" story, I'm very well aware of what the role includes.  To put this in different words: Is SM a stepping stone to higher management, or once you're a SM, you're stack there without being a PM (or PO), but also with degraded dev skills? "
2076,How to identify tasks that should have started (based on completed prerequisites),"I have a MS Project plan that orchestrates multiple hundred activities over a couple of hours (the tasks also have dependencies) and would like to drive the execution based on the plan.  During the orchestration of the plan, I could be faced with a situation in which someone would report that task 123 has been completed. Afterwards, another colleague might inform me that task 234 has been completed. Based on the completion of the two tasks, task 345 could now start.  Without manually checking the dependency column, how do I know that task 345 can start? Put differently: How do I create a list of all tasks that could start (such as task 345) because their prerequisites are fulfilled but that are not yet started? "
2077,Can somebody be his/her own Scrum Master in a programming company?,"If a programmer in a small company wants to be his own Scrum Master, and Scrum teams are supposed to be self-organizing, does that mean no one can manage him? If that's true, then:   How can he manage himself? How can he plan his time for managing and plan for his works? How can Project Managers get reports from him? Is it possible to grant responsibilities to him? Which work items should he define for himself every day?  "
2078,Mixing organizational and Scrum roles,"Within a quite young and fresh Startup, I'm currently holding the role of a Scrum Master, as well as a developer. My tasks are split up 50/50 between those roles. The 1.5 years before that, I was working as a full-time (FTE) Scrum Master, so this role isn't completely new to me.  The Team consists of 2 full-time developers, 1 freelance developer, 1 very gifted intern for QA &amp; prototyping, a PO and me. So in total we have around 3.5 FTE developers, 1 FTE for PO and 0.5 FTE for Scrum Master.  For the Product Owner (PO), it's his first time as this role, first time within a software company and also first time working in a software / Scrum / Agile project. He's doing very well and learning quite fast. He still got some rough edges, but I'm satisfied with his personal progress so far.  Among the 2 full-time developers, there's that one guy who's my direct supervisor + is holding shares in the company. That person does have some background of Scrum, but in my opinion a quite dirty and ineffective one. Let's just call him Mike.  In order to get all Team members thinking about the Scrum process, I asked everyone in the beginning about his role within the Team. Mike gave me the answer that he's just a developer. Period.  Right now, I'm facing the difficulty that Mike is pushing and enforcing things by his organizational role. I as a Scrum Master massively dislike this situation, as it's doing harm to the process and is also slowing us down. By pushing and enforcing I mean e.g.   secretly bringing in ungroomed and unestimated User Stories from the Product Backlog into an active Sprint Backlog, with afterwards arguing in favor of it based on his organizational role. I spoke to him about this situation in private. He told me that he knew it's wrong but needed / wanted to have that User Stories in the current Sprint.  assigning User Stories of the Sprint Backlog to developers, rather than let them take the User Stories themselves constantly trying to push in more work and tasks, which only increases our Work in Progress   My questions are now   I'm used to fighting with the PO concerning upcoming Sprint Backlogs, but I never had a situation without total backing of the Development Team. How do I gain that backing in such a situation? How do I solve the mixture of organizational and Scrum roles? Have I already been burned as Scrum Master for that Team?  "
2079,What is smaller than a user story but bigger than a task?,"We have a ""heavy"" story that cannot be decomposed into smaller stories. It will span several sprints.  We can decompose the story into tasks all right, but tasks seem to be abstractions that are only a few hours long.  What we need is an abstraction that will drive each sprint - with a well defined deliverable (similar to a story, but internal), points estimation etc. What is smaller than a story, but bigger than a task? How is something like this usually handled? "
2080,Are SCRUM iterations meaningful?,"Sitrep: I have finished a story that I could not complete within iteration while it was planned to be completed. It's necessary to get this done and ASAP since it's a prerequisite for other stories and tasks, so I have just finished it several days later after iteration ended.  Formally, the story should be thrown into backlog and revisited, but why really? There would be no point to it given the practicalities: it had to be completed anyway, reviewing it again would bring no new insights, etc.  So the question is are there any practical benefits to using iterations as such and not just measuring velocity using story points? "
2081,"In Scrum, what is a good work area layout to foster swarming and other collaborative practices?","We changed our work area layout from a cube farm to what is variously known as a bullpen or a fishbowl style open layout. We are finding this is more helpful for team collaboration and provides an area in the middle for the daily scrum stand-up. And we do the Sprint Planning in the conference table in the middle, instead of booking a conference room, which we used to do earlier. The downside is that there is some loss of privacy. What is a good work area layout for scrum teams? And if it is an open layout, is there some way to mitigate the loss of privacy? "
2082,How can developers and testers agree on story point estimates?,"Previously we used duration for each story, but in our current sprint we are using story points (effort) keeping test team effort separate from the development team effort. Story points are based on complexity, effort, and doubt. These three points will differ for a developer/programmer than with someone creating manual tests or someone creating automated tests. How can all of these different factors be combined to created an overall story point estimate?  According to Scrum these should be combined (as it's a team effort), but how is this done? Is it just combining the developers' and testers' efforts, or do testers and developers have to estimate the combined effort? If the latter, are there guidelines for this to work effectively? "
2083,How to handle multiple suppliers in a PRINCE2 project?,"Let's say you have two suppliers, one for software development and one for graphics design. It seems odd to have the Senior Supplier role filled by any one supplier.   When you have multiple suppliers from different organisations, who should be in the Senior Supplier role on the Project Board? I would say someone from MY organisation, but such a structure seems like it's overhead.  What is the best approach to structuring a Project Board with multiple suppliers? "
2084,"Are there alternatives to ""resource"" for describing tech staff on projects?","I am a full-time developer; almost everywhere in project management we are listed as resources. Are there better terms to use other than resource?  I feel term resource has a connotation of being temporal: something used and thrown away once tasks are complete, etc. Maybe I am wrong, but it bothers me to be described that way. Are there other ways of referring to tech staff in project management? "
2085,What's the best approach to structure a project plan for a JSF project?,"We're a Software Development Company that's about to start working on a JSF (JavaServer Faces) project with a Hibernate persistence layer. I'm managing the project, and we have 2 developers on the team that were recently introduced to JSF. What's the best approach to structure the project plan?   Some issues on my mind:   Breakdown of tasks. Should developers work on different parts of the same module or should each one handle his own module?   Please add/suggest any other issues you think I should take into consideration. "
2086,How can I plan resources for maintenance after project?,"My managers are asking, before green-lighting a new project, how much people (resources) will it take after the project is done, to maintain it. Ie: fix bugs, deploy new features on demand, adapt to changing business processes, etc.?  What I am able to evaluate (based on history of other projects) is avg. number of bugs happening in production. But I don't see how I can evaluate processes changes, new management requests, new business opportunities.  What scrum metrics can I use to calculate this. Or is there any rule-of-thumbs I can rely on? "
2087,Who performs a release and how is it estimated?,"I have just joined and become the Scrum Master for a team at a company. I came in on the last three days of one of its many sprints.  On the last day of the Sprint, they released the increment.  This took about five or six hours, coming across issues with the network, third-parties etc. to make it a lengthy process.  My question is, who performs the release? How is this normally estimated? Is there a separate task for it? What happens if it goes so slowly that it overlaps into the next Sprint?   Thanks everyone! "
2088,Why didn't we need a prototype for some of the projects?,"   This is not about why do we need a prototype. Or the opposite of Why don't we need a prototype. It's about why some of the projects that we did without a prototype/not even thinking about one...   Most of our projects (small scale IT/software development), did not require a prototype. Some were RAD, some were developed using typical waterfall methodology or agile. For major projects prototypes were required. During a recent  project meeting, I was challenged to explain why prototypes were required on some projects and not on others. "". . .[h]ow do you  determine that you don't need a prototype?""   For each of those projects, what made us to not to create a prototype..? I am cracking my head... I could only think of following reasons (and I am not fully convinced):   Client has no time for prototyping and needs accelerated development Requirements and process to be improved are Crystal clear Smalle scale projects that can be written within a day to 7 days or with max 2 weeks Some enhancements or modifications to an existing system    All of the above has to follow the basic project life cycle. Also for e.g. does a migration project (say from Java to C#) better off with a prototype of without (I am not asking specifically for migrations, but it could be one of the situations in real life)? "
2089,How can I update a MS Project plan to show schedule slippage?,"Once I've set up my baseline, I like to use the Tracking view to see schedule slippage (ie: is a project going to be ""late""?). The problem occurs when I'm updating the % Complete, but a task that was supposed to be complete (or in progress) has not been started yet, so I leave it at 0% Complete. Project doesn't update the tracking Gantt, so you can't see that the project is ""slipping"".  How do you handle this?  My ""Hack"" Workaround  In my Options > Calculation I generally have the following set:   Move end of completed parts after status date back to status date. Move start of remaining parts back to status date. Move start of remaining parts before status date forward to status date. Edits to total task % complete will be spread to the status date.   For tasks that are complete or partially complete, this works great - just fill in the % Complete value, and things jump around, showing you if you're ahead or behind schedule for the remaining tasks.  However, if a task that was supposed to start before the current status date has not even started, I don't know how to make Project push that task forward to the current status date. The only workaround I've found is to assign it a small % complete, such as 1%. Then it moves the remaining part of the task forward to the status date. But this seems kind of hackish to me.  How can I get MS Project 2003 to show schedule slippage on unstarted tasks? Is there a setting / Tool or other feature I need to be using?  Example  Set up a new Project with the following tasks: 1. Task 1 (1d) starts on Monday 2. Task 2 (2d, dependent on 1) starts on Tuesday 3. Task 3 (1d, dependent on 2) starts on Thursday 4. Task 4 (0h, milestone, dependent on 3) Finishes on Friday.  Now, let's set the Status Date to Thursday - we're updating the project plan.  In Scenario 1, Task 1 is 100% complete, but task 2 for some reason is only 50% complete. If we fill that information in, Project will split task 2, and move the second part of the split (the remaining 50%) to start on Thursday. As a result, Thursday's task moves to Friday, and our Friday milestone moves to Monday and we can clearly see the project completion will be late by a day (1 day's slippage).  In Scenario 2, Task 1 is still 100% compete, but task 2 hasn't been started yet (0%). If we fill in the 100% complete for Task 1, and leave everything else at 0%, Project does NOT move Task 2 to Thursday, and as a result there doesn't appear to be any slippage, so at a glance we might conclude the project is still on-time. As a workaround, if I put a 1% in for Task 2, then it does go ahead and splits the task, but that's just a hack to get it to update the timeline, and can't be the only way to do things. At least I hope not. Hence this SE question! "
2090,Is it better to revitalise or restart a project that has been modified?,"A classic scenario: Revamp a website with a new color scheme and a left navigation bar.  After the team has started working on it for a while, upper management decides to go with a completely different color scheme and a 3-panel navigational/highlight design.  In terms of team morale, what is better/worse?    Should we call it quits and restart?    Cancel the first project and start a new project. New code name, clear out the old schedules and tickets. Possibly shuffle the teams a bit. Maybe have a quick post-mortem and launch party. My concern here is that the team may feel that it wasted its time and never completed the project.  Or should we just treat it as a change request, and do as little change as possible?   Pretend it's the same project, tweak the schedule slightly as needed and have a quick meeting to inform everybody about the changes. My concern here is that the project seems to drag on forever, with the fear that another major redesign may yet ambush us again.    Or maybe there are other options I have not thought of. "
2091,What should be asked in 360 feedback from Scrum Team?,"We have a Scrum Team with the following roles: developer, tester and product owner.  We want to create a 360 peer feedback form and need a set question-answer format for that. What could be the best set of questions and response choices for this?  A few example questions:   Is person punctual in Scrum meetings? Does he/she participate well in Scrum meetings e.g. share new ideas? Is he/she helpful?   "
2092,Slack value in a project network diagram?,"Can you please tell me how can I use the slack value in my network diagram to readjust it(if it is applicable)? Using the following table, I have calculated the slack value and drawn a network diagram.   Finding Slack Value:   A-&gt;B-&gt;E-&gt;F = 14 weeks is the critical path A-&gt;B-&gt;D-&gt;F = 10 weeks A-&gt;C-&gt;E-&gt;F = 12 weeks   I want to keep the original project duration intact(therefore, I am not going to change the number of weeks used in the critical path). But I want to reduce the number of weeks used in non critical paths. Can I do that by using the slack values(or another method)? "
2093,"Small story got bigger, what to do with the big bit?","Under Scrum, we have a story which was estimated to be quite short. Once the story was picked up by a developer, it turned out that a significant amount of technical preparation is required, and this is dragging hugely.  The business has agreed that the preparation work can be left as it is once we reach the end of the sprint, so that the developer can continue to pick up other (more important) work - meaning that the story cannot be done. This is an explicit agreement with the business that the current story will be picked up later (after a particular deadline has passed.)  Should this problematic story be moved to Done, marked as cancelled and then resurrected in a later sprint or should we simply mark it as blocked and leave it where it is until some (possibly much) later sprint has capacity to pick it up?  A third option is that we dissect the story into two: one for the preparation work and one for the actual work. But with that the question remains: What should be done with the actual story, given agile guidelines? "
2094,What are the steps for an agile coach when he starts with a new team?,"As an agile coach, what are first steps that you take when going to a company to ensure they adopt agile? Let's assume that this company has only heard of agile, they are working on a very traditional waterfall method, and have a large team of 10 devs, 5 qa, 1 pm. For example, do you start with a presentation and team formation? Or do you sit back doing some due diligence on how the company works? "
2095,PMP experience requirement,"PMP experience requirement-I'm scrounging for hours! 1. On a parenting leave of absence from the workforce I started up a small business, went on training courses, incorporated the business, ran it for a few years and then closed the business to return to the full time workforce. Would this count as ""leading and directing""? Being self-employed at the time, could I vouch for myself if audited? 2. I did a project management course- the whole course was on writing a project proposal (which I did). Would this count as ""leading and directing?"" Thanks! "
2096,Logical Loop: PMBOK 5th Ed,"I am hoping someone can clear up my misunderstanding of the sequence for developing a project plan according to PMBOK 5th Ed.  We see that creating a project plan inputs into it's subsidiary plans (Scope, Cost, etc.), however according to the book the subsidiary plans are also inputs to the Create Project Plan step.  I understand that this is legitimate if you are doing an iterative type project, but a conventional, one step water-fall approach you cannot have one without the other according to the guide.   What would come first then?  The subsidiary plans or the over all project plan?  I know this is a very picky question, however it does seem there is a type of logical loop in the PMBOK guide.  I am asking for the following reasons: 1: If this questions is asked in the CAPM/PMP test. 2: For my own edification.  Thank you "
2097,project work with difficult client,"My company takes in projects from a variety of clients in the region I am in.  One of these clients is a firm that kind of competes with us on some things, but in other ways we cooperate.  The relationship there is complex.  Anyway, I am managing a project where our development group configures and dumps a bunch of stuff onto their server for them.  It's actually pretty drab work.  It should also be noted that there is a pretty tight timeline on this particular project.  We have about 2 weeks from getting the project to deployment.    Before we get the project, I collect the requirements, document the scope in a statement of work, and get it signed by all involved.  A week goes by and we start executing the project according to the agreed upon scope.  So now we have one week left.  We have a meeting this morning and lo-and-behold - he starts trying to add a bunch of features.    What else can I do to ensure that we get as much of the requirements as possible up front?  My business unit really isn't in a position to reject work; we could definitely use the business.  I should also add that the other guy is pretty new to the job, and comes across as such.  He also might have a small-man problem, in that he might be trying to show us all that he's large and in-charge of the project (although this is immaterial to the question).    So here's the question: How do you handle people who obliviously try to add and change scope at the worst possible time in the project life cycle?  "
2098,New Project Management Duties,"From being a Tester to a Developer then to a service support engineer, I am now responsible for program coordination and resource management (Yes it is a big shift), along with some Project management tasks, which is the long term goal for all this, It seems that my mindset has to be completely different to how I go about doing my job than I would previously do.  Im still on my part-time MBA, which I started a year ago, although my time has become even limited than it was before, there's just not enough time for anything as there's so much to do.  Has anyone here ever switched from an Engineering role to PM?, if so how did you find it and how long did it take for you to get things under control?, I also find that you have to be more punctual than usual, it's really changing the way I think about most things in life, at a more higher level top general view with no detail..  Is it just me? "
2099,Change Request to change scope,"We're running a project and we come to conclusion that the approach used in the project to handle the business issue is not performing as expected. We're changing the scope of the project to meet the business requirements. Should a change request be raised? Who should write it, if needed? "
2100,What are the benefits of PRINCE2 Agile?,I have recently heard about a new methodology that mixes PRINCE2 and Agile called PRINCE2 Agile. I was wondering what could be the benefits and reasoning behind this?   As I understand PRINCE2 is a greatly traditional approach while Agile is quite the opposite – can two opponents actually make a great match? 
2101,How do project management maturity levels relate to the introduction of portfolio management?,"I am researching project and portfolio management. I want to use the P3M3 self-assessment in my work and wonder if there any limitations regarding project management maturity level on using portfolio management?   For example, should a company not use portfolio management until it gets level 3 of project management maturity? Or can each company establish portfolio management independently of its project management maturity level? "
2102,Lacking a dedicated Product Owner,"We have a Super Product Owner, who cannot possibly be involved in writing or refining every story - they simply set the overall priority on the board.  We have Subject Matter Experts, whose day job is to be involved with work completely unrelated to our team and, mostly, unrelated to the technology we are building. They have knowledge which can be used to drive individual stories but otherwise have a light touch.  We have Business Analysts who are few and far between and, due to pressures outside of our team, cannot be as dedicated to our team to be ideal.  We also have the DevOps team.  From the left, our scrum board currently includes the following columns:  [New] For drafting stories (added to by the SPO, BAs and SMEs) [Backlog] For refining and 3-Amigo'ing stories [To Do] As usual (the board is normal from here...)  The problem is that we do not have a definitive Product Owner; The SMEs will either write the stories or provide input from the business to a story. The SPO might right a story. However, neither of those has the time or the knowledge (and certain not the business priority) to be the product owner for any given story.  What this means, is that a story will get to a certain level of detail and moved from the [New] column into the [Backlog] column. We, as the DevOps team, are then expected to take ownership of each and every story, push for the 3 Amigos and do the legwork to find out who is requesting the work, etc.  One acceptance made is that the author of the story is putting their name on it (something which, believe it or not, Service Now doesn't enforce) and so we have someone to go to (often, not always) to question. If not, we go to the Super Product Owner.  Direct question for SO: How can this be improved and is it acceptable to 'Agile' in general? Is there a particular element which could be tweaked, given the constraints outlined above, which would allow us to name a definite PO more often?  Less direct question: Have you ever worked in this sort of setup and how did you handle it? Is there a way to make it work when the 'PO' is a disparate group, rather than any single person? "
2103,Can our company avoid losses due to sunk cost negotiation?,"I feel my company is losing a lot of money on each project iteration because of a negotiation technique employed by our business partners(customers). I want to find out the name of this technique and references so that I can point my colleagues to it because they don't get the point or don't care right now, which I believe is a terrible mistake.  Here is how it goes every time:   Customer asks us to develop feature X,Y,Z for our next project iteration software We agree on timeline of the project (releases of each feature, bugfixing, test periods) They slow down sales process as much as possible They require to keep the schedule and they want to receive each release. So we release the features as they are being developed (e.g. continuous delivery). To make sure they don't deploy our project, we give them expiring ""demo"" licenses. (I think we should not release anything at this point) Project is 75% done - still no sales agreement, but we are converging on a somewhat reasonable price. Twist: They say: maybe feature X,Y,Z is not really needed project is going to be cancelled. Our sales team contacts them with a severly discounted price to make sure that we are at least not in the red for this project. They negotiate the price even lower knowing full well that we are running after our lost investment. We agree on a price that is ridiculously low and they accept the project with features X,Y,Z.   I think at point 4 we seriously decrease our negotiating power because Customer knows well that we have serious investment in the project and we have to get an agreement. So they know our company will not decline their very low offer because we want to keep the project green at least.  I suggest that our company should not provide proof that we have sunk cost(as in sunk cost fallacy) in the project. So I think we should not release anything until the sales process is complete. (even if we keep developing behind the scenes to keep our dev resource allocation even.)  Questions:   Is our company really making a mistake and losing money here? Is this issue documented in the literature as a known bad practice so that I can point my colleagues to it? Does this have a name? (""proof of sunk cost"" maybe?) If known bad practice, what are our best steps to mitigate this?   note: every time I point out to my colleagues that we are losing negotiating power, they seem confused and say: ""But we are providing demo licenses, so they cannot deploy it."", which is beside the point. My point is that Customer should not have the knowledge that we have sunk cost. "
2104,Communicating requirements to offshore teams,"Just to give a context, there is an offshore team in India for a client in San Francisco. The offshore team is about 9 developers and 4 QA, with one project manager. I am doing onsite coordination for this team from the client location. Every sprint (2 weeks iteration) I go after the stories beforehand, understand it and give an overview during their story time. I also clarify the corner cases for them making sure every piece of requirement is clear and the scope is also well defined. Inspite of this, there are instances of surprises that come-up in the requirement as well as scope (my bad, agreed!).  We have started sending mock-ups for every UI story too. But instead the team there does not put any effort to brainstorm and understand the requirement upfront, but they start doing right away without proper understanding.   At the end of sprint (1/2 days before) they ask same questions that were clarified through the mock-up and those which were clarified during story time and the subsequent mails. Finally if I say yes this is to be done etc., they say this was not clarified before. (How do I know this question will pop-up to them?)  They obviously fail to deliver sprint after sprint. The manager there does not even understand a piece of development he being a QA and has zero control of the project (unfortunately promoted as a manager of the same team, when he had tried to resign - which often happens in Indian services company). And this manager not even tries to understand that the dev or QA did not do adequate planning, brainstorming nor do their extra or little effort to understand a feature and its consequences, and directly jumps to the conclusion that the requirements are not clear. Manager also does not spend adequate time with the team and he spends time elsewhere going out! (weird, hearsay!)   There is also a severe dearth of technical and product knowledge of dev and QA respectively, and no steps are being made to improve this. In the first week I hear that they are all clear, the second week things change drastically - my guess is that is when they start to work. Every sprint it becomes worse and only harsh comments and emails are being exchanged. 'Requirements not clear' seem to be the easy way out, and Team there got habituated to saying this to compensate their incapability.   I am unable to explain this as they form a group in making this easy decision, and bounce with multiple rude emails. What would you do to get these things right? How much of adequate is adequate clarity in requirement? I am really unsure of this. (The teams in SFO are rather pretty clear with the even lesser amount of explanation of requirement.) How can I set this right? Is my guess about the offshore team right? (Excuse me for being too verbose!) "
2105,"Team added ""Daily Scrum"" as a task in Jira. How do I get rid of this?","So I am just joining a new team. This team is using ""Daily Scrum"" as a task because according to them it is a ""task"".   Obviously I want to help them understand that it is not a task, just like logging in to your computer isn't a task. The only question I anticipate is, ""then how do we note the time spent in these activities"". As of now, I have only one suggestion. ""Consider these activities as part of the actual task itself"". For example, a bug fix requires planning, testing etc. Those should be included in the estimate, not considered as separate activities.   Now, two questions. First, is my approach to this possible question correct? Can I help the team understand this better?  Second, can I just stop the team from counting hours spent in these activities? I can just track them myself, on my side, to see if we are improving. Obviously, then I will have to reduce the efforts per day to account for the change in estimation. E.g. going from 8 hours per day to 6 hours per day, plus 2 hours for other essential activity. Will this be a better approach than just increasing estimates for actual tasks?    There are a lot of other bureaucratic processes here in place. It is not Scrum but rather Scrumbut. :( I am planning to take up the task to fix this. That's why the question. And yes, they have a bloody task called ""Communication strategy"" where they log hours for internal team discussion. I have been told it is because current PM wanted to track that. I don't care if they spend 3 hours discussing a solution instead of spending 6 hours in analysis. That's why I want to find the best way to get the team to start focusing on actual deliverable piece of work, and not on this.  "
2106,Project authority level,"There are 2 major systems operated in an organization (an ERP and another major operational application) which are handled by 2 project managers. Data flows from the operational application to ERP. A new major request comes from client end to the project manager who manages the operational application to develop a module which will require an integration to transfer data from the operational application to ERP and once data is passed, there are certain changes that will need to be modifed from ERP end in order to complete the requirement.   My question is, should both project managers be responsible / accountable for the entire project where the operational application project manager handles until the completion of data transferring from operational application to ERP and the ERP project manager has to take care of the ERP end modification? Or else, should the operational application project manager be solely responsible for the entire project? And if it's the first scenario where both project managers are responsible, should the client be informed about the project authority level or does it need to be handled internally?   Extremely sorry if the question is too long or complex "
2107,Where is the value in walking the board with a detailed task board?,"My team keeps a detailed record of in progress and blocked items on the team task board (format: To Do, In Progress, Done).  The board is so detailed that meetings have turned into walking the board status updates that are simply read right off the board.  There is value in coming together to discuss after scrum items, particularly because half the team is remote.  Where are the impediments?  (Marked on the board)  What are you working on?  (Marked on the board)  What did you do yesterday? (Board updated to reflect any changes/completions)   The team does not see the value in having a scrum meeting.  I've considered:   Get rid of daily scrum as it's been replaced with these async updates?  Management won't like that.   Changing the format to ask different questions.  What else is valuable?   How can we fix this?   "
2108,Managing huge experimental decision by a developer,"The project which I'm working on was over, but I would like to reflect on managing a huge experimental decision made by one developer during development. This is what happened:  A developer strongly felt that something is not right with the current design of the project. Due to insufficient knowledge, he was unable to express out what is wrong. As we have deadlines, we cannot wait, nor work with him on his research as he cannot convince us what's wrong.   To be constructive, he told us to move on while he conducted his research and experimented huge redesigning works on his branch of the SVN.  A couple of weeks later, he presented to us a working, hugely redesigned (and refactored) project which he's confident of and explained to us everything. We were convinced.  However, as we were changing and adding features based on the old design, it was as good as we were working on 2 separate projects and SVN merging became impossible due to the large difference. We had 2 options then.   To work on our copy, which we would have to redesign all our features to the new standard as well as identifying all refactored stuffs. To work on his copy, which we would have to first identify changed features and implement back correctly in his design, followed by the new features.   We chose the first option, as the second option would still have to deal with lots of redesigning due to the changed features using obsolete classes and the likes.  Lots of time was spent, and everything felt like double (or perhaps triple) effort. Though it was worth it (we did meet the deadline through more effort), question is, given the circumstances, is there any methodology we overlooked that could have more properly handled such scenario? Or was what we were doing the correct decision and that this is actually a normal / common thing in development?  Note that he wasn't that confident of what he was doing either, so he had to finish everything that he was doing to see it working and confirmed his research before presenting it to us. Admittedly we were all amateur developers, including him, but he kinda instinctively knew what's wrong, but lack the terminologies and experience / knowledge of case studies to convey properly to us prior to his research. There was a chance his instincts could be totally wrong too. "
2109,Splitting up user stories that are enhancements that may destroy other functionality?,"We are implementing an epic. While refining this epic, we discovered that a lot of our current functionality will be impacted.  I understand that when splitting up user stories, we should vertically split stories for various reasons.  A few of the techniques to do this is to   split by workflow split by happy path/sad path split by roles etc   However, upon splitting up our stories this way, we discover that upon delivering some user stories, other existing functionality will be left non functional. How do we handle this situation?  I am currently thinking of 3 options   disable all the existing functionality related to the epic let them be and them being non functional is out of scope (known issue, will be fixed in future release) let the features exist in parallel, and disable the old one once new one is complete   How should we go about this? "
2110,Should all required user story assets be available before sizing a story or starting the sprint?,"I am a developer. Sometimes we have stories which will require some sort of asset that is not in the control of the dev team. A common example would be that the story calls for a new piece of UI to be added, but another party/department will be providing the correct copy (text) for this.  I may be told the requirements for a new story are something like:     ""We need to add something across the top here. It'll be no more than two lines of text and maybe 5 bullet points. It needs to look prominent and visually interesting.""   At this point, I have no idea what the copy will actually be, but need to size the story anyway, based on what I think it roughly entails. When it comes to sprint planning, the story is pulled into the sprint and often I am told the copy will be ready by a certain day, which falls during the upcoming sprint itself. So the story is entered into the sprint with a size, but without the assets available.  I find these stories often take me longer than I estimated, or I put off starting them because the assets aren't ready yet and I don't know when they will be. Sometimes the sprint ends and the assets still weren't available for me to start.  If I need to do some design work it sometimes takes twice as long it should because I don't really know what content I'm designing for. Other issues that crop up are things like I start the story and finish the UI, but then the copy becomes available. So I need to revisit the story and enter the copy. Then I might need to work on it again to make it look right now that the final copy is in. All this time I can't really mark the story as Done and this kind of story sitting in ""In Progress"" for days half finished clutters my mind and affects my focus on another area of development.  I feel like no story should be entered into the sprint unless all the assets are finalised and available. Is this an unrealistic expectation? We are a small company and don't really have a dedicated Scrum Master - it's basically me, but as I am also a developer and don't necessarily have time to be chasing for assets during a sprint (and I find it distracting).  What should we be doing? "
2111,Scheduling: Remaining Work,"Let's say I have a task that I've know is going to take 12 hours to do.  But when I schedule resources, I only scheduled 6 hours of resources.  How could I show that the resources are under-scheduled?  Perhaps a field that (or what calculations would I use on a custom field) that I can show [Work - Allocated Work]? "
2112,Need an advice on Project management and company structure for a small social media agency (10-15 ppl),"I need your advice folks! I know the question may be quite trivial but I haven't found any related to my situation answers. And I don't know where to start    We have new start-up company, that has grown in to 10-15 ppl too quickly, that we even hadn't time to structurise it properly. To cut long story short I would be grateful if local experienced people would give me some advice on PM methodologies and tools e.g Waterfall or Agile(Scrum)? and what would be the best way of company structure? Perhaps there are some books or other resources where I would be able to learn about the subject?  Our workflow is: Most of the time we have small projects e.g Facebook campaigns, small to medium websites and social brand development plus some small video production. Most of this projects should to last no longer than 3-4 days(in perfect world, but that's the goal of company), but in the end of the day lasts much much more longer, because of clients delays(specifications &amp; content) and lack of proper management. Director still keep trying to run the company in some flat organisation style, stating that he wants to be close to our team and be involved in any aspects of any project development. And I love it! But instead in reality he stretches him self so much (by doing PM, AM and Sales and general CEO stuff) that we always wait for briefs, scope of works and content from client. As result delays and unhappy clients.    We got some person to do Project Management(she is also Copywriter). But she is not professional PM. So as more experienced and tech person in IT I'd like to help to set it all up and make sure it all works!  COMPANY STRUCTURE:    To help better manage staff, delegate responsibilities and distribute work load we come up with a new company structure:    CEO/Creative Director (Also AM)  ^ Account Manager, Project Manager(Scrum Master + Copywriter)   ^ Marketing Manager, Senior/Lead Tech/Web Developer, Senior Graphic designer   ^ Campaign Manager, 3 x Graphic designer, Web Developer, Junior Web Developer(the guy who just know how to install and set up wordpress and bit of CSS)   And subsequently create some fixed teams - Team 1 (1 Designer + 1 Wordpress Master) Team 2 (1 Designer + 1 Web Developer) Team 3 (1 Designer + 1 Campaign Manager)    What do you think?    I like fixed teams(with an option for employee to move from one to another) because I think employe will better know in and outs of job nature. But once they get border say to design only facebook pages they can move to web design team  But I am still reflecting on cons and pros of flexed and fixed teams. The main con for me of flexed teams is employee has to handle more multitask work and be able to design well as facebook pages, as web design and as to do a branding (logos, flayers, labels etc). With junior employees that's would be difficult.  PM Methods: I believe the most progressive and modern method of managing projects now is Agile(Scrum). It was meant for small projects and small teams(5-10 ppl). Gives ability to deliver features quickly. But unfortunately I am not a scrum coach and can not be sure that it will work well for such smaller teams. Perhaps there are out there some other special tailored methods for our case?    PM TOOLS/SOFTWARE:    Currently we're using Podio. It's great software. But too huge and broad seems for us! People especially designers find it too complex. I plan to try PivotalTracker. It looks simple and seems has everything we would need I also have heard good feedbacks about Atlassian Jira. But in my opinion it is too complex as well for our small team. Only what we need is a list of tasks to do assigned for each employee and nicely track the process, with charts and progress bars etc. The management needs to see the work progress. Perhaps there are better solutions for our case?    That is it! Apology if it was too long to explain. But I wanted to give as much as possible info to give you an idea of the situation. I presume our case is not unique. And perhaps some experienced PM would be figure it out in a snap of fingers.    Looking forward to hearing you feedback folks.    Kind regards, Alex "
2113,How should be the pricing using agile?,How should be the pricing using agile? Is it fixed per sprint? 
2114,What to do with incomplete stories that depend on customers,"We're starting with scrum, user stories, and agile. Some of our tasks require final testing from our customers to verify that they are completed according to their needs, but sometimes they don't complete the testing, or respond, for well over a week (or 3). What is the best way to handle these tasks for QA? Can we close the task as complete after X days? Should we have the sales rep remind them a couple times? We're trying to load our sprints 1 week at a time, would having a larger, month-long project to push these things to be a good option? "
2115,Who should make the final design and UX decisions on a team without a designer,Our team doesn't have a dedicated UX/design employee.  Is is better for product or the engineers to have the final say for UX/design decisions?  Or should it be a majority vote? 
2116,What to do about unachievable criteria in the Definition of Done?,"I'm a first-time Scrum Master. I'm not even certified in anything PM-related; I'm just a seasoned Python/Django developer. However, I have read the latest official Scrum Guide cover-to-cover. I have also read a lot of articles and blog posts on the internet about Scrum, most of them critiques that seem to be from the short era where ""Scrum"" was a project management buzzword and lots of people were applying it incorrectly. Hopefully I am better prepared against common pitfalls when applying Scrum.  Anyway, I joined a new company last week and yesterday I conducted the first Definition of Done (DoD) exercise with my team. We are dealing with extending and evolving an existing software product into its next version. And due to the scrappiness of previous project management, the youth of the team, and the time and resource constraints, it appears that quite a few of the criteria we came up with for our DoD cannot be achieved in the imminent future. E.g. automated, repeatable functional tests and integration tests (with good coverage) are desirable, but our existing frontend has no automated test at all; somebody would need to learn stuff like Selenium and set it all up, and that takes time. An adequate level of documentation in terms of architecture, design, deployment, and usage are also desirable, but that's also currently lacking.  What do I do about such criteria?  It is obviously impractical that I say ""halt everything and fix these"", as we still have other things that need to be developed and delivered.  Do I keep those criteria on the DoD and mark them as ""currently lacking/unachievable"", and just progressively work towards being able satisfy those criteria as well, iteration by iteration?  Do I just try to satisfy more of these criteria for new development?  I mean, that's in alignment with the spirit of Kaizen, right?  What do I do about the old stuff that has already been deployed, delivered, and ""done""? "
2117,How do I calculate a project management fee on my design projects?,"I run a small business and I have to take on an additional resource to handle an increased workload from one of my clients. How do I calculate my project management fee?  I estimate I will spend about 25% of time on project management. So, do I add 25%? on top of the hourly rate or the total of my rate + resource rate? I've heard varying different methods... "
2118,How to handle projects with historic data,"I work for a company that sells an out-of-the-box software, but I recently remarked that our projects are becoming hell, because of our commercial staff that accept the requests from some clients to transform and import data from legacy systems. These requests produce too much pain, effort, scope creep, fixes, and data correction, apart from other project activities.   I am not a supporter of importing data when a company starts with new philosophy and new software. I prefer to start from scratch and if you want to query old data, then mine your backup to get past data to compare.  How can I handle these negotiations to stop accepting these activities even if they are paid? What are the risks to saying no to these activities? "
2119,Where to start in agile-based documentations and what are the best practices to start with?,"We're currently working on our documentation and we sort of followed Scrum.   Which diagrams, charts, figures, and etc should I include in our documentation? Also, what are the best practices in documenting the ""just right"" amount of documentation? "
2120,When should I start planning for the next version?,My company is setting dates for planning the version on the first day of the version.   To me it seems to be waaaay too late.. I think it should be at least a couple of weeks before that.   When should we start the planning process? Is there a standard for this process and how it should be handled? 
2121,How to use the catalog of Pattern Languages of Programs (a.k.a. Scrum PLoP)?,"A few days ago I watched a talk by James ""Cope"" Coplien, titled ""Patterns: The New Defacto Scrum Standard"". It is then that I learned that ""organizational patterns"" is a thing. Apparently, Scrum is just a set of organisational patterns - as in, you could define the Scrum framework in terms of organisational patterns, and that would be equivalent to what is defined in the official Scrum Guide. Frankly speaking, I still had no idea how organization patterns are related to Scrum after watching the whole talk.  So I found the Scrum PLoP website and the associated catalog of patterns. The catalog is HUGE, but there doesn't seem to be any kind of foreword or introduction page about how to use that catalog in the context of implementing the Scrum framework, especially for software development.  Has anybody heard about Scrum PLoP before? How do you use it? Or maybe point me to a clear explanation somewhere? "
2122,Jira Project vs Epics vs Categories,"Hi I am bit confused with the term project. Right now i am working as a project Manager in a startup firm where we have one prime client with a full time dedicated work and our product is an online event management website. This website is a huge product in itself and spans across multiple components/modules like search, payments, profiles etc. So now i have just started using Jira and i want to know should i consider each component/module as an individual project? Or there should be one project and those modules should be considered as an epic. Another point to consider here is that many of those modules are already build and tasks/features keep coming into them. So should I consider them as components in JIRA? If I consider them as Epic then there might be a situation where I won't be able to close that epic ever. But the plus side I can manage it from my single project. And can I say this hierarchy is correct?  Product-->Project-->Epics-->Story  And can we have a single backlog for multiple projects if we opt for that option? Please help me I am very confused.  "
2123,What is the role of test manager in a scrum team?,"In a company, they are transitioning from agile to scrum. They have hired a very skilled scrum master to facilitate change, they have an up to speed product owner, a development manager who is up to speed with scrum, and the business supports the change. Also in this company, there is a test manager who has his own test team of four testers.   The scrum master disagrees with this tactic, saying that the testers are developers, and they are members of the scrum team, wanting to scrap the ""test team"". He believes that each member of the team should be able to test as well as develop, but the test manager disagrees, believing that his testers are specialized in what they do, and that testing before production is a vital job that he cannot leave it to chance, or to people who don't know the testing process.  The test manager gathers his testers for a mini meeting after the morning standup, in a separate room, without informing the others or updating them on their talks. The test manager has no previous scrum experience either. He believes that if any of his testers forgets or doesn't do something, he should go around and chase them.  What would your suggestions be for this business, and the development manager and scrum master for the test manager, who seems resistant to this business change and wants to retain his team?  Update: The SM asked to be invited in the testers meeting. It turns out it is another stand up just for the testers. They are effective duplicating work after the team stand up. Is this necessarily bad though?  "
2124,"How can we continuously integrate new features when the PO only determines whether a feature is ""done"" at the end of each Sprint?","My team is having an issue with integrating software product features. Specifically, when do features get pull requested into our integration branch of code?  Currently our understanding is:   The Product Owner is the only person who can say that a feature or User Story is ""done"". The Product Owner makes his decision on whether a User Story is ""done"" at the end of sprint, during the Sprint Review Meeting.   With the points above, it appears that pull requests for our ""done"" features or User Stories should occur at the end of our sprints. But how can this be the case?  If we merge several features together after we get the Product Owner's approval, it may be the case that the features conflict or break each other. Now the features are no longer ""done"", additional work to resolve conflicts must be done, etc.  How can we continuously integrate our new features (allowing us to do realistic integration testing) while retaining the fact that the Product Owner is the final say of whether or not a feature is ""done""? "
2125,Is it ok to make developer responsible for one of sprint goals?,"Currently in our project the situation is that we can have several goals. And it works fine for us to make a team member responsible for acheiving a particular goal.  But recently I tried to pass ""Scrum Open"" test and saw a statement in one of the questions that put me in doubt. It was:  ""Sprint Backlog and all of its items are collectively owned by the Development Team. No individual team member can claim ownership over an item as this would block communication and collaboration.""  So I wonder: is it ok to make a developer responsible for a goal in Scrum? Does it break any of Scrum rules? What disadvantages could be there? "
2126,Should we count a story that is no longer required by Client/PO/Management in our velocity?,We have finished a story which is no longer required by the Product Owner (PO) or Management. The completed story is not going to add any business value. What should we do in this case? Should we count the effort in our velocity or not? 
2127,How to write a very specific objective for a project?,"I am working on a case study which is like below :   Economic inequality is a huge issue. A recent study found that the world's 80 wealthiest individuals own as much as the entire world's poorest 3.5 billion people. The richest 1 percent of the world's population control half of the world's total wealth.15 Many individuals, corporations, charities, and government agencies have projects and programs in place to attempt to tackle this and other important global issues such as sustainability, but there are many opportunities to do more.  A trinidad group of college students has decided to work together to do their part in making the world a better place. The students are from many different countries, and several of them met at global conferences, through study abroad experiences, or on various Internet groups. Strategic goals of this group include developing skills for both college students and for needy populations, sharing information on existing products and services that promote economic growth and sustainability, and promoting entrepreneurship. Leaders of this group were reviewing some ideas for projects (all with a significant IT component) that they could do to support their strategic goals:  XYZ: Many people are familiar with the television show called Shark Tank where entrepreneurs (sometimes called “treps”) present their business ideas to a group of investors or sharks. Several colleges, high schools, and even elementary schools throughout the world hold unique versions of a shark tank like event. You believe that creating a nonprofit organization with one central mobile-friendly website/application to assist groups in organizing these types of events would spark even more entrepreneurs throughout the world. You would plan to hold several shark tank like events during the term of the project and create a site and applications to help continue developing more XYZ. This site/application would include the following capabilities:  • Provide guidelines and templates for running a shark tank type of event.   • Accept donations from potential investors targeted toward specific schools or organizations wishing to host an event.  • Accept ideas for needed new products or services.  • Provide the ability for organizations to create their own custom site to solicit local participants and sharks, accept applications, and promote the winners as well as losers.  • Research ideas for a mechanism where a certain percentage of all donations and profits earned by contestants are donated back to the XYZ organization.  • Provide an online version of the events by showing videos of contestants and live reactions of the sharks while also getting live inputs and donations from viewers.  I have created a document called as Project Charter in which I have written Project Objective like below :   Project Objectives:   Creating an application that will allow entrepreneurs to share their ideas with group of investors or with other entrepreneurs or sharks in shark tank type of event. This project will help in developing more projects like this in future.  My Lead(who reviewed my Project Charter) told me that this objective is not very specific as per SMART but I dont understand how and why?  Can someone please tell me how my project objective should look like if we follow SMART ? "
2128,Can we say that a Sprint and a source code branch are almost the same things?,"I'm going to begin a universitarian project with my fellows. It is required that we use one of the Agile Methods together with Bitbucket. We'd like to begin with Scrum. I've read its documentation and it seems very powerful.  My question is about the Sprint in Scrum and the branch in Bitbucket. Can we say that a Sprint and a branch are almost the same things?  If so, we will open our very first branch in BitBucket and this will be our first Sprint. Is this the correct interpretation of this method, or it would be more appropriate (by ""appropriate"" I mean ""following best practice"") for every member of our group to open his own branch? "
2129,Are there alternatives to estimation? (Software development),"I am taking control of a small project for the first time, and want to tell if we can deliver our scope on schedule.  Most teams I have worked in have used story-based estimations. My experience of these as a developer has so far been rather poor:   sessions were long, inefficient and unfocused, making them both expensive and demoralising they haven't worked well when the technology or the domain were unfamiliar teams I've been in haven't improved estimates with time many teams have social incentives to over or under estimate they are easy to turn into a stick, waved menacingly at developers. This too promotes over-estimation. they were, ultimately, guesses. They were rarely data-driven.   These experiences have been consistent across five companies I've worked in, including ten person startups and a thousand-strong megacorp. I don't think they're just anomalies.  Are there any alternatives worth trying? I am interested in Kanban and wonder if we could use historical measurements to continually hone our planning.  Finally, if estimation sessions are simply a necessary evil - how can I make them suck less? "
2130,Is it OK for the scrum master to be remote?,Is it OK for the scrum master to be remote when the rest of the team is co-located?  I.e. the team is located at one office but the scrum master lives in another city and serves the team remotely?  (I ask because we are hiring a scrum master.)   Pros/Cons? 
2131,Building common culture in a contracting organization?,"In a software development organization doing contracting work, where there are typically only a handful of developers working for any one customer and there is a fairly large number of customers, what are good ways of building a common culture and developing the skills of the individual developers?  Work practices within each project are typically largely set by the customer (though it might be possible to exert some influence) and the projects tend to be full time and long term. This means developers have more attachment to the customer than to their own organization and each learn idiosyncratic ways rather than a common culture. Many of them are rather junior and will therefore be easily influenced by what they see in a project.  An obvious idea would be to have team meetings where teams can exchange experiences and discuss best practice, but I'm not sure how to keep these productive. Team members will also tend to be reluctant to bring up problems in their projects at such meetings.  Any ideas or experiences? "
2132,Defining user story in Scrum: how specific must they be?,"As the title suggests: for example, the following user story too generic?   ""A registered user wants to login in order to use the site's services""    Or, should I use more detailed user stories, like the following ones?  1. ""User insert email and password in the textboxes and click the login button"";  2. ""Server receives login data and check if they contain errors"";  3. ""Server puts the new user in the database if the login data are correct"";  4. ""The logged user is brought to his profile page"".   It seems the more it is specific, the more we understand the part of codes required ( 1)""textboxes"", 1) ""login button"", 3) ""database"", ...).  Which is the correct way between these two? "
2133,Scrum vs. Sprint,"I'm new to Agile methodology and I have some very basic questions.  Sprint -> It is the iterative process (One development life cycle from Requirement to user acceptance testing) in Scrum.  So, while doing delivery to the client, we say that Sprint 1 and Sprint 2 etc. would deliver?  Where would we use the term Scrum?  What is the delivery time of one Scrum?  Please clarify to me the exact difference between Scrum and Sprint in an easy way to understand. "
2134,Metrics for changing a process,"I am trying to automate a manual process in my organization. There's one component which has a very repetitive coding. So i decided to automate it. Before jumping on to the automation, I want to quantify my reasons for automation. So i decided to come up with a set of metrics.   Problem  Consider 3 sub-components within the main component.   Every sub-component can have two parameters:   Frequency of repetitiveness of code(rated 1-5; 5 being highest) and  manual effort (rated 1-5; 5 being highest).    Depending on these two parameters, I can devise an automation index.   Some facets of the question:   how to devise the automation index which gives me a rating so as to help automate a particular sub-component?  Do i multiply or add the values from frequency and effort?  Are these parameters sufficient for my scenario?    Please Advise!! :) "
2135,What to do if a developer is waiting on a colleague to complete his side of the story during a sprint?,"So today I was managing my team and they are in the middle of a sprint, I went over to my dev team just to find out how they are getting on. Turned out that one of my developers was waiting on his colleague to finish his side of the story before beginning work. In the mean time, he was working on items in the backlog out of his own accord, since the rest of items in the sprint required his colleague to completed before he could intervene.  When this happens, should you add items from the backlog into the sprint for the developer to complete during the time he is waiting for his colleague to complete his side of the work? Or should you let the developer freestyle? "
2136,When to consider multiple PBIs when determining the HOW?,"Consider that we have 10 Product Backlog Items (PBIs) that have been estimated and, if all goes well, will make it into our next sprint, after Sprint Planning.  At what point would it be appropriate to have the team think about ALL 10 PBIs as sort of a way to understand the end goal of this 10 PBI effort (assuming all PBIs are associated with a common theme/epic)?  While it's understood that each PBI will deliver value on it's own, it's often helpful for the team to know what is next since it can help inform technical decisions.  Meetings that I've considered for this work:  Grooming - Doesn't seem like the right time because this would be too much about the ""HOW"" when we should be discussing the ""WHAT"" Planning - Too late since the PBIs have already been defined.  I always assumed that, by this time, everyone would be ready to sign up and task out the PBIs.  When is the right time to do this?  Or is this a PBI quality issue?  Would this be in the tasking phase of Sprint Planning?  I would think that is too late in the process, since it's possible that information gathered during this effort would help restructure PBIs. "
2137,Scrumming part time. Need to know exact hours?,"I want to introduce Scrum to my group of devs. We are students and some of us have jobs. Our availability of dev hours is not ideal but Scrum seems to be very good for us.   Do we need to know exactly how many hours a week each of us can invest in the project?   If so, would it be better to keep these hours consistent? e.g. 3 hours on Monday, 2 hours on Tuesday each week of a sprint, etc "
2138,At what level should the Product Owner prioritize work?,"I work for a small software company and I am the Scrum Master. In this company we have a small group of people who consist our StakeHolders. To represent the StakeHolder's interest the stakeholders choose one of themselves to be product owner. To me this is all fine and dandy as long as we have some one who is responsible for what the development team works on. Unfortunately the company is maintaining several projects at one time and there is always competing items for development time.   Here is my question, at what level does the product owner prioritize work? My product owner likes to say we need to work on Large Project A, Large Project B, Small Project C. The time line for these items are due in 2 months. A the Product Owner considers that to be the priority of items.   Alot of the resources I have read about Scrum says the Product Owner organizes work by features. Supposedly, a great product owner will organize items in priority to maximize the amount of work the team can do. From what I read, it seems to me that our product owner is only a Product Owner in name, where he is actually just a StakeHolder representing StakeHolders.  If I am right about this, what is an effective way to correct the Product Owner and Stake Holder on his management style? "
2139,What are the reasons to (or not to) exclude QA from your sprint,My team is newly formed and trying to establish a baseline for their velocity in story points per sprint. The problem is at the moment the QA is part of the sprint. It has been suggested that it is excluded and that only the development phase is in the actual sprint. Why? Also should the velocity of QA (and BA before the sprint I guess) not be part of the team velocity?  Thanks! :) 
2140,Why is MS Project 2016 Showing a $0 for BCWP on a completed task,"I am not understanding how MS Project (2016, in this case) calculates the BCWP component of Earned Value. To illustrate: below is a one-task project. The task is five days long, has one resource assigned 8/hrs per day at $10 per hr. The task starts 4/29 and finishes 5/5.The task is set to use Physical % Complete as the basis for Earned Value calculations, and the project is set to not calculate Actual Cost automatically (so I can enter an Actual Cost manually).   I set the project's baseline and all works as it should: baseline cost is set to $400.   Then I set the task to 100% complete and the Physical % Complete also to 100%. I enter an actual cost of [tex]400 BCWS.  Lastly, I set the Project Status Date to 5/9/16, after the finish date of the task.   What I get is shown below. I don't understand why BCWP is [tex]400. Shouldn't Project show $400 for the BCWP on this completed task? Calculating the Project has no effect.    I'm not the world's greatest MS Project expert, so I suspect I'm doing something wrong here, and I'd appreciate any insights as to what my error is. Am I mis-understanding BCWP? Do I have some setting wrong?  Thanks for any help. "
2141,What to do if functional requirements violate non functional?,"How to manage (find out and preserve) the consistency of different types of requirements?   Example: That is great to have gathered many functional requirements (e.g. IS functionality that the system should perform, gathered through brain storming), but what if all this functions will violate the ergonomics of the future system (all these functions could not be placed in menues, GUI or are very problematic to describe with icons or words)? Such kind of problems could not be clear from the beginning of the project.  Are there some good techniques to manage such business inconsistencies? Good Papers, books, articles?  Does somebody know more examples of such inconsistencies?  Upd.: How to manage (find out and preserve) the consistency of different types of requirements? "
2142,Should managers be involved in decisions about what technical practices the team adopts?,"With the popularity of agile methodologies on the rise it comes the time to make decisions about what it means to be done with a given feature/task. Should the managers be involved in the decisions about which technical practices the team should or should not adopt? Examples of such practices are:   Test driven development (TDD) Pair programming (PP) Continous integration (CI) Continuous delivery (CD)   A common objection to adoption of such practices from a managerial point of view is that  they ""make the progress slower."" I'm not trying to imply micro-management is bad per se, but in modern times it has gained a negative connotation since the rise of trends like empowering your employees and the fact the a lot of people perform better when they are given more autonomy over their work.  Is there any framework that deals with the question of when managers should micro-manage and when they should not? "
2143,Why does Pivotal Tracker discourage estimating points for bugs and chores?,"Pivotal Tracker ""strongly discourages"" estimating velocity points for bugs and chores – you have to change a setting and accept a warning to be able to do it.  They explain why here, but I just don't understand it. Here is an excerpt:     By measuring velocity in terms of features only, Tracker can estimate how much real, business-valued work can be completed in future iteration, allowing you to predict when project milestones might be achieved   Chores and bugs take time. How can ignoring this help you to predict when a milestone will be reached?  Say you need to complete three more features to get to the next milestone, and you also need to complete a chore (because one of the features can't be started until that chore is done)... How could discounting the time needed for the chore help you to estimate when the milestone will be reached? "
2144,Multiple feature teams but no version control; how to scale delivery?,"OK; this is a real-world question rather than a theoretical construct.  Context: Multinational company flirting with scaled Agile and/or Nexus.  Currently have 3 large agile programmes of 200+ developers in each. The most mature programme has 20 feature teams and 6 of those feature teams have been selected to pilot Nexus.  Problem: The teams were originally structured around product feature sets (teleconference integration, digital transformation, sales/customer contact history) which had little to no dependency between each team.  The move to Nexus means all teams should prioritise all of the highest priority stories even though it means all teams start working within the same codebase (, that is, all work on teleconference integration).  Curveball: The technology we are working on is not very mature and it has no version control at present. It's coming in the next 12 months. Essentially, one developer locks out a coding object until it is deployed to the next environment which causes delays for other developers and teams.  Question  What is the best way to scale delivery? Is it for all teams to work on the highest priority items (a la Nexus guidance) even though dependencies will slow down delivery; or is it better to split the feature sets across teams so they can work independently and integrate the increments in a longer cycle?  I am looking for thoughts from the agile community; I have my own opinion, but I want to see how others have interpreted Nexus and the solution to this problem. "
2145,How to estimate accurate velocity when team members are on leave,"I am a Scrum Master of a team with 12 members. I know that the size of the team is large at this point, but as we grow further we will divide the team into multiple Scrum Teams. Our estimations for the User Stories are based on Story Points. For the tasks within a User Story we are estimating in hours. Based on the first 6 Sprints we were able to establish a team Velocity.   We did not have any issues in taking the User Stories, because we knew how many User Stories we could take for the Sprint based on our Velocity. When a couple of team members went on a planned leave, we were unable to estimate the number of Story Points we had to commit. Since we are not calculating Velocity per team member, we are unable to estimate how many Story Points we should take for the next Sprint. So, my question is how do we calculate the story points we can commit to the sprint when some of the team members are on a leave?  My second question is we are calculating the number of hours each team member is available for the sprint. As we should not directly map Story Points to hours, we are not seeing the value of calculating the number of hours for each team member during the Sprint Planning Meeting. How do we establish a relation between hours and story points? "
2146,"When a resource is over allocated why does the ""extend duration of task"" option sometimes not appear?","I am pretty green and I am having an issue. I have 2 staff that can commit 50% of their time to the project. I opened the resource sheet and set their units to 50%. Then when I assign someone to a large task, maybe 15 hours, it shows they are over allocated. Sometimes it gives me the option to extend the duration and sometimes it does not. What are the conditions that make the system give that option? Can I force it to extend the duration?   The business case is this. The staff will be writing a piece of software, lets say the search functionality will take 20 hours to complete, I want to see how long it will take if the resource has 50% availability.   If anyone can point me in the right direction that would help a lot!  "
2147,How do we prevent debates over whether changes to user stories are new work or bugs?,"I'm struggling to determine where capturing of user story elaborations and discussions fits into agile. A lot of what I have read and agree with is:   You should be focusing on discussions with your BAs and clients to elaborate the stories. Figure out what needs to be done rather than documenting every single requirement.   How do we capture enough details so that in a month or so, when someone in those discussions comes back and their memory of it was different from ours, we don't get into a debate/discussion over whether it is a new story or a bug because we didn't implement right in the first place?  This debate occurs because of maybe the scale of the change required due to this disagreement. Do we need to capture every decision ""on paper"" to avoid debates? Doing this is appears a bit contrary to some of the Agile Manifesto. "
2148,Schedule Control,"Here's the scenario: You are building a schedule for a project that has a planned duration about three months.  You are not concerned about project costs so you will not be doing EV.  You are developing the schedule ensuring that your work packages are linked to represent your planned sequencing and all of your packages are fixed duration.  Once complete, you baseline the schedule and you have a good representation of your current critical path.    During execution, maybe you are 30% complete from a time perspective, you update the schedule with progress (assume you have a valid and credible way of capturing work complete).  The project finish date is starting to show an unfavorable finish variance, adding about 1.5 weeks to the three month project.  You estimate work remaining and, due to some changes in the way you do the work and other interventions, you estimate that you can shave off the finish variance and actually come in sooner than planned with a favorable variance of four days.     Do you alter the durations of the remaining work packages based on your latest revised estimate, allowing the schedule to calculate a finish that shows the favorable finish variance? If so, do you process the change in duration through your change control or do you consider duration something outside of what is baselined? Or, do you keep your original baselined duration the same and show in another way your latest revised estimate and the resulting finish date?  If so, how?  "
2149,Good way to do a personal project review - what questions to ask,"I'm a project engineer with a consultancy. My work includes planning but also chasing after  contractors to make sure they deliver what they are paid for, and to keep communication between us, customer and contractor. I guess this can be seen as project management.  I'm in a late phase of my first project in this role. I plan to write a journal (for me, not to share with boss/coworkers) with what went wrong and how to improve next time. This will focus on the process issues, not on the technical ones.  The obvious way to go about this is to ask myself these questions:   What went wrong? What could have gone better? What should I try different the next time?   Are there other questions I should ask myself? "
2150,Are there any respected Kanban certifications?,"Are there any respected, or at least well-known, Kanban certificates? There are many Scrum certifications, some of them can be taken online (scrum.org), others require participation in a stationary course (scrum alliance), but I could not be able to find any Kanban course (preferably with certificate) that would encourage my trust.  And by the way, do you find this kind of certificates any useful? Do you think, that candidate with such certificates (assuming the same achievements and experience) have any advantage over the others? "

2154,How can I complete a project with unfixed requirements from the client?,"How can I politely ask a customer to participate in the design of the deliverables before we begin work?  I have received a content update and brochure design job from client. Unfortunately it is so difficult to close this project because the client never gives us a clear direction of what we should put in the documents.  He has sent us a lot of sample documents/brochure from other companies in similar industries. He asked us to follow the contents in the documents and send back the draft to him for review after we are done.  Each brochure has very different contents, even though they are for the same product. For example, the brochure from company A might have a pricing section, while the brochure from company B might have technical specifications. What we do is include all the things from all the brochures and put it in a PDF that we send back to him. The next day, he asks us to redo it because he saw another brochure from company C. So we repeat the process.  We have also sent him a Word document with all the contents and asked him to change the wording, removing anything that he doesn't want. Unfortunately, he just ignores it and asks us to design the brochure in PDF and put all the content inside first. After he sees the design, then he will decide what should change.  I am not sure whether other clients on similar projects do this, but this is the first time I have encountered this type of customer. Going back and forth is really wasting a lot of time and money. How can I politely ask the customer to make a decision first on what he wants in the document? "
2155,"In Scrum, who is responsible for the project's budget?","I have read many books about Scrum, blogs and academic articles. Though, all of them dodge from explicitly acknowledging this question:  Who is responsible for the project's money?  Why is this person responsible versus someone else? "
2156,How does the team deliver consistent velocity when user stories are de-scoped mid-way through a sprint?,"We are using the Rally tool for managing our sprints. Mid-way through one of the sprints, the Product Owner de-scoped two user stories. These two stories are complex user stories carrying 8 story points each. Almost 80% of effort was already spent on these user stories. So, the team stopped working on these two user stories. I have couple of questions.   How should the burn-down chart be represented because the user stories carrying bulk of the size for this sprint was de-scoped. As a scrum master do I need reset the Y-axis in the burn-down chart with the story points that are still in scope? If I don’t reset the Y-axis the burn-down chart may present a wrong picture to management that as a team we could not deliver what was committed In our estimation meeting for the release we projected X story points for the release. Now, what we will be delivering  X-16 story points as we de-scoped two user stories. By the release date, if these situations continue to arise we will be delivering far less story points than what we committed for the release. What this mean is that the cost we incur will not reduce if we deliver fewer story points. As a Scrum Master, how do I neutralize the cost vs. story points delivery? How does the team book the timesheet for the work? The team did 80% of the work, but the user story itself was not completed. Do I need to mark the user story as completed and ask the team to fill the hours?  "
2157,Subtask linking,I have 2 tasks like Task A and B.  Task A has 2 Subtask named A1 and A2 and the same for Task B(B1 and B2).  Task B1 needs Task A1 to be done befor starting and Task B2 needs Task B1 to be done before starting.  Actually I have dozens of these type of tasks and I can't link them all one by one.  If I just link the Summary tasks together then Microsoft project will calculate the subtasks dependencies for me too ?  Here is an example. In animation studios first we Draw something as reference then we will start modeling of it so I have 2 summary tasks named : Designing and Modeling.  If I have 100 object to Design then how can I create my Project plan !? 
2158,"From user stories to product, where and when to do graphic design?","We are taking our first steps in the Agile development world, and while we have a long path to follow, I'm having difficulties incorporating our graphic designer in the development process.   The previous PO believed in a Product definition =&gt; designer =&gt; Developers flow. The designer worked with the product manager to create a presentation of exact images of the app, sending it to the developers for implementation. This created a huge waste as any change required the designer to update many slides. As well, since he made all images for the whole app beforehand, when the app development progressed, there were changes to the design which again made him change many many slides. Another problematic issue was that the images do not explain expected behavior - what happens when there's an error? using what animation a popup should appear? this caused a lot of expected-behaviour related bugs.  To eliminate this waste, I've asked the designer to create a set images for each story, when most of the image is a sketch of the app and only the parts related to the current feature are actual images. In addition, I've asked the product manager to write the acceptance criteria defining the expected behaviour (which includes any behaviour or specific error messages).  This was just a shot in the dark, and I am not sure that is the way to go. I would appreciate anyone who can share his thought about the process described here, if there is anything I should do differently. "
2159,How do you calculate extra costs incurred if a project overruns its schedule?,"If a project doesn't meet its planned schedule, how do you calculate any losses per day incurred? Is there a graphing function in MS Project that I can use to depict losses per day? "
2160,How to atone for Fixed costs within MS Project which are based on duration?,"I have successfully implemented fixed costs for a few of my tasks, one of them being accommodation cost which is a ""one off"" cost. However, how do I input fixed costs for tasks which rely on the duration?  For example, one of my tasks involves renting special machinery for 2 days (which is my duration), the cost of renting this equipment is £13,500 per day. So how do I work out the cost, baring in mind that 2 days is the estimated period, in best case scenario the task may take one day,in worst case scenario it may take four days.   So how do I input renting costs? do I just calculate them based on the duration so £13,500 x 2 (days) .. making the fixed cost of £27,000? "
2161,How to manage stakeholder expectations when they keep on raising the bar,"Long story short, we are building a product and I have introduced then implemented the Scrum framework for product management. It has been working extremely well, and my team have done an amazing job.  The problem that I am having now, is that the main stakeholder is starting to get feature hungry to the point that the quality of deliverables is getting affected from an increased amount of items in the sprint.   Every time we do a good job, i.e. meet the sprint, the following week, the stakeholder then asks for more features. He feels that because we met the sprint, we can do more work the following week.   (Right now, he wants 3 features delivered per week)  My team then have to make up for this by upping their velocity. Eventually it has got to a point, where in one sprint we've had the kitchen sink thrown at us, and are expected to deliver triple amount of features relative to previous sprints. Due to the increased velocity that also means more bugs are appearing from features being rushed to production.  I am now in a situation when we are starting to fall behind on our sprints, with my co workers complaining that the workload is too much. I am also getting a lot more heat from the stakeholder for not completing all of the work that has been promised. At our next team meeting, I am think about talking to my stakeholder with the dev team about this, is this a good idea?  How can I handle this? "

2163,What do you do next after creating an SRS?,"Having gone through the IEEE standard document (IEEE 830-1998) on what a Software Requirements Specification should contain I'm now looking for guidance on the next steps following the creation of an SRS  As I believe it an SRS is designed to ensure that the development team and customer are on the same page when it comes to figuring out the functionality and scope of the project. What I'd like to do now is go from this document and write up how to implement the project for the development team.  Essentially I'm looking for the next step after completing an SRS. I realise that broadly this is ""implement the project"", but how do you convert an SRS into something a developer can use? i.e. How do they know what tests need to be written?  "

Can I create an alternative schedule with 2 devs with existing tasks and constraints, estimates and compare with original schedule to understand the impact ? (Not a baseline) Can you use a revisioning in MS project. For example I go ahead and create new schedule with 2 devs and call it revision 2. Once I understand the impact can I revert back to original revision ?  "

2170,Is velocity a valid measure of team and process improvement?,"I've asked this question to few scrum masters: ""How do you tell, that your team is improving? How do you tell that actions taken during retrospective result in real improvement in efficiency/productivity?""  Most answers I get are ""when velocity grows"". Or the opposite, when you see velocity fall, it is indication of worsening performance of the team.  Is there any basis behind this? Can velocity be used as a metric by which the team can tell if it is improving? Or is it simply case of using the most available metric instead of looking for metric that can be shown to be related to actual improvement?  One thing I'm worried about is that team can easily game this by simply estimating higher. So instead of task taking 2, they would give it 3. Creating an illusion of improving velocity. "
2171,How can I draw a Spaghetti Diagram of an industrial space with lots of different rooms?,"Using Lean methodologies, I have to optimize both product and people flow in an old printing house. The building has 3 floors with two elevators on one side. This printing house uses a ""Soviet-designed"" industrial building, which means there are lots of corridors and every machine has its own room. The final result of the analysis will likely be to break down some walls, design some working cells, and so on.  How can I draw a Spaghetti Diagram for both product and people flow in this environment? I have 3 other people that I can assign to this task. Since there are lots of different rooms, the use of cameras to record movements of products and people would be useless. What else could I do? "
2172,Sprint Goal and Failure of a Sprint,"My organisation is pushing for strictness on what they consider a Sprint Failure or not.  They have decided that if there are any User Stories not fully completed (as per the DoD) at the end of the Sprint, the Sprint has failed.  This also includes Stories that have been removed from the Sprint (either because the Dev Team realised it could no longer complete the work, or because the PO has deemed the Story as redundant or lower priority).   I understand the concept and the objective of this (complete all planned work in a given Sprint seems sensible) but there is no focus on the Sprint Goal.  To me, the objective of each Sprint is to achieve the Sprint Goal.  If this means a Story has to be removed (without it affecting the Sprint Goal), then it's not necessarily a Sprint failure. The team can still learn from this in the next Sprint.    If a User Story was not completed in full but the Sprint Goal was still achieved because the unfinished Story was not that vital to the Goal, is this really justification for a failed Sprint?  As a Scrum Master, I have a hard time with this 'rule' but I'm not entirely sure how to back my opinion up.  Any thoughts? "
2173,How can I divide a swimlane in 3 in JIRA?,"We currently have 3 swimlanes (To Do, In Progress, Done), but in our first swimlane, we have both issues that are To Do and Ready.  At the beginning of the sprint, this is easy to know, everything in the sprint is Ready, but as the sprint goes on, some issues get moved to To Do, as they might be missing some information.  Is there a way to distinguish from To Do and Ready in the same swimlane? Like a division of some sort? "
2174,Product Owner depending too much on the team,"I am a Scrum Master for two different teams. The product owner of one of the teams left recently, so we have a new product owner. The team is fairly experienced with the product. Since the product owner is new to the product she is relying far too much on the team to come up with user stories and also slicing the stories from epics. In the last two to three sprints she has consumed lot of time from the team by scheduling meetings with them, which is resulting in the loss of valuable time for the developers in completing their user stories.  How should I handle the situation as a Scrum Master so that I can address the following problems?   What should I do to ensure that the product owner does not eat away the valuable time of the developers? What should I do to make sure so that our product owner becomes effective and be self sufficient so that she will not overly rely on the team? How should I tell the product owner not to interfere with the team on daily basis? How do I tell her this without affecting her morale and also without affecting the relationship with the team and with me?  "
2175,Is there a difference in methodology between low and high budget projects?,"I ask the question since I'm a relatively new PM (less than 3 years). Currently, the project budget I deal with are around the [tex]250/hour). Now I see some projects that fall under the $1 million+ mark, so here's the question in a more elaborated form:  With my projects, I have a Project charter, plot out my WBS, create schedules, analyze Budget and resource allocation, and all that other fun stuff (no sarcasm intended, I really do enjoy being a PM). I also work closely with teams and stakeholders to ensure the project's on time and on budget (tons of communication).  Are there any differences in what I'm doing now with my current budgets than what other PMs do with multi-million dollar ones? I'd love to progress to that level, so I'd like to know if there are some additional skills/qualifications I need? "
2176,"Within Jira, how to identify current team allocations?","The objective is to pre-seed the user-project allocation matrix in HR system using the data pulled from Jira.  This allocation does not need to be 100% precise as it will then get reviewed, and subsequently managed inside the workforce planner part of HRM.   The challenge is, how to identify from the data in Jira, which people are working on which projects?  What we have tried so far: Simply see which issues in that project have been worked by which people within the last x days (such as 30 days).  This seems to give an ok working snapshot of user-project allocation.  Is there a better heuristic to consider? "
2177,How to account for new work items while implementing a story without affecting the sprint scope?,"During a sprint in scrum, the scope of the sprint should not change. However, I often find that after the sprint starts and I begin working on a story, I discover new stories that must be done. For example, I encounter a bug in the code.  In this case, I usually create a new bug issue and start working on that as it's blocking my main story. However, this expands the scope of the sprint.  I also sometimes find that when I start working on story, I break the story down into smaller parts, create stories for each of these. Then I link these stories to the original story. However, this again expands the scope of the sprint, and also it sometimes duplicates some of the story points, because some work is accounted for in the smaller stories which are related to the bigger story.  Therefore, my question is how do I account for new work that I discover while working on stories in scrum without affecting the scope of the sprint? Or is it acceptable to expand the scope of the sprint in this case?  I don't usually add the new work items to the backlog because they often block the main story I'm working on, so I just start implementing them straight away. "
2178,Big 4 scrum consultant giving bad advice - correct or let fail?,"An agile coach was called to promote agile in a big bank. In one of his teams, half of the team is external consultants who have been there for 3-4 years. They currently implement Sales Force.  In the words of the Team's Certified Scrum Master, their Software Development Lifecyle is:   Do a high level analysis for about 1.5 months In this phase everyone is creating user stories, since the Product Owner (PO) is too busy to write all of the user stories coming from all the workshops that are currently happening to lock down the system's specs. They claimed that this 1.5 month of discovery and design is necessary, since there is massive inter-connection amongst the pieces in Sales Force, and that they have to  decide upfront what they can implement and what not (based on external dependencies). Create a Backlog with all the user stories that will be prioritized during the sprints by the PO, and run sprint planning sessions. Deliver in an ""sprint"" - iterative fashion for 3 months  Last 3 months, back end / integration testing with the rest of the existing systems.   The consultant even mentioned that comprehensive documentation is needed in case something goes wrong, and they need to refer back to who's fault is it, so that the consultancy is in the clear.  They currently do stand ups (?) to report what they did yesterday, and what they will do today, but no planning meeting or retrospective, as they are in the ""designing phase"".  The agile coach raised this with a couple of other managers and they said in an eye rolling fashion ""yeah, these (consultancy name here) do it their own way and have their own agenda.""  The PO is clearly biased to follow the consultant's approach, since they have been working together for a while, and she has been a program manager for a while, and then converted to a PO.  Have you had experience similarly with external consultants who claim to have figured it out, but have got it all wrong, but are strongly positioned within a company?  Should the agile coach enforce a practice and claim that everything they do is agile, or should he let them fail and feel the pain before he intervenes? "
2179,Is it possible to use agile on infrastructure projects where scope is known upfront?,"How to use agile methodology for Infrastructure projects where the Scope is known upfront?  Project examples   Data Center migration/relocation SAN Migration For Cisco's Telepresence Solution Telephony Projects   The scope is not changing, most of the project will run from Runbook.  If not possible, does that mean infrastructure projects are mostly done using Waterfall?  "
2180,Career path change to Technical Project Manager and related qualifications,"Before getting into the question, let me give a brief introduction about myself and the reason for me to have this question.  I'm a Senior Software Engineer with over 6 years of industry experience working with many local and foreign clients, managing tech teams and developing platforms (mostly web-based). At my current employer, I started working as a Software Engineer and soon after got promoted to the Senior Software Engineer level.   From the very first project I was assigned, I was assigned as a team lead. The first project was 3 members, then 7 and currently I'm working with a team of 17 members. The funny part is there are members who are in 'Tech Lead' and 'Architect' level as well. Even though all those teams are consists of members in all the domains (Dev, QA, BA, etc.) I've been the decision-maker for quite some time. Yes, there is a designated PM and a PC (Project Coordinator) but most of the time, I was making the technical related decisions regarding the project. Senior members in the team are backing up my decisions because with the experiences I have as an Engineer, I'm making more informative and practical decisions.   That being said, with the current situation, I've having thoughts on shifting my career path to a position of ""Technical Project Manager"". With the experiences I have in both areas (Engineering and Management), I feel like this is the way for me to go forward. Even though I'm a Computer Science graduate with a First Class, I want to get some Project Manager related qualifications untill I start my Masters.   The first option I thought was Certified ScrumMaster® (CSM®) qualification by Scrum Alliance®  which I'm currently in the process of obtaining. I'm wondering would it be alright to wait couple of months before starting on the Project Management Professional (PMP)® by PMI (US) or start it right away along with CSM?  Also, what else is there to proceed along with these certifications to be qualified and certified as a Technical Project Manager?  Looking forward to your answers.  Thanks in Advance! "
2181,How do you explain the value of a PM to a client?,"I'm sure other PMs have run into this issue, which is explaining the benefit of a PM to a client. Here's a typical question I hear: ""Why am I paying extra for someone who is not involved in the analysis, design, development or support of my project?""  I've come up with a few responses to this:  a. You need someone to make sure each of the project's phases adhere to a certain level of quality  b. You need to talk to someone who is aware of all the phases and of the project's scope (as opposed to talking to 5-6 different people with different communication styes)  c. The PM ensures that the project is delivered on time.   d. Not client-facing responses: a PM allows other team members to focus on their work. The person also manages the budget and scope (what client wouldn't mind a project going out of scope and not having to pay for it?).  I found an excellent and related thread here: What value do project managers provide a software development team?  However, I'm looking to see how other PMs have dealt with this from an external client facing perspective, i.e. how do you relay the benefits to a client directly?  Note: I'd like to add that this hasn't been a problem for larger, complicated projects. But when the stakeholders are few (1 to 2) and the budget isn't that large, this seems to come up more often "
2182,Delegating Work and Dealing with Poor Results?,"One of my weaknesses as a PM is not being able to delegate and manage work assigned to others. What are ways you can tackle this? Granted I have high expectations of others, but sometimes they just don't meet the basic requirements.  Example: I asked someone to do a task for me, and 2 hours before the deadline they present it to me clearly showing no effort was put into it. I had to scramble and re-do it myself. In this scenario, how do you deal with this person? Is there a better way of asking them to do it? How can I enforce it so they do it better next time? "
2183,What is the value of tracking hours in a Sprint burn-down chart?,"The burn down chart will have story points on the Y-Axis and duration (number of days) on the X-Axis. My team is able to complete the stories almost at the end of the Sprint. This means the burn down chart is never linear in relation to the 'ideal working line.' Instead, the actual working line suddenly dips towards the ideal working line almost on the last day of the Sprint.  As a Scrum Master, I am unable to predict if the stories are progressing and getting completed as expected. I read that with the burn-down chart the team is burning hours and the tracking will be based on hours and not story points.   With story points on the Y-Axis and duration (number of days) on the X-Axis, how do I track hours? Secondly, how should I follow the process to make sure that the ideal line and actual line are symmetrical, or close to symmetrical? "
2184,Which would be the best agile approach in order to manage a Process Department?,"I'm in charge of the ""processes and training"" department in my company. Our main activities are:   Document and publish the process of the company as well as procedures and functions of each sector Develop and document efficiency metrics to measure the performance of certain sectors Provide training on demand on various issues, internally and for clients   What would be an appropriate agile way to manage the tasks of such department? How would such way be best implemented in TFS? "
2185,How to Specify how Text Colours Should Override Each Other in MS Project,"This is a little embarrassing, but I cannot figure out how to do this.  I have added Text Style formatting, but I need to change the priority of the formatting.  I have Critical Path tasks formatted to Red, and Milestones to Blue, however, if a task is a milestone and on the critical path, I want it Red.  Is this possible?  Am I missing something really obvious? "
2186,Measuring code productivity between team members,"First question, so here goes!  Between two programmers on the same team, one has produced more code but more defects, whilst the other has produced around 20% less code but significantly less defects by KLOC.  Does established convention (and academic agreement) dictate that the more productive programmer is the first individual? - Defined by his raw output, or can a case be made for the higher quality code? "
2187,Scrum: How should developer promotions be handled in a scrum team?,"We have a scrum team. The developers demand clear guidelines for promotions. AFAIK, there's nothing like defined developer roles for a scrum team but people feel:   People who contribute more should be promoted faster: If someone is moving a fast pace and started contributing to architecture designing, he/she should be promoted to SDE2. Is it good to keep such segregation in a scrum team? Recognition from outside world: Many developers believe that promoted title would help them when they switch job/move to higher studies. Hike with each promotion: Most of them look for zoomed increments along with promotions.    Has anyone faced similar challenge? Any suggestions, how should we deal with this? "
2188,Committing the Product Owner to a sprint backlog with a contract,"A short introduction to the question: I'm a Scrum Master in a small web development organization (10 employees) and we do a lot of projects that'll last for 3 or 4 sprints, with an average duration of 2 months total.  I'm currently in a situation where we actively involve the Product Owner during backlog refinement meetings and sprint plannings, even though some of the companies we work with were hesitant at first because they're not familiar with the Scrum framework. That being said, they were happy to to tag along as it gave them a lot more control of the proces. The problem is: although they know the rules about not changing the sprint backlog during a sprint, most of 'em change the backlog at least once every sprint. Their intentions are good (""we found out a different color works better, change it"" / ""Our client wants to test in browser X today, please make a testing server now"" etc) but they don't seem/want to understand that this will impact the work we can finish during a sprint.  Now we thought it would be a good idea to let the Product Owner sign a sprint release contract, containing key dates, the sprint backlog and definitions of done. While researching scrum theory we kind of assumed the presence of the PO in sprint planning meetings and a verbal agreement to commit to the backlog was enough, but in reality that's not always the case.   My question: is it a good idea to let the PO sign a contract containing the sprint release details? And is there any example of such document in Scrum literature I can reference? "
2189,Standard deviation in JIRA control chart what does it represent?,"Trying to figure out what this represents? If standard deviation is high, does this represent inconsistent productivity? "
2190,How to apply the 'I' of INVEST in UI based development,"As per the 'I'**NVEST philosophy, user stories should be  Independent as it allows for true prioritization of each and every story.  When dependencies come into play it may not be possible to implement a valuable story without implementing other much less valuable stories.  Now as part of my Project we are building a profile page for the user as part of this epic, we have stories for UX design, Front end development(which depends on UX) and then the back-end development(which depends on front-end) creating a dependency in the stories  How do we resolve this issue of Independent  stories in UI based applications where the UX design always informs the development team ?? "
2191,How do you organize/plan your discovery session so that it does not conflict with the work of the current sprint?,"Let's suppose you have a team of 10 developers working on automation (RPA). They are working in 4 different, independent bots.  The PO comes with more opportunities for automation. These opportunities need to be reviewed, sized and an effort estimation need to be provided, i.e. a discovery session is needed.  How do you plan a discovery session for new work items, considering:  1) The PO and involved stake holders and SMEs definitely can not spend more than 1 day on such a session  2) The ideas for automation, based on previous experience, could be completed within 1-2 sprints (1 sprint = 2 weeks)  3) The development team is already busy working in the current sprint  Do you pull some of the devs working in the current sprint to participate on this? How do you handle that? "
2192,Scrum based High-tech Product Development with a very mixed Group (Seniors & Novices),"I'm already a (certified) Scrum Master of a software Development Team and I'm going to/have to establish an agile product development process (Scrum is favored) with another group with four engineers.  Two engineers (PhD level) have been working for years on this very complex software based product. I'd guess you need at least one year to be somewhat productive (though three years may be more accurate).  Now two job starters (directly from university) will join the group. But they will need massive training: one in physics and math, the other one in software engineering and programming.  I already had some discussions with the designated group leader and Product Owner. While appreciating agile ideas, values and practices and Scrum in general, he thinks the idea of a time-boxed Sprint would produce additional stress in the beginning. He would prefer a more event-boxed Sprint (we finished this feature and now we can Sprint until the next feature is done).  I mentioned with this approach he will be missing the important aspect of synchronization in time. But on the other hand the novices will not be able to estimate the smallest feature at all. The designated group leader/Product Owner is willing to switch to a time-boxed sprint after the new group members are trained, productive and cross-functional.  What do you think? Is this possible? What is the best way to establish Scrum in this situation? Is there a better-suited agile process? "
2193,"What is a ""Product Backlog Delta report"" in Scrum?","I'm a student studying game development, While researching into Agile, I kept seeing the term ""Product Backlog Delta report"" Usually in articles pertaining to Scrum.  Upon looking deeper into what that Artifact was I couldn't seem to find a concrete answer, many of my efforts ended up looping back into a standard Product Backlog or a Backlog Burndown.   So my question is, What exactly is a Delta report? and how does it differ from a standard Product Backlog? "
2194,Product Specification for Scrum teams,Do we still create/maintain a copy of a product specifications when subscribed to the Agile/Scrum framework?  I have been tasked to provide a product specification as team members would like to always have an 'overview' of the functionalities/features of the product we are developing.  Does this make sense or do we stick to the product backlog only? 
2195,Should bugs be estimated in story points?,"Should bugs be estimated in story points according to the Scrum methodology?  In particular, what if a bug appears to be a quite complicated task, which in fact is a some missed functionality which has to be added, but it is formally still a bug from the client's point of view? "
2196,Visualizing individuals' efforts with kanban. Is it a wrong approach for measuring the team's throughput?,"I'm new to kanban and agile as such but I'm really positive and enthusiastic and I have a clean vision of it's potential for us. I made a decision to start off with a first board and take it from there. Let's visualize and understand ourselves...  I always thought that the development work in the company I work in is a pure CHAOS. Dozens of small (10 - 30min) to medium sized projects/requests thrown at you on a daily basis from a range of (6) product managers / directors of a sort + direct request from customers + customer services girls and data team having their issues.  Priorities change every second day with super urgent tasks requested for end of play tomorrow.  There is 6 of us in the team and each one has got his own niche overlapping each other only from time to time. There is no such thing as testing the software before deployment.  The developer is pretty much responsible for delivering a working piece of software.  Bug fixing and maintanance is part of the job (actually it's probably more than 50% of the job unfortunatelly). Big projects just take ages to complete and tend to generate a great backlog. There is never time for automation, however hard we try and whatever good ideas we have. Technical directors were not helping us (3 of them in the last 5 years).  We are self-organized fire-fighting chaos. Thank God there are still 2 people who's been building the product from the very beginning (8 years ago) - me being one of them. It would be critical otherwise.  Last month I've read Personal Kanban by Jim Benson and I knew it's it. I knew I've got to try it ASAP with my team. You just can't get it wrong, can you? ToDo, Doing (55), Done and bang - you've got board with WIP limit, you can see the flow, you can improve it. Then I was polishing my vision and couldn't fit the board to match us. I just couldn't find the common denominator for each and every team member.  There is no such thing as quota for us - the task tend to be thrown directly to the junior developer (by the technical director) etc.  Today was the day when I drew my first kanban board in the office. And I can say I'm not too happy with it. I've done something that I feel is slightly wrong, but I stuck to the idea. This is what I've done:  Backlog | Ready (6) | Who |  Today  | Doing (2) | Pen | Done      |         | Bob |         |           |     |            |         | -----------------------------------------     |         | Rod |         |           |     |            |         | -----------------------------------------     |         | Jay |         |           |     |            |         | -----------------------------------------     |         | Jim |         |           |     |          The first main reason I've drawn it like that was that this is basically how we work:). The second main reason why I've done it this way is because I don't know how we work.  I don't have a clue how many small maintanance 15-minutes jobs we're doing on a weekly/monthly basis and how does it relate to the new features that are improving the product. I don't know where the job is usually coming from and what are the 'classes of service' distribution or who is the best multitasker etc.  So I have also itroduced a rather-sophisticated post-it notes system with 7 different class of service (different colours and shapes) and some extra bits to be added on the very card (like the source of the task). I thought that it can't be wrong this way. I'm visualising the work. Not so much I've limited the WIP (it's limited to 2 tasks for each member on the doing column; also the Ready column is limited to 6 tasks - for better planning), but I'm going to focus on completing the once started tasks and limiting the multitask switches (what I have identified as the number one disease that's killing us).  The kanban system will evolve, I'm sure of that.   But the goal I want to achieve is to measure the our team's throughput.  I'm planning to go with the board measuring individuals' efforts for 4 weeks or so. I want to  identify and understand the input interface. I want to learn about the efficiency of each members on particulart tasks etc. I need to understand what percentage of the throughput is used for maintanance and bug fixing. Only then I will be able to make a really big step towards improving the process (and not only among the dev team, but a bit higher too).  So, is that a really bad approach? Can you suggest an alternative one? Perhaps it would just be better concentrating on the team effort as a whole from the day 0 and measure the input interface on the team level. "
2197,Using acceptance criteria and scenarios with BDD,"TL;DR: We use rule-oriented and scenario-oriented acceptance criteria for test definition and clarity. Is this OK?  I am seeing more and more descriptions of stories where the user scenarios or bullet pointed acceptance criteria are used, but not both. E.g.:   [website][website]We use the scenarios to define what is required as functional change and for automated test definitions.  We use bullet pointed acceptance criteria to define yes/no human pass/fail conditions in as concise terminology as possible.  Having read this post I would like to know if it is appropriate to use both acceptance criteria and Scenarios in the same Behaviour-Driven Development stories?  I do it this way (as the Scrum Master) because it is how I was raised (in Agile) though I admit to finding difficulty in describing 'how to write bullet acceptance criteria' for my team. "
2198,How can I schedule resources across multiple projects?,"Drawing from the body and comments of a previous question, what is the best way to schedule simultaneous projects and resources to those projects?  For example, in a group of 16 staff, each working on multiple projects, each with an iteration cycle of ~2 weeks, how can I see what people are working on what NOW, so that I can effectively utilize staff across all projects we may have and reduce idle time on the whole team? "
2199,Historical query results & date by which items entered scope (or fixVersion),"In JIRA, it is possible to ask JQL queries based on the current values of fields, such as date created, date modified, etc. With the ScriptRunner plugin, even more fun date-based queries are possible.  However, is there a way to obtain, for a given query AND a given date, the result of that query as if run on that date? JIRA keeps full history of changes, so in principle that should be possible, but after perusing all documentation for JIRA and Scriptrunner, I haven't found a way to build such a query.  The immediate application for me is to construct release burndowns for arbitrary scopes (which are represented as a query). A good proxy for what I want would be also to find out by which date an item was assigned to a fixVersion (thus entering the scope).  I suppose more approaches could be considered - if not JQL, then maybe querying the REST interface? Or is the only method to query the JIRA DB itself?  I will be grateful for any help from experienced JIRA power-users. "
2200,Allowing additions to a running sprint in Scrum,"If I am not wrong, Scrum groups user stories into sprints so the team focuses its resources to complete as much user stories as possible.  How flexible is the sprint planning according to Scrum ?, in theory a sprint should not allow to add new user stories to a running sprint, right ?, but what happens when an organization is doing both, implementing the product and developing the product's concept at the same time ?  For example, if business teams need to do experiments, which require the addition of new user stories to be implemented in a middle of a sprint, and such tasks should be released as soon as possible, for example if it is possible on the same day.   If the experiments do not compromise sprint planning from resources point of view, in fact there could be a ""free developer"" just focused on these business experiments, the integration of the experiment results could be merged into the project as tasks for the next sprint.  So, back to the question. Does Scrum consider situations like these or are there any other agile methodology that consider these and provides approaches to manage them ? "
2201,"Former employer wants to collaborate on commercialising internal software, what is reasonable commission?","The basic scenario is that my former employer has been approached by another company who wish to license some software I wrote for them while I was in their employ and have approached me to work with them on making the changes required to commercialise this software (it is currently very specific to my former employer's environment and systems, so some work is required to change this).  My former employer is not a software company and has no software developers of their own so this is strictly a side-project for them as well.  I am currently in full time work elsewhere so anything I do will be in my own time at evenings or weekends. They have suggested a commission deal whereby I get a commission on every sale, which I am fine with. I expect there will be a maximum of 100 hours of work required prior to first sale.  We have still to work out details of who supports the customers, I certainly have no intention of being first line support!  My question is how do I go about working out what sort of commission is reasonable in this scenario? What factors need to be taken in to account? "
2202,"Is a zigzag, sawtooth velocity a problem if the trend is consistent?","I am supporting and coaching several scrum teams working on different areas of the same software project.  Sprints are 4 weeks long, except that sprints spanning the Christmas/New Year holidays are 5 weeks long.  (The first six or so sprints were 3 weeks, before the teams decided to change them to 4.)  All of the teams' velocities have a very noticeable pattern of zigzagging, where velocity alternates between higher and lower values every single sprint.  In the graphs below, the Y axis is points Done per sprint; the gray lines are 10 story points.  Each team has an independent backlog and estimates its own stories, so while points are not consistent between teams they are consistent within teams.  In raw numbers one team completes twice the points of the other teams, so the graphs are normalized across teams under the assumption that each team's average velocity is equivalent, to prevent ""point competition"".   The teams explain this variation as having mostly Done stories carry over to the next sprint, so that some sprints finish fewer stories and other sprints finish more.  Teams typically commit to a third or a half more points than they actually finish, and many of these extra points are ""In Development"" at the end of each sprint.  Developers are resistant to smaller stories or shorter sprints as they ""wouldn't have time to finish anything"" and ""would always be in Scrum meetings"".  This is related to Team velocity fluctuates a lot, how to find the root cause?, but I think it is a much more specific issue.  From those answers, I considered impediments and unbalanced work as possible explanations, but they aren't enough by themselves to cause this extreme zigzagging.  Turnover on the teams is low and much of the velocity variation has occurred during periods of stability.    1) Have you seen such consistent zigzag patterns in velocity on your teams?  2) Does this pattern suggest a problem?  3) If so, what is the problem, how it is harmful, and how is it correctable?   "
2203,How many user stories per project?,So in an interview recently I had a company ask me to estimate how many user stories my team used per project on average. I had no idea how to answer this. Is there an average out there or an answer? Technically couldn't the answer be anywhere from 1 - infinite?  
2204,Print on Demand Project Setup - General Questions,"I am setting up a small Print-On-Demand shop project and just want to ask if my way of handling all the transactions is okay, what would you improve, what would you do different.  Techstack:   Hosting: Netlify   Frontend: Gatsby + React   Customizing Print in the Client: Paper.js Checkout: Snipcart  Printing: Printful  API Backend/OrderLogistics/Database: Express.js + MongoDB + Netlify Lambda Functions   So the general process is:   User visits website and edits a design to his liking. The editing options are rather limited, the custom design in displayed via Paper.js User clicks ""Checkout Now""-Button Clientside generates SVG from the Paper.js canvas and the svg + all customization parameters are sent to backend  Backend stores everything in DB with a unique id Unique id is sent back to client Snipcart client process is started User enters shipping + payment data and confirms purchase Payment is processed by Snipcart, unique id + shipping info is sent to Snipcart via API Snipcart calls backend webhook when the payment is completed transmitting unique it + shipping info Backend looks up design in database based on unique id and builds product in Printful API Printful creates order I manually doublecheck snipcart backend + printful order, look if everything is as expected and if so confirm the order Product is shipped by printful   I know it is hard to say much about the process without seeing the actual implementation, but just from the basic steps is there anything I should do completely different?   Thank you in advance :-)  Edit: Is this - and if not so: What is a good place to ask this kind of questions? "
2205,Why a project manager isn't an entrepreneur?,It's interesting for me to know the differences between a project manager and an entrepreneur?   Whet does an entrepreneur has that a project manager hasn't and why should a project manager work under an entrepreneur in the organization chart?  EDIT: If someone explains the key tasks of each one and the key differences i will get my answer! 
2206,What level of analysis should the development team expect before being asked to estimate and develop a story?,"Here is an example of s story that recently made its way into a timebox.  As an Ecommerce Executive, I want to make improvements to the Request a Callback form which will make it easier to segment the callback request by purpose.   Can the customer select their reason for requesting a callback?  Can the customer specify whether they are a new or existing customer?  Is the form dynamic?  Does it reflect the design and copy attached? Has the old 'Visual Website Optimizer' code been replaced with the following 'Optimizely' code:    I believe that developers and testers have a responsibility to work out the detail of stories with whatever business representatives are available and I enjoy that part of my role.  However, I am left feeling a bit like I did all the analysis.  The last point in the acceptance criteria is part of another story and was completely unrelated.    Here is what the owner of the story actually desired (actually I believe there should maybe be two stories here)  As an E-commerce Executive, I want to capture and send information to the Telephone Provider for MI purposes so that I have improved granularity in the MI reports.   Can the customer select if they are an existing or new customer?  Can the customer select the product they require a callback for?  Can the customer select the reason that they require a callback for?  Are the available reasons available dependent on the product selected and whether the customer is existing or new?  Are the selected reasons sent to the provider?   As a Sales Manager, I want to route telephone calls to a specific call handling team depending on how the customer has completed the Request a Callback form so that the customer is dealt with by a suitable call handler.   If the customer is calling about Product X, is the new Product X route I have created sent to the provider?  If the customer is an existing customer, is the new Existing Customer route I have created sent to the provider for all products excluding Product X?  If the customer is a new customer, is the new Existing Customer route I have created sent to the provider for all products excluding Product X?   Even with the second stories, the developer an tester will still have to talk to a business representative to flesh out the exact detail.  I believe this is a good thing as it allows a certain level of negotiation in order to get the best solution.    I believe the original story is difficult if not impossible to reasonanly estimate.  I also believe that it can lead to disagreements to as when the story is 'done', leading to under/over delivering.  We have raised story quality at every retrospective for a long time, but in the view of the developers\testers the story quality hasn't improved.   With regards to my example:  Are my colleagues and I falling into the trap of wanting too much defined up front or is the first story under analysed?  What level of detail\analysis should the team expect before being asked to estimate and develop the story?   "
2207,Why four levels of defect severity?,"When looking around for examples of how five levels of defect severity are named it turned out that almost everybody seem to use four levels of severety (they name them differently though).  Is there a rational reason for this? Any fact that says that this is actually the best thing to do?  Or is it just that everybody does this because everybody else does it? Which means that it's a reasonable idea to (go against the flow and) use five levels instead.  As I mentioned I've got no great idea what to call these five levels (perhaps critical, major, medium, minor, trivial or something). The idea is that the highest of course is catastrophic/critical/blocker (ie something that we simply can't stand or nearly so) then the lower would be geometrically smaller in expected impact. Where it ends is when the expected impact is too low to bother about.  "
2208,Resource time not allocating correctly in Project 2013,"I'm planning a project where I want my resources to dedicate one day week each to project work.  I've created a calendar for each resource which blocks out their day, so there are Tuesday only, Thursday only, and Friday only calendars.  There's one resource assigned to each calendar at 100%; resource Rob is also assigned to the Friday only calendar, but at only 50%.  The project is set to auto-schedule new tasks and to treat tasks as Fixed Work.  What I want to see is that the first available resource uses all his available hours, so if a task were set to 12 hours of work, the first resource (say the Tuesday one) would do 7 hours of work on it, then the Thursday resource would pick up the remaining 5, and the Friday resources would never actually be utilized.  There are two problems I'm having, illustrated by this screenshot:     Referring to task BRV, why are Bill and Marty never assigned during the second week?  Ideally, they'd work on the task on Monday and Tuesday, leaving only a few hours on left to be done on March 13.  Why is Project skipping over Bill and Marty's available days on the 2nd Tuesday and Thursday?  Also, for the few hours that should be left on March 13, is there a way to tell Project ""always assign Dylan to 100% of  his available time before assigning anything to Rob""? Referring to the CDR task, why are Bill and Marty not assigned a full 7 hours each, but Dylan is assigned to work a full 8 after them?  "
2209,How to make user stories independent in multi-discipline teams,"When there is a team which has multiple disciplines such as designers, artists and programmers. How should user stories be written to make them independent?  Example: ""As a user, I want a beautiful and an easy to use UI for searching results""  That story requires design to make the UI easy to use and it requires artists to make it beautiful. But also it has to be programmed to actually work.  It can't be done one after another. If an artist concepts the UI by herself, it might not be as usable as the UI designer wanted. And it might not be even implementable by the programmer.  So far it has been done by sub-tasking the story to feature all these disciplines and what each discipline needs to do before it is done. But it is easily left hanging if one discipline is blocked from completing it e.g getting ill.  If making stories independent is not possible, how should multi-discipline stories be handled? "
2210,Long running story,"TL;DR: Genuinely long running story drags from sprint to sprint. What to do?  We have a story which is taking a long time to complete because of the various external factors involved.  Each sprint does gain some progress on the story but it is clear that it will not get far in a reasonably short period of time.  The point estimate on the story is average for our team and the story is not blocked.  As the external factors can only make practical progress on the story every few days the story is stuck in the Development column somewhat.  What should be done with this story?  I have considered converting the work into a RAID item. I am not sure that this is appropriate. Assume that it is not.  For those interested...  The story is genuinely taking a long time because it involves code being developed for an environment in a far-off country. The required process to dev-test the code involves a round-the-house trip through multiple time zones and slow-to-respond resources. Very much a human thing, but also impacted by needing some evidence gathering of values which take days to collect. (Like if the task were physically measuring continental drift.) "
2211,What are the alternatives to Project Management? Is it Operations Management?,"Since there is not other SE-community on management I ask this here, but I am happy to be guided somewhere else.  Even though there a different definitions of what a project is, they all have in common that projects have a start and an ending. But for example working in or managing retail does not necessarily fit into this description (since it is a continuous process).  Is there an equally organised community of managers who do not work as project managers? How do the good practices differ from project management?  What is the umbrella term for non-project management? Does there exist a PMBOK-syle reference guide for this kind of management? "
2212,Are there (IEEE) standards for project management,"I was told by my project lead today, that he had received a certificate in project management and that he had written a project proposal according to some given rules but he wasn't really able to specify which rules in particular he followed. It seems to be called a project charter. But is this really a standard?  He suggested that a project couldn't be called a project, unless it was actually specified/defined like in the document that he handed over to me. It seemed to follow some template indeed, and the overall structure seemed nice.  But anyway, my questions are:  1) Does certificate actually exist in the field of project management. If yes what are they?  2) Is there any standards out there (maybe defined by IEEE) that would define what a project is (how it should be defined, etc.?).  3) Where could I learn about project definition and management. I am not interested in some sort of books written by people who feel they've been successful in running a project and want to share their recipes with others. I can do this on my own. I am more looking for ""objective"", more formal, standardised approaches to the problem. "
2213,What to do with the Sprint backlog tasks that we have decided are not needed any more,"Can anybody answer my question here? I have estimated for 5 to 6 tasks like analysis (4 hrs), design (3 hrs), logical review (1 hr), peer review (1 hr), unit testing (1 hr), coding (2 hrs) and release (1 hr). But during analysis itself I came to know that rest of the activity will not be applicable. In this scenario, should I make the hours zero for all the tasks that have become obsolete or should I delete the tasks? "
2214,"How to put regular ""post to facebook"" tasks in MS-Project?","I'm new to project management, among other tasks our company has decided to post messages to social media regularly. Say we want to post every week, how would you write these tasks in MS-Project?  Post to Facebook   - write  - design graphics  - post  - analyze    It is more like a 'to do list'. How do I just write this group of tasks as recurring task (say every Monday)? And is this the best way to do this?   "
2215,Actions to improve Scrum Restrospective,"Which actions could be done in the Retros (- or, how could I guide the Retro) to turn the ceremony more attractive to the Dev Team? Lately we've been just collecting what should be improved + what went well in the previous sprints, and this seems to easily turn the ceremony boring.  Would you have inputs on what could be done to turn this moment into something that could make the team more open/focused to give deeper/better inputs? "
2216,How to repay technical debt still delivering features?,"The picture I saw far too many times over my career. A team of developers in a company driven by non-technical management, practising scrum, severely pressured to deliver points and features by certain deadline therefore having no chance to concentrate on quality or dealing with technical debt. Not many developers if at all understand what is going on in depth of code, tests coverage is not sufficient so any attempt of refactoring anything leads to bunch of regressions. It takes more and more time for a frustrated team to add a feature and then even more time to figure out why this feature broke the product in several places and how to fix it without breaking in further.  Management understands that something is not right and hires a new head of dev expecting him to bring improvements resulting in more features delivered quicker. It is usually very difficult to explain to management that it will take time to repay technical debt and that the team will be even slower refactoring rather than delivering features.  What is usually the best strategy with that? Are there any links on success stories?  "
2217,Edit the wbs column in microsoft project / import wbs + indent tasks,"I sometimes use Freemind in the early startup process of projects for brainstorming with the project team. With freemind, it is possible to save the mindmap as an ODT file which then creates a WBS for all tasks.   I would like to use this WBS in Microsoft project without having to manually indent tasks as subtasks.   So: instead of marking all created activities i would like to copy/paste or import and get the hierarcy at start - as created from freemind export.  Freemind gives me:   Activity 1   1.1 Activity 2  1.1 Activity 3  1.1.1 Activity 4  1.2 Activity 5  ... and so on.   Is this possible? Does anyone have experience importing pre-made WBS hierarcies for MS Project? List item Are there any alternative scheduling applications that I should look into with this possibility?   Best regards, Pär "
2218,How to model extended period of 'searching for product' tasks in MS-Project?,"We run a sale of second hand goods from clients. We would set a target say 200 items this season and start contacting people we know who have items they want to sell. We would spend about 2 months doing this, then for each item we bring back to office, we need to check, research and photograph it. Then we would design and publish a sale catalogue.  How would you model this in MS-Project? Should I have a summary task that's 2 month long? But then there is no point creating 200 sub-tasks for each item. How could this be represented in MS-Project in a meaningful and useful way to track my team's progress? "
2219,How would company management work as a set of products?,"Background: A small tech company has just grown from a flat startup team of 8 developers with no real structure to ca. 40 people (roughly 20 devs + 20 various business and management positions), who need to work in teams and have clearly defined resources and priorities. The company uses agile terms (like a Product Owner and Backlog), but few people have read more about it than the Agile Manifesto. A position of Agile Coach is open, but nobody is hired for it yet.    Situation: The CTO pushes forward a product-oriented structure for the whole company. While the devs had no problem defining what their 3 Products are and how to deliver them, the management used a literal approach: ""If a Product is anything with a backlog and features, and a backlog is a list of my tasks, then my tasks are my Product."" As a result, the marketing team has a product ""Company webpage"" and a product ""Brand development"", while the office manager has 3 products: ""Office management in City A"",  ""Office management in City B"", and ""Travel Booking.""  Question: Are there any dangers or side effects of defining company management as a set of products? If no, how to organize this work in the most effective way? And if yes, how to define what could and could not be a product?  "
2220,Software development process for a product like MS-Office,What is the best or most suitable software development process to follow when developing products like Microsoft Office product (has no specific client)? and Why?   Could it be Waterfall? or a modified one?  Could it be an agile software development method?   
2221,Who determines task dependency?,"Say two tasks, A and B, have a F-S (finish-start) dependency, who actually decides this is the case?  Probably not the greatest example, but here's one: During software development, let's say the development team decides they want the front-end interface to be developed after the design.   During execution, the customer says that these two tasks don't need to have a F-S dependency. The customer then says that the ""code base"" can be started without needing the designs as reference.  How are these discussions avoided? If they do occur, how is the schedule to be updated? "
2222,Scrum when each member has their own product,"I work in a team of 15 that implements scrum (as well as we can). Each person in the team has multiple products, that only they work on, and each of those products are unrelated to any other product on the team. However, put everything into one backlog to facilitate scrum.  We have a scrum master that leads the team, but no product owner (because there are so many products all unrelated, each member is responsible for their own backlogs).  We have noticed in daily stand ups that while it's good to catch up, whenever you are not speaking, the products you are hearing about from other members have nothing to do with your own work, and there isn't a single product that has more than one member working on it.  I would like to ask if it sounds like we should even be using scrum? If so - are there any ways we can make our standups and sprints more relevant for each member?  Thanks "
2223,Finding a decent Development Team,"hope this isn't out of the concept, I couldn't find any place better to ask. Me and my friend are working on a social networking app idea but we both don't know enough coding to develop that big of an app. We decided to hire a development team, approximately around 5-10 developers, which has developers for both frontend and backend development, and also which has designers for UI design and stuff. The problem is, I've been trying to find such team on oDesk and Elance but I can't trust those people, I don't know why. I have limited budget (enough for a prototype app, then I'm planning to try to get some investment or loan). Do any of you know a decent development team that fulfills my qualifications? Or can any of you give me some advice on what should I do? I'd really appreciate any help. Thanks. "
2224,Should we create multiple stories for same thing to be replicated at code level?,"We have a page with the same content at 2 places. Since we are running with legacy code and due to some previously made bad decisions, we have duplicated the logic twice for the same thing. Both the pages are running on different technologies.  Now if some changes/enhancement come to this, should we create two stories for this OR just one? And should we estimate it considering it would require duplicate effort OR it should be estimated as if its a code at just one common place? "
2225,Should Daily Scrum meetings be held in the morning or the afternoon?,"I was used to morning Daily scrum meetings (after 30/60 mins of work), but currently we are conducting meetings after 6 hours of work. I think this approach has the advantage of focusing on the problems the team members have encountered when they answer the ""Are there any impediments in your way?"" question. I believe that this is the most important of the three questions that the team members answer.  What is the best part of the day to have the Daily Scrum meetings, in the morning or afternoon? "
2226,Sizing user stories that need external input,"Sometimes, when sizing user stories, the team says ""but in order to do this, we need to ask this guy, and we don't know how long it will take for them to answer"", or ""we need to raise a ticket to (A) and (B), after we have done this, and then wait for them to proceed, in order to complete our job"". I am talking about dependencies, sometimes in the form of communication, some others in the form of an action from an external team.   I know that a user story should be INVEST, in this case, independent. What is your suggestion to such user stories though? Should we define in the DoD that if it has dependencies, then we try to break them first, and then size it? Or sizer it, factoring in the external dependencies / impediments? "
2227,Production bugs and epics in Jira,"We are trying to organize our epics in a better way. In the past, the epics remained indefinitely open on Jira. Every production support/bug ticket will be added to the exsiting epic. However, since we use epics to track our roadmap (basically we have plugin that shows the epics timeline and what is active right now. It is very useful to give a big picture, since we have many epics), the indefinitely open epics render this roadmap useless.   We decided to close the epic, once all issues in that epic are closed. The problem now is, where to place production bugs/support tickets if the relevant epic is closed? If we add them to their respective epic, we will be back to keep th epic always open, which we do not want. If we do not assign them under any epic, it will be hard to track the support effort that resulted from certain epics.  Anyone faced such a problem? "
2228,How formal is the sprint planning?,As far as I understand during the sprint planning meeting the team choose the backlog items that will be included in the sprint.  How formal is the sprint planning and task assignments? Once the sprint starts is normal to use PMBOK artifacts such as a project charter and a WBS to guide the sprint or the development team decide what to do on the go?  P.D. I only have a basic knowledge of scrum. I would like to apologize in advance if I am  constructing this question wrong! 
2229,Is it possible to do project budgeting within TFS?,"I am working for a software company. We are using Microsoft Team Foundation Server (TFS) for our development workflow and it works very well. Now my boss wants to get an overview of the project budget, including the hourly rates of the employees and the stage of completion of the project integrated into Team Foundation Server.  Is it possible to do this within a stock TFS implementation, or does it require third-party software? For example, is it possibile to edit the process templates in TFS to save and maintain this data? "
2230,Should management review the scrum metrics of scrum teams?,"I read somewhere that team's velocity, burn-up chart, and other scrum indicators are only for team's internal purpose.   Should anyone outside the team i.e. from management review the team's chart and analyze why they failed/succeeded in the last sprint?  What could be pros and cons of such management review of scrum metrics by management? "
2231,QA time budgetting,"I am currently preparing a proposal to a client for a large web application development. My environment is outsourced software development. I need to budget QA time for the project.  Usually, from practice, I used a mix of the following:   Base case scenario: QA estimated at 15% of the development team time. With some percentage point changes based on the mix of juniors and seniors as well as back-end to front-end tasks. Usually front-end and junior - make more QA needs. Whereas back-end and seniors - make less.  Commercial considerations. There are more often than not, very down-to-earth considerations in terms of time utilization.   Questions:   Is QA budgeted 15% of dev time an industry standard?  I always had the impression it was. But recently someone challenged this in a discussion putting the number higher.  Is there a smarter way? Some more sophisticated drivers than the ones I use. Any article to link on the matter?   Thanks! "
2232,Project Management in bad times - demoralized people and loss of power,"I'm a Software Project Manager currently facing a hard situation: our company is having some hard times (mainly due to financial things) and lately people are generally pessimistic, apathic and/or easily angered.  Generally, I have a very strict and hard management style: I point out mistakes and fix them ASAP, raise warning flags and resolve small conflicts with a strong intervention so they cannot grow bigger.  However, as my developers are getting more demotivated due to the things happening I am starting to lose my ""leverage power"". People suddenly started to hate to be corrected, became less dedicated to delivery quality and delivering good quality becomes really hard for projects.  What approach is best for me to take up in such situation? Lately I became slighly softer when I interact with everyone and I try explaining bad things with a calm and humble manner but this only barely buys time. I feel like I need a major strat change.  Have you had such experiences? How did you overcome them? What has worked and what not?  EDIT: If I look back in the history, good leaders had dealt with hard times by establishing even stricter rules. (to the very contrary of the humble soft PMs graduated various funny unversities nowadays). But I am afraid if I do this some people might resign (considering the bad background and the better choices they might have).  Thank you. :) "
2233,How to best conduct and document agile retrospective meetings?,"I have worked in organisations that used either one of the following approaches during a retrospective meeting to gather feedback and reflect on how the agile team is doing and to explore ways to improve:   First approach:       “Start”, “stop” or ""Continue""      Using this approach each team member is asked to identify specific   things that the team should:         Start doing   Stop doing   Continue doing      Second approach:       What went well and not so well?   Using this approach team feedback focuses only in these two areas and team feedback is captured as follows:   1-  Capture feedback in excel sheet   2-  Team Vote  3-  Tackle highest voted items ""in what didn't go so well""  4-  Decide on actions    Which approach to use:  Using the “Start”, “stop” and “Continue” approach, the retrospectives meeting seem to take longer time but does provide substantially more feedback. However, documenting the outcome is a bit problematic because the list of items (particularly the “start”) keeps growing!   Using ""What went well and not so well"" approach the outcome of the retrospective meeting seems to be more focused but less rich.  I understand that a combination of these two approaches is perhaps possible by starting the retrospective with:  What went we’ll and not so well! Followed by “Start”, “stop” and “Continue”. I haven’t tried it before. So I have a couple of questions:  1. Has anyone used a combined approach and how successful was this?  2. What are best practices when it comes to documenting retrospective meetings with both these approaches and with a combined approach? "
2234,What is the process of schedule management with clients who aren't very responsive?,"Here's the scenario: The main point of contact was fairly active up until the project came close to the launch date. At that point, the client started to miss the dates for requirements that were needed for the next set of tasks.  What is the process for managing the schedule in this case?  Say, to do X, we need Y. Client needs to provide Y on Jan 15.  What does the PM do on Jan 16 assuming Y was not provided the day earlier?  Going forward, would communication issues like these go into the Risk Register? "
2235,How to estimate time for a project needing skills only a new hire has?,"I have a little new company that works with robotics, machine vision and natural language processing. But for some projects, we need to write some Android/iOS applications. In our company we don't have smartphone programming experience! So I don't know how to calculate how much time is needed for an Android program.  Maybe you say you can ask for that from many developers and find the average time, but the problem is that I don't know which developer really has enough experience or if he/she lied to get the job! Are there any rules or guides to do that?  In general I want to know, if I hire a programmer, how fast should I expect him/her to work? How much work should I expect he/she does in a day or week? "
2236,Are Gantt Charts useful for single-person projects?,"Occasionally,  I've been asked to produce a Gantt chart for a project.  A lot of the time, I was the only person assigned to that project. This mostly happened back when I was a student, though my coworker is currently in this position.  To my understanding, a Gantt-chart is used for planning out which tasks your resources (usually people) are going to be assigned to at a particular time. This also allows me to define the critical path, and get a sense of the time estimate of the project (e.g. if Bob has 3 tasks that each will take a day, I know that I need at least 3 days to get that part done. Or I can swap in Steve and Alice to do one of the tasks each to get it done in 1 day, but I have to pay 3 salaries).  Subsequently, if I'm creating a Gantt-chart for a project only containing me, it seems a little pointless. Surely everything is on the critical path. I can't do task 1 and 2 at the same time, even if task 1 and 2 have no other resources (apart from me) in common. If they do have some pre-requisite, then all the Gantt-chart will do is nail down the ordering.   By and large, I'm just writing down all the tasks that need to be done in some linear order. At this point, surely I can just have a table of dates and tasks? What value is a Gantt-chart adding for me here?  When presented with something that doesn't make sense, I assume it's me that's misunderstanding something. So: Are Gantt Charts useful for single-person projects? How?  Edit: To clarify, I understand the point of a schedule. I have a little planner that has the tasks next to the deadlines (both external and self-imposed). I also can make time estimates of the tasks (so I know I can't start task B until next Monday because I'm doing task A until then). I could, if requested, produce a Gantt-chart from my to-do list, but it's not going to help organise anything: I'd just have a wall-poster of the stuff I've already got in the planner. "
2237,"After running visual report from Project 2010, why can't I modify the pivot table data?",I am running the Earned Value Over Time visual report from MS Project 2010 and would like to  accumulate baseline cost for multiple baselines in Excel.  Since the Excel pivot table is linked to the .cub file that Project exports it won't allow me to modify the table data.  My plan was to add a column and use DAX or formula to accumulate the baseline cost fields but it won't allow any modification.  Does anyone know how to get it to allow modification?  Or a way to accumulate costs for multiple baselines?  The end goal is to see our original cumulative baseline cost against the current or other baselines we have taken. 
2238,Misunderstandings about Collective Ownership in an Agile environment,"From my understanding collective ownership will solve common problems with the antiquated such as quality, failure due to absence and knowledge-sharing.  However, there are some things that I don't understand.   Is the team a democracy? If so, what if the majority are wrong? Why choose technical correctness over ""people correctness""? i.e. What's technically correct may not be most motivational/enjoyable choice for the people working on the project. An unhappy team is more likely to create bad quality than a motivated team. What about the individual's creativity, understanding, exploration and experimentation? These are likely to be neglected if the only decisions that get made are based on a mutual agreement. How is rogue activity handled? For example, if 99% of a project is done and the entire team except one person goes on holiday the next day, what stops that one person from changing things that were already agreed on during pair programming sessions, just before delivering the last 1%? Won't code production time be massively increased? If the entire team has to learn all code that gets produced then technically only one thing can be produced at a time.   Edit: Added point 4 and 5. "
2239,Kurt Lewin's 3 stage change process: which stage has the most resistance?,"Is there in Kurt Lewin's 3 stage change process (Wiki) any ""resistance distribution"" or all stages have nearly equal resistance level? If so, which stage actually has the most resistance level? "
2240,Example epics and themes for website project,"Can there be any crossover between themes and the epics/stories inside them.  For example, i think 'Frontend' would make a good theme for a website project.  However some stories within this theme might belong to other themes i.e.  Frontend (theme)     - Homepage (epic)         - Carousel (story)             - Backend development to load carousel images (task)             - Layout and styling of carousel (task)   Obviously the backend task stands out as being in the wrong place.  However, having the frontend theme would mean that the backend task needs to go into another hierarchy, right?  Backend (theme)     - Homepage (epic)         - Carousel (story)             - Backend development to load carousel images (task)   and  Frontend (theme)     - Homepage (epic)         - Carousel (story)             - Layout and styling of carousel (task)   Messy.  How would this normally be structured?  Is homepage the the theme or still an epic but no theme? "
2241,Is creating mock-ups a good idea when starting to develop a new project?,"I'm designing my first Android App, and I find it very hard to actually understand what my system should actually do. I have a general Idea but when I try to tell it to others I fail to communicate what is it that the system will do.   I've written specs and created three different scenarios for different potential users and it helped me understand the main purpose of this app. I've also found that creating mock-ups gave me a better perspective of the system's objective. I've also noticed that while creating these mock-ups I focus mainly on how the app should look rather than what it should do.   I would like to now if it is a good idea to rely on GUI (Graphical User Interface) mock-ups as a way to start building a system from scratch. Will doing so help me identify classes/objects/interfaces? Will it help (when unclear) to better define the scope of the system? Is mock up building a good tool to rely on when trying to understand a new project's scope? Are there any other, better tools or steps to take when the overall goal is unclear?  "
2242,Should Scrum meetings be held in one day or two days?,"I was asked an interesting question to which I do not have a strict answer. I would only have suggestions, thus I'd like to ask you the same question:  How do you believe regular scrum meetings should be handled when it comes to time? Say you have 2-week long sprints, then in theory:  Planning - 4 hours max Review - 2 hours max Retro - 1,5 hours max  Now the sequence for me is clear -> Sprint Planning -> Sprint Review -> Sprint Retrospective.   Question is -> should this all happen in one day (of course given the fact that it may be shorter - planning 1 hour, review 1 hour, retro 1,5 hour)?   The benefits from such distribution in my opinion are that by having all these meetings in one day we have rest of the time in sprint for working on user stories, project discussions, backlog refining activities etc - regular work.  However - spending whole day on meetings may cause them to be ineffective and the team to be less active and Scrum ideas may be lost.  Splitting them into two days again makes two days a bit less productive when it comes to regular work, however team should be able to benefit more from higher activity during meetings.  My idea is there is no strict answer and one should keep in mind context of the team, PO, project etc and adapt it to fit best what the team needs.   What are your opinions? "
2243,Agile Artifacts,"Do Agile projects have Charters, project plans and baselines?  How to obtain the classical artifacts (which are necessary to report back to the business) in an Agile environment which focuses on delivery? "
2244,"What is the framework ""escape hatch"" for a SAFe ART that is running down the wrong track?","Handling Incipient Failures in SAFe  In Scrum, there is the notion of Cancelling a Sprint and returning to Sprint Planning if the Sprint Goal becomes obsolete, or if the iteration plan is so far off base that scope can't be renegotiated without obviating the current Sprint Goal. However, I can find no parallel mechanism in SAFe 4.x that provides a similar escape hatch.  Given a Program Increment (PI) with goals that teams discover can't be met during the course of the PI, or Sprints/iterations within a PI that need to be replanned (not just re-scoped), what is the framework mechanism for doing so? While you're allowed to renegotiate scope in SAFe, sometimes that isn't enough to actually meet a goal; sometimes objectives or plans need to change, too!  Obviously teams can replan at iteration boundaries within a PI. There are also opportunities to introspect issues and improve planning in the future during the Inspect and Adapt (I&amp;A) or Innovation and Planning (IP) cycles in SAFe. However, the notion that the Agile Release Train (ART) just keeps chugging along, even once it's discovered that the train is headed full-steam down the wrong track, seems fundamentally wrong to me. What have I missed or misunderstood about this aspect of the framework? "
2245,How to write recommendation documentation?,"I was asked to prepare an overview of an existing IT architechture and provide a document that consists of weaknesses analysis and suggestions on how each of the weak spots can be improved.   How to make this document simple to read, not overloaded and specific at the same time? Is there a template I can use for this kind of documentation?    Also, should I provide a description of how a specific segment in the system currently works before I put explanation about what should be changed?   Thank you  "
2246,Who should attend Nexus Sprint Planning?,I started to learn the Nexus framework and found one interesting sentence:     All members of the Scrum Teams should participate to minimize communication issues.   Does this mean that someone should conduct a Planning meeting for 81 people? Or maybe I got it wrong and only Team representatives should be involved?  
2247,Does Microsoft TFS have all I need for Agile Project Management?,"If I want to use Agile, and use a Scrum implementation, will TFS do all I need?  Or do I need something else?  I have MS Project 2016 (not using Project Server), and it has an Agile template, but most people frown on MS Project for anything Agile or Scrum.  On the other hand, most of the answers I saw concerning Project and Scrum were years old.  I don't know if any of that changed in 2016-2018.  I have read these (and others),   How to use Scrum with TFS and also MIcrosoft Project  What tools do I need to manage an agile project?  Using Microsoft Project for managing a Scrum project  Are Gantt diagrams compatible with Agile methods?  I am not sure these answer my question.  Can I use both?  No need?  TFS only? "
2248,Is it necessary to address all three questions every day in the Scrum?,"Sometimes people don't make that much of a progress and even if they do, saying each day I will do something and the next day that I did...then you lose more time than it is worth it to mention it. In terms of speeding up the daily Scrum I would recommend to concentrate on one question ""What did I accomplish yesterday?"". Did you have the same experience, second that, disagree? "
2249,Imposed deadlines in tandem with Agile transformation,"A bank decided that it wants to implement agile, so it hired a few agile coaches to help throughout the journey.   However the bank has fixed deadlines (in the next 6-12 months) that aren't going anywhere, because if they do, they could jeopardize the bank's position, and it would cost a lot of money from failing to meet contracts all over the place.  When managers were highlighted of this risk, their reply was that they want both: agile transformation and achieved deadlines, slowly but surely, and that they don't want to do either full agile in one go or drop the transformation and just meet the deadlines.  What would you consult the management team of this bank to do? And what would you consult the coaches to do when facing such a situation? "
2250,Cost management without time tracking in Scrum,"In my company I'm responsible for several software development teams. Lately our managers asked me to establish a time tracking system for our developers to have better overview over the actual costs of specific projects.  I get the intention and of course I see that there not only needs to be a mechanism to calculate prices for our customers, but also to understand and interpret the performance of our company and its optimization potentials.  Since there a lots of companies out there selling tools for time tracking and pretty much everybody is used to do time tracking, I only find information on how to do time tracking, but nearly nothing about how to handle the situation based on other metrics than time.  The reason I'm searching for this alternative is, that I feel our recently pretty successful Scrum process is in danger. In contrast to other teams in my company, we deliver on time, have less software defects and significantly increased our velocity multiple times.  We did not need time tracking to achieve this and to me it seems that things, which would be judged as ""waste of time"", were not possible anymore. Just to mention some examples, for me it is ok to have the developers to take breaks whenever they feel it is a good idea. Sometimes my impression is, that some types of breaks are even increasing productivity. If this means somebody is working less hours than paid by contract, I'm ok with this as long as the total team results are over average. The current environment encourages team mates to help each others or even other developers which are not part of the team, making the team and the whole organization generally better (= higher return of investment).  Time tracking would reduce this kind of time and IMHO it could kill an environment that is actually based on motivation, trust and the developers inherent will to succeed. I think, a lot of creativity and the strive for innovation could be inhibited. The need to increase not only the own velocity but also the need to increase others productivity could get lost. Not to mention the unnecessary overhead of time tracking.  You will agree that developers are not able to think 8 hours a day without burning out at a certain point. Especially if there is a constant pressure of deadlines or exhausting pair programming sessions, to me it would be a bad long term decision to ""make sure"", that developers ""worked"" all their hours.  I even think, that time tracking is misleading. It will not provide actual costs, but estimates or approximations. There are lots of reasons for me to find an alternative. Since the time tracking approach is mostly driven by our ""non-technical"" management, to a certain degree, it seems to be a request to have at least something™ which enables them to handle the situation, because they simply do not know about software development processes and the impact of command and control structures on Scrum. They would be happy if I could simply provide a mechanism which fits their needs and provides all the necessary information.  My intuitive idea was to ask the developers to check and possibly correct their story point estimates when closing an issue. Then I could use the teams sprint velocity, the teams total amount of costs per sprint and calculate project costs proportionally. (I know, this does not provide the actual cost but neither is time tracking.)  And that is my question. Is this the common way to calculate costs? Do you have better ideas? How do you do it? "
2251,Tracking Time Remaining with GitHub (ZenHub),"We are using ZenHub for Scrum and doing point-based estimations.  When there is a issue to estimate can't we do hour based estimations with GitHub? As I can see, only point-based estimation is available.  Also, is there a way to specify the completed hours/remaining hours there? Because any progress on the burn down chart is not indicated until we close the issue. "
2252,"Why does management have to ""buy into"" Scrum?","I have read over and over that in order for Scrum to work, ""Management has to buy into Scrum.""  Can you tell me why that is?  What management are they talking about, the company stakeholders that have paid you to build it, but are not on the development team?  What happens when Scrum is used, but Management hasn’t bought into it? Why does it matter?  What is it that Management doesn't see that they don't like not seeing?  You don't have deadlines and budgets using Scrum?  It seems to me the bottom line is trust the dev team and give them what they need and they'll do you right. "
2253,Project costing & preparation,"I have a client who has an ""idea"" of his project ""that is in his mind"". He said he is not going to share any details, knowledge, and ideas until we have a contract because as he's saying ""he's worried about someone stealing his ideas"". However, in our first meeting on the client side, I think I got a global overview what he wants to have (generally). Now he's awaiting my offer and that's where I stack on to prepare it to him including price.  Should I just prepare an offer on the knowledge I have? For instance I know he wants an application to create an article/edit it, associate with some elements blabla... However, we haven't talked about details, how this information should be inserted by users etc.  Should I propose just my view generally and prepare an offer with price how I see this and how this could be done giving general information on an offer and final price? However what about details, should them be on this offer or just general list and later on we should talk about this? I am bit confused. Please of your advice.  P.S If that's wrong place to ask please advice where shall it be opened. "
2254,Automatically synchronize between Flowcharts (form of PERT charts) and Gantt charts?,"Summary  I'm seeking project-management software tools (be they online/cloud or installed software) that support automatic synchronizing between Flowcharts (a form of PERT charts) and Gantt charts.  Which solutions provide this?  Details  The Gantt support needs to support auto-dependency ""links"" between tasks. (There are tools that support a Gantt layout but with no auto-task-dependency management--eg: monday.com--but that's insufficient for my requirements.)  My initial research has not yet found anything. I've looked at several tools, but I'm far from completing a comprehensive search. Microsoft Project appears to support PERT charts, but to what extent it can do the above is currently unclear.  At this point, I'm not optimistic I'll find anything, but I'm early in my search.  EDIT: WBS Schedule Pro shows some initial promise. "
2255,Cone of uncertainty - how could we delay commitment to estimates in real life?,"I am reading a book from Steve McConnell dealing with software project estimations and I do not understand the following statement (my translation, I got the book in German):     An effective organization postpones its commitments until the work to   narrow the cone has been done. .. Reasonable commitments can be given   in the initial part of the middle phase (approx. in 30% of project   progress).   How this can be ever achieved in reality? I mean, in the company, we cannot start working on the project until the contract is in place. The contact is signed with an effort estimated and price, therefore we are already committed to it.  How is this applicable in practice then? "
2256,How to record client requirements?,"How a typical Software development company keep records of client requirements? For example:  A) One day client asked us to add a tracking code to his website.  B) Another day same client asked us to add a different code but same vendor code in a separate page. This code will not work without above tracking code A).  After few months same client asked us to update the tracking code of point A). In this situation if developers take action to update point A) then point B) will cause the issue and nobody aware about it, until it causes some issue.  Given this example, can you tell me how a large organization handling this kind of situations? Are they waiting for errors to show-up in the page? "
