0,Should my dog be able to clean out an appropriately sized Kong?,"We have a Kong classic for our 1 year-old dog. She loves the Kong and spends plenty of time with it, but there always ends up being about half of an inch of peanut butter stuck at the very bottom of the interior.  Does this mean that the Kong is too small for her tongue? Should she be able to clean out thoroughly an appropriately sized Kong, given enough time? "
1,House gecko for sustainable basement insect control?,"I'm playing with the idea of getting a house gecko and letting it live in my basement to feed on any insects it may come across.  I'd like to keep a small controlled habitat for it but leave it open so it can come and go as it needs.  In the winter however, the basement isn't fully heated. Some but not all and not to as high temperatures as the gecko would prefer.  Would the gecko know to seek out the warm habitat or might it just wander off, get lost &amp; potentially die?  Same question applies for food &amp; water. If I keep a small supply of water &amp; mealworms (or other non-traveling bugs), will the gecko know to rely on that area for sustenance?  It would have access to miscellaneous spiders, beetles and other random household insects (some flying - moths, etc) - Nothing all that large gets in unless let in.  It would have sunlight through windows as well as many dark hiding places. The basement also gets regular visitation.  Came across this as well: [website]"
2,"Inactive and scared inside, rambunctious playful outside", We just got a new puppy 2 days ago. Since we got her she has barely moved. Inside she lays around scared but outside she is a completely different dog. She plays she runs but she is still very shy. She was outside in a pen since she was born so I know this is a new experience for her. She won’t walk around the house I have to carry her everywhere and even carry her outside. We have an older dog that she loves but won’t follow her around like I was hoping she would. Is there anything that I could possibly do to help the transition from dirty pen to loving home???  
3,Dog continually licking thighs,"My oldest pet dog (male, 2.5y/o, shih tzu/bichon mix) has had a little bit of a problem lately, he will not stop licking his thighs.  We've done this:   given him small doses of dog benadryl (we thought it might be allergies) given him pain medication (we were told from an emergency clinic that his knees might be graded, but the chiropractor and his vet seem to think he's healthy) tried to rub his thighs for him and stretch out his leg a bit   Here is a video of how ""extreme"" it is (he will do this for upwards of 5 minutes at a time), and here's a picture of the aftermath:    Things we think that it may be:   this summer was his first time getting a summer cut that trimmed off almost all of his fur (normally we leave him a little bit, but this summer was warm). Maybe it's itchy? We have a second dog, one year younger, exhibiting no such issues though. he's bored (he used to lick his paws, so we started letting him take a bone to bed, etc), but this seems to be going on a bit long for boredom he's allergic to something he's actually in pain (he does not express pain with yelping like our other dog does) or, the worst case, his knee is actually in a bad situation and needs to get surgery or some such.   At this point, we're genuinely at a loss of what could be wrong with him, since we're getting conflicting information from the professionals that take care of him. Is there anything I'm overlooking that could be wrong? "
4,When can I remove my dog's bandage?,"My dog recently had surgery to correct his luxating patella. Poor boy's only a year old...  The surgery was only 3 days ago and his bandage has already started to slide down his leg, exposing part of the incision and two staples.  The top edge of the tape now appears to be putting a lot of pressure right in the center of his incision and he's begun to avoid moving more than usual; I am assuming it is pretty painful. :(  Is it too soon to cut off the bandage for him? Should I wait until Monday to bring him to our vet and have them examine him then? I don't like thinking he could be in such pain for 2 days...  I do not see any oozing from the wound yet, but he has started licking at it on rare occasions (we have a Cone of Shame, but have not yet used it). "
5,GSD Female cancer when not mated?,"Well I have 3 year GSD female. She's very healthy. She's not spayed.  I want to know that is it true that if my dog doesn't get mated/reproduce a baby she will have cancers. Is it true?  I just don't want puppies, well the fact is I can't take care anymore. I don't want to be inhuman and sell the puppies to someone. She haven't mated never yet. Please tell me will she have cancer? "
6,Is this kind of puppy's stool normal?,Is it normal that 13 days old puppy's stool is liquid and with foam (little bubbles) ?   Today I notice that one of the 4 puppies made that kind of stool and at the same time the puppy screamed loudly  like if someone were hurting the puppy. So the puppy felt pain while doing it.  Why?  Should I take the puppy to the vet? Or is something passenger?        
7,Green water after refilling dry tank with no fish,"Several months ago, I moved to new city and had to drain my 20-gallon tank and give away my fish. The tank sat empty (aside from the gravel) for several months. Last week, I decided to fill it back up, add some bacteria (Tetra brand, I think), and let it run for a couple days before adding fish. The day after I filled it, everything looked fine when I went to work. But when I got back, the water was like pea soup. I changed about 50% of the water and waited a few more days...it's still green, though not as much. Today, I changed about 25% of the water.   What I can't figure out is, why did this happen and what do I do about it? From what I've read, free floating algae is caused by a) too much light, and b) too many nutrients. But, the tank is in a dark room and the light wasn't even on that day. I've also kept the light off since this happened. I don't know where any nutrients could be coming from since there are no fish in there. My only guess is that maybe algae that had dried on the gravel is decomposing. Could that be it? And if so, do I just need to keep changing the water until it goes away? Also, is it safe to add fish, or should I wait until this is resolved? "
8,Aquarium Salt and Pink Salt,Is Himalayan pink salt okay to use in fish tanks? I have read that aquarium salt is good for conditioning water but I was curious if pink salt would do the trick as well? 
9,Keep Gerbils Quiet,What is an appropriate way to keeping gerbils quiet?  They make to much noise and I live in a small space I am not sure what to do.  It keeps me from sleeping.  Are there soundproof cages maybe? 
10,"Maltese gasps after eating fastly, is that something to worry ?","After my dog eats , a thing that it does very fast, he almost all start to loose breath and do something like gasping. When it calms down , this stops , but i find myself very worried about it.   Is this really a thing to worry ? I heard that this can be a issue with small dogs, but is there a way to deal with that ? "
11,Cat pees outside of litter box while being treated for urinary tract infection,Our cat box sits on top of a big shallow tray. We out that there to catch loose litter.   Our 12 year old cat now pees outside of the box (on the tray) 95% of the time. The other times she’ll pee in the box. I would have to clean up the tray with paper towels which is pretty annoying  She’s taking antibiotics to treat a UTI.   Is there anything we can do to encourage peeing in the box?   Should I get a shallower box so that she can easily go in it to pee? The current tray that the box sits on is too shallow to hold litter. Otherwise I would just put litter in the shallow tray bc she pees in the tray anyway.   I’m basically trying to change her behavior...and if I can’t I’m tryout Ng to find a way to make it easier to clean up.  
12,Fleas in washing machine water exhaust hose and fleas in pipes,"[Edit with what actually worked] I found out that the fleas were in the slop sink. Once I scrubbed that daily, my issue was soon a thing of the past. The key for me was to scrub all areas thoroughly where they may be. I used a rough thin green sponge and threw it away after each scrubbing. I got 5 for a buck at the dollar store and they worked great. I didn't have to deal with carpet, so I can't speak to that, except that a beater bar seems to work for others as long as you clean the canister/or throw away the bag after each vacuuming.   [Original post - Spoiler alert: It was not the accordion exhaust tube for the washing machine, it was fleas in the actual slop sink that the tube emptied into.] The water exhaust hose from my washing machine is the accordion type and is harboring fleas. (I only figured this out three days ago.)   I thought I was getting to this end of my flea ordeal, but they kept popping up. It dawned on me that the washing machine exhaust hose had a build in trap (u shaped loop) and so I put some flea killing shampoo,diatomaceous earth, and water in there and got a bunch (30 or so) when I did the next wash.   This is the last place I have them (I think), so I am looking for a way to eliminate them from this hose. For the past 3 days, I've filled it with my flea killing shampoo,diatomaceous earth, and water concoction and closed off the end of the tube with some saran wrap and a rubber band, but I still get a few when I do a wash.   Has anyone else faced this? Any ideas on how to put the final kibosh on these last few remaining fleas? I also one or two creeping up from my slop sink and they keep coming back despite my concoction and best efforts (but only in the ""slop sink"" that I use as an exhaust for my washing machine). Thanks! "
13,Does my Betta fish look Ill?,My Betta has this 20 gallon. I wanted to do a bare bottom with plants. So I added the glass jars. With the (I clean it with a vacuum) gravel and plants. I have 70 aqua clear that I baffled with a soap dish and some bigger rocks from Petco. He has an area with some sand I also clean every month. I use a net to stir it up and get some plant matter out of it. He also has some big dry leaves. I do clean the filter. I have different media I interchange when I should. I do small water changes and every so often a little less than half of a water change like 40%. I also use water conditioner. My PH is usually at a 7. Sometimes 8. I have a heater. Tank stays steady in temp 77-78. I really don't think the tank or water are the problem. He came from Petco.  So he looks better than he did when I got him. He is active and eats. I switch his food up. He has a mirror toy he uses every so often. And a clear plastic ball we put different things in. So he can poke it around. And look at what is inside. I also move the tank decor around every larger change of water. He has a leaf bed. And a log. Some floating plants. We also put pictures on the back of his tank. To give him new stuff to look at. But I'm noticing his fins don't look as great. Especially the top one. The one fin kind of curls now too. Unless he is moving. All his fins have a light white edge. No blood or black or red. Could it be fin rot? Or am I paranoid? 
14,Really large dogs in Scotland; Which breed are they?,"In Edinburgh many people seem to have these massive dogs, they look as big as a fully grown lion (at least to my 4 year old son).  This picture does not do justice to how big this dog was but it really was a large dog. There were others too which were in darker colors but equally big.  Which dog breed is this and is it local to Scotland? Would you please kindly add some links so i can study about them before trying to import one?   "
15,questions about leveling and positioning a 4 foot fish tank,"We are beginners but have ended up buying a fairly large (4 foot) fish tank and have some questions about setting it up.  we are worried about making sure it is level, as a lot of videos say this is very critical and we could get leaks if we don't get it right. the tank has built-in foam on the bottom but seems very thin, and also you can see the gaps between the foam and the cabinet.     Is this normal/will solve itself once there is water in the (200 liter) tank? Or do we need extra foam to be safe? We also noticed that the water doesn't seem completely level when we put about 2cm of water in the tank, so we used a kit from aldi underneath the cabinet that we believe makes it more level. Is doing it like shown in the photo acceptable or is there more to making sure our cabinet is stable?      The other concern is position as we've heard again and again that you don't want direct sunlight on your tank or could end up with algae problems. We're limited in where we can place this size of tank, and have a lot of windows and light in our house. We thought that in the corner although next to a window that has shutters and a glass door that has curtains would be OK, but really want to get it right before filling the tank and making it hard to move anywhere else. will this position be meeting the requirement of ""no direct sunlight"" enough, or are we likely to have problems?   thanks so much in advance for your patience and attention! "
16,Cat suddenly became paralyzed,"I brought my 18 year-old cat to the vet because she was getting a little thin.  She was otherwise just as affectionate, playful and voracious as she had always been. The vet diagnosed her with hyperthyroidism and prescribed 2.5mg of felimazole twice a day.  Approximately a month after starting this treatment, my cat's lower body suddenly became paralyzed and she now completely refuses to eat. I immediately went back to the vet. She said it had nothing to do with the treatment and recommended I euthanize or, if I refused, that I should continue the treatment supplemented with pain-killers.  The official sources I found for this treatment don't list paralysis as a side-effect although I did find pet-owners who had the same experience on related forums.  I first got my cat when I was only 10 and I care very deeply for her. I know she doesn't want to live in pain but I also know she doesn't want to die. She wants to play, chase after strings and climb on my shoulders. I want nothing more than for her to be healthy again.  Should I discontinue the treatment against the vet's recommendation? Is there any way for her to recover? "
17,"In the US what are the requirements for drug manufacturers for pets, to list side effects","A recent question Cat suddenly became paralyzed has a cat with sudden onset paralysis, after starting a new drug.  The companies drug literature does not list this as a side effect, but the OP found that several pet owners had seen paralysis after administering the drug.      although I did find pet-owners who had the same experience on related forums.   User comments suggest that as the side effect is not listed by the manufacture it could not possibly be related 1 &amp; 2      You've done the research and there really isn't any reason to think there's a link between the felimazole and your cat's new symptoms.       I'm referring to the listed side-effects from studies.   What are the actual legal requirements for pet medications?  Does the vet or the manufacture need to report this possible side effect?  "
18,"How can I improve my relationship with my Husky, and it's living situations","I just got a Husky puppy just over week ago, she is now nine weeks old (her name is Nova). She has several bad puppy habits I am attempting to train, and her living situation could be improved but I can't decide on the best plan of action.  Some Background  I have own a few dogs before, but they were all shepherds, easy to train, and easy going dogs. I knew Huskies were independent and energetic before I got one, I just had no idea how independent and energetic they were until experiencing it first hand. I live in the city, but I have an extremely large backyard (roughly .8 acre lot) for the pup, and I take her to the park almost everyday after work. I have done a lot of research on training and handling huskies, and spend 2-3 hours a day on training and playing with her. On top of that I just have her around me while I do things around the house for the remainder of my day.  Her Behavior  note: the positive negatives I chose to teach her first are ""good (girl)"" and ""no""   She is extremely energetic, despite running her at the park, walking, and playing with her she often is not ready to lie around at the house when I get home, or even go to bed. She takes a short nap and is back at it. She bites everything, I have been training her not to bite since the day I got her, but it seems to be having little affect on her. She will stop biting my shoes about 70% of the time when I say ""no"". She has several toys/bones/chewy-bone-snacks but will often only play with them for short bursts before chewing on the leg of the chair or the rug unless I give her direct play attention.  She often bites my hands (and has bitten my nose once to the point of blood) in a playful way when I go to pet her. But I know this is a bad habit, and she can't control how hard she bites when she gets to excited, so I have tried several methods to get her to stop and only lick/nuzzle. this includes:   saying ""no"" firmly and stopping play with her until she pauses to think about it, then resuming when she has quit. whimpering/yelping to make her think I'm hurt. walking away if she plays to rough.   As I expected, for a puppy, she needs pretty much 24 hour supervision accept for when she falls asleep.  Also, I have been trying to off-leash train her, I know it is extremely difficult for huskies so I'm starting early, but she only comes to me during backyard practice on command %30 of the time. She gets quite distracted, and usually won't come unless she is sure I have a treat. This is mostly to help her stay close when she is on-leash when I am walking her and teaching her how to walk next to me.  Her living quarters  Before I start, please don't hit me with negative comments about my ability to take care of this dog as far as living quarters, I'm looking for feasible solutions for a good environment. I work full time, as does my wife, so the dog is in the crate during the day and let out during lunchtime by family. I know this isn't good and contributes to her energy, but she is 9 weeks and I can't just let her roam. all my previous dogs potty trained quickly and used a doggy door, so they were autonomous until I got home to take them for a walk and play.  Like I said we have a large backyard, but each idea I have has setbacks:   Let the dog live in the backyard during the day: I would puppy-proof the yard, replace a couple broken fence pieces, and put chicken wire in the ground along the fence to prevent her from digging out. Also, buy a dog house for shelter from rain, and put a blanket in there for comfort.  negatives: she scratches at our back glass door if I just let her out without going out with her. I feel this also doesn't contribute to her learning how to behave indoor/outdoor and knowing the differences. Get the dog a play-pen indoor they have metal play pens that connect to her cage, I could make room for it on the hardwood floor.  negatives: she will probably go to the bathroom inside, she will probably whine when put in the pen, and may be able to push it around/escape. Also, does not re-enforce or teach good behavior. Build a dog run outside same idea as 1, except I build a fenced in area so she doesn't have the whole yard, and won't scratch the door. Put in a doggie door Install a doggie door through my wall and let her be independent. This is my ultimate goal, I just think it will take a really long time to get there along with training. This would allow her to get a lot of energy out during the day.  negatives: she will chew up my house because bite and chew training are  going poorly, and sometimes tracking mud into the house.   Summary  I know she is a puppy, so some of this stuff just takes time. But what could I be doing better to speed things up, or help our relationship as a whole? Based on my post:  Q: How can I improve my relationship with my puppy husky? How can I improve her reckless behavior? How can I give her a better and more sustainable living environment? "
19,Are cats aware that lilies are toxic?,"I have a few outdoor cats that like to roam freely along the street sometimes. I've just learned that lilies are poisonous to cats and I don't have any in my garden, but there is a lady nearby who grows day lilies in her garden.   Now, I can't ask her to remove them (because she won't, I tried) so I was wondering if there was another way to stop them from going there? I had these cats for years and I've never had problems with lilies before so I was wondering do cats maybe know by instinct that lilies are not good for them? "
20,New puppy devours food impossibly quick,"I rescued a puppy from a local rescue organization recently. The puppy is about 5-8 months old and is a German sheppard doberman mix. I feed him roughly 3 cups of dog food a day broken into 3 meals (breakfast, lunch, and dinner). Breakfast and lunch is a rounded scoop with dinner being a level scoop.   As soon as I put the food down my puppy devours it within &lt;8 seconds. This seems absurdly fast to me but he also does not appear to get sick or have a problem holding it down. He seems to always be hungry but I'm told that is normal.   Is this normal for a puppy to eat so quickly?  Or is this a result of not being fed properly/normally until he was rescued?   "
21,Chronic low-level cyanide poisoning in dogs,"We're trying to diagnose a recurring limp in my 6mo puppy. Been to the vet a few times, x-rays, etc.  But I had a outside thought. He's been eating the apples that fall in the front yard, and I just learned that he shouldn't eat the seeds due to the cyanide. He's been doing it probably for the last 3 months.  So we've dealt with that, but I'm curious if anyone has experience with consistent low-level cyanide poisoning, in a dog or any other animal. Can you be specific about the symptoms? If motor control was effected, was it widespread or at least symmetric, or was it limited e.g. to a specific limb? Did it come and go, or was it persistent? Did the animal recover eventually after removing the cyanide exposure?  Basically, I can find general lists of symptoms, but I'm interested in how it played out in specific cases. "
22,Nitrite 5 ppm why are my fish still alive,"I have a new tank which I didn't cycle before adding fish (didn't know about it).  However since then I have read about cycling and have purchased a fresh water test kit. I tested my water and got the following:   Ammonia 0 Nitrite 5 ppm (this is the highest lvl my color chart has) Nitrate 0   Its been like that for a week despite 30% water changes every two days.  Everything I have read on internet forums say my fish should be dead. However they seem fine. They are not gasping for breath at the top of my tank like would be expected for nitrite poisoning.  I have 6 tetras and a bristlenose pleco in a 60 litre tank.  Has nitrite toxicity to fish been overstated? Why are my fish still alive?  Update Its been two weeks now, Nitrites are still at 5 ppm, I have upped the water changes to 50% every day, with no effects on the Nitrite readings. I still haven't lost any fish. My guess is that the nitrites are actually well over 5 ppm so the 50% water changes are not enough to bring it below 5 ppm. I'm starting to see Nitrates in the tank so the cycle is progressing.  Updates 2 Its been three weeks and the nitrites have now gone to zero. I havn't had lost any fish, or seen any signs of nitrite poisoning.  "
23,15 month Dashound overly demanding for walks,My Dashound 15 months will not play with her toys she just constantly watching me starring all she wants is to go for walks I walk her 3 X a day if I'm not quite ready by her evening time to work she starts tearing up her pillow cause she mad I'm not ready at her time I walk her in the evening around 7:00pm and she starts bothering me at 5:00 that's too early it's too hot what the world can I do she's also very hyper she wants all my attention allay long I don't have time to play all day I have things to do she's gotten worse !!!

24,What are reasons for the nitrit/NO2 peak during aquarium installation/start phase?,After installing an aquarium with   a new filter without bacteria in the media new/washed gravel plants which don't have sufficient roots yet (to absorb nitrate/NO3&lt;ref>citation needed for the fact that plants absorb nitrate with roots&lt;/ref>)   the nitrit peak occurs. Which one(s) of these conditions (and possible others) cause the nitrit/NO2 peak? Which one(s) have more or less influence?  I want to evaulate the possibility to install an undergravel filter in a running aqaurium where I'd have to move the gravel and replant plants step by step. I have a 60 l freshwater aquarium.

26,In what ways are dogs affected by alcohol?,"Disclaimer1: I have no intention of actually ever feeding mine or any other dog with alcohol or other harmful substances.  Everybody seems to know that alcohol is bad for pets. But just how bad?  When searching the internet the only things I can find are:   Websites that tell me alcohol is bad for dogs/cats, well thank you but it is clear that alcohol is a toxin   Websites that tell me how to diagnose alcohol poisoning in dogs, very useful but not quite what I am looking to find   A yahoo answers question dating back to 2009 giving some figures and pseudonumbers but nothing to back these things up   All of the things mentioned above do have the same problem: They give great advice, etc. But all the amounts, numbers and mentions of alcohol are in relative sizes (e.g. much, little, high, low). The problem of these relative sizes is that they are not of any use without any contextual information they relate to.  Q: Is there any hard-data on how much alcohol affects a dog in what way?  Googling for most common dog results in the Labrador Retriever, thus we will assume this specific breed for this question2.  1Because I feel it necessary to make this fact clear 2It makes sense that these numbers will be subsequently different for a Chihuahua or a Bernese Mountain Dog "
27,How do I encourage my cat to jump over a baby fence,"You'd think it would be simple but my Norwegian Forest Cat is loothe to jump over the 60 cm high fence from carpet to carpet.   Currently he will jump out from a covered cat toilet but I think he still reticent about the other way.   How do I encourage his jumping? We just put it up. It surrounds his food area, toilet and favourite window. We don't want him to use an alternate route through the baby bed which  has a rail to jump over- he has jumped in there at least once. Now he will have an extra area of his own use that is not disturbed by my one year old. How do they encourage movie cats?   "
28,General Care of a Dog's Pads?,"Peanut and I returned from our afternoon long walk, and she's passed out on my lap. She is a 2 and a half year old medium standard female Dachshund. As she was sleeping, I checked her paws, nails, pads, etc. to see if she needed any nail trimming (she didn't.)  As I was doing this, I noticed her pads have a few, well, rough patches. Now normally her pads are smooth in one direction (back to front) and slightly rough, or grippy in the other (front to back) and I'm not really sure why that is, but that's normal.  Today, however, one of her pads, left front main (or center) pad, has a patch of roughness, that I can feel in any direction. Need I be concerned? If so, what would I do (other than a vet trip, which I will if needed, but would rather home remedy it)?  How should a dog's pads be cared for, generally speaking, or do we simply leave them alone? "
29,Assimilating new puppy to cats,"My husband and I adopted a 4 month old puppy into our home with two 4 yr old cats 4 days ago. She's very mellow for a puppy and not very vocal, generally. At this point our puppy, Maya, and our cats occasionally get within 5-6 feet from each other but everyone is still on edge and only out of necessity. Maya is curious but we don't want to push our cats past their comfort zones. I understand time is the biggest factor here but I want to be sure we're instilling Maya with the right impression of the cats.   We're encouraging Maya to leave them alone by calling her away from the cats when she starts wondering toward them and using ""no"" on the occasion that she does bark at or chase them. I want to give our cats the time they each need to feel safe with her but am worried this will teach Maya she's not supposed to be near them. Is this the best approach? Any other ideas? This is my first experience introducing a puppy to cats and would love some advice.  "
30,Space between bars of bird cage guidelines,"For either making or buying a bird cage, are there any standards or conventions specifying the space between bars appropriate to each species ( cockatoo, cockatiel, parakeet, finch, etc.)?  In a couple cages I measured the space between bars was exactly one centimeter. Is that common across most cages, or does it vary by bird species? "
31,4 month old puppy RAN from crate to her bed in the living to pee on it after peeing outside just an hour ago. Always likes to pee on her bed. Why?,"I have a 4 month old puppy mongrel who is well train, very, VERY well exercised (but not over the top), command trained, space confinement / crate trained, taken out about 4 or 5 times a day to pee / poo.  She has a crate and 2 very comfy beds (exact same model) which I bought for her.  She LOVES to pee on her bed (and she really loves her bed as well it's super comfy), has happened many times before. I can't understand why and I'm thinking maybe she wants to ""claim"" the bed as hers but in that case shouldn't she just mark it with a little pee not the whole flow? And this also goes against the principle that dogs like to keep their sleeping area clean.  As such I have taken away the beds and only put it out beside me (so that I can supervise) for her to lie on it only after she has peed outside.  However just 15min ago she RAN from crate to her bed just outside the crate to pee on it after peeing outside just an hour ago. Always likes to pee on her bed. Why?  Can someone help me understand her psychology / what's going on in her mind? thanks so Much! I love my Puppy!  P.S. when she sleeps for the night in her crate and needs to pee, she diligently goes to the pee tray in her cage to pee in it which is great, I just don't understand why she wants to pee on her comfy bed "
32,Dog destroys everything I plant in flower pots,"My 2 year old dog, whenever I plant anything in some flower pots that I have in the garden, likes to dig and get it out of the flower pot. He only does it when I have something planted (so it's not because he just likes to dig) and he only stops when every plant is out of their flower pot.   I have punished him several times for that and now he seems to know that he is doing something wrong (judging by the look on his face and by the distance he keeps from me everytime he has done it) but he still can't stop doing it.  How can I stop him from de-planting all my plants out of their flower pots? Any ideas? "
33,What treats are safe for horses?,The care of horses can be opinionated and there is a lot of varying ideas about what is safe for horses to have as treats and the quantities.   So the question is:  What treats are safe for horses and in what amounts? Are there any considerations that we need to be aware of when feeding horses treats? 
34,Any research on whether we should adopt a companion for the cat?,"I have a four-year-old female cat. She had a male companion until she was 6 months old, when she lost him to an accident. Ever since, she has been alone. My fiancée and myself have a very busy life. I only spend 2-3 hours a day at home in the weekdays. My fiancée, although she works from home, she travels quite often. The cat ends up spending the whole day on her own.   My only concern is my cat's well being. I wonder, if there is any scientifically-backed reasons to adopt another kitten, to be a companion for my cat. Does my cat feel lonely, sad, or depressed because she does not have anyone to play or fight with? Will another cat contribute positively to her well being. Is there any research on the topic? "
35,My cat won't stop licking himself?,"My cat recently got neutered and must wear the e-collar as he's already ripped open the incision once. Most of the time he's licking the collar trying to get at his wound.   That's not the problem. I remove the collar every once in a while (closely supervised) so he can have some time to relax. When I take off the collar he won't stop licking and gnawing at his upper chest, upper front arms, and scratching the back of his head. He's not even going for the incision.   This wasn't an issue before he got the e-collar (except for the occasional scratching). He's already gotten flea medicine when we got him about a month ago.   Is there something wrong? Should I see a vet? (We have an appointment next week as a follow-up) "
36,"Medically, what does it mean when a dog smacks her lips repeatedly?","My Dachshund, a spayed female, 16 months old, is exhibiting a behavior that I wonder at. Our previous dog, a Labrador/Doberman mix, never did it, as far as we can recall (we had him his whole life, 17years.)  Most of the time, she keeps her mouth shut (barring tasting, biting, eating, etc.) But every once and a while, it's like she gets a dry mouth. She'll start smacking her lips, and licking them. It's not too much saliva, as she doesn't drool at all. We try to put her next to her water dishes, but most of the time she doesn't drink. She did this behavior again last night, and promptly up-chucked a nice pile.  We just had her at the vet, for an all day comprehensive check up and vaccination update. They didn't notice anything, so she either didn't do it, or they didn't think it was worth mentioning. (My wife dropped her off and picked her up, and I forgot to ask her to ask them.)  Does anyone know why she might be doing this? Or know if it is ""normal"" behavior in a very vertically-challenged dog? "
37,"I'd like to adopt a cat, but I have allergies","Me and my SO would like to adopt a cat, however we have some concerns:   Her parents have a cat (russian blue) and I'm quite allergic to it My nose starts running My eyes turn red and become itchy   I used to own a cat years ago when I lived with my parents, however it was a countryside and cat most of the time, obiviously, was living outdoors. There were no issues back then.  Only thing I can think of after doodling and googling around would be allergy to their dandruff (apologies if it's not right word).  Are there any species (I was adviced to adopt siberian cat) that I could live with?  Other things worth mentioning:   We live in a 35m2 flat I've head breathing issues since 7 y/o I'm using Salbutamol on daily basis. Mostly once a day   Is there anything else I should consider before adopting? "
38,Is okay for my dog to not eat or excrete waste while receiving Buprenex for pain relief?,"My dog has an inflamed knee and her veterinarian recommended she undergo surgery to fix the cause of the inflammation. For now the doctor gave me a supply of Buprenex for pain management.  While she's on the drug she doesn't eat or do her business. I can't tell if she's drinking either. She is almost always sleeping or half-asleep, with a very stoned look, having sluggish movements and even aborted maneuvers.  When I ask for her attention she peps up and is her attentive self again, but only for a moment. She is quickly subdued back into her medicated state.  She is a 5 lb chihuahua, orally receiving 0.1 ml of Buprenex every 8-12 hours, with the goal of managing pain during healing or until having surgery.  I've decided to do the surgery after understanding what this treatment option is like.  But I won't be able to get advice or schedule the surgery until the animal hospital opens again tomorrow.  So, I'm asking about Buprenex here because it is now day two where she hasn't taken in or expelled anything, and I'm not sure if this is normal or enough of a concern to stop treating her pain. I have worries such as:   Is this normal, considering she is so inactive? How long can she go without eating or using the bathroom? I haven't seen her drink, what should I be thinking in regards to that? If she moves as if in pain (limping or hopping gingerly, walking awkwardly, bottoming out instead of supporting her weight on the bad knee) but has a normal appetite and digestive cycle, is that better than how she is now?  "
39,How is owning a deaf cat different from a cat who can hear?,"Anyone own or used to own deaf cat?  If so, what was it like?  Was it lot of works compared to hearing cat? What kind of signs/signals you use to communicate deaf cat?   Thank you for answering! "
40,"Mouse is acting strangely, what should I do?","I was coming home last night and the street light in front of my house was out again so I was driving slowly down the hill. I see this mouse in the middle of the road going around in a counterclockwise circle following it's tail.  I stopped otherwise I would have ran it over.  Then I park the car and get out and try and shoe the mice away into some bushes but it won't leave so I go around and park my car at the house.  If it stayed there it would get run over for sure. When I looked at this mouse's face it looked really sad. I come back with a foam tray to push it a bit because I don't want to touch it, but it isn't budging.  Then I go get a broom to try and sweep it a bit but it runs around in a much bigger counterclockwise circle with small circles and then goes and sits in the middle of the road again. Then I'm trying to get it to move with the broom and it just sits there without minding being poked by the broom and it makes some sad squeaks and a sad face.  It was really late almost 1 a.m. but eventually I get it into a box and keep it in my back yard.  I put in a bowl of water, a banana and some walnuts in the box and another box with holes on top so the birds don't get at the mouse.  Today I went to look and it had escaped the box somehow, eaten a bit of banana and left a few strands of hair in the water bowl so I thought the problem solved itself and the mouse went away.  But then I saw the mouse 5 feet away half under a hedge in the yard and ants were crawling on the poor thing :(  I got a better box and then I got a kitchen mitten and wrapped it in plastic wrap so I could pick up the mouse and put it in the box.  The mouse was really docile and it made these really sad squeaks. I think it started to play dead a little bit when I put it in the box.  How do I fix this mouse so it can go back into the wild and do mouse things?  tl;dr : I found a mouse that I think is either depressed, hurt it's foot, or is pregnant. I don't know if the mouse is exhibiting regular mouse behavior or if something is wrong with it. Also I don't know how to tell mouse gender so I can't rule out pregnant. But this mouse seems really unlucky or prone to dying, what should I do?  p.s. also I did my best to be descriptive but I most likely missed things so please feel free to ask me questions and I will do my best to answer them.

41,Should I get a bigger cage for my Lovebird?,"so my family has had a single Lovebird for plenty of years now, but its cage is about 15"" W x 15"" L x 18"" H. It wasn't until recently that I learned that the cage I bought might be bad for them, so I wanted to ask, should I get a bigger one? If so, what size would be recommended? "
42,Why does my cat's meow have no sound?,"I've looked all over for an explanation. Surprisingly, there's not much information about this (most being theories).  Are there any cat experts that can explain this? I've heard ""the sound is too high pitched for humans to hear"", which would be neat, but seems as if it would be testable and confirmed by now.  My Question  Only one of my cats silently meow, most of the time giving no sound at all. Why does her meows give no sound?  Extra Details  She is around (estimated) 10 years old. In her early years, she wasn't very talkative. She was an outside cat until she got injured, which we had to amputate her tail. She has been an inside cat ever since. She has become very affectionate since then, which has brought on the meowing, which most of the time give no sound. "
43,Why are dog belly buttons so different from our own?,"I'm going to assume that no one needs to be told what human belly buttons look like.  But most people probably don't know what dog belly buttons look like.  Here's a photo of one, which should make it easier to understand why we usually don't notice them:    I'm guessing that the difference between the two has something to do with the way the knot is tied, but is there a more thorough explanation?  Why are dog belly buttons so different from our own? "
44,Are the cats' tail movements voluntary or not?,"I have asked another question, concerning the cats' tails, where people answered me that cats show their emotions through their tails.  Generally, I have seen the cats move their tails a lot. Are these movements (not only limited to the expression movements) voluntary or not?  For instance, a friend of mine has a cat, and when she calls her name, she wiggles her tail. Is that voluntary? "
45,How can I decipher how aggressive my Betta is?,"I am thinking of adding tank mates to my tank environment. I already have a Betta fish, and am thinking of adding a few more different types of fish like Neon Tetras. However, after reading the previously linked article I starting thinking (A rather dangerous pastime). The article states:     it’s best to avoid adding neons to a tank with a betta who is known to be overly aggressive. As you probably know, individual male and female betta personalities can range from the timid to the outright belligerent. If your betta has a bad reputation you may want to concede to his desire to go solo.    But how do you know if your betta is overly aggressive? Is it just a trial and error thing, like ""Lets put an apple snail in my tank and see what happens!"" And then you come home and the snail is toast. So you say ""Oh, I guess my betta is aggressive! better not put any more fish in there!""  Something about that doesn't seem right. Is there some way to test of your betta fish is overly aggressive? (Without killing anything) "
46,Bunny-sitting at home exclusively or not?,"When going in vacation for an extended period of time, meaning 1 or 2 weeks, would you consider leaving your bunny to a pet-boarding place? Knowing that rabbits are vulnerable to stress, would it be safe for them?  "
47,How can I reduce and control bird dander?,"My wife just found out she has a condition which is worsened by many types of allergens, like bird dander.  We have 5 parakeets, 1 pineapple green cheek conure, and a cockatiel.    The cockatiel produces the greatest amount of dander when he shakes out, but we've had him for 10 years and he's around 15 years and thus my wife doesn't want to re-home him.    What can I do to reduce the amount of bird dander?   I'm considering an air purification unit, but I've heard from a news report that many are not as effective as they say they are. I'm interested in knowing what people's experience is with air purification units used around birds.  Is there anything else I can do to control the amount of bird dander? "
48,Alligator as a pet,"I don't have any experience taking care of reptiles so obviously I wouldn't want a gator as a pet. But I might have children in the future and what if they find alligators so fascinating and even see baby alligators that are being sold? (I am using an example of 2 children)  There are 2 main questions that I would need to ask them. One of them is the obvious ""Do you really want an alligator as a pet?"" The other is the not so obvious ""Do you have any experience with reptiles?""  There are so many possibilities here. The children could say ""No we don't want a gator as a pet but we have handled gators at the zoo after school."" or ""Yes we want a gator and we have had experience with gators."" or ""No we don't want a gator and we haven't had any experience with reptiles."" or ""Yes we want a gator but we haven't had any experience with reptiles."" It gets even more complicated if the children are of different ages and thus 1 has handled reptiles and the other hasn't and/or if 1 wants a gator and the other doesn't. This leads to at least 16 possibilities.   The other bad thing is that I haven't found anything really comprehensive about raising alligators. I search on google for ""How to raise an alligator"" and what do I get? I get very few that actually go into how to raise gators. Most talk about raising caimans or reptiles in general(and only go into minor detail about the alligator) and of the ones that do talk about raising gators, most are not comprehensive enough for someone who really wants to raise gators.  A third bad thing is that I am in Ohio. I don't know of anybody who raises gators in this cold state.  So what should I tell my children if they really do want an alligator and have had experience with reptiles? Should I tell them that I can't get a gator for them since there isn't much I can find about raising gators? Or should I tell them that they can have a gator but they have to be very careful since even young gators can give someone a deadly bite? "
49,Why is my dog's fur growing back so unevenly after shaving?,I have a pharaoh hound. I have had her for about a year now. During spring this year(I think it was in May or maybe early June) she was shaved. My dad shaved her in such a way that it looked like cubism(which is a style of art that is all about squares and cubes).  At first it was growing back normally. But at some point some of the hair on her back dramatically slowed down in growth. To compensate for it there was a dramatic increase in the amount of hair on her back legs.  Why would hair grow normally and then all of a sudden abnormally? Does she have cancer in her hair follicles of her legs and an early telogen phase on a part of her back or something? 
50,Can WiFi be harmful for my budgerigar family?,"My budgie pair is all ready for breeding. But for the last 2 months I've been using WiFi throughout my home. Now I'm worried if WiFi radiation will lead newly hatched babies to death, or if there will be some other troubles.   Has anybody ever faced such a situation? Is it risky? "
51,ASF = Multimammate?,"I bought a small multi for my royal python, as part of a bundle of ""let's try her on various things to see which ones she prefers"". So far so good, the small mice and rat pups have all gone down a treat over the past few weeks, and she's just eaten the multi nicely.  I went over to my iHerp profile to log it, and the options available included   ASF - Adult ASF - Fuzzie ASF - Hopper ASF - Jumbo ASF - Pinks   Google tells me that ASF is an abbreviation for African Soft Furred rodent, which describes what a multimammate is, but are they the same thing?  And if so, then which size on iHerp will correspond to what I bought as a ""small"" one? "
52,"Yorkshire Terrier, Long snout versus short snout?","My question is pertaining to the Yorkshire Terrier (Yorkie). I am specifically referring to Champion line show breed. Apparently, Yorkies have two different types of snout. Some of them have Short Snout (which is Babyface), while others have Long Snout.  Via phone I have spoken with a breeder, who said that some breeders say the ""Short Snout"" has health problems. She also said that other breeders argue this point, and say they do not. Specifically that the ones with the smaller snouts have bite issues, and chewing, and so forth.  A good reference to a similar debate can be found here: [website]Besides conversations like this, actually resource material is hard to find. There is very little information about this online.  Hence my question, are there any health (or bite) issues related to a Short Snout, as opposed to a Long Snout?  Are there any other Pro's/Con's to one, as opposed to the other? "

54,Why do some dogs turn their heads to look up at their owner?,"I've noticed that some dogs have a tendency to always turn their heads to look up at their owners, i.e. even when walking. I assume this is instinctive behavior, looking to the alpha of the pack for instructions/approval.    Is this genetic or trained, and if genetic, what breeds tend to do this?  What is this behavior, and what does it mean about the dog? Are such breeds particularly friendly, eager to please, and trainable?   "
55,How do you clean poop out of a long hair cat's fur?,"I have never had a long-hair cat before.  We just picked up two that we rescued, and brought them home.  One of them pooped in the carrier during the drive home.  There is now poop in her fur.   I tried to get as much of it out with toilet paper, then a wet rag, but I couldn't get it all, and she was getting pretty upset.  What is the best way to clean up this mess?  Do I need to give her a full bath?  She doesn't know us, and she's in a new environment, so the transition has been traumatizing enough; I'd rather avoid a full bath if at all possible, at least for the time being. "
56,Recommendations for introducing adult cats to newly adopted adult cats,"Recommendations for introducing kittens to adult cats covers a lot of good information about introducing new kittens to a cat household.  However, we've just adopted 2 older cats (11 and 13) into our household of cats ranging from 2 to 8 years of age.  Is there anything different that should be done for new adult cats?  This answer on a different question mentions:     It's usually recommended to confine new cats to a small room (like a bathroom) for the first couple of days anyway   I have to admit I'd never heard that before; we'd done it in the past when introducing kittens, but that was almost incidental, since the small rooms were the most convenient (and a single kitten fit fairly well in there).  We've given the new cats free access to the whole basement (the bathroom seemed too small, particularly if we were going to put in two sets of bedding, food, water, and a litter pan).  Was this a mistake?  They seem to be adjusting very well so far, and have explored the basement thoroughly, as well as the door at the top of the stairs (sniffing at our other cats through the crack).  Both of the new cats seem comfortable in the new environment, with one of them seeming 100% at home, and the other showing some minor skittishness (but he still can easily be coaxed into a lap for some petting and purring).  Does their age allow us to do the transition more quickly?  Or is it more likely to cause territoriality/dominance issues with the other cats? "
57,Why is my turtle refusing to eat anything but dried prawns?,"I've been feeding my turtle some dried prawns, corn, carrots, peas, as well as other vegetables and some fruits.  Recently the turtle had developed an inclination towards prawns, it would not eat the vegetables. I tried mixing the food, but it would just smell the vegetables and go by seeking prawns. I also tried not putting prawns it ended up not eating. I also occasionally feed it boiled chicken and it would eat them.    As a side note: can cooked chicken like escalope or just the normal chicken served with rice be fed to the turtle?   What do you recommend I do? "
58,How do you make sure a guard Llama stays protective but is also used to your own dogs?,"I have a small hobby flock of sheep that I use for training my herding dogs. These sheep are pets and are pretty used to dogs. I recently added a guard Llama because the lambs were being prayed on by Coyotes and the occasional loose/stray dog was harassing them.  My Llama is a male who is very friendly and is great with the lambs and Ewes. He's calm and comfortable with people and in general has been a joy to be around. So far when he is on the big open field with lots of lush food he isn't interested enough in the grain bucket to come over when I'm trying to collect him and keep him separate while I can work the sheep. So I've been using an experienced dog to bring him in with the whole flock then separate him while I work the flock. He seems to have figured out that this dog doesn't mean harm and he isn't acting stressed or trying to protect the flock from the dog.  If I keep doing this will he get to used to dogs and not be as protective of the sheep? Will he know the difference between my dog and a dog that means harm? I'm assuming he'll know the difference between my dog and a Coyote but I'm not sure. Since he has been on the field I have only had one Coyote incident, a bite on a sheep's neck, but normally that would have meant the loss of a sheep. So I know he's being protective and since that incident the sheep seem to make sure they stay with him whenever they are worried. How else can I get him in if I shouldn't use my dog?  "
59,What are shoal-fish and how many should be in a group?,"A recent answer suggests that some aquarium fish are 'shoal fish' and that there is a minimum number that should be included in a group when adding to your tank.  What are shoal-fish?   If I should not add just one, how many should I add? "
60,Would this setup stress the fish?,"Petco advertises on their website a 2.5 gallon aquarium with a divider that it claims can house two betta fish. However, the divider is not opaque. Would that be stressful or harmful to the fish, having a rival right there with no way to reach him?  Edit: Apparently 2.5 gallons is too small for one fish, let alone two. But what if I got a larger tank and did the same kind of divider? "
61,How long does it take for a snail to mature into an adult?,"I recently bought some turbo snails.  Shortly after, I was gifted with a ton of little snails that come out after dark.  Unfortunately, they seem to just be food for everyone else.  Maybe I should try to put them in the sump?  How fast should the snails grow / how long until they reach their full size? "
62,Should I worry about my cat jumping out the window?,"I just bought a cat and live on the 14th floor of my building, and I realized that he doesn't have any fear of heights like dogs do. I am really afraid that he might jump from a window.   I did some research, but could only find things like ""If a cat jumps from the third floor he might survive, even with some injures"" and I was like ""don't cats have any sense of height?! Why would he jump from so high?""  So, should I be worried about my cat jumping out of a window and hurting himself?  "
63,Why can't my rabbit lift it's head?,"Thursday started normally    6AM each of 5 upstairs bunnies getting personal grooming.   9AM everyone in for nap time.   10AM Lyra (3 Years) is very sick, can not lift her head, call to find which rabbit vet is available.  10:30 everyone is at a conference but one, who is out for the morning.     Video  Lyra 1, Lyra 2 Additional symptoms include head tilts to either side when she lays stretched out.  Around 10:30 I have moved her to carrier with towels supporting her.  One pupil is dilated, her anxiety is high.   10:45. Lyra passes.   2:30PM speaking to the only rabbit vet still in town.   3:30PM in his office for a postmortem Dx.  Rapid onset leaves two options, stroke or trauma, 4:00pm x-ray is clear.  combined with video I took of the symptoms Dx= stroke.  4:45pm at the crematorium, 6PM leaving the crematorium with the ashes in the urn we picked out 3 weeks ago for our geriatric bunny Baxter (11 Years) while pre-shopping.  He is still doing ok.  Harmony (7 Years) is Lyra's bond mate, a bit sad but OK. As are all the other rabbits in the house.   Friday Morning    4:00AM Ruby (3 years) is not sleeping in her normal place on the floor at the foot of my bed. I find her hiding under the bed in her 'comfort' corner. She refuses to come when called. I get her out and up on the bed. She is moving fine, but when she lays still for several minutes her head tilts to the right side.        5:30 AM Ruby is getting worse, pronounced head tilt to the right, when laying in her 'room' next to her water bowl.  She did manage to eat some pumpkin.  I put up an exercise pen to keep her from going under the bed.      6AM Ruby can not lift her head, very similar to Lyra, ""Not again, please"".  Lucille begins calling to find an available emergency rabbit vet.  I begin searching the internet.  On MediRabbit we find “Head-down syndrome” in a rabbit Nothing else similar is found. Good news "" All affected rabbit recovered within a week.""   Video Ruby 1,  Ruby 2,  Ruby 3,  Ruby tries to eat a pellet of food  *8:50AM Yesterday's rabbit vet is not available for several more hours. Found another one who is available for an emergency visit.  This vet has never seen a rabbit present with these symptoms. He searches the Exotic Veterinary forum (I can't remember the name of it).  Ruby lifts her head a couple times.  Seems like she might be getting better already, must be the head down syndrome.  Just to be proactive he gives her a shot of long acting Penicillin G one of the few types that is safe for rabbits.  We head home feeling much better.    Noon; back home. we stopped by the feed store and picked up a couple more bales of hay &amp; and some bags of wood pellet liter.  One of the three downstairs bunnies is dead.  Everything was fine this morning.  His bond mate is fine. Something significant is going on, I post the Videos online and we start calling, the primary rabbit vet in the area is contacted at the conference.  1:00 we are back at the office of the vet from Thursday, with the dead rabbit for a full autopsy, and Ruby for a second opinion, as ""Head-down syndrome - All affected rabbit recovered within a week"" seems unlikely. He also has never seen a bunny present like this. E. cuniculi (EC) and ear infections are ruled out.  Progress is too fast for either of them. He reaches out to several nationally recognized rabbit vets, but response is not immediate.  After sometime, he recalls similar symptoms in geese, does some research; We have a new probable Dx Botulism from the hay.  This is recognized issue with horses.    *3:30PM we are back home, everyone else is still ok.  We empty all the hay racks, and put that hay aside, it will be going off to be tested.   *10:00PM everything seems stable.  We are dosing everyone with Vitamin B .25ml per the vet from the conference.  Ruby will be seeing him on Monday, for a follow up.  Saturday Morning  Ruby is about the same as last night; 90% paralyzed from the middle of her back forward.  She is maintaining her good bowel and bladder habits.  I slept on the floor with her all night, she woke me up every hour or two to take to the litter box.  If someone is not laying with her she gets scared and tries to move to much and seems like she could hurt herself   Sunday Morning  Ruby was stable most of yesterday, with a veracious appetite (eating moistened critical care &amp; pellets out a bowl), with her appetite dropping off at bed time.    She woke me up just before 2AM this morning to take her to the litter box. I left her for a while so she could poop.  When I brought her back to bed her paralysis had increased significantly. Her rear legs have gone from 100% function to maybe 10-20%.  She snuggled with me throughout the night giving lots of teeth chitters (bun purs), other than her mouth she has lost most of the remaining head and upper body control.  Continuing Sub-Q fluids, She took a couple of bites of breakfast, unsure if this is lack of appetite, or if trying to eat is to much work.  Monday Morning(This should be the final update describing the symptoms, we seem to be stable and entering the recovery phase of the illness)  Stable for 24 hours now, no new deterioration last night.  Yesterday gave 1cc of Reglan (Metoclopramide) her appetite returned. She continues to enjoy snuggling, body paralysis seems be equal, with about 10% function at all limbs and head. Maintaining super litter box habits. We both slept much better last night, but up every couple of hours for potty breaks.   Her breakfast is:   1 table spoon critical care 1 table spoon Oxbow adult rabbit food (basic T) 5 Table spoons water Mix and allow to sit for a couple minutes to form a mushy paste   She eats sitting in my lap (cross legged on floor) with her head draped over my thigh. I hold the bowl so she can stretch just a bit to eat and relax to get her nose out of the food or water.  Wash her face with a damp wash cloth for clean up.  Ruby Breakfast Video  Communicable possibilities We started with 8 rabbits living inside in a two story house. 5 upstairs as three groups (2, 2, 1) with baby gates keeping them separated by several feet, from each other.

64,How can botulism occur in hay and is it hazardous to my pet?,"A recent question Why can&#39;t my rabbit lift it&#39;s head? suggested that botulism in hay could be problematic for some pets.  When I think of Botulism I think of poorly canned food, how could it occur in hay? What are the risks for my pet?  "
65,Why are my fish dying?,"Since moving house 8 weeks ago iv'e inherited a fish pond containing around 20 fish which is 270cm in length, 130cm wide, and 35cm deep in the middle. It uses a Hozelock Cyprio Ecopower Plus 5000 Filter which has a maximum flow rate of 2250 LPH.    I have never owned fish before, so reading the instructions on the back of the fish food the previous owners left behind it said to feed them 3 times a day, as much as they can eat in a few minutes.  I felt this was a lot, because they only manage one cup in a few minutes and talking to others it would seem to be.  So i have been feeding them once a day, usually around 6pm.  They have one cup full of this(the cup is in the picture)...    This morning 5 of the fish are dead and i am concerned that there is something wrong with the pond water, pond itself, or the feeding pattern.  At least one of the fish in this picture looks swollen, or is that normal?    I looked in the filter and can see lots of insects that look like black maggots inside moving around (those black things on the foam)....    Could there be a problem with the filter? should there be insects/life inside?  The fish that are alive don't appear to be interested in the food today (you can see it floating on top of the water in the first picture).  Also is the pond too busy? there are quite a lot of lilly pads, and the plant towards the bottom end on the right has grown significantly recently.  Could the fish be getting trapped or stuck in one area of the pond?  Behaviour wise, they seem to congregate by the water inlet, gulping at it.  And often come to the surface and just gulp, ignoring the food.  One of them is constantly swimming on its side in a shallow area, which is unusual.  Any advice greatly appreciated, as i am concerned that more will die if there is a problem with environment they are living in.  To summarize the key concerns...  Do one or more of the dead fish look swollen? What kind of fish are they? Should the filter have life/insects in it? and is it dirty looking? Is the pond overstocked? Should they be gulping at the surface? Is the feeding pattern ok? "
66,What is the recovery profile for botulism?,"Assuming my pet rabbit survives botulism poisoning, what should the recovery process look like?  I have researched a lot and either am not finding, or am not understanding the details.   Pet ingests the botulinum toxin In 6 - 36 hours the pet starts showing signs but can be as late as 10 - 30 days Symptoms in the pet are generally a descending paralysis, first the head or neck, then fore limbs, etc.  Nerves are damaged by the toxin. Treatment involves antitoxins (problematic) and/or palliative care, as the nerves will regenerate given time. Recovery... Weeks to months later the pet has full or nearly full recover.   I am not finding anything solid about step 5, ""Recovery...""     Is the recovery descending (head gets better first), reversed, or general?  Are there milestones in the recovery process (i.e. when 'this' happens things only get better)? What are common difficulties that must be overcome?   A peer-reviewed case study of multiple recoveries in humans and other animals would be great, but I cannot locate one and don't think one exists. The best answer will be from experience, preferable with more than one case.   "
67,Is filtered water healthy for dogs?,"Is filtered water (Brita filters, etc.) healthy for dogs? If so, what are the risks? I know that some owners give their dogs unfiltered water, e.g. from the sink. I was also going to give my dog some filtered water but wasn't sure if it was safe. "
68,How To Introduce Additional Clownfish,"I've had two clownfish for 6 - 8 months, one orange/white and one black/white.  Now I'm trying to add more, but meeting heavy resistance.  I realize that you can't mix species but I always thought mine were Ocellaris (the least aggressive).  I bought two ocellaris and put them in and the original two were super aggressive towards them.  So I thought maybe I was mistaken about what I had (Can a black/white clownfish even be a Percula?) Here are some pics if you could correct me:    Anyway, so I removed the two Ocellaris and tried a (smaller) Percula.  In both cases I added them overnight and over the past two days I've had it hang out in a breeder box right where in the spot they ""host""; trying to force them to get acquainted.  The perculas fared better but they still haven't let up.  Do I need to get a pair of smaller clowns?  A pair of larger clowns that aren't as vulnerable or even a few more clownfish all at once?  Maybe be patient for a week or two with the breeder net?  Or do I have to give up and get rid of these clowns and start over??  I'm running out of ideas. "
69,How do I make sure my fish tank is safe after my apartment has been fumigated?,"I just received notice that my apartment is getting bug-bombed this weekend. I'll have to move all my animals out of the apartment for the day while the gas dissipates, but my fish are in a 55 gallon tank that won't fit in my car, and is really just too big to move just for a day.  I'm going to move the fish into a smaller tank, hopefully they'll be fine overstocked for a day. What I don't want to happen is for me to move them back into the bigger tank, only to die from the chemicals from the bug-bombing.  How can I make sure that the tank is safe for my fish after the bug-bomb?  I plan on putting plastic over the top, that should help keep chemicals from going into the tank, and then doing a heavy water change before I put the fish back into the big tank. Is it too risky to assume that the tank is safe/should take the tank apart and thoroughly clean it? "
70,How can I make sure my Bearded Dragon's terrarium is safe after my apartment has been fumigated?,"I just received notice that my apartment is getting bug-bombed this weekend. I'm planning on moving my bearded dragon to a smaller terrarium so that it's easier to move him out for the day, but I don't want to bring him back at the end of the day and place him in his old terrarium that's been in the apartment while it was being bug-bombed.  I plan on putting some plastic over it. Is that enough to know that the tank is safe for me to put him in again? He licks things in his tank quite often, so I don't want him ingesting any of the poison. Would scrubbing the tank with soap and water be enough?  How do I make sure the tank is safe after the bug-bomb? "
71,Can corn snakes see everything?,Can a corn snake see everything? It seems that my corn snake acts like he can actually see me. If I move somewhere in the room he will look right at the direction I am at. I mean snakes like to do things in the night but if corn snakes or any snake can't see then how are they able to kill their prey? 
72,What causes a dog to lunge at an unknown child and how should the owner respond?,"I have a 2.5 year old pitbull/boxer mix.  He is a rescue dog, and is extremely aggressive towards other dogs (and I will probably be asking many questions about that).  However, he has always been very good with people, especially women and children.  He gets along great with my nephews and my sisters.  A few weeks ago, however, he was diagnosed with heartworm.  He has not yet received his first immiticide injection, but he is being kept relatively ""quiet"" under vet's orders.    This seems to have made him more aggressive.  He is now - seemingly randomly - lunging at people and bikes when we're out on walks.  Just today, a young girl (roughly 10 years of age) was walking by us on the sidewalk, and he lunged at her. I kept him on a short leash, and when he tried to jump again, I pushed him (rather forcefully, I admit) in the chest, knocking him over.  I don't condone violence against animals, but I was angry he would be so aggressive towards a young child. So my question is two-fold:   Is this newly aggressive behavior towards people a result of his lack of exercise, etc., or is it him becoming more protective towards me? How should I have reacted in this situation? Should I try to calm him with pets and praise? Should I ""rain treats""? Or should I be firm and forceful about not doing that again?   The second question is very important to me, because my natural instinct is to protect the other person.   "
73,Is corn based food bad for my dog?,"I've read that corn based food could be harmful to dogs. Is this true? If so, what would be a good alternative? "
74,Can cats safely eat raw meat?,"Is it safe to feed my cat raw meat, or should we cook the meat first? Or should we stick exclusively to factory produced cat food instead? "
75,My friend is allergic to only some of my cats; why is that (and how do I mitigate for future cats)?,"A friend has an allergic reaction to touching some but not all of my short-haired cats. (He does not have any issues with just being in the same room; petting or holding the cat is what sets it off.  He also did not react to the one long-haired cat I've had.) In one case he reacted to one of a pair of littermates but not the other. All of the cats eat the same food and live in the same indoor environment. What characteristics of the cats affect this? Short of bringing my friend with me to the animal shelter, is there anything I can do to minimize this consideration when adopting a new cat? "
76,How much exercise should a young cat be getting?,I have 2 young cats (1.5 years and 8 months). How much activity should they be getting during the day? They seem to be most active in the early morning and then settle down for the majority of the day for naps which I assume is normal for a cat.   How long each day should I try to get them to play apart from their chasing of each other? 
77,"Why do cats lick plastic bags, and is there any harm in it?","Most of my cats (past and present) have liked to lick plastic trash bags and grocery bags. Assuming that they are not tearing off bits of plastic and swallowing them, but just licking, is there any harm in this? What are they getting out of this -- is it just a texture thing, or are they leeching some chemical out of the plastic, or what? "
78,"How old is my non-kitten, non-senior cat?","What do people look for when estimating the age of a cat who is full-grown and not yet obviously elderly?  Both of my cats came from a shelter and the shelter's age estimates differed significantly from my vet's estimates.  When I asked my vet about that she said it's hard to know and she was going on a gut feeling.  And previously I had an experienced vet under-estimate a cat's age by more than five years.  I understand that cats don't develop gray hair like dogs do, and dental condition seems to depend as much on prior cleanings as on age itself.  What other clues to age are there and how reliable are they?  Per request in a comment, here are photos:          Cat #1 (at least 6)                            Cat #2 (estimated at 4-7 years)    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "
79,What can I do to ease my dogs' fear of loud noises?,"Whether it is my Black Labrador or my parents' American Eskimo, the sounds of thunder, fireworks and sometimes random loud noises can send them into a bit of a panic mode. They shake for an extended period of time, pant, drool, and scratch at the floor. They seem inconsolable and human contact doesn't seem to help them relax.   What is the best way to handle dogs when you cannot control the sounds?   Is there medication I can give them when I know that a thunderstorm is approaching?    Will it help to put on music or other sounds I can broadcast to try to mask the disturbing sounds (barring lightning hitting a tree in the backyard, which would make even me shake and scratch at the carpet for it a bit. :-))? "
80,How can I keep my cat stimulated when she's stuck inside the house during winter?,"My cat is vehemently an outside cat. When she's stuck in the house for more than a few hours she starts clawing at the back door and yowling.  Here's the problem: I live in Massachusetts, where the winters tend to be long and cold. She'll still yowl about going outside, and she doesn't believe me when I tell her that she really doesn't want to go out. So, I open the door, she sticks her head out, and nopes right back inside (occasionally she actually will head out for a while, in 20 degree F (~ -7°C) weather, no less).  Anyway, a few weeks of this and she starts to go stir-crazy. Climbing the walls, jumping on and off of shelves, mauling carpets and the like. So, what can I do to keep her from getting bored? As far as toys go, her tastes are...rather interesting. I've never been able to get her to pay attention to a laser pointer for more than 10 seconds, and she ignores the vast majority of the toys that we bring her. Every so often she'll get a hankering for catnip, but that's highly inconsistent. we've had limited success with a few toy mice. Really, the only thing that will get her attention most of the time is string/yarn, but after a few weeks of winter, she decides that my fur-lined leather gloves absolutely must die - seriously, I have to hide them, or the next thing I know she'll be prancing off with one of them.  What else can I try?  "
81,Should my cat follow daylight savings?,"I feed my cat twice a day: once in the morning and once in the evening. He is of the type that is always willing to eat, so I try and maintain a strict feeding schedule by feeding him exactly at 7am and then again at 6:30pm. As a result, he will usually be very vocal around these times.  As it gets darker in the fall, I've noticed that he thinks it is time to eat much earlier than usual. Since he can't tell time, I don't think he really cares about daylight savings time. Since the sunset presumably forces him to think that it is later than it really is, should I change his eating schedule when the clocks change? Does the sunrise/sunset have any effect on when I should feed my cat?  "
82,What are healthy treats for a house rabbit?,"My house rabbit can be rather shy around guests, and I would like to encourage her to be more friendly when people come around. I have explained to my guests that rabbits can be startled easily and they will crouch lower and move slower and quieter when going near her.  I'd like to be able to offer my bunny a treat or enticement to reward her for socialising.   What are some positive traits I should look for in a bunny treat?   What shouldn't rabbits be allowed to have as a treat? "
83,Why does my cat put toys in my shoes?,"My cat has a few favorite toys that he goes nuts for. More specifically: a plastic ball with a bell inside and a small stuffed mouse.  From time to time when I put my shoes on in the morning, I'll find one of these toys in my shoe. At first I thought it was coincidental and that it happened on accident. However, this is a recurring behavior and I have caught him in the act more than once.  Is this a common behavior? Is there any explanation for why he does this?  "
84,How can I protect a fish pond during the winter?,"We have a pond with several fish in it (koi, sturgeon, goldfish).  We live in a temperate area where the pond is covered by a layer of ice for several weeks during winter.    How can I ensure the fish survive this period?  Do I need to keep an area ice-free, and if so, how should I do this? "
85,How should I feed sturgeons during winter?,We currently have two sturgeons in our pond. I heard that they are active during winter and need to be fed.  How much do they need (in relation to their weight or number)? How often and at which time of the day should I feed them? Do I have to use different food than during summer? 
86,Why does my dog howl at airplanes?,"I noticed that whenever an airplane passes over our house, my dog starts howling and doesn't stop until the plane is a very far distance from our house.  Is this a normal behaviour?  If not what can I do to keep my dog from howling at planes? "
87,Is it safe for a dog to drink water from a stream?,"We have a small stream that cuts through our yard.  The dog enjoys drinking from it frequently even when he has a source of fresh water (from the kitchen sink) nearby.  Is it safe?  If not, is there a way to discourage him from drinking from the stream and encourage him to drink from his bowl? "
88,Whether and how to minimise physical activity of female dog immediately following desexing operation?,"For the initial days following a de-sexing operation, vets often instruct an owner to try to minimize a female dog's physical activity.  There might be, for example, 10 days between the operation and when stitches are removed.    However, dogs often have a mind of their own, and once the anesthetic wears off, they can start behaving just like normal.  Unfortunately, such normal activity (running, jumping, chasing other dogs, cats, etc.) might cause problems with the stitches.  Questions   How important is it to minimize the physical activity of a female dog in the days immediately after de-sexing? What are useful strategies for minimizing such physical activity?  "
89,Why do cats love sleeping on cardboard?,"Every cat I have owned has loved to sleep in cardboard boxes of any size. It could be a plain box, a sheet of cardboard, an old cookie box... Why do they do this?  Is there some smell they like?  Is there a chemical product in cardboard that attracts them? "
90,Is it safe for my cat to lick my skin when it has lotion on it?,"After I've put lotion on following a shower, my cat likes to lick my arms, even several hours later.  It does seem to matter which brand of lotion I use, though I haven't tried many.    What is in the lotion that attracts the cat's tongue?    Are the ingredients of the lotion safe for the cat?   "
91,Cats and string: will a toy make this better or worse?,"My current cats are both fascinated by shoelaces.  (I've never had this problem before.)  For shoes not currently being worn, if I don't keep them hidden away behind a closed door the cats will bat the laces -- and the shoes -- around.  This is unhelpful at 3AM.  For shoes being worn, they will sometimes dive after the laces.  I have string toys that we regularly play with.  Now I'm wondering if that's the problem: can my cats understand the difference between the toy and the shoes?  Should I be increasing my use of the toy (to try to direct them to what they should be using), or should I stop using it entirely in hopes that the cats will forget about string?  Both cats are neutered male adults; one is somewhere between 3 and 6 and the other is somewhere between 5 and 7 (all approximate). "
92,What is the optimal age to neuter a male dog?,"It seems de-sexing a male dog will assist in preventing undesirable behaviors that can surface with an entire male dog; for example aggression, roaming, cocking the leg to urinate.  Is this true?  If so what is the optimal age to de-sex a male dog to help prevent the onset of such behaviors? "
93,Are there any health or behavioral issues specific to tripod (3-legged) dogs?,There is a very sweet dog at the shelter that was in an accident and only has 3 legs. Are there any specific behavioral or health issues I should take into account when deciding whether or not to adopt him?  Are there any activities he won't be able to participate in? 
94,What can I do if my puppy is hyperactive?,"About a month a go I got a 8 week male dachshund and ever since the first days he seemed overexcited. Jumping up, chasing my cat around, excessive licking when someone pets him and so on.   At the beginning I assumed that it was because he wasn't getting enough exercise. (He didn't have all his shots so I couldn't walk him and we live in a flat) A month later, he got his shots and for the last week I've been walking him twice daily for 30-60 minutes each time and his behaviour hasn't changed.   For example, last night we came back from a 60+ minute walk and as soon as we came back he started running around like crazy and tearing apart one of his toys.  The ""problem"" seems to be around humans. When we're around or we have guests he goes crazy jumping on everyone. I honestly think I have never seen him lying down in his bed when another person is in the room. When we leave him alone in another part of the flat (because of his overexcitement), he's calm, doesn't make a sound and probably sleeps most of the time which I think only makes things worse as I would think that builds up even more energy.  Is this overexcitement? If so, what can I do to calm him down? "
95,"Is a French Mastiff dog less friendly, does it prefer fewer people around?","My sister has two dogs; one is a Labrador and one is a French Mastiff. The Labrador is friendly and likes us all. The French Mastiff ignores me most of the time, but he is excited around people other than me, like family friends.   I have fed him many times and took care of him when my sister and brother-in-law were absent, but he appears to have very little affection to no for me.   Is a French Mastiff a less friendly dog, and does it only like fewer people?  How can I change this behavior?  "
96,My kitten won't stop biting,"He is about 3 to 4 months old. I read that kittens can start biting when they start getting their permanent teeth but he bites all the time. We play with toys and I let him bite them but he keeps biting me and other people. Even when I'm sitting still and don't look like ""prey"" he'll jump at me and start biting down and sometimes it really hurts.   I've done a lot of things I've read online like clapping my hands, transferring his attention to a toy, and becoming still so you become boring for your cat to play with but I think being still when you're cat has attacked while you were still is just telling your cat it's ok to keep biting. Nothing is working. He'll bite hands, elbows, clothes, feet, toes, everything. I'll try to keep them out of his reach but he will jump and get it. He knows he shouldn't though because sometimes when he starts biting softly, I make a slight hissing noise and he immediately starts to lick instead. Then goes back to biting.   Also he sometimes starts to bite himself when I tell to stop like he's throwing a tantrum. Like ""No! I'm going to bite and if I can't bite you, I'm going to bite myself!"".   Is this a phase the he will grow out of, or is he just a biter?   How can I make him stop? "
97,My cat uses the litter box wrong!,"My cat (a three year old female) is great at going into her litter box when she needs to go.  No problems with missing it, deliberately or accidentally.  However, she seems to do it wrong.  This summary of how a cat uses a litter box says:     When cats enter the litter box they first sniff the litter. They then   dig for a short time, turn and squat near the area of digging, turn   (perhaps also smelling their waste) and dig once again. While many   cats will cover their urine or feces, others appear to ""miss"" every   time, or may even dig briefly on the floor or walls near the litter   box, leaving the urine or feces uncovered.   This matches pretty well with how I remember the cats I grew up with handling it.  My cat, however, skips the bolded step.  She will dig herself a depression, and then without turning around squat down over the pile of litter she just made.  Afterwards, she'll try to cover it up, but since it's typically higher than the rest of the litter, it doesn't work so well.  Is there any way I can teach her that missing step?  Or is this just the way she is?  If we had another cat (along with a second litter box), might she learn the ""usual"" way? "
98,One discus fish bullying the other discus,"I have two discus as recent additions to my tank. They are 3 inches each and they are the only discus I currently have in my tank. I have been observing them for a week and one of them is constantly bullying the other especially during the feeding times.   The one which is getting bullied is hiding at the corner of my tank most of the times and it's getting stressed. It's even having less food.  How can I control or handle this kind of situation?  Also, I understand discus fish do better in groups. What is the minimum number of discus that should be kept together?   The tank is 40 Gallons and is well decorated. "
99,Glassy eyes and very vocal. What does that mean?,So my boy cat has glassy eyes and has been meowing a lot for the past two days. He has been eating well and is also playing with us. I see darkened wet skin around the corner of his left eye but not the right. His water intake has gone up though. Is this sign of trouble? Is he in pain? I checked him out with a visual inspection and also by lightly pressing his tummy area but he didn't show any reaction to that.   Edit: took him to the vet. She said that he does not seem to have any immediate visible problems as such. What's the course of action if we have to determine if he does have diabetes? 
100,Why do cats purr?,"There's many questions about purring and some questions about how much purring is normal.  Why does my cat (almost) constantly purr while he&#39;s awake?  How much purring is too much purring?  What I want to know is why cats purr?   I'm not looking for anecdotal answers, or opinions, I would like well-researched answers, citing reputable sources. "
101,Can I add soda water to my tank for my plants?,I have some plants in my tropical aquarium. They're not doing too well. I suspect I may have a CO2 shortage. Can I add soda water to the tank? I've seen complicated setups for adding CO2 to water. Soda water is cheap and pouring some in the tank every few days would be really simple. Would it work? Would it be safe for the fish? 
102,Why does my cat (kitten) run away from me all the time?,"A cat had given birth to two kittens in our house. I used to keep milk in a bowl for them to drink. Some days later the mother cat and one kitten went away somewhere, but one kitten remained outside our house. It stays out at the back of our house.  I still keep milk in a bowl for it to drink and also occasionally give it meat. It's been around a month but still the kitten runs away every time I try to hold her or pet her. Even if I keep the milk in the bowl it only comes to drink when I move a little distance away. If I keep the minced meat in my hand it doesn't eat, if I keep it near me also it doesn't eat, but if I throw it a little distance, it picks it up and eats.  Why is it that the kitten hasn't become friendly yet even when I have been giving it food for more than a month?      Why is it still scared to come near me?     What can I do to gain its trust and get it to play with me? "
103,Cats and lactose intolerance,"Lactose intolerance is a common issue among cats. Mostly in new born kittens, lactase (the enzyme required to digest lactose present in milk) is released in digestive tract. But as they grow older less and less lactase is released and the cats eventually become lactose intolerant. Moreover, even many kittens find it difficult to digest cow milk which has a higher proportion of lactose.  Now it not the same in all cats. In facts there are some cats, who even after becoming adults, love cow's milk, and will happily drink it if given.  On the other hand, there are some cats who leave even mother's milk at a young age.  Now, my question is,    Is cat's breed has got something to do with this? Is the cat's geographical location got something to do with it? Is it that some evolution has taken place after cats started to live with humans and 10,000 years backs none of the cats were able to digest lactose at an adult age? Is it that some cats, simply don't like milk, but have the ability to digest lactose.  "
104,What food is best for a 2 month old kitten that has been abandoned by its mother?,"What's the recommended kitten food? How often should I feed it? (It's a kitten abandoned by its mother after 2 months.) I give it milk around every 4 hours and twice a day give it minced meatballs. Is this sufficient (considering its age of about 2 and a half months old), or should I add something more to it? "
105,How to leave my dogs back home?,"I love my dogs. But I am a bit inexperienced. I tend to over-humanize.  I live on the countryside. We have a small plot. The dogs roam freely on it. We are most of the time around, although they mostly need to be outside, sometimes we let them into the house for some time in a dedicated space, but hey themselves may get bored.  I am without a clue though about what to do when we leave. We sometimes need to leave for shopping and other diligences and doings. Happens around once a week or so. We leave for the city. This may easily take 8 to 10 hours.  What's the best way of leaving them behind? We can't have them be outside - they would follow us...  So either we leash them on a 2 metres leash outside, or we leave them inside the house, unleashed, but the space is limited and confined.  What do you think is best? Or even better ideas? Thanks  "
106,"My ""sassy"" cat keeps attacking her not-so-secret-admirer","My cat is very sweet to people; she never claws, smacks, or hisses.  I thought she was the sweetest thing in existence, until some additional animals moved into our house.  A Bengal breed cat now lives with us; he has seemingly been in love with my cat since first sight; though, she does not seem to have the same interest in him.  When the two cats meet in a common area, they will both seem very excited to see each other.    First they will sniff each other's butts. Then the male Bengal cat will sweetly groom her (in areas she likes people to scratch her) Next she'll groom the male back.  Then he'll groom her again...  But then my female will smack him in the face and hiss without any signs of being agitated before hand.   The male cat is very sensitive, and for the first few weeks, would just sit there shocked that she had smacked him. However, eventually, he started attacking her back... this is very concerning as he is twice her size.  Why is my cat being so ""sassy""?   It has been more than 3 months at this point; how can I get my cat to not be so rude and stop picking fights that should be obvious to her that she can't win?     Additional information:  Female is small domestic short hair, 6-10 years old  Male is large well breed Bengal, 3 years old  Both cats are indoor only, and very spoiled  Female despite being very sweet (to people) is quite plotting and manipulative, which makes me think she might have some ulterior motive?  Both cats are fixed "
107,Why does my cat yowl to go meet the tomcat?,"I have a 4 year old neutered female cat, the past few nights she has started screaming and yowling all night when locked inside. Tonight she woke me up 4 times, and when I went to turn on the light outside, a local tom cat was standing at the back door.   I let my dog out to scare the tomcat but my cat still wouldn't stop yowling, so I let her outside. Once outside, she continued yowling until she found the tom. Once together they ran up the street, my cat very low to the ground as if stalking him while the other cat had a relaxed posture. I thought maybe she was scaring him off however they were just facing each other normally, with no issues. What is going on? Why is my cat yowling and why does she want to meet up with this other cat?  "
108,How can I stop my 14yr old cat jumping on our pillows as we sleep?,"While my grandmother was alive her cat would sleep on her pillow next to her head and since we adopted him he has tried to carry this habit over into our house. At first it was adorable, but it has become incredibly annoying as he will sit and paw our faces while we sleep. He has very sharp claws and it wakes you up and leaves scratches. We know he doesn't mean to, but clearly he wants something. I usually go and put some biscuits down in his bowl and then he's happy. He's purring very loudly too.  We were putting him outside at night, but he has had some health problems recently, namely diabetes, constipation, and weakened back legs (this has got better). He has also been fighting with a neighbourhood cat, which left him with puncture wounds and he had to have antibiotics. This was probably because he was unable to defend himself due to his weakened state. For the time being, putting him outside is not an option. We have also tried shutting him in the kitchen but he will sit and scratch for hours, also waking us up. I can sleep any time, anywhere, and get by on very little sleep but my partner is not - she often has 5am starts and gets very broken sleep.  Has anyone had a similar experience? Is there anything we can do to deter him from jumping on our pillows? We don't mind him sleeping in the room or at the bottom of the bed. "
109,Are candles scented with fragrance oils safe for birds?,"Candles that use paraffin wax are dangerous for birds because they produce smoke that is especially unhealthy for birds to inhale. Soy and beeswax candles with lead-free wicks are the item of choice for bird-owners who still wish to light candles. However, these are often unscented.  I am interested in purchasing soy candles that are scented using natural oils. Would these be harmful to my bird?  UPDATE I emailed the company asking what fragrance oils they used. Understandably, they did not tell me the exact oils (as I'm sure they want to keep their recipe secret), but they did tell me some of their oils contain phthalates. Is this harmful? "
110,Green water in aquarium,"So my 45 gallon tank water has a greenish tinge to it.  I assume its algae, as I put it below a window.  Even with the blinds closed, Im sure it gets some sunlight causing the algae to grow.  I got a green killing machine to try to fix the issue, however its been 9 days and I see no visible change.  It says it works for tanks up to 50g, so it should work.  Do I just need to let it run longer?  Or perhaps I need to get a larger capacity model like this? "
111,Feeding Mashed Green Peas To Discus,"I have been feeding my juvenile discus (3 inches each) and other cichlids in my tank with a wide variety of food like pellets, flakes, bloodworms, beef heart mix etc (4 feedings a day). As all my feedings include more protein intake, the chances of constipation is more and I have observed this with a couple of my fish with swollen tummies.   Based on my online study, feeding mashed peas to cichlids (appx. 3 to 5 feedings in two days a week) will help them to clean their tummies and make them more healthy. I have tried this and it helped me but would like to know the good practice in feeding them.  Is feeding mashed peas good for discus along with other cichlids? How often should i feed them in a week?

113,Friendship between a boxer and puppy pitbull,"I am worried about the relationship between my 4 year old boxer dog and my new pitbull puppy (3 months), which I buy today, because when I take my pitbull puppy to my apartment, my boxer kept looking at him and started to bark a lot, then separate them, tie the boxer to a tube and thus could do nothing to the puppy (I was terrified that my boxer could hurt her).  The boxer has always been too aggressive with the puppies, he still sees them and wants to beat them.. I really do not know how I could make them friends, my boxer and my little pit bull.  Could there be a good relationship between them?  What can I do? "
114,How to determine if a cat can squeeze through a gap?,"I have a type of window that lets me use a small hook to hold just a small gap open at the top and bottom corners (the window opens sideways). The gap is about 5 cm (2 in) and, if I use considerable force, I can stretch it to 7.5 cm (3 in).  How can I determine if the cat will be able to squeeze through it?  And is it likely to have enough strength to bend a double-glazed wooden window to get an extra inch?  EDIT: the cat is very slim. "
115,My dog can't stop licking his paws,"My dog recently developed this mania where he won't stop licking his front paws, not the thick skin under it, but rather the fur as in the ""back of his hands"" and along the legs.    He's always licking the fur, and the noise of him licking it is making the entire family crazy, like the sound of a kid chewing gun right next to your ears. It's like he's bored and that's his favorite entertainment.  The noise is not the only thing, the real problem this causes is that he is becoming increasingly bad-smelly because of the dry saliva that stays on the hairs. We recently took him to a hairdresser for washing and brushing, and only one week after it, he already smells as bad as before the washing.  My wife suggested it could be the food we're giving him, so we changed, but he still does that. We also got a ""perfume"" spray for animals from the pet store, and we are spraying him to get rid of the smell, especially around the area he keeps licking (maybe the taste will discourage him), but he can't stop doing it.  The vet couldn't decide a reason why he does that, so he gave us a full set of vitamins, some of which I've never heard of before (vitamin K, anyone?), and of course no help (otherwise I wouldn't be posting here).  We're really going crazy with this, so I come here to ask, anyone has experience with such problem? Any kind of suggestion would be appreciated. "
116,How much room do Neon Tetras need?,"I have a five gallon tank with a heater/bubbler/filter/light, normally with rainbow gravel in the bottom. (I am not sure how much that matters, but I figure more information is always better!)  I would love to put some Neon Tetras in it, because I think they are awesome. Is that something I can do, or would they be super sad in a tank that small? If I can do it, how many could I put in?  "
117,Why does my dog become unmanageable midway through a long walk?,"Our puppy (8 months old, Husky/Shepherd mix) is getting to be good enough on the leash that I can take him for a nice run. I live near a park with a 5K loop road, which I used to run regularly.   When I first started taking him out around the loop road, he'd jump at me and bite and try to get me to play right away, or at least at fairly arbitrary intervals. I got a good lesson in dominant walking, and a better slip lead that actually loosens again after I tug it so I can keep it high on his neck, give it a quick tug and re-orient him to following me and we can keep going. That had a huge impact--he's way, way more manageable. My pace is pretty slow, he seems to handle it very comfortably, and we stop for water.   But since the walking lesson I've noticed that about 2/3 to 3/4 of the way through, he still gets really unmanageable. He tries to jump on me and bite playfully, but he forgets his bite inhibition entirely. The other day he did this really manic digging for a few minutes. Just scraping at the soil with dirt flying and shaking his head and jumping around. In general, it seems like he just gets manic and bonkers, jumping around and barking at me.  It occurred to me (this might be obvious to everyone else?) that 5K might just be too long for him to run. Do I need to find a shorter route, or is there something else going on? "

122,Dog suddenly lunges at other dogs after brief introduction,"My boyfriend and I recently adopted a dog with some issues. We know that she was exposed to domestic violence in her previous home. One side note before I explain the issues: We are scheduled to see a highly regarded trainer who specifically works with difficult dogs, and most likely will see her for several sessions. I came across this site after searching for this particular issue and couldn't find an answer so I figured I'd ask. My point by saying this is that I am not looking for some magical answer to ""fix"" my dog on this forum. Just looking for more info on what might be happening.   So the dog is extremely sweet with most people. She gets upset and barks/snarls/lunges when someone unexpectedly comes to our house, but as soon as we greet them and let her sniff their hand, she stops barking and does the tail/body wag. If she is unable to sniff them, she will continue to get more and more aggravated, barking and snarling at them. The other day we went to a full-service gas station and she acted like she wanted to tear the attendant apart because he was standing right next to the car and talking to me.   The other issue she has is with other dogs. So far we haven't purposefully introduced her to any dogs because we know she is reactive and wanted to wait for the training session to find out how to properly train her. However, we had an unexpected run-in with a family member's dog. We were at someone else's house and this family member came over with their dog, without us knowing. The dog came running in and saw our dog, and came over to meet her. Our dog at first was friendly, they sniffed each other's faces for a second, then sniffed each other's back sides. But after a few seconds of this, our dog suddenly became very still and rigid, growled for a second, and then started attacking. She didn't actually bite the other dog, but they were going around in circles until the other dog had a chance to run away and we grabbed our dog.   Is this a common thing? I've only been finding stories about dogs who are aggressive towards other dogs immediately upon seeing them. In this case, our dog is not aggressive at first, she seems very interested and friendly. It's only after the initial introduction that she seems to freak out and snap at them. What might be going on? I can try to provide any other info that might be helpful.  "
123,Why does my Bearded Dragon attack my hand when putting food in his cage?,Why does my Bearded Dragon attack my hand when putting food in his cage? I feed my bearded dragon Greens and live worms and give him distilled water.

125,How long can a cat live?,"I have heard that the average life expectancy of a domestic cat in the United states is 6.1 years. I've also heard that there have been cats that have lived for over thirty years. Is there a way to put an educated guess on how much longer my 13 year old cat will live?  She is a small (7 1/2 lb.) domestic shorthair. She showed up at our door as a kitten of less than 6 months. She had 5 litters of kittens, and then was spayed at three years of age. She has never been allowed indoors, but has free access to our large barn. She has never had any health issues, and her eyes and teeth are in very good condition. She eats whatever cat food is on sale, plus meat scraps from the kitchen and a variety of rodents. She is a very easygoing patient cat and very good with small children. She is not (has never been) extremely active, but likes to hunt, follow people around the yard, and play with toys and string.  If nothing out of the ordinary happens, I feel like she should be with us a good many years yet. Is there a way to make this more than just a feeling?  "
126,How High Can I Raise My Lights?,"I have a 110 gallon reef tank being lit by metal-hallides (2x250w) and blue 4 actinic T5s.  My light schedule is T5's starting at sunrise for two hours, then MHs for 8 hours, then T5s for two.  Obviously the lights get very hot and I'm trying to reduce the water heat as much as possible; they're currently 10.5"" away.  I know LEDs would be better, but they're not in the cards right now.  The question is:  How high can I raise the lights while still being effective for photosynthesis (penetrating 31"" of water)?  Is there maybe a 4'x2' hood that could possibly focus the light straight down, allowing me to lift the lights higher?  Also, if you have a recommendation for an alternate light schedule, I'm open for suggestion. "

I'm really confused by his behavior because inside the house  I can play with him and whenever I come home ""alone"" from work, he doesn't get angry and I can even pet him. It  is only when I come home together with my parent after going out that he gets aggressive towards me. Is it because my parents stay with him at home 24/7?

129,Are there any breeds of domestic cat that are bred primarily for their intelligence?,"Are any breeds of domestic cat bred primarily for their intelligence? If so, which breed(s)?  By ""Intelligence"", I mean problem solving ability.  This would include such things as the cat attempting to open doors using the handle  where other cats would simply miaow to be let through, or turning lights on/off, or learning by example by watching another cat or human perform a task.  By ""primarily"", I mean that after consideration of the health of the kittens, the parents are selected first for their intelligence and their appearance is only considered after that, unless it is a matter of the breed's health.   I am aware that breeds like Abyssinians, Bengals and Siamese are known for their intelligence, but is the intelligence of any of these or other reputedly intelligent breeds accidental, secondary to that of appearance, or primarily selected for?

130,"Bark collars and ""shock therapy""","We're at our wits end with our dog's barking – he barks aggressively (meaning that if I didn't know him I would feel like he might be a threat if he got out) at pretty much anyone who goes by. He really goes crazy if they are walking a dog.  So far we've tried:   Consulting with a dog behavioralist who suggested a positive reinforcement regime (see @Mario's answer below for a good description of the strategy). After months of trying we haven't seen any appreciable change in his behavior. I'd really like for this to work, it seems like the ""right"" approach – but we've had almost no success with this approach. Using ultra-sonic ""birdhouses"" that are supposed to make an unpleasant sound in the area around a barking dog (the fence line in our case). It was really hard to tell, but the change, if any was very minor. Using a collar with a citronella spray. He smelled lovely but it had zero impact, we could see it spraying as he went charging at the fence in full voice. Using a Garmin Bark Limiter Deluxe shock collar (this model was recommended by a friend who found that it worked very well with her dogs). This works – he has stopped barking ""cold turkey.""   However, we've noticed other changes in our dog's behavior that make me think that the message he's getting from the collar isn't ""stop barking"" but something more like ""stop getting excited about life."" That's not what we want – he's a funny dog with a huge range of expressive vocalizations (a moan for when he sees something he wants but can't reach, whines, a very soft ""just so you know"" bark, growling when he plays, etc.), he used to get very excited when his people came home, he also seems less engaged and energetic when playing with dog friends.  This leads me to think that his barking at passers by was motivated by something in common with the other behaviors (e.g., not by defending his territory) and that he's suppressing all excitement (and thus not barking) rather than learning that extended barking is not a ""socially acceptable"" way to express his excitement.  So, I have two questions:   Does anyone know of a bark collar that allows ""fine grained"" control of when it shocks? For example, I'd like to be able to:   Adjust triggering based on bark volume/attack. Adjust triggering based on bark frequency. Set a audible or tactile warning. Be able to select the type/intensity of correction. Have a correction ""ramp"" (increasing intensity of correction with frequency or volume of barking – decaying during silent intervals).  Does anybody have ideas about how to help the dog understand that the behavior we are trying to correct is the barking (as opposed to suppressing excitement)?  "
131,Why does one of my cats attack his siblings?,"I've got 6 kittens. Mom, dad, 3 tom kittens and one female kitten. They are now 1 year old.  The female one is neutered.  First Dad left me, then another kitten. Why is obvious. One of the kitten, a big one, terrorize all his brothers.  Finally another 1 year old kitten is gone and I panicked. Now, every day, I got to travel 400m, calling that ""lost kitten"" and pretty much bring it back to the house. Which is kind of silly.  All because my biggest kitten is mean to him. Yet, there are plenty of other kittens that do well and just stay outside my house just fine without picking a fight with my biggest kitten.  Why? They are brothers and used to play together. I mean, I am nice to my own bro, we hunt for mates together. Why is my tom cat so different?  Basically I want to ask why one of my tom cat is much more mean to his own brother than to other tom cats. "
132,My cat is extremely picky,"I have a cat that is at an older age (we don't know her age, we only know she is older than 12 years). She always liked to eat and would eat anything you give her. The last two months this changed. She doesn't want to eat her food but asks for it. Every time we give her food, she smells it and starts to ask for food again without touching the food.  We went to the veterinarian and she said that nothing was wrong with her health. She looks good and there didn't seem to be a problem elsewhere. She said to try different foods. Most of the time if we give something new, she eats from it, but two days later she doesn't like it anymore. You'd think she would eat if she was hungry enough but she went from 4 kilos to 3 kilos so she is losing a lot of weight.  It is now for a long period very warm for Belgium, normally we don't have such warm weather for such a long time, could that be a cause? It is not that she can't eat, she seems just to be very picky. The vet also said that all cats love cat food with tomatoes in it, but that also doesn't work...  Anyone has some tips and tricks to try? "
133,Cat licks face and ends it with a strong bite to the nose -- how to prevent it?,"my cat is very affectionate and each morning he will lick my face, purring happily until my bath is done per his standard. Then suddenly he will bite my nose, hard, and lock down on it, sometimes digging Into the soft part of the nostril. I am often asleep when he does this so it isn't in response to over stimulation or rough play. Ive tried a firm ""no"", pushing him off me immediately and no engaging afterward, blowing in his face while he's biting me but nothing stops his habit and it's even difficult to get him to release my nose. I love the face baths but hate the harsh ending. He also does the same licking bath to my boyfriend but doesn't bite him in the end. Why just me and how do I stop it? How do I prevent these very hard love bites? "
134,Goldfish swim bladder disease? Please help,"  Hi all. Apologies in advance for the long post. Looking for any help I can get please. I cleaned my goldfish tank last night and went to bed early, this morning when I went to feed him I found he is just floating as in the picture. He’s definitely still alive (gills moving) and when I go to the tank he starts smacking his lips (always has for me and often bangs into the tank in a way that seems like excitement), but he’s not moving around or swimming, just lying limp, he will occasionally flick his body to get away from the edge of the tank and he is only using the fin that is still submerged. From what I’ve seen online he’s probably suffering from swim bladder? Although I didn’t notice any changes in his behaviour the last week. I’ve tried to feed him peas but he’s just spat them straight out, he’s always let me feed him by hand and even likes to be petted gently on the head (I say he likes it as he never swims away and comes up to my finger and bops it with his head), he loves his food and hasn’t pooped or eaten since I cleaned him out last night. He usually instantly poops in his new water. I always just use water to clean the tanks as I’m terrified of chemicals sticking on the tank, and I check the water in his tank, always making sure the ph level is right as he’s old now, everything was normal last night, I also do water changes daily. So far today I have panicked a lot then followed steps I found online to create his hospital tank, increasing the water temp and adding the salts, I’ve also put some of his disease medicine. It’s early days but I’m just wanting to make sure I’m doing everything right. A little history of him: I’ve had him for 5 years now but he’s about 8-9 years old, he was my ex’s and I took him in. He lived in a bowl for the first 3/4 years of his life 😞🤦🏼‍♀️ (with the ex) and when I took him in I got him a proper tank, I didn’t know much about goldfish then but I immediately started noting problems that he never had in the bowl, I was never sure if the move is what has caused this all. He started to get that cotton wool skin and red blotches every time I cleaned his tank, he always reacts well to treatment and has always made a full recovery and since monitoring the water for nitrate and ph levels he hasn’t had it as much, but still every now and then. He has suffered with some sort of imbalance before, I saw him slightly veering off to one side and so I immeditaly put him in fresh water and I was given a “disease safe” solution to treat him with, this helped and he recovered pretty quick, within a day. He’s normally a very lively fish, he started banging on the tank and smacking his lips as soon as I walk into the room and he darts all around his tank as though he’s excited, I really do love him so much. I guess people will say he’s just a fish but I never knew fish could have so much personality and Mr.Fish really does ❤️  I’ve been out for most of the weekend just popping home to feed him, he’s usually fine when this happens, but shamefully because I’ve not been in very much I don’t know if he’s been having symptoms for the last few days, I didn’t notice anything wrong last night or when I’ve popped back though. I’m just so worried about him now and I don’t know what to do? I’ve seen so much conflicting advice on the internet, advising to just euthanise, so I’m not sure at all. Also worried that it looks like he’s got a bruise on the side that is exposed? I’ve been gently encouraging water over it to make sure he doesn’t dry up on that side. He looks so bloated and stuffed up, he’s obviously not pooped all night as there’s none in his tank. If this were a cat or dog I’d massage the stomach but I obviously can’t do that for him. So I’m not sure if this is constipation either. Which leads me to not knowing whether I should fast him for two days?  Any help much appreciated, and if I’m doing anything wrong please tell me. Thank you for taking the time to read my post x  Edited to add: Mr Fish comes up to the surface of his water whenever I come near him, and he does what I call a bark (smacking his mouth and flapping about, very noisily) till I give him some attention, he usually does it wanting food and then swims off and stops if I don’t give him any. I wasn’t sure if he’s been swallowing air when doing this? And I’ve always fed him flakes as my ex did and the vet told me not to change the diet as he was already 4/5 when I asked. So confused please help. "

136,My rabbit died yesterday not sure if its Heart Attack or maggots,Hi My rabbit died yesterday&lt; I had him for 5 years. I noticed the rabbit was full of poop (poop stuck to his bottom?). He had been attacked by flies and the vet removed the visible maggots. The rabbit was not obese.   The vet told me he was injecting the rabbit with antibiotics and some other medicine to kill any remaining maggots.   Took the rabbit again to the vet for follow up and he found more maggots inside the testicles and this time the bunny had an operation and his testicles were removed because the maggots were inside the skin.   2 days later I took the rabbit back to the vet for a follow up and also the vet said he was going to put laser on the rabbit to speed up the drying of the wound.   While I was in the waiting room the vet technician comes out with my bunny dead. He said my rabbit died from a heart attack. I do not understand. Can this be possible? Or could it be something went wrong with the laser?  I am trying to get some sense on what happened. The rabbit supposedly did not have anymore maggots. He had even undergo an operation. The rabbit was very skinny but was still eating  how could he die when i took him for a follow up and laser?  He died 3 days after his operation at the vets office.  I don't believe the vet.  Something went wrong when my rabbit was inside while I was waiting for him outside in the waiting area. Or maybe there were still maggots inside that kill him and it was a coincidence that he died at the vets office?

139,Can goldfish be trained?,"I've recently got a family of goldfish and I want to encourage them to be interactive. Can they be trained?    Background:   I have 3 comet goldfish.   During the transition to their tank, I must have scared them. It seemed like they had PTSD for a few days, always swimming away from nearby humans and ""cowering"" in the far corner.   I want them to love me, and I figure food is the best way. My plan is to hold my fingers over the water for a little while before and after feeding so they associate my fingers with food.   In time, they will come to me and follow my fingers around the outside of the tank, even if I'm not holding food.  Is that possible? "
140,Male cat attacking female cat,"We have 2 cats 1 male &amp; 1 female 8 months old now. Both are siblings and they were very attached to one another as we separated them from mom when they were only 2 months old. I recently neutered my female cat around 15 days back. In the whole process of neutering we kept both cats in separate rooms. Now my male cat is attacking female cat. What would be the reason? we r still using medicine on female cats stitches, does that smell is the reason for attacking male cat? Please let me know how to solve this problem. "

143,Is hand feeding my horses hay enough to supplement their feed if my grass is not enough to sustain them?,"I have two horses (hacks) on a 5 acre property. It has grass, but it is not enough to sustain them both.  Is hand feeding them hay enough to supplement their feed or do I need to use hard feed?  What are the signs that they need more? "
144,Is there a substrate for a Redfoot tortoise that won't retain excess moisture?,"I have a South American tortoise (a Redfoot) that lives on sphagnum moss bedding. I have given some thought to switching her to a topsoil-based substrate, but I'm concerned that such a base will retain too much moisture.  Are there reptile-safe plants that I can add to the soil to maintain the right level of moisture as not to grow mold? Alternatively, are there other substrate materials that might make more sense in this environment? I like that the sphagnum moss dries out fairly effectively, but it would be nicer if the soil could retain the moisture and not crumble to bits over time. "
145,Why does my cat wash her paws in her water?,"My cats' self-filling water bowl has started getting dirty rather quickly since we got a new kitten (who's now about 6 months old). There's quite often a bit of cat litter at the bottom of the bowl, so I assume that she's been washing her paws in it after using the litter box.  She seems to otherwise have the normal feline aversion to getting wet in any way, so it's odd to me that she'd be intentionally doing it. Is there anything I can do to break her of this habit? Should I just get rid of the self-filling bowl since I need to empty and wash it every day anyway? "
146,My pet snake seems to have some sort of bugs crawling on its face; do I need to worry?,"There are tiny little white things crawling across my pet snakes face, and even on its eyes.  What are they, and what should I do about them?  Are they harmful? "
147,How to determine the amount of fish that can live in a pond?,"How many fish can live in a pond? As ponds are normally not the natural habitat of the fish that live in them (ie: goldfish, kois and sturgeons in my case), how do I determine how much is too much or what can be considered a species-appropriate number? "
148,Cooling a goldfish tank during summer,"During the peak of last summer we had several goldfish that died after several days of hot weather and I suspect it was related. According to the Goldfish article on Wikipedia:     Extremely high temperatures (over 30°C (86°F) can also harm goldfish   The ambient temperature sat over over 40°C (104°F) during the day and only dropped to a little under 30°C (86°F) overnight so it's almost certain the tank temperature would have exceeded that amount.   Doing some research I see there are some commercial tank cooling products available although they are relatively large / expensive and this is only a once or twice a year event in my area. A few thoughts I'd considered are:   Setup a fan pointing across the tank as a form of evaporative cooling. I assume though that would cool the top layer of water more than the bottom and I wasn't sure if the differential in temperature may make things even worse? Introduce a large amount of tap water that I measured as a bit under 20°C (68°F) because it comes from a cooler mountain range. Considering that would need to be treated quickly chemically I could see that also having potential downsides. Add ice cubes that have already been treated, but I imagine that could result in them floating on top and mainly cooling the top portion of the tank.   I wondered if anyone has been in a similar position and can recommend a good alternative or suggest expert opinion on which of the above options may be best? "
149,What's a suitable way to drive with a big dog in the car?,"I drive a Honda Crosstour. I was wondering what I can use to make sure that the my dog, a  german shepherd,  can be kept safe and comfortable in the trunk/backseat and also prevent any damage to the car, from for example scratching.  Should I pad it with particular material? Is there a special type of seating material or restraint recommended for this case? "
150,How can I prevent my cat from extending his claws when being petted?,"When I pet my cat, he often curls his toes, and extends / retracts his claws. I guess it's a sign that he enjoys getting petted, however this is not something I appreciate when he's lying on furniture and his claws scratch and pierce the surface.  Normally, he doesn't cause damage to furniture; he likes his scratching post, but this is an exception.  Is there any way to tell my cat to avoid extending his claws when he is being petted, or is the only way to avoid damage to always take him on my lap (not that I appreciate him clawing my clothes either)?  Is there another way to prevent this? "
151,How can we prevent our cats from scratching on our chair?,"My wife recently had a chair reupholstered, after the cats had damaged it to the point it was looking really shabby.  When she contacted the restoration company, she found out that the chair is actually quite old, and quite valuable.  She spent a lot on repairing the chair, and understandably does not want all that work to go for naught.    We have scratching posts positioned around the house, and they get some use, but for some reason that one chair is the prefered spot for scratching, even with the new upholstery.    At this point, the chair is covered in tin foil and double-sided tape, to keep the cats from scratching at it, but this is obviously far from ideal.  Is there a better strategy?  Preferably one that doesn't leave our furniture looking like a candy waiting to be unwrapped? "
152,When leaving my dog alone is it better to leave some lights on or all off?,I always ask myself what is better. Leaving some lights on wouldn't prevent the dog to have a nice sleep? Leaving all lights off woudn't make her to be affraid and scared? 
153,should cat's be given names which end with a vowel?,"I have a veterinary book that states the name given to a cat should end with a vowel. The paragraph in which I read this is here:      Naming your new pet should be fun and involve the entire family. You can even find at your local bookstore entire books that are dedicated to choosing the right name for your cat. Stick to names having two syllables; This will allow it to differentiate between its name and those one syllable commands you may choose to teach it. You can further set its name apart from potential commands or reprimands by adding a vowel sound to the end of it.   Does anybody know if this is true? Has anybody read or heard this anywhere? If so, where?  The book is called The Illustrated Veterinary Guide for Dogs, Cats, Birds, and Exotic Pets. It is written by Chris  C. Pinney, DVM. It's not as if you are going to run out and buy the book just to read about this though.  I want to know if cats should given names ending with a vowel, and if giving them names of two syllables would help. "
154,How to clean/wash litter box that had clay litter?,"We recently switched from a corn based litter to a clay based one bc of recommendations for clumping and odor control.   However I read that the litter should not be flushed because they may expand in the pipes.   So, now I'm paranoid about doing a full cleaning the litter box...I.e dumping the litter and washing the box.   When I dump the contents there are still some damp smudgy stuff on the walls. I would scrape off as much as I can.   Then I take it outdoors to rinse and dump the water bc I don't want to introduce a speck of clay litter into my pipes.   Is this the way people clean their litter boxes?  What about the 'bacteria' that may be left on the ground, etc. ?  What's a safe (to pipes) and sanitary way to wash/clean the box? "

158,Alternatives to Renal Dog Food?,"I have a 9 year old dog that has been on a renal dog food for over 8 years (Royal Canin), as she has some minor kidney issues. I was recently reviewing our budget, and was reminded how much this type of dog food costs.  I'm wondering what are some affordable renal dog food alternatives? I understand of course that my vet should be involved in any choices I make, but I'd like to be informed about alternatives when we discuss this.  I'm willing to prepare food myself from other sources (e.g. raw foods, cook things, etc), and am open to any suggestions. Thanks!  Note: Currently she eats Royal Canin Renal "
159,Can you use Monistat on a dogs paw for yeast infection?,"My mom's dog was seen by an ""in n out vet"", a shot clinic basically. When the vet asked her "" besides shots do you have any health concerns?"" She replied by letting him know he (Henri, her 8 yr old Coton du Tulear) chewed on his feet, and his back feet were red in color and she'd suspected a grass allergy. The vet gave her a spray (Allercain, with Bittran) for topical allergies and a bitter taste to eliminate chewing), he asked her about her food (already feeding a limited ingredient diet- so no change necessary), and suggested adding salmon oil to his food daily, and giving him a half of a Zyrtec daily hidden in a pill pocket or treat.  He's been on this recommended combination for a month with no change, and she said it actually appears worse. His foot is now balding in some places, still red, inflamed and chewing has not stopped. It's especially darker red in between his toes, which suggests to me he has yeast on his feet.  I have experience with AND know you can use Monistat on yeast infections in dogs' ears BUT dogs can't chew on their ears. Maybe that's why it's safe??  Does anyone know if it is safe to put Monistat on a place that may end up being licked??  There's a high and very probable chance of him continuing to chew until it clears up. If he can't be treated with Monistat or an athlete foot cream, she knows he will have to return to the vet (non clinic), but was hoping to try something more affordable, without being charged for ""extras"". She also mentioned using lemon juice, that it's a natural antifungal and would be sour in taste to keep him from chewing, but I fear it would sting pretty bad any areas he's chewed raw.  If anyone has experience with this, stories of experience included with answers are appreciated.   If it helps, I'll have her send me pics of his feet to share with the PetsEx. Community. Thanks in advance!  I should also add the vet did not perform a physical and my mom said he didn't thoroughly examine the foot (guess it wasn't part of the package- not sure), and he has no fleas, or hair loss or redness anywhere else, just back feet and one is worse than the other.  "
160,Replacing bottom of a bird cage,"I inherited an old parrot cage and its base needs to be replaced. The cage is pretty much a steel box, ~2 feet long and wide and ~3 feet high. The metal part of the cage doesn't have a bottom grate - it is only 5 sided, not 6. The base of the cage is made of plastic, designed to fit the steel cage and a simple plastic tray that can be lined with paper and removed for cleaning. It's a lot like this:     The plastic base is very brittle and is falling apart. As more pieces break every time I try to move it or clean it, it's increasingly flimsy and held together with duct tape.  Here are some pics of the cage's plastic base which I want to replace. The tray that slides out has already broken into pieces. There's no identification on the base, just a place where a sticker once was on the inner side and a half-ripped, faded and illegible bar code sticker on the bottom.        How can I replace the base of this cage? Any suggestions on where to buy just the base? Is there a DIY option - I thought of building a simple open-topped wooden box for the steel cage to fit on top of, but I'm not sure if a wooden base is OK for the bird and for cleaning? If all else fails and I get a new cage entirely (maybe this is for a separate question) - what's the best way to recycle this old bird cage? Throw out the broken brittle plastic and scrap the steel cage, or is there a better way to recycle/upcycle this thing? "
161,Help with Fishless Cycling with Live Plants,"I have some questions regarding fishless cycling of a 65L tank I have set up 2 days ago. Please bear with me.  I set up the tank with tap water, and added an appropriate amount of Seachem Prime to dechloronate. The tank has a HOB filter and a set of LED lights (for full details of tank set, see here.  The tank has some amazon frogbit and hornwort floating around, as well as tiny amounts of duckweed. I accidentally also added in a tiny dash of liquid fertiliser NOT designed for an aquarium (see here). Will this fertiliser harm any fish I put in there in the future? Will it affect cycling? Also, will the ingredient ""biuret"" harm the fish? I tried looking this up to little success; all I know is biuret is a condensation of urea or something.  I live in Australia, and cannot add ammonia into the tank. Instead I popped in some goldfish pellets and cichlid pellets which I had lying around from years ago. The idea is for this to decompose and produce ammonia, to start the nitrogen cycle.  Today I went to the pet store and was advised that I need to add Seachem Stability for my cycle to go well. I have not done this. Can anyone advise me if Stability is required or beneficial for cycling?  Also, I did a quick ammonia, nitrite, and nitrate test today with an API 5 in 1 kit. All showed values of zero (I even re-tested the nitrate in case I didn't shake the bottle enough, and still zero).  Can anyone tell me why all my values are zero? I thought that nitrates should not be zero after a cycled tank. Is my tank cycled? It's only been 2 days. If my tank isn't cycled, why is my ammonia and nitrite reading zero? Are my plants sucking up all the ammonia?  One last thing is that the water of my aquarium is cloudy. Is this bacterial bloom? Algae? I've also noticed on the fish pellets a white halo of something growing on it. Is this fungus?  I've never cycled a fish tank before, and I really hope to get it right this time. I also have NOT conducted any water changes since setting up the tank. Please advise if this is appropriate.  To sum up:   Will a urea-based fertiliser not made for aquatic use harm fish? Will the tank cycling properly with this? Will biuret harm fish? Do I need Seachem Stability to cycle a tank or not? Why is my tank showing ammonia 0, nitrite 0, nitrate 0? Does this have to do with my plants? Is my tank cycled?' Does my tank have bacterial bloom or something else? Do I need to worry about white fuzz around my decomposing fish food? Do I need to do water changes for this fishless but slightly planted cycle?   I can't add images at this time for some reason and Stack Exchange isn't letting me add more links which is frustrating. I do have photos to show though if anyone will find them useful!  P.S. I'm planning on putting a betta in there and possibly some tank mates once things are established. "
162,My cat's food is filled with ants: should I throw it away or is there a method to remove them?,My cat's food bag is filled with ants and I'm sure I'm not supposed to give him ant filled food. So is there a method to remove the ants from the original bag or should I throw it away and get a new bag of food? Also are there any methods to keep ants away from their food bag in the first place? 
163,Is it normal for a dog's coat to change color?,"We recently adopted a 7-yr-old Chesapeake Bay Retriever/Great Pyrenees mix with a dark coat, and after about 2 weeks, my wife and I swear the fur is getting lighter, especially around his ears and neck. He eats well and seems pretty laid back, and although he sheds a lot and we've been brushing him regularly, he isn't developing any bald spots (e.g., from anxiety issues or malnourishment).  Is it normal for a dog's coat to change color, for example, with the seasons? Or is it possible for the coat to get sun bleached from only a few hours outdoors each week? It also occurred to us that maybe he was just a bit dirty before, but we gave him a bath when we first brought him home and his coat only started to seem lighter as of a few days ago.  Update: we have now had him for more than a year, and his coat has stayed about the same since that first color change a few weeks after we got him. We've fed him everything from the cheap [tex]70 for 24 lbs food (but we buy it when it is on a clearance super-sale), and his coat stays the same. I think in those first 2 weeks we had him, we were feeding him the same food that the shelter had been feeding him.  So, strangely, his drastic coat color change doesn't seem to have been related to the seasons, and it seems unlikely it was related to diet or age since it was so fast. "
164,Did my recently-adopted adult dog suddenly decide it's his duty to guard the house?,"We recently adopted a lab mix who is estimated at around 7 years old. He was first found as a stray, then was adopted for about 2 years before he was displaced from his seemingly loving family and put up for adoption again at the same shelter, where we found him. He's very well-behaved, and for the first couple days we didn't hear a single bark out of him, even when other neighborhood dogs would bark as we walked past their yards. Even at the dog park he didn't bark at the other dogs. We went about 2 weeks with pretty much zero barks, except for the time we think the cat was about to steal some of his food.  Now, on a few occasions in the past few days, he has barked while tied out in the yard. On a couple occasions he has also barked when someone was at the door, including once the other day when I returned home from work and he barked a couple times at me from inside the house.  Did he just realize this is his new home and that it's his duty to guard it? He doesn't seem to bark all the time at people outside or at the door, and he only barks 2 or 3 times, not nonstop like most of the other dogs around the neighborhood. When he barks at the door or when he's tied out in the yard, should we ignore the behavior, praise him, or try to get him to stop? "
165,Why do cats act like their food bowl is empty when there is still food left?,"So my cats - well, one more than the other - will whine and meow at me in a certain manner that I have come to recognize as, ""There is no food in the bowl.""  When they exhibit this behavior, I automatically check the food bowl.  Sure enough, there is food in the bowl, but the bottom of the bowl is visible.  Not only that, there is still plenty of food - probably enough for the day.  I know I am not the only one to notice this behavior.  There are even memes about it.      I think it is safe to say if multiple, separate cats exhibit this behavior, then it is an instinctual trait carried on from before domestication, not a learned behavior.  This is similar to cats (and other animals) walking in a circle before lying down.  However, I cant think of what that pre-domesticated behavior would be.  Any ideas? "
166,Cage for Parakeets,"We've recently added two parakeets to our family. I've been doing tons of reading and research, but I still have much more to do.  Based on my research I've determined that the cage that the pet shop sold me is too small to keep our budgies happy (but perfect for vet visits).  I love the build quality and size of the cage below, but the site doesn't list budgies in the ""built for [insert types of birds here]"" information.  Are there any experienced parakeet owners that could tell me if this is a good cage for our two new parakeets?  Here's the page in the original Spanish (we're living in Spain).  They also have an English version of the page, but it has less information.  Lastly, here's a YouTube video that shows some nice close-ups of the cage. "
167,"Cat is not eating, Fluid build up in abdomen, Ultrasound reveals mass in small intestine","I have a domestic long hair that is about 11 years old and used to be almost 24lbs.   About 6-7 weeks ago, he stopped eating and losing weight (currently around 12lbs). At first, when I put food, he licks it a little bit but doesn't eat/chew. It's like he wants to eat but doesn't. Gradually, he stopped eating altogether.   I thought it might be a tooth problem and took him to the dentist. The dentist found a resorption tooth and removed it (did not have to do a root canal). A couple of days after the surgery, he still didn't eat and was losing weight. At this point, I also noticed fluid build up in his abdomen.  The first vet I took him to did an ultrasound, gave him antibiotics, and said that the ultrasound revealed some kind of inflammation in the intestine.  The second vet also did an ultrasound and found a mass in the small intestine. They withdrew some of the mass using a needle for analysis. They told me that the analysis will reveal if he had lymphoma or not. Unfortunetly, yesterday the test results came back as ""non diagnostic"" (I think it means the test was not conclusive). They also added a feeding tube.  Both vets did extensive blood tests, nothing was found except low levels of albumin.  Yesterday, he became so weak and agitated, I took him to the ER. The doctor there said based on all of the previous history that the other 2 VETs faxed over, there is a 95% chance he has terminal cancer and that it has spreadout throughout the intestine.  They said they know it has spreadout because they can tell by the fluid and the because the rest of the intestine was not absorbing vitamins/food properly.  They said that from the ultrasound the other 2 vets did, they can see that the ""mass"" has covered all around the small intestine.  They scheduled him for surgery today where they will go in and remove the mass from the small intestine and will do exploratory surgery. They will then do analysis on the mast to see what kind of cancer it is.  They said that even with the surgery, he will not eat and will waste away.  Is there any chance that it could just be a non-benign tumor....or even just a foreign object blockage?  How can they be so sure that it has spread throughout the intestine?  From my research, it looks like cats can also have fluid build up if they don't eat. I mentioned this to the VET but they said that in this particular case, it is related to cancer.  What is the likely prognosis? "
168,"Surgeon says white plaques found everywhere in abdomen, what is it?","This is a continuation from Cat is not eating, Fluid build up in abdomen, Ultrasound reveals mass in small intestine  Basically, my cat went into surgery today to have the small intestine mass removed. He has not been eating/drinking and fluid has been building up in his abdomen.  When the surgeon went in, he did not find a mass...instead, he found a section of the intestine covered in white plaque and thickened. He also found white plaques in several other areas and all throughout the abdomen.  He also said the white plaques in the intestine was causing ""diffusion"" and fluid build up in the abdomen.  He doesn't have a definitive diagnostic of what it is.....but he thinks it could be either cancer or FIP (indoor cat only). He did take a white colored antibiotic 1 day ago.   He will be taking biopsies of the plaques and sending them to pathology which will take a week for diagnosis.  Does anyone know what this is? Is it cancer? Can we treat/cure it? "

171,Why does my cat bite my face while being affectionate?,"My cat is very very tame, she socialized well with kittens, as soon as she was old enough I got her and she's a happy cat or so it appears. I've tamed her very thoroughly, so I can hold her upside down, or even tilt her upside down, or toss her up and catch her, she seems totally comfortable with anything I do.   But when she's in a cuddly mood and I'm giving her a petting fit for royalty, she'll be laid out in my arms in some comfortable looking position purring, looking like the happiest cat on earth, and I stop and I'll be looking at her face, and she really quickly tenses up and bites my face, often running away like she knows she did something wrong. I immediately retaliate, hard, just like another cat would, to make her think twice about doing this. She doesnt bite hard enough to make me bleed, but it's an unnecessary shock at really weird timing.   Sometimes she'll be licking my face to wake me up, and I guess she thinks my face needs to be cleaned at 6AM, and I wake up, pet her a bit, she'll lick my face more and then randomly lunge and bite my face, before receiving a really good beating in return. Not really, but I make sure to hurt her as much as she did me. That seems like something she'll certainly understand as retaliation for her aggression toward me.   But I want to know why. Why, at the most intimate moments, right after she rubs her face on mine or licks me, does my cat lunge and bite my face?    Is all of her affection juse a ruse to trick me into dropping my guard??  I know there's a similar question here, but that question doesn't quite cover my situation and doesnt really have a satisfactory answer.  "
172,Do Rabbits feel pain?,"An answer at How smart are rabbits? includes the following quote and reference  Rabbits also have no or very underdeveloped pain sensing regions in their brains(source)     Even as a predator rends a rabbit limb from limb, the rabbit may not feel much pain at all, at least, not in the manner that we humans sense it. The idea that rabbits experience 'untold pain and agony' during predation, or even during butchering by humans, is not supported by science.      While prey animals are no doubt capable of feeling pain, it is the anxiety and fear that keeps the rabbit alive in dangerous situations. Problem is, beyond a certain threshold of fear, terror can literally paralyze a rabbit, completely incapacitating it. A rabbit’s high-pitched scream is a response to terror (whether logical or not), not pain.   The comment ""not supported by science"" could either mean, we have never actually done any scientific testing so there for there is no evidence. Or it could mean there have been scientific studies that prove rabbits don't feel pain. Or it could just be some ones opinion.  What is the the science around pain in rabbits as compared to humans?  "
173,Helping dog recover from death of his brother,"Two dogs. Both adopted when they were puppies from a rescue organization roughly 9 years ago. Dogs grew up together, slept together in a large dog bed, pretty much best of friends entire life.  Few nights ago one of my dogs seemed to be in a lot of pain and his stomache was swelling. His brother was crying and howling worried about him which is what caused us to investigate what was going on. Upon rushing our dog to the vet,it turns out his stomach had flipped unexpectedly and he was in extreme pain. Less than 30% chance surgery would resolve this and not leave lasting pain or effects. We made the tough decision to lay him to rest that night to stop his pain and agony.  It has been a few days and our other dog has been staying at our sons house with his two dogs (they have known each other for years and love each other). He seems very depressed and seemed to know right away that something bad had happened when we took his brother to the vet. He seems pretty lethargic and is acting like he is in remorse over his brother dying.   Question has to do with the proper steps to help him through this tough time. Currently we have him staying with my son and his dogs to give him companionship with other dogs he knows.  Some questions/ to guide the discussion are:  Should be remove all traces and scents of his brother from the house before he comes home?   How long does it take dogs to recover my the loss of a companion to their level?  Would it be a good idea to get another dog that has the same temperament as him so he doesn't feel alone at home? "
174,Should dogs eat out of raised or non-raised bowls?,"I recently had a dog that we had to put to sleep because of his stomach flipping ([website]I have been reading into many different causes and suspected causes. While there is a lot of unknowns, one that is consistently brought up is eating out of raised bowls.   I have read multiple sites that speak about dogs eating out of raised bowls (bowls on a stand or ledge about 6-16 inches above the ground) vs. bowls that are sitting flat on the ground. Various sites state that it is better for dogs to eat out of raised bowls and decreases the danger of Bloat and stomachs flipping... while others state that it adds to the danger of Bloat.   My question is simple:  Is it better to have my dogs eat out of raised bowls or have the bowls sitting on the floor? "

177,Kayaking Cat Conundrum,"Backstory  If you view my profile and peruse some of my recent questions, you will be able to figure out that a year ago I adopted a kitten that was quite different from what I had ever known before.  He has more character, energy, and rambunctiousness than all cats I've met combined.  The last year has been a unique learning experience for me.    I have had to continually seek ways to stimulate his brain and find outlets for him.  My vet and her staff have helped with suggestions, as has pets.se.  Some of his daily food is delivered via puzzles; mostly home-made from cardboard tubes.  I've built caves out of old blankets and boxes and put things inside to explore.  I bought a set of Lincoln Logs just to have safe and sanctioned destruction; my towers used to last mere hours, now it's up to weeks, but they all eventually fall.  Through it all, I believe the trouble-making little fuzz bucket and I have come to love each other.  Here are some other facts about my cat that may or may not be relevant.   He is mostly an indoor cat.  I have been hesitant to let him wander due to neighborhood dogs and hawks.  But I have taken him out on a harness and lead.  He completely ignores barking, lawn mowers, and other noise from beyond the chain-link fences as he merrily chases insects and paws at weeds.  He squirms a little when I put the harness on, but as soon as it is on, he goes straight to the back door and paws at it. He has a thing with water.  If I accidentally leave the toilet seat up, I will soon find water splashed all over the floors and walls of the bathroom.  He likes to go into the bathtub when it is not in use and roll around.  The water in his bowl is as likely to be splashed around as it is    to be lapped up. He is picky regarding affection.  If I come to him, he will tolerate only a little tickling and does not want to be picked up.  If he comes to me, he will cuddle up as tight as he can and totally give himself over to all kinds of tickling and rubbing.  Then five minutes later, he will leave.   The Idea  Now that he is basically an adult, a family member said to me, ""Why don't you teach him to ride in your kayak with you?""  At first I dismissed the idea as absurd.  Now, as the thought has germinated in my brain for a while, I am starting to consider it.  As autumn is currently setting in, I am packing up and winterizing all my boat gear.  But come April 2017, as the cat nears two years old, I may just see what happens.  (I've seen the moturrsikling kitteh on the interwebs, so why not?)  Officially, I am still undecided.  I am curious what suggestions this community might provide.  I've had some ideas for experimenting with his reactions and acclimating him that I have considered.  Over winter:       Bringing the kayak into the house for an hour every couple weeks.  Let him sniff at it and explore inside.  Then sit it myself, and get him to sit with me.  Put treats in it for extra motivation Get a PFD for him (possibly another question) and have him wear it at the same time the kayak is inside the house.   When spring arrives:   Take him for walks on a lead along the shoreline, letting him see and smell the concept of ""Lake."" Float the kayak in shallow water, put him inside with his PFD and on a lead, and wade along side, able to take him to shore immediately if anything goes wrong.   My questions   Should I even try it at all? Any feedback or suggested changes or improvements to my own ideas? What else can/should I do over the winter to prepare? What else can/should I do come spring before trying a full-blown ride with him?  "

180,Dog restless at night in new crate,"We've had our 15 month old Golden mix for over a year now. He's usually crated at night, and he's been sleeping well. He usually wakes up before us but doesn't make a peep till he sees us stirring - he's awesome that way.  We noticed that he tries to stretch while in the crate. As the crate is only 36 inches long and he's around 25 inches long he was not able to stretch to his heart's content. We bought a larger crate a few days ago and donated the old one to a shelter. Now at night though, he seems a little restless. Every night since he's been in the new crate, he gently barks at around 2am and wakes us up. Once we let him onto our bed, he curls up and sleeps peacefully.  Is it possible that the new crate is new big for him, that he liked the cosiness of the old one better? Or could this be a case of him 'breaking in' the new crate? We're trying to not encourage him to sleep on our bed as this could be a painful habit going forward.  Either way - are there any suggestions to help him (and us!) sleep at night? "
181,Should Aquarium fish follow seasonal changes?,"I was reading the question Aquarium lighting systems that follow seasonal changes? and I got thinking.    If an indoor fish tank has a heater, it probably holds primarily tropical fish. As the tropics are near the equator, there is little if any seasonal change in the heat or lighting.  If you have tropical fish, what impact if any do seasonal light changes have on the fish? Are there any seasonable variables other then light that might impact the well being of tropical fish?  "
182,What are the ways to prevent my tammy cat from being pregnant?,"Without changing her personality?  Can we install IUD or something?  My female cat has 4 kittens. She is  nursing her children. Why I love them all, 6 cats are too many.  Also her ""husband"" was at home when she's looking for mate outside. Is it possible that some of the kitten is her husband's kitten?  Only one look like her husband. "
183,What to do with a kitten a week after spay?,"My 5 1/2 month old kitten got spayed yesterday! The vet said to leave the e-collar on for 14 days, and to try to keep her from exerting herself too much. They recommended I keep her in a safe place where she won't be able to jump a lot until she is recovered, to allow the incision to heal. I kept her in the bathroom overnight to be safe, but she will jump at the door if she knows I'm in the apartment, so other than that I've let her roam as usual and just kept a close eye on her.  I will be out of town next weekend for three days (days 8-10 after the surgery) so I'm trying to figure out what to do. The other times I've been out of town, I've gotten a sitter to come check on her in my apartment - she seems lonely when I get back, but otherwise fine. The other option is boarding, which I did for one day at the vet's, and she seemed terrified when I got her back and took a while to unwind.  My concern is that leaving her at home with a cone and a not-totally-healed incision is dangerous, even with someone coming by once or twice a day. (Also, leaving her in small bathroom for that long seems cruel.) On the other hand, I am worried that boarding her would cause too much stress. On the other other hand, this is my first cat and I've read elsewhere that kittens are usually fine after a couple days, so maybe it's not a big deal?  What are the pros and cons of hiring a cat-sitter vs. boarding in this situation? Are there other options or concerns I should consider? "
184,"Hard to find black kitten, has something changed?","I got 3 kittens 16 years ago. I used the ""Want Advertiser"" which was a paper classifieds magazine for the local area (Massachusetts). There were tons of ads for free kittens, so I picked one and ended up taking all three that the family had, which were 3 all-black male American shorthairs.  Fast forward 16 years. One of my cats has died and the other 2 are getting older, so I am looking to get a new cat. I want to get the same type, which is an all-black American shorthair. Unfortunately, this seems impossible to do.  The Want Advertiser went out of business, so that is no longer an option. I have been checking Craigslist for 3 months and have found only 3 female black kittens, and none of the sellers returned my phone calls. Not only that there are literally 10 ISO (in search of) ads WANTING kittens for every kitten being offered. I tried going to a ""shelter"" named ""Buddy Dog"" but that was useless because they had no black kittens and all their kittens were sexually mutilated, which I do not want.  I am willing to pay any amount of money to get a local all-black kitten, but apparently that does not matter because noone breeds them. They only breed ""exotic"" cats like Bombays and Persians, so I can't buy one from a breeder.  My question is: Has something changed in the last 16 years that is making cats harder to find and obtain? If so, what changed? "

186,What is causing behaviour changes in our young adult dog?,"I have a German Shepherd dog whose name is Alex. He is a male dog and he is approaching 2 years of age in this November and  have not desexed him. The dog has never been mated with another dog. Now, Alex has been quite okay till now.  My brother warned me that  dogs can have disruptive outbursts, at times, as they grow into adulthood. Causing them to bark, not pay attention to your instructions and even bite you.  Often, I observed, he does not listen to me and plays obstinate. But he fears me if I intimidate him.    So is there any reality behind my brother's claim and that's why he is acting strange sometimes? Or I have been affected by his advice deeply? Is there a connection between this behaviour and whether or not our dog mates with other dogs? "
187,How to get cats to coexist in peace?,"My cat is a big neutered male and my sister's cat is a small female. Both cats are three years old. When my sister is away on holidays I have to take care of both cats. Unfortunately, they hiss at each other, are never relaxed, sometimes my cat attacks the smaller one, and though there's no serious damage done (after some meowing he stops), I'm afraid to leave them alone.   This is going on for days and I don't see any considerable progress.  How can I get the two cats to coexist in peace?   Will they eventually learn to tolerate each other, or some cats are just ""incompatible""?  I will be minding my sister's cat for about one more week, then they likely won't meet for another year. "
188,Why is my dog eating dirt?,"I'm finding dirt in my dachshund's poop.  He eats his regular kibble and sometimes doesn't finish it all, and he does get snacks and a vitamin pill.  I'm finding areas in the yard that have been slightly pawed at and the black dirt (sand, tiny pebbles, loam, soil, dirt) I find in his poo matches the dirt from the digging areas.  I'm concerned he may pick up a parasite from this habit.  He'll stop when I catch him in the act, but he can't be constantly monitored.   He isn't kept as an outdoor dog.    Why is he eating the dirt?  How do I stop him from eating the dirt?  What else should I be concerned about with this situation? "
189,How can I train my cat to not jump on the kitchen counters?,"My cat jumps onto our kitchen counters frequently, sometimes causing major accidents. What is the best way to break that habit? Would I need one of those electric shocker things? "

191,What is the ideal frequency and time to feed my 11-year-old bichon frisé?,I have an 11-year-old Bichon Frisé. She is in good shape (8.9kg) and eats mostly ration. Exceptions include occasional tiny pieces of carrot (she loves it!) and some dog chews (only whites) 3-4 times a week.  The recommended daily amount of dog food I should give her is printed on the package of the dog food I buy.     Should this amount be given at once?   How many times daily should I split this quantity to maximize health benefits?  What are the best times of the day to feed her?  
192,Why do neutered dogs still show sexual signs?,"My dogs are both neutered - however they both still hump people, objects, and even each other. Sometimes they even get aroused.  Is this a sign of dominance? Or is it a sexual thing? "
193,Why do dogs eat grass?,"I have always been told that dogs eat grass because they have upset stomachs. My dogs, however, eat grass every single time they go outside. I constantly need to remind them that grass is not for eating.   Are they just hungry? Do they always have an upset stomach? Or do they have some nutritional deficiency? "
194,How do I know when I need to replace the charcoal in my aquarium filter?,"I recently purchased and installed an External Canister Filter in my aquarium which includes a filter stage with little bags of charcoal media.  Clearly I need to replace this at some interval because the manual tells you how to replace it and I see them selling it at the store, but the manual says nothing about the frequency or determining when the charcoal media needs to be replaced. I'm assuming I don't wait until it is gone, but does it change color or something to indicate it is used up? Will my tank start getting more algae when it stops working? Can I tell by smelling it? Or do you just have to do it at a specific time interval? If so, how do I know what that time interval should be. "
195,How would I deal with a choking cat?,Can someone describe the technique for dealing with a cat that is choking? I just want to know in case my cat ever gets something stuck in its throat. Is it similar to CPR? 
196,Rectifying behavioral issues stemmed from hitting my dog as punishment,"Okay, now I know opinions are largely divided on whether negative or positive reinforcement is the best way to discipline a dog, that's not my question.  From since she was a puppy (she's a 10 month old Bichon Frise), I've always hit her nose to discipline her, which seemed to work effectively. However, she's now exhibiting some behavioral issues that I want to try and get rid of before it's two late.  I've decided I need a better approach at discipline, namely positive reinforcement. In the case of her doing something wrong, I'll simply ignore her or put her in the kitchen for a short period (15 minutes). If she's good, she'll get loads of praise/treats (I already do this after walks/after crying to go out at the door, then going out to do her business).  Basically, there's a few things she now does. Some are probably not directly related to the negative reinforcement, but I'm unsure as to which are a direct result.   She is scared of strangers - Whilst out walking, if a stranger reaches out a hand to stroke her, her initial reaction is to run a mile or growl (I've read that this is a side effect of negative reinforcement). She will sniff and try and follow strangers though, strangely. She is scared of other dogs - Now, if another dog comes up to here, initially she will run a mile. If another dog doesn't acknowledge her, she'll either growl or run to see them. All she does is be aggressive towards my mother's Bichon - Well it's more like aggresive play, she'll basically bite at the other dog's joules constantly and wherever the other dog goes, she has to go first and get in front of (something like little dog syndrome). She barks all day at anything that makes a sound/goes past the window - I think nothing can be done about this, it's more a territorial thing. Weirdly though, she's about 10x worse than my Mother's Bichon (who's 4 year old).   I have two questions really:  1) Is it too late in my dog's learning cycle to rectify the behavioral issues?  2) How can I rectify these issues and what discipline strategy should I now employ? "
197,What should I do if my cat vomits his food?,"Recently, my 1 year-old cat vomited over my kitchen floor while playing. I was worried and unsure what to do, so I just cleaned him up and made sure he was OK.   What should I do if he vomits again?   Should I take him to a pet hospital?   Why is he even vomiting?  We change his brand of food often; is that related? "
198,Why do rabbits chew electrical wires?,"Bunnies like to chew on electrical wires.

199,Will a couple of guppy males be happy in my fish tank?,Will a couple of guppy males be happy in a community tank without guppy females?

200,Why does my cat act hostile towards my other cat after being kenneled for a week?,"I have three cats, a male red tabby (Ed) and two black cats, father (Boo) and daughter. All three cats have lived together for the majority of their lives (13-ish years). They get along fine, aside from the normal morning batting at the food bowl between the males. They've been around each other and coexist quite well.   I just got back from a week-long vacation. We had to kennel all three of our cats at the vet. There were no issues reported.   Upon releasing all three cats back at our house, my red-tabby - Ed - started hissing at the black male - Boo. He then ran away and promptly tried to spray on a box. Both Ed and Boo have sprayed before, but it's a habit we have broken. Ed went on to attempt to spray on several other surfaces.   When separate from Boo, Ed acts perfectly normal. He tries to sniff everything - totally expected - but other than that he is responsive to me and purrs just fine. When he sees a black cat though - Boo or his daughter - he tries to get away and spray on something. If he's cornered he'll growl or hiss at them as he rushes by.   Why is this, and what can I do about it?   Keeping the cats separate is a temporary option, but it doesn't work too well overnight, as the cats will invariably want to roam around the rest of the house at night, and complain loudly if they can't. Not very conducive to sleeping. Is there perhaps a way I can convince Ed that he doesn't need to defend his territory from Boo (I assume that's what's going on)?   Interestingly, neither Boo nor his daughter have the same behavior. They are simply sniffing everything and slowly returning to normal. They exhibit no other strange behavior, and act fine around Ed.   EDIT: As of the morning after, Ed is now meowing incessantly. All night long he meowed non-stop, waited 10-20 minutes, started up again, stopped again - all night. He started doing this soon after we brought him back and he got his bearings.   The meowing has lessened somewhat this morning, though he is still doing it frequently. He is sniffing Boo's daughter and seems fine with her. Boo has been separated all night.  "
201,"My aggressive fish has become very shy, afraid in the last week. What changed?","I have a 225 gallon aquarium. I have 10 large fish inside. The most aggressive fish is my Red Devil. He normally chases all other fish and the others will rarely if ever attempt to go after him. This has changed in the last week. He is now very shy, stays in the upper corner of the tank or hides behind the rocks. He is also eating very little. Nothing has changed in the environment. I have had the same 10 fish in the tank with nothing added and no deaths for the last 9 months. The setup itself is about 4 years running now.  I did notice a small gash between his eyes. I am not sure if what is inside the gash is an infection or just the way the tissue is healing. It does not look like it's full of pus or anything. But it's like white/green in color. Could anyone shed any light on why this fish has had such a major change in behavior? What can be done to get him back to his regular self? "
202,"Is 10 months late to teach a cat to self-feeding? If not, how shall I proceed?","OK some background first...  We got the cat from the streets when he was approximately 1 month old. He was in an animal shelter until he was 2 months then came to our house, December 2016.   The first months, lets say 2, we would fill his bowl and he decided when to eat, a full bowl usually lasted the whole day, even until the next morning some days. When he was about 4-5 months, we started to giving him 3 meals per day, since he seemed bit anxious about eating (this whole time, he was eating kitten food, good quality, always dry).  With 5-6 months we had him neutered, and started eating special food, again, good quality, dry, still with 3 meals per day, but he started meaw-ing a lot, asking for food between hours, can't really tell if he is always that hungry, or just bored and likes to eat, anyway, we never give him more than he should eat. This has been the norm until september.  For the last month approximately, he have been trying to teach him to self feed, giving him all his 3 meals together in the morning (7am, maybe 9-10 the weekends), but he always eats everything before 12am. Then for the rest of the day, he keeps asking for more, yet again, can't tell if he is hungry or just likes food. He eats all of his food really fast, and he is starting to be a little overweighted, >5kg now, 5.5 aprox.   Always high quality dry food, same brand. (Wild Instinct). We want to teach him to self-feed himself, since it is more convenient for us, if we spend a day out for example, and I think it is better for him also (if he really learns it), but he seems a bit anxious. Also, he always tries to steal our food while we are eating or when something is left on the table (specially, bread, he loves it).  He is the only animal in the house, spends lots of time alone (>6h per day)  Am I doing it right? Is self-feeding a good/viable option? I am new to cats, this is my first one.   EDIT: It is this type of cat: [website]EDIT2: He eats 75gr of dry food per day. "
203,does my cat have an infection?,"Our neighbor's cat visited. It stayed for about three weeks(still here), and it has black stuff coming out of it's nose, and on the sides of it's eyes. It started with only it's eyes, so we thought it was only eye bugers, sense it's a purely white cat and we've seen that alot in white cats, and sense the neighbors didn't do anything about it. I'm not taking it to the vet yet,because it still doesn't seem like something big now that it's been for three weeks and the cat is acting normal. I may take it though if I discover it needs it. I'm thinking it may have something to do with the lack of sunlight maybe. The picture will be shown below in case I'm not clear enough.   Now the problem here is; 1- We cleaned around it's eyes with cutips, but it keeps coming back.  2- After around 3 weeks MY cat started getting it at the sides of it's nose. Which is really getting me concerned.  But if it was some kind of sickness and contagious why did my cat only catch it after 3 weeks? Can it somehow be contagious to people? What can it cause to the two cats? If I clean their noses (and eyes) with anti bacterial soap (really carefuly)will it still come back? I'd most defeniately appreciate the help,provided details of coarse.   The vet has been costing us alot for some time and it's getting on our nerves. If there are any home remedies to solve the problem I'd be working on the cats 24/7, I don't mind. I just hope to get the this done without having to pay much although if it's necessary I may have to. I have no Idea what this is and I'm starting to get worried.   For more information, the first cat to have it had it only on it's eyes, (and I'm starting to think it was only on one at first but not really sure) but then got it on the sides of it's nose as well. My sister told me it had a somewhat a fever (she isn't a veterinarian or the sort) every now and then, but she doesn't feel it any more. The two have diarrhea but not major. They are happy and acting normal, playing together like nothings there. And finally the MOST important fact, I suspect my cat is pregnant, she started having this for two days now. Can this affect her?   "
204,How to make neighborhood kitten understand it doesn't live with us,"Short version: A neighborhood kitten has decided it likes our place. How do we teach it that it doesn’t live here?  Longer version: We have two cats. Neutered females from the same litter, about 3 years old. They are indoor/outdoor cats, but we do not have a cat door – we let them in and out on their request and often a door is just left open. They are fed wet food – again, when they request it – and have dry food available for nights and when we are not home.  Another family on our street used to have three cats, but over the last few years, two of them died. They have now gotten two kittens to replace them. That is, they have two new kittens and one older cat. Their cats are also indoor/outdoor cats, but they have a cat door. Their cats have food available at all times.  One day, one of the kittens (female – don’t know if she is neutered) showed up at our place. Not knowing where it belonged, my husband gave it a bit of food (probably a mistake) to make it keep still while he took a picture for our local facebook page to find out if anybody missed it. The owners responded that it was theirs, but several other people replied that it had also visited them. Turns out this kitten likes to wander – and quite far, too!  She has since made visits to us very regularly, often several times a day. If doors are open, she will enter and go straight to our cats’ food (she will eat remaining wet food first and then the dry food after, if we don’t stop her). Even if there is no food, she will seek us out as she is very social. She will jump up and lie next to us on the couch or on the desk, if we are working.  If all humans involved where adults, this would not be a problem – she could go back and forth, as she pleased. However, the kids in the owner family obviously want their kitten to be at their house, not at ours, so we agreed that we would try to prevent her from getting in to our house and keep her out of our cat food. Surely, she would then go home!? Not so much… she would meow outside the windows for a while and when that didn’t work just lie there. Outside the windows. In the rain. For hours… So next we agreed that I would text the family whenever the kitten showed up and they would come get her. That is what we are doing now, but the kitten still shows up. She is super happy when her people come for her, but still goes to our house instead of going home on her own. The owners try to keep her in for a while to teach her where she belongs, but they cannot completely close of the cat door because of the older cat.  As stated, she has food available at home, and she knows how the cat door works.  Our own cats are not too fond of the kitten: they hiss and meow at her angrily, but they do not swat at her or bite her. If she gets within a couple of feet of them, they will simply walk away.  The owners have suggested a next step would be for us to spray water at her. We have done this with our own cats to keep them from scratching the furniture, but I feel a bit bad about doing it to the kitten – I’m not sure it would understand why it is being sprayed water at.  Including the first time my husband fed her, she has probably eaten here 3-4 times (the other times by simply walking into the house when the door was open). The jumping onto the couch/desk was one day – the day we realized she felt so much at home that we had to talk with the owner family to find out what they wanted us to do. Trying to keep her out of the house and texting the owners has gone on for about a week.  Does anyone have suggestions to what else we can do to make her understand that she does not belong at our house?  Note: please do not make this about allowing cats outside. That will not be changed for any of the cats.  Update: Here, a few months later, this is how things have developed. For a while it seemed like ignoring the kitten helped (from facebook we gathered that she found other neighbours to visit), but then she started returning again. Her constant visits bagan stressing our own cats a great deal, so in the end we resorted to spraying her with water. This was actually pretty efficient, and soon she stopped coming by. We know from the owners that she has a bit less wanderlust now, but still doesn't hold back from entering the houses of other neighbours - but we haven't seen her at our house for well over a month now. "
205,Easiest Ancistrus to breed,"To follow up on a previous question of mine and some information provided in an answer there (Ancistrus breeding in rock pile)  What Ancistrus is the easiest to breed?  My reasoning around this would be that the cheaper they are, the easier they are to breed (hence the price). So the pet store price should be a pretty good indicator, no? "
206,My cat vomited and pooped in the house?,"My cat pooped on my bed last night and a few days ago my sister noticed he vomited on the floor. He's a little over a year and usually goes out in the garden to poop. We haven't changed the kind of food we give him, but up until now there was always someone home to give the cats food.   Now with school starting they get food at around 6 am and then again not until 3 pm; could it just be him reacting badly to the sudden change in the feeding schedule? Or that he ate too much too quickly? Could it point to something more serious? Up until now he hasn't been sick and he's acting pretty much like usual, maybe only a bit strange. "
207,Why does every single dog seem to hate mine?,"I have a 7 year old female Pomeranian.  I take her out for a walk to a nearby park in the neighborhood every now and then. But in various occasions, when leaving home, she appears to be terrified even though there is literally no threat I can observe.  When this happens, I walk her out anyway (sometimes I have to lift her up) - and whenever she is afraid I know it's because there are dogs in the garages of the neighborhood houses. It's interesting because you have to walk quite a distance before you can see the dogs, so it's like she can smell them from far away or something.  Anyway, her fear doesn't seem to be irrational either: every single dog will bark and snarl at her from the garages. Small and big, male and female, they all seem to hate my pomeranian for some reason. And my dog knows!  What makes this especially weird is that I've seen people walking their dogs around the neighborhood and they don't get the same treatment.  It's not just garage dogs - dogs that are being walked at the same time also seem to dislike mine.  Funnily, I've found two stray dogs that are not aggressive against mine and surprisingly my dog is not afraid of them either (not even her sixth sense seems to kick in). It's really weird.  For this reason I have always avoided letting her interact with those dogs in fear that they'll attack her or something (they look angry and my dog is clearly afraid).    Why does this happen, and am I overreacting? Should I let my dog interact with them and see what happens? "
208,Is it possible to train a dog to use a litterbox?,"Normally this isn't an issue since dogs do their business while going on walks. Recently however, my dog seem to need to do her business more often than I take her on walks.   My normal schedule is to take her on a walk first thing in the morning before I head to work around 6:30-7am. Then I feed her and leave for work. Then I walk her again when I get home from work around 5:30pm and then feed her afterward again.   Recently my dog has been whining and waking me up around midnight to take her out. The closest grassy area that she normally does her business is about 2 blocks away and its quite bothersome to get waken up in the middle of the night to walk two blocks away and back.  Have there been cases in the past where people have trained dogs to use a litterbox like cats? Is there any sort of detrimental effects from encouraging such behavior? "
209,Need help with behaviour of new cat,"I am having an hard with my nan's cat: she passed away a couple of weeks ago, so I am taking care of her.  Problem is, I think she is quite nervous around people: whenever I enter the courtyard she always is in this place or climbing the ladder:    She won't come down unless you bring her food, and sometimes not even then. From the roof, she stares down at me and meows incessantly: she litteraly won't stop!  If I blink slowly at her she won't blink back, but would sometimes look away instead.  My dad tried to pet her while she was in the courtyard, and got scratched.  Oddly enough she came downstairs by her own and stared, meowed at me as usual, sometimes lowering her ears. This time I managed to record it, maybe someone can help me figure out what kind of meowing it is?  [website]I thought she maybe was very hungry but left half of the food behind.  Then she sat in the middle of the courtyard, with the tip of her tail raised and still. (Can not post pics due to rep req.)  Whenever I go visit her I also sit down for a few minutes so that I can appear less intimidating.  I never owned a cat before, can someone help me figure out what should I do?  Thanks. "
210,How can I stop my cats from urinating in the pet carrier?,"We have two British Shorthairs, George and Martha, 4 years old. Last year, George peed himself in the pet carrier on the way to the vet. Looking back, part of the problem probably was timing, as I had the appointment about 2.5 hours after the cats had breakfast, and he usually pees about 3-3.5 hours after meals. I cleaned the carrier, albeit only with water and normal detergent, threw out the old blanket and put in a new one.   Last week I had another appointment for their annual checkup, which I specifically made in the afternoon, but unfortunately, this time both cats peed in their (separate) pet carriers. Also, I think one of the cats (pretty sure it was George) once peed in the carrier when we brought them to my parents-in-law, but I think that was only once out of the 2-4 trips they made to their house.   So this time I cleaned the pet carriers thoroughly with UrineOff and put in a pee pad, just in case (we use normal cat litter in their litter boxes). I also arranged that they'll be fed dinner at my parents-in-law's, so I expected their bladders to be fairly empty. But the very first thing Martha did when I put her into the carrier is pee!   I've read through most of the other questions relating to urinating in inappropiate places, but I feel that most of the suggestions don't apply - I can't shoo them away when I see that they want to pee, travelling is always associated with stress, they're not trained to pee on these pads, or blankets in general, and apart from the pet carriers, they never do; it's highly unlikely that this is related to a health problem, it's quite likely that it's related to George's very first accident a year ago.   Unfortunately I never marked the pet carriers, so it's possible that at some point we put the Martha into the one that was peed into by George. I do know that I used the same pet carrier for Martha last week and tonight, and I'm quite sure it was the one that hadn't been peed into, because we also used it as a crate and Martha actually used it quite regularly as a bed - so that's why I'm really confused why she peed, and why she peed into that carrier.  So I guess my questions are:   What can I do to stop them from peeing into the pet carriers? Do I need to get them new carriers, and will they stop peeing if I do? What else can I do to minimize the risk that they'll pee in a carrier? If I get them new carriers, is it a good idea to use pee pads again, or will they associate that with urinating?   Update  I'm pretty sure now that the accidents were indeed fear-related, as several answers suggested. When my husband picked them up again from his parents' place this past weekend, they came home without any accident (surprise, surprise). I think putting them on the toilet in advance is a good idea (though I'll have to find out first which toilet is used by which cat). The cats are actually used to the carriers; as mentioned above, Martha sleeps in one of them quite regularly, so I was very surprised that she, too, peed into it.   I'm also wondering if it might help to organize things differently. I usually bring them to the vet, and my husband usually brings them to his parents' place whenever we're going on a vacation but I'll help him pack their things and put the cats in the carriers. Perhaps we should see what happens if he does that on his own. "
211,"Pet rats companion died and was canibalized, is now alone","About 4 months ago I bought two young-ish female rats, Star and Blaze. The store said they were the same litter but their coloring and size as they grew leads me to believe that may not have been the case..   Blaze has always wanted to crawl rather than just be held but licks people and I reward her with unsalted sunflower seeds (her favorite) and has never used her teeth on anyone. Star however, while most of her time with me has been sweet despite the lack of kisses has always been very cuddly but bit someone's ear while they were cuddling her against their neck earlier this month. I was shocked because it wasn't an aggressive ""I'm scared bite"" but rather just put her teeth on him and slowly clamped down and wouldn't let go until I pried her mouth open at the jaw. Moments before the incident she was making a chickering noise often associate with happiness and comfort at her surroundings.   Blaze and Star have lived in harmony for the past 4 months for the most part, other than wrestling that doesn't seem to be violent other than a few squeaks. I never even seen missing fur on her like I've seen on one rat that was a bit ""bullied,"" when I had five rats at once several years ago.   At 7am this morning all seemed fine, both just waking up and seemingly energetic and healthy.. but when I came back from work at 5:30pm, Star was dead and Blaze was eating her! I know disposing of a body by eating them is completely normal for rats and other small mammals as it's the only way they know how to get rid of the body, regardless of how traumatizing for me it was to witness.  One of my concerns is that many times their wrestling was not long after I fed them (a bowl full every other day) and Blaze was definitely bigger in general either because of them being a different litter like I suspect or her dominance over the cage and the food.. I'm worried that Blaze may have killed her either over a food scuffle, by accident or if Star passed for some unrelated reason. With knowing now that she can eat her cage sister, while I don't want her to be lonely, I'm concerned of her taking to a new companion AND that new Rat's safety.   It's hard for me to look at/handle Blaze now knowing that the insides of her sister are currently in her belly despite how affectionate she's been to me and others in the past... And while I want to leave her be to process the death and for me to get over what I saw, I know rats don't do well alone, especially if they have never been alone before. I don't want to harm Blaze's psyche by leaving her alone in her cage, but I'm scared to witness what I saw earlier again if I get her a new mate.   Does anyone have any advice on:   How Star may have died suddenly after having no apparent health issues hours earlier? Is the wrestling I saw normal, or should I have been concerned at the difference in size and the squeaking? If I should get Blaze a new companion, and how long should I wait if I wait at all?   I'd really appreciate any help I can get with this because despite what happened and how hesitant I am with her right now, I love Blaze and I want to do what's right for her as well as myself.. Thanks in advance!! "
212,Old&New urine smell &Stains,"I have 3 dogs(with behavioral issues) who will not stop peeing on the carpet. I have tried vinegar and baking soda, it just seemed to make it worse or not at all.

213,Is it acceptable to tie a dog to a leash as a timeout to prevent biting?,"My 2 month old puppy is teething and has a natural proclivity for biting things; anything and everything. While I understand that this behavior is natural and might stop after a while, he also bites people and that's becoming a problem as he grows older.  I've tried saying a firm, ""No"" and ignoring him for about 10-20 minutes after he starts biting, but he'll still jump and bark and try to bite the flesh. He'll follow me if I distance myself from him and then bite me, so there's really no ignoring him. It's particularly more concerning when he tries to bite people that are sleeping.  I looked through the comments and answers posted here and here and I like the idea of temporarily confining my puppy (e.g. using baby gates) but I don't have those so I resort to putting a leash on him and tying him to a newel post.  That results in him calming down after a while but not before he barks incessantly and tries to break free of the leash. After a few minutes, he'll whine and guilt-trip me into cutting him loose, which I do. However, the biting behavior will still continue albeit after a little while.  So my question is this: ""Is it okay if I tie him to a post temporarily if I am unable to effectively distance myself from him while he's biting? If not, what's a better alternative?"" "
214,Can we feed our cat with the mix of home-cooked and specialized food?,"We have a Siberian cat 6 months old, and currently we feed him as follows:   dry food: Royal Canin for Kittens home-cooked food: soup with beef (or turkey or chicken) and some veggies (no salt/anything else but meat, veggies and water) if we don't have time to cook, we use Gourmet wed food   So we feed him dry food a couple of times a day, and wet food (either home-cooked or Gourmet) a couple of times a day. W.r.t. the home-made food he very much likes the soup itself, and eats the meat/veggies usually after finished with the liquid part - so we try to feed him with the home-cooked option, in addition to the dry food. At the same time, I have read that one shall not mix home-cooked and specialized food for cats, since different ferments are required for the two, and disbalancing them by the mix feed can cause distant issues when cat is older. Not stones, but more about their digestion becomes poorer and they don't get enough from the food due to issues with fermentation.   Of course for us it is easier to just feed him with a bought food, so my question is mainly: is there any disadvantage of excluding the home-made food from the ration of our cat? We are going to try Orijen now as the dry option, and apparently it is good on nutrition quality, so with Gourmet wet food in addition, nutrition shall be covered well. Yet, maybe there is some good thing from the home-made soups, which he likes so much? I'm hesitant to consult the vet, since I live in Netherlands and after seeing cats around I am not sure whether vets dietary advice are good here.  One more thing: I've read that since many cats are bred from the species that lived in low-moisture regions (deserts) their sources of hydration are mostly from food. At the same time, afaik Siberian cats are bred from Russian wild cats that lived in forests/river areas, so perhaps that may cause some differences in how they should be fed, compared to other breeds.

217,How stressing is it for fish when someone taps/slaps their glass?,"Everything I've read says you shouldn't tap an aquarium because it startles the fish, and that's bad for their mental health.  I've been satisfied by that argument.  As of late, my toddler has started tapping and even slapping the glass of one of our tanks.  Obviously I am intervening to stop this, but now I have a funny balance to strike: how strict should I be with my toddler?  Obviously only I can answer that one, because it's my child, but I realized I'm lacking in some information.  How much are fish actually impacted by this sort of acoustic stress?  Is this the kind of thing you worry about in a doctor's office where kids might bang on a tank all day long, 5 days a week?  Or is it something where problems arise more rapidly with occasional tapping? "
218,Old pup lunges at new dog,"we are fostering a dog with the intention of adoption. We have had our first dog for a year and a few months. She is somewhat dog reactive but has gotten along with my parents dogs.   Our new pup is very calm.

220,Fish's fin got torn in garbage disposal,"Putter my fish is two years old. Yesterday while cleaning out his bowl, he jumped out and landed in the sink and fell down the disposal hole with freshly cut potato skins. I managed to get him out within 40 seconds and got him in his holding tank.  I did not want to stress him any further so I left him there overnight.  He has some fin damage and a small scrape on his body which is very shallow. He has been swimming since and this morning he also ate.   Shall I leave him alone and transfer him back to his regular bowl? Shall I be pro-active and treat him for fin rot in case it happens because his fin is damaged? "

226,Help! Adopted stray cat peeing on my bed all of a sudden,"My female spayed cat Togepi was a stray cat until earlier this year (round about march) when we decided to take her in. As a stray cat she spent most of her time outside and refused to use a litter box since she's used to going in gardens and dirt all her life.   Recently she's become more needy and loving after her sterilization, and I decided to start keeping her inside, with open doors so she could go outside when nature calls. It's never been a problem before, but all of a sudden she started to pee on my bed. This morning for e.g. I took her outside to pee and she didn't, came back to my room, and played for about 20 min, after which she jumped on top of my bed looked me straight in the eye and started peeing.  Now I don't know what to make of this, since last week she was at a vet for a full examination, micro chipping, vaccines etc. In other words - health wise she's as healthy as can get. But she has never used a litter box before and now all of a sudden she keeps peeing on my bed.   Note: She did it again later after I washed all my sheets too.  I have narrowed it down to either stress, or marking territory since shes only recently been allowed to wander about in the house and sleep inside.  Also, I will be moving overseas soon and my family is moving to another house soon too- can this underline stress be the culprit of this strange behavior?  For the check list: *I play with her everyday for almost an hour if not more, day and night *I feed her everyday *She sleeps mostly in my room *She follows me around like my shadow  *I give her plenty of love and affection *We have a litter box, but she doesn't use it, and I cleaned it as well, she still peed on my bed.  any suggestions that may help?

If milk caused problems or discomfort for a cat in the past, the cat would know it and would NOT keep drinking milk, right?  -- especially an outdoor cat, or a half-feral cat, right?  My favorite half-feral  cat seems very careful about trying new food.  It tries a nibble, goes away, and comes back a few hours later --  presumably after it has determined that the new food item is ok.    Can I ask a related question?    I've seen on TV shows : hardcore ""survival skills"" guys saying what they do to see if a wild fruit is safe to eat -- they first rub it against the skin (wait a few hours), eat a tiny portion (wait several hours), eat a nibble (wait several hours), then it's safe to eat. -- or something like that.  -- Do  feral cats do this ?

All of his sisters died so we got him a friend. They play a lot then they get sleepy. My question is: When he gets sleepy, why does he suck on a blanket we have?  Is it because he didn't have a mom when we found him? He was about 1 month old, possibly less, so I thought maybe he sucked on the blanket because he never had his mom, but I just want to know why he does it. "
232,Help Training My Cat?,"I have 4 different problems with my cat.  1) He doesn't meow when he is hungry, but he gets really lovable and as soon as you get up to move he MEOWS to the point it's really annoying and he won't stop tell he starts to eat. Is there a good way to stop this meowing?  2) He won't wait tell I pour the food all the way out to eat. He starts to eat it as I am pouring it out and even shoves his face into the bag while I'm pouring it. Is there a way to train him to not do this?  3) I have a litter box, but I live in a one bedroom apartment and it stinks like crazy! I would love to be able to teach him to be able to tell me he needs to go outside and put it out on the balcony so it won't smell the whole entire apartment up.  Before I do this last one I have to say this. He is/was a stray. I dont know hiw old he is. He didn't take long to trust me, but he was a stray so he has his aggressive times, but the problem is the longer I have him the worse and meaner he gets.  4) He will be purring and lovable then all the sudden he will attack my hand and hiss. I can't touch him ""wrong"" or he gets mad and attacks me, then goes straight back to being lovable Intel I touch him in a way he doesn't like. There have been times that I just had my hand laying by him and he got mad and started attacking it. This is what has been making me want to get rid of him, but I would love to keep him around so I'm not lonely when my partners at work and I don't want to have to throw him out because then I will feel bad. Is there a way to teach him not to attack? "

234,My cat is very affectionate and hungry,"My 8 year old adopted cat is great. He's super intelligent but a bit lazy... I've bought every toy and tried to entertain him, but nothing---- only when it comes to food. The thing is, he is so needy- only for food! He begs incessantly for food, then once he is fed he will rush up to me and make himself comfortable and practically burp in my face! I got him at 4 years old, and all this time I've kept him on a reasonable diet.  He is super affectionate, loving and great- except for his begging for food.  I was worried it was worms, but it isn't. I make sure he is entertained in between feedings, but is he still bored? Anyone have some advice?  "

236,How can I train my dog to ring a bell to go outside?,"I've been trying to train my 9-year old dog to ring a bell on the door when she needs/wants to go outside.  I've been trying for about a year now with very minimal success.  I use obedience snacks to try to train her to ring the bell.  When she needs to go out, we go to the door, and I have her give me her paw, which I then gently use to swat the bell.  Then I give her one snack and open the door to let her out.  I've tried giving the snack at different times:  before ringing the bell, after ringing the bell but before opening the door, after opening the door, and even after she physically goes outside.  When she needs to go out, she walks to the door, but doesn't have the concept of the ringing it by herself.  When I get over there, she gets in position and starts to put her paw in the air for me to grab, but she hasn't learned to ring by herself.  What am I doing wrong?  What do I need to do to make the association in her brain?  Or is she simply too old to learn at this point and I should just give up? "
237,How can I get my cat to stop chasing my other cat?,"I have three cats. All neutered and spayed. A tuxedo named Pip, a tabby named Kitty, and a tortie named Faith. Pip isn't really all that important in this question, I'll give more info about him later. Faith is a grumpy cat and she is pretty aggressive, but it's more out of fear. She didn't trust me for most of my life but now she won't stop kneading my face in bed and keeping me up all night because she wants me to pet her. She's about 7-9 years, we aren't really sure. Now enter Kitty. He's a lil devil. We got him in about September or August of 2015, he's, I think, 3 years. We thought he was a kitten when we first found him because he was so small and skinny. Now he's small and fat. He's very territorial, constantly rub-rub-rubbing on every little thing to get his scent there and claim it. Pip, our sweet lil innocent angel that wouldn't hurt a fly. Well, he would, but he's a cat, what do you expect? He used to be more aggressive until my brother traumatized him (more on that in another question) and now he's very skittish.  This all sounds nice, you have 3 happy cats what could possibly go wrong?  ..A lot. Kitty's favorite activity is chasing Faith and battling with her. He's gotten into quite a few 'duels' with Pip (all of which Pip won) and so i think he's trying to show his dominance. He failed with Pip but Faith is weak and old so she's the perfect target for our little bully. I've not been sure on if i should ask this or not but the final straw was when i heard yowling and hissing from outside today. (Note: whenever Faith comes in Kitty tries to chase her so we have to hold him down so he won't chase her.) and Kitty was chasing Faith up the stairs to our deck and Faith was backed into a corner. I opened the door, shook kitty a few times and flicked him on the nose as punishment.  Things get worse when Faith fuels the fire. Whenever she sees Kitty she hisses and tries to scratch at him. Things get even worse when Pip joins in though. Pip doesn't know what he's doing, he chases her very rarely and i think he only does it because Kitty does it. (Kitty is then ultimate bad role model.)  I'm sure one of you will suggest to have them 'make friends' or something but that definitely wouldn't work. They'd murder eachother and if they didn't Faith would collapse under the stress.  Maybe one of you will suggest ""Maybe give one of them up."" However, I could not give up any of my kitties even if i wanted to. Faith, although she'd be freed from the stress of Pip and Kitty will be seperated from me. She gets very attached very easily and it would definitely not be a good idea. My sister (her original owner) left her in september to go to college and got attached to me, somebody she already had a slight bond with. IN a new house, she wouldn't recognize anyone and I think it would be even worse then the stress with Pip and Kitty she is facing now.  Suggestions, please? I am so tired. I've tried everything, clapping, flicking Kitty/Faith (when she starts the fight) on the forehead/nose, nothing works. "
238,My brother traumatized my cat. Help?,"My cat, Pip. We got him in september of 2014. He was lively, playful, brave, and hyper. My brother is a very mean guy. He sees amusement in other's pain and fear, and enjoys teasing me until i break down and cry for his own sick amusement. He does love the cats, but I think he broke one of our cats, Pip. As you can see, he used to be so happy and lively. How did he change?  Somewhere in 2015, my brother thought it would be funny to 'spook' Pip. Randomly jumping out at him, making loud noises, sneaking up on him, just being mean to him and doing everything he can to scare the cat. Quickly, Pip became very skittish, fearful, timid, and overall not at all what he used to be. He's still hyper, but uses it on the wrong things, such as running and jumping at the smallest of sounds, and begging for treats. He's not the same. It's been about a year and he's still this way.  I don't know if we can ever get the old Pip back, or if my brother scared him so bad he's forever broken. Either way, i really want help with this because Pip used to be so fun and happy. Now he's probably afraid of his own shadow.  Help, please? "
239,Separating older dogs from puppy when in living room,"I have 3 dogs. Two older dogs and one young puppy (1 yr old). Occasional the puppy doesn't hit the ""off"" switch with wanting to play and you can visible see the other dogs are starting to get annoyed.   As the puppy did not want to stop playing, I deciding to send him in the other area of the house (behind baby gate where he could still see everyone). That area is the ""dog"" area and has dog beds and toys.  My other 2 dogs laid on the ground in the same room as me.  Is this type of separation bad and will the puppy be resentful or feel ""less"" than the other dogs? Is there a better way of handling the situation?  Thank you. "
240,What Are The Benefits To Cropping Dog Ears?,"Some pet owners crop their dog's ears.  This procedure ends with the ears standing straight up.  I get the impression that this is genearlly tailored towards specific breeds (stronger ones), though I don't truly know.  There are various laws prohibiting these procedures in certain locations (even entire countries) because of animal cruelty.  Here's a before and after photo of what I'm referring to:      I can't help but wonder if there are any upsides to it at all.  Either medically, sensory, or functionally.  As far as I can tell, it looks like some owners do this strictly for appearences.  Upon further research, they apparently have a lot of different styles, too.  Like so:       Does this provide any legitimate benefit?   Why do people do it?  "
241,How can I stop my turtle from eating my pet goldfish?,"I had two turtles (male and female) and five golden fish in one 2.5x1.5 aquarium, which was filled with water up to 1 ft height. I fed all of them once a day, everyday in morning with protein Toya food (fishes also like it). But one evening one of my turtles ate one of the goldfish and left its corpse behind (few months ago even corpse wasn't found in water, when fish was small).  Why are they attacking the fish when I am feeding them daily? How can I stop it? I dont have a place to fit another aquarium for either the turtle or for the fish. Should I bring another bigger species like a frog or bigger fish that can guard the goldfish? The turtle who ate the fish also attacks the other turtle on its feet and neck. "
242,What is the difference between a tortoise and a turtle?,"I've noticed that both are quite often called the other (turtles being called tortoises and tortoises being called turtles). Just in case there is some confusion, could someone clarify what makes a tortoise a tortoise, and what makes a turtle a turtle? What makes them different? "
243,Should I keep my cat from playing in her litter box?,"I have a stray (cat) I took in a few days ago; a ~2 month old female with a clean bill of health and no unusual behavior.   She immediately used the litter box correctly and has not had any accidents (yet), but I am trying to reinforce her litter habits anyways. I've been giving her a lot of praise when she's in the box, and sometimes a treat when she's done.  But now sometimes when I'm near the litter box, she'll jump in it and roll around or hang out.  So I have two little questions, actually:   Do I even need to be doing this? She already seems to have the box down pretty well. If so, what action should I take when she goes in the box but then seems to be in there for non-bathroom reasons? Should I just do nothing in general then wait until she's finished before praising? Or does it not matter at all (should I even care about this)? I don't really want to take her out of the box, especially if she's actually going to end up using it.   I want to make sure she's well-trained so I can begin the process of letting her out of the room unattended, but I also don't want to encourage her to play in the litter box and make a mess.  It's been a while since I had a kitten. My other cat is very well-behaved, but I can't remember how he was trained; it was about 14 years ago. "
244,How can I stop my cat from dragging things into her litter box and food?,"We've had Tiny for four years. She is a pretty typical cat, except possibly for her pouch that swings from her belly when she walks. Pretty sure that's not related to this problem.  Ever since we got her, she has insisted on dragging whatever she can find to her food and litter box. Whether it's a sock, a plastic bag, sometimes as big as a shirt. She will go all around the house to do this too. I have found shirts that were two or three rooms away and up on a cat food bowl.  We try to keep the house clean, but we have two young daughters who tend to give Tiny plenty of targets for this. (And yes, we're sure it's Tiny. Diesel is 10, and none of this behavior occured before we got Tiny, and the behavior predates the children.)  When it's in the food, it isn't so bad. Just toss it in the laundry. But when she drags it to the litter box, it's kind of gross. I have to wear those socks and shirts. Her litter box is relatively close to the laundry room (there's really no other good place for it, and it's pretty out of the way) and when combined with the kids, there's no way to reliably cut off her supply of targets to drag.  So, what can I do to stop her? Is this caused by something I can control? Or do I just have a weird cat and have to deal with it? "
245,Why aren't my turtles producing eggs?,"I have two turtles, one male and another female, (I've identified the female by her more sloping back). There are 4 golden fish too in the tank with them.  It's been around 5 years since I brought them home, they were 3 inches in length from tail at that time and didn't have full grown nails (which were dirty white in color). Now their nails are fully grown and black, and they are both about 6 inches in length.  I was wondering that why there are no eggs yet? Did I wash them out during a water change when I was replacing the dirty water with new water? Could the water cleaner pump have sucked them out, or could the fish have eaten them? Is it not the right time, or could they have an improper diet? Please let me know how can I help them to conceive? "
246,How to earn a rescue cat's love,"I adopted my cat from my sister. She initially got it for her kids but hates cats, so she would just lock it in the basement. The cat would escape every now and then, sometimes for up to a week.   I couldn't stand watching this any longer so I told her that I would take the cat. I took her to get fixed and to get her shots; everything she needed. I found out she has FIV, so I can't let her outside. She doesn't eat treats.   She has definitely warmed up but I'm way more used to lovey-dovey cats. She's two years old and I've had her for about a year. I just want to know how I can earn her love? Is this just something that takes time or is there anything I can do to help?  "
247,Can a neglected/abandoned domestic house rabbit be re-socialized?,"I know from the question Can an adult feral cat be socialized/domesticated? and the somewhat related question Why are cats released as part of “spay and release” programs? that socializing a cat that has gone feral can be challenging.  If a domestic rabbit is released and later recaptured, can it be re-socialized?    "
248,Is it safe to shave a Chow-Chow for the summer?,"We own a 6-month old Chow-Chow. We'd like to take him to a professional groomer now that summer is here. Are there any special precautions we should pay attention to? I've heard that some dogs have a two-layer coat and that it can be dangerous to shave both layers, is this true? "
249,How do I feed a turtle foods that don't float?,"I have a small turtle, and I feed it a variety of food including boiled chicken, slugs, earthworms, and vegetables. I've recently upgraded its aquarium and added substrate and made it deeper.   I'm not sure if the turtle will still find it easy to locate or eat its food, and there may be a risk of it swallowing some substrate in the process (I'm not sure I just fear that).   Is this a problem? If yes then do I have to feed it in a separate bowl or what?  Also, I think my turtle would be reluctant to eat in a separate bowl; I know many are. "
250,Travelling with cat by plane,"We are currently arranging for our pet cat to join us in the UK.  We've gone through the process of organising the trip and fulfilled (or will do) all the requirements to have the cat in the UK (she is travelling within the EU).  The problem is that I'm worried about the flight itself. She's doesn't like being transported in containers, though we've taken steps to accustom her to her container by leaving treats there and occasionally keeping her in it. We also get her to travel with us by car.   I'm particularly worried about psychological trauma as the poor thing will be kept in her container for no less than 5 hours (albeit the flight is direct, the transport company have asked us to bring her several hours prior to it).  Do you think it could be too much? There's a possibility she could stay with family. Shall we not risk it and go for that?  EDIT: We received the cat on Friday, 2014/08/22 in good health and I'm very happy to say that everything went smooth and she is adjusting fine to her new environment. Many thanks again for the helpful answers posted here. "
251,How long will it take for a turtle to get used to a new aquarium?,"I've set up an aquarium for my turtle, added the basics I know of.   I move my turtle like 4 times a day, 2 times to place it under direct sunlight since I'm yet to find UV-B and UV-A lights. And another two times to feed it in a separate bowl. Does this movement affect the turtle's mood and cause stress?   I also notice my turtle trying to climb out sometimes, mostly only when it sees me or when it is outside it's aquarium. But it does do so sometimes in the aquarium, is that a sign that it didn't settle yet?   I'd simply like to know when my turtle would start to consider this home or if it already has. Any advice on avoiding stuff that discontent the turtle and/or scare it, as well as advice about things the turtle might like is welcome.   Thank you for your time. "
252,What plants should I not have around cats?,"Kind of the opposite of this question: What are safe plants to let my cat chew on?  I have some cat grass and plants for my cats, but now that I'm in a larger house, I want to keep some indoor houseplants for myself. Are there plants that I should avoid getting due to them being poisonous to cats or something? "
253,Why are dogs afraid of fireworks and thunder?,"When my dog was younger she had no visible reaction to fireworks or thunder. At about 5 years old it started to be an issue, and now (at 7) she panics and hides under the table, shaking, when some little popping fireworks go off down the street.  My dog does not have this reaction to other things that sound similar to me; cars backfiring, garbage trucks dumping, construction crews using power tools, and neighborhood parties with loud subwoofers do not provoke her at all.  What is it about fireworks and thunder that make dogs react so strongly? Is this reaction common to every dog or more individual in nature? Are there factors such as breed, age, etc. that make dogs more or less sensitive? "
254,"Chameleon has swelling on hind legs, what could be the cause of this? Metabolic bone disease or something else?","I recently purchased a juvenile male veiled chameleon. He has small swellings on the back of his hind legs which I fear could be symptoms of metabolic bone disease.     Any help? I've seen a lot of chameleons which look just like this but otherwise exhibit zero symptoms of MBD. Also, if it is MBD, if I begin treating it now, is there any possibility that he could ""outgrow"" the symptoms when he gets older, or should I take him back to where I purchased him? "
255,Is it possible to create an air pump from leaf blower?,"Can I make an aquarium air pump from a leaf blower, to aerate all my aquariums at once ?   I am planning to cover the output of the blower with a pvc end-cap (holes drilled in) and run air line tubing to the aquariums from the holes. Will this be efficient or practical? "
256,Does dosing a tank for sicknesses cause harm if I can't diagnose the illness?,"I came home after work today to my baby guppy tank showing signs of sickness.  About 50% of them are gasping for air. I just did a 50% water change, after using my master kit, and seeing that my ammonia and nitrites were a little higher than usual, not toxic levels, but higher than I like to keep it. I have one corydora, and he seems to be fine, but  I'm not seeing OTHER signs of sickness. I do weekly 10-15% water changes, and about a week ago completely changed the gravel. My airater, filter and heater all seem to be working fine (78°F) and I do not see film, building eyes, spots or lacerations. I'm curious if dosing with an anti-parasitic AND a fungus medication will do further harm, being that I can't figure out the EXACT issue??  It's strange that my ammonia would be higher than normal because I feed the same amount daily, and I never change my filter cartridges (just rinse everyone in a while) to keep healthy beneficial bacteria. My mind is blown and I don't want to lose my babies, but don't know what else I can do. I'm also at odds as to quarantine the ones that are at the top and JUST treat them, or to treat the entire tank, if treating them IS the general recommendation. "
257,Is 12 too old for a cat to move to Australia?,"We want to move our 12-year-old cat from Korea to Australia. A year and a half ago, our vet said our cat was healthy, and the person looking after her in Korea says our cat is still healthy. But my girlfriend is worried that the cat is too old for the stress of moving countries. Supposedly, they cat will need to be caged in Korea for a month, before flying to Melbourne (24 hours total) and being caged in Melbourne quarantine for at least a week. There, she'll get needles for vaccinations, which freaked her out last time she got them. What is the chance her ears will be permanently damaged from the altitude of the flight? What is the likelihood of our cat dying? If she doesn't die, will her life be shortened by much from the stress?  "
258,"My cat has been terrified by something outside at night, what could it be?","I have a neutered tom as well as a neutered female and a (not for long) unneutered female kitten- all three strictly indoors. Over the past week or so, the tom has been getting increasingly agitated by something outside- the first night I noticed it, he was making that low cry for help cats make when you take them to the vet, and when I went out to check on him he crouched down and crawled towards me, as though scared of something outside.   Whatever bothered him seems to be sticking around the area, as the tom now lies by the sliding glass door every night waiting to see if whatever it was returns- if it does, he makes a terrible furious screech and tries to attack it through the glass.   Last night, he was so agitated that he didn’t recognise me at first when I went out to check on him and even hissed at me before realising who I was. What could possibly be freaking him out so much? I put up a trail cam in the backyard to try and catch whatever it is on camera, and at last night’s disturbance I thought I had gotten it- except, for some reason there were 0 photos on the SD card (despite the fact that we also have dogs- there should at least be pictures of them), so I’m out of luck on that front.  Could it be another tom, hanging around the house for the kitten perhaps? Or something more wild like a raccoon?   It’s very worrying and disturbing to see my cat so upset over something I can’t seem to see- any ideas of what it is would be of great help. "
259,What are these critters in my tank?,"[website]I have a separate tank that I want to use for breeding. Last week, I had my gourami breeding pair in there. But, then, my angelfish laid eggs on my glass cleaner, so I took the gouramis out and put the angelfish eggs in. The temperature is around 27 Celcius. The eggs all turned grey and none hatched. But, now I see these other critters on all the surfaces.  I think they may be daphnia, water fleas. But I'm not sure, having never seen them before. So I'm looking for verification, or information on what they actually are.  Also, could these critters have caused the failure of the angel eggs hatching?  Do I need to get rid of these before I try to breed the gouramis again, or are they a good source of food for the breeding gouramis and their fry?  UPDATE 1  It looks like they could also be ostracod, copepod, or amphipod. It would help if I could get a better view of them!  UPDATE 2  [website]I've been dosing the tank with yeast, as per fedding daphnia. The critters seem to be doing well. They're not getting bigger, but they're active. After adding yeast the water clears up in two to three days. It's still not a certainty, though.  UPDATE 3  Confirmed, these are copepods of the cyclops variety. I was able to borrow a microscope and take a look. Pictures for the pleasure of the reader:    "
260,My cat is eating grass when take out for a walk,Whenever I take my cat out for a morning walk every now and then she starts eating grass. What may be the reason behind it? Is this normal? 
261,5-Month-Old Puppy Barks/Growls When Other People Play With Him,"I have a 5-month-old Shepherd/Lab mix who's generally very sweet -- but I've noticed that if people play with them a bit he gets a bit tense and barks at them until I tell him to stop. Not necessarily rough play but just things like dancing around him or play putting their forehead against his a few times or circling his head, etc.  Since he's only five months old, I was hoping I could train him out of this. I've been attempting to expose him to as much as possible as a puppy so he doesn't get freaked out about things, so I suppose it's partially just that he hasn't been around a ton of people and especially ones that play with him as opposed to just petting.  Is there a way to expose him more to this behavior without making him more aggressive? (Also is part of this him thinking that people he doesn't know that play like this he should play with like he plays with dogs?) "
262,Hostile hamster - Biting hands whilst holding,"I recently got a Syrian hamster at the age of seven weeks. Now, at the age of three months, he is not curiously nibbling me, but actually biting until I am bleeding (three times already). What am I supposed to do?   Background story: We had a rather unpleasant first day: he desperately attempted to escape his cardboard box we got him in (see also the opening scene of Jurassic Park). Later that night I tried to reconcile and have him on my hand. Unfortunately he jumped of and we had a chase. Short story, lot of poo, lot of screaming and a trauma for the both of us.    Weeks passed and things got better. I gave him food out of my hand, gave him treats after being in the big ball and all, and I could even pet him while he was eating. This was the moment where I thought I could try to hold him (with one hand covering him a bit), so I could have him in my hands out of the cage. But this is the point where it all changed. He became very vicious when I held him and bit me very hard. From that point on, I couldn't even put my hand in the cage without the hamster biting me.   Is there a chance that he stops this behavior, or is the possibility to bond gone?  "
263,Is it healthy for a pitpull puppy to spend months in one place without leaving?,"I have a puppy of almost 4 months who lives in the roof of the building where I live.  The problem is that because of my work it is impossible for me to take her for a walk, the most I could do is take her out for a walk every 2 months.   And so it will be for at least another 2 continuous years.  Would it be good for the puppy to have a life like that?  Are there bad consequences about this?  Or should I look for a home in which she can walk frequently?  The puppy is very affectionate with me by the way and I really don't like the idea of looking for a new home with other people. "
264,How should I decide between a collar and a harness for a dog?,"Of all of the dogs that have been part of my family, we have only used collars for leashing.  We've never had any negative experiences with them, but my parent's boxer has a habit of pulling when he sees something (or someone) he wants to go visit.  He is so physically strong, trying to restrain him can cause his collar to dig into his throat.  Would a harness help with this situation?    Would it provide better control given his size and strength? "
265,How much dominance is normal in 2 cats at play,"I have 2 cat's, one is young (8 months) and the other is 1.5 years old. During play, the older cat always takes the role of the chaser and the younger cat always runs away. I had read somewhere that during play, cats should switch off who is chasing and who is being chased. The younger cat provokes the older cat into chasing her by batting at him when he is close and generally being a provoking younger sibling.   The issue that arises is that after the chase has concluded, the older cat puts the younger cat in the equivalent of a chokehold, which often results in the younger cat resorting to hissing at the older cat, indicating that the older cat has taken it a step too far.  My question is, is this type of behavior normal? Does the older cat normally take the role of the aggressor constantly and always chase the younger cat, or is this some type of dominance play? "
266,Why does my dog act differently outside the house?,"My dog Rex is like two dogs in one.  In the house, he is cuddly, playful, and docile.  My mom describes him as ""a big mush"".  He gets along with my nieces and nephews, and doesn't even bark [save the rare occasion someone walks down my driveway that he doesn't know].  Outside, totally different story.  He walks with almost his entire weight over his front paws; he has his ears up and tail stiff (actually it's hard to tell because his tail is broken); and he will lunge at basically any moving object we come across [I actually don't know what triggers this behavior; I have another question about something similar].  He pulls on the leash, and essentially refuses to walk anywhere except in front of me. He smells and urinates on everything, often kicking dirt when he's done. He completely ignores me, so badly that even if I grab him by the snout and point his face at me, he keeps his eyes glancing sideways.  It has been suggested to me that Rex is afraid, or simply stressed when outside, and I certainly don't doubt it.  My question is: how do I calm him down? How do I carry some of the amazing inside behavior over to our outside walks?  [I understand this is a difficult question, that would require a lot of work.  I am simply asking for some first steps in the right direction.] "
267,Counterbalancing air flow and humidity in a tortoise enclosure,"I'm in the process of designing a new enclosure for my Redfoot tortoise.  As a South American breed, she needs a lot of moisture, which at present I am providing via moistening her substrate (sphagnum moss).  I am thinking of changing her substrate (see Is there a substrate for a Redfoot tortoise that won&#39;t retain excess moisture?), but a more pressing question for me is whether (essentially) sealing off her new enclosure to allow for maximum moisture retention will leave her with insufficient airflow.  Common sense would dictate that I would leave a few holes in the outside to allow air to pass, but how do I know if she has enough?  Is it practical to ""bubble"" in oxygen with whatever humidity source I ultimately choose? "

269,Cat's family of my boyfriend has been scared of everyone for 13 years,"I wanted to ask the community about a cat's attitude I have yet never seen before. So a couple of months ago  I got introduced to my  boyfriend's family. I noticed they had two beautiful bengal cats. My boyfriend told me that they are mum and daughter and are 13 and 12 years old. I tried to approach the mum cat and as soon as she saw my feet she escaped. My boyfriend explained to me that she is a very skittish cat.and she doesn't let anyone approaching her. I asked how this was possible. He explained to me that when she was little, she witnessed her brother getting killed by a car and since then she is traumatised and doesn't let any human approaching her. The only time where they managed to catch her after the accident was when she needed to get sterilised.  Since then she has never interacted with a human. The cat never enters the house and stays in the garden. What is strange to me is that I have noticed that she doesn't interact with other cats either . She doesn't play at all, and mostly sit in a corner. I thought it was due to her age but my boyfriend told me that she has always been like that except when she got her babies and was acting normally with them. She feels that everything and everybody is a threat: I tried to play with her by throwing her a ball in a very gentle way and she got scared and hid under a car.   My boyfriend's family seems OK with the situation and gave up on trying to make her more sociable. Basically they just feed her and that is all. He did say that they asked for advice and solutions  from vets but no-one seemed to know how to help this poor cat   Has anyone heard anything like that before? Is there a way to help this cat? I am looking forward for your answers "
270,Is this territorial or harsh play?,"So I have a female cat that has already had a litter of kittens and we decided to keep one of them. He is about 4 months old, well mommy cat got pregnant again and just had 2 babies (idk how many she'll have through the night) but I found the male kitten we kept either playing way to rough or just straight up trying to kill one of the kittens because it has blood and wounds all over it. I have no idea what to do about this situation and since I don't think they're safe I put him outside for the night. Has anyone ever heard or witnessed anything like this??? I have no idea what to do and if I should stay worried  "
271,How do I help a dog with a swollen paw,"Our elderly terrier has a swollen back foot - one of his pads seems to be the issue and he has trouble walking. We've been keeping it clean and dry and trying to help him on rougher ground where possible.  What should we be doing - would putting booties on him help or be a problem? considering its foot pads, should we be bandaging it? Is there anything we should be doing in the short term that can help with the swelling? "
272,Dog Attacks People he Knows on the Swing,"I have a white factor collie mix by the name of Shea, he is approximately 3/4 Collie and 1/4 Australian Shepherd (and 6 years old). These details my prove to be unnecessary however I am including them nonetheless.   He is the most relaxed dog I have ever met. I have two younger brothers, one of which is a baby and he lets both of them crawl all over him--and not once has he complained, at all.   However, he has one major issue with the swings.  It has happened many many times, that when either myself, younger brothers or anyone else he recognizes decides to get on a swing he becomes a completely different animal, barking and attacking whoever is on the swing.   This has been the case for 6 years.   Important details to note:   It seems as if it is the case he only attacks people he knows, which led me to believe that he was concerned for our safety--thinking we were being hurt by the swing. I do not let him get near anyone on the swing however it has happened a couple times that when walking past a random person on the swing, he pays no attention to them whatsoever. After spending some time with a friend of mine, he started attacking him on the swing.  I am able to hold him when people he knows are swinging, he tries to get loose but does not act aggressively towards me when I am holding him. The actual swinging seems to be what bothers him. If I am merely sitting on the swing he is not as bothered by it.  I have tried holding and consoling him when he's watching someone he knows swing, it calms him down a bit but if I were to let go he would still go after and attack the person on the swing.    My Main Questions:   Is there even anything to be done about this, or is this simply just my dog, and changing this behavior is impossible for this specific situation? Was my initial thought that he is doing it out of concern accurate? Has anyone else dealt with swing-terrified dogs?  "
273,Why is my cat attacking my face & what can I do to stop it?,"I have a recent issue exacerbated by the fact that I'm allergic to cats. We adopted a cat ~4 years ago, and she took a liking to me. These past couple years I'm her ""favorite"", she ignores the other people in the house, and enjoys spending as much time as she can either curled on me or near me. She is needy, almost too needy for me. She will completely ignore someone else's offer for pets and attention and will spend almost all her 'social' time trying to get my attention or at least lay against me.  She had an old problem where she would randomly attack people. Over time we learned that this was generally overstimulation and we just weren't paying attention to her ""Done"" signals when she wanted out. Usually this would be her attacking the arm or hand of whoever was petting her. However with some (people) training, this isn't a problem we have really had this past year or two.  A few weeks ago, she attacked my face. As far as I can remember, I had just laid down in bed ~3am, and she was begging for attention (she loves pets on the bed). She laid down near me, I pet her for a bit, passed out, then woke up to her mauling my face.  Just today she did it for a second time. She was sleeping on my lap, went off to eat, then came back laying on my lap. I'm working, so I didn't really give her much attention beyond when I welcomed her on my lap. She's usually fine with this, and is perfectly normal. Randomly she leaps up and again mauls my face.  The common things I know that lead into this is eye contact (was staring at the screen), and overstimulation (I was not touching her). I'm concerned there's some signal I'm missing out on, and more concerned that it's somehow understimulation (she's mad that I'm not giving her attention) since I frankly cannot give her as much attention as she often wants.  The other coincidence is that both attacks happened the day after my girlfriend took off for a trip, though it's too few times to really know if that's at all a factor. She does give the cat some attention, but the cat usually ignores her.  Any ideas on why this might be happening? Any ideas on what I can do to prevent this issue? "
274,Is a carbon or cartridge filter necessary in an aquarium with a simple biofilter?,"I'm trying to setup my first aquarium, and in the process I've been reading all about the nitrogen cycle and properly cycling a tank to ensure there's bacteria present to work on the ammonia and nitrites that end up in the water.  I've been looking at different kinds of biofilters, and it seems like it doesn't take anything particularly elaborate for the bacteria to live on. Some of the best rated ones are little more than a couple of ribbed sponges on a plastic pipe like this one.    What I'm wondering is, if I use something like this to act as a biofilter, do I need (or is it even a good idea) to use a regular filter (with carbon or a cartridge filter or whatever) in tandem with the biofilter? Is it better to decide one way or the other, and then stick with it, or should I use both?  I'm just concerned that the bacteria on the biofilter will somehow be adversely affected by the presence of another filter that's pulling ammonia and waste products, etc out of the water too. I don't know if they work well together, or are mutually exclusive. "
275,My cat behaves very strange and apathetic and doesn't eat,"We have a cat, Gato who went away five days ago and returned two days ago (which is a very long time for a cat as they return at least once per day when they get food).   After returning back he just slept the whole day, didn't eat and all in all looked very ""depressed"". We thought he just needed some sleep as he was walking very long. But he didn't stop and he didn't sleep anyway. He is just sitting there next to the water, looking into it and doing nothing. Yesterday he almost fell into the water, he can't walk on straight lines sometimes and he doesn't eat.   He doesn't look sick, his eyes are normal, his fur is a little bit messy (probably from his adventure) but he doesn't look good either.   So what could be wrong with him and how can I help him?  I already asked my parents to take him to the vet but they don't want to and say that everything's ok with him. What should I do? "
276,Is black cat hard to get adopted?,"I watched YouTube video: [website]At 5:59  He said black cat is hard to get adopted. Is black cat ugly or something? Actually,where I live,some people do not like black dog and cat,especially elder. Because they believe they will bring them misfortune. But I don't know how do people think in Western culture. "
277,Switching from set times for feeding to free feeding of a cat,"My cat Shiloh I believe the amount of food the vet recommended is not enough for him, I picked him up tonight and he is losing weight.  The amount the vet said to use was to maintain, so it is failing to maintain his weight.  What I give him now is 1/4 of dry food in the AM, 1 small can of wet food when I get home from work.  Right now he wakes me up at 1 or 2 in the morning for more food.  So I see 2 options  1) add a third mean at night before I go to bed (1/4 dry)  I am adding 50% as I felt he has lost weight and I think he needs it back.  2) figure out how to transition him to a free feeding cat (keep the dry food out all the time for him when he wants, then a can of wet food as a treat when I get home from work in the pm.  If I am to switch to free feeding, what is the best way, would it be just put a bigger bowl down and fill it up?  Or do I want to build up to the big bowl, and if so how? "

279,How does clicker training stick when a cat or a dog knows there's no treat?,"I'm really curious as to how clicker training works. I mainly care and ask for cats but I'm also generally curious for dogs.  So, I've looked into it for both cats and dogs and it's common to both that you basically tell them that if they do something which is the behavior you want, they get a treat! Yay! let's do it more and get the human to give more treats! (and the clicker is just to help communicating and identifying the exact behavior).  So simply put:     Your cat quickly learns that he can get you to give him a treat by performing a certain behavior.      - Cat Clicker Training   Well, I've seen cats and dogs following their owner's asking (or ""commands"") even when they know the owner clearly doesn't have any treat. So why do they do it? do they just do it because they now know their human wants them to? if so how come just petting and showing affection isn't just as effective as treats, or even more for being more direct? and if so, does that mean at some point you can clicker train without any treats, just clicker? "
280,What does my cockatiel's 'toot' sound mean?,"My cockatiel likes to make this short, kind sound: 'Toot'. It sounds a bit like a very short train flute. She seems to make this sound whenever I appear from another room or come around a corner. Recently she also started saying this to my two cats whenever they appear (which btw go very well along).   I suspect it means 'Hi' or something close, but I find no information on this on the web. Is it something my cockatiel has ""invented"", or is it a common sound? If it's common, what does it usually mean? I also wonder if this sound is part of what is called 'chirping'? As English is not my mother language I'm not sure of what sounds are considered chirping.  "
281,"I think my cat is afraid of our carpet, how do I help her recover?","My cat is normally a very active pet, however for the past few days she will avoid carpet at all costs. For example, she will sit at our two kitchen stools  and if we try to move her, she will quickly run back there. In fact, she only gets on the carpet to eat/drink and go to the litter box. If you move her off of those stools, she will go on another hard platform such as a counter-top.   Coincidentally(?) we've also had a flea problem in the past few days. We've been trying to get rid of them and also giving her flea baths (which she loves), a collar, etc. I don't know if cats are smart enough to connect the dots, but I hate seeing her like this. Is there something else wrong with her? How do I help her out?  "
282,How much will intestinal surgery affect my cat?,"My cat ate a balloon a few days ago. Sadly, she didn't manage to digest it, so tomorrow the vet will perform an intestinal surgery to remove it from her intestines.  How much will this surgery affect her? I imagine she will have to eat only diet food for the days following. Will the recovery be long and painful for her? Will she recover totally after this surgery? "
283,Is it OK to pet cat / let her lick me while she is cleaning herself? (and general cleaning behavior),"I have a healthy kitten ~9 weeks old, long-haired, seems to have good cleaning habits (I found her at 8 weeks).  She likes to jump up on my lap and clean herself, which is fine. Sometimes when she's cleaning herself she'll clean my hand or arm too (if my hand or arm are near where she's cleaning herself sometimes she'll just switch over to me for a while), which is also not causing any harm. Sometimes I'll pet her while she's cleaning herself if she's on my lap; because I want to reinforce good cleaning behavior (I don't want her to end up being Stinky McCrustybutt some day).  I have a few questions related to the risk of interfering with her normal cleaning habits:   How does a cat know when to stop cleaning herself? Do they stop when they are clean? Or when they have covered a certain amount of their body? Or do they just clean as much as they can in a certain amount of time? When does a cat's cleaning behavior fully ""set in""? That is, at 8-10 weeks, for example, can her cleaning behavior still change or is it pretty much done (and therefore nothing I do can make it better or worse)? I read somewhere that sometimes cats interpret humans petting them as humans cleaning them. Is it bad to pet my cat while she is cleaning herself -- will she think I am cleaning her and so not clean herself completely because she assumes I'm doing some of the work? If she interprets it as praise is this also bad because she might end up never cleaning herself unless I am also petting her?  Is it bad to let her lick me while she is cleaning herself? Will this somehow use up her... ""cleaning points"" so that she spends time cleaning my hand when she should be cleaning herself instead? If I shouldn't let her do this, how can I stop her without discouraging her from being affectionate to humans in general?  Actually, 4b. She only really cleans the parts of me that happen to be near her, and only when she's cleaning herself. Does she actually know she's licking my hand (and not licking herself) or is she just sort of in robot-self-cleaning mode licking everything in range?  "
284,How old should a puppy be whenever you adopt them?,"I realize that a dog can never be too old to adopt, my parents just adopted a fairly senior citizen schnauzer.  However, how young is too young to adopt a puppy?  It's been a while, but I think we adopted our dachshund whenever he was about 8 to 10 weeks (maybe earlier).  Is there is a suggested age, what are some of the ramifications or reasons behind it?  Consider the answer to How can I find out if a dog I am considering is from a puppy mill? which mentions:     If you're selling a puppy in less than 8 weeks you're damaging the   overall health of the puppy.  "
285,How can I stop food mixture from dissociating in water?,I've been trying a new way of feeding my turtle by mixing a variety of vegetables with chicken and/or prawns. I do so by mincing everything then combining them and crushing them together. I then form them into balls.   The problem is that they dissociate once placed in water. I know dehydration might be a solution but I do not have a dehydrator and I think placing them in the sun will get unwanted organisms eating them and probably contaminating them.   Are there any other ways to prevent dissociation? And if no then what is the best way of dehydration that minimises nutrient loss and avoids contamination? 
286,What species of wild rabbit is the domestic house rabbit descended from?,"This question comes from a discussion related to How do you groom an Angora Rabbit? it has been suggested that the Angora is not directly descended from the European rabbit, but rather a Turkish species. It was also suggested that as many as three wild species have been combined to create the domestic rabbit.  The Wikipedia article on domestic rabbits implies they all come from the European rabbit or common rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus).  Several countries in Europe and Africa surrounding the Mediterranean Sea are listed in the article as native territory for the European rabbit.  The Angora is thought to come from Turkey (also on the Mediterranean Sea) but possibly from a different native source.     The Angora rabbit is thought to have originated from Ankara (formerly known as Angora) in Turkey... The characteristics of the Angora coat are caused by an autosomal recessive gene. ufaw.org   There are multiple references clearly stating that ""wild and domestic rabbits can not interbreed"", nor can any of the rabbit species interbreed with each other.      Domesticated rabbits ... cannot breed with cottontail rabbits or hares. hopperhome.com      Rabbits and hares are not the same. They differ genetically and do not interbreed in nature. Cottontails and domestic rabbits cannot interbreed. Nor can hares or jackrabbits interbreed with cottontails or domestic rabbits. bunnyworld.com      The various species of rabbits do not interbreedModern Livestock &amp; Poultry Production By James Gillespie, Frank Flanders (2009)   To confuse the issue there are other references suggesting several species of rabbits have been domesticated.     Although species within Lagomorpha are derived from a common ancestor... Several species have been selected as domestic animals plosone.org   The following was offered of the wide spread heritage of the domestic rabbit:     Another link: bunnyhugga.com/a-to-z/general/history-rabbits.html It claims the french started domestication but there is evidence in many roman empire era ruins of rabbit pens including Pompeii. I remember seeing a picture one in National Geographic from the Pompeii excavations. –  Critters post   But earlier in the same article:     There are currently more than 60 recognised breeds of domestic rabbit in Europe and America, all of them descended from the European rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus), the only species of rabbit to have been widely domesticated. It is a seperate species from other native rabbits such as the North American jackrabbits and cottontail rabbits and all species of hares. www.bunnyhugga.com   There is room for confusion, in tracing the heritage of the domestic rabbit  Looking for answers with high quality reliable reference clearing indicating, that (Oryctolagus cuniculus) is the only wild rabbit in domestic rabbit heritage or identifying other wild rabbits that are included in domestic rabbit heritage.

287,How to stop dogs from urinating on my entrance?,"I don't have any pets, but people in my neighborhood walk their dogs in my street. In doing so, the dogs urinate on the wall just outside our front door. This is very annoying because it stains the (white!) porous wall in a very obvious and ugly way, and there's plenty of grass and wall literally one meter away. I'm trying not to get mad at the perpetrators but it's beyond me how dog owners can be so inconsiderate. I mean, it's right next to my front door!   I haven't ""caught anyone in the act"" but it's probably futile (or even counterproductive!) to put up a sign. So I have to find a solution that will repel the dogs, not the owners.  How can I prevent dogs from peeing on that spot?  Google results suggest things like vinegar, bleach, citronella, as well as some special sprays that probably aren't available in my country. Do those methods work? I'd rather not try out stuff that might cause more damage than what's already there. "
288,Should a change in feeding schedule be gradual or abrupt?,"My 2-year-old Hovawart currently has feeding times at 9 in the morning and again at 6 in the afternoon. In a month I will be starting evening classes so I have to change the feeding schedule to noon and 9 in the evening.  Is it better to gradually shift the feeding times towards the new schedule during the month, or just start with the new schedule abruptly? Is constant small change in the routine better or worse than one big change?  He's not the kind of dog that gets easily stressed over a change in routine, but I figure why not do it the ""right"" way anyway. "
289,Can't tell if cats are playing with or hunting each other,"We've got 2 cats at home at the moment, both neutered. Our cat is a male ~9-10 months old and my brother brought his for the summer, which is a female ~11-12 months old.  They've met before and during those encounters our male was arching his back and hissing, but she is generally relaxed, not paying him much mind from the looks of things (or she could be distracted by her surroundings). He has displayed territorial behavior since she is placed in my brother's room, with him, which is normally open and vacant when my brother isn't staying here and the male likes to sleep in that room.  Here's the question though: When they notice each other from under the door, they'll both be glued there trying to poke at each other under it. There is no hissing, no aggression (our male gets aggravated if he's disturbed but it isn't hard to distract him, unless the female is meowing). We can't tell if this is playing or hunting and we can't tell if they understand who's on the other side.   is it reasonable to assume they know there's a cat on the other side? is it reasonable to assume they know which cat is on the other side, since they do sniff under the door occasionally? is it reasonable to assume they haven't yet associated each other's scent and identity to their appearances?   and of course   is it possible to get them to identify each other if they can get close enough to get a scent? (they have been close but only once and the male was aggressive while the female was in her cage)   Thanks and sorry for the wall of questions.  edit - followup question here "
290,Temperature Range for Fancy Goldfish,"I have an aquarium housing moors and an oranda. What is a safe temperature range for these fish? There seems to be conflicting information on this online.  My aquarium is in a conservatory and in the middle of winter the water temperature can get as low as 8c/45f and in the middle of summer (currently) it can get as high as 30c/86f.  Last winter I only had moors and noticed no ill effects of the lower temperature. Some online sources seem to suggest orandas are more sensitive to temperature than other types of fancy goldfish, is this correct? Next winter I will most likely heat the water, but to what temperature?  With the increased water temperature in summer the only difference in behaviour I have noticed is that the fish will occasionally go to the top of the tank to get air, presumably due to the hotter water having lower oxygen levels. The use of an air stone seems to stop this behaviour. Are there any other risks at this temperature?  "
291,What antibiotics are generally safe for rabbits?,My vet mentioned that not all antibiotics are safe for rabbits.  What antibiotics are safe to give to rabbits? Does the route (oral vs injectable) make a differences? Is there a frequency or duration limit that is different from other animals that can use the same medicine?  
292,What antibiotics should not be given to a rabbit?,"My vet mentioned that not all antibiotics are safe for rabbits. Which antibiotics should not be given to a rabbit?  What are the adverse effects?    Note I would like to also ask if there is antidote or treatment if one the 'don't give rabbit antibiotics' is accidentally given.  If this does not make the question overly broad, please include this information in your answer. If too complex I will ask separately.  "
293,Using the room door as a means of introducing cats to each other slowly,"tl;dr: is a slightly ajar door a good way to introduce cats that have been playing with each other under it without showing aggression?  We have two cats, neutered - the male is the resident house cat and the female is my brother's, who came home for the summer.  They play a lot under the door and don't show signs of aggression when doing so, although the male has shown signs of feeling threatened by the female in the past (single encounter a week ago and a couple months ago). I already asked a question trying to discern if they're playful with each other or just toying with the door here and I feel confident they can get along, if they meet properly and slowly.    We've been thinking of using the door, by opening it just enough so they can see each other and get close enough without being able to paw at each other (the door being slightly ajar enough for looks but not claws) as a means of taking their introduction to the next step, safely. I'm thinking that's a good idea as we can just shut the door if they get too agitated, they'll both have escape routes, they won't be so afraid of each other and any interference by us (namely, shutting the door) won't get us directly involved, thus making them feel we're getting in the way. In fact, I thought of doing it while they're playing under the door, so that it'll be easier for them to identify what cat they're looking at.  However, we're also worried it might agitate the male because he won't be able to enter. I think it won't be a bigger factor than his fear of the female, but we're unsure.  Is this a good way to further the introduction or is it more detrimental to them getting along than helpful? "
294,Kitten development / spatial awareness,"I have two cats; one is 14 years and I've had him since birth, the other is 9-10 weeks and I found her outside two weeks ago.  I recall with the adult cat at around 6 weeks old he had noticed the shelf that we stored the food on, and very noticeably plotted a path to get up there by jumping on other objects (you could see him observing the path) even though he physically couldn't follow the path. He also never forgot it was there and continued to try very frequently a few days in a row. He was sometimes clumsy with balance but nothing that struck me as unusual. Today, he has good navigation and spatial awareness, he has no problem remembering where toys are while playing, plotting complex paths, you can fake him out by pretending to throw things.  My kitten, on the other hand, at 9-10 weeks doesn't have nearly the same object and navigation skills that my other cat had at 6. She's very sweet and extremely active, and unusually fearless. She's a good learner as far as training goes, and she has no problem remembering where things are in the house (like food, litter boxes, water, play areas). But e.g. she forgets where toys are immediately when they are behind her; when she jumps over a toy she will look for it and sometimes mew and sniff around until I put it in front of her, similar to when I take the toy away completely. This morning she was hunting a moth; but lost track of it every time she trapped it under her paw, and had great trouble following it after she grounded it. She also simply cannot follow objects moving above a certain speed; for example if I move my hand quickly in front of her, she looks to where it was then is startled when she discovers where it is, even though I stayed in her field of view. I have a fort-type thing that I built for her out of milk crates, which she loves, but if I hold a toy inside one rather than attempt to find a path around she will pace and become frustrated trying to get at it from the outside despite having spent significant time playing in and around the structure. Also, when she is sitting on my lap / chest, it is very difficult for her to stay there; she will somehow manage to slide or fall off of me within about a minute even though she is clearly trying to relax or sleep or clean. 100% of the time that she cleans herself, she falls over, even on flat ground. When she sleeps, her head and limbs drift in such mysterious ways that I'm convinced there's a special sideways pointing gravity that only affects her, and she often falls off of things while sleeping or sitting. She seems to have generally good balance when walking on narrow things. She can't jump very high although I don't remember how high my other cat could jump at that age and don't have other kittens to compare her to.  I used to block her from falling off of me with my arm but I've stopped in the hopes that the feedback will encourage her to work on balance and awareness of her surroundings. I've been shaking toys around in places that are complicated to get to and giving her a treat when she gets there (but I almost always have to lead her through the path), and setting up boxes, crates, and platforms in all sorts of complex and interesting ways for her to explore.  My question is: Is she at a normal level of development -- should I be concerned about her ""drifting"", not being able to find ways around things, and losing things the instant she can't see them? If so, what can I do to help her along and build up these skills?   I only have my other cat to compare her to, and I'm not sure if he was ahead, she is behind, or they're both in pretty normal range. I am not sure if my expectations are too high; I may be wrong in comparing my two cats. The out-of-sight out-of-mind thing I can understand (although she seems a bit old for that?) because people are the same, but the strange falling off of things (almost ""melting"" off, which I can't really explain well) and navigation problems seem off.  I've been trying to do some research, and I know cat behavior is well studied, but for some reason I can't seem to find any good information about motor skill and neurological development in cats; all the info I find is about behavior and physical appearance.

296,How To Train a Cat 3 Questions?," He meows at me, as soon as I get out of bed, for food. I used to feed him in the morning, but then started to feed him at dinner and he meows throughout the day anytime we go into the dinning room or kitchen (which is probably most of the day), which is where we keep his food and food bowl. I thought this might also stop him from trying to get our food while we are eating it, but it doesn't and he continues to meow for food after he has done eating. So how do I stop him from meowing all day and trying to eat our food? He claws everything. I even got him two scratching posts. He uses them, but still scratches on the couch and bed. I don't know how to stop him. He eats really fast. I got a rock and put it in his bowl, but this doesn't help. Plus he doesn't even move himself towards food. He paws at it to move it towards him. And he's rough when he eats, so he pushes the food bowl all over the place and spills water everywhere. Is there a way to stop him from eating so fast and pushing the bowl everywhere?  "
297,German Spitz type?,"We have this new member of our family.      The breeder told us that he is a german spitz small. But when i checked the sizes of that type, if it is above 30 cm height from shoulder then it should be german spitz medium. This bad boy in the picture is 13 weeks old and already 25 cm long from the shoulder. They say dogs usually grow a lot between 4 months-6 months and he is not even 4 months old. Does that mean he is gonna be a larger dog than a spitz small? I mean 5 cm does not seem too much. What do you think guys? Is he a medium size spitz?  Thank you. "
298,Can small snails bite medium size gold fish?,"I have a 10 gallon aquarium and have one medium size goldfish in the tank. About a month ago, I decided to purchase couple of live plants. Once I got it, I simply planted it into the tank without cleaning the plants. About a week later, I saw a small snail. I was surprise to see it but not alarmed. Then, 3 days later 2 more. On a closer inspection, I saw many what looked like snail eggs on the plants and on the glass. Today, I was looking at the tank and found many tiny snails. Plus, it looks like my gold fish was bitten by something. On one side of the fish, it looks like something took a big bite of the fish. So, is my goldfish of 7 years doomed and is going to die? and Will I be able to get rid of the snails out of my tank? I think I have snail infestation... "

301,Is it necessary to wet hard feeds?,"Is it necessary to wet grains, pellets or even chaff? Are there particular ingredients that one should look out for?  In Australia chaff is routinely mixed with horse feeds. This is a practice that is not common to all parts of the world. Chaff is a good way to administer vitamins, minerals and salt, any other additives that a horse may need, when a horse doesn't need to be hard fed. "

304,my lab mopes when my daughter goes home,"I have a 4 year old lab. He's the happiest dog I've ever had, you just look at him and he starts wagging. My daughter (she's grown) comes to visit me and my wife every 6 months or so, my lab is in total love with her. As soon as she gets out of her truck he goes insane to get to her to love her up. I don't understand it. He's been like this since he was a puppy with her, she's the only one he'll lick, he licks her face, he sits on or beside her and follows her everywhere and waits by her door in the morning and goes crazy when she gets up. He loves us and is always happy but when she comes it puts him into a whole other world it's like he's euphoric. When she goes back home he mopes around for a day or so. Why??? "
305,What do I do if my puppy's worms burrow into the floor!,"I own 2 dogs, one of them have worms (2 months) while the other doesn't (7 years).

"
306,Why is my cat gagging?,"On a fairly regular basis, my cat will do this thing where it looks like she's going to throw up, but then she only gags and nothing happens. One way to describe the motion would be a person who gags / acts like they're going to throw up but then covers their mouth like you'd see in a sitcom. Obviously my cat doesn't cover her mouth, but everything else is basically the same.  I've mentioned in a previous question that my cat likes to eat non-edible things such as paper, plastic, etc. I've made a conscious effort to hide any and all plastic over the last year, and I am fairly confident that she has not eaten any plastic in the last 8-12 months. She does occasionally manage to bite and chew a small piece of paper, but that seems to happen pretty infrequently and typically with only a very small piece of paper.  Why could she be doing this? Is it because of her past eating habits? Is it because she's a long haired cat and licks herself basically all day (i.e. she swallows a lot of fur)? Is there anything I could do with her diet to potentially help? "
307,My dog covers food and water bowls with sand,"we just built a new home.  We brought our Staffie, Bella, to house last weekend (7 days ago) for a pre-moving in overnight stay so she can get to know the environment. Those 2 days she looked depreseed and developed diahorea and would not eat.  Last night we brought her for her first night.  We put her doghouse right by the back door and her food and water bowls next to it.  I got up at 4am to get her indoors before sunrise.  I saw that she had completely covered her food and water bowls with sand.  When she heard me call, she came out of her doghouse and covered her food with more sand before coming to me.  Very weird.  I believe this can be stress??  What can I do to help her relax and settle in with us?  The boundary walls are not yet done, so we keep her indoors most of the time (she loves running outside) and take for walks.  I hope she is okay.  Don't know what I can do for her. Many thanks "
308,Is an UV lamp dangerous for fish?,"Is the UV lamp useful for decorative freshwater (aquarium) fishes or may it be rather dangerous instead ?

310,How do I take care of a cat with a cold?,"I believe my cat has come down with a cold. I have had a light cold for the last week or so, and unfortunately I think I may have passed it onto her as she started sneezing regularly a few days ago.  What should I do to take care of her? Should I get her some kind of feline cold medicine, or just let her ride the cold out naturally? "
311,What are the most common dietary allergies in cats?,"We suspected a food allergy in one of my cats.  The course my vet recommended for this was to switch him to a special diet (containing no previously-eaten proteins) for a few months and then, if that made it better, re-introduce old proteins one at a time to see which he reacts to -- possibly with iterations.  My cat's allergy turned out not to be to food, but this got me wondering: many foods, both canned and dry, use a combination of ingredients, so he'd been exposed to all the biggies (chicken, turkey, beef, tuna, other seafood, etc) and possibly even to some of the less-common ones (lamb, duck, a stray mouse...).  If I were trying to isolate a food allergy, I'd have to pick one of those at a time to try.    Can we improve on random choice?  Is there any research on what are the most common food allergies in cats? "
312,How to let an indoor cat have some outdoors time safely?,"I have two indoor cats that have an abundance of energy and some behavior problems. I have read that allowing the cats outside occasionally can help with this behavior. Additionally, both cats constantly try to run out the front door when I come home.  I don't want to allow the cat to become an indoor/outdoor cat, but would supervised outside time be acceptable? I live in a 1st floor apartment and there is a small outdoor area that I could let the cats out into and watch them so they don't run away.  Is this a good approach or will it cause more issues with the cats trying to escape? "
313,What can I do about the black dots on my cat's chin?,"I got a new cat a couple weeks ago. She came from a shelter with a clean bill of health. Over the past few days, I've noticed that she's been developing some black spots on her chin that look a bit like acne. What's causing the spots? What can I do about it? Do I need to do anything about it?  I don't know if it matters, but she's an indoor cat now, being fed dry food. The shelter didn't know anything about her life before they got her.  The spots look pretty similar to the ones in this photo:    (Image source: [website]"
314,How can I encourage my kitten to leave my adult cat alone?,"We currently have two cats; one less than a year old and another around 6.   Our adult cat simply wishes to be left alone, but our kitten wants to play with anything and everything all the time, including the older cat. Multiple times a day, I hear a ""mrowgrrrrrmeow hissssssssssss"" as the kitten pounces on our poor older cat, who bats at the kitten before finding a new place to lounge. They are not hostile to each other at all outside of this, and they get along perfectly fine outside of the times the kitten decides she wants to play with the adult cat.  We eased them into the relationship with each other as recommended in this question, and they do just fine 99% of the time.  I understand the behaviors of both cats are 100% natural and justified as well.  Is there anything I can do to discourage the pestering of the older cat?    Would punishing the kitten for aggravating the adult cat be a viable option to condition her into not doing it? "
315,Why is my dog drinking his pee after he urinates inside?,"Every night, as soon as I turn off the last light in the house, if I've forgotten to take the dog (a 13-year-old miniature dachshund we obtained from a reputable breeder 11 years ago) out immediately prior, the dog will wake up within an hour and indicate he has to go out.  If I do not take him out, he will urinate on a bathroom throw rug.  Occasionally, he will try to drink / lick up whatever is caught in the carpet fibers.  He has water and food available to him and he seems to eat well.  We have a dog door, but he conducts this business after the house is shut for the night (we live in an area where many other types of critters could potentially enter said door when it is not monitored).  He uses the door just fine; the problem is that he urinates inside while we're all asleep, and he has to go because we either went to bed earlier than normal, or we just forgot to take him out before bed.  I don't think he's ashamed of having done what he's done, but he could be; I suspect he is bored.  Why is he doing this?  He doesn't do this when he goes in the grass; he doesn't even turn around to acknowledge it when we're outside; granted, it's already soaked down, but it should smell the same.    It's not his going inside that concerns me; I understand why that happens. It his post-business cleanup / drinking that is baffling.  Why does he do this? "
316,Why does my dog sing along to Final Jeopardy?,"I have had multiple scenarios where dogs I've owned or watched would consistently howl or sing at very specific things, and nothing else.  Scenario 1: Final Jeopardy  Whenever we babysat our friend's black-and-tan dachshund and watched Jeopardy, he would howl at the song used during Final Jeopardy.  Not the intro.  Not any of the outtakes of the song, but only when the song played during the part where everyone writes down their final answer.  He didn't even have to see the television screen to know to howl.  He just did it.  I have no video of this particular dog, and he has since passed, but apparently there are many videos of dogs on YouTube howling to Final Jeopardy.    Here are several sample videos of various dogs during Final Jeopardy:   Howling at Final Jeopardy Tune Dog Sings Jeopardy Gilbert Sings to Jeopardy Dog sings Jeopardy Show Song Aunt's dogs singing with Jeopardy Another Dog sings Jeopardy   At no point in these videos is any of these dogs rewarded for their behavior.  We never rewarded the dog we babysat for howling.  Scenario 2: Answering Machine  If our phone rang in the house and the answering machine picked up, once people started speaking to leave a message, both male dachshunds would howl and sing.  They would not do this on playback.  They also would not do this if the call came from inside the house.  While I found it adorable, I did not reward them for this behavior; I do not understand why they reacted like this every single time.  Of note, I think one dog howled and the other joined in, as one has since passed and the other doesn't do it anymore.  I never rewarded our dogs for this behavior.    Why do these dogs choose to howl at these very particular scenarios and only at those times and so consistently?  Are there specific tones in these sounds that might have enticed them to howl? "
317,How can I train a dog to behave with a cat?,"I have witnessed my neighbor's Golden Retriever misbehave with their Persian Cat. He puts the cat's tail in his mouth like a toy, removes much of the cat's hair with his mouth; essentially, he dominates the cat. The dog is only a puppy, maybe a few months old; the cat is maybe a year older. Cat is not declawed but very peaceful but dog is naughty and full of energy.  How can my neighbor train his dog so it behaves appropriately with a cat?  Are there other preventative methods he can employ? "
318,How long can a 1-year-old cat stay home alone?,"Whenever I go on vacation I leave my 1-year-old cat with my friend, who also has a cat.  My cat and his cat HATE each other, and I was wondering if I can leave my cat alone at home.  I plan to be gone for multiple weeks.    Is he old enough to stay home alone?    How long can he stay alone?    How much food would I need to leave with him?    Should I ask a neighbor/friend to come over to check on him, and if so, how frequently? "
319,How can I keep my cats safe in my car?,"When transporting one cat I put the carrier on the passenger seat (with the front grill facing me).  When transporting both, somebody gets the back seat (with the carrier similarly facing the center of the car).  I never gave this much thought until reading a news article about an auto accident that mentioned, in passing, that two cats had died (no further details).  That got me wondering about safe transport.  Carriers, being not people-shaped, don't interact well with the seatbelts in my car.  Should I be doing something to ""belt in"" the carriers, and if so what?  Or should I be thinking of doing something to the carriers themselves (what?) to reduce damage to the cat if a carrier were to go flying?  Would the passenger airbag deploying be a good thing or a bad thing?  Would everybody be better off if I put the carriers in the hatchback of my Honda Fit instead of on seats? "
320,Should I let my dog roll in the grass?,"My dog loves to roll in the grass, however, I heard it brings issues, mostly in the form of bugs, fleas, dirt, scratching or even allergies.   Are any of them true? Should I let my dog roll in the grass at all? "
321,How can I stop my dogs from scooting / dragging their butts?,"I currently have 3 dogs and all of them will periodically scoot their butts, slam their butts hard on the ground, and drag themselves. When it happens, I know their anal glands are bothering them and they're trying to relieve the pain and itchiness which comes with an irritated gland.  We have tried adding pumpkin to their diets, scoot bars and even considered a surgical option to have the glands removed.  The dogs are a 12-year-old Shih Tzu, 5-year-old Pug, and 8/9-month old Chihuahua/Yorkie mix, all with tails.  Until recently they were fed Science Diet dry food twice daily (AM / PM), but we recently switched to Hill's Ideal Balance.  How do I prevent them from scooting?  Are there certain dog foods (dry/wet) which might prevent the glands from becoming irritated? "
322,Why is adding hay to a rabbit's diet important?,These questions mention feeding rabbits hay:     What are healthy treats for a house rabbit?   How can I help my adult rabbit gain weight?   Why is adding hay to a rabbit's diet important?  I am particularly curious about potential health concerns throughout the life of the bunny that may be affected by feeding or withholding hay. 
323,Neon tetra with cotton mouth,"Update: mass seems to be turning a greyish colour and I also managed to get my own photos:      Quite a while ago I noticed a white mass on one of my neon’s mouths; he's now been given a name since he has been the focus of my studies for the past month - Simon. After a quick research, I concluded it was cotton mouth and immediately popped him into a quarantine tank to prevent my other fish catching it. Tank was cleaned, water change, etc. - all other fish are still fine and dandy.   When I first asked my question; I had already tried increasing the temperature, adding aquarium salts, using anti-bacterial treatments and acriflavine (not all at once). More recently, I've tried an anti-fungal treatment in case my initial diagnosis was incorrect, and since none of my previous methods had appeared to have worked. I think my fish's medicine cabinet is more-well stocked than my own now.   There is a small white circular mass, approximately 3mm in diameter protruding from Simon's mouth. Upon closer inspection, the mass appears to be attached only to the bottom lip, rather than the whole mouth; which I have read is a familiar character of this particular symptom, in multiple sources (here and here).   Simon has no other symptoms. From looking back at those two sources, Simon doesn't have any white spots, his fins are in great shape, there are no 'saddleback' lesions near the dorsal fin, his colours are as bright as ever, and he has a remarkable appetite. I might also mention that over the past four weeks, the white mass hasn't grown in size from what I've noticed.   I'm beginning to doubt that this is cotton mouth, but I also don't want to put Simon back into the main tank until I know for sure. How will I know when a fish has been cured from cotton mouth? Will the white mass disappear, or stay like a scar? Is Simon safe to be re-associated with his scaly brothers and sisters?  Side note. My main tank's water parameters are checked regularly and are within the recommended concentrations, likewise with the QT. The QT is 20l and he has it all to himself, so there is no rush to get him back into the main tank; I'm willing to take my time with this.   Are there any other illnesses/injuries which produce these symptoms? "
324,Betta fish fin tear or rot?,"  Does my fish have fin rot or is the tail simply torn?  I got him a few days ago and his fins were a bit like this, I'm unsure if it's gotten worse. He is in a cycled 16L tank with a filter, heater, gravel, live plants, driftwood, and a fake hollow log. His tank is the Blue Plant 16L kit which a quick Google search will give you specs.  He is alone, apart from a few bladder snails that I got with the plants, and I've been picking them out as I see them. Haven't seen any in a little while.  Just did a liquid test and ammonia is around 0-0.25ppm maybe? I have bad lighting, it's hard to tell in the evenings. I've dosed Prime and Stresscoat API and I'll do a water change tomorrow.  He is very active, happy, curious, and eats well. Doesn't act sick at all, but I want to make sure he won't go downhill. His ventral fins are also kind of curled at the ends.   What are your thoughts on what that is?  P.S. The gravel is quite large and not the smoothest, and his hollow fake log does have some rough bits.  "
325,How to tell if Mother cat is lactating?,How can I tell if my cat is producing milk for her newborn kittens?   My cat birthed 2 kittens on October 31st. One of them died yesterday morning. The other one has been crying a lot. I am concerned that the mother is not producing milk. How can I properly and accurately tell if she is producing milk or not?  I tried doing my research on the internet but did not find any truly conclusive answers. Mostly just heresay. I tried massaging and squeezing her nipples but nothing came out. Although I'm not convinced this means she's not producing milk as it might require suction to pull it out.  I also read to weigh the kitten twice a day and look for 5-10 grams of weight gain a day. I'm going to do this. But in the meantime I want to know if there is any direct way to know the mother is producing milk.  I started to go and buy milk replacement. But I would hate to ruin the natural feeding order and invest all that time into feeding the kitten if the mother is indeed making milk and I just cannot tell. 
326,German shepherd puppy digs holes in our carpet,"Can anybody tell me how to get our 7 month old purebred german shepherd female puppy to stop digging holes in our living room carpet?  She actually has dug and shredded in several spots down to the carpet pad. Its going to cost us around 5000.00 to replace the carpet now. She also digs holes outside, but we can live with that. We put poop in the holes outside but she just moves to a new spot.  We love her very much. We have several soft squeaky toys. Give her rawhide chews. Give her chicken jerky treats and dog bones. Lots of hugs and kisses and play time.  They have a huge fenced yard to play in. She has a sister that has never dug at all. They both have big soft beds inside and nice warm dog houses outside. We feed then twice a day plus keep dry avail. Throughout the day.  When they come inside she will be fine for about 30 minutes, but if we don't watch her 100% of the time she will sneak off and we will hear her start to dig and shred the carpet. By the time we jump up and go to her she can have a hole already started. We hate to have to tie her up in the house. Anyone have any suggestions?  "
327,2 month old kitten care,"Am caring for kittens that I found last night, that the mother seems to have abandoned, that I thought were one month old. Ideally I wanted her to come back to them. They were likely fathered by one of the outdoor cats belonging to my next door neighbor who says they are two months old. My husband found online that emergency food for four weeks or younger was egg yolks with a bit of vegetable oil. They loved it. Weather forecast predicted thunderstorms last night so after we fed them we put them in a Rubbermaid style tub with small fleece blankets, tall enough that they couldn't climb out, but large enough that the mom could jump in, and set them under our back porch which is just across the driveway from where his cats hang out. Multiple litters come from his cats every year and 90% of them die. One of this group of five did die hours after I found them. These four seem strong, though I am a little concerned about the apparent runt. Neighbor says he never considers them completely out of the woods until they're a year old. Now that I know they're older than four weeks, I see that they are old enough to eat kitten food. Is it best to start with wet food? Will the cans advise how much to feed? And should I feed the ""runt"" a little more than the others? Do they need kitten milk? And what should I feed them until I can get the canned food tomorrow? Stick with the egg yolks? Can I use the whole egg? Should I scramble them?(That would be less messy). And Should I put them back in the same place tonight? Or should I just give up on her. I could tell she didn't come to them last night. I will greatly appreciate any responses. Thank-you.  "
328,Dealing with situational jealousy,"I have two 2-year-old cats, one male, one female. They are siblings and both were fixed a long time ago. The male is very affectionate and frequently follows my girlfriend and I around the house hoping for some attention. If we sit down on the sofa, he usually jumps up to lie down next to us. The female is a more stereotypical cat: she enjoys some physical attention every once in a while, but is just as happy lying in a chair by herself.  My girlfriend and I try to give the cats equal attention, but I always ended up giving the male more because, well, he was usually at arm's length. My girlfriend has a bit less patience for him (he's really needy = annoying), though, and so gave more attention to the female than I did.   Now, I've actually left the house (doing a one-year MBA abroad), so my girlfriend is now taking care of the cats by herself. The female has now become significantly more affectionate, and the male isn't too happy about that. For the last couple of days, my girlfriend has reported that if she's lying in bed with the male and the female comes in looking for some affection, he bites her (the female). By my girlfriend's tone, the bites don't seem vicious, but are clearly a display of dominance. My girlfriend states that she has not noticed such behavior in other situations; only when the female is ""interrupting his affection-time"".  The reasons for his behavior are pretty clear. He got used to a certain (excessively high) level of attention when I was around, and now that I've left, he's feeling the difference and thinks his sister is taking up his affection-time. I can (and do) blame myself for failing to ween him off me properly before I left.  My question is what to do about this. I've seen a few other questions on this SE about how to deal with jealousy between new and old cats, or just two cats in general, but those all deal with conditions of overall jealousy, with cats attacking or sabotaging each other during the day. This, however, only happens in one specific circumstance.  So, what should my girlfriend do next time this happens? Should she give him a slight tap on the head and scold him? Should she put him in a separate room to cool off? My concern is that this may just worsen the issue, with the male associating his sister's entrance not only to him losing affection, but to even being punished. "
329,"Dog eats the cat food, Cat eats the dog food","I put down both dry and canned food, My dog (15 yrs old) eats the cat food, and my cat (6 months old) eats the dog food. They both eat both types of the others food. Why?? and is it doing any harm to them, and the food is in different locations. "
330,Can a hamster be allergic to cats?,"I live in an apartment with my Roborovski hamster, and my roommate has a cat. Occasionally the cat will get into my room and get close to him, and shortly after, I will notice him scratching himself a lot. Is it possible he might be allergic to it?  If this doesn't sound like the case, what does cause him to scratch so frequently?   "
331,what's the best way to serve olive oil to a constipated cat?,Read on the internet that olive oil is good for constipated cats. I was wondering what's the best way to give it to the cat as I am afraid of any side effects. Is it best with solid or wet food? Wouldn't wet food make the olive oil's effect less as it muddles with it? Can anything bad happen to my cat if I she eats olive oil with wet or dry food due to some chemicals in the cat food? And what's the best way to serve olive oil and keep it's effect at full limit?  She eats Friskies dry and wet food and Wiskas wet food. 
332,Betta fish is a dark blue but color keeps fading and returning quickly Why?,My Betta fish Sahpire is a female veiltail and she's dark blue normally but her color keeps fading and returning to normal in a short span of time and I don't know what to do. I already lost one to ich. Could it have to do with the water temperature? Should I change the water in her tank? 
333,Is it normal for a pregnant cat to have a hard stomach?,"My cat is almost due to delivery. We expect her to give delivery withen these days. Her tummy on each side (where I assume there is a kitten on each) is hard, is this normal?   Also the cat sets on bags in the middle of the hallway and takes the peeing possesion (legs seperated, tail up, moves her legs at first as if digging with them and then settles as if she is ready to pee) can I assume she is trying to give birth in the middle of the hallway? We have company living with us and she is not on good terms with them, can it be that she is a little stupid or doesn't have intuition enough to tell her that she should give birth in a hiding place?  We already provided her with two hiding places (which we can really reach her but never did so she thinks it's a hiding place) she was sitting in one of them the day before. Can it be that she likes the hidings but does not know she should hide once she's due to giving birth? "
334,What's the best way to preserve dry dog/cat food for long run?,I buy dry dog and cat food (kibble) in large bags to save money.  What's the best way to preserve it? Deep freeze it? 
335,Should I get the kitten which my friend wants to give separating from its mother?,"My friend wants to give away kittens in his house. He has already given 2 of them. I approached him to get the 3rd kitten but when I went to take the kitten,  it was licking and playing with its mother and also the mother cat was cuddling her. Seeing this I couldn't really make my mind to separate the 2 of them. The kitten is 6 weeks old. Should I try and go get it after a couple of weeks or just let it stay with its mom. Will the cat take care of kitten always? Or will both of them miss each other if they get separated? Enlighten me. "
336,Is it safe to get my cat on x ray machine?,"My vet advised having an x-ray taken of my cat's paw after she was stomped upon by my reckless neighbor who I am not speaking with anymore. She is always coming to drink my coffee and take my food but will not even watch for my dearest kitty when walking around.   Anyway, after talking with my vet we concluded that my cat should get an x-ray of her paw. Initially, I said yes and made an appointment to do it but later I started thinking about it and now I am worried if x-ray is safe for cats.  I know that x rays advanced over the course of years and that they are safe for humans but what about cats? I read on various places like here x ray for cats that it is generally considered safe and that pros far outweigh the cons.   Meaning what? It is safe but there are chances that it could hurt my cat?   If there are chances no matter how small I will be anxious to do this because the cat is walking without any problems.   However, I would like to hear some other opinions before asking my vet further about this as I am afraid that I am just over thinking this and making it worse than it is... Thank you everyone in advance for your replies! "
337,How long can a kitten be cat-sit before it affects her development / my relationship with her?,"I have a kitten; about 10-11 weeks old, who I rescued at around 8 weeks. I also have an adult cat, about 14 years old.  I have two unavoidable trips coming up. Next week I will be away for 6 days. In 6 weeks I will be away for nearly 3 weeks.   I am not worried about the adult cat. The kitten, however; I am extremely anxious about these trips; the long one more than the short. For both I have a cat-sitter who I trust and who has great experience with kittens.   I am also concerned because she'll be about 12 weeks for the first trip, and 16-19 weeks for the second. That's a lot of time to miss, and she's in some pretty critical development stages (and I'm putting a lot of care into raising her as best as I can).  So my question is: What kind of effect will these trips have on the kitten? How can I minimize any damage to her development and to her relationship with me? Am I worrying too much? They're basically my kids.  I socialize her with other humans but I am the only human living in this house. The cat sitter will be at my house, but will only be able to be here 2-3 hours/day (another thing I'm very concerned about). The kitten gets along well enough with the adult (the adult is a particularly patient and tolerant cat, although he does not enjoy play with the kitten so much, and the kitten is very active and unfortunately does not have a cat playmate).  I am trying to find ways to take the cats with me on the longer trip; but it's a significant expense (both money and time; basically it would involve an RV and a road trip instead of hotels and planes - yes... I am a crazy cat person) to set up a comfortable and constant environment for them if I take them with me. And besides, it may be best for the kitten if she stays in her home territory (I think?) -- I don't know if this would do more damage than harm. "
338,What's wrong with this kitten's eyes and how do I take care of them?,"I just found a shivering little stray kitten on the inside of air conditioned building and thought it must be feeling cold so I took out in the sun and then ended up just bringing it home.  Its eyes are weird and seem to be covered up with something. Please take a look at the image below.      Is it blind, or infected? I don't have easy access to a vet's place for now! So any cat-expert opinions? If it's an infection, is there any way to help it cure at its own pace, using honey maybe? (The way that honey helps cure cough/cold-type infections with humans too).  What should I do with this kitten? And it's really dirty but I'm afraid to give it a bath because it was shivering back in the building and if it has a cold I don't want it to die of it.  Update  I wasn't able to get to any vet immediately so I tried to heal her at home. And then she started improving. It turned out it really was a lot of dirt and a bad infection. I carefully patted it with a wet cloth and gently rubbed it off. But her eyes kept forming strands of pus and kept filling up quickly with it.   I searched online and found the following to be very effective:    Warm compress. Hold a warm washcloth against the eyes for 2-3 minutes. Honey-water saline solution. Mix a teaspoon of honey with a tablespoon of water. Then add a pinch of salt. Apparently if honey isn't available, milk can be used as a substitute, although not nearly as good. Anyway I used honey and the kitten's eyes got much better, she had longer periods of time without pus forming in her eyes. Then we found antibacterial eye drops and her eyes really cleaned up after that. Here's a close-up of her eyes after 5-6 days:     Sorry for the bad picture, it was clearer in real life but I'm not much good at taking photos.  So as you can see, she seemed fine! With her eyes alright, and her general physical health seeming to be improved (because she had started eating more and was taking calculated leaps around the house), I was planning to drop her back around the area where I found her, basically a few blocks down from my house.  But then tragedy struck... I don't know what went wrong. She didn't eat much one day, and when we checked on her the next morning, she was so exhausted and panting she couldn't hold her head up straight. We tried to get emergency contacts to the nearest vet. There was one, but office hours hadn't started yet. And she died before we could get there.   It was really sad. I don't know what went wrong. Someone in my family (not knowing that kittens are sensitive) put her in the shower for a couple of minutes the day before she died. But we dried her immediately after that and she seemed alright too, all fluffy and fine and sitting around with us.  Maybe she was already ill and suffering from something... Or can a kitten really die from a shower? "
339,Is PVA glue safe to use in my leopard gecko's enclosure?,"I'm building my gecko a new moist hide, since I didn't like the shop-bought ones very much. Without going into all the details, the lid consists of two thin, flat pieces of wood I have shaped and now need to fix together.  I don't have wood glue any more so I was thinking of using PVA glue to stick them. I would leave it for 24-48 hours to dry fully before putting it in the terrarium.   I know it's a relatively safe type of glue as it's the main type of children's glue. But I want to be sure before putting the glued wood in the terrarium. Are there any kind of fumes that could be given off (even after the glue has dried) in a warm terrarium?  What other alternatives are there? "
340,Positive reinforcement to diminish barking,"This is a question for my friend who has a (female) Chihuahua (8 years old) named Maple. She has a tendency to bark at pretty much every person who enters the house, even if it's family and friends.  Now I'm pretty sure I remember from my AP Psychology class in high school that reinforcing negative behavior with positive reinforcement will simply increase the likelihood of the negative behavior [severe lack of source] (and this is, of course, not desirable).  Backstory  We're about to move into a house together with 4 other people (6 total), and we have both agreed that we should try and train her (if possible) to only bark at strangers instead of every person that walks in the door. We don't know if she's barking out of fear of the person, anger that someone disturbed the atmosphere, or just generally because she wants to let us know that someone entered the house (friendly or not). We thought that maybe positive reinforcement would be a good idea, even going against basic psychological principles [still no source].  Edit: Maple is usually right next to the front door when she is barking, usually (but not always) accompanied by my friend (the owner). To get her to stop barking, he usually calls her into his room. She is never aggressive; she simply barks, hops back, barks again, hops back, etc. Sometimes she barks while dancing (not happy dancing) in circles around you. That said, she always barks, whether or not the owner is around (I have gone to his house while he is/isn't home and she always barks).  Goal  Train Maple not to bark at friends and family.  - This is technically a punishment, because we want the behavior to disappear.  Method   A friend or family member walks in the door; Maple starts to bark; We grab a small treat from a treat bowl near the door and give it to Maple (with lots of affection); Maple runs off happily to eat her treat.     What we don't want to do is punish her for barking. We don't want to use a spray bottle, we don't want to yell at her, etc. We believe that reinforcement is the way to go.  Theory  By giving Maple positive reinforcement (a treat), she will learn to like the friends/family and not feel the need to bark because she knows the person, and knows that she gets a treat when she sees them.  Fears  We have a sneaking suspicion that Maple will take the positive reinforcement as ""If I bark a lot when someone comes in, I get a treat!"", which would of course not be the desired behavior. Because we would be giving her a treat during a negative behavior that we want to correct, the reinforcement (treat) may increase the negative (barking) behavior.  Other Potential Problems   We all go broke from buying so many treats. Too many(?) treats may negatively affect Maple's health.  We could regulate this, of course. There are 6 people in the house, so treats may not be the best method if there are health repercussions.      Questions   Are there risks to this method of behavior training? Will Maple's age affect her ability to be behaviorally-trained? Is there a better way to go about correcting her barking behavior?  None of us know much about psychology nor animal training, so any help from either perspective would be much appreciated!   "
341,"Does ""redirect instead of correct"" really work for cats","I like ""redirect instead of correct"" because i find it agreeable. But i have a 15 week old kitten who i have had for 7 weeks and i have not had any success with this.   In all cases where i attempt to redirect (gently without scolding), the behavior ends up being repeated sooner or later. In the one case where i attempted to correct (with scolding) the behavior has never been repeated again.  For example there is a certain shelf my kitten cannot go on and is difficult to make safe for a kitten. It is in an odd place that she has to go out of her way to get to, and it took her a while to even discover it existed. Once she discovered it she keeps trying to go there. Every time i see her about to go back there i either a) distract her with a toy on the ground or b) pick her up and put here somewhere else. When i do a, once she is done with the toy she goes back. When i do b she immediately heads back to the spot. The more times this happens the faster she tries to run into the spot as if it is a game. This happens every day, multiple times, for about 4 weeks with zero progress. It has been a complete failure.  The counter example is when she tries to jump on my laptop keyboard while i am using it. The first few times this happened i picked her up and moved her elsewhere. Then she kept doing it with more ""passion"" so i raised my voice at her. Finally i just hissed at her and shoved her away with some force. She has never once repeated the action since and that was 3 weeks ago. It didnt change her behavior towards me otherwise, she didnt begin to fear me or anything, shes as sweet as ever and when she sits on my chest while im laying on the couch with my laptop she is very good, seems happy, and will even resist going after the mouse pointer. It has been a complete success.  In the example above with the shelf it doesn't appear as though she likes the attention; she usually meows in frustration when i pick her up when shes doing this, and if she happens to be on the shelf already when i pick her up she resists.  With redirect its as if the more i redirect the action, the more passion she puts in to trying to do it, as if im somehow enforcing the bad behavior despite giving her no praise after redirecting. Its as if redirecting only delays the inevitable bad behavior.  All advice i read recommends redirect instead of correct. My own judgment tells me that is the best way to train a pet as well. And it feels better than harsh scolding. I continue to try it, but i have 0% success with redirect and 100% success with scold / correct (although i have only done that once).   Does this training method actually work or is it a result of people not wanting to yell at their pets? How does a cat actually associate being redirected with ""dont do this any more""? What am i doing wrong? "
342,Is there any substrate for turtles that avoids the risks of impaction?,"I've been reading a lot about impaction in Reptiles. Various articles have suggested alternatives that prevent impaction in Reptiles, but they've all been about land Reptiles. So far all substrate I know of for turtles carry with them the possibility of impaction.  I do not feed my turtle in the aquarium, however I do sometime drop a carrot peel, which eventually sinks after being soaked. Sometimes I see my turtle scavenging for the carrot near the substrate and I fear that one day it swallows some. Even if their is no food in the tank, my turtle will still search for food.   Is their any specific kind of substrate that is fool proof against impaction? If not then what is the most appropriate substrate for a turtle? And if the risks of impaction are unavoidable then how much is the substrate actually important for turtles?  Update: I removed the substrate completely and put some rocks, as I saw my turtle eating one of the small rocks then spitting it out , I still suspect it might have ate some. I kind of feel it's having a harder time floating, I just hope it didn't and if it did it won't affect it and it'll just be excreted. "
343,Is it a problem to pet my kitten while she is eating?,"For purely selfish reasons I like to pet my ~10 wk old kitten while she's eating. I mean, she's really soft, and she just lets me give her the attention while she purrs and eats. How could I not??  Anyways, in all seriousness, is this OK or could she develop some sort of eating disorder or bad eating behavior from it?  Starting about a week and a half ago I feed her twice a day at specific times (rather than leaving the food out) and she is fine with this.  She does always run to start eating when I'm standing next to the food bowl, even if she was previously uninterested in the food, which I'm assuming is a result of me petting her but it seems harmless... I think.  There is an adult cat in the house as well who likes to eat her food, which could contribute to why she is excited to eat when I'm nearby (since I always stop him from stealing her food). "
344,Can I bathe my cat with shampoo?,I have a cat that's almost six months old and she really needs a bath. She's allowed to go outside so she sometimes comes back inside dirty.  Are there any problems relating to bathing her that I should know about? Do I need to use a special kind of shampoo when I bath her? 
345,What does becoming a canine good citizen allow me to do with my dog?,"My dog is taking a manners class which I hope will end with him becoming a canine good citizen. What does this designation enable me to do with my dog?  Are there public places that don't allow dogs, but will allow dogs that are canine good citizens?  Are there places where leash laws don't apply to canine good citizens? "
346,How can I encourage a kitten to poop for a stool sample?,"I always seem to have this problem.  My kitten has her second doctor's appointment coming up (second round of shots), and I still need to get them a stool sample for a checkup, preferably no older than 3 hours.   Murphy's law states that when a stool sample is required, a cat will not poop the morning of a doctor's appointment; except, of course, the one time the cat poops 10 minutes prior, in which case it states you will forget to grab it.  What can I do to encourage kitty to poop? Is there a type of food I can feed her ahead of time? Is there something I can do to encourage her to do her business in the hours before the appointment?  It's particularly important that I get a stool sample because her stool has not been tested yet (I adopted her a few weeks ago), and we do need to make sure she's off to a good start. "
347,Can I keep my cat from defecating in the carrier during transport?,"About 6 weeks ago, we adopted 2 senior cats.  While bringing them home, one of the cats defecated in her carrier.  Last night, I took them both to our vet for a checkup.  Each cat has their own carrier, and both rode in the front of the car with me.  I drove back roads as much as possible, and did my best to avoid sudden stops and acceleration.    The ride to the veterinarian's office is much shorter than the ride from the pet food store we rescued them from, and I was pleased to see that we made it without another incident.  However, on the way home after the appointment, she defecated again (I suspect shortly before we arrived at home, as I did not smell it until I went to pick her up).  Clearly both cats were very stressed by the car ride, but so far 2 out of 3 short trips have resulted in the 13 year old female making a mess.  Are there any strategies for minimizing this?  The obvious solution would be to only take her right after she uses the litter, but since we have to schedule our appointments weeks ahead of time, and the time of the appointments largely depends on the doctor's availability and my work schedule, I'm not sure how practical that would be.  Are there other strategies that might help? "
348,Do the colors of a cat's coat correlate with its personality?,"I've heard some people say that a cat's coat color says a lot about its personality. I think it's fairly common to think that tortoiseshell cats have attitudes (""tortietudes""). Is this urban legend, or is there any truth to this?  I found a study that seems to suggest that it's people's perceptions of the colors that leads them to believe that they're related.  So what makes people say that a cat's coat color is an indicator of it's personality? Is it there some truth to it, just peoples perceptions, or maybe even just an urban legend? "
349,How can I train a full-grown untrained dog to stop eating garbage?,"He's an 8-year-old beagle. I am his secondary owner of 6 months - his primary owner has owned him since puppyhood. Apparently there have been failed attempts to give him some basic training in the past, most notably enrollment in doggy discipline school. (They gave a refund and expressed that he was not welcome back after the first day of training.)  I have started to read up on books and resources for training dogs as I feel he does need some basic training and I have come to understand that he has been unwittingly trained to lunge at garbage, put it in his mouth and swallow it as quickly as possible. He eats other animals' poop, any and all food he finds on the ground, sticks his snout into garbage and plastic bags at the slightest opportunity.   He has had very little training and little if any understanding of command words. I want to get started right away on correcting the garbage eating behavior as I am concerned he will eventually eat something that does something horrible to him. It is difficult to avoid garbage on the ground as we live in a city area that is extremely littered. (Even the parks have food garbage lying around from picnics.) I don't want to stop taking him on walks while I study basic training principles and canine communication - we are currently living in an apartment building and he has the run of the veranda, but that's not enough space for him is it?  Is it possible to start training him to stop eating everything he can reach in these circumstances? How might I go about it? "
350,Can dogs have cat allergy?,"I know cat allergy is quite common in human beings, how about dogs ? Will dogs also suffer from cat allergy? "
351,Cat is hitting object when trying to jump on it,"So about a month ago our cat managed to fall out of the window onto our balcony. -> 2nd floor to 1st floor.  It was at night so we didn't see exactly what happened, only heard the noise when he landed.  Sounded like he hit our garden chairs which where standing there folded together.  As soon as we opened the door to the balcony he ran in, up the stairs and was hiding under the bed. I then slowly pulled him towards me and we checked if he was in pain somewhere (touched all feet and everything).  But he seemed alright except that he lost the fur on his nose. Looked like he hit some sharp edge and his fur was literally was shaved off. He was also bleeding a bit but nothing dramatic.  It wasn't running freely - just a bit of blood on the wound.  He then calmed down very quickly and was acting quite normal again so we decided not to go to a vet. (It was a Saturday night I believe).  Since the incident I have the impression that he often can't manage to jump up on objects. He tries but instead of jumping on them he jumps against them. Sometimes he nearly makes it and other times he's not even close to getting up. On the other hand there are times he jumps up without a problem.   Can it be that he is just more 'careful' or just has more fear of jumping over the object?  I believe the day he fell out the window that he tried to jump on the windowsill and was just to fast so he didn't manage to stop and then fell down.  So the specific question would be:  Is it just that 'the shock is still in his bones' or are his 'senses' somewhat 'damaged' and in fact of that he can't aim that accurately anymore?  "

353,Do Achatinas appreciate communication with human?,"Do Achatinas appreciate communication with human, or is it just a stress to them?  When you take them in your arms, they seem to move more actively then in the terrarium, but do they appreciate that, is it good for their health?  As they are cold blooded, they should like a source of warmth such as human hand in theory. I know of a pet lizard which likes to stay on one's knees, as it is seemingly warm for him and he needs to warm up his body as it's cold blooded, ignoring communication at the same time. Is it the same with snails? "

355,Older cat doesn't come home since new cat is here,"I'm starting by a short flashback about one year.  My girlfriend, me and our 2 tomcats (Elliot(4) and Fridolin(2)) where living in a flat share at an old farmyard (Inside a small ville), together with 4 other people. There had been a catflap and both of them could get in and out as they want to.  Sadly, Fridolin got overrun by a car, needles to mention the emotional situation.  Due we had plans moving together in our own flat (no shared flat anymore), we did not got a new cat and Elliot had been alone for some (circa 6) months.  Then, in March, we moved. Elliot adapted really quick to the new environment. We where able to let him out after 2 weeks, and he came back without any issue.  We have one window open almost all the time, and he can get in and out as inured. (He already learned what to do when it's closed, walking to any other window in hope we see him.). But as the months passed by, we noticed a change in Elliots behavior we don't like.   He became slack, doing nothing but sleep and cuddling a little. Sometimes he got out, like 20-30 minutes, came back with a mouse (he always ate himself, no presents) and sleeps again.  We thought, it's the time for a new cat and arount 10.August 15, the little female cat Pebbles(12 weeks at that time) came to us. She is a very active, even for her young age (I've seen plenty young cats, sure they're active in general but Pebbles is of her own kind.)  First contact between Elliot and Pebbles had been through the window.  He was sitting outsite at the windowsill, while she sat inside, right at the place where his bowl stands. One easily could notice the consternation in Elliots face.  We let him in, and the little rubberball Pebbles had seemingly annoyed him a lot.   In the first days, Elliot avoidet contact with Pebbles. When she where coming to close, he hissed at her and left. He never attacked her and even if she attacked(play) him, he only pushed her back, without claws.  The next weeks, he came home lesser and less.  Now we know, he spends the whole day sitting at neighbors porch, no matter what weather. He feeds him self by catching mice (he does really well) and is almost unactractable by goodies.  Sometimes, he comes home and seemingly is hungry, like he couldn't catch enough mice that day. He eats the whole bowl at once, which usualy is enough for a whole day, and leafes again. In the short span he is at home, he growls constantly, even if Pebbles isn't in sight (smell?). He also started hissing at us, if we come to close. But this aggression doesn't point to us. When outside, he behaves like nothing happens, enyoing beeing stroked. Outside, he is happy as before. It seems, as he really hates the environment and want to get out asap.  This state is now since about 3 weeks. He didn't lost weight, all neighbors decline to feed him.  We are at the point where Pebbles has to go, we already have a trustworthy person who would take her. But how can we know, if Elliot will come home again? We are catpeople, ending up with no cat at all would be the end of the world.  Are there any strategies we could try to solve the problem? "
356,Why did all 45 goldfish (and 2 mosquitos) in my 1600 gallon pond suddenly/overnight begin a 4-day die-off?,"Am very frustrated: My 45 or so goldfish and several mosquito fish were so happy. Then literally overnight they stopped eating and within days died off.   The day the trouble started the outside temperature soared to 95 but the water seemed cool enough. Moreover, the center of the pond is 4 feet deep.  In happier days whenever I’d feed them they would snap and race around their pond. The pond is an in-ground hot tub covered with a non-toxic triple liner designed for fish that cost me $300. We live in Pasadena, CA where the weather is generally moderate.  The goldfish were rescue fish destined to be eaten by Pet Smart customers’ carnivores. So they were at least spared whatever terror was in store for them.   After they started to die off, I changed almost all of the water but not all because there were some fry I was attempting to save. In hindsight I wish I had gone 100%.  I repeatedly tested the water with a kit and also at PetSmart. Then I put some new goldfish in—all of which died within days. The water was hard so I added the proper amount of salts. The ph was around 7.   The nitrite level was borderline stressful, so I added a bottle of stress coat. Still no luck.. All other readings (ammonia, etc. were normal).  I had made a filter using bio balls and ran a small pump constantly with ok aeration. Admittedly it could have been better, as the balls never really looked that dirty. Moreover, because a raccoon had punctured the liner, only 3 months earlier I had completely drained the pond and did with no lose of fish.  After the disaster struck and following the water exchange, I built a massive filter and added a heavy duty pump that made the water crystal-clear—but it was too late. Another batch of new fish died.  After draining the pond, I realized too late that some of the fish that died had sunk to the bottom and possibly continued to contaminate.  Half the pond’s surface was covered with 2 types of water lettuce. I have now 100% drained the pond and have discarded the lettuce for fear that it is contaminated. Could the lettuce have caused the problem?   Raccoons were always trying to get the fish but didn’t seemed to have any success. Could they have introduced a disease?  Maybe there was a fish-borne disease? But no new fish had been introduced for months. "
357,"My dog will not eat unless handfed, one at a time","I am concerned because my dog will not eat her food unless I handfeed one at a time. I left the food in the bowl and she sniffed it and walked away(she did this a few times over a period of 10 minutes). I tried leaving it on the floor and she did the same thing. I sat down, hoping my presence would change something, but she just sat next to me. So I called her over and started feeding her the kibble one at a time, which worked. Halfway through, I put all the kibble in my hand, hoping she would eat, but she immediately stopped eating, so I resumed handfeeding(with my fingertips). When there were only a few kibble left, I tried putting them all in my hand again, but she stopped eating and walked away after sniffing. I put them all down and (walked to her) gave her one, but she actually spit it out. Then I called her over to me instead and fed her the last few.   I haven't noticed any atypical behavior (e.g. lying in a corner, taking no interest in anything). She did this at her 1st and 2nd meals today(havent given her 3rd) and in between she was running around excitedly and playing with her toys. She isn't napping any more than she usually does. She is also still barking at the door when she hears things. As for her behavior towards food: she ALWAYS seems to want food and this is the first time I have seen her exhibit nonchalance towards food or any mention of it. However, when I was eating food today, she was still interested in it. I've heard advice from a dog trainer(given to another dog) who said to not be concerned if their dog was not eating because he was a big dog and probably wasn't hungry, but my dog is a small breed.  I am not sure what to do because this seems very atypical although her other behaviors have not changed. What should I do to resolve this? Could it be something to do with the food or bowl? I haven't changed anything in the last few days and she always appreciated her food before. Should I take her to the vet?   Edit: she is 10 months old "
358,What effect do loud drums have on cats' hearing?,"I have two 15-year-old black cats. They're the most timid little things ever. My brother plays his acoustic drum set at least once a week, and the loudness is incredible no matter where I go in the house.  When he's playing and I'm around my cats, I like to think I can tell there are some adverse effects the loudness has on them and their hearing. They seem jumpy and wide-eyed. Note that acoustic drums in a house that doesn't have a lot of big open spaces (hallways, stairwells, etc.) can create piercing noises that are rough even on my ears.  So can any of this hurt or damage my cats' hearing? Are there any other effects this might have on my cats? "
359,How can I stop my cat from clawing at my door?,"My one-year-old cat is constantly clawing at my bedroom door. I have many scratching posts' around my home but she still seems to come right back to my bedroom door to claw/scratch my door. The paint on my door is horrible at this point. I've tryed adding clear tap to fix the peeling paint that is coming off, but that doesn't work because she will continue to claw that off as well.  Does she think my door is also a scratching post? Isn't there a difference of feeling?  "
360,Are eggs (raw or cooked) and bananas acceptable as treats/emergency meals for dogs?,"When I run out of dog food my go-to is raw eggs/bananas because they're always in the house. Those are also my Pug's favorite food/treats. If I train her to do something new, or she's showing good discipline, I'll reward her with either. She has raw eggs every couple months and bananas as treats a couple times a month max. Is this hurting her? "
361,My adult cat kneads and sucks on my blanket like a kitten. Why?,"I have seen this behavior in kittens before who are nursing with the mother. They push and pull on the mother's fur with their paws to get the milk. My cat, however, is a adult and has no mother. She does this while purring loudly and it seems to make her happy. Is this is memory that she is re-enacting? Is it a self-soothing behavior? I know little about her before I found her and her siblings abandoned, seven years ago. She was very hungry back then. "
362,Do old dogs run away to die?,"I asked this question on  but haven't received an answer, so I thought I would try here also.  My dog passed away a few days ago. He ran away from home early in the morning, and by the time we found him it was late afternoon and he was very weak, on the brink of death. Soon after we brought him home, he drifted off and stopped breathing.  I was feeling very horrible thinking about what might have happened to him in the hours before we found him, and that he might still be alive if we had somehow stopped him from running away. But a few people comforted me, saying that a lot of old dogs run away from home when its time to die. Perhaps they like to die alone?   I'm wondering if there's any truth to this?

364,Removing Chemicals from plastic aquarium,"I have a 1.5 gallon acrylic aquarium which I recently made the mistake of cleaning with a blue scotchbrite sponge (dumb idea, I know, but I didn't realize that the sponges contained harmful chemicals at the time). Now I'm trying to undo what I did and remove all traces of harmful chemicals from the tank. I was told on another forum that acrylic tanks were more likely to retain chemicals because they're more porous than glass. What should I do? Would soaking the tank in vinegar help? If so, how should I do that (what concentration and for how long)? Any other suggestions? I've already rinsed my tank pretty thoroughly and am currently soaking it in water and Bettasafe, which is supposed to remove heavy metals. I have no fish in the tank at the moment. Thanks for any help!  "
365,Keeping tools clean with clumping cat litter,"We use clumping cat litter for our cat toilets. The problem is that that stuff clumps so well that it will also stick to the scoop and the edges of the litter tray, and is really hard to remove. Is there anything I can do to prevent that? Not sure if this is a terrible idea, but I was wondering if I could spray them with a little cooking oil, but I'm afraid that would diminish the quality of the cat litter and/or irritate the cats? "
366,Springer spaniel short term lameness after high intensity workout,"I have a 8 month old working line  springer spaniel bitch.  Recently I have noticed that while playing fetch she seems to suddenly become totally lame in the same back leg for about 2 or 3 minutes, then appears to walk it off and be fine again.   I originally thought just a pulled muscle or cramp from sprinting after the ball and turning quickly to jump/fall and grab it. However it keeps happening to the same leg which makes me think maybe it's something more?  Has anyone had any experience of this or advice?  Obviously you hear horror stories of early arthritis or hip dysplasia (her parents have good hd scores though) but I'm thinking maybe something like panosteitis given her age? I also think she might be about to get her first season, not sure if that's got any relevance but including in case.  Thanks  "

368,Boyfriend's dog peed on me,"So my boyfriend has an almost ten-year-old pom/Yorkie dog. Before moving in with him he did tell me that she didn’t really like females but she seemed to like me.   Well, when he lived with another girl the dog was potty trained and has been her whole life. He told me he never really had to train her. She just used to let him know when she needed to go out and she's using a pee pad if no one was there to let her out.  When he started living alone and going to work he’d leave the dog with his mom and then according to him he doesn’t know when she started peeing in the house. She just kind of started and (in his words) “I guess she just thought it was the new normal to soil the house” because no one stopped her or got onto her.   We are about to move into an apartment with carpets and I told him I want her potty trained before we move in. He says he can’t potty train her because he’s at work but he refuses to let me get on to her when she soils the house he wants me to just leave her alone and let her do her thing.   Me and her have never had a problem and I give her pets and love all the time. She just kind of ignores that I exist like if I call her she just ignores me and even when I pet her I feel like she’s just ignoring that I’m there she won’t even play with me.   I decided I was going to potty train her anyways. I started getting onto her this week when she would soil the house and I try to get her to go outside.   Well this morning I wake up about 3 am because I feel wetness under my side I get up and she peed on the bed all the way down from my waist to my feet. The mark she made clearly showed the puddle where she started and then the line going down the blanket (where I was laying) where she was walking while she peed and the small puddle at my feet where the pee line ended.  I was so ticked I woke him up and told him the dog peed on me and he insists that she didn't do it on purpose and that she just must have really needed to pee (yeah I’m not buying that). And then he stated that there’s no way she did it on purpose because she never did anything to the other girl and she hated her.   On top of this, she won’t do her business outside unless my boyfriend is here. If I take her out she tries to leave the property instead of doing her business. When I asked him why she tries to leave he said that she’s trying to go find him and that she will do that if she is taken outside while he’s not there.    But I noticed she is very sneaky about soiling the house. For example, there have been a few times where the dog will be laying in the same room as me and I will change the babies diaper and I notice she will leave the room. I try to be quick with the baby but by the time I’m done the dog has already come back to the room and sure enough, she’s left a mess in the house. Or when I go to use the bathroom or get something to eat I will come back to a mess.   So I guess my question is did the dog pee on me out of anger or was it an honest old dog accident or other things that could be wrong with it? And if it was anger how do I make it stop before it’s another problem? And how can I potty train this dog or is her refusal to go outside just her age? "

Now, with the lack of competition, they're trying to claim dominance over each other.   If your think the aggression is caused by something else, please mention in your answer  They can be near each other without fighting, however it's common for them to be chasing each other.  Small scratches have been seen on both cats, including on the nose. Fearless seems to be the one chasing.  However, Fatty seems to be winning the fights, as Fearless tends to have more visible scratches, especially on his nose. "
370,Saving fish from ick/ich,"I have ciclids and guppies and African frogs in a 30gal tank. I'm new to this and didn't realize I was supposed to quarantine new fish before introducing them. I introduced a ciclid with ich without knowing it. Now my other ciclids have ich.  I've read that a combination of ick medicine and heat (84F) can solve ich.   1) Can these fish and frogs survive 84F? In general, which common fish can't survive 84F? I assume I just heat it up slowly.  2) Should I treat the 30gal tank, or transfer the fish to a smaller tank (filled with water from the larger tank) and treat them there?  3) In future during quarantine before introducing a new fish, do I just monitor it? Or can I put a small chemical cocktail (like some ich medicine) in the water for a few days to kill any bugs? If the latter, what chemicals/medicines do you recommend?  Thanks! "
371,Cat eating sweet things,"I've read several times now that cat's can't taste 'sweet' because they don't have the appropriate taste buds.  However, one of ours seems to love sweet things - whenever we have cakes, biscuits etc she will be rubbing up against us or sniffing round hoping to find some crumbs she can eat. We're always careful to keep anything with Chocolate or raisins away from her as we know they're bad, but is there any problem with a few crumbs?  If it's not the sugar, is there something else in cakes and biscuits/cookies that she's attracted to? "
372,How much land required to not poop scoop for avg sized dog,"I am hoping to eventually buy some land (at least 4 acres) outside the city, and I plan on adopting a bunch of ""undesirable"" (seniors, ""bad"" breeds, ugly, unfriendly, etc) dogs. They would be indoor pets, but I would have a doggy door for them to come and go as they please when I am not at home.  Obviously I would likely poop scoop close to the house, but I don't want to have to worry about most of the property.  What is the minimum amount of land I would need for 1 average sized dog, to not have to poop scoop? Is half an acre (roughly 1/3 of an NFL field) per dog enough?  A few sub-questions:   How would your answer change if the land was forested vs if it was dirt or grass? What about climate? I live in northern Virginia; we have ""normal"" seasons. Would their diet change the equation?   Note: Ignore any laws you might know of regarding poop scooping, or any environmental impact from poop. You can assume I will follow all local laws, yadda yadda yadda... "
373,Cat euthanasia. Kidneys shut down,"My beautiful cat Kisses was with me for 10 years. She was probably 12ish. I found her outside when she was a young adult.   On Monday she was diagnosed with renal disease. She had thrown up 20 times the night before I took her to the vet. They ran lab tests and gave IV fluid for 3 days. Her creatnine levels and bun both went down and she started to eat very small amounts but it was at least something. I gave subcutaneous fluids at home for 2 days along with a plethora of medications.   Yesterday, not even a week after diagnosis, she didn't eat or drink at all. She hid under the bed and didn't move much. I was going to take her to the vet once they opened. I kept checking on her and she seemed okay, still hiding under the bed, but not in distress. Then 30 minutes before I went to take her to the vet I went to check on her again. She had moved to a dark corner in the closet. She was breathing fast. 70-120x a minute. She barely had any strength but would stand if I made her and take a few steps and lay down.   I rushed her to the vet before they even opened. Her body temp was 97.1. The vet (of 36 years) recommended euthanasia. She thinks maybe her heart was failing. I told her I'd do anything to save her. She said I could take her to a 24 hr emergency vet and have mute testing but she thought anything I would do was futile. I made the roughest decision in my life to let her go peacefully.   Has anyone ever had this experience with a cat going so fast? I mean she was healthy and then diagnosed with Chronic Kidney Disease and then less than a week she was in real bad shape. Did I make the right decision? I feel terrible guilt. She is my soulmate. "
374,Why did my gecko die?,"So, about a month ago my gecko of three years died i'm still devasted to this day..It was a heart breaking moment...she was not eating at all nor drinking my dad said she was laying her infertile eggs so I relaxed a bit (my dad talked to a vet) and her stomach started to swell a lot she had dead skin stuck to her hands which made her put her arms a weird way when she slept. She also started to not move at all, all she ever did was sleep and it started concerning me. She had lip and eye infections. Her name was Plinxton. We were going to take her to the vet but sadly the night before we were going to...she passed away I know y'all are going to say ""how do you know she was dead?"" well, for starters she wasn't breathing anymore. She was even limper than what she was. She had no heart beat. Lastly she was pale. She was in so much pain she couldn't lift her lower part of her body. I miss her soo much. Does anyone of you know what my gecko had? please and thank you for reading this.. "
375,Why is my cat hissing and growling at his sister after just 30 minutes of separation,"I took my cat to the vet for 30 minutes. When I got her back home, her brother started to hiss on her and he looks aggressive. she tried to touch his nose but he still doesn't like it.    Should I leave them alone? Can they resolve the problem?  What is causing that problem? do you have an idea? Is it maybe the perfume of the vet? or he doesn't recognise that smell?  "
376,Would a small amount of bottled water mixed in with an aquarium harm the fish?,"This is kind of urgent - I'm watching someone's dogs currently because that is what I am experienced in but they also have an aquarium. I have little to know experience with fish and I did warn the owners. I don't have 100% of the information, a lot of it is guesswork but I really need help.   In order to feed the fish, I dissolve krill in ice into a cup of water and distribute it. I feel so dumb, but for the first 4 or so meals, I used about 3 cups of Crystal Springs water from a water cooler to feed them. I'd say this tank is a little smaller than 125 gallons and I'm fairly sure it's saltwater because of the breeds of fish. Since then, I've fed them about 4 or 5 times just using the tank water (I feel bad for not realizing that at first, I know virtually nothing about caring for fish).  The owners come back in about 5 days, is there anything I can do to fix this? How harmful will this be to the fish? I've already noticed the gravel is dirtier than before. I also haven't been able to contact the owners because they have no cell connection where they have traveled to. Any advice would be greatly appreciated "
377,Taking care of a dog in Germany,"In early November I'll be moving from Brazil to Stuttgart (Germany) because I've found a job there. All the documentation has already been taken care of and the dog will be allowed to enter the EU in November 2. Also, I'm already aware that it will be kinda hard to find an apartment to rent with a dog, even a small and quiet one as my 1 year old 5.5kg Shih Tzu.  I've been told that Germans tend to be very annoyoed by the smallest amount of barks, and I fully understand that. But I've been told that Germans find it ""almost criminal"" to leave a dog 8 hours a day alone at home. As I'll be working from 9 to 5, that's what will be happening. Is this going to be an issue, considering that the dog is well used to this, because it already happens here in Brazil? I mean, do neighbors really care about how much time my dog spents alone at home as long as he doesn't bark? "
378,Is my horse too cold?,This is my first horse and he is an Appendix (thoroughbred/quarter horse cross). He has a long slim athletic build much like a thoroughbred. I came out to feed him this morning and he was shivering horribly. I stalled him for the morning to dry off by I have questions. I've decided to put him on grain to add some weight to him since his skinny build doesn't seem to provide much warmth. I bought him a blanket but when is it appropriate to take it off/keep it on? Should I stall him at night and turn him out for the day as the temp drops? And what grain do you suggest? 
379,Is this cat safe of inbreeding?,"I would like to buy a cat (my first one) and I checked her for inbreeding and here are it's parents - [website]My question is, is it safe? Because with 4 generations there is 0% and with 5th generation 2.34% and then continue to raise.  Thanks for replies, David "
380,My cat is hiding and won't move,"My cat, Max, has been hiding under my grandma's steps since the 27th of september. We had to drop off all of my cats at my grandmas temporarily so we can move into another house. We didn't want them there when we were bringing in our items in case they walked out the door when we weren't watching.   They have never gone to my grandmas house before. Two of my cats were fine, one was very cautious and alert while Max was just petrified. Max has moved before, it shouldn't be new to him. He didn't move out of his carrier, so we had to pick it up and literally dump him out. This wasn't easy because of his size.   We had to leave, so we left the cats in the basement thinking they would come upstairs eventually. We first put them in the basement so we could show them the litter boxes.   The next time we came, which was yesterday, we were ready to take them to the new house. We got three of my cats in their carriers easily, while Max didn't budge from under the stairs. He wedged himself under the very last step. We thought he was stuck, but he wasn't. Eventually, we pushed him out and blocked the bottom steps with shoe boxes so he couldn't get trapped there and we could grab him.   He moved to the side of the steps wedged between the wall and the steps. He sat up so his head was actually between wall and stair.   We gave up after about an hour of trying to get him out and put him in his carrier.   He hasn't been coming out to eat or drink. We are even giving him wet food in his bowl to try to get him out. The only time he MIGHT be coming out is to go to the bathroom because there is no pee or anything by his hiding spot.   Today we found him a little ways away from the stairs under some headboards and other junk. How can we get him to warm up to us again so we can take him to a new home? I know moving can be stressful for a cat, but is this normal? The fact that he isn't eating really worries me.   Max is a male orange tabby and weighs around 20 pounds. We have never seen him like this. He acts like the head of the house usually, we didn't expect him to hide like this.   Ever since we found him by the stairs we've been trying to push him out. I stupidly tried to pull him with my hands and he bit me. Not a warning bite, but a real bite. He is just an animal, and it worries me that he thinks we would put him in danger.   Help? "
381,My 16 year old red eared slider hasn't laid eggs in years,"Shes been acting crazy, trying to get out of her tank and being a picky eater. I just started reading about her symptoms and discovered that she could be eggbound. Until now, I had no idea that this was even a possibility.  When I first got her Google wasn't a thing, I just bought books about red eared sliders and felt pretty confident and competent. Shes never even seen a vet before, shes always had a healthy appetite, sleep patterns. Never felt the need to take her. Have I been neglecting her for 16 YEARS?! When I got her, I literally took her off of a tweakers porch. They had her in a cut off gallon jug outside in December. She was about the size of a 50 cent piece and now she's 11 inches long.  She has laid eggs in the past, in her tank, and she has always eaten them. Please help! I feel so bad, do turtles have changes in hormones like menopause? I just assumed she outgrew it and now I'm freaking out! Is she egg bound? She hasn't laid eggs in years. Do turtles become infertile with age like women do? "
382,Shivering dog: Anxiety Vest or some other method?,"TL;DR: Are anxiety vests effective for dogs?  What else can I do to make my dogs anxiety go away?    I have a nearly 12 year old male Boston Terrier.  The dog is my girlfriend's.  Shes had him for almost 8 years.  According to her, his previous owner had to leave him at an adoption center for personal reasons (twice!), before giving him to my girlfriend.  I believe that because of this, and since she has owned him for 8 years now, he has grown very attached to her.    Whenever she goes to work and I am home with the dog, he shivers constantly.  He will not play with toys, he usually refuses to eat and drink water (sometimes he will), and just looks unhappy.  I'm fairly confident that he is experiencing some form of separation anxiety.  As soon as my girlfriend comes home, he races to see her and will either grab a toy to play with or scarf down his food and water that have been in his bowl all day.    The only methods I've found to control his shivering are laying on the couch with him, or putting him in his cage where he usually falls asleep.  I don't like having to put him away in his cage since I am home (we only like to use the cage when we aren't home or are sleeping), and I don't want to sit on the couch all day.  I was wondering, how effective are those anxiety vest that they make for dogs?  Are they a gimmick or do they really work?  I find it hard to believe that wearing a piece of clothing can sooth a dogs anxiety.    I should also note, he has the same behavior during a thunderstorm, or around the 4th of July with all the fireworks.  Would the vest be effective for this as well?  "
383,Should I move my sick fish to a clean tank for treatment?,"My fish (all three) have ick, they currently live in a 33g tank. The fish are two platys and 1 catfish (he's small). I have a spare 10g tank that only has gravel and water in it.  It would be easier to medicate in that tank and keep it clean (I don't have to change as much water volume wise, etc). So I was wondering if it's wise to move them? Or would the stress do them more harm than good? I also cannot use full doses in the current tank because there are snails and I don't want to kill them accidentally. "
384,New cats: Female intimidating/bullying her brother,"My Wife and I recently (two and a half weeks ago) adopted two cats, a brother and sister around 7 years old, from our local shelter. On the first day, the brother was more confident, but then became very timid, and he keeps hiding behind the sofa and under tables. His sister, on the other hand, has been much more outgoing.   At first we thought this was just him being scared of the new environment, but recently we've noticed that she seems to be intimidating him - she'll come and push in if we are giving him attention, and she eats from his food bowl while he just sits and watches. In the last couple of days she's also tried to claim his favourite sleeping position (the back of the sofa), which would give her control of almost all the high-up places - she already has a cat-tree and the lounge window-sill.   What can we do to dissuade this behaviour? We're particularly worried about him eating properly, if she keeps stopping him, and we want him to be able to be more confident around the house and around us, e.g. being comfortable to sit on our laps without her interfering. - ideally we'd like them comfortable enough with each other being close enough that we can have one on each of our laps!  They are not yet allowed outside (it's only been just over two weeks), though we have, in the last few days, given them access to more of the house (hall/landing/stairs as well as the lounge and kitchen), and he's taken to sitting at the top of the stairs (claiming a new high-place?)  They currently have two litter-boxes, which, as far as we can tell, both appear to use. They have separate food bowls, but currently they are in the same corner of the kitchen. We have a three-level cat tree, and a separate scratching post (which he tends to use). We feed them wet food in the evening and dry in the morning, and he tends to eat more of the dry - she'll wolf down her portion of the wet food while he looks on from a few feet away, then move over and eat his...

385,stray cats under the deck,"so we recently found out that we have a problem, we have a little group of cats in our neighberhood and they have settled themselves in under our deck. Theire are three cats and they wont leave from under our deck and my cats dont like going outside anymore,  ( we used to leave the food outside for my two cats because they used to wander all day but know we keep it inside because of the  strays, but even k now they wont leave  they are fed by the neighbors down the street so I know they arent starving  Does anyone know how to get rid of them so my cats would outside again??

386,socializing a puppy without all of the vaccinations,"I have a 10 week old puppy, but since she is too young she doesnt have all her shots should I wait till shes 16 weeks to introduce her to new puppies or should i just introduce her to adult dogs with all theire shots?? "
387,Unusual Aggression with Other Dogs,"I have an 8 month old cattle dog who recently has shown aggression towards other dogs at different times. He goes to daycare with groups of dogs, every Friday from 7am to 7pm and does great! He meets new and different dogs every time and never a problem or sign of aggression. However, when I take him on a hike or to the pond and he sees another dog, he gets very aggressive. It used to just be a quick growl and stare, then it escalated to sniffing the other dog and snapping towards its face. We went to Tractor Supply on Sunday and lab walked down another aisle (not near us, but within sight) and as soon as Axle saw him, he showed his teeth, growled and lunged towards the dog. Not in a playful manner. Is he resource guarding me? How can I teach him that other dogs are ok outside of his daycare setting? "
388,My dog is too quiet,"Actually it is my boyfriend's dog.  The first time I saw her, she was very exited and jumped into my body.  A year later when she came to my place, she was at first very exited too, I could see by her tail curving up.  But moments after she become very quiet, never barked, and did not respond when we called her.  Note that my boyfriend comes home less often since he got his new job, because he stays over at my place.  His dog stay at home with his brother and he rarely play with her.  Is that the reason my dog seems to be depressed?  One day I tried to pinch her ear, and she did not even responded when I hurt her.  Normally a dog will cry out when you accidentally hurt it.  What is happening to her?  Also, she becomes over exited and can't control her behavior when I walk her, often chasing strangers and other dogs. "
389,How to fix kitten's messy toileting,My 10 week old kitten Fluffy has problems going to the toilet. She is very messy and hard to clean up after. Is this normal? How can I minimise the mess? Should I get a self cleaning litter tray? 
390,Is there a breed of owl that makes a good pet,"Very much as the question says, is there a breed of owl that does well in a household environment?  The barn owl trust says that barn owls don't make good pets, but is there a breed that does, and what sort of environment should they be provided with? "
391,Can I get a dog - and which breed; from where?,"I want a dog. Very much. But:  Background:   I am going to finish my university studies next year and then start a well enough paying job to maintain a pet. I will probably have to work more than 8 hrs a day.  My girlfriend studies medicine and will have even worse hrs. at random times. (Nightshift, etc.) We want kids eventually. My mother is alergic to animal hair (or whatever, thats what she says, anyways, shes alergic to sth. but I heard there are dogs that don't trigger allergies) (She doesn't live with us, but I'd like to take the dog with me when visiting, maybe they can take care of the dog on holidays, etc.) It should be a dog bigger than a Football but smaller than a Pony.    My question is, with this background, is getting a dog in the next years realistic? And what breeds (or mutts) should we prefer?  I guess a puppy is not the best idea, a well trained dog would imho be a better fit. But what should I keep in mind, where can I get such a dog complying with my rather high ethical standards on this matter (you know, let's just assume animal activist standards or slightly below).  I'll edit in answers to questions in the comments if need be. Thx!    Thanks for the helpful answers and comments so far. Would getting two dgs really be a solution to leaving the dog(s) at home? And how much time at home alone is ""too much"" time? "
392,Do cats commit incest?,"Do cats commit incest? If so, at what age would this behavior begin, and when should male and female kittens be separated from one another so as to avoid incest? "
393,How to teach a cat to go outside without being loud?,"Ok what I mean by this is, I have a bengal cat that we used to take outside once in a while on a leash in our backyard. But he got so bad that he was yowling all the time, mostly at night when everyone went to bed. We stopped taking him outside and he stopped meowing so much, he's been sooo good lately and i dont really want to risk that. But, if i was to try and do this again on like a schedule, once a day or something, how would I teach him not to demand to go out all the time afterwards? Would he learn eventually that he gets to go out once a day and stop demanding? He has self-learned that when i grab his water bowl he's going to get fresh water and he'll sit there waiting patiently... would it work like that?... "
394,How do I take care of a day old abandoned Cockatiel?,"My Cockatiel laid four eggs and one of them hatched. Its been more than 12 hours but she never tried to feed the day old chick and simply warms the baby and sits on three of her other eggs. Has she abandoned it clearly? If so, how do I take care of it? "
395,Should I make eye contact with my relative's aggressive dog?,"I am visiting family for the holidays. One of the relatives has brought a dog that lays on the couch and barks whenever I come within, say, 10 feet of it. (For example, let's say I'm looking for the remote control or just wish to sit on the couch.) The dog behaves aggressively and barks loudly as if it were defending its territory (the couch).  My question is, how should I behave towards this dog? Specifically, should I make eye contact or avoid it? Should I let the dog have its space and stay away? Should I retreat when the dog barks at me or stand my ground? "
396,My Bunny had babies what do i do?,"So I recently got a free bunny from someone that found it out in the street. When we recieved it my dad thought it was really big and could possibly be pregnant .We let it roam around the house freely and has a spot where she does 1&amp;2, we noticed   it would constantly go into my parents room in the closet where there is a bunch of cloths and had noticed some spots with missing fur and didn't know why until this morning. It made like a nest with some towels and a bunch of fur, I saw something moving and they were babies:) I'm  not really sure what to do , should I leave them there where it's warm in the closet and let the bunny do her thing? Or put them in a box with towels and feed them? I'm guessing their about 7days old because they have fur , but haven't opened their eyes yet. Any info would be appreciated :) "
397,My dog eats everything that isn't food,"I've read other posts here on the topic of unwanted chewing behavior.   How can I stop my dog from chewing on everything. How can I train my dog to stop eating everything? my dogs eats sandals and plastics   None of the above offer a solution to my dog's behavior.  I've talked with different vets and spent hours googling the subject. All the advise I receive doesn't seem to address the extreme nature of my problem. It's not something a few days of dog training can stop.  My dog is now 6 months old and his endless chewing, eating and swallowing of anything he finds will not stop. It is not a random behavior, but is a constant never stopping moving from one spot to another looking for something to chew.  He requires by the second monitoring when he's let out of his room. Can not be left alone anywhere in the house. Can not be allowed to walk around freely and can not be trusted.  He is also a nipper, biter and grabber of hands, legs and feet. He especially bites my two daughters constantly. He does not have to be in a hyper state to bite. He will calmly walk up to anyone and just grab you. The biting is worse if he is excited.  But it really is the constant eating of non-food items that is driving me nuts. If he can not find something on the floor he will climb, jump, claw open or rip apart anything until he finds something.  We've spent a lot of money on leashes, dog gates, crates, dog toys, dog treats and gave him unlimited dog food (which resulted in lots more dog poop without a change in behavior). We can close the gate to the front room which has now been taken over as the dog room. If we remove everything from this room, fill it with hundreds of dog toys, dog treats and dog food. He will still chew the dry wall, crown molding and door frames.  I work from home, and share my office space with the dog. He does not have separation anxiety, and he is very well crate train (he will sleep in his crate with the door open on his own).  I take him for walks, take him to the dog park to run off leash and let him play outside for hours. Nothing is working. As soon as he is back inside he starts scanning for something to eat. He does not just chew it. He completely eats it.  Crayons, pencils, paper, tissue, shoes, hats, gloves, beer cans, soda cans, eye glasses, computer keyboards and mouse, wires, extension cords, TV remote, kids toys, soup cans, markers, play doh, glue bottles, books, etc.. etc..  We can not keep moving things out of reach and still live in the same house.  He is a happy, goofy and playful puppy but his large size (80lbs) and tall height (he can reach anything on a high counter, table or shelve) makes this behavior extra destructive and stressful.  He's been to the vet and everything checks out just fine. We've had blood work done, poop/pee tests and have taken him to training classes for puppies. We've tried positive rewards, negative rewards and even gave a remote buzzer a try.  Is there any hope that this will ever stop? "
398,Guppy and Turtle together?,"Since Turtles eaten all of my Goldfish I stopped putting more fish in the aquarium.   Now problem is today morning I saw too many mosquito larvae on surface of water. Seems turtles don't like them eating, but Guppy does. But I am afraid if I can put them with turtle ?  Is their any solution I can prevent aquarium water from mosquito larvae? "
399,What are common reasons that dogs beg?,"My dog ate an hour ago and is now in sitting front of me, begging. I let him outside and he immediately went to go pee, but when he came back inside he started begging again. What could he be begging for?  Some common reasons are for:   food attention to use the bathroom   What else could he be begging for and would there be a way to differentiate begging for each of these needs? "
400,Why does my tortoise make a peeping or whistling sound while breathing?,"I'm not asking for health-related advice, as I've had the vet following this for many years to make sure it's not respiratory-related, but this is more of a ""does it fit the animal's natural history"" question.  I have a Redfoot tortoise that tends to make a peeping or whistling sound when she's breathing, particularly when she's ""happy"" (I perceive her to enjoy when people are around, as she wants to be fed).  Is this a common behavior for tortoises in general to exhibit?  Is it some sort of call used to signal contentment or even alarm?     "
401,Are there benefits of feeding my cat homemade chicken broth,"I make a homemade soup by bringing to the boil and then simmering a chicken. I can do this without seasoning, when the chicken is thoroughly cooled, I pulls all the flesh from the bones and use this and the water as the base for the soup. I then add vegetables and salt.  If  don't use other seasoning, is it OK for my cat to drink the juice or broth from this mixture?  Should I only give it without salt and would the addition of freshly cooked vegetables affect the juice? What are the benefits or drawbacks? "
402,Does a dog's pink or white skin need special care?,"I have noticed there's a dog with white fur and pink skin on her belly, under her fur and on her nose.  Her skin is paler than most dogs I have noticed with black fur.  Is this pink skin more sensitive? Do she need protection when she's under direct sunlight?  "
403,Possible sign of dog-to-dog aggression in a 3 dog household,"I have a friend who recently adopted a boxer from a rescue (they've had the dog full-time for about a month now on a semi-trial basis).  There is little information on his history as he was just found wandering on the side of the highway without a collar or identification.  They estimate he is about 18-months old (in human years), and other than a few minor scars, he seems to be in fairly good shape so we don't think his situation was very traumatic.  The concern is the existing dogs in the house.  They have 2 others.  There is a 5 year old Chesapeake Bay Retriever (and in my opinion he is slightly crazy) and a 8 year old Pug.  All 3 dogs are males and all 3 are fixed.  The Chessie is a pure-bred bought from a breeder as a puppy and my friends have been his only owner.  The Pug was adopted from a shelter when he was about 6-months old.  Prior to the arrival of the Boxer, the Pug and the Chessie were relatively indifferent to each other.  The Pug let the Chessie have his way and never really bothered him much.  The Chessie also happens to be very possessive of toys (or anything that he has near him) so after getting growled at a few times when they were younger, the Pug seems to have decided that avoidance is the best measure.  When the Boxer arrived, he and the Pug became fast friends to the point that when the wrestle and play, the boxer actually the Pug ""win"".  The interaction between the Chessie and the Boxer is the concern.   When all 3 dogs are together, the Boxer always seems to make a point to keep himself between the Chessie and the Pug, and seems to be watching the Chessie with unusual interest (almost like he is keeping an eye on the Chessie and protecting the Pug). When just the Chessie and the Boxer are together one of 2 things happens  The Boxer mirrors the pugs indifference and just let's the Chessie go The Boxer follows the Chessie around.  This is the one that concerns everyone most.  The posture of the Boxer appears to be somewhat aggressive.  His head is lowered but stating right at the Chessie and he is always 2-3 steps right behind him.  This will go on for several minutes and then the Boxer will go off and do something else    This 2nd situation is what worries myself and my friend, but his wife doesn't seem to think much of it.  It appears to us that the Boxer is stalking the Chessie.  We're just not sure why and how much we should be concerned.  My friend's wife thinks that the Boxer is just following the lead dog around and thinks it is actually cute when it happens.   Is this stalking normal in that the boxer is just trying to test his limits with the biggest dog in the house?  The Chessie outweighs the boxer by about 35lbs (which is about 16kg for my metric friends).  The Chessie is close to 100lb and the boxer is almost 65lb, and the Chessie is almost as lean and muscular as the Boxer. Or is my friend's wife right and there is nothing to be worried about? Or is the Boxer sizing up the Chessie to challenge him?  This is why we are concerned as neither of us wants to try to separate 165lb of dog going at each other.   If it is the latter, is there anything we can do to help keep the piece?  Or is this something that will likely boil over at some point and it is just a matter of when? "
404,Removing budgerigar eggs,"We have several budgerigars and from time to time my partner sees an egg in their cage and disposes of it immediately. They are possibly fertile because we have both male and female budgies however the cage doesn't have a nesting area so it's probably unlikely the female would be able to keep the egg warm enough for it to hatch.  We keep a few small tree branches / leaves and the odd piece of fruit / veg on the bottom for them to nibble on but it doesn't really cover the entire area. Most of the eggs seem to be laid down the bottom directly on the bottom of the cage. While well sheltered it's outdoors so there would be cool air passing under the eggs.  Because budgies are somewhat skittish it's hard to know how long (if at all) they are trying to nest on them. I wondered if removing the eggs quickly may cause some sort of anxiety or if maybe it's better to leave them in place a while until they ""give up"" on them trying to hatch?  We're not especially interested in breeding them but if that seems like the most humane thing we're not certainly not opposed to it and I'm sure we can find them loving homes. If that sounds like a better option I'd also be interested to know at what point eggs that haven't hatched should be removed? "
405,How do I comfortably and safely bathe my Whippet?,"I posted this question about my whippet here: How can I help my Whippet cope with his shaking and trembling?   This is a question related to my whippets shivering, but a little specific.  He is very nervous, whippets can be like this, but I am having trouble bathing him. He doesn't fight, he's very cooperative, but he shivers and shakes so badly, it's horrible to see. He has been vet checked and is perfectly healthy.  I have tried a couple of different bathing methods:     I've tried filling the laundry tub (as it is high and not too large so I can be up at his height and reassure him). I use warm water and do not run the tap while he is in the tub. The other method I tried is to use a bucket and soft cloth and gently sponge him in the sun.  There are two concerns I have.   Being a skinny Whippet, is he getting cold, or is it just nerves?  If it is nerves, how can I alleviate his stress?  "
406,Do bunnies eat their droppings?,"I was watching a bunny, he was sitting up, and seemed to be grooming his private parts.  When his head came up it looked like he was chewing on something.  After a couple minutes he hopped away and I could see what looked like a soft squishy poop, not all like regular bunny droppings.    Could he have been eating his own dropping? What was going on? "
407,How often and long should I walk my puppy?,"My puppy is seven weeks old, we have been playing with her and getting her used to running around with a collar and lead. She quite enjoys coming for walks, even with the lead on.  Aside from issues of vaccination:  Is it safe to take my puppy for walks? How often should we take her walking? How long should the walks be?    In response to this answer What can I do if my puppy is hyperactive? I thought it would be a good idea to discuss the effects of walking on puppy health. "
408,When is it safe to take my dog out to the park?,"My puppy is six weeks old and has only had her first vaccination. I want to start socialising her with other dogs and people, but don't want her to catch any nasty canine diseases.  When is it safe for me to take her to the dog park to socialise with other dogs, do I need to wait until she is fully vaccinated?  What other options are there to socialize my puppy before she is fully vaccinated?  A question that fits well with How often and long should I walk my puppy?. "
409,How do I determine when my tortoise is sated?,"... and, if there's no way to tell when she is, are there any long-term effects of (mildly) overfeeding her?  I've given my tortoise a lot of food, she'll often ""put some aside"", but more because she wants to take a break and lie down or sprawl out and relax for a bit.  Are these positive indicators for tortoises that they have had enough food?   "
410,Is there anything beyond preference that dictates whether dry food should be wet down?,"Particularly with dogs, this seems to be something that comes up often in their care.  When giving the animal ""dry"" dog food, is there anything beyond the animal's individual preferences that should dictate whether a small amount of water should be added to the food?  Are there any health conditions that would preclude giving the dog just the dry food if he/she likes it that way?  "
411,Can a cat with a sluggish colon have dry food?,"The is question Is there anything beyond preference that dictates whether dry food should be wet down? and comments brought up and interesting issue.  If a cat has a sluggish colon, can she have dry food?  What is a good way to manage my cat's diet with this condition in mind? "
412,Why does my cat hold its mouth slightly open sometimes after smelling something?,"On occasion, my cat will sit there with their mouth open, usually after smelling something new.  It looks similar to panting, but without the heavy breathing or a protruding tongue.  What is the reason for this?  Is it a reaction to particular smells?  We refer to it as the ""stink face"", but does it really indicate that a scent was disagreeable? "
413,Is dry food better for a pets teeth?,"I had always heard that dry food was better for my dog and cat because it helps keep their teeth clean, I even remember TV commercials about dry treats that would clean the dog’s teeth.  In the question Is there anything beyond preference that dictates whether dry food should be wet down? comments suggest that dry food is not really helpful.  Is the whole dry food = better teeth thing a myth or what? "
414,Is it ok if I stir the substrate of my aquarium?,"I have an aquarium with a 5 cm (+- 2 in) rock-and-clay pellets substrate. I stir it every 6 months, to remove some of algae and so on that is deposited there. That way, the water gets a bit muddy and in about 6 hours the filter takes care of it.  I wonder if there is any need to clean the substrate at all. Should I leave it alone, with all those bacteria, algae, fish poop and so on? Is my current method of cleaning sufficient or should I clean it another way (eg: using a siphon)? "
415,How can I re-teach my cats to eat insects?,"Two of my cats were avid insect hunters in our old apartment.    We were near a farm, so we had lots of flies hanging outside our front door and our patio, and some would invariably get in during the warmer months.  I taught both of the cats to hunt the flies by making a distinctive noise to alert them, and then assisting in stunning the flies with a newspaper so that they could catch them.  Both of them quickly learned to come running whenever they heard me make that sound, and would immediately start scanning the walls to find the bug, especially if they saw me pointing.  This worked out to be a rather efficient means of eliminating flies and moths that found their way into our apartment, as well as providing entertainment and exercise for the cats.  However, several years ago we moved into a house in a different neighborhood.  We still get the odd insect intruder, but it is far, far rarer.  Even worse, the two most common intruders we find are stink bugs, and ladybugs.  Both exude a noxious chemical defense when disturbed (although ladybugs don't stink nearly as bad as stink bugs do, it is more than enough to dissuade a sensitive feline nose).  While I have not seen either cat have an actual run-in with either type of insect, that doesn't mean it hasn't happened.  However, now none of our cats will eat any insects.  Of the original two that I taught to hunt, only one shows more than a passing interest in insects, and while she gets extremely excited to spot a moth, and will relentlessly follow it around the house, meowing pitifully, she won't attack it, and even if I knock it down, she won't eat it.  Is it possible to teach my cats to distinguish between ""good"" insects (e.g. ones that are flying) and ""bad"" (stinky) insects, and rekindle their hunting instincts?  Or have my cats been traumatized by insect stench to the point where I have to swat my own flies? "
416,Is there a way to prevent another dog from pooping on our grass?,"Our regularly-trimmed grass outside our gate has been pooped on by another dog. I don't know the dog and I've been trying to determine which dog it was.  I know about dogs being territorial, and that another dog might not poop on our grass once he realizes that our dog is in the house.  Is there any way I can use my dog to mark the grass to notify the other dog that he should not go there? or Is there another way to prevent the other dog from pooping on our grass?  "
417,Are non-dangerous spiders (to humans) dangerous to dogs?,"I am fortunate to live an area were we have few spiders that have venom potent enough to be dangerous to humans, however, my yard seems to support a significant spider population of various species, so I am wondering if I need to be worried or not.  To clarify a bit, obviously weight (of the dog) is going to have a major influence on this so I want to try to avoid that part of the conversation.  I'm more concerned about physiology.  Is the physiology of dogs similar enough to humans that the impact of a spiders venom would be the same in dogs as it is in humans?  Or would the venom from a spider affect a dog differently than a human? "

420,Caring for a dog and its 11 puppies,"A dog gave birth to more than 11 puppies near my house. 1 has been reported dead, walked over by a car. They are living beside the road in a place where people park cars. I cannot adopt even one of them because in my family they are considered dirty. I gave the mother some Marie biscuits.

421,Why is my rabbit / bunny angry?,"My pet rabbit sometimes gets angry when I walk past her. She then makes a growling sound and ""attacks"" me.   We had her spayed and thought that this would help, but the problem still persists.  Is there a reason for this happening? Can it be treated? "
422,Recommendations on low-fat foods for pancreatitis in dog?,"My 4 year old dog was recently diagnosed with pancreatitis.  My vet has made it sound as though this usually happens for a few reasons:   The dog ate something weird/abnormal and it caused temporary inflammation For whatever reason, the dog is more vulnerable to pancreas inflammation and it will likely happen again if not kept on a proper diet   Since my dog hasn't had any changes in diet or gotten into anything, I'm leaning towards the latter being our reality.  I was instructed that the best treatment is a low-fat diet, and was sent home with prescription low-fat i/d food.  However, this food is expensive for someone on a low budget, and already providing additional medication to treat the dogs epilepsy.   Does anyone have any suggestions for cost effective, low-fat food diets for dogs?  Specifically with tendencies of pancreatitis?   Edits to address comments  Our regular food regimen prior to this was Blue Buffalo: Chicken and Brown Rice, which he has eaten for the majority of his life.  I'm able to buy a 30lbs bag of Blue Buffalo for about [tex]35 for an 8lbs bag. "
423,"Tip of lopard geckos tail fell off, what do I do?","I just adopted a leopard gecko about a week ago, and she had some stuck shed. I gave her a moist hide box to see if it would help, this morning I soaked her in water and the shed started to peal it off.  The stuck shed on her toes came off pretty easy but the tip of her tail was horrible, 5 layers of stuck shed came off! I noticed she had a red band around where the stuck shed was, it looked like an open cut to I cleaned it up and let her be.  Its been a few hours now and I noticed the whole tip of her tail looks dead.    What do I do? Will it fall off on its own?  If so will it grow back?  "
424,What is this tufty white spot on my goldfish's head?,"I noticed today that my goldfish, Thunderbolt, has a tuft of white on its head.      Note: Same fish. coloration difference due to camera flash   I've had the fish in a 10 gallon tank by itself for about 3 years, and I have not recently changed anything. The only minor change I can think of is adding an old algecide tablet to the water about 6 weeks ago, but this growth is much newer than that.The water is also slightly cooler now that winter temperatures have arrived (the tank is about 68oF vs 78oF a few months ago -- but this has been a gradual decline and not unusual for this time of year). I last did a 30% water change about 2.5 weeks ago.   Any idea what this might be and what I can do about it?  I don't want to lose my fish :(  UPDATE:  I initially gave my goldfish a salt treatment (~1.5tbsp of aquarium salt / gallon), which caused the white tuft to rescind to being only a white spot (no fluffy outgrowths). I thought my fish was on the way to recovery.  However, about 2 weeks later (~1 month after initial symptoms), my fish's condition worsened. The fish lost almost all control of its air bladder (which I began treating with peas, which helped) and became very lethargic. On a few occasions I've found the fish resting motionless being partially sucked up by my filter. The white tuft had likewise started growing again...  I started treating my tank with API Fungus Cure (contains Victoria Green B + Acriflavine).   I'm on day 4 of treatment, but now my fish looks like this:     The spot has grown lumpy and red/bloody... (does this suggest a secondary bacterial infection perhaps?)  Now what should I do??....  UPDATE2:  It's been 6 months, and my poor little goldfish has been a real trooper. I treated the water on 2 additional occasions with the API Fungus Cure (which  totaled 3 complete treatments in ~3 months). The spot remained red and tufty for more than a month. However, after all treatments (and time), the spot is certainly no longer tufty or red and has not been for at least ~3 months now. Instead, it's just a white looking scab on his head. I ASSUME THIS IS GOOD?     However, his behavior has never been the same :(.   Specifically, his air bladder control seems to be near non-existent now, and I find him stuck upside down about 80% of the time.   Though, actually it's better than it was 2-3 mo ago -- he would purposefully wedge himself between plants or rock to keep himself from floating to the top. Now he seems to have a bit better control.  feeding him peas 1-3x per week momentarily helps him a bit, but not as much as it used to when this ordeal first started.     One other thing to note: the tank randomly turned very cloudy and stayed that way for a month starting about 6 weeks ago. This was more than a month after my last fungus treatment. Water changes did nothing, but finally I came home one day and the water was clear again. The fish never seemed bothered by it. I assumed it was a bacterial bloom, but in a 10 year old tank seemed strange... (I'll have to ask a new question about this one). "
425,How to deal with persistent fleas on a DLH cat,"I have two pet cats, one DSH (domestic short hair) and one DLH (domestic long hair). As outdoor cats both get fleas often, but this recent spate is proving impossible to shift on the long haired one.  This is what I've attempted so far:   8 Oct, used Broadline, a vet-prescribed anti-flea treatment to both cats (this is usually enough) 22 Oct, sprayed both cats and all carpets, bed sheets, curtains, sofas with Bob Martin all-in-one flea spray 8 Nov, re-applied Broadline and fumigated the entire flat with 3x Bob Martin flea bombs, bought brand new duvet and pillow cases 20 Nov, re-sprayed both cats and the entire flat with the all-in-one flea spray   Along with all this, I'm also vacuuming the entire flat every day or two.  Nothing seems to shift the fleas living on the cat. I found dead fleas everywhere after fumigating, and they seemed to subside on the cat, but never fully went away, and it's getting quite worrying: she's constantly twitching her tail (they seem to be congregating around her genitalia) and is very restless (finding it hard to rest due to the un-comfort), and has scratched and bitten herself loads trying to clear them - her skin under her fur is all scabby and sore. She hates being brushed, but I'm trying the best I can to brush her as often as possible as best I can.  I've just purchased two flea traps and another three flea bombs, and the cat is booked in at the vets on Friday to see what they say, but I was wondering if there was anything anyone here could recommend? I'm not sure if I'm paranoid, but I feel like every time I use de-flea treatments on her she goes a little bit ""crazy"", with nervous ticks and skittish behaviour - could the treatments be poisoning her and making her ill? I'm not going over the recommended 4-weeks between Broadline treatments, but I am supplementing them with the spray.  It's genuinely distressing and heartbreaking to see her suffer from these.  I am located in the UK. "
426,Red eared slider laying eggs into the water,"6 months ago I rescued two red eared sliders that had been abandoned by their previous owner. A couple of weeks ago one of my new turtles started laying eggs.   After doing some quick research I've set up an area for her to lay her eggs in, with about 8 inches of soil. She seems to prefer to lay her eggs in the water though where she quickly eats them before I can get them out. She's been doing this for a couple of weeks now and I'm wondering:    How many eggs will she lay? How long will it take her to lay them? How can or should I redirect her from laying in the water to laying in soil? How can I tell when shes about to lay another egg?  "
427,Vivarium Tank Moving,"I have a 20 gallon tank vivarium which is not filled with water and is only 1/5 filled with substrate, rocks, etc. I keep my tank on my bookshelf next to my window and occasionally move it to my desk where the outside air can flow into the tank.   Recently, I noticed that a line formed in the middle of the tank casing (the black part of the tank found on the top and bottom of the tank). I believe that this line formed because of my moving of the tank around and so the pressure when I move the tank builds up in the middle of the tank.   Will my tank crack and explode if I keep doing this? I watched some videos online and read some other posts saying that the silicone may weaken if you move your tank around too much. Is this true?  "
428,How accurate is dog DNA testing?,"I always rescue my dogs and recently (1 year ago) rescued one for my parents.  I've spent the last 12 months training her.  My dad is interested in knowing what breed she is, but I am skeptical on the DNA testing?  How accurate is it?  This site says it's accurate, but only for determining the majority breed.     Sutter says such dog DNA tests can typically identify the majority breeds in a canine with great accuracy.    This site says they are fairly accurate     Dog DNA tests tend to be fairly accurate, although the quality of accuracy can vary depending on the tools used to asses dog genealogy and the sophistication of the laboratory used.   What can I do to make the test more accurate?  If my dad's dog has several breeds mixed in her (likely) how well can we identify those? "

432,Something on my cat is biting me,"My cat is just over one year old; she's an ex-feral who we trapped at about nine weeks. Since then she's been 95% indoor cat with no direct contact with other cats, but occasionally she slips out of the back door and sits in the back yard for a little while before coming back inside.  She likes to cuddle, but just in the last few weeks, I find myself coming up with itchy red bumps a couple of hours after cuddling her. They look and feel similar to mosquito bites, and they only appear in the areas where we've been in contact. I don't have any history of allergies, and I haven't had any allergic-type reaction when she's scratched me. My best guess is that she has some sort of parasite that's biting. Obviously I would like to deal with this, for her sake and for mine.  We took her to the vet, who checked her over and swabbed her ears for mites but found nothing. (We do have birds roosting in the roof and I've seen a few mites inside near there.) My wife tried combing her with a flea comb over white paper, but nothing showed up. She is in very good health; I see her scratching occasionally but not for an extended period. She has long hair and it's in excellent condition. If it weren't for the bites I'd have no reason to suspect any kind of parasites. Some possibilities I've considered:   Cat fleas: she had a few when we caught her but she was treated at the time. It's possible that she picked up a few on one of her trips into the garden, and it would explain the bites. But neither the vet nor my wife found any fleas on her. (OTOH she does have long hair, so it might be possible for a flea to hide?) Mites: the ones I've seen around the house are tiny, so they might evade a flea comb, but I'm not aware of them causing bites like this on humans. Also not sure if bird mites would live on a cat. Cat lice: a few weeks back I did see a small white arthropod that looked a bit like a cat louse on her head, but didn't manage to catch it. I haven't seen any since, and it was large enough that I'd expect it to show up in combing, so maybe it was just a random passing bug. Also, I don't think cat lice bite humans?   Is there anything I've missed, that would live on a cat for several weeks and bite humans without being easily noticeable by a vet?   NB: we're in Australia, it's late spring here. "
433,Is there a genealogy test for pets?,"Is there a test out there like ""23 and me"" except for pets? Is there even anything out there like this? I would pay top-dollar to have this done. I'd like to see if my cat has any Cheeta in her. "
434,What can go wrong if people carry 1 week old kittens alot?,"My cat gave delivery a week ago and on the first day till now she lets us (6 people ages 6 to 20) touch her kittens and even carry them if we wish. Ofcourse no one touched the kittens on the first three days even though she allows. We have a great relationship with her and she is a family member. The wierd thing is that she's usually rude I'd like to say (best word to describe) and she swats or yells angrily if someone annoys her a lot. She is also nice at times but to tell you the truth, most of the household thought that she'd become even more strict and defensive after she recieves a litter(except me, I expected her to be nice, shes usually nicer to me, I'm special 😎). But the point is, shouldn't she become very defensive and want everyone away? My sister literally touched them on the first day (mistakenly) and the cat only licked her finger. It happened like this, sister put her hand in the box which have the kittens expecting that Joury the cat is alone(didn't know that delivery was here), she wanted to pet her and surprisingly my sister feels a wierd thing (afterwards discovers that it's the belly tube) she feels the cat had licked her, hears a kitten cry,and takes her hand out to have a look. When she looks she discovers babies. I want to experiment my cat's reaction if I pat her after giving a litter, I somewhat expect her to hit, but she's so nice and loving. On the same day afterwards the cat presents a trick, she stands up on two feet to get food or treats and plays afterwards as if nothing had happened. She gave birth very intelligently and had done the job alone. She cares for the babies very good, they are very clean and so is she. But she does not give a damn if we touch them. She's acting as if the babies are everyones. We understand cat signs and I'm pretty sure she doesn't care. Infact I can grab a kitten right now even if it's sleeping or nursing and she'd be okay. I know it's nice and she trusts us, but shouldn't she be more definsive? Is she immature? It's her first litter. We have neighbors spending a couple weeks with us and she hisses at their kids if the kids corner her. So this kindness she gives isn't for everyone. If we pat her feet or hip a couple of times to annoy her she hits, if we give extra love she hits, if we carry kittens she's okay. Why is that? Is this a problem I should consider?They are 1 week old now, they look healthy, but can it be we are cuasing something bad to happen in the long run? Also can their be behaviour problems with them when they grow if carried a lot at such an early age?   Edit: The cat tries to have them back now once they cry. Reliefing. But I'd still love an answer explaining about the kittens side. "
435,Seriously violent fights between cats that have coexisted peacefully for years,"this is my first question on SE, I hope I am doing it right.  My girlfriend and I have two adult cats, a 6 years old male and a 3 y.o. female, both neutered. We brought the lady home when she was just a few month old. The older cat didn't take it very well at the time, but after a while he accepted her and they have been getting along well ever since, save the odd random skirmish. Until today.  We were watching a video featuring two cats hissing at each other, at the end of which something funny was supposed to happen. We'll never know what it would be because, all of the sudden, our cats turned on each other with a violence we hadn't seen since we first brought home the youngest. We struggled to put off the fight, luckily before anyone got seriously injured, but the tension hasn't died out yet. We have tried to bring them together twice and both time they tried to jump at each other's throat. We are keeping them separate now, but the situation is rather distressing for everyone.  Has anyone experienced something similar? Should we wait until things settle themselves or is there something we should do to bring back peace?  Thanks to anyone answering. "
436,How many hours should a cat sleep to be healthy? What are the effects of less and more sleep? Is it same for feral cats?,"Cats sleep often. But how many hours of average sleep per day is healthy for a cat?  If a cat sleeps less than that required, then what are the side effects?  Also if a cat sleeps more than that required, what are the side effects?  Is sleeping pattern of feral cats the same as indoor house cats? Is there any different form of sleeping pattern in indoor house cats due to absence of natural events of a forest? "
437,Is it possible to train dogs to share their toys?,"We just adopted a second dog who is a female. We have a male dog which we adopted 3 years ago.  He's used to having free access to all of his toys (he's a spoiled brat). I read that when you introduce a second dog, you should remove all toys and slowly introduce new toys to each dog. So far, we have taken away all toys except today we just introduced each dog to a toy. Each dog is very possessive about their new toy. If one dog shows interest in the other dogs toy, the other other dog will be aggressive.  They both do this to each other.  For now, because the recently adopted dog has only been in our house for a few days, we take all toys away unless we are supervising the dogs. I'm wondering if it's possible for the dogs to learn to share their toys in the future, or is this a behavior that needs to be trained? If so, how should we go about training them to share their toys? We would ultimately like to leave their toys out again as we did with our first dog, so they can have things to chew on when ever they get the urge. "
438,How fast do rabbits really breed?,"Someone recently mentioned ""breeding like rabbits"". So my question is how fast do rabbits breed?  If I accidentally bring home a pregnant female rabbit, or a male and female pair from the local fair, and she has babies, and I keep everyone together, without having any spayed or neutered, how fast will they reproduce?    I will of course keep feeding them, and making sure they have good care.  Really how bad could it be?  So maybe I have 6 or eight bunnies to find homes for by the fair next year. right? "

440,Can I put tetras in a tank with barbs in it?,"I recently bought a new aquarium, along with four tiger barbs. I have already introduced two new Rosie barbs into the tank with them.   I'm now wondering if I can introduce tetra fish into tank. And if yes, then which type of tetra should I introduce? How many of them minimum should be kept together? "
441,International travel with cockatiels (moving from the US),"I am looking for information on moving from the US to a different country with two cockatiels.  (We are two people travelling, in case each is allowed to bring only one bird.)  What airlines allow travelling with caged birds in the cabin?  Are there any that are generally recommended for travelling with pets?  Generally, what are important things to think about when planning such a trip?  My primary concern is the safety of the birds.  Much of the information I can find is about cats and dogs, and travelling with birds seems to be more difficult.  I am also very worried about transporting the birds in the cargo hold.  Cockatiels freak out easily and can seriously injure themselves by flapping in a cage.  I'd strongly prefer taking them to the cabin, but it is not clear how this is going to be possible (though it seems that depending on the destination country it may be allowed by certain airlines).  I know there are services for international pet transport.  In this case is it better to try to use them than taking the birds myself?  (I don't think so as someone should be there to calm them down if they freak out.) "
442,Goat just gave birth and I'm worried,My pygmy goat gave birth about 2 to 3 hours ago. She has passed her afterbirth but she is still having contractions and discharge again and she won't let us touch her because she has always been scared of people since we got her! I'm very worried about her. Could she still have a baby inside? What else could be causing this? This is our first time with a delivery and I don't want anything to happen to her! 
443,Are there native web building spiders in North America that can be domesticated?,"This question flows from a couple of previous questions 1, 2 about pet(s) to control insect pests in the home.  One comment in particular caught my attention, and lead to me asking this.  Is there web building spider native to North America (or at least not considered an invasive pest) that can be encouraged to live in a person's home? How can I identify it?   Once in the home, what should I do to support it and let it know it is a welcomed and valued member of the household (i.e. a pet)? What nutritional needs do I need to address in times when natural prey are unavailable?  In short, what is the optimal small spider pet and how do I care for it?  Where optimal = pet to control flying pests. "
444,Can Whiskas cause kidney disease?,"I heard a local veterinarian to say that Whiskas can cause kidney disease. I tried to research that claim, but so far I haven't been able to find academic articles  dealing with this issue, even though there is a vast amount of anecdotal evidence.  I was wondering if anyone knows for certain if this is true or false. Apparently, older cats have propensity to suffer from kidney disease. However, some people say veterinarians have told them that Whiskas was responsible for the death of their cats. I suppose that veterinarians know about the incidence of kidney disease in cats, so it is surprising to read that kind of blanket statements being made by professionals.  Some people say that taurine is to blame. However, taurine is classified as an essential nutrient by the VCA Animal Hospitals. Others say that dry food or fiber is what makes cats sick, but again no evidence is offered to support this view.  UPDATE: In response to @DanS: It is hard to answer precisely your question. As far as I know, there are not guidelines on daily recommended intake for cats. I even found some opinions saying that nobody knows (e.g. here). However, when it comes to protein there seems to be a magic number: 36%. It almost seems that food companies strive to reach that number. Of course, the question should be: 36% of what? In the package I bought, it says that the recommended amount  is between 45g and 90g depending on age. This is equivalent to 16g and  32g of protein, respectively. Keep in mind that the product I bought is intended for kittens. Now, the only table of values I found was published (pdf) by FEDIAF (page 17.) It says the recommended amount of protein is 25.0g for adults and 28-30g when cats are still growing per 100g of dry food. As you can see, if my package contained 100g, it would have 35.5g of protein, an increase of 15% with respect to the highest recommended daily intake given by FEDIAF. Is this a significant increase? I don't know.  As for salts, I only know that Whiskas contains iodized salt but the product I bought doesn't say the amount. Other ingredients are specified in another paragraph but without percentages or amounts. "
445,Why do cats behave differently in Japan?,"I've been living in Japan for the past year and a half, and I've noticed that cats here generally seem to behave differently from the cats in England, where I'm from. People from other European countries and the USA say the same thing.  In England, most cats are shy and will run away from an unfamiliar human, while a few others are gregarious and will approach strangers and seek affection from them. In Japan one often sees cats just sitting there and more-or-less ignoring people who pass by or approach them, which isn't something I ever really saw before coming here. (The exception would be a few cats I've known that live in a bar or a shop and have learnt to mostly ignore the customers, but in Japan one sees this behaviour all the time, just in the street.)  Similarly, in Britain, cats are very territorial and will generally fight other cats. You wouldn't expect to see two or three cats calmly sitting next to each other unless they were in an enclosed space such as a house. But it's a common sight outdoors in Japan.  Examples of these behaviours can be found on YouTube. For example, the cats in this video are probably trained, but the behaviour of average cats found in public places is often not so different.  Does anybody know the reason for this? I can think of a few possibilities. It might be genetic, or it might be because of the very high population density (of both humans and cats), or it might be because Japanese people behave differently towards cats than western people. (Cats are considered lucky in Japanese culture.) I'm interested in which if any of these explanations is correct. Have the reasons for the behavioural differences between Japanese and European cats been studied, and is the answer known? "
446,Cat pees in the same spot. What can I do?,"My indoor-only neutered male adult cat is always peeing in the same spot. I've tried all kinds of litter boxes, and he pees and poops in the box, but he's now getting into this habit of peeing in a very specific spot in the apartment.  Is there something (a product or a mixture) that I can spray in the area so that he stops peeing there?  Or are there any plants that I can put there?  I'm including a pictute of my cat's pee. Someone asked me if he was spraying, and I don't think he is. It's a puddle on the floor, and the odd thing is that there's a small crack on the floor next to where he pees:  As you can see, I've clearly identified the urine.   "

448,Would my work schedule rule out getting a dog?,"I have been thinking about getting a dog (a medium or large breed - most likely large), as I have always wanted one, and my daughter wants one. I live in north-central Florida, where we have hot summers, warm springs and autumns, and cold to warm winters, in case anyone is wondering what the outside conditions would be. The issue lies in that I work 12-hour graveyard-shifts on a rotating schedule, and my daughter is with her mother on days I work.   I work from 7pm to 7am. If we look at my work-schedule on a bi-weekly basis, the first week I work Monday, Tuesday, Friday, Saturday, and Sunday. The second week, I work Wednesday and Tuesday, and I am off the rest of the days that week - Mind you, I would be getting off at 7am on my first ""off-day"", and then probably sleeping until about 2pm.  My idea is that my dog would be both an outside and inside dog, but while I am at work, she will live outside, and while I am home, she can come inside. It would be about 12.5 hours by the time I leave the house to go to work and the time I come back, so that's far too long to let her stay inside having to hold in her movements while also seriously increasing the risk of an accident caused by an inability to hold in said movements or from her simply getting bored and tearing up the place.  While she is outside, she would have about half an acre of fenced in yard to frolic in. I would obviously build her some type of kennel with access to plenty of water, and food for the night. The house is located in a rural area.  On days that I am off and home at night, though, I would like her to be able to sleep inside.   So, my questions are:  Is it too long of a period of time to be leaving her alone and outside?   Is this schedule too crazy for her to understand that she can only come inside and/or sleep inside while I'm home, and the opposite while I am away? (This is the main question I am seeking an answer for.)  What kinds of affects would this have on a dog if my daughter and I take the time to love her while I am home? "
449,My Rottweiler puppy is sick,"I have a Rottweiler pup who is about 12-13 weeks old. About Tuesday he became uncharacteristicly lethargic and wouldn’t eat. We took him to the vet and he received some fluids and an injection to help with digestion and we were told to monitor him. It is now Thursday and I’m becoming increasingly worried about him. He still refused any food we tried to give him, even treats. He will drink water now, which is an improvement, but he has white colored diarrhea and yellow throw up. We currently do not have the money to afford for the vet to run extensive tests but he’s getting thinner by the day.  Does anyone have an idea of what illness this could be or what could’ve caused this? How can I help him? How can I coax him back into eating without irritating his stomach again? "
450,leopard gecko odd behavior-,"i got my leo a month ago. i love her to bits, her name's frankie. the vet said she was around 6 months old. maybe i'm just worrying too much, but i figured i should get input anyway.  to begin, i have a hot side and cool side of the tank; the hot side is 87 and the cool side is 70. the hot side is powered by a heat lamp, which also powers the heat mat underneath (otherwise it can't maintain its heat). the substrate is reptile carpet, which i clean at the end of the week with all of her hides and tank. i feed her every day 3 crickets and i switch between calcium spray (i also have powder in a bowl for her to eat whenever she needs it)and multivitamin. i also have a UVB light set up that i put on during the day so she can rest.  she's a weird one; she's constipated and it worries me. i feel like she doesn't poop as much as a leopard gecko should, and when she does (it does have its white and brown component), it looks like a literal bean. it's also a bit wet. unfortunately she always poops whenever i'm not around, so it gets dried out by the heat lamp and therefore can't be tested (and her poops are so rare. i'll try and get a sample this weekend if she does). in addition, she sometimes makes noises out of the blue. i know they're capable of doing so, but with that and the constipation, something seems off. she's also an unstable walker. yes, she can run, but when she walks slowly, it's always very shaky. today she had a head spasm (maybe she was swallowing?? this happened after eating, but the crickets are pretty small) for a few seconds and that worried me even more.   she eats regularly. sometimes i see her drink water. although today when i finished feeding her, she tried lunging for a rock. she bit it too, and when i took them away, she kept looking at them as i moved them back and forth. i did this to test if they were interesting to her. and i was right. so no more rocks in the tank. i then changed her water, and after putting reptisafe in it, she looked at the bottle the same way she looked at the rocks. i think she wanted to eat that too.   i took her to the vet on monday. after an exam (which consisted of looking at her stomach for signs of impaction, her gums, and eyes), she was fine, however her feces couldn't be tested since they'd dried out. the vet said (at least for the constipation issue) to use a UVB light (which i had just started) and to maybe try a bath. i know that frankie will hate it; she doesn't like me holding her.   this was...a lot.  the question: why is she constipated and what can i do? ever since i started the UVB light, i feel like her constipation's gotten worse. it's been a week since she's pooped.

451,"Source of RHD2 found in Medina County, OH?","My local house rabbit community is concerned about a recent outbreak of RHD2.  This virus has 90% fatality rate.  In the US It seems to only affect domestic rabbits, in other parts of the world the domestic rabbit and the wild rabbit are the same species and it can be devastating. In those countries there is a vaccine available, the vaccine is not available in the US.       On Sept. 19, rabbit hemorrhagic disease virus 2 (RHD2) was detected in a domestic rabbit in Medina County.       The rabbits at this location were housed in horse stalls and ran free in those stalls. They have been on site for several years and there has been no movement of rabbits on or off the premises recently. The Ohio Department of Agriculture (ODA) will work with state and federal partners to conduct surveillance of wild rabbits near the location. Source   It is very contagious, it can be transmitted between rabbit colonies, in feed, bedding, or human clothing.      Rabbit haemorrhagic disease (RHD), also known as rabbit calicivirus disease (RCD) or viral haemorrhagic disease (VHD), is a highly infectious and often fatal disease that affects wild and domestic rabbits of the species Oryctolagus cuniculus. The infectious agent responsible for the disease is rabbit haemorrhagic disease virus (RHDV), or rabbit calicivirus (RCV), genus Lagovirus of the family Caliciviridae. The virus infects only rabbits, and has been used in some countries to control rabbit populations. source   I have looked at all the available information, and can not find the route of infect for these rabbits.  We would be very interested in finding the source of this infection, so it can be avoided.   What is the source of RHD2 found in Medina County, OH?  Edit Feb 18, 2019 Dec 7, 2018 there was an outbreak in Clover Township, PA of type 1 (different strain than the type 2 cases in Ohio and Canada earlier in 2018).

454,"Parakeet sudden death, trying to figure out cause","My stepdaughter had a young (less than a year old) parakeet that was in a cage. She allowed her cat into her room and the cat toppled the cage off of her nightstand, making it flip over once with the bird inside. The bird got out of the cage and the cat had access to it, but we found the bird alive.  We put the bird back in the cage (stepdaughter was at work) with some food and water and assumed it was ok. We checked on the bird the next day to find that it had gotten out of the cage and was dead on the floor, across the room from the cage (several sliding doors on the cage were open about an inch, but were very hard to see that they were open). The cat did not have access to the bird at this time.   Could shock have caused this? Can a young bird last less than 24 hours without food and water? 24 hours would have been the maximum time.  Thanks for any answers. We're the parents, not the caretakers of the bird. "
455,taking care of newborn cats,My friend has a female cat and she gives birth every year (maybe 3 times a year although I'm not sure). I wanted to take one of her kitten this time although I have some questions:   Is it cruel or bad taking her kittens?     Should I take her kitten in the day they born? or should I wait until they open their eyes? How hard is taking care of first day born kitten?  
456,I need advice on a vocally demanding dog,"I have a 5-6 month old GSD who constantly barks at me for attention, how do I discourage the barking aspect?  TLDR - For background and context.   I am completely aware that German Shepherds are working dogs (especially ours as they are from working lines) and im fully aware of what we bought as we already have one that is 2 years old so I know that they need alot of upkeep.   My partner and I have a second GSD who has developed a habit of barking at us for attention, whether it be play or strokes, same thing. Something our other GSD doesn't do.  She gets 1 hour intense walk at 6am every morning where I work her and try to make it as engaging (and tiring!) as possible but not too much as she is still young. I do all sorts of things, ring work, bite work, tugging, fetch and obedience, bits of everything really. Which does tire her out for the most part, she may have a play with our other one when we get back but more often than not she settles down and we go to work.  She also goes to a working dog club on a weekend to work on aspects and do fun stuff like obedience and protection work etc.   When we get back from work she wants constant attention which is great to engage with her and keep us the main interest. But she barks when we don't give her immediate attention. This is the aspect I want to discourage. I want her to be able to part entertain herself and also come to us, just not demand attention by barking. Our other GSD isn't as demanding and is happy to entertain herself, play with us or sleep, she isn't as vocally demanding.  Is there any advice anyone can give? "

460,Is it safe to wear a Thunder Shirt for an extended period of time?,"We have a 6-7 year old pancreatic American Eskimo that had been symptom-free for several months. Several weeks ago we got a Thunder Shirt as a gift and she generally seems to enjoy wearing it (for example, she doesn't move awkwardly while wearing it). But this week, after having worn it continuously for several days in a row, she threw up. She had also been acting a bit out of sorts for the last two days, staying in her crate and dodging most attempts to pet her, etc.  We've been adhering strictly to her dietary requirements, not feeding her anything unless its Guaranteed Analysis indicates a Crude Fat Max of 9% or less (her regular food is 4% max), so we don't think this could be food related.  When I took the Thunder Shirt off this morning, she seemed to liven up a bit, sat with me on the couch, and even presented her belly for a while, at which point I noticed digestive-type sounds coming from her abdomen at regular intervals - maybe every five seconds or so. I theorized that wearing the Thunder Shirt for multiple days could have been constricting one of her internal organs, and now that I'd removed it, whatever was constricted suddenly started doing whatever it was supposed to be doing. But my wife said it's just the sound of impending diarrhea and not related to the Thunder Shirt.  Could the Thunder Shirt have caused, or contributed to, my dog getting sick? Or did she just start acting more normal after I took it off because she was already feeling better after throwing up, and the timing was just a coincidence? "
461,Why do dogs hold specific objects in their mouth?,"I found this Yahoo answer, stating dogs carry specific objects around because of an emotional attachment. I'm curious if they have the ability to form that kind of attachment.   My pug is obsessed with stuffed animals, but usually only plays with one stuffed shark. I haven't been able to pair a few specific situations where she goes to the stuffed shark, it seems random. Sometimes she goes weeks without playing with it, other times it's every day.   Her interest seems to have positive feedback for engagement with it in the near future. That makes me wonder if she's interested in the shark because I'm interested in her when she's playing with it.  Am I looking at...   Her attachment to an object,  A sensation,  Or her attachment to me?   I think it could be useful to know if I am responsible for her habits like this or, if they're intrinsic.       "

463,What causes a Norman's lampeye to lose the ability to move it's tail fin?,"I have an aquarium with eight Norman's lampeyes (unfortunately 5 male, 3 female) and some other fish. Last Sunday I discovered that one of the Norman's lampeyes wasn't doing so well. She was nearly moving and floated near the surface of the water, head slightly down and tail slightly up touching the surface.  All other fish where fine.  Observed symptom:   Hanging near the surface of the water; Fast breathing, but not gasping for air; Not eating; Not using her tail fin; Swims head down tail up.   Other observations:   Does not roll to the left or right while swimming (not swimming slanted); Still responsive: reacts on fishnet and tries to escape, which goes pretty well.   Water quality and environment:  All water parameters are fine and did not change in the last weeks. The day before I discovered the sick fish I did a small 20% water change, which I do every 2 weeks.   Temperature: 24.2; PH: 7.4; KH: 6; GH: 3; Nitrite: 0.   Plants are growing fine, there is not much waste and I use liquid fertilizer. My tanks filtration is about 5 times an hour and lights are on for 9 hours a day. Algae growth is almost none, the algae that do grow are most of the time eaten by 5 shrimps (soon to be expanded by a pregnant one).  Both the water quality and environment did not change in the past weeks.  Feeding:  I feed two times a day. I try to feed small amounts, but I'm suspecting that I could feed them less. 2 times per week I feed them with frozen food.  Actions taken:  Because I didn't notice any disease that could possibly be cured with medicines I didn't use them. But I did add some salt (0.05 grams per liter 99.8% NaCl) to the water to give the fish a more friendly environment. This helps because the fish spends less energy getting salts out of his body (Osmosis etc.).  Two days later:  Now two days later the fish seems more alive and tries to eat when feeding. Also the breathing is way slower than before (back to normal). But the fish still swim without using the tail fin. Could it be paralyzed for good?  Questions:  What kind of disease could this be? What causes a tail fin to suddenly stop working?  I should notice that one of my other Norman's lampeyes misses an eye (ironically), I discovered this just after I got them from the pet store. But it seems that it doesn't bother the fish, he is doing fine.  Could these fish suffer from inbreeding?  "
464,What qualifies as animal abuse in the Netherlands?,"During the process of my divorce recently, I was told by legal workers that I could not claim the part of my salary that I've always used to take care of my dogs in the calculation of the partner alimony that I'd have to pay to my wife.  I created a petition about this here, with the whole story.   To me this means that they'll subtract money from my salary and give it to my wife, and my dogs will be totally disregarded when they do that. Like they don't exist. If I have no money left to take care of my dogs, I don't know what will happen to them. The best thing I can think of is giving them to an asylum. And then god only knows what they'll do to my senior dogs there.  I contacted the Animal protection organisation from the Netherlands and referred to this as animal abuse. They told me that this doesn't qualify as animal abuse. So when does it qualify as such? "
465,Indian Flapshell Turtle not eating,"I have a baby Indian Flapshell Turtle (Lissemys punctata), around 4-5 months old. I have observed that it has not been consuming its food for the last few days. It is playing fine inside water and also basking under sunlight.   Could the issue of not eating be due to the cold/winter here? Should I consult a veterinarian? "
466,Should I stop younger buddy cat from playing rough with older cat?,"We got a younger sweet cat (now 5!) for company for our older cat (almost 12!) because the older cat is very sweet and loving and loves other cat's company.  The younger cat has been the best companion for the older cat.  They've been together almost 4 years.  They've always played 'rough', and when the older cat was younger he engaged in rough play with other housemates.  However, lately, I notice that our older cat is becoming more and more sensitive to the rough play with the younger cat.  When the younger cat chases him and mounts him and bites him on the neck, our older cat starts wailing much more loudly than he used to.  This is also consistent with him being louder in general around feeding time; he used to be very quiet.  My question is: should I restrain the younger cat from this rough play when I am around?  I know older cats become more sensitive in their joints, etc., but I always thought the exercise and play would be good for him nonetheless.  I don't want to be stupid about it though and keep letting the younger cat have his way regardless of the older cat's feelings.    Any thoughts? "
467,Stray dog or fox?,"A neighbor on a local community message board is trying to locate the owner of this stray ""dog"" pictured below (Raleigh North Carolina area). She was reportedly a little timid at first but became super playful in a few seconds. The kids love  her but their dog seemed to really dislike her, but later also became friends.  I say this is a wild red fox.     Neighbors are arguing that this is not a fox but some type of terrier or some other arcane breed I cannot recall.  Is there any plausible breed this could be, i.e. not a fox? Any suggestions? "
468,Do betta fish attack snails?,"I had a small snail (about 1"" shell) in the same tank as my betta fish. They seemed to both be doing fine living together for the 7 months I've had them. But this week, I checked up on the tank and found the snail shell overturned. I tried flipping it upright but when I looked later it was flipped over again and looked empty :(  I had changed the filter and added water recently (2-3 weeks ago), but I've done water changes in the past and the snail was fine, so I don't see why it would have hurt the snail this time.  Do betta fish attack snails, and if so why might it have now? Or did the snail probably die of other causes? "
469,My dog will not accept meal from anyone other than me,"I have a dog mix, Jack Russel Terrier / Chihuahua, about 3 years old. I feed her meal which is a mix of kibble and can on her plate in the evening. I have begun to notice that she will only eat it if its me that sets her plate down. However when someone else in my family does it she leaves the plate there.  I assume this is a routine issue with her but I find it fascinating that she would go with hunger over a different plate setter.  I also assume the only way to correct this behavior is to go through a week of someone else other than me feeding her.  Anyone else see this behavior? Normal? I have had dogs before and this is the first I have seen of it. "
470,kittens are biting everything... literally,"SO my cats are excessive biters.  wall corners, the plastic window shades you have in most apartments, my metal towel holder, cardboard boxes, any food in plastic bags or wrappers on the counters such as a loaf of bread, and many of my electronic devices such as headphones and charging cables for my iphone, apple watch, and mac book pro.    I know when I got the kittens, they were very young at 4 weeks (yea that's a whole other story), and I have been waiting for them to grow out of this destructive phase (they have also destroyed some things like the cap to the side overflow drain in the bathtub) but it seems to be never ending at almost 9 months old now.  Even bit the glass lip off of my beer bottle while I was in another room.    I have tried everything from coating the wires in that bitter spray to providing them enough toys that it is a mine field to walk around.  They have dry food out 24/7 regulated by 2 small bowls that usually last them a little more than a day before I refill.  I do also feed them their wet food as well so they should be getting a balanced diet.  They don't scare very easily if at all.  Any attempts to clap or do pennies in a can doesn't even pique their interest as they continue the behaviors.  They are also extremely aggressive when I am eating food more so than any other cat I have had.  Usually after a few times of putting them down off the table or away from where ever it is I am eating, the cats will lose interest and walk off.  These 2 guys however, will try to ""outsmart"" me by coming at different angles, or different sides of the table, or come up behind other objects thinking I can't see them and it will turn dinner into a 15 minute game of keep away.  Is there something  more I can do? is this an issue I should talk to the vet about? I have previously brought it up to the vet while getting them their kitten shots but they kind of dismissed the subject or provided solutions I have already tried.  I have put wires I don't use away in a drawer where they cannot access it, but for my phone I charge over night, I have been waking up to them chewing on it in the middle of the night.  I don't want to lock them out of my bedroom but I also cannot have my phone where I won't hear it due to my job.  I would like to stop the behavior rather than just find a temporary solution like hiding the wires.  Would getting something like cat grass help?  dog chew toys?   Also to add... I have been using the spray bottle pretty heavily since they were young.  It is to the point all I have to do is show them it and they stop doing what ever it is they are doing.  They also know what they are doing is wrong because when I hear them up to something and they hear me walking into the room they are in, they instantly scatter.  So my cats are aware that when they are doing certain behaviors that a consequence is coming.  They just, try to get away with it like any other kid I suppose lol  But that is the other odd thing is that they are NOT afraid of water.  They practically shower with me every morning sitting on the side of the bathtub.  As far as what breed they are in case it matters, they were advertised as a maine coon mix that I adopted from a shelter.  However when taken to the vet, they are just short haired domestics and they do not show any physical traits of a maine coon anyways.  They are very loving playful cats.  Some of the most loving cats I have had.  My female loves to be cradled in my arms like a baby for hours while I am working at the computer and my male will often jump up and lay on my arm or curl up on the inner part of my arm if they are extended.  Both are very bonded to me and will follow me every where I go and my female even puts her paws on the side of my leg like dogs do when I come home from work.  Even my mom commented on how attached the cats are to me as well.  They really are great, cute, and friendly cats that everyone loves when ever they visit my place.  It's just this destructive kick they have that I don't know how else to put an end to it. "
471,"Dog snaps at me sometimes, problem?","I have a dog that's part Amstaff.  This is my first dog.  It is generally well behaved.  It is about 10 months old.  Sometimes the dog snaps at me.  For example, just now my face was near its stomach checking out a rash, and it snapped its mouth close to my face.  Not hard, and not actually on my face, but close to it.  It was annoyed that I was manipulating its body to get a look.  Might this indicate problem behavior?  If so, is it very bad (ingrained hostility), or something a trainer can fix? "
472,How to move a feral kitten from my bathroom to a cage?,"I recently rescued a feral kitten (atleast a couple of months) from my neighborhood about 3 days ago. When I captured him I just let him out  in my bathroom (from the cage I caught him in), without first taking him to the vet. :-/ well I'm noticing that his right eye is milky and am going to take him to the vet tomorrow. He's curled up behind my toilet. What is he least traumatizing way to get him from behind the toilet to a medium sized dog like cage? There's no way he's going to let me just pick him up and he hasn't eaten since I've trapped him (so luring him with food won't work). Does anyone know how I can get him to run in the cage without fully traumatizing him? P.S. He was eating the same food outside when he was free so it's not that he doesn't like the food, I think he's just too scared to eat it. Please help!! "

474,Dogs increasingly becoming picky and going to the bathroom in crate,"So I have 2 dogs (1 boy 1 girl) that are fixed and are 10 years in age. They are siblings and are miniature doberman pinschers mixed with maltese. My mother died last March and had been taking care of them while I was away at college (I'm 20). I moved into my own apartment with the dogs. The dogs have had separation anxiety since my mother died and are now crated together in a huge crate when I am not home or else they will howl and bark nonstop which is not okay in an apartment.   Since we have moved, they have gotten increasingly picky in their food and are disobedient. The male dog has lost a distressing amount of weight and has been checked out numerous times. There is nothing medically wrong with him. He always finished his food but was losing weight anyway. My vet recommended I switch them to a combination of prescription wet and dry food. After this, he seemed to gain weight for a short amount of time before the food made him nauseous and caused him to throw up and defecate in his crate overnight.   After this began, I switched them to a Beneful wet food and a dry food. He has been gaining weight since I switched them but I noticed that both dogs now refuse to eat their dry food at all. They will eat the wet food and pour out the dry food and proceed to urinate in the bowls and all over the crate. I know this could be seen as not going outside enough, but that is definitely not the case. I take them out when I get up in the morning (8am), when I get home from work or school (4:30pm) and then around dinner time (7pm). The dogs get fed and receive water at dinner time.   They have been urinating multiple times a day every day since I have returned from a 2 week vacation. The dog-sitter did not have this issue with the dogs and followed the exact same schedule as I did. So I guess my main questions are:   Are my dogs doing this (peeing in their food and water bowls) to spite me? They have no medical problems as I have gotten them evaluated multiple times in the last 2 or 3 months. How can I decrease their urination inside my home? They don't seem to care that they are peeing in their sleeping place and I can not place a pee pad because they will tear it up. Should I switch them to all wet food? They will refuse to eat for well over 24 hours if I just fill their food bowl with dry food and I do not want to starve them. They have not had any stomach problems with the wet food but the current portions I purchased are too small to be meals on their own. Am I doing something wrong? They were completely crate trained for the past decade and normally had no    Someone please help me! I've had these dogs for almost a decade and I do not plan on getting rid of them. But it's hard to come home from work everyday to a home smelling like urine and immediately get down on my hands and knees cleaning before I even get a chance to sit down. "
475,My kitten licks and nips my nose when he's snuggling with me.,"We rescued Reggie at 3 mths old.  Since I work from home, he is always near me and prefers me over my husband.  We have a bedtime routine which involves me cuddling and kissing his cheek.  He will cuddle close and lick the end of my nose.  Pretty cute, right?  Yeah.  The licks are always followed by him nipping me with his sharp little front teeth.  He's not aggressive by any means, but whyyyyyyyyy bite? If anyone has any insight on this, I'd love to hear. "
476,My dog tears up the towels I line her crate with,"Is this a behavior problem, or material problem?  Do I need to change what I line the crate with?  Or is she misbehaving?  She's not in the crate, most of the time.  I put her in there when I take a shower, or go out to the store.  Then she tears the towels to shreds! "
477,is it ok to persuade my cat to sleep off my bed (not on),"My cat has five sleep areas of her own that she uses; all of them designed to be comfy. She uses them all, but she likes to use my bed (a double bed) too. I really do not like to disturb her when she is sleeping on my bed, but have no choice sometimes.  When I turn in for the night, I have tried saying to her, several times ""catsname sleep, mummy sleep"" in the hopes that she will stay on the bed with me.  She dithers, and even stayed for a little bit once, but decided to jump off the bed.  As well as her other sleep areas, she has a donut bed in the bedroom which she uses from time to time. She likes to use all of her sleep areas.   Is she half-expecting to be disturbed when sleeping on my bed? I just hate disturbing her sleep. We live alone in a one bedroom flat.  Any thoughts? "
478,Why do some dogs dislike fluorescent clothing?,"My dog really doesn't like people or animals wearing fluorescent clothing.  I thought it was just my dog, but recently, whilst stuck on a motorway at night in the rain, following a crash, a policeman in full day glow overalls stuck his head next to the car and... well, the policeman remarked that it was common for dogs to dislike fluorescent clothing.  So the question that I would like to know is, why this might be?  I know dogs have different colour vision than humans, as represented in the below image:    Initially I was thinking that the fluorescence might appear particularly bright for them, (looking at the bright yellow 'band') and this was what dogs disliked.  But then I saw this image (below) to do with reflectance of fluorescent ink (fluorescence is occurring either end of the human visible spectrum) and it made me think, is it actually possible that rather than making things seem brighter, fluorescent clothing makes things almost disappear to a dog?  In such a scenario the dog is scared because they just see bits of objects moving not a complete picture.   "
479,What is the value of meat byproducts in cat food?,"I was watching a television commercial about a cat food that touts it's lack of meat byproducts and it's inclusion of ""real chicken meat"" presumably this is mostly lean muscle tissue. A related question Is there benefit to feeding my cats cat food that incorporates fruits and vegetables? addresses other ingredients in the product.    In the the wild a cat would eat the feathers, internal organs, etc; presumably these meet some of the cats nutritional needs.   What is the value of meat byproducts in cat food? "
480,How can I stop my hamster biting the bars of her cage?,"My hamster absolutely loves to bite the metal bars in her Rotastak enclosure. I know that this is to wear her teeth down but it's so annoying. How can I stop her from doing it? I have already tried giving her gnawing sticks, but she always goes back to the bars. :/  How can I stop her from gnawing on the bars? "
481,Is it possible to gut-load a mouse?,"When feeding insects to lizards, it's a common practice to gut-load them in order to deliver nutrients to the lizard. The diet of the insects can be altered to give them the highest possible nutritional value for the lizard.  Is it possible to do the same thing with a mouse? If I want to make sure a snake gets a good dose of calcium with it's food, could I feed the mouse calcium supplements a day or two before feeding it to the snake? Or will it not make any difference?  Is it possible to feed a mouse a special diet to give it the highest possible nutritional value for a snake?  I'm not assuming that the mice aren't sufficient by themselves, but a juvenile snake would benefits from vitamin and calcium supplements while it grows. Especially since juvenile mice have almost half of the calcium content that adult mice do (See page 12). Frozen mice purchased at the store are commonly injected with vitamins and supplements, so if I'm managing my snakes diet I could be missing out on those added supplements.  I would prefer not to have to try and feed the snake the supplements directly, coax it into eating a dusted mouse, or manage the dosages for supplement injections into the mouse myself. So I was wondering whether or not those supplements could be passed through the mouse's diet, similar to how it's done with insects. "
482,How can you tell if neck biting between dogs is too rough?,"We have two dogs.  One is a 4 year old male and the other is a new dog we adopted over a week ago who is a 2 year old female.  They are both the same breed (Alaskan husky) and roughly the same size.  So far, the dogs are getting along fairly well.  They've had a few fights but it's usually over bones and we're training them now to share.  My main concern now is about when they play.  They both enjoy playing, and when we watch them play, I do not see any signs in the female that she's not having fun (she doesn't look at us, she reengages when he lets up, no raised hair, etc.) but my male dog likes to bite her throat and push her around in circles on the ground.  Sometimes it looks like he is actually biting her throat very hard. On one occasion where the dogs were on a hard floor, I could actually feel my male dog's teeth grinding against the female dog's throat.  I read that if dogs are playing nicely, you should not break it up, but I am worried that my male dog is biting too hard.  How can I tell if he bites her neck too hard?  Should I break up their play when ever he bites her neck or should I continue to only look for the signs and let them play otherwise? "
483,Will neutering a male cat stop it from killing kittens?,"I just saw the question Facultative Cannibalism? on the biology web site, and I recalled hearing the tom cats, will kill house cat kittens.  Will neutering a male cat stop it from killing kittens it did not father? "
484,How can I transport my rabbit using a bicycle?,"I need to take my pet rabbit to the vet to get her spayed, but my main method of transportation is biking. How can I bring my rabbit on the bicycle without scaring her to death? Would she be okay in a bike carrier like the SleepyPod or should I seek alternate means of transport? She has been in a car before, but was in a cage rather than any sort of carrier. In the car she was afraid but after a while got used to it and didn't get a heart attack. "
485,Can you train a flea?,"I have seen old movies where there was a 'flea circus' I believe in modern times, most 'flea circus's use magnets or other mechanical means to move props, but I seem to recall seeing real fleas connected with hair to small wagons and such.  Can a flea actually be trained to perform in a 'flea circus'? If so what can they really do? "
486,How can I improve my DIY turtle food?,"So Ive concocted a food recipe for my turtle, and I want to make sure I have not missed or over added anything, below is a list of the constituents:   chicken(raw) turtle sticks some paprika 5 peas 3 long slices of carrot 2 corn 1 small bean pod 1 egg yolk as a binder  I put them in a blender and mixed them well, then put them in a zip lock bag and into the freezer.

489,My cat might have a bladder stone. What can I expect?,"I recently took my cat to the vet because he seemed to be having some discomfort with using the litter box. The doctor discovered some blood in his urine and wants to do an x-ray to see what's going on. He said it is likely to be a bladder stone. The other less common problem is a bladder disease that I cannot remember the name of. The x-ray is scheduled for the end of this week (8/8/2014).   Between now and then, the doctor advised me to provide him with an extra water bowl and change it more frequently. He's an indoor cat in a 2 bedroom apartment. He doesn't have far to go for it.  If it is a bladder stone, what sorts of changes will I need to make for my cat (diet, exercise, etc). He is approximately 5 years old and we got him at a shelter. Should I expect surgery of any kind? Does anyone know the approximate costs associated with this condition?  "
490,What could be the reason for my Schnauzer having a bluish eye?,"I have a miniature Schnauzer, who is 4 years old and in good health, but a couple days ago I noticed that his right eye is bluish and the left eye is normal (dark).  I took two pictures to compare them with each other:        I set up an appointment with a veterinarian, but in my city I was only able to get an appointment for Saturday, and I'm worried about his situation.  Is this something I worry about? Does it look like a cataracts disease, or maybe an eye injury?  What could cause his eye to be blue, and what can I do before his appointment with the veterinarian this weekend? "
491,How can I teach my dog to play fetch if she won't leave my side because she smells the reward treats?,"I have a dog who wants to chase bones.  I can take a bone and wave it in front of her and state, ""Who's got the bone?"" and she will yip and run after it if I throw it.  A bone is the ONLY thing she ever goes after.  She will pick it up, move it to somewhere near me, but not within reach, and chew on it for a minute.  Then she will leave it where it is and come to my side for another round of ""Who's got the bone?""  I am trying to teach her to fetch the bone and bring it back and I plan to reward her when she does.  Unfortunately, she smells the treats so she won't leave me alone when ""Who's got the bone"" is played.  She gets excited, but doesn't run.  I've tried walking over to the thrown bone with her and leaving a piece of treat, but she doesn't seem to ""get it"".  What am I doing wrong?  The dog plays nothing else and has shown no interest in any other toys or activities (beyond sleeping in the direct sun and rolling onto her back for tummy rubs) ever. "
492,How can I make my cat use her house during winter cold?,"My cat Catalina is 7~ months old, pretty healthy and playful.  I'm worried because the temperatures are dropping now and the inside of our house isn't really warm during winter at nights (15 degrees celsius, 59 farenheit). She sleeps at the sofa and when I wake up her fur and ears are cold, so I got her a fancy fluffy house about 50x50x50 cm on size and it looks good in relation to her size, she can move inside.  Now the issue is she doesn't sleep in her house, she keeps sleeping at the sofa and sometimes on the table. Should I worry, or are cats smart enough to use shelter if it is too cold for them? Can I do something so that she feels like using her house?  She isn't scared of her house or anything, she plays around it during the day and sometimes goes in randomly. "
493,"Freshwater aquarium - many fish batches dead, LFS keeps claiming that water is 'perfect'","Got a new 30 gallon aquarium ~1 month ago. The seller told me to use tap water (no conditiner), run the pump for a week (to get rid of chlorine), then bring a sample for test.  Did that, didn't use any soap/detergents for cleaning. All the rock/plants are from the same LFS.   One week later, brought the water sample for test, they said 'perfect' (1), gave me 6 tetra pristellas. Dummy me, came home, dumped everything in the aquarium.   One week later, 4 out of 6 still alive, another water sample, another 'perfect' (2) from LFS, a new group of fish (mollies, guppy, 1 gourami, 2 plecos - 9 total). Dumped them all again (really stupid). Mollies were really happy initially, one of them even gave birth.  Another week later, 9 fish dead, coming sad to the LFS, with another water sample, another 'perfect' (3). This time they sold me another 5 tetras (the remaining tetra 'is very sad, let's add compay') as well as 3 otocinclus, to keep raving algae in control. This time I made sure that the bag temperature is same as in aquarium, did partial water changes in the bag, topping it with the aquarium water. About ~45 minutes before releasing them.  Another week later, 4 tetra and 1 oto dead. Come to the same LFS, the water is 'perfect' (4) again, they even tested for P, PB and copper. Nothing. The readings were as previous:  Nitrate &lt; 5, Nitrite = 0, Total hardness - hard, Total chlorine - 0, KH - 40, pH - ~7.4.  Besides this, I have a liquid test at home, pH is always ~ 7.4, amonia/Nitrate/Nitrite - lowest value on the charts.   So, now I have 2 tetras and 2 oto, still alive but not very happy. Pump is rated for 50 gallons, always running. Temperature measured by 2 different thermometers - 79, maintained by 2 heaters rated for 25 gallons.   Sorry for long preamble - but what should I do now? I finally conditioned full aquarium (using stuff that's sold by LFS), thinking about getting a RODI filter - maybe the tap water has something not showing on the tests? Paying $250 for a full water test is a bit expensive.  P.S. Fish was always fed once a day, but all of them stopped eating after a days or two. "
494,What is that in my red-eared slider's wound?,"First Question  I have taken a photo of her wound today (see the first figure below). You can see there is a dark pink thing. Does anyone know what it is? Is it pus or a scab?  Second Question  This wound has already been there for almost a month. I had taken her to a vet for consultation since I discovered it. The vet offered me some cream and iodine to apply at home and asked me to take her back for antibiotic injection every three days for about two weeks. After all the things, the vet told me it is healing and no need to go back but I doubt it. I have a picture of the wound a month ago (see the second figure). Can any tell me if the wound is really healing?     "
495,Rottweiler vs Presa Canario vs Cane Corso vs Bull Mastiff: How to choose?,"I am trying to figure out why a person would choose one of the breeds above over the others. Any way I look at it the Rottweiler looks like the better option for about any task I can think of - smarter and more energetic than the other breeds yet just as big and protective as any of them.  And still people choose the other breeds sometimes, they are nowhere near going extinct.  What am I missing here? What are the advantages of the other breeds? "
496,Why does my cat lick her belly until sore?,"Hi I’m wondering if anyone can help me because I’m at a serious loss and I don’t know what to do. It’s really frustrating because I have been to the vets constantly over the past two years, to three different vets and nobody can tell me what’s wrong with her :(.   I believe after researching online that she’s participating in something called mowing. But all the pictures I’ve seen are no where near as bad as hers. She began grooming her back leaving bald patches like the mowing but she’s now moved to her belly and it gets so bad that as you can see in the picture, she will bite and cut herself. I have literally tried everything. She does not have fleas. Mites. Ringworm. Anything like that. The most recent visit to the vets ruled out any infection or parasites. They gave her steroid tablets but it’s done nothing to help her grooming. I’ve changed her food several times from when this started (although someone suggested wet food so I may give this a go). We’ve bought a special brush to help remove dead hair and skin so she doesn’t feel the need to groom as much but that hasn’t helped. Although we get little flakes of skin that look like dandruff come out, has anyone had an experience with this? Maybe it’s like a cat eczema or something? She’s settled, gets on with our other cat and there’s no reason she’d be stressed. We have treated her for this in the past, we were given meidication and it’s still happening. We’ve now had to result in putting a cone on until it scabs over and settles but it’s so horrible to see her like it.   I literally don’t know what else I can do. Every time I go to the vets they either don’t know, don’t find anything or subscribe her medication thats innappropriate and I don’t want to keep medicating her when it’s not an accurate diagnosis.   Any suggestions advise or experience would be HUGELY appreciated      "
497,why is my dog is always behind me?,"Why does my dog always sit BEHIND me? His bed is about 3 feet away diagonally from my gliding chair, but he will sit behind my glider always. If I leave the room he will sit in his bed or just follow me around and ALWAYS BEHIND me. ??? "
498,"One of my dogs harass my other dogs, even though they are submissive","I partially work with dog sitting and have a little pack of a handful dogs that I take care of a couple of days a week (that is, typically I have each dog 2-3 days per week, sometimes they are alone with me, sometimes I have a couple of them, but I have limited it to 3 simultaneous dogs because more than that is impractical when I take them for a walk).  One of these dogs is a 4-5 year old neutered male shelter dog that very much looks and behaves like a jack russel terrier. Let's call him B.  B was the second dog I started to take care of, before him I had A, a eurasian bitch that I have had since she was 4,5 month old (A is now 1.5 years old).  Unsurprisingly A was submissive to B and everything was fine (A is very submissive when meeting dogs in the dog park, spending most of her time on the back, never causing any troubles). After a couple of month A and B had a one or two fights, nothing serious (i.e., no blood or so but some growling, baring the teeth and some attempted bites). Suddenly A was dominant and B was submissive to A.  After these incidents, B suddenly become very affectionate towards me and my girlfriend. Sometimes we deliver B to his owner somewhere outside (rather than she comes by here and pick him up which is the normal procedure) and he always refuse to walk away with his owner on these occasions and show all signs of unhappiness when I leave (he is very happy to see his owner, it is just that he can't bear that I leave).  After a while I also got a male pomeranian, C, that is of approximately the same age as B. Still no problem. C is quite reserved and doesn't care about me nor other dogs. C is chemically neutered. Only time he shows happiness is when he is picked up by his owners in the afternoons. Still no problems. A, B and C get along well as long as I serve them their food a bit apart.  However, recently I got two more dogs, a male shiba puppy, 4-5 months old, D, as well as a female dachshund, 1,5 years old, E.  Now the problem started: D and E are submissive to B but he is not satisfied with that and harasses them so much that they are scared of both him as well as going through my door when their owners leave them in the morning. Especially D suffers from severe bullying by B and B frequently snap at him, which, not all the time but at least once a day, makes D scream and show all signs of being very scared (shivering, hiding in a corner near the door, focusing all his attention on B and so on).  So far, B has not (AFAIK) ""punched hole"" in D's skin when he has snapped him. Of course we have examined D after these attacks but ""squeezing"" D, moving his joints, examining face and ears and similar has never revealed any wounds or painful spots, although he has been limping for a short while once or twice after such an incidents.  Of course, I roar at B immediately after every incident which makes him roll over on his back, avoiding eye contact with me and show all signs of being submissive.  Generally B has no problems with other dogs when we are in the dog park. He doesn't play that much with other dogs but when other dogs run around in groups he kind of herd them by running behind, barking and trying to snap their hocks (but there has never been any incidents where he has injured the playing dogs he chases like this).  However, during the year I have had B has three times bitten humans. Twice men in their 60s, once an lady in her 80s. B's owner says he has a problem with slightly overweight men in their 60s and both of the male victims above matched that description. Remember, B is a shelter dog. It wouldn't be surprising if he has been abused by men matching that profile.  All these three attacks has been at the heels or calfs. Twice the person wore jeans, once the victim had bare legs. The bite didn't punch hole in the jeans and the man with bare legs only got a very shallow scratch on his skin (like you can do on yourself with your nails). Of course, biting humans, even though the bite is not very severe, is not acceptable behaviour from a dog but he doesn't seem to bite to injure the victim. However, these attacks has all completely unexpected. We have been walking down a crowded road and he just ignores everyone we meet until he suddenly attacks (we frequently go by public transport and he has no problem with that, he mostly sits or lays around my feet ignoring everyone around).  Furthermore, B's owner told me, after I told her about the first incident with D, that B doesn't like puppies. But obviously all puppies are not a problem - A was a puppy when they first met and B has no problems with most puppies in the dog park.  When it comes to E, B is not physical towards her, he just dominates her and forces her out of his way into a corner somewhere. When I have B, D and E together, unless I intervene, D and E end up in a corner near the door clearly very tensed and nervous.  I have tried going out somewhere where we are alone in the nature and release them all together to give them plenty of time and space to figure out their hierarchy but nothing ""happens"": B just hangs out quite close to me waiting for us to be ""done"" while D and E take the chance to sniff around and play with each other.  So what is behind B's aggressive behaviour towards D and E? And how can I make them get along?    Response to @Elmy's very well written comment:  Thank you for your views. Especially the first one made sense. We had kind of interpreted the situation as B, when A raised in the hierarchy, wanted to be ""on good footing"" with us since he was lowest in the rank. Does that make sense? If B is below A we thought he felt us humans could protect him from A if the need arose and to achieve that he become affectionate towards us.  Anyway, yes he probably guards and protect us when around other dogs. But, when we are in a dog park, he is not as close as you suggest: typically he is a few meters away but he is very attentive to when we are about to leave and immediately follow us when we start moving. He clearly does not want to be left alone (maybe due to his life in a shelter). The other dogs act more ""natural"" here and want to stay and have fun and therefore have to be called in.  Can you elaborate on how I tell him to stay behind [me]? Do you mean when he is on leach or when he is off leach?  Of course I don't justify his biting, especially not when he attacks humans [1] . However, the shelter dog information seemed important to include when analyzing the situation. A dog that has always been treated good and bites is different from a dog that has been abused and bites.  What do you mean by ""too late""? My reaction is within a few seconds, the attack might still be ongoing when I react. However, I don't spend my days watching every step my dogs take so, unless I provoke an attack, it would be sheer luck if I could see it beforehand. Your suggestion seems unrealistic.  That doesn't mean being mean to any dog and constantly putting them on their back. It means setting the rules and controlling that everyone followes the rules. Make it a rule that noone is allowed to overly dominate someone else.  How do I achieve this? When B is with A and C he is very nice and calm, both to them and to me and has no problems if I play with A and C or they are in my knee, I serve them food or something. And B is still very nice towards me when D and E are around so I am not sure how I can construct a situation where B and I would have a ""dominance competition"". The only thing I can imagine is if I play with B and give him something to pull and drag. I always end these games by ""winning"" and taking the toy.  Regarding the last advice: yes, I always ""double"" the leach (= the length is halved) when walking around among people but sometimes unexpected things happens (The last attack on a human happened when we had been swimming from some rocks. I had him in his leach when we climbed out of the water on some slippery rocks but fell and lost the leach.).  [1] In between dogs some biting is acceptable, isn't it? The other dogs in my pack sometimes tumbles around playing and everyone is content and happy. Afterwards you can see that they are all greasy around the neck from ""soft"" bites in each other furs. One of them is white and has ""flappy"" ears and from time to time you can even see a small pink ""stains"" in his fur on the ears, probably a minuscule amount of blood when someone by mistake scratched him a little too hard. I have never heard him scream or anything like that so I guess it is just accidents that doesn't bother him that much. Anyway, this has nothing to do with B. "
499,"When and why do dogs ""stop liking other dogs""?","When I walk my dogs I frequently meet other people with dogs that say that my dogs can't greet their dog because their dog doesn't like other dogs.  This claim always baffles me. Dogs are pack animals and live their first weeks or months of their lives with, typically, a handful of siblings that they play and interact with, expressing a lot of joy and happiness over the company.  How come they suddenly forget that experience and start going against their nature and dislike other dogs? Or are their owners projecting their own fear and nervousness on their dogs?  Of course, they grow up and are not as playful anymore (one of my dogs mostly ignore other dogs but if a dog come up and sniff him he justs ignores the sniffing dog and moves on with his business, no harm done) but going from there to actively disliking other dogs is quite a big step. How and why does this happen? "
500,"What is a polite way to ask ""What breed is your pet dog? Or what kind of mixture if he's a mixture?""","When someone tells me they have got a pet dog, I am always interested in what kind, whether that means which breed, or what overall group (terrier, sheepdog), or what mixture if he is a mixture. But there is a danger of offending people, of conveying an impression of snobbery (with ""What breed is he?""), perhaps with condescension (with ""What breed is he? Or what mix, if he's a mix?"").  What is a polite and respectful way to ask? "
501,What should I have in my chameleon enclosure?,"I have a 6 month old Yemen Chameleon, she is doing well and is perfectly healthy. In my enclosure I have a large log that goes diagonal from one corner to the other. I then have leaves wrapped around them. I also have a water bowl at the bottom (even though I've seen online that they don't need one but the shop keeper insisted). My enclosure is 1.5ft by 3ft, it seems pretty empty and I want to add more stuff in but I don't know what.  I guess what I'm trying to ask is, what else could I add to my enclosure without it being crammed? What do chameleons like in their enclosures? "
502,Betta fish eating but stays at tank bottom,"About 2 months ago I saw the fins on my elephant ear betta were tearing but I was told that it was not fin rot. He was swimming and active and eating but now he lays at the bottom only coming up to eat. I do a water change every week, 30-40%. The tank has a heater set to 78F and a filter changed every 4 weeks. Thought? Is he dying? "
503,Does a goldfish experience feelings of loneliness?,"My goldfish has been the lone fish in her tank for a number of months now, and quite recently, has begin to behave differently and remain in one small area on the very bottom of her tank.

506,What should I look for in a dog if my family is allergic?,"My partner and I are interested in adopting a dog or cat, but unfortunately, both of my parents have various animal allergies, and we want to make sure they would still be able to visit our home. Since cats are covered by this question, this question is specifically about dogs.  In reading about hypoallergenic dogs, it seems that this whole idea is a myth:     However, prominent allergen researchers have claimed that there is no basis to the claims that certain dog breeds are hypoallergenic and, while allergen levels vary among individual dogs, the breed is not a significant factor.   We have a small home (two rooms), so permanently isolating the dog to one room isn't feasible. I've seen the usual advice about frequent baths, cleaning, etc. but what should we look for in a dog to minimize the conflict with allergies? Contrary to the link above, are there specific breeds we should look for? Characteristics of the fur/hair, or something else?  The Mayo Clinic recommends smaller dogs instead of larger dogs, since they'll shed less, but they don't have much to say on the dogs themselves, and instead focus on other ways to improve the environment.

508,Is a dog's understanding of a person's tone instinctual or learned?,"It's clear that dogs are very good at picking up on the tone and emotion of the people around them, but I'm wondering if this is something that is instinctual or learned based on previous experiences.  I found an article in Psychology Today that touches a bit on this, but it doesn't exactly answer the cause of a dog's knowledge. For example, would a stray dog that hadn't been in contact with humans before be able to tell if a person was happy or angry? Or is this something that pet dogs pick up through classic conditioning while living among humans? "

510,How can I prevent my cat from developing pressure sores on his legs?,"Hunter (our 11 year old neutered male with a heart condition diagnosed this summer) has developed a small wound on one of his hind legs. This summer he started spending more time laying on the hard tile floor. He has also lost a lot of weight since being diagnosed with the heart condition.  I believe that the wound is a pressure sore from his (now bony) legs resting on the hard tile floor for hours at a time. I cleaned and bandaged it. If it begins to worsen or does not improve I will immediately take him to the vet, but stress from the vet worsens his heart condition, and our normal vet is unfamiliar with this heart condition (restrictive cardiomyopathy - our normal vet has only ever seen one other case before). I am currently waiting for a callback from his cardiologist.  Is there another surface that I can provide for him that will be cooling (the reason I think he's laying on the tile) but isn't as hard on his body? Or, would it be reasonable to keep both hind legs bandaged to provide some extra padding on the bones? (this is the type of bandage we're using) "
511,Is my betta aggressive? Can she share a tank with other bettas or mollys?,"A few months ago I had a male betta (separate tanks) pass away. I had him since I was 9, I'm currently 20.   So eight months ago I adopted my fifth betta. A veiltale female. Violet.   My mom and grandma BOTH gave me bettas for my birthday (a few weeks ago). I considered doing a female sorority. All are the same breed, the two newbies got along but violet, instantly flared and would corner them. I pulled her out and didn't try again.   They are both in 5 gallon tanks. I just got three mollys. I put her in and it was fine until one got too close. Now all she does is flare. It's been less than 3 hours. Is it okay to put her in the tank with the mollys?  I had her floating with them before to adjust. Both are in a new 10 gal tank. She is currently separate by a breeder, she still flares at that one molly. What do I do? Should I separate them and put her in my extra ten gal? Or try at one of my other younger bettas? I feel abusive leaving her in the breeder. Please help.  "

513,How to stop cat attacks,"I have a eight year old cat who has never shown any sign of aggression until the last six months or so. There have been no household changes during that time period.  The first attack happened when I was sitting on the bed and found a large spider about to crawl up my pajama shorts. I screamed. When I did, the cat hurled himself at my head three times in a row. He gouged a ding about an eighth of an inch long across the lens of my glasses. By the third attack, my husband was able to grab him, toss him (gently) from the bedroom, and shut the door. That was his first and worst attack. All attacks have taken place in the bedroom and they have all taken place in the evening.  A couple more head attacks like the first passed. However, last night, while I was straightening the bed covers, he attacked my hand. He punctured one of the main veins in the back of my hand with his teeth with a gruesome result.  This does not seem to be a ""play"" response at all. I tussle with him often enough: he likes to lie on his back and he holds his claws in and he pretends to bite my hand and beat off my wrist with his back legs while I scratch his chest. This is not that.  He has been seen recently by the vet for a regular checkup and is well.  The only factor I can think of is that the cat has the run of the bedroom during the day, but is closed out at night because he disturbs our sleep. He is not lonely at night, he has a cat buddy to hang out with. I wonder if he gets aggressive at night because he knows he's going to get booted off the bed and he's being possessive of the bed somehow.  Question: Why is my cat attacking me so viciously after several years of peace? Do cats get curmudgeonly with age? What is the appropriate human response, besides removing him from the scene of the crime? I would like him to stop entirely, but anything that could lessen the frequency would be welcome as well. "
514,Dog running away with toy,"I have searched this site and didn't find a question with the specific issue we're facing.  We've tried to teach our dog fetch and came across an issue we didn't know we we're having prior to this and since then have noticed it's not a problem related to fetch training itself. Our dog (7 year old Lab mix... Or shepherd... Or anything really) will go after the ball and get it. She does then run our direction when called but takes a turn just in front of us. After that she will lay down and chew the ball making sure she keeps a certain distance to us. Most times we have to pretty much ""corner"" her to get close. We are certain that's because she doesn't want to give up the ball. However she displays no signs of aggression, anger, fear or excitement during the process. Once we get a hold of her she gives up the ball easily when we grab it (we don't pull or anything, she let's go when we touch it). Also later we noticed that when we proceed the walk and she has the ball to carry she does not respond when recalled as long as she has the ball.   Additional info:  She loves chewing more than anything but that's not a suitable activity for walks and I'd like to have her running and be involved in play time when on a walk. She has a chew toy available at home that she has access to 24/7 (and I'd like to keep it that way). Giving up the chew toy is not a problem at all. However she won't fetch that either but drop it when called.  She is not obsessed with toys. She will let us know she wants the ball when we have it but doesn't do so in an excessive way and is fine when she doesn't get it. The ball is something special for weekend walks and is otherwise out of her reach because she will chew it up and destroy it.  We have tried multiple things such as:   Reward her with a treat when she gives up the ball (after cornering her) or offering a treat in return for the ball; she won't take the treat cause the ball is more important.  Don't bother her at all when she has the ball (no recall and nothing); she will come closer to us and lay down there but still keeps a certain distance. no recall but walk up to her and put her on the leash to continue the walk not ""mentioning"" the ball at all; no effect at all visible the next times we tried making ourselves more interesting by backing off from her after calling her... Cheering, clapping.... The whole thing; it worked two times until she understood the concept.   Actual question:  How do I get my dog to stop walking away with the ball considering the approaches we've tried? And in addition to this (same issue so probably the same answer) how do I make sure she responds when I recall her when she has the ball? "
515,Cat has bad tooth and won't eat but vet won't remove tooth if she isn't eating,"My cat has a very bad rotten mouth with an abscess. We noticed about 5 days ago when she stopped eating, and so we took her to the vet twice. She got a shot of antibiotics and painkillers that we give her twice a day, and both visits she also got an injection of fluids since she won't drink either.  The vet who will remove her bad teeth says that we must get her to eat to be healthy enough for the tooth extraction which is booked for 7 days away.  She is now at 5 days without food and I am very concerned. She wants to eat and has tried numerous times to eat soft food, but every time she will hiss and run away as if it causes her a lot of pain, even with the painkillers.  I am wondering how much longer she can go without food before we need to take drastic action. I have heard that force feeding an animal is bad for them, is that true? To get a feeding tube might be more than I can afford but I don't know what to do. How much longer should we wait to see if she eats? What can we do if she can't eat?  Edit- wanted to share the results in case anyone else has a similar problem. After she continued to not eat we got her into the vet the very next day as an emergency. She had a calcified lump that was preventing her from closing her mouth fully, so that explained why she couldn't eat. She was in a bit of pain after the removal, but by the next day she was eating just fine. So it seems if a cat isn't eating because of a bad tooth/abscess in their mouth, get it removed as soon as possible. If it is really bad there is no point waiting for antibiotics. She is doing so much better especially since she was otherwise healthy. "
516,Changing out aggressive fish species?,"My husband and I ""adopted"" a 55 gallon tank that came with a number of fish, including 2 angelfish and 7 black skirt tetras.  Unfortunately we've been having an issue with both species: the angelfish either fight like crazy (liplocking, nipping, etc.; the female had an infected eye when we took her in and is now blind thanks to him), harass everyone in the tank, or lay a bunch of eggs (they usually eat them all so at least we don't have a ton of babies, but they get very territorial with the others when this happens) and the black skirts have started aggressively fighting (they usually would play together, looked a lot like tag, but now they're actually causing harm to each other).  We have been seriously considering rehoming them and getting new fish, but we weren't sure what would be compatible in our tank?  The other fish we have are: 4 neon tetras, 4 cory catfish, and 1 pleco.  The angels are the only ones picking on anyone outside of their own species, in fact everyone else gets along really well!  If we did switch out the angels and BST, are there any more colorful AND peaceful options we could look into?  We already plan on getting more neons since their school is so small at this time, but right now they're the only spot of color in a sea of silver and black. Thanks in advance for any advice you may have for us! :) "
517,"My Puppy started peeing in the crate, what should I do to make sure she doesn't pick up the habit?","We've had the puppy 5 days, which makes her 9 weeks old.  She has slept in the crate every night with very little whining.   Today was the first time she has peed in the crate and it was in the middle of the day when we only put her in for 1 maybe 2 hours at a time.   She goes out side to potty right after eating/drinking and again 30 minutes after, as well as when she wakes up from a nap.    The kennel is pretty big but we have a box in back to she doesn't have much room.  Though when she curls up in a ball she only takes up about half the room she has.  We can't move the box up any more or she won't have enough room between the box and the crate door to sit down.    Have we don't anything wrong?

I recently brought 2 kitten siblings(2 months old) .  Now when the older kitten sees these 2, she runs away and doesn't come back for hours.   So few questions here are:  i) How do I gain that feral kitten's trust so that I can pet her and hold her?  ii) Why isn't she ready to get picked even when she's been staying and eating at our place since 3 months (She comes close only to eat and then goes and sits in the carton box)?   iii) How do I make her friendly with the new kittens?

521,How to cure kitten whose eye is closed and dripping with puss?,"The feral kitten at our home who doesn't like to get picked up or held and runs away when we try to do so has hurt herself. I don't know exactly what happened but I think that something pricked her eye or so. Initially her eye had developed a red layer at side and it was bleeding. Now it has converted into puss which keeps dripping and her eye is almost closed. She is trying to open her eye but she's unable to do it. It's really hurting to see her in that condition but when I try to hold her to take her to vet she gets scared and runs away.   So the questions here are:  i) Is it some medical condition that has caused her this red eye and puss or is it due to some accident?  ii) Is there any way I can try to cure it without holding her ( like putting some medicine in milk or something like that)  iii) If not, then how do I hold her to take it to vet ?

523,Is my hedgehog too agressive?,"I recently obtained a female albino hedgehog from her previous owners. They weren't that fond of the hedgehog and didn't socialize her well during the ~8 months they had her (they got her at ~1-2 months of age). They didn't take her out much, didn't play with her - basically, she stayed in the cage 99% of the time with them.  So, the hedgehog is ~10 months old, hasn't been socialized well, and is quite aggressive towards me.  I have had her for 2.5 weeks now. During that time I took her out every evening (after she woke up) and let her get used to my presence, noises that I make, etc. She spends about an hour outside of her cage, mostly playing freely on the sofa. For about 20-30% of the time, I try to interact with her by picking her up, trying to play with her. Every time I take her out, I give her a treat that she likes and eats eagerly.  Although she became slightly less aggressive for that time, she is still quite easily startled by me, doesn't let me touch her at all (unless I have picked her up forcefully), and mostly curls up into a ball when I am holding her.  Is this normal behavior? Can I expect the hedgehog to become more accustomed to my interaction if I continue trying to socialize her? What time-frames could I expect for a change in the behavior? "
524,What makes a treat only suitable for a certain age range?,"About a month ago I bought a bag of treats for my puppy (cracker-like, bone shaped). But when I got home I discovered that the bag said it was suitable for puppies 6 months old and older.  I don't mind storing the treats for some time (until he's 6 months old) but it got me thinking:  What makes a treat only suitable for a certain age?  I would assume nothing there would be toxic, but perhaps something in the ingredients is hard to digest for a young stomach? "

526,How to efficiently catch my own fish?,"I recently performed some maintenance on my tank which required me to move all of my fish from one tank to another holding tank for a short period of time.  The most difficult part of this entire process was successfully capturing the fish before and after the maintenance. I figured I must be missing some kind of trick or technique which led me to ask:  What is the best way to catch my fish with minimal stress for them?  I used a few different techniques to eventually catch them all but it took a while. The techniques I tried were:    For anything with spikes / spines (Bristlenose Catfish etc) I used a jug to transport them in because I didn't want them to catch their spines in the net. On the whole, this worked well but would be harder with faster, smaller fish. I used a largish net to catch the tetras (cardinal / rummy nose) and most were relatively easy with a bit of corralling.  The most difficult to catch were the Zebra Loaches which seemed both suitably fast and clever to completely outwit me. The net I used was almost as wide as the tank but they were seriously impressive in their evasion attempts.    My primary concern is stressing the fish out. I don't want to endlessly chase them around the tank because I don't think it does anyone involved any good. I deliberately caught the fish which is normally quite jumpy (Opaline Gourami) first so I had the element of surprise. After a few fish had been taken out, the rest knew what was happening and upped their game.    Additional Thoughts:   I could probably have drained more water out of the tank. It was still about 1 third full so there was room for them to evade me still. I tried to balance 'sufficiently gentle' and 'fast enough' so maybe I need to go for more speed?  "

530,Protecting my kitten against rabies after fighting with feral cats,"I live in Pakistan, and we own a three months old Persian breed kitten. It had aggressive interactions with other feral cats who secretly sneaked into our house. I don't think that my cat was injured because I can't see any sign of any injury or bleeding. Moreover, there is no evidence that the cats that attacked my kitten were rabid. Cats fight with each other over places where food is available. However, I still would like to remove any risk of extremely horrible diseases like rabies. I am planning to visit a vet. But, since Pakistan is a third world country, I would like to get some advice from folks out there who live in western countries. I have the following questions:   Do cats or other pets also get rabies immunoglobulin just like humans? Since I live in a third world country like Pakistan, how can I make sure that the rabies vaccination is not counterfeit? Is there any other way to find out rather than asking the vet? How many doses of anti-rabies vaccination would my cat get on the first visit to vet? Should one trust government pet hospitals in third world countries like Pakistan?  "
531,Would my fish benefit from snails in their pot pond?,"""How do I know if there is too much algae in an outdoor fish pond or pot?"" tracks the potential issues with too much algae in my fishes environment.

The walls have algae, which is hard to see, unless the sun is shining through one of the pots in the morning, as the pots are painted black (on the outside).

Should I use regular silicone for this ""hot"" repair, or might it harm the fish? "
539,Cats fight over who sleeps further up on the bed,"I have 2 cats, who enjoy sleeping on the bed with my wife and me, but during the night we notice that they both start at the foot of the bed, and creep up, leapfrogging each other to be higher up and closer to our heads. This occasionally erupts into fights, over what I can only assume is their position on the bed.  My question is, is this normal behavior? Is one cat trying to assert dominance over the other one by their position on the bed?  Background on the cats: Male(neutered) 1.5 years old, female(spayed) 6-7 months old. Get along seemingly okay except for some altercations (see this question). "
540,Are there health risks to leaving a dead fish in the aquarium?,"Sometimes one fish dies, without any apparent disease. In previous aquariums I would always remove them as fast as I could.  Now my aquarium is a bit bigger, and I have some laziness to remove those bodies: they are to deep, or in the back, or partially eaten. So I decide to leave some, and they tend to disappear in few days.  Is there any safety issues by doing that? Will other fish die if they eat dead fish? Will they develop some mad fish disease ?  Sometimes, after you have a established aquarium, with everything working as it should, fish might die simply because they get old, or have a shorter life-span due to its condition before being sold to you, or because some other fish had a fight with it.  If only one fish died, without white / black spots, no sign of fungus or parasites, no alteration in the gills, I usually rule out diseases of environmental problems. "
541,What are good techniques for coping with the loss of a dog?,"There is a unique connection between dogs and their owners. But eventually, this connection must be broken. What are some techniques for coping with losing a beloved friend (dog)? Is it a good idea to buy another dog to comfort you? "
542,Can I give my cat human medicine?,Is it safe for me to use human medicine on my cat?  Are there occasions where it is OK to give my cat human medications? 
543,Do invisible fences pose long term health risks to dogs?,I know that invisible fences work by giving the dog a shock through his/her collar when they get near the fence. Is this shock dangerous to dogs? Can repeated exposure cause long term health risks?  I also know that some of these invisible fences use ultrasound. Is this harmful to dogs? Can repeated exposure to ultrasound cause long term health risks? 
544,How often should a hermit crab tank be cleaned?,"I have three pet hermit crabs, and they live in a 10 gallon fish tank. How often should I clean this hermit crab tank? How often should the sand be replaced? "
545,Is styptic powder OK to use after it gets damp?,"After trimming my dogs' nails, I accidentally left the jar of styptic powder open overnight. During that time, it absorbed some water from the atmosphere so that the top layer is slightly damp and clumps together. I'm concerned that having some water in the styptic would allow bacteria to grow.  Is this slightly damp layer still safe to use on my dogs? If not, what about the powder that was underneath the surface layer that is still dry? Can I do anything to dry it out like heating it gently for a time? "
546,Does neutering have any negative effect on the health of a dog?,"After asking Can a dog contract a sexually transmitted infection?, I want to advise my friend to neuter his dog and I want to do the same with my own dog.  I want to ensure my dog is still safe, so I want to know if neutering my dog will affect his health negatively.  Will neutering have any negative health effects (or any negative effects at all) on my dog?  My dog is a Male mixed breed around 10 years old. "
547,How can I identify a pet bird that will be able to mimic human speech?,"How is it that certain birds are able to mimic back what humans say to them? It would take not only the vocal cords, but some level of intelligence to comprehend what we are saying. Dogs are able to understand what we say to a large enough level to respond with the appropriate action - such as sit - but they never talk back. Is there a difference in the vocal cords of some birds that permits them to speak back to us? "
548,How can I prevent cutting my dog when clipping his nails?,"After reading Is styptic powder OK to use after it gets damp? , I wondered why people would use such a product. For some animals there may be health conditions that would cause nails to bleed when clipping, but for the purposes of this question, I am referring to a healthy dog.  I much prefer the idea of not cutting my dogs nails so deeply as to draw blood.   What techniques are there to help prevent cutting the quick in dog's nails?   Does it cause damage or pain to a dog when cutting into the quick?    "
549,Can Acid Water Fish Live In Alkaline Water?,"Can acid water fish live in alkaline water?  For example, my tank Ph is around 7,5 because its substrate is made of dolomite. I basically have molly and platys, but I wanna have other kind of fish.  For example, I'd like tetra (neon) cardinal, or some big fish from Amazonian Bay(I can get they easily here in Brazil). These fish Ph will be around 6 and 6.8.   I think I can put some tree trunk in order to turn the water more acid. In the last case, I should change substrate (more painful).  Will acid water fish die in alkaline water, if so, why? "
550,My usually very quiet and calm cat started biting me?,"My cat NEVER has bitten me in the nearly 10 years I have had him but today he got very angry and starting batting at me, biting and meowing (which he also rarely does). He is an outside/inside cat, maybe that has something to do with it? Should I call the vet ASAP? "
551,Cat scratching her face and head,I have a 12 year old DLH Calico. She has been scratching at her chin on and off over the years. I treat her for fleas and worms regularly and have visited the vet on multiple occasions and they don't seem concerned. She has now started scratching at her face and the top of her head that she is bleeding and scabbing. My cats are fed nutrisource dry food. Could this be cause by stress or a food allergy? Even if I have t changed her food? Should I conult in a different vet?! 
552,puppy hates collar and leash,"We just bought a 5 month old puppy, it's been a week and I think I may have rushed the collar and leash training as the puppy can't walk straight with the collar on and frequently shakes her head and scratches at the collar. It's a very soft collar with a light name tag.  How long does it typically take a puppy to accept a collar? A leash?   Once the leash is on, she refuses to walk anywhere and puts on the breaks. I let her wear and drag the leash around a bit indoors to get her used to it, but as soon as I pick up the other end, she refuses to comply. Without the collar on she frolicks and plays and wants to get into all sorts of mischief like eating rocks and biting at branches. With that in mind, I'd prefer she were on a leash.  Should I try to find a thinner collar and start over from the top? Thanks! "
553,Why does my cat meow a lot more since moving?,"I've moved from a two bedroom apartment into a two storey house. My cats have a lot more room to roam around in. My older cat meows a lot more now. He almost never did before.   When he does it, he does it over and over for minutes at a time. It's a throaty or guttural meow and it sounds somewhat anxious, at least that's how it makes me feel when I hear him. He seems to like to carry his cat toys around when he's doing it though, so do I take that as a sign that he is content?   I'm not sure how I should interpret his new sounds. Any ideas? "
554,I'm looking at adopting a cat that had Basal Cell Carcinoma,"I would like to adopt a cat with Basal Cell Carcinoma.  The shelter's vet removed the tumor and had it tested, it was benign.  As far as they know the cat is cancer free now, am I assuming more risk by adopting this cat?  Is this cat more likely to have cancer than any other cat? "
555,Is it normal for a feral cat to let me pet him/her?,"There is a very cute feral cat in our old home (its next to our new one). Almost 2 weeks ago, I started feeding it everyday. In the last few days, it started to rub me and even allowed me to pet here.  What I noticed:   Purring. When I try to pet gently, its turn his head very quickly and sometimes raises his hand (I got a very little scratch :D). No hissing, it follows me everywhere.   My question is:  Since the cat is allowing me to pet him. Is there a way that I can attract it to live/sleep in a better place? Also, how can I estimate it's age? I want to get some blankets for it but not sure how to let him understand that.  By the way, I'm 100% sure this is a feral cat, since in my community people don't care about pets that much.    Thanks, "
556,Why is a biological denitrification filter considered cheap to build and operate?,"I found more than one (old) websites (in German) ([website]My research concludes that one needs a redox sonde for about 150 €, a dosage pump for another 60 € (and you probably want to spend double for some basic quality) and a potentially complex chain of filter chambers (not expensive, but not free neither) in order to avoid bacteria duff. The danger of the filter producing extremely smelly sulfuric products is omnipresent and makes it difficult to leave the filter unattended during vacation - or requires electronical regulation hardware which will cost a multiple of the basic setup described above.  A anion exchange granulate-based filter for a 600 l aquarium cost 150 € (or 500 € for 2500 l) and requires recharging every x weeks in boiling water for half an hour. The granulate lasts about 10 years; seporax, the filter media in biological filter, will certainly last longer, but some wearout will happen to it over the time, I assume. The filter shouldn't stop running, but the granulate isn't damaged as long as water flows through it, no matter how much nitrate it contains or whether it's charged or not.  I don't see the point. Am I missing something? Did the conditions/prices change over time (the second link estimates the cost at 800 DM for a 700 l aquarium which is ~400€)? Or did I just hit two pages based on superficial research? "
557,Would it be safe to use the offspring of wild crickets as food?,"So feeding wild insects to reptiles is bad because they could carry nasty things like parasites or pesticides. But would it be safe if I caught some of them, bred them, and kept the offspring separate from the wild caught crickets? I would imagine that would be enough to get rid of the risk of pesticides, but would it get rid of parasites? Are there other risks  that can be passed on from the crickets to their eggs? "
558,How do you calculate the terrarium size needed for a lizard?,"The Backstory:  Complete pet newbie here, so bear with me please. A good friend of mine has a bearded dragon and asked me to look after it for a couple days while he was out of town. I'm the type of person that likes to approach any situation armed with as much knowledge as possible, so naturally I did some reading on bearded dragons. I've never owned any pets before and had never had much desire to, but I found that I enjoyed just watching his bearded dragon eat and ... glare at everything. A bit more research later and I discovered that lizards and other reptiles are relatively low maintenance, compared to say, a dog or cat. Which brings me to...  The Plan:  I'm seriously considering getting a small- to medium-sized lizard, and building a habitat for it (I'm a semi-pro craftsman). I have a limited amount of wall space in my house to put a vivarium up against, so I was considering a floor-to-ceiling design, with live plants inside. The dimensions of the enclosure I'm envisioning would be about 36"" wide, 26"" deep, and 72"" tall, with some amount of soil at the bottom. The 72"" height would probably be from the ""ground"", so the overall height might be closer to 84-86"". By keeping the depth to 26"" overall it should fit through any doorway. In terms of reptile species, I had looked at the Emerald Swift and I like it, and preliminary reading suggests they like to climb things, but I'm open to other possibilities.  The Question:  Is there a formula for calculating how many gallons the enclosure should be based on the length/size of the reptile?  Or, is this different for each species?  How does being vertically-oriented affect the ""usable"" space? "
559,What's the effect of a dog watching you clean up his poo?,"If I'm outside and my dog poops, I'm obliged to clean it up. My dog sees me do this.  What's the effect of this. Will the dog think this is a dominant act or a submissive act, or just ignore it?   Is there an alternative to this? (as in: cleaning up the poo in a dominant way) "
560,How can I ensure my cat won't resent me after being alone for an 8-hour work day?,"I was raised with cats although my parents were always home so my cats adored them and there was always somebody around to pet them.    As I go into the world, I'll be single.  I mean, I'm young so it's okay, but I still want a cat, or two, since I'll be living alone.  Working an an electrical engineer, I'll most likely be at my job for 40+ hours a week, normal job stuff.   Do I  need to make sure that my cats are entertained while I'm away?  Is there anything I can do to ensure my cat will still sit next to me on the couch when I come home? "
561,How can I keep disease from spreading in my fish tank?,"If I discover I have fish in my tank that are sick or diseased, is there a generally accepted way to keep them from spreading whatever they have to my other fish? Can I separate them into another tank, for example? Or will that stress them because they are already ill, and kill them?   How can I keep my fish safe? "
562,What age do cats stop growing on average?,I've heard humans stop growing around age 18-24. What about cats? When do they stop growing in height? 
563,If I train my rabbit to jump fences will she STILL stay in a two foot exercise pen?,"I just watched Rabbit Jumping: How to Get Started I have a couple of rabbits that are very trainable, but I take them a lot of places where I expect them to stay in 2 foot high exercise pens.  If I teach them to jump fences, will they start jumping out of the pen on their own?  "
564,My dog only pees in the house when I'm not home,"My 13 month old dog started peeing in the house again after being house trained.  He would only do it at night (when I was asleep) or when I would go out.  At first it seemed just like an accident, but when it started happening more consistently (even when walked immediately before bed or right before I left) I switched to crate training.  He's been mostly fine with the crate, though he does sometimes get stressed in there.  After a month, I decided to try seeing if the habit was broken.  I left him alone in the house (not in the crate) for about 20 minutes to run an errand, and when I got back he had peed 3 times.  If he's only peeing in the house when I'm not there to catch him, how do I correct the behavior?  Or should I just continue to leave him in his crate?  He doesn't have this problem  when I'm home (and awake), even if he's unsupervised or if it's been a while since his last walk.      I don't have access to comment, so to answer your question, Jeremy, I don't know if he has peed in the house while left alone with others.  I live alone, so if he's home with someone it's usually me.  My sister dogsat for him one weekend, and he definitely peed while I was gone, though she said she didn't see him do it (it might have been overnight or when she was out as well). "
565,How does losing a tail affect a cat?,"I have a cat that just got home from getting her tail amputated. She is about 10 years old, she's typically an outside cat, but since the incident we are going to keep her inside.  My question is, how does a cat first react to losing its tail, and how will this affect the future behavior of the cat? (lack of balance? possible depression?) "
566,Why does my cat bite me when I sneeze?,"Whilst typing on the computer just now (late night), I sneezed a few times. My cat comes running in from the other room and bites me on the arm. I shouted at him loudly enough to wake the upstairs neighbors who are still walking around above me.  Why does he attack me when I sneeze? Is there any way to train him to stop? "
567,Why does my cat eat dog food?,"He knows where the cat food is, and he mostly eats cat food, but there are times he'll eat some of the dogs food, even when there is cat food available for him.  Why is this happening? The cat food we currently get doesn't seem to be a problem; it's as if he wants variety.  I wanna put on record that my dogs and cats actually share the same water bowl (related question Is it harmful to allow animals of different species to share the same water bowl? ). Does this play a role as to why he might also be eating the dog food? "
568,Is it harmful to allow animals of different species to share the same water bowl?,"This question can apply to any kind of animal, but I'm mostly targetting the aspect of cats and dogs sharing the same water bowl.  Does this affect the relationship between animals? Would it be preferred to have separate water bowls due to dominance, or is sharing the water bowl actually allowing the abimals to bond?  My animals don't seem to mind it, although there have only been a few occasions where I've seen a dog and cat drink from the same bowl at the same time "
569,How to stop a cat from being aggressive towards me and others?,How do i stop my cat from being aggressive towards me and others? I just bought my cat three-days ago and had no problem but this morning I woke up to check on my cat but when I tried to touch her she has been very aggressive. She tries to bite my hand aggressively and now I cant even touch my own cat.   I got her from overstock.com because I seen that they were now selling animals online. I am going to get her to the vet tomorrow to see what the veterinarian says. I also noticed that she has not eaten her food nor drank her water. She also seems to not use the bathroom so I tried to look around and see what she gotten into and so far there was nothing she had gotten into. Is there any way I can check to see if she is alright without her trying to hurt me? 
570,Can a human glucose meter be used to check the blood sugar of a pet?,"Diabetes is a terrible disease that affects people and pets. If both I, and my pet, have diabetes, can I use my meter to check my pets blood sugar?  On a quick check of the internet, I found a commercial reference suggesting that I need to purchase a special meter for a cat or a dog.  Is this just commercial hype, or do I really need a species specific meter? "
571,Why won't my dog defecate in the yard while on a leash?,"I have a dog that will refuse to go number two in the backyard when being walked; it will go immediately when taken out of the yard though. Why is this?  Basically, this is not specifically training; more like curiousity on this behavior and reasoning. I mean, it will urinate in the yard and will defecate if unleashed but while being walked, even for long durations and coming back from a walk outside of the yard, it will not defecate in the backyard while on a leash.  This problem is bad because my dog will always go in its cage the following day, after refusing to go while being walked around the yard.  Is my dog not comfortable going in the yard while being walked? Then why will it urinate? It will go if let loose, but it can't be let loose anymore because it escape the yard, and sometimes it have to be walked just in the backyard due to weather-related concerns or such.  So why would my dog refuse to defecate while on a leash and how could I change this behaviour? "
572,How to tell sex and spay/neutered of rabbit?,"I found a domesticated rabbit on the side of a bike trail in a park. I've had it 12 hours and contacted local rescue / police in case someone reports it missing. While I take care of it, I have a few questions...  How do I tell the sex of the rabbit? The advice here How do you tell the gender of a rabbit? does not seem applicable.  How do I tell if it is spayed or neutered? "
573,Essential care for rescue rabbit,"I found a rabbit on the side of a trail in the woods. Clearly domesticated. Possibly released. While I wait for replies to rescue organizations and Craigslist replies from the owner (and if no reply, decide if I'll keep or give away), what should I be doing?   I bought some hay and food and a ""chew stick"" and gave it a cushioned cat bed in a corner. I placed cardboard on the floor around that area I've petted it. While petting, I found two tiny ticks and removed them. I also saw two fleas. I did not see any other critters. Is this indicative of an infestation, or is it likely just a few that were picked up while it was outside? I placed an unplugged cord nearby and it sniffed but did not chew it I'm now letting it run around and explore the house. Is there anything above I shouldn't be doing? Is there anything else I should be doing?    "
574,My second cat doesn't know how to play with my other cat and thinks that she's being attacked,"We've got a 7-month old calico cat named Milù, who is very active, mischievous and loves to play - with toys or with us. She loves playing hide-and-seek, stalking on us, attacking our hands and feet, chasing us and being chased by us and doing her high jumps when playing with her da Bird toys.   Milù is not a very cuddly cat but she's sweet in her own way. She loves following us around, squatting on the floor to trip us and meows if she doesn't see us. She's a purring machine at night and loves to knead and cuddle with us while we sleep.   I work from home and as you would know, cat + work at home = disaster. My cat simply wouldn't let me work, intentionally or even unintentionally. She's a very active cat and needs constant attention and play. She usually brings me her toys as if telling me ""let's play"" and I just don't have the heart to tell her no. Sometimes, when I ignore her, she lightly bites my legs and hands to show she's upset with me. Other times, she would stare at me for so long and God only knows what she's thinking. I just melt and give in. I tried locking myself in the room so I could concentrate on my work but she meows at the door or stays and waits there for me even for hours.    So I convinced my husband to get another cat for our calico so she won't feel alone when I work. Many people say two cats are better than one and I got encouraged by this. After all, when we went on a vacation with our cat, I saw her very much interested with other cats and dogs visiting us at our rented apartment at a farm. We thought she wouldn't be hostile to other cats.      So I called a local shelter and I told them I need an active and playful cat for my calico. They told me they have this 4-month old and already spayed female tabby cat who is a purring machine and loves playing. They also said she had lived at some point with older cats in the streets. She looked like a perfect match to Milù and we decided to get her and named her Violetta.  Violetta is the sweetest cat I've ever met. She purrs loudly to everyone, loves sitting and kneading your lap, and she will do this for hours at any time of the day. She's also full of energy. She never gets tired playing with toys. She's got some flaws too, though. She's not good at cleaning herself, always has claws out for everything (so it hurts when she kneads, so I trimmed her nails) and she complains a lot even over small things. She's also so eager and has a me first attitude.  We did the usual cat introduction ritual for a week - separate rooms, gradual introduction of scents, site swapping, cats eating behind a door, etc. Everything went quite well. Initially, there were some hisses from my resident cat but then she started to feel more comfortable each day. When there were no more hissing and they could eat their meals together, we decided to completely open the house for them. I was so happy to see them sleep almost close to each other and when they started to play. However, this is where the problem starts.  When finally, Milù felt comfortable around Violetta, she gradually went back to her real self - she started zooming around the house again, something she didn't do on the first few days Violetta was introduced to her. And she started playing with Violetta, and she seemed so eager to having her as a playmate. At first, she was a bit of a bully to Violetta, probably to establish dominance over her, and Violetta was fine with this. Then she started chasing Violetta around, something Violetta didn't like at first and she would whine. Then probably Violetta understood that Milù didn't want to hurt her and they started chasing each other around - i.e. literally running around, Milù runs after Violetta then vice versa. Until here, everything was fine. But Milù doesn't want to just run around, she wants a real cat play, - i.e. more physical - swatting, wrestling, biting, etc. And I think this is just normal? But Violetta doesn't want any contact at all, and whenever Milù swats at her or even lightly touches her tail, Violetta would whine and sometimes screams as if she is being murdered.   We tried telling Milù to be more gentle with Violetta, and she did this. When she corners Violetta, she turns around and leaves Violetta alone. But as soon as she has her back on Violetta, Violetta would jump and chase her, and the play begins again, Milù becomes a bit physical, then Violetta whines, and so on. This went on for a while and we thought Violetta would then figure out how to confront Milù.  When they're not playing though, they behave really well. Milù has stopped hissing completely and has accepted Violetta in her home.  However, during playtime, Violetta's whining became worse, then she started growling, then hissing, and I think this frustrated Milù. All she wanted was to play with Violetta. I observed her during their play, and she doesn't seem to have her claws out. I can even see her restraining herself but Violetta continues with her whining. Every time Milù corners her, Violetta would lie on her back in defensive mode and whines and growls at Milù. But if there's aggression on Milù's part, I don't understand why Violetta would come running back at Milù for more play once Milù has turned her back on her.  Two days ago though, somehow things went out of hand. During these plays, Milù, strangely, didn't back down as usual and continued swatting at Violetta. Violetta was screaming and growling, Milù pounced and wouldn't listen to me. My 8-year old daughter was crying and yelling at Milù while she watches the scene inches away from her feet. It was surreal! I had to sprinkle water on Milù to separate the cats. And we put them in separate rooms the whole day.  When my husband came back from work, we tried to put the two cats together again. Everything looked fine. The cats were acting as if nothing happened. Then they started playing! And everything went upside down. They ended up in a serious fight with fur flying around. Milù didn't look worked up, but Violetta was so mad.  So we tried concentrating on Violetta and have made some observations. When we're playing alone with Violetta with a toy, she's so pumped up with adrenaline and even has more energy than Milù does. However, she seems to know how to play with toys only. Other than that, she's unresponsive or doesn't know what to do in other kinds of games. Laser dot - no response, playing with hands - no response, stalking - uninterested, hide and seek - uninterested, us surprising her - no response, she just looks at us, chasing with us - no response.  But these are the things Milù loves doing! And now I'm at a loss!  I don't know much about Violetta but it seems she grew up completely isolated from other cats that she doesn't know how to interact with them, and every move another cat makes is a threat for her. So I think this is why she suddenly assumes a defensive stance when Milù plays with her. And somehow, Violetta's unpredictability has frustrated Milù.  Now my situation is this: I've got two cats who both need attention, one is in the living room, the other in the bedroom. I can't work because Milù is with me and wants attention, while I hear Violetta meowing at the door in the living room. And it's driving me crazy. Now that Violetta has known the whole house, she isn't fine with being confined again in a room and is constantly meowing.  I'm seriously considering re-homing Violetta. First, because I don't know how to deal with her situation. Milù is my first cat and I have her for only 6 months so my experience in cat is very limited. Violetta needs to know how to be a cat, but only a cat could teach her how to do that. And honestly, I'm not sure if I'd like to sit and wait 'till she learns from Milù. What if they end up hurting each other seriously? I've got an 8-year old daughter and it breaks my heart seeing her cry and yell whenever the two cats fight. What if they end up hurting my daughter in one of those fights?  I really think Violetta is a perfect cat in a household with no other animals in it. I wish they had told me more about Violetta's upbringing before they gave it to me.   Any advice or thoughts would be much appreciated. "
575,Outdoor cat comes in and pees on my bed,"The cat in question is a female. She is probably 5 or 6 years old, maybe older, outdoor farm cat. She has always lived outside but is super friendly and loves to be petted.  When I let her in I put down a small bowl of dry food and water. She checks that first. She seems calm and loving. But then she pees in my bed. Can I get her to stop this?  I have prepared an outside shelter for her as well. It is 1.5' x 3' and has heat from a light bulb and a heated water dish.  She wants to come in and be petted and I oblige! But I understand if I must just keep her outside to protect my bed.  Any idea or suggestions about what to do? "
576,How can I make my duck lay in the box,"I have two ducks and a drake. Ten days ago, I found an egg on the ground, out of the hen house. Today, I found another one, somewhere else.   Has the duck laid other eggs during this ten days? The run is very large and I cannot find anything there.  Can I do anything, so that she lays in the box?  "
577,Leashed Cat on Windowsill above fire escape,"I have an indoor cat that I want to provide fun, interesting experiences for as I imagine my studio apartment is a bit small for a full grown cat.   Since she's a kitten she's always sat by a window we leave cracked open and looked out at the streets. I recently bought a cat harness and leash and have been putting it on her, tying it to something sturdy, then opening the window next to my fire escape to let her stick her head out, smell the air and get a better look at the outside world. I sit near and supervise the whole time. She usually spend 10-15 minutes sniffing and peering out, watching cars go by, etc at which point she'll walk inside and I'll close the window then remove the harness.  Each time so far she's run under the bed after and hid for about 5-10 minutes. There's no other odd behavior following it, she's usually back out and about as long as we wait a few minutes and call her.  She seems pretty happy to be looking out as she stays there on her own, doesn't fight the harness (except for the expected fussing when putting on/taking off), and has not ever had any accidents that I would associate with fear except for the bed thing.  So my question is two-fold:   Is there any reason not to allow a cat out on a window that is leashed, harnessed and supervised? Is the bed thing anything to worry about?  "
578,Kittens drinking from a male cat?,"I have 4 kittens, 3 from one mother (5 months old) and another from a different mother (6 months old) and recently we noticed that these younger three kittens keep trying to feed from the 6 month year old one, which happens to be a male? The mother has been feeding them regularly for about 3-4 months (she is still here but she started to avoid them during the 4th month so they would stop feeding).  Is this normal cat behavior or should we be worried?  They get food and water regularly and they appear to be in good health. The kitten they keep trying to feed from doesn't seem to mind and purrs when they do it. I don't know, I've never encountered this before so I don't know if it's ok or if we should od something? "
579,What color should I paint my barred owl house?,I built a barred owl house.    I painted it with an exterior white oil primer initial coat to protect the wood.  I live in the NorthEast.  Do I need to camouflage paint it?  Paint it brown like a tree trunk? Of just leave it white?  NOTE: I am trying to attract a local owl I've seen to use it. 
580,Will my dog’s leg be healed if he has damaged his leg?,"Context  Few days ago, when it was Halloween event, I used to play with my sister’s cool balloon and when the dog saw it, he jumped and barked at the ballon( I didn’t know why, but I never thought of what consequences he’ll have). So I put on my sister’s desk and at night he tried to jump to the balloon and when he jumped, something wrong has happened. An accident. I felt very bad for him.  He has also had a crotch neck due to the fact that, a girl unintentionally when she raised him in her arms, he accidentally escaped and fell, and that caused him to have a crotched neck.  And if he will never heal up, I would feel the most miserable being because I didn’t know how to take care of him. And he has become my responsibility until the death comes upon him( in a natural way).  Question: Can someone please tell me if, my dog will be healed? Because, I’m very worried about him. I do not want to feel as if I have wretched the poor dog’s life. Because, simply it is not in my intention.  NOTE: If I have asked in a wrong site, can you please immigrate how to the right site? "
581,Iontophoresis: does this method have any real scientific backing?,"My dog has been administered procaine (called Novocain here in Ukraine) via iontophoresis as part of therapy for intervertebral disk disease, but I have serious doubts about this method.  It was widely used in Soviet polyclinics for humans, and still is as many of those polyclinics haven't really changed, but AFAIK it never helped anyone. It seems to be useless Soviet legacy alternative medicine administered chiefly to hypochondriac babushkas as placebo.   Or am I mistaken? Is there any evidence for its effectiveness?  Is it really able to make the molecules of the drug go deeper compared to simply applying the drug to the skin without any electricity? Is it really able to 'keep the tissues saturated with procaine'? Did any researchers actually measure how much saturated it gets? Please help me find their results then.  On the other hand, I don't want to argue with the vet because he is a surgeon with a good reputation. Most probably it'll be him who'll do the surgery if it gets needed. I'm really confused.  I'm following the rest of his instructions: giving pills (coxibs). But this iontophoresis thing is really strange to me. The vet told to come to the clinic every day to do this procedure, which costs money, and the taxi costs money. And it'll take a lot of time every day while the effectiveness of the method is super dubious. I don't want to ask other local vets because Ukrainians are used to iontophoresis since childhood and probably never really question it for this reason.  I'd really love to have some more clarity in this stupid situation. Even if you simply know a better place on the Internet to ask this question, I'd be glad to get a comment from you. "
582,Is my cornsnake overweight?,"      My 3 Year old boy (corn snake) has come back to me after being looked after by a friend for 9 months. I'm concerned about his body shape; he seems to have a pivot where his spine is, with mounds either side down the while length of his body. I'm wondering if he is overweight? He still has full interest in food.  And just FYI, my friend used him to mate her snake against my wishes if that has anything to do with anything ?! "
583,Why would defanged snakes not bite?,"Regarding scope, this question is about a situation that occurred in what seems very unlikely to be a private home, but rather type of exhibition or possibly breeding venue. However, according to the Meta question ""Is there a distinction between questions on pets, and questions about professional/amateur breeding of pet animals for show or sale?"" the community seems to consider this within scope.   Please also note that I consider defanging to be unethical and can not imagine any situation in which I would support it. I am asking this question out of curiosity.  With that out of the way, I will move on to the question.    There is a video called ""Cleaning the Cobra Pit"". In it, a man is moving cobras around and brushing up stuff from their habitat. He is removing all their eggs, of which there is a fair number. Most species would defend their eggs and young fiercely, and it seems cobras are no exception.  What gets people's attention regarding the video is that the man is getting very close to the snakes, even touching them, walking amongst them, etc, and none of them are acting aggressively towards him, attempting to bite him, etc. Well, some of them (far from all) do raise their hoods and enter a defensive position, but he is totally ignoring that and grabbing after them, and they do not actually strike. From what limited contact I have had with cobras, my understanding is that most cobras would strike in that situation.  The snakes generally do not seem to fear the man very much. The man also seems entirely unafraid of the snakes.  I am assuming that these snakes are defanged, or otherwise venomoids. I can not think of any other explanation for the situation observed in the video. However, I am not very knowledgeable about the topic, so I may be wrong.  If my assumption is wrong, then how can this man do what he is doing without being bitten?  I have seen videos of defanged snakes behaving aggressively (or defensively, you may call it) and attempting to bite people.  Why would these snakes not bite the man cleaning the pit? Could it be that he has raised them from their infancy, and that they are sufficiently tame not to act aggressively/defensively towards him? There is quite a large amount of snakes. "
584,Got an 11-week male lab puppy. We live in NY city apartments and I am not sure if he has received any shots. I have a few questions,"My wife and I got a new male lab puppy, who is living with us in our apartment. I have a few questions, I would really appreciate if you could me out here.  Issue:  Not sure if the puppy has received his first shot. I got this puppy from a friends acquaintance, who lives on a farm in PA and had a litter. When asked for medical records he showed me the vaccination record for a female puppy, but not for the one we got and said that our puppy got the exact ones. No document makes me anxious.  Questions:   Can I take him out for a walk or to potty train? Is there a risk of catching viruses? Let's assume he has been vaccinated.. then if I take him to the vet and they vaccinate him, is that safe for the pup? He does not poop on the wee wee pads .. how do I get him to do this?   I don't have any family members who have ever had a pet. I've never had a pet. please help... Thank you  Leo the good boy: [website]"
585,What does it mean when the skin on my cats' backs twitches?,"I've noticed this behavior on two of my cats, and I don't believe it is feline hyperesthesia (neither exhibit any of the other symptoms commonly associated with the condition, and the back twitching does not seem random).  Instead, I believe it is possibly a social/communication cue of some sort.  Typically, it seems that the two cats (our oldest, an alpha female, and our younger male) both will display the back-twitching behavior when I start talking to them.  What does this mean?  Is it an invitation to pet them (both are quite affectionate)?  Is there documented research that describes this behavior as a social cue among cats? "
586,Should I feed my cat milk?,"My cat seems to enjoy a bowl of cow's milk. I have noticed some runny stools, since I have been giving him milk. Could the milk be causing this?  We are thinking about getting another cat (as a kitten), would it be advisable to feed the kitten milk and why? "
587,Is chocolate harmful for dogs?,"There's all this fuss over feeding dogs chocolate and how it can be harmful and even fatal.  I had never heard of this growing up and we never had a problem all the years we had dogs, but looking back I cannot remember a time any of our dogs would've eaten chocolate (we were much too concerned with consuming it ourselves than to let our dogs get a hold of it!).  Is it true that chocolate can be harmful for dogs, and if so, why?    Is it harmful for puppies, or are they different? "
588,Can check (choke) chains still be used to successfully train dogs?,"We grew up using check chains (also known as choke chains) on our dogs (responsibly, or so I thought). There are articles like this one (Flying Paws Dog Training) saying these chains should never be used in training. I really am unsure what to think.  When training big dogs, it's important to have some control over them.  I can understand how a small dog could be hurt by incorrect use of a check chain, but some big dogs have pretty strong necks.   Are check chains truly bad for a dog's health?   Is there statistical research to back this up?  What effective physical control substitutes exist for check chains?  "
589,Is it harmful to use a prong collar?,"I asked this question Can check (choke) chains still be used to successfully train dogs? and wanted to address specifically the use of a prong collar.    (image courtesy of Wikipedia)  Is it harmful to  use a prong collar and if so, why? "
590,What treats are dangerous for me to feed my cat?,"Considering Is chocolate harmful for dogs? , are there foods which can endanger my cat?

Are onions dangerous for my cat or dog and why? "
591,How long can fox baits be harmful for my dog?,"My neighbors whippet recently died from going into the bush when there were fox baits. The councils do warn that they are laying baits. (I also had a whippet that died from being baited on our common property here, but that's a separate story)  The local councils here use Foxoff® poison baits (containing 1080). Is this kind of bait something that becomes safe after a certain time or do they all need to be eaten?  It concerns me, as even though the council gives a time period that is not safe, after my neighbor's dog died, I've been a bit worried about baits being left in the bushland.  Also, does anyone know how this kills the dog, is it a painful way to die? I haven't been able to ask my neighbor exactly what happened as she is too distressed. "
592,What signs indicate a dog has been baited with poison?,"I asked How long can fox baits be harmful for my dog? about my neighbor's dog dying from eating fox bait.  We had a rescue whippet when we first moved into this apartment complex. She loved to go for walks with our neighbor, a lovely lady, also a whippet owner, who would also have another, third whippet join the dogs on the walks.  At the time our body corporate was inundated with some very nasty threats by one of the apartment owners. Another neighbor's dog (a Staffordshire Bull Terrier) was suspected of being poisoned (baited) as she was very ill, but came through it.  On one walk where I was not present, I was told that the three dogs ran down one of the stairwells, then came running back and that my dog had gone into the garden to relieve herself and maybe sniffed around a bit.  Shortly after, my dog started having a seizure and foaming at the mouth. I was told this lasted for approximately half an hour, as my neighbor rushed her to the vet, but my dog died in the car on the way. I was told she seemed to be in pain and was panting, but at one point calmed down, before resuming the seizure (if that it what it was) and dying.  She had been an abused whippet and my neighbors were convinced it was because of that, maybe she had been hit on the head and a previous brain injury and so had the seizures from this (which can happen with head injuries).  However since then, my neighbors dog died from running into the bush and eating a fox bait. So it has gotten me thinking about my little dog.  What are some of the symptoms of a dog being poisoned/ baited and how long could it take for the symptoms to surface after ingesting a bait?  Here is Coco, our whippet, who died. :(   "
593,"What are some safe, healthy treats for my turtle?","I want to spoil my yellow-bellied slider a little bit, but I don't know what to provide as treats to break up the regular diet of pellets.  I know that they are omnivores, and her previous owner said that she occasionally got fish, which also provided some extra exercise. I was thinking of going that route, but I have no idea what type of fish to purchase. Also, what kinds of vegetables do they eat? Do they eat crickets?  What kinds of fish, bugs, and vegetables can I offer my pet turtle to make her happy? What kinds should I avoid? "
594,Are onions dangerous for my cat or dog and why?,"Someone advised me not to feed my cat or dog foods which include garlic or onion, as they are bad for my pets and can make them sick.  Is this true? How would it make my cat or dog sick? "
595,Are dogs carnivores?,"I have been told that dogs are carnivores because they inherited the trait from their ancestors, The Wolves. I also read an article online that says that dogs have been able to evolve over the years on meat and non-meat scraps and leftovers of humans. The article also says that 80% of dog food should be meat.   Are dogs actually carnivores or omnivores? Is it true that 80% of dog food should be meat? How will not feeding them meat affect their health?   "
596,How can I improve the relations between my 3 dogs?,"Five months ago, I added a male dog to the family, a 7-months-old, Boxer / Pit Bull mix (though he looks like a Shar Pei) named Butcher.  The existing dogs are females: Brownie, 3-year-old, Weimaraner / Boxer mix, and Cochi, an almost 2-year-old, Boxer / Pit Bull mix.   Brownie is balanced; she remains very calm when Butcher is playing around her and teasing her.  Butcher is hyperactive, likes to play all day long, and is a bit insecure;  he often hides when he is barking at other dogs. Cochi is very energetic as well, it feels like she wants to protect everything from Butcher.   I have observed Cochi acting aggressively against Butcher since the beginning: she growls at him when he gets close to her. I don't want to interfere with the normal hierarchy. How can I improve the relation between them?  Is it OK to protect the little one when my older dogs growl or bark at him? I can tell Cochi senses Butcher's insecurity; how can I make him more confident? "
597,Can I make a baby wild rabbit a pet?,We had a cottontail rabbit that made a nest near our garden.  She had a litter of babies about 2 weeks ago but the other day she was hit by a car.  I checked on her babies this morning and only one is still alive.  We are going to try and raise it and were thinking about making it a pet.  Can wild rabbits raised as a baby be good pets?  We have other rabbits will the wild rabbit present any risks to them?  Do I need to feed the wild rabbit any differently than a domestic rabbit? 
598,My cat ate an unidentified lizard! What should I do?,My cat caught and ate a lizard. I do not know the type of lizard he ate.   Might this affect my cat negatively?    What signs should I look for to see if my cat is OK? Is it necessary to take my cat to the vet?   
599,Why are two of my cat's claws thicker than the others?,"Most of my cat's claws are very thin, and come to a needle-like point.  However, two of hers are shaped quite differently.  They are much thicker along the inside of the curve, and the tips are much blunter, and almost rounded.  Unfortunately, I cannot get a picture, because I'm lucky just to be able to trim them on occasion.  What causes this?  Is it something I should worry about? "
600,Why does my cat scratch so much against the sides of his litter box?,"While I understand cats and their desire to bury their waste when they are finished, my cat often sits in the litter box and digs against the plastic side of the litter box, not actually in the litter itself, so much so that he is actually wearing down the sides in places.   Why is he doing this? Is it a problem (other than the destruction of the litter box)? "
601,I work 8 hours per day at the office. Is it possible to have a dog if I live in a studio?,My question is: is it possible to leave your dog alone in your studio for 8 hours? Is there any breed that will be ok with that? How do people that have regular jobs have dogs? 
602,How to prevent play-fighting from escalating?,"I have a cat who likes to play-fight with me - and she clearly knows it's just a game, because she is usually very gentle about it, never uses her claws and only nips my hand or fingers softly - it is actually really cute. At least, at first. Because sometimes, she seems to escalate herself into some kind of frenzy where although she still keeps her claws sheathed she will start biting harder and harder until it is really painful. And I can not even break off the fight easily, because even if I withdraw my hand and put it somewhere else, she keeps trying to get close and bite it - I really have to shoo her off (sometimes repeatedly) to get her to stop. I don't suppose there is a way to stop her from becoming so frenzied, but is there at least a way I can unilaterally stop the fight when I notice it is happening that restores the peace without actually having to scare her away? Or should I just stop play-fighting with her altogether? For some background, she is the only cat (and pet) in the household, about 5-6 years old, and a 100% indoor cat. "
603,Getting to know a dog who has had little human contact: what does all this mean?,"2 months ago I bought a plot of land with a workshop on it, and the seller mentioned that he let his friend keep a dog there. He suggested I might like to have the dog stay on there, for security (he's not much of a guard dog once you get to know him, but at least it shows there's always someone visiting.)  The dog is half Irish setter, half some other hunting breed. I have zero experience with dogs.  From the start, it seemed to me that the dog was lonely. He always waits at the gate barking when my or any other car comes) and manically chases his tail when I leave. Yet he would not interact with me in a way I could relate to. He would follow me, but as soon as I turned to look at him, he would run off. At first I thought this was some kind of fear, but now I think it's a game.   I want to get on with this dog, but at the same time I want him to know I am in charge. As a result, for over a month we basically ignored each other. I'm not going to get involved in his running games, it's not what I'm there for. On the other hand I would be happy to interact with the dog by petting him.   A female friend visited and the dog immediately went to her to be petted. He also likes to be petted by the owner (and is happy to be petted by me when the owner is there.) On the other hand the first time the dog allowed me to pet him when there were just the two of us, was today, just after the owner left, and before he had had his customary howl about the owner leaving. I expect he will go back to his random, charging around ways tomorrow.  I asked the owner why he didn't have the dog at home. He said one of his children was scared of the dog. I asked him if the dog had been abused by a man and that was why he let my female friend pet him but not be, and he said he got the dog from a home but there was no prior abuse. I feel the dog would benefit from more social contact (both human and other dogs) and in particular would benefit from some training.  I observe the following behaviour patterns: what can / should I do about them?   Following me, then running away when I pay attention. This one freaks me out a bit sometimes, especially when he snorts right behind me. Sometimes he snorts when he's playing at ""hunting"" with his rag. (When I walk purposefully toward the dog he always stands his ground then suddenly darts out of the way to let me get where I'm going.) Smelling my urine, then urinating on top of it (there is no toilet for miles around this plot of land.) Is this some kind of display of dominance or is it harmless? (I'm sure the dog himself doesn't know why he does it.) Anyway, that in itself is not a problem, but he also likes  urinating on my car (its such an old car I've decided not to make a fuss about this, though I gave him a good shouting for trying to urinate on my generator.) Running in front of my car. When I leave the dog runs round and round my car, and frequently runs in circles right in front of it. This behaviour is quite annoying, and the only ""solution"" I have is to sound my horn. I really would hate to injure him.   I get the impression the dog likes having me there though he cannot or will not interact in a way which shows we are friends. My way of showing this would be to pet him, but he seems more interested in his ""approach then suddenly run away"" game which I will not be part of. I would like to have more trust with him, in order to be able to reduce some of his antisocial behaviours, as I feel bad bawling him out for doing things I dislike as it's not really his fault if he's never been told.  *As discussed in the comments, I've only bawled him out for urinating on my generator, as I consider it potentially dangerous to the dog.

605,"Recently adopted Schipperke mix, question regarding its ACL/CCL surgery","My girlfriend and I just recently adopted a schipperke mix from the humane society near us. She's a 5year old(give or take a few years), who had ACL surgery back on 8/22/15. She's in roughly week 6 of recovery now.   She was in foster care for some time during the surgery, and then went on to the humane society. Since we've gotten her, she definitely continues to have a limp, especially after sleeping extended periods of time. I've been doing leg stretches for her on the hip, knee and ankle joints every morning and night, we carry her down stairs, but every morning i let her walk up one batch of stairs(15 stairs).   We've been giving her 30-45 minute walks each day(since monday when we adopted her).   On 10/10/15 I see a note taken saying(this based on what i can read):  ""Rev 6 weeks(assume recovery time), Looking good, a may minimal/mild favoring still, mostly no limp"". We are supposed to keep her on strict leash until 10/30/15. Her left lateral stifle has a ""bump"" which was also noted on 9/17/15 by the foster parents, and it still is present.   I'm mainly concerned as I've never dealt with ACL/CCL surgeries before. She is definitely not wanting to put much weight on the leg, which is what is concerning me. When we lift her up to ""dance"", she puts a majority of her weight on her good leg(right) and when we try to get her to take a few steps she resists. During walks we are not walking at a fast pace, walking on level ground with some incline, however she definitely limps on the leg and refuses to put any weight on it.   Is this ""normal""/expected? I dont want to put her under tooo much stress and cause more harm to that leg, however the humane society indicated that she really didn't have a limp. Is there things we should be doing? should we be forcing her to take 1-2 steps while dancing? Should we be putting heating packs on her knee area to help sooth it?  Thanks everyone! "
606,How long to wait before I remove the old filter,I have recently purchased a sponge filter just like this one. I added it to my tank when it arrived home about a week ago. My tank has been running for over 4 month now. The tank has been stocked for like 3 month so it has cycled already. For now both filter are in the tank to be sure I don't create an ammonia spike by removing the old hang on the back filter.

609,Dog bites at people's feet when they get close,"I have a 3 year old Yorkie.  He recently picked up a new mannerism that is causing some problems.  He will growl and bite at peoples shoes when they step close to him.  A few thing's I've noticed about the behavior:   It's never me or my wife that he bites at It's often when he's under a table or chair (so maybe it surprises him or he doesn't see the persons face), but not always. It's when the feet get close, but not necessarily close enough to step on him.  He will attack the feet from his position Usually men (maybe the bigger feet) Usually leather shoes (this could just be a coincidence)   The items I say ""usually"" with are because I originally thought that each occurrence was related to that, but he proved me wrong by attacking a woman's foot once and recently some Velcro shoes (yes, I said Velcro, can't say I blamed him for that one).  Anyway, most people have thought it was funny, but he's not playing around.  He's seriously violent when he gets into that mode and since he's so small he's easy to get under control, but sometimes I'll be talking to someone and not necessarily watching him. As soon as I look down I'll notice he's on the end of his leash biting a person with the intention of killing their foot.  I do fear that maybe he would do it to someone who is bare footed, or maybe even a child someday (but I think it does relate to the bigger feet).  Does anyone know why this would have recently started happening?  He's small but I don't think he's ever really been stepped on (could be wrong I guess).  And does anyone know what I might do to curb this behavior?   Thanks "
610,Overly friendly stray cat wants to come in our house,"We have a beautiful Calico stray cat outside our house. We played with her one day and she just followed us home from about half a mile away. We've been feeding her every day since then.   But every time I open the door to go in/come out of the house, this cat keeps trying to come in our house. She doesn't even want anything from us. She just wants to be in our house with us. It breaks our heart to put her outside, but we just cannot take her in right this minute.  I'd love some guidance on being able to bring this cat in.  About the cat:   Girl Calico looks like about a year and a half old. She used to live in an abandoned house about half a mile from our house. The abandoned house has about 50 stray cats (NOT joking). Not a single one of them ever came to us. She is so friendly, it makes me think she was once a domesticated cat thrown out of the house. She has long and SHARP claws. She doesn't really know how to control her claws. She always pushes her claws out when playing with us. She climbs up our legs so rough, I have holes in my jeans.   Our problems with the cat coming in:   As I said, this cat lived with about 50 other cats. So she probably has fleas and ticks and whatever else there is. We have a 16 month old who doesn't really know how to be nice to the cat. The cat is incredibly patient, but I am not trying to push it. We have a 16 month old and we do not want to risk the baby getting ticks or fleas or something else from this cat. We do not really have a lot of money to spare for the cat's health expenses.   My questions:   Could I go to a department store or a pharmacy and pick something up that would clean the cat up all-around? I HATE declawing and would not do it. Is there a less crueler process to make their claws not as sharp? The cat's eyes always have some liquid leaking out of them. What could this be and what could I do regarding that?   Note: I am trying my best to bring this cat inside my house given the temperatures are dropping severely outside. She is cold. She wants to be in our house more than anything. I just need to get things straightened out first.  Note 2: I know she NEEDS to go to the vet, we are just a bit financially tight for the time being.  Thank you. "

614,Adopting (rescuing) a pair of Big pet store Leopard Geckos that were raised by uninformed - Help,"Looking for input from experienced Gecko keepers that have cared for Geckos with MBD or impaction so we know what to watch and be prepared for with our new adopted Leopard Geckos.  The Good Both look visually healthy(plump tail, clear eyes, posture and skin looks good in pics). Owners were adults who fed, cleaned tank and handled them 2-3+ times per week and really tried to do the right thing with limited knowledge. They say they have never been sick ( no runny poop, lethargy, mobility issues, cloudy eyes or poor appetite).  The Bad: they were never given calcium and half the 20 gallon tank is sand (not always reptile sand). Help!  They seem healthy now but we are preparing for possible health issues(MBD or impaction) based on their history. What do we need to watch for, plan for and is there anything we can proactively do? If they stay healthy for a certain amount of time are they still at risk for either later in their lives?    The Other They don't know the temp they were incubated so genders aren't known yet, no signs of aggression to each other(we'll separate them if they are both males or if there is any sign of an issue)   Question?:If they are male/female should we separate them until they are a little older? We are OK with babies and have a lay box and are prepped for that but I'm not sure if they are too young or if we should avoid letting them bred because of the other potential health issues. Input?  Their History: They are 7-8 months, found on craigslist, originally bought from Big Pet store (can I say the name?) as small juveniles and owners were not given care instructions and salesperson couldn't answer any questions. They set them up with mealworms, water bowl, sand, 1 hide, astroturf and a basking light and rock and gave no warning that if they ended up both being males that they should plan to separate them :(  Our History: Our family, primarily my teenage son (""the reptile whisperer""), were educated by a reputable local reptile guy on Skink &amp; Gecko husbandry and have a couple very healthy thriving Leos right now but working with ones that may have issues is new to us.    Here's what we do with ours:  Tanks: 10gallon for 1 Gecko, 20gallon for (2)Geckos (2 females or male and female if they get along and are healthy). Substrate we use is usually ECO earth coconut fiber or kitchen roll. Primary heat (Undertank Pad covers about 40% of tank) and we have low heat lamp(not a basking lamp!) that we rarely use - only if the tank temps are off between hot and cold side. 3 hides: 2 warm/hot (one moist) and one cold, water bowl, small bowl with a little calcium(most of the time), light controlled to promote good sleep cycles, temps on both side of the tank monitored.  Diet&amp;care: Fed gut-loaded crickets daily or every other day, dusted with calcium w/D3 2-3+ times per week, infrequently a Hornworm treat, and tank cleaned frequently. Moist hide and water are checked every other day. Handled 3 -5 days per week - very bonded and comfortable. Son weighs them every couple weeks sometimes more frequent when they were younger. He also makes sure if there are (2) in the tank that both are eating - when younger he separated them to eat: one was a faster hunter (not aggressive just faster).  He also has needed to help one of our females get extra shed off occasionally if she doesn't get it all after a couple days - I'm amazed she totally lets him help with no squirming and she's usually very active its like she totally gets it.     Follow-up questions:   What is Egg binding? Do you have any idea if a radiograph is common and whether it's really expensive? We are planning on taking them to our reptile guy but just wondering what kind of cost to expect ? What about the possibility of impaction from the sand? Is there anything proactive and not too invasive we can do to help reduce the possibility ?   "
615,Kitten eating clumping litter,"I just got a new kitten, 7 weeks old. He has been in the house for about 2-3 days and has gone pee multiple times and pooped once. He is litter trained, but he has been chewing on litter. I am unsure if he has been swallowing this litter and how often he chews on it. I cannot see a vet until next month. When should I be worried about this litter blocking his system? Is this a common or does this easily occur with a few grains?  "
616,Managing dog on furosemide (Lasix),"The background  My 9 year old cavvie with CHF was just put on Furosemide after a bit of a scare where his chest and abdomen had quite a lot of fluid built up (approx. 20 fl oz). He's back to his svelte self and he's very bouncy, chipper and affectionate. It's like the dial has been turned back - a lot of the things I had chalked up to him being an older dog is more rightly attributed to the buildup. If it wasn't for his heart condition, he'd be in perfect health.  So now it's alleviated, and he's been on pimobendan and enalipril with hydrocodone for his cough when it gets bad for about 2 years. He's been on furosemide for a little under a week @ 50mg twice daily. My dog is ~25 lbs.  The issue  His elimination schedule is intense and frequent. I go home from work for lunch every day to check on him, so the impact to my schedule is minimal. He's had an accident on the couch every day so far. I don't mind cleaning it up (it's a pretty old, grody couch anyway), but it looks like it happens in his sleep. There's a big, soaked patch where he had the accident, and then a less wet patch where he lay down and it transferred from his fur to the fabric.  He seems to be making it from 1 - 4:30 without any problems.  When my partner and I are home, it's no problem. He generally positions himself so he can peek at us from over/around furniture with his big eyes like O_O to get our attention so we can take him out. He has no accidents when we're awake.  He's had an accident overnight most nights as well.  What we've tried  My first gambit was to ask the vet if we could reduce the dosage. He wasn't keen on the idea since the fluid buildup was so severe.  I've tried playing with the dosage timing so that his most urgent need to eliminate is when we're home or before we leave. This has had mixed success. 8am 8pm hasn't really worked. Will try 6am 6pm tomorrow to see if that leaves us with anything drier.  What's on the way  I've ordered some doggie grass so that we can train him to use it to use during the day when we're not home and during the night.  The questions  Do dogs ""get used"" to being on furosemide? Does the urination urgency decrease as they acclimate themselves to the drug? Does dosage timing make a difference? Do you have any suggestions that we can try?  Thanks in advance. "
617,Should kitten be isolated to one room?,"My kitten is still in the process of potty training. I have only had him for a week so he is still learning the layout of the house. He has only had one accident during this time. Should I lock him up in the room with his litter box while I am at work? If so, for how long should I do this?  "
618,Pee patches on grass,"My dog is a Labrador English mastiff cross. She was a rescue and we think she's around 9.   She suffers from arthritis and has received injections for her conditions although not for over a year. She's on Royal Canin mobility food which has done wonders for her with just the occasional flair of stiffness.  There's a small patch of grass she uses to pee on in the morning and night which looks awful now due to the acid in her pee.  I know there are lots of products out there to help my grass not going yellow. I haven't used any yet because I feel it might have a detrimental effect on her and damage her health.  Question: Are these products safe? What's the best with the least side effects? Are there more natural ways to deal with this?  Btw, I live in the U.K.  Edit: I meant there are products that can be put in the dog's water to deal with the problem "
619,How to stop cats from eating toxic plants?,"The Background  We have 2 cats, and they are wonderfully smart…except when it comes to eating certain things that they have no business eating.  One of these things is plants.  One of our cats once ate a dead leaf that blew in from outside.  A few minutes later, he threw it up…then promptly began eating another dead leaf.  (I stopped him and swept all the leaves out of the house.)  Our other cat loves to chew on individual bristles of our broom.  Thankfully, he doesn’t eat them—but I really wish he wouldn’t!  He also likes to chew on fake christmas tree pine needles and tinsel, which we discourage through difficult access and shoo-ing him away when he gets close.  (But it is difficult.)    Now, I’ve known for years that this behavior often means the cat is trying to solve a digestive or nutritional issue. Before everyone piles on proclaiming this is the answer, please note the following:   we only feed our cats high-quality catfood (both wet and dry) this behavior has existed through several changes in catfood (both brand and flavor) we have had vets check the cats nutrition, blood chemistry, etc., and they are doing great   For these reasons, I don’t think that the unwanted behavior is due to the cats’ diet.  I think it’s just a peculiarity of these two individuals.    The Problem  I’m not allergic to cats, but I am interested in improving indoor air quality.  A nice, natural solution for this is simply to keep 3 specific houseplants and “grow your own fresh air”.    (That is, these 3 plants were tested as the best for removing allergens and VOCs from the air.)  However, I’m afraid to get these plants, because I think the cats will eat them (or at least chew on them).  They are listed as toxic to cats (and dogs).    The Questions   Is there any way to keep indoor houseplants, and be certain that they are inaccessible to cats? Apart from the usual dietary explanations, is there any other reason cats chew upon and eat things that they shouldn’t?  "
620,Two cats are attacking another cat,"I was having a walk today with a friend and I saw two cats--one of them is young and the other old-- attacking another young cat.  The young cat was afraid and looking at both cats expecting the next attack, and they would attack the cat frequently.  After sometime, the young evil cat hopped on the cat and bited it from the back and the cat started screaming of pain --The other old cat would also do that, so we interfered and separated the cats and we then started to push the evil cats away and we did that.  After sometime, the small cat would show us her belly, and other time she would voluntary go to the other cats and get attacked again.  What is going on here?What should I have done? leave them? or interfere?  They are stray cats, but I just wanted to know why they do that. "
621,Crate training a puppy: Should the cage be empty?,"I've read a few questions here discussing this (slightly), and it appears that one answer suggests dividing the cage somehow and letting one half be a bathroom area, and one half where the puppy can rest.  This denotes that the cage is not empty.    From what I've read elsewhere and have been told, the cage should be completely empty so that if/when the puppy goes in her cage, she will realize she is stuck with a puddle of her urine in her cage and nowhere to go which should in turn get her to stop urinating in her cage.    What is the proper thing to do in this situation?  Should the cage have some sort of towel for a cushion from the hard plastic tray, or should we leave it empty and let the puppy stick it out?  Shes usually in the crate from about 10pm to 6am. She is currently about 11 weeks old and the potty training adventure has really only just begun.  "
622,My 6 month old cat suckles and kneads on a blanket,"My cat suckles and kneads on this really soft blanket that I have and I think might resemble his mother. I was wondering if I could bottle feed him, but I dont know what or how I should do that? I know adult cats cannot have milk or cream. Should I bottle feed him or just let him continue to just suckle on the blanket? Thank you! "
623,Can dogs be allergic to materials that collars are made of?,"Recently, I posted a question about my puppy biting it's foot. One of the answers said allergies are common in Pitbulls.  My puppy itches at her collar quite often. She has a red spot on her neck that resembles a rash. It's only on one part of her neck, and not all the way around where the collar rests. I can't tell if it is just small cuts she may have caused while itching herself or an actual rash. Once the collar is off her, she typically does not itch there. She also likes to itch at her harness we use to walk her occasionally (which is 100% polyester).       You can see she scratches at the collar a lot. Can dogs be allergic to these kinds of materials? The collar is like a fake leather with little metal studs. Her collar before was like a strap that clipped together which she also itched at.  Is it possible she just dislikes collars?   She does not have fleas.  "
624,Dog refuses to eat unless fed by hand,"My dog is a 3 year old Pomeranian. He is very happy, active, and loves to be around other people. He used to eat only when people were around him so I used to accompany him during his eating times, which are during the morning and the night. Nevertheless, I have been having a problem regarding his eating habits.   A few months ago, an aunt stayed with us and hanged around the home most of the day. She loves animals, so my aunt spent a lot of time with my dog. She pet him, took him out, and started feeding him by putting the food on her hand and then he would eat it from her hand. She would pretty much feed him like if he was a little kid, which I thought was ridiculous. I talked to her about the issue, but she disregarded my conversation and did it behind my back. My aunt left a week ago, but now the problem is that my dog refused to eat unless I do the exact same thing. I am worried because I do not like to see him not eating for one or two days, but at the same time I don't like having him eat from my hand. How can I make my dog forget this habit of only eating from someone's hand?  I was thinking I would just stop doing it and he will eventually get really hungry and be forced to eat. However, I am worried he will just stop eating completely. What is the best approach to this issue? "
625,Should I discourage playful biting?,"While playing, my puppy likes to try and bite me occasionally. If she succeeds, it's not a full on bite, nor is it aggressive.  But should I discourage this behavior? If I proceed to allow her to play bite, what could I expect when she's older? "
626,Will neutering a kitten make him less able to protect himself?,"My kitten, 5 months old, spends 12 hours inside the home &amp; 12 hours outside. There are stray dogs, kids etc who try to scare him but as of now he is able to well handle himself.     Will neutering him reduce his aggression &amp; thereby reduce his ability to protect himself? He is not particularly a very aggressive or fighting cat, but he can handle himself.  What other behaviour changes can I expect after neutering? "
627,How much my pug puppy should eat,"I have some basic questions about my 1-year-old pug.    How much should he eat? Typically he should eat 2 times, but he always keeps some food in his bowl and whenever he wants he eats. Is this a good practice? (I use Royal Canin Mini Adult) Now-a-days he always wants what I'm eating. How to stop this?   I'm too new (being my first pet) in this area, so your views are appreciated.  "
628,How to deal with dogs dental issues?,"My girlfriend has a 6 year old Chihuahua/Pug named Willow.  She has HORRIBLE breathe! The worst I have ever smelled in a dog. I always said ""this is not normal, go get this checked out"", and my girlfriend said that vet said she is ok.  Now Willow is sick and lethargic. She took her to the vet, and they are not certain what is wrong so they gave her antibiotics....and they also said ""Her front teeth may need to be extracted"".  First off, how do you go from ""being ok"" to ""needing to be extracted""??  Is this vet doing a sub par job? Should I recommend she find a new vet?  Secondly, what step can be taken to improve Willows dental hygiene and health? She is a very healthy and happy dog otherwise, and I would hate for this to become a serious issue for her! "
629,1yo Mastiff puppy is jumping and kissing / poking people in the face,"This is my second dog I've owned. He's my first boy-dog and any dog this big. He's a Mastiff Boxer mix with a brindle coat. My last 12year dog was a female black lab that past away 18 months ago. My new dog is totally AMAZING! and I love him in the same way I loved my last dog. But there is a new alarming behavior that I need to work on immediately! I need help and advice.   Like I said, he is an amazing puppy with lots and lots of puppy energy and happiness. For the last couple of months when I take him to the dog park he has this habit of jumping up and ""kissing"" people... like bopping his snout against peoples faces. It's pretty impressive because he has a 5 foot vertical leap on all four paws... like he's bouncing up and kissing you at mouth level. It's really cute and most people don't seem to mind it (because it's a dog park).    But a few days ago he was doing the same behavior and an elderly lady yelled out loud ""GET YOUR DOG AWAY FROM ME!!!!!"" as he bopped her in the cheek. She seemed to be covering her cheek with her hand like she was hurt. At the time I thought maybe she was over-reacting? But I was concerned so I immediately leashed him up and took him home. I've been taking him back to the dog park each day since. So today I go out to the park with him to get his exercise, and there was this nice woman at the park with her dog and my boy bounced up again and ""kissed"" (or bopped) her in the nose and she got a mild bloody nose from that. That was the second warning sign and now I'm really concerned! What do I do? I need advice from experts. I DO NOT WANT A LAW SUIT OR MY DOG BEING PUT DOWN for being aggressive. He's absolutely not. He's just a Mastiff puppy with a very happy life.  My first plan is to start using the shock collar at the park. And only shock him when he jumps up at people. He WILL NOT listen to my verbal commands if he's really engaged in play. I feel like going to the shock collar is the best method to give him what he wants (play in the dog park) and give me what I want (doggy exercise and discipline ) without the risk of having people hurt by his jumping. He's really a big puppy and I want the best for him.   If there is a better (more expedient) solution then the shock collar I'm open to suggestions. Many many thanks for all of your suggestions. "
630,Cat Vocal Exercises for a cat with a quiet voice?,"Ok, I know this one is sort of weird but here it is: Is there any sort of vocal exercises for my cat?  Backstory: I had a few cat's and I enjoyed hearing them purr, mew and etc. The problem is that my current cat sounds... weak?!?  When me and my wife adopted him, he was about 2 months old, with pink eye and a flu. We nursed him back to health and he looks pretty healthy now (he has 6 months already) but in comparison with the previous cats I had, his mews seem miserable. My worry is that he got his lungs underdeveloped due to sickness when he was a little kitten (he is like 2 kg now).  So far I make him 'beg' every time I prepare wet food for him, and award him with a full bowl every time he starts mewing loud enough. But it doesn't seem enough.  My question is:     Is there anything else I can do and should I be worried about his weak voice? "
631,Why does my dog rub her chin on stuff?,"I have a Dachshund puppy, Peanut. As she is a breed originating as a small creature hunter, she displays some characteristics of that breed. Where my Labrador would point out dead animals, and might sniff around them, he would mostly leave them be. Peanut, however, will stalk small varmints/birds, and if I let her, chase them down, including down their holes/up trees. I understand this behavior.  When I'm walking Peanut, if she happens across a carcase, she'll pick it up and either attempt to eat it, or carry it back to our yard ""for later"" snacking. :) I discourage this behavior.    Sometimes, however, when we are walking, she'll stop, sniff once or twice (and I usually can't even see what she is sniffing, beyond maybe a spot on the sidewalk), and then kneel down and lay her chin and throat on the spot and kind of rub. (No jokes about a Dachshund not needing to kneel, please). This behavior has me absolutly baffled.    As I understand it, a cat has some (sweat?) glands in their chins that they use to leave a scent, but I didn't think dogs have that.    Note that it's not the ""roll around in trash"" behavior. She doesn't actually lay down on either her stomach or back, she just... ""lays her throat and chin"" in the, I guess smell?  I would also add that we got Peanut from a litter my father's dog sired with a friend's Dachshund, so she's purebred. We got her at around 7 weeks, and she's done this behavior since then. She doesn't do it all the time (every walk), but only when she finds a whatever-it-is.    I've never owned a hound breed before. Is this a Dachshund thing? A hound thing? or a Peanut thing?  Peanut's odd behavior  Here is a video of the behavior, although this is the most she has done it. She's never twisted like this before, just set her chin straight down. In this video I guess it is the equivalent of ""rolling around in trash."" "
632,Under gravel or sand filter for aquarium,"Is it better to have an under gravel filter than the traditional out of water filter that sits on top of the aquarium?  I keep an air hose on during the day that blows bubbles and have live plants.     Edited: Currently, I have the lots of plants and cipher the gravel every 1 to 2 weeks.  My fish seem healthy and happy.   I just don't want nitrate to build up or toxins to be release in the water.  So which method is best for keeping that perfect balance in the aquarium? "
633,"One of my danios died, will the other two be okay by themselves?","In my fish tank I had three danios, but one of them died. They're schooling fish, so will that effect anything?

635,Can cats see equally well in both light and dark?,"I know that the cats can see in the dark, but I have been wondering: Can cats see as well in the dark as they do in the light?  Or do they see better in the light? "
636,Why would my yellow-bellied sliders completely reject light and dryness?,"I have two yellow-bellied sliders(trachemys scripta scripta). The water is more than 6cm tall, the aquarium is 50cm x 30cm, and the turtles are like 7cm long. The aquarium is indoor. They have semi-direct sunlight (there's the window in the middle), a heater, and two gadgets:   one bridge, which grants them shadow and also they can walk over to have dry ground. a rocky mountain -actually I think it should be bigger- in which a turtle fits perfectly.   I read that turtles need a dry space and sunlight, but most of the time I see them under the bridge. They don't struggle for the space at all. If I move them manually to the dry mountain or above the bridge, they immediately fall back below the bridge.  Under what conditions is it normal that they want to reject the whole time the dry grounds and the light? Is it somehow a sign of sickness? "
637,When and for how long can my hamster safely play in a hamster ball?,"I know there is a special ball for hamsters, which they get in start to moving in; it's called a Hamster Ball.  I want to buy one for my hamster, but I have two questions:    At what age can a hamster start to play in the ball?  My hamster is about 40 days old: can he play in the ball?  How much time should he be allowed to play in the ball?  "
638,How can I tell if my shrimp is pregnant?,Two of my five ghost shrimp are really bloated. They have no trouble staying at the bottom of the tank.   Are they pregnant? What is up?   
639,Is dog food made specifically for Yorkie better than dog food made for all dogs?,"I am about to get a new Yorkie puppy from a breeder. She currently feeds her dogs Blue Diamond dog food. From what I have read online, been told by breeders, and pet shops, that isn't recommended food. It's not very good.  Most of the dogs I have had were a Siberian Huskies and I have always given them ""Taste of the Wild"". There are some kinds of dog food that are advertised as being made specifically for Yorkies.  Would it be better if I fed my yorkie dog food that was made specifically for Yorkies? Or would it be fine if I fed it the same food as I have the huskies? "
640,Are dogs good at remembering people?,"I have a miniature Schnauzer, who is 4 years old. I was married for 5 years, and my wife,  my dog, and I lived together for 2 years.   But 2 years ago I got divorced, and the dog is now living with me only. Our divorce was too troubled so I decided to deny my wife the ability to see the dog. In these 2 years, I've never seen my ex-wife and I never let her see or stay with our dog.   Last week my ex-wife talked with me about seeing our dog. Since too much time has passed, I thought maybe it was time to let them meet again.  But to my surprise my dog didn't like to see her. He growled and barked at her, and didn't let her cuddle him, and fled near me. It was too strange.  When we were married, he was very close to her. He slept in her arms. But why does he behave like this now?  Can my dog ​​understand the heartache I feel about my ex-wife? Or is it only that he doesn't recognize her any more? "
641,"Is the ""Million Bubble Air Pump"" necessary for the long-term health of sea-monkeys?","I got my son a Sea-Monkey set several months ago.    It's just a very basic set, which had the eggs, the plastic tank, some food, and a feeding spoon.  It's been doing very well, and we've had multiple generations of sea-monkeys, but the instructions suggested that we should get a special aerator:     Sea-Monkey Million-Bubble Air Pump . . . $4.00    A MUST to oxygenate their water!!! No electricity or batteries needed! In fact, IT CANNOT WEAR OUT OR BREAK! Just pump the bellows with your thumb, just once a day, to FILL the Sea-Monkey water with MILLIONS of bubbles that carry life-supporting oxygen. Perfect for REALLY SERIOUS Sea-Monkey owners.   Is there any actual benefit to this?  Will using one have a noticeable impact on either the individual lifespan of the shrimp, or the long-term survival of the ecosystem? "
642,Can adding spinach / pineapple / pumpkin to a dog's diet prevent coprophagia?,"I'm trying to deter my dog from eating his own feces. I've heard that adding spinach or pineapple or pumpkin to his diet can help contain the problem, preventing this act by making the poop unappealing.   Is this true, and is there scientific evidence to back it up, or is it only anecdotal? If this is true, how much of any should be used?  I'm assuming the amount varies based on dog weight, but I want a guideline. Does canned or fresh work better?  I assume canned for pumpkin, but I don't know about pineapple.   For pineapple, should I just add juice, chunks, or both? For spinach (suggested from the comments below), should I use fresh spinach or frozen (obviously not creamed)?  Should I cook it first?  "
643,Does a cat recognize her offspring after a long period of separation?,"My cat had some kittens a while ago, one of which I have given to a friend.  It has been about a year since then, and I was wondering: If my cat (the mother) were to come in contact with her offspring after not seeing it for a while, will the mother still know the other cat is its offspring?  Cats usually sniff each others behinds to catch their scent, which in the animal world, its basically their handshake (for certain categories of animals, such as dogs. Please correct me if I'm wrong). Even after a long period of separation, will the scent of the offspring set off a motherly instinct, or any kind of trigger, thatll allow the mother to know if the cat she's interacting with is infact her offspring?  If they can or can't recognize them by scent, is there another way she would be able to recognize them? (if the father spent time with the offspring and also with the mother cat at different times, and the mother and offspring haven't seen each other since birth. When they first meet, will the mother know its her offspring?) "
644,Can I run Undergravel Filter in Reverse to Keep the Gravel Clean?,"I current have a 75 gallon, unplanted aquarium in which I have NO gravel at all. I removed the gravel years ago because I liked the clean look&hellip; and not having to vacuuming the gravel to remove debris. I really liked that look for awhile, but now I'm looking for a change.  I would like to cover the bottom of the aquarium with a thin layer of gravel, but I am trying to avoid the chore of having to vacuum it again. The gravel would be for aesthetic purposes only (I am not using it to anchor plants).  Would a water pump (or the output of my canister filter?) circulating water UPWARD through an underground filter likely negate the need to vacuum a very thin layer of gravel at all?  The gravel would only need to be a fraction of an inch thick (just enough to cover the undergravel plates). I am not planning on using it to anchor plants. Is this something people do? Does the equipment for this type of setup/configuration already exist, or am I going to have to jury rid something to give it a shot? "
645,Leaving red-eared sliders for the weekend,"I recently began caring for a red-eared slider. It is still young and small, approximately 4 inches in length from the head to tail. I typically feed him dried meal worms daily. I am leaving town from Friday night until Monday afternoon. Is it okay for me to leave him in his tank? Can I just leave more food than normal? Or should I transport him in a smaller container and continue caring for him while I am gone?  Thanks in advance for any help! "
646,Do cats recognize their family? Perhaps by scent?,"Is there any scientific or anecdotal evidence that cats recognize other cats who closely share their DNA? As in, new kittens from the same mother and the such?  I'm suspecting that there might be such a thing, and what follows is my reasoning for doing so.  I adopted my (once feral) cat when she was about 6 months old, from the area around my summer home. Ever since she has lived with me in a city flat. About a month ago, I moved back to the summer home for a while, taking her along.  Interestingly, she seemed to instantly recognize her surroundings, from which she was taken almost a year ago: Once she was allowed to go outside the house, she went out as if she already owned the entire garden. She didn't take her time to explore gradually, as she seems to have done with pretty much every other new area she's been.   There is a number of feral cats in the area. One of them, about 5-6 months old, looks extremely alike my own cat, both in terms of fur length (she has medium-lengthed fur, which is unusual for feral cats in my country), color, markings and so on. It's not unlikely at all that they're sisters from another birth, or that the kitten is my cat's niece.   This kitten is the ONLY cat or kitten I've seen in the area that my cat doesn't feel threatened by or attack at all. Over the last few weeks, I've seen her get defensive or aggressive, or at least meow at every single other cat around. With her kitten double, she just stares with apparent curiosity.  I've heard stories of cats seemingly recognizing their owners' close family as soon as they meet them; my logic tells me it must be hormonal, or otherwise related to smell - naturally, siblings and the such smell alike. But can it happen the other way round?  I highly doubt my cat understands that this kitten looks like her, but do you think there's a chance she recognizes it through scent? "
647,"If a cat tries claiming dominance over its mother, should I stop it?","I've seen my cats bite each other, and after some research, I found that it was the cat claiming dominance (letting the other cat know ""I'm the Alpha"").  What surprised me was that one of my cats (named Fearless) started doing it to his mom, and the mother (named Booboo) didn't like it at all. It hasn't broken out into huge fights (yet), but the two seem eager to show who's the Alpha. Fearless is about 9 months old now, if that makes a difference. The mother cat is around 6 years old.  My Question:  Should I prevent the offspring from claiming dominance in this situation? Is it a bad thing for the offspring to be the dominant one? In our world, the offspring showing dominance would be frowned upon, but the cat world seems to have some exceptions.  Some other details about home-life for my cats (which relate to this situation): The mother cat has another offspring (named Fatty (not actually fat though)) that doesn't do this, although it seems as if Fatty is starting to hop on the bandwagon by giving the mother difficulties during bath time (which hasn't happened since Fearless decided to start showing dominance towards Booboo). Fatty and Fearless are from the same litter. If both were to show dominance over the mother, would this trigger some emotional effect and make the mother depressed? (This is more of a bonus question; would be nice to get the answer, but answering the main question alone is good enough for best answer.) "
648,How can I get my cat to stop nursing from its mother?,"My cat is 9 months old, and she still likes to nurse from her mother. I've been stopping her (also punishing her by removing her from the room we are currently in. Is this a bad way to react?) when I see her do it, but no results come of it.  She eats regular catfood as well. I don't think the mother cat is still producing milk (it's been a few months since she had kittens). I have a feeling it's a bonding thing, because the mother doesn't mind at all (cleans offspring while offspring is feeding).  Although this brings up many other questions (each deserving their own post), my main question is: How can I get my 9 month old cat to stop nursing off its mother?  "
649,What effects could long-term nursing have on a cat?,"I have a cat thats 9 months old. The mother ended up getting pregnant again shortly after (fixed now, so no more worries), which lead to one of my cats to continue nursing after being introduced to regular dry cat food. Only one of the two kittens from that litter chose to continue nursing AND eat regular kitten food.  After the birth, we litter trained the kittens and had to give them to some family friends (sadly, I can't have an army of cats at my house). After the fact, we noticed that one of the kittens from the litter before is STILL nursing on her mother.  Other than not being as big as her brother (same age, but male. I'm guessing it's a gender thing), she seems perfectly fine.  How can nursing affect a 9 month old cat who also eats regular cat food? How could it affect a cat that doesn't eat regular cat food, and chooses to only nurse? "
650,What illnesses/symptoms should I look for with a new cat?,"We are adopting a new (rescue) cat next weekend. The rescue that we are getting him from recommends a 7-10 day isolation period before we introduce him to our current cats to make sure that he isn't ill and doesn't transmit any illnesses to our other cats.  What illnesses and/or illness symptoms should I be on the lookout for?  Part of the recommended integration period also recommends taking bedding that smells like him and putting it where our other cats can smell it and vice versa (so they can smell each other before meeting). Should I wait to do this until after the isolation period, or a certain number of days through the isolation period to make sure that he doesn't have a skin disease?  Finally (out of curiosity), I have medical records on our new cat for the past month (his second worming is tomorrow, he's had FeL/FIV testing, etc). If this was a stray cat off the street, would the isolation period be longer/different? "
651,Dog agility training: what mistakes should be avoided to obtain only fast responses,"I started to introduce me and my dog to the sport of agility some time ago. Helped with the book Agility Right From the start I clicked trained him to the tunnel, high jumps and we're progressing with the weave poles.  I think I must admit that I'm still a total beginner and I'm afraid that my training technique would drag us in a direction where my dog will know how to perform the obstacles but where we'd have only slow/not that fast responses.  Are there some rules that would ensure that we won't do that mistake? "
652,Training stray cats for Feeding time,"I have 5 stray cats that have been visiting my house over the last 2-3 months sporadically (1-2 times a week). Of late, I have started setting out adult cat food for them and I see that their frequency of visits has increased.   Now they follow a set time-table. Cat 1 visits between 9-9.30am and eats all the food! I set more food out at 9.30am and Cat 2 visits at around 11.00am and eats about half of it. Cat 1 and Cat 3 visit between noon-3pm and feed on the leftovers. Then I put food out again at around 6pm again and Cat 1 visits at around 6.30-7pm. Cat 4 and Cat 5 are only sporadic visiters.  Given that background, my questions are:    How do I ensure that Cat 2 doesn't go hungry since from next week I start work and will be in my office between 9am-7pm. I'm on vacation right now and hence it isn't difficult for me to put food out in the middle of the day since I am home. I would rather not resort to some fancy battery operated, timing gadget since I cannot quite afford anything beyond $10-15. Also, do cats ""learn"" if I time my feeding and restrict it to setting out food at 8am (before I head to work) and 7pm (after I return from work)? Will I be losing some of my frequent visiters if they perceive that I don't put food out any more in the middle of the day? I plan on traveling out of the country for a month - is there some feeding strategy I can use to ensure they have food when I am gone? I can't quite ask my neighbors.   More info  I checked with my the building syndicat. They have no problem with me feeding stray cats.  "
653,Entertaining a house-bound high energy dog,"I have a one year old border collie who has kennel cough. He is vaccinated, I'm not sure how he got it, but here we are.  He is confined to the house/yard, and he is losing his mind. He normally goes to doggy daycare twice a week that sort of relaxes him, but he hasn't been able to do that since he got sick.  He plays fetch poorly, maybe for about 5 minutes max, so it hasn't helped in exercising him. I've been using a laser pointer to take the edge off, but he gets bored of that too.  We do about an hour of clicker shaping/training in the evening, which I think mellows him out a little. But not enough.  Other things I've tried:   Frozen Kongs - he will eat the easy stuff off the top and leave the Kong until it defrosts. Bully sticks - actually pretty good, buys me about 20 minutes of free time Bones - also about 20 minutes worth of entertainment at a time Snuffle mat - we do this for about 30 minutes, but I don't know if it does too much. ""Find it"" game - he doesn't seem to get the idea. He gets the easy ones and lays down. Flirt pole - gets bored after about 5 minutes. RC car - works great, but he barks and herds and it gets kinda loud. Plus I don't want to encourage the barking.   I am looking for ideas for entertaining a high energy dog that doesn't require me to spend all of my free time after work doing it. Games? Fun toys? I want to avoid high-calorie activities because he also isn't exercising too much. "
654,How fast does a rabbit get attached as a pair?,"How fast does a rabbit get attached as a pair? I’d like to separate but not lose a bunny due to loneliness. They have been together in two groups. One having two bunnies and one having three bunnies.  I got all five together. Some were siblings to each other. So I paired together two siblings. And of the remaining three two were siblings to each other. The third one favored one of these two siblings. So I paired the three together.  At first they were all five together.  Then maybe a week went by and I separated them into the above said two groups. Then I wanted to maximize the kennel cages to give them more space and separated all of them except the one set of smaller bunnies.  Now I have them in four cages. Three cages having one each and the fourth cage having two.  They have been separated now for two days. I got these bunnies a month ago. And they had been paired for three weeks before I separated them.  Will they be okay, happy and not lonely now? Right before the cold, is this wrong to do as well? Or would they rather snuggle together to stay warm? "
655,Is it stressful for cats to be able to birdwatch/hunt from inside but never actually be able to make a kill (indoor only)?,"My orange tabby is a happy and friendly indoor (ONLY - THIS IS IMPORTANT AS SHE NEVER GETS A CHANCE TO HUNT ANYTHING - bugs, birds, or anything else) middle-aged female. I have a glass slider in my kitchen that leads to a deck. I had put up an acrylic see-through bird feeder on the outside of the glass with the included suction cups. Eventually the birds started showing up and cat was very interested. She would stalk and hunt as the birds came and went. She would jump up to try and attack (feeder was about 5 foot above the deck) -- obviously never succeeding at the catch but often making a huge racket as she careened through the vertical blinds.  I don't speak cat, so it's hard to tell but it almost seemed like she would be stressed during/after these ""hunts"".   Is this stressful to her? To be able to see all these critters; to stalk and jump at them - coming within the thickness of double-pane glass from success to no avail time and time again? She has plenty of toys inside - scratch pads, fake mice, balls, towers. It really seemed to be a big interest while it was up, but I am concerned that the fun/excitement of the hunt might be outweighed by never making the catch.   Am I just anthropomorphizing this or is there any evidence that this might actually be harmful?  Update  Another fact is that I adopted her when she was at or around 2 years old. Her history prior was/is unknown so it is possible that she survived by hunting for most of the beginning of her life. I suppose it is possible that having this memory could be cause for stress if were able to hunt/watch but never get a kill.  "
656,Camping with two puppies in December,"two puppies in December I like camping, and I am seriously considering winter camping with my puppies weather allowing. I am not concerned about mysef in the least (I've slept comfortably multiple times around -9 Celsius/15 Fahrenheit, crappy and cold around -15 Celsius/0 Fahrenheit) . I usually camp without a tent, with my sleeping bag, a waterproof overbag and a tarp in case it gets really rainy or windy. December in Toronto is typically between +3/-3 Celsius (40 to 25 Fahrenheit), says Google.  I am fine with that for myself, concerned for the puppies. I will have by then a 5 months German Shepherd and a 8 months Border Collie. They might get wet during the hike (they will definitely find something to roll in). Both indoor dogs. No significant fire because rules (I am not going far from the city, safety first).  Is it too much? Not sure that puppies can handle the cold if they are wet from the hike.  Would a tent help? Not sure how the puppies would behave themselves in the tent, or if I'll end up with well-chewed pieces of tent. "
657,"Moving into new house, neighbours have sensitive dog","I am moving house and on visits to inspect the property before moving in, the neighbours dog would bark very aggressively whenever I went out to the back garden. The dog does not bark when I am inside the house. There is a big fence between the houses so the dog can't see me and I can't see the dog and the dog can't get through.  What can I do to stop this barking? Is it just a case of ""introducing"" myself to the dog and how to ask the neighbour to arrange this.  Also, I hope to get a new dog too so should I do something similar with this new dog?  I won't be accepting any answers though until the occasion has passed and this could be a while in the making. "
658,What is the level of effort for this fish tank?,  One a scale of 1 to 10 (10 being metaphysically impossible) what is the level of effort to start and maintain a salt water tank with coral and fish (like the picture) for an amature?  I currently have a 10gal fresh water tank with tetras.  Secondary question: Can a fresh water version be created? 
659,Streamlining Aquarium for Frequent Travel,"Currently, I have a planted 30gal tank with a male betta and a few shrimp/snails. I'm very attached to my fish, and enjoy the ability to give him a tank much larger than the average pet-store betta fish.  Unfortunately, I am now facing a series of significant moves over the next few months/years, including some weeks of loosely structured car travel. These moves will involve spending several days at a time traveling (mostly by car), with occasional long stops. While I can set up a full tank whenever I stop for a few weeks, my 30gal takes up a ton of space in my vehicle, and it's nearly impossible to transport without draining. There's also the matter of getting set up at each new location and ensuring the water continues to cycle properly.  In short, I think my life is going to be way too stressful for my fish.  How do I cope with this?  In past, I have traveled with him in a large pickle jar. While I can't really heat or filter the water, it at least gives him somewhere safe to travel when we're in the car.   Has anyone had success creating some kind of ""travel tank""? Something that you can easily transition from house to house without introducing extreme stress? "
660,Why is my cat eating so much plant leaves and young stems from the garden?,"I know that some cats eat plant leaves and then vomit it to clean their digestive track.  But in case of my cat she is behaving almost as if she is a goat. I often see her eating young leaves and stems of flowering plants in garden. It is to such an extent that some herbs are without leaves in their lower portions.  To my astonishment, if I tear a young stem with young leaves and hold it in front of her, she ends up eating it fully. This behavior is almost akin to a goat.  Also she never vomits anything. She is in fine health. And in her litter box I never find any plant material.  I normally don't stay with my cat and she stays with my mom. She has been shifted to this new house 7 months back. Here she has access to the garden where there are lots of flowering plants with young leaves and stems. And my mom says that this behaviour of her is going on for the past 7 months.  So what exactly is happening?  How can an obligate carnivore end up eating plants? "
661,Neighbourhood cat poops and pukes in my garden and driveway,"Sorry, cat lovers, you're gonna hate me for this one.  I don't mind cats (or dogs, birds, etc.) but I very specifically don't want a pet in my household. Yet I have a problem that I'm unsure of how to deal with in a reasonable way. This is all in Denmark, so US laws and customs may not apply.  This year, a cat has been pooping in our garden, and ripping out grass or whatever else was around the scen of the crime, to cover it up. I obviously don't want this to continue (I would like my garden un-ripped, and my two small daughters would prefer it un-pooped-in also). It also has been leaving little puke pies around our cars in the drive way, which are quite disgusting, too.  But how do I stop the cat? I have tried planting ""scaredy cat"" plants, whose smell were supposed to discourage cats from coming near, but they don't work. I have also tried putting down metal webbing in the flower beds (because I heard that they don't like to step on such things and/or can't dig in it), and while that worked I can't extend that practice across my entire lawn.  Local law says that it's the responsibility of the pet owner to make sure that one's pet does not annoy others. This means I should go talk to the owner of said cat and ask them to keep the cat out of my garden. To which I would object: (a) I am convinced that no cat owner would agree to confining their cat because it roams in places that other people don't want it to; and (b) I don't even know whose cat this is! I have caught a glimpse of one cat, and followed it to the garden of a neighbour who has a cat door in their front door -- I am aware that this says absolutely zero about whether it's their cat or not. I have obviously not been able to read the chip or tattooed number in the cat's ear either.  I am considering ways of capturing this cat, so that I can either have a proper talk with it, or drive it to a shelter. How would I do that without breaking too many rules and laws?  Edit, as more info about (my relationship with) the HOA was requested. We are 37 households, and only we and 2 others have (small) kids -- the rest are pensioners. We are talking with only two other households; there is not a lot of communal spirit here -- the first HOA meeting I attended, about a week after we moved in, made it clear to me (in ways I shall not go into here) just how hostile, ludicrously infantile, and petty these people are (even towards each other, not just ""newcomers""). Later, I requested that the run-down communal play area receive a bit of maintenance, only to be shot down rather rudely. I am decidedly not in good standing in their minds, and that is why I cannot think they would be very inclined to help me avoid their shit in my garden.  Update I did not want anything water-driven, as just tonight the temperatures went to 6 degrees below freezing. But I've now installed a pair of these ultrasonic ""cat scarers"", hoping they work. There's a number of such devices, and common for them all is at least 40% one-star reviews and a minority of 5-star reviews; these ones are one of the few models with the ""best"" (which does not imply good) reviews.

662,Can dogs have almond milk?,"It may be the case the dogs can drink cows milk, but is almond and/or soy milk bad for your dog? Is it only bad in excess? I typically allow my dog to clean my breakfast bowl when I'm done, but I haven't seen harsh side effects as of yet. "
663,Feeding guides help Kirkland for cats,"My cat weights 10 pounds. I am reading the feeding guides and it says that a cat of that weight should eat 1/2 - 2/3 cups per day. I do not have a scale, but I do have a vase with millilitre marks on it. How many millilitres should I give him per day? A quick conversion would say 236.5 millilitres. However the guideline also says: 4008 kcal/kg (443 kcal/cup), which yields 110 grams per cup. I have found on the internet that ""A 44 pound bag of dog food would contain 176 cups of dog food in each bag"". Is there any Kirkland user that could corroborate that 236.5 millilitres of Kirkland food matches the 110 grams? Thanks!!  Here is the feeding guideline:   "
664,What's the name an air-valve that automatically closes for a set period of time to allow air to pass down the line to other valves?,I hope the title makes sense.  Essentially what I need is to use a single air pump to aerate multiple small tanks.  To do that I can't have the first few valve/air-stones in the entire line use up all the air.  Is there a type of non-electronic valve that automatically closes and stays closed for set intervals to allow air pressure to build further down the line?  If not how about electronic ones?

It has healed and there is a stump there but it doesn't seem to be growing anymore.  The stump is about the size of her head so OK but not back to it's original size.  She is a bit retarded so I never know what to expect.  Is this normal? am I missing something? 
668,"What do you call the cat sound that comes out from the throat like ""pigeons""?","I looked all over the net, but I couldn't find the answer.

670,Why my cat uses paws to bring food from plate to floor and then eats it from floor?,"My cat doesn't like to eat from plate. She rather likes to eat from floor.   In case of large food such as a piece of fish she will kick the food on plate a few times. Then she grabs the piece with mouth and puts it down on floor. Then she will go on kicking, eating some, kicking again, and so on. In this process she will make the whole floor dirty.  In case of solid food like tuna flavored whiskas, she will use her paws to bring one of the tiny pieces to floor. Then she will play football with it. Then she eats it. In this process lots of pieces remain lying here and there and the costly food is wasted. Moreover there is problem of red ants over here who takes full advantage of food lying here and there.  So why my cat does this? Is there any way to teach her not to do this?  She has lots of toys to play with. It is not that she doesn't get to play. "
671,Cat won't let me sleep at night,"My girlfriend's cat will not let me get a full night of sleep. I already have to work around our party-to-the-night neighbors and the get-up-early-with-high-heels neighbors; so this is really annoying.  Basically the cat will always start meowing when she comes from the litter box, and she does not use the litter box silently. She always scratches her paws on the sides, I presume for cleaning them. This takes a couple of minutes, and unfortunately our condo does not damp noises at all. This happens several times during the night.  Usually our bedroom door is open, she will come in and start meowing. This wakes us up, my girlfriend will tap on the bed or her chest. Sometimes the cat will just jump on her chest and cuddle and be quiet. Most times, however, the cat will just respond with more meowing, I guess she wants to play. We don't want to play, but seems to be an alien concept for her.  When the door is closed, she will scratch on the door. This again is loud enough to wake at least me up. We have tried opening the door a crack and then spray the cat. That does not seem to be a sufficient deterrent to let us sleep. Also when either of us goes to the bathroom at night, the cat will sneak into the bedroom. Curiously the cat will then quietly lay on my girlfriend's chest and purr otherwise quietly. After a while the cat leaves silently again.  Right now it seems that the cat is training us. I am already indifferent to all the hair and cat litter in bed, I am almost used to open up doors for the self proclaimed princess. However, I would like to get a full night of sleep again.  Other questions seem to address similar points, but either I do not have enough patience or they are not compatible with this cat.   How to get my cat to stop being annoying at night?  The answers there say that the cat is bored (which I would assume applies here as well) and one should try to make other rooms entertaining. It seems that my girlfriend's cat does not like playing with stuff much, it likes to cuddle with everyone, literally everyone. When there are guests, the cat will try to get on everyone's lap. So her toys seem to be all humans around. And they are now in the bedroom.  When we have guests sleeping in our condo, the cat usually stays with them in the living room. So making a different room interesting does work, but it needs other people.  Expelling the cat from the bedroom has only lead to scratching on the door. The spray bottle has not removed that behavior, so I am woken up either way. My cat wakes me up at night pawing at my door  First answer says to never open the door. So not use the spray bottle but ignore the cat? That might work. The diabolical thing is that once I am woken up I usually need to go to the bathroom in order to have a chance of getting to sleep again. So then eventually I need to open the door. Should I get a camping toilet for the bedroom‽  The second answer says that one just cannot close the door. In consequence, this also means that one just cannot have a full night of sleep, a bed free of cat litter or any of those things. Moving has caused my cat&#39;s night-life to eat away at my actual life  There it is suggested to play with the cat. I had done this the yesterday, actually. This cat seems to only respond to cuddling and light play. When there is hard light, she will try to catch the shadow of her tail. I played with a laser pointer (which is eye safe as determined by a fellow physicist and an eye doctor) and got her to the point of exhaustion where she was panting. But apparently that does not do a significant difference. My cat is keeping me awake at night  Suggestion is to react in a way that the cat does not want. We certainly do not do that now. But what can I do when only I wake up and my girlfriend does not? I could wake her up and tell her to do something with the cat. But cuddling tightly is just exactly what the cat wants. And getting sprayed with water does not seem a big deterrent.  Giving the cat away to my girlfriend's parents is what we did when we went on vacation. In their larger house, the cat usually is quiet and does not nag us to play at night. They have their own cat, a rather old male who is not very active due to back pain. They do not seem to get along too well, but sufficiently to only occasionally hiss at each other. When the cat is back in our condo, it is the old behavior. Giving the cat away to them for the whole time would fix my sleep problem, but my girlfriend would be unhappy about that.  Another person writes that they feed their cat manually (we just have a bowl with food for self-service). The cat wakes them up to get food. Sounds like exactly the wrong direction for me.   It seems that it will take quite some time until I can have a full night of sleep again. So what do I do with this renitent cat which has already gained so much ground in the war over authority? "
672,Why do dogs chase and fight with cats?,"I have always wanted to know why dogs chase cats. I read on the internet but it doesn't has any good reason or theories except that dogs chase away anything that is running. But then what if the cats just stay in their position? According to the theory, the dog shouldn't do anything but they will still fight. So why do they fight? Thank You. "
673,Why does mother cat attack me if I clean kitten's pee?,"My cat attacks whoever cleans her kittens pee or pooh. Except if it was me cleaning it. Why? What does she think of this? If I cleaned it, she'd just check the clothe and it's over. It seems shes satisfied. If anyone else comes near the pee of her kittens it's war. She allows her kittens to be handled and played with though. "
674,Cat suddenly scared and won't come in,"My cat, Cali, was feral after the neighbors abandoned her. I think they had abused her. She gradually worked  her way into our home after a year of being skittish and running away while we fed her outside. We lived in Hawaii where being outdoors was safe. Cali gradually became more affectionate, and seemed to want to be an indoor cat after having always been outdoors, going out for about 15 minutes daily at most.   Then two months ago we moved her to California and kept her indoors. It seemed to be going well. She learned to use a litter box and started voluntarily climbing into my lap and sleeping with us at night. But as of a few weeks ago, she wanted to go outside and slipped out one day. After that, she cried incessantly, all day and all night, to be let out. I  tried to keep her in but she drove me nuts with constant, constant loud crying so I started letting her out during the day, assuming she'd come back for meals, which she did, and then we'd keep her in at night.   She was supposed to go to the vet for dental surgery today. I let her out before breakfast yesterday since she had been crying since 5 am, assuming she'd come back to eat as always. But for the first time, she didn't come back to eat. I made a huge mistake. I went looking for her, brought food to her, and when she was eating I tried to pick her up to bring her back into the house so she'd be around for the surgery. She freaked out, scratched me, and ran off. And since then, she's been in hiding. She hid outside all day yesterday and then last night I put her food inside the door to the living room, and she slunk in to get it, but rushed out as soon as she saw me approaching to close the door. She spent the night outside and hid all day today (missed the surgery).  I was worried because she didn't eat all day yesterday, so I left food outside on the porch this morning and I saw her eating it, so  I know she's around,  though she's been hiding all day. I call her every few hours and she won't come, so I left food out again tonight. It's gone so I assume she ate it,  but she won't come in or show herself, even though it's getting really cold.   To make matters worse, we're supposed to move in a few weeks. Cali was supposed to stay with a friend of mine for 8 days while my husband and I drove across country, and I bought my friend a ticket so she could fly Cali to us,  carrying her in the cabin. Now I'm  feeling like maybe I should just try to find someone to adopt her so she doesn't go through any more trauma, and also because she really can't be an outdoor kitty where we're headed.  Help!!!! Any advice???? "

677,Can I give my cat large amounts of food before leaving home?,"I'll be moving to my new apartment in +/- 2 years, and I plan on adopting a cat, since I always wanted one, but never could due to our dogs (which I also love).  But then I realized that his feeding times would be ""irregular"". I leave my home to go to work at 6:40AM and come back only at 5PM.   So, could I give him a reasonable ammount of food before leaving home and then he eats what he needs? Or would he overfeed himself? What other options do I have? "

679,How dangerous are lemons for a cat?,My 6 month old cat licked at a lemon slice but is behaving normally.  I've read on multiple websites that lemon is poisonous to cats (and dogs). However there are also some people that recommend to rub citrus peels against cords to prevent the cats from biting them. Indicating that lemons aren't poisonous.  That made me wondering are lemons really poisonous to cats or just some parts like the peel or the seeds? How much would cause serious problems to a cat?  Below are a few links that state that lemons are poisonous:   ASPCA All Pet Magazine Wagwalking  
680,Can I produce fish food from overcrowding shrimp?,"I recently moved my aquarium from my desk to a shelve and missed intensive inspections for a couple of months. I noticed that I don't have about 50 (which is already much), but a few hundred red cherry shrimp; population potentially growing. Since that might be stressful for all inhabitants in a 60l freshwater aquarium, I was wondering whether it's possible to reduce the number by producing fish food for Mollies from a bunch of them?  I'd start by killing them in a -21°C saturated salt water bath which should cause immediate deadly systemic shock. Then freeze and cut them and store them into my freezer. That way, I should be able to feed the pieces over time.  Freeze-drying would be a good conservation, but requires industrial equipment afaik.  Does this approach make sense: Will the meat remain consumable over - let's say - half a year? Can I cut up the whole bodies or do I need to peal the shrimp? Are there parts I should remove (organs filtering toxins, especially fat parts which are considered bad diet for aquarium fish)? "
681,My little red eared turtle ate a dead gold fish should I be concerned?,  This is my little red eared turtles image eating my pet gold fish which died of natural causes.  Should I be worried? Is there anything I should do?  
682,Looking for an automated aquarium,"I'm looking for a fully automated aquarium.    Need an automatically timed feeder for the fish Could the aquarium could automatically clean itself A battery backup for both the feeder and the cleaning could be good too!   I'm not sure whether aquariums need any oxygen system or not. Also, not sure if it's safe to leave an aquarium with fishes un-managed when going on a holiday.   Normally I turn the electricity off before leaving, so that's the main reason for the battery backup.   If a battery powered aquarium is not available, then   Is there any portable aquarium that's easy to carry?  Also, some easier way to transfer the fishes from one aquarium to another?    I've tried a net, and it's scary to move the fishes to another aquarium with it.  Thanks for any help! "
683,Strange dark scabbing near cat's nose,"My male cat is about 10 months old and I noticed a strange dark spot forming in/around his nose the past couple days. Originally I thought it was simply Feline Acne, as he had some on his chin that the Vet pointed out before. His chin has cleared up, but now this nose spot has appeared. I was going to ignore it as I thought it would pass like the chin acne, but my SO thinks it looks bad enough for a trip to the Vet. It is a crusty texture like the chin acne was.  Thoughts? Acne or maybe not?    "
684,Green Tree python refuses to eat,"I've had a green tree python for about a year now. She has been eating really well with no illnesses other than constipation when I first got her. However for the past few months she has been grounding herself frequently (2-3 days out of the week) and refusing to eat any mice. It has me concerned because nothing in her environment has changed and she is starting to get skinny. I've tried force-feeding her the head of a pinky mouse but she just regurgitated it. I could stick my hand in her mouth without her biting down on my hand or fingers. There is no physical signs of any illnesses. No redness, puss, nor any weird shaped teeth or other obvious deformities.   What can I do as far as feeding so she stops losing weight? Why is she not eating for these few months?  She is 4.5 feet long. Temperature averages at about 86 degrees Fahrenheit using a UV pad. I have a mister that sprays the cage 30 seconds every 2 hours. Humidity ~60 percent at all times. Been feeding adult mice. Cage is 3×3×3ft custom cage with plenty of varying perches.  "
685,How can I safely trim matted cat fur?,"Regarding What causes fur clumps on my cat&#39;s back, and how can I prevent them? , some severe cases of matted fur need to be removed through cutting or shaving.    As an electric shaver might spook a cat, are there any safety scissors that can be used?    What methods exist for an individual to perform a matted fur removal task safely?  "
686,Is it a good idea to allow my cats to eat leftovers / table scraps?,"One of our cats has a habit of jumping on the kitchen counter and chowing down on any leftover scraps from dinner. Personally, I don't mind this, as it's mostly ""licking the plate"" kind of stuff.   Does supplementing him this way adversely affect his diet to where we would want to discourage this behavior?  If it is okay, are there any foods we'll want to keep an eye out for our cats to avoid altogether? "
687,What is the importance of UV radiation to pet reptiles?,"I have no experience with reptiles.  I was reading Would putting a thin layer of plexiglass over a UV-B fixture in a reptile enclosure filter out a significant amount of light? and I would like an explanation as to why a special UV-A/UV-B bulb is necessary for their enclosures.    Does it keep them comfortable, simulating an environment, or is it a dietary need, or both? "
688,What indicates whether my outdoor goldfish are healthy or ill?,"I keep goldfish in large outdoor pots (homemade ponds).  Other than noting their swiftness when surfacing for food, it is difficult to determine if my goldfish are unwell.  It is only obvious they are sick when they start to float sideways; they usually die soon after.  I would like to be able to recognize sickness before they get to such a critical stage.  Is it a sign of good health when goldfish rise quickly and gobble up the food?  Are there other signs to indicate if my fish are healthy (or sick)?  "
689,How do I spot potential problem behavior when adopting a dog?,"Frequently people are adopting dogs from rescue shelters. Adopting any adult dog can be a bit of a challenge in that it's hard to know the dog's history. Some rescue dogs have a history of abuse and/or neglect. The process of meeting and choosing a dog doesn't give the dog or the people a great environment to get to know each other. Dog's can sometimes be different at a shelter.   Given the, sometimes, unnatural process of getting to know a possible future adopted dog;  Are there ways, when choosing a dog, to see if the dog has problem behavior?  This question originally discussed looking for potential health problems and signs of abuse when adopting a dog - it was separated into two questions.  What danger signs indicate health issues when aquiring a new dog? "
690,What harm will soap water do to my dog?,My dog just drank soap water that I left outside the house. I don't know what to do.  Will this negatively affect his health?  Should I take him to see a vet? 
691,"Can trace amounts of onions, or other foods poisonous to dogs, be harmful?","I'm asking this in response to the question:  Are onions dangerous for my cat or dog and why?  The above question concludes that onions and garlic are poisonous to dogs.  But what about trace amounts? If I feed table scraps to my dog that have only been seasoned with onions or garlic, is that still dangerous?  Some examples of what I'm referring to:   A piece of steak that has been marinated with a marinade that had onions in it. A hamburger that had onions on it(with the onions taken off) Pizza crust(which almost certainly has trace amounts of sauce which normally contains garlic)  "
692,Why do my dogs stand back to back when they mate?,"My dogs start off mating like many mammals, the male mounting the female. But they then turned away from each other during the process.  Why do they do this? What purpose would it serve? "
693,How do I manage a cat litter box to maximize hygiene?,"I have a genetic, incurable autoimmune disease. This causes me to be chronically immunocompromised.  Keeping a pet is a decision of weighing the benefits vs. possible health risks.  I've decided the benefits far outweigh possible health risks; this is my choice and a personal one.  Can contact with cat feces be harmful for pregnant women? explains it is unsafe for pregnant women to come into contact with cat feces. The same holds true for the immunocompromised.  Can someone advise me on how to manage a cat litter box to reduce possible contact with the litter and feces? "
694,Filtration of smaller ponds,I've asked some questions about my goldfish What indicates whether my outdoor goldfish are healthy or ill? and noticed a lot of response referring to the likelihood that fish would survive in such an unfiltered environment. Yet they have lived and thrived within this environment for a few years.   Is there a size limit to ponds that requires filtration? Could the plants be assisting in oxygenating and filtering the water? 
695,What non-fish animals are safest for my freshwater aquarium?,"I am filling a 55-gallon freshwater tank.  I am planning to add group fish, schooling fish, like guppies and tetras.  I am avoiding African Cichlids and solitary fish.   I am looking for additional, non-fish animals to add to the tank; crabs (hermit or otherwise) or shrimp or snails, for example.  I want to avoid destructive animals.  What should I be looking to add?  Is there anything I should explicitly avoid? "

697,Keeping pigeons and their droppings away from other pets,We have a large number of pigeons in our backyward and doing some research I have found that the histoplasmosis and cryptococcosis diseases carried in their feces can be harmful to cats and dogs. Searching around I've seen some suggested solutions although a lot really wouldn't be useful in our situation:   Barriers and various spices to keep them away where they roost - the yard is too open for barriers to be effective and they seem to fly in and wander around rather than nest in a particular area. Remove food sources - we did the obvious step of bringing the dog bowl back inside some time ago but we have a lot of trees and they seem quite content with amount of natural seed. Also we have budgies outside and while we try to sweep up the area often no doubt some sits there a while before we get to it. The various loud sound ideas wouldn't go down well in a residential area and I wonder if the ultrasonic options would also disturb our budgies and/or dog?   I don't know much about pigeons but one possible reason they may like to congregate here more than adjoining properties is that the previous owner used to breed / race them. Although that was close to twenty years ago so presumably it would have to be their offspring and I've never seen a sign of them actually nesting on the property.  We haven't had any problems so far with our pets contracting those diseases but the number seems to be on the increase. Given the above constraints does anyone have any other ideas that might be worth considering?  
698,Why do rabbits leave droppings at the Romp?,"Recently I was at a local shelter for a ""bun run"", where they let about 20 bunnies out for social time (some with each other, all with humans), and I noticed that even the ones who were supposedly litter-trained were leaving droppings during the run.    I know from What is required to house break a rabbit? that bunnies can be litter box trained, so why are they dropping poops all over the place?  How come they were not using litter boxes? "
699,I want to adopt cat(s) but my family has a relatively busy life. Should I? How?,"I'm a cat person. I just love cats. I want to adopt all kittens I see! :D     My background:      I live in a congested part of Nepal's capital city. I live with my   small family in a small house. All of us are usually busy at   office/college during work time (10am to 4pm).      I adopted a cat a few years ago. We couldn't control him from roaming   outside the house (for example, he would pop out the door suddenly   when we opened it). After few hours, we would hear his meows and as   soon as we opened the door, he would rush back in (probably to eat).   When we returned home after work, he would meow so desperately (as if   he was relieved to see us). But one day, he went out and never   returned. :(   I recently got a call from a friend that a tiny kitten has come at his place and was asking me if I wanted to adopt it. I definitely do want. But I definitely don't want another cat to leave us like that. Does adopting 2 or more cats help prevent it? (as we can't manage a pet-sitter here) Or does neutering the cat reduces it's eagerness to go out often?  How should I adopt cats? How do working people adopt cats? Or should I forget that cats exist? :/ "
700,Dog no longer trusts us or other dogs after bad foster home and vet experiences,"My dog was in a foster home with his brother and foster brother at around 3 weeks of age.  He was nipped by his brother and then bit by his foster brother in the exact same spot on his neck around 3 months of age, so he has always been sensitive to touching that area, but not aggressive, just became noticeably cautious if you would pet that area of his neck.  3 years later, after having a benign cyst removed from his ear, the vet tech ripped his bandages off in a very quick and seemingly painful way because our dog snapped and growled.   The ear was not yet healed, so we had to re-bandage the area, which caused more growling and snapping.  Since that day, he now responds with growling if we are near his neck area to check his ears or check him for ticks.  If we stay in that area too long, he snaps at us.  Additionally, since the vet tech incident, if he finds himself in a painful or upsetting situation such as recently when he pulled a leg muscle, he snapped and growled at my husband when he felt the pain while stretching near my husband.  It was as though he associated his pain with my husband, even though he pulled the muscle while running in the backyard.  My question is:  Is there training that can help us with this situation?  I feel like it’s difficult to fix a situation you can’t anticipate, i.e. I just know that sometimes if we touch his neck the “wrong” way, he growls, and if we have to keep touching the area, like when cleaning the ears he can snap and growl.  As another example of this, he used to have a toy that was a circle shape with a hole in the middle.  He flipped the toy over his head, so it ended up around his neck.  My husband went to take the toy off of his head, and he snapped at him.  So, he spent 15 minutes playing with a toy, then it went over his head, and it turned into a stressful terrible incident for him.  My concern going forward is that the odds of nothing painful ever happening to the dog are slim.  I’m wondering if there are training techniques that would help this situation? "
701,Cats and throat-hold -- accept or discourage?,"My turn to ask for help interpreting a behavior...  I have a pair of neutered sibling cats, Harry and Hazel, about 7 years old.  Periodically -- usually during a mutual grooming session -- Harry will grab Hazel's throat -- not scruffing, but under the chin as if going for a choke attack. He seems to be being gentle about it, and Hazel doesn't actively complain -- she'll go right back to washing him, even if he does it repeatedly -- but to human eyes this seems rude.  I've never seen Hazel apply the same hold.  Is this just ritual dominance/trust assertion, and should I stay out of it even when it happens virtually in my lap? Or should I discourage, since I'm supposedly the dominant cat in the clowder? (Dogs think they're inferior humans. Cats think we're incompetent cats.)  Not a behavior I've observed before, since in the past I've only had one cat at a time -- so I'd appreciate input from folks with years of observing interactions. My ape instinct is to say ""quit that"", but my cat instinct is that as long as they're still friends they should work it out themselves. "
702,Minimize litter box smell: upstairs or downstairs?,I have 3 cats and we are moving into a two story house.  We are considering two main locations for one or two large uncovered litterboxes: upstairs or downstairs.  Which location would minimize the smell?  Does smell tend to rise or fall?  Does it depend on the temperature?  Does first or second story not really matter?  We will probably have 2 uncovered litter boxes on one floor and 1 covered Litter Robot (which the cats use about half the time) on the other floor.  I am not concerned about the covered litter robot (which has minimal smell); I am just concerned with the smell of the large uncovered litter boxes. 
703,Minimum age of kittens for rabies vaccination,"I have a litter of Siberian kittens, and I'm thinking of taking them to a cat show in a couple months, but they'll be at the exact age when they are supposed to get vaccinated at the time. Polyvalent vaccine should be fine -- if I vaccinate them at 9 weeks and re-vaccinate 3 weeks later, they'll have exactly 3 weeks till the show. But then there's the rabies vaccine. All of the kinds I can find locally state that it should be administered to at least 3 months old kittens. If I vaccinate them 3 weeks before the show, they'll be 12 weeks old, which is about 10 days younger than 3 months. Are those 10 days that important? What will happen if I vaccinate the kittens before they're ready? And is there a way to determine if they're ready to be vaccinated other than their age? "
704,Possible reasons goldfish hanging out near surface,"We have two goldfish in an 18L tank, which has a pump filter and a light.  We feed them lightly once a day and I change the water every week or so.  We have had them for a few months and they have apparently been doing well overall.  (We have plans for a bigger tank, but we wanted to see how it went before investing a lot.)  They have always seemed to prefer hanging out at the bottom of the tank, but recently it seemed that they were both floating at the surface and had to work to move lower down.  The water tested okay (KH, GH, pH, Cl2, NO2, NO3).  I read here that this could be the result of some swim bladder disorder which may be caused by constipation.  We followed the instructions there to fast them for 3 days and then feed them mashed pea.  They still are hanging out a lot near the top, and sleep there at night.  They don't look as much now like they are floating and don't seem to have difficulty moving around the rest of the tank.  After feeding time they do forage along the bottom and all over the tank for quite some time.  I noticed they also gulp a lot at the surface after feeding time, even though the food we feed them doesn't float.  They always belch air bubbles after doing that, but I wonder if some of the air gets trapped inside.  So back to the fish' new hangout.  How likely is it this is a sign of infection?  Continued constipation?  Air in digestive tract?  Also, could the recent drop in temperature account for the change in behavior? "
705,Could letting a cat take a very short spin in the clothes dryer be a good way to prevent later incident?,"Would it be ethically wrong to purposely scare a cat from sneaking into the clothes dryer by turning the dryer on for a half spin when it decides to jump in?   It doesnt seem like it could hurt the cat if I only let it make a half spin or so. Also as long as I allow it to jump in of its own curiosity, the cat's fear wouldn't be pointed at me, but just the idea that jumping in the dryer can lead to a very scary result.   I'm just wondering if animal lovers world wide would curse me if I did this. Would it be considered a good or bad way to teach the cat not to get in the dryer?   I could be careful and check the dryer, keep the door closed, etc, but it seems over the years there's a possibility that the cat could sneak in and it be turned on without anyone knowing the cat is inside. I always worry about this when turning on my dryer.   You could say a cat wont jump in there with wet clothes, but sometimes you turn on the dryer if they've been sitting there a while to remove wrinkles, or you could have a front-opening washing machine, in which case the cat could jump in there too.  "
706,Why my cat is doing acts of sabotage?,"I have a male angora cat    The problem is that it keeps doing acts of sabotage, playing with litter, dropping vases, cracking cups, etc...    We also have 3 other cats in the house (his ""wife"" and their 2 ""children""). He keeps hurting them. why he is doing this ? Is it normal ? What is the best thing to do with him ? "
707,Chihuahua cries near door while trying to sleep,"My mom has a female chihuahua, about 4 to 5 years old.  While everyone is sleeping (at night, of course), she will cry (whine) outside of either my mom's door or my brother's door.  They both do not like it, yet have no clue how to go about making it stop.  Is there a way we can make this stop? Is there a quiet activity that can keep her distacted long enough to allow a full night without whining?  Edit: Letting the dog in the room is not an option. My family has work in the morning, and as much as we would love to let her in, the playful behavior is not suitable for sleep.   She does not give in. Even when it comes to hearing leaves move outside, she barks for hours upon hours.   She does not react well to being put in a room alone. She will continue to cry until she is let out.  She has never been crate trained. She has never been trained in any way. She is spoiled rotten. She can poo on my mom's couch and still get a treat.  My family's reaction to this behavior is yellong ""STOP"". They have no clue how to go about it. I'm the only one who seems to care enough to try and figure out the right way to handle this situation /: "
708,What factors are most important to adopters of rescue dogs?,"I manage a website for the Oldies Club, which is a UK based dog rescue charity specialising in older dogs, which also advertises senior dogs for other charities around the UK, and I also offer volunteer help with the websites of several other charities.  It can be difficult to decide which information about a dog should be provided most prominently on the website.  I'm aware of research suggesting  that a good quality photo is vital, but what other details are most likely to result in a dog receiving enquiries and home offers and should be prioritised?   Are there other factors that influence adopters when choosing a rescue to adopt from?  "
709,Why does my dog only show aggressive behavior indoors?,"My dog Cooper is a 1 1/2 yr old Lab mix, and for the last few months, his aggression has been constant. It's odd because he is totally normal away from home. Inside he growls and bares his teeth at my 5 yr old little sister whenever she comes too close to him or pets him. He guards my bed at all times, random areas in the house, trash, and (especially) his food bowl. We've resorted to muzzling him at all times because he has already attacked our other dogs twice and snaps at people other than myself for different things. (He's tried to bite my cousin over the socks/shoes in the bottom of my nightstand!)  Other than his resource guarding and apparent dominance issues, he's a really great dog. He goes to a dog park once a week and does amazing with the people and dogs there, so whatever is wrong has to do with our house. I won't have the funds to pay for a trainer for at least a few more months, and I have no intention of giving him away.  Has anyone had a similar experience? If so, do you have any tips/advice? "
710,Why does my cat not eat the hearts of its prey?,"My cat catches a lot of mice and birds.  It always leaves the heart, perfectly intact. My question is, what about the tails of the mice, the feathers of the birds? I sometimes find some feathers but never all of them. Does the cat eat it, and why does it leave the heart? "
711,Why does my Boston Terrier snort heavily at times?,"On occasion, my Boston Terrier will snort very heavily, usually only for about 20 seconds.  Its very loud, and it sounds kind of like there is a lot of snot in his nose when he does it.    Someone once told me that ""smushed face"" dogs such as a Boston Terrier or French Bulldog do this.  But why?  I'm not concerned that its affecting his breathing or anything (he's done it for years I'm told), but why do these kind of dogs do this? "
712,Is it possible for a human to get a disease from a feral cat?,"I posted a question about a cat in our house yard. Every morning at 7am, I feed her. Is it possible for a human to get a disease from a cat? I wash my hands everytime after petting her.   Also, Is it risky for me to give her a bath? Now she don't mind closing the door and setting inside my house. By the way, she is very funny, here is a video of her playing :D "
713,How long should I keep a well-adjusted cat in?,"I grew up with family cats and come from a family of cat lovers so have been around cats for a long time. However, recently my grandmother died and I offered to adopt her 10 year old tomcat, Ned.   My cousin also offered to adopt the cat, and as adopting him would have required me to ask permission from my landlady and possibly pay extra rent, I let her take him. However a week later, she asked if I could have him instead as she found she was severely allergic. I said yes, after getting permission from our landlady.  I know you're supposed to keep cats in for two weeks, but I really can't overstate how well he has adapted to living with us in such a short amount of time. From his first few hours with us on Sunday evening, he was curiously exploring the house, getting his belly rubbed, getting comfortable. We woke up to find he'd used the litter tray with no problems and is eating healthily. He's slept on our bed with us and sits on our laps most evenings while we watch TV. He's a fussy, affectionate old thing and he often follows you round the house while you're doing chores.  During his brief tenure at my cousin's house, she said he was 'hiding' from her 6 year old son a lot, and it sounds like he was a lot more timid there than he is here, which is a good sign for us I suppose.  Like most cats he loves looking out of the window, and sometimes he cries to go out of the house by the back door, but whenever we slip out of the back door to go outside, he doesn't make a break for it. He clearly wants to explore our small, fairly enclosed back garden but doesn't seem like he wants to escape!  How much leeway is there with this 2 week incubation date? Does anyone have any stories of letting a cat out earlier - accidentally or not - and is there anything I should know if I decide to let him out early? Or despite all the good signs is this a straight up bad idea? "
714,My cat refuses to eat any wet food,"After reading up on a lot of forums about how cats need wet food I have tried to feed my cat wet food from about November until recently (February). I dont try every day, more like every  once in a while when i go to the store i try a different brand and have even tried one or two off amazon. I've tried just a small dollop in his normal food, ive tried just wet food without his food, and ive tried a mixture of both evenly and nothing worked. He hasnt touched wet food any time that ive tried this. When i mix he will leave the whole thing, when i put dried food on top he will eat it off and around the wet food but not touch the wet food at all.  I should mention i have a scheduled feeding time and amount and i have only tried an evening time for the wet food. I keep him on poultry for the most part but on the wet food ive tried even branching to Salmon as a 4th ingredient. His dry food is chicken and turkey based and he eats fine.   He drinks a decent amount of water when i am home, sometimes ill hear him drinking randomly in the evening and every morning after i shower he jumps in right after i get out and licks the floor of the shower for a little bit. I could shower right after he drinks from his bowl and this will still happen so its not like he is dying of dehydration (from what i can tell). His coat is really nice and im taking him on a checkup soon.  I am wondering if this is a problem? Should i keep trying different wet foods or should i give up? Is there a specific process to transition? Is there a specific temp or way to serve the food that makes a difference? "
715,Microchips: which national database hosts the record if the pet moved between countries?,"Our dog has an ISO standard microchip implanted in Hungary according to this page:      This transponder has a country code according to ISO 3166 from   Hungary, the manufacturer is ""Felixcan S.L."" and the product is   granted as injectable. The transponder is ISO conform.   In 2013 she had a rabies vaccination in Hungary, and this is visible in the hungarian database. After we moved with her to the UK. This year we are travelling again so she got a vaccination in the UK on the 1st of February. We got the stamp in her passport, and have been told that the microchip has been updated. Now I am trying to check the public online databases and I don't see the recent update. From here I found out that every country has its own database(s). UK has the Petlog, that one knows nothing about our microchip. This very nice page queries almost all local databases, and it finds nothing, although tells the UK database has some communication issues.  At the UK clinic we had the rabies vaccination I could only talk to the receptionist so far, and she could not help. I am worried and want to be sure that we can cross the border with no problem. What is the best way to find this out? Also this brings up a more generic question: how this whole system works? If the Vet inputs data, where it will be recorded, how these databases exchange data between each other, how the international database Europetnet collects the data, and how often? And how the border authorities check the database?  "
716,Identifying maine coon vs. ragdoll vs. ragamuffin,"The typical differences given between maine coon, ragdoll, and ragamuffin cats are somewhat vague, and also sometimes involve knowing the cat well enough to be familiar with its disposition. According to [website]Maine coon: Gentle, independent, intelligent. Lap cat. Good with everybody. Ragdoll: Friendly, gentle, quiet. Lap cat. Good with everybody. Ragamuffin: Affectionate, friendly, gentle. Lap cat. Good with everybody.   Physically there's a bunch of fuzzy stuff, like life-span, heart defect risks (HCM in maine coons and ragdolls), etc. All three breeds allow for a wide variety of colorings. Most confusingly, maine coons seem to have a reputation for being a rather large breed, but petbreeds.com actually lists the typical max weights of ragdolls and ragamuffins as higher (20lb vs 15lb maine coon). So, also, not enough to go on.  Same deal with photographs. A lot of sites have a picture of a ""typical"" cat of a certain breed but appearances vary greatly. Even just looking at image search results for maine coon, ragdoll, and ragamuffin, there is significant overlap, especially as you scroll further down the result list, or if you add a coloring (for example, add ""tuxedo"" to each of those searches).  And of course, all of the above has a lot of variance. It becomes especially difficult when the cat is not purebred.  I find the commonly listed physical and personality differences to be non-specific and unsatisfactory, so:  The Question:  Is there any typical physical differences that can be used to quickly get at least a decent guess of which of these three breeds an adult cat is?  In particular: facial features and proportions, eye colors, jaw/teeth, head/ear shape, skeletal structure, tail, legs and paws? (For example, this ragdoll-specific food mentions ""the Ragdoll cat's broad jaw"", a trait generally not mentioned in forums or breed comparison sites.) I am specifically looking for some info beyond the standard ""my ragdoll is the sweetest little guy"". Journals and academic sources welcome but certainly not required.  I am more interested in identifying adult/senior cats than kittens, although I certainly wouldn't turn away any kitten identification info. "
717,Old cat flea allergy dermatitis.,"When I scratch around my cats spine, he immediatly starts licking the air.As my vet said, this is obvious sign of a flea allergy. Advantix multi was the solution, as two days later, and for the entire time he was on the medication, he did not react this way.   As cats do, he got older and the same treatment does not have the same effect. He seems to still be affected by the dermatitis at his older age. Is this common?  He is on a high dose and can't go higher. Is there anything I can do to make him more comfortable? "
718,"Older, larger cat introduced after tragedy...Not going well. HELP!","I have a four year old brother/sister. Izze &amp; Bella. Ive had since kittens. Lovely, sweet indoor cats, they play, wrestle, small 8 lb cats. Izze was the perfect male cat, he was in love with me, fetched, a just a joy. Bella sits and observes mostly, a cuddly cat but gets crabby at times toward her brother, but both, wonderful cats.   Last July my boyfriend was murdered in his home.He had 2 dogs and 3 cats. Long story, but the dogs were locked in a room till they died and the 3 cats fended for themselves for a month till rescued. Lots of violence was going on during that time, not to the cats, we dont think. Traumatic tegardless. All 3 cats were adopted together as kittens and are 12 years old. Lived all their lives in that home with the dogs. All indoor cats. In July 2016, two cats were adopted together by a friend. The 3rd cat, I took home.  Patches is the new cat in the home. She is 12 lbs. She's a bit jumpy, hears every noise and is rather vocal. Mine, not so much. She's a lover but more dog-like, she pushes hard when being pet, even aggressively so with little nips to make you continue and likes to climb on my chest or lay on top of me when on my side. She eats like a dog. My two are slow, she gobbles and stalks their bowls waiting for leftovers. Mine used to take hours for wet food. No rush, no stress.  All 3 are fine together when begging for food. I can pet 2 at a time, if I'm there between them. Sometimes all 3 will sleep on a bed, but not near each other. There are 3 perchesin the house.  So now, since Patches, Izze, my male, 8 pounder gets in.a stalking mood and looks at Patches in an evil way. He chases, she runs, turns, hisses, screams and if they start hitting (all front claw declawed), Bella leaps in to defend her brother and she's a brute! Patches and Bella alone are cordial, but growl at each other sometime. They never go after each other.  My cats never peed on carpets or floors before. Now Izze, my perfect cat is peeing somewhere almost daily. I have 4 litter boxes, 2 up and 2 down.  It's been 6 months. I do not know how to get Izze to stalking and harassing Patches. I've used water, loud noises. It stops them in the moment but sometimes I'm not quick enough. The peeing is destroying my home.   I was in tears tonight, will this ever end?. I think it's all territorial, dominance but not sure what to do now. I live in a 2 bedroom townhouse, 1700 Sq ft. As I said, they are all indoor cats.   Do I let them fight it out? Do I lock Izze away when he starts stalking? Do I keep spraying them?   Any ideas? Patches has been thru so much and so have I. I can't get rid of her, but we are all so stressed.  Thank you. "
719,Ultrasonic Bark Control,"We have a dog who is quite a barker – any activity outside of our yard is cause for a loud and often sustained volley of barking. It is driving one of our neighbors crazy, so we've been experimenting with various bark control devices. We've got a dog door and the biggest problem is when our dog is out and we're not at home.  So far we've tried:   Locking the dog door, effective, but the dog loves to sit out in the yard and watch the world go by. Also, it seems mean to ask him to ""hold it"" for most of the day when one of us can't get home to let him out in the middle of the day. I think it might also make him more excitable and vocal when he is out. Sitting with him in the yard and giving him lots of treats when people and dogs go by. It might help, it has definitely improved his recall, but it doesn't seem to be making a significant shift in barking. A citronella spray collar - not sure if it works at all. He might either like the smell or he might be ignoring it. He comes in from barking smelling like a lemon… Ultrasonic bird houses that are supposed to create an unpleasant sound when the dog barks, which is in turn supposed to reduce barking. More than anything we've tried, these seem to be having some effect.   So, my question(s):   What is the best placement for these devices? They have a speaker on one side. I assume that they are highly directional. Is there anyway to estimate or measure the ""dispersion angle"" (is that the right term) of the speaker so that I can visualize the area that is covered? How sensitive are ultrasonic signals to interference by foliage? Any other suggestions for effective placement?  "
720,How do I treat a sideways laying betta fish?,"I have a betta fish I have had for 2 years. A few months ago, my nephew got into its food (which I know keep up high) and dumped it into his tank. I cleaned the tank but not before he ate whatever he could eat. I left him unfeed for a few days hoping to let him finish eating the food that was in his system and for him to bounce back. That did not work so I tried a dose of diaphnia. Once again the fish continued to lay on its side. He is still like that. Was his swim bladder broken? Is there something I can do for him to help bounce him back? He still comes up to eat. He's currently in a 5 gallon tank with silk planks, a cave, a water filter, stone gravel and a heater.  "
721,How to keep my cats warm in outside cat house?,"I really need to figure out a way to have my cats live outdoors (6 months old). They're stinking up the whole house. I'm going to buy a cat house on Amazon, but I'm not sure how to keep it warm. I feel bad for those guys being in cold temperatures when they're used to being mostly indoors. Should I try to make it warm and toasty for them? Or is it ok to just give them like a heated pad to lay on? "
722,What is the purpose of wet cat food?,"What's the purpose/value of a wet food diet for cats? Why would you want to do that?  Due to some recent health issues I've been highly focused on my cats diet, and regularly logging caloric/potassium/B12 intake as well as mass eaten per meal. One thing I noticed is that wet food has an extremely low calorie:mass ratio compared to dry food.   It seems nearly impossible to meet a cat's caloric intake requirements on wet food alone. For example, a 5.3 oz can of a certain brand of wet food contains only 62 kcal, meaning that a cat would have to eat a whopping 18-20 or so ounces of this stuff to get their daily intake in the 200 kcal area.   The four wet foods I have info on here range from 0.735 to 1.245 kcal/g, meaning 160-272g of food that must be consumed per day. That's on or past the upper limit of what I see healthy cats fit in their stomachs in one day (my 3 year old tops out around 200g if she absolutely stuffs herself but typically eats 180g-190g, my older cat maxes out about 180g but typically eats 150g-160g). By comparison the dry food I have on hand is 4.103 kcal/g, meaning only 48g or so must be eaten.  Under the assumption that the nutritional content of wet vs dry food is similar and sufficient, I can't imagine a normal cat being able to eat enough wet food to get even close to their daily caloric intake. Both of my cats only get a disturbingly low 130-180 kcal/day when on wet food only.  So why does wet food exist? For what purpose would you feed your cat wet food? I used to view it as a reasonable alternative to dry food but since I began calorie counting and monitoring diets I can't see a reason to ever feed it to a cat.  The only value I can sort of see in it is if you want to do a wet/dry mix to maintain a healthy caloric intake but also add some mass to the food so the cats aren't walking around on empty stomachs, but I'm not sure if there's any real reason to do that. The other thing is, I wonder if I'm just selecting particularly low calorie wet foods (there seems to be a trend of lower-end cat foods containing higher calorie counts).  The brands I've examined are Royal Canin, Hill's, Wellness, Iams ProHealth, and various small but respectable brands. Currently I've settled on Royal Canin for both wet and dry.   (I don't buy the ""wet foods help cats get water"" line of reasoning so much. While they'll certainly get water from wet food, in my limited personal experience, in a sample of about 20 or so cats,  I've never actually seen a normal, healthy cat severely dehydrate itself when water is available by not drinking it, and a pet fountain or better placement of a water bowl almost always solves issues there. When a cat isn't drinking water it's seems to virtually always be a sign of an actual bigger health issue. But, in any case, I'm interested in other value besides just water content, and I can't justify watery food with critically low caloric intake.) "
723,Are automatic cat laser toys safe?,"I'm looking for some automatic cat toy for proper entertainment. I bumped into automatic laser toys and I'm a but surprised they exist since you're not supposed to hit the cat's eyes with the laser. If it's automatic this might very easily happen. Are the lasers of these toys way below 5 mW? And even then, is it safe enough if the laser somehow points directly at a cat's eyes?  I don't find much relevant information on Google and I don't want to rely on the information provided by the producers of such toys.  This question is very related: What level of output laser pointer is safe for a cat? "
724,What is the difference between a hair coat and a fur coat in dogs?,"Listening to dog breeders talk about dogs, I sometimes hear them mentioning that a breed has a ""hair coat"" or a ""fur coat"".  What are the differences between the two types of coat? Do they have different bathing or grooming requirements? How can I tell if my dog has hair or fur?  "
725,Food Pellet - Is my rabbit eating enough?,"I've recently gotten a bunny, less than a week, and I researched a lot before getting it. I bought a large cage, timothy hay, Zupreme rabbit food... As soon as I brought him from the shelter, I filled his water bottle, his food bowl, and the hay disposal. On the first day he was really scared, so he spent most of the day on his hiding spot. But on the second day, I noticed he ate quite a bit of hay and drank the water. However, I feel like he isn't eating much of the pellet. As soon as I put cabbage or carrots, he eats them straight away, but I feel like he is barely touching his food. How much are they supposed to eat? Am I over reacting? He is 5 months old and 3.7 pounds "
726,Do mosquitoes bite reptiles? Is there any danger of communicating pathogens?,"I'd like to know the generic answer for reptiles, but I'm particularly concerned about tortoises.  Mine is largely an indoor tortoise, and the mosquitoes are already pretty much gone from our area, but I was curious about it.  The occasional bug does get into the house, and since I can't always pick up waste right away, they do find their way to the tortoise's enclosure.  Do mosquitoes actually bite reptiles?  I know that their skin is much tougher than a human's, and I would suspect that they wouldn't have the same immunological response to the bite that we would, but I don't know for sure.    If they do bite reptiles, is there any danger of communicating something like West Nile or EEE (Eastern equine encephalitis)?  I know these diseases can affect mammalian pets but I don't have any further information on reptiles.  "
727,"What ""due dilligence"" measures should I follow when adopting / buying a dog?","My wife and I are about to be first time pet owners, and I am wondering, what should I do as ""due dilligence""?  So far, I can think of the following items, but I am sure I am probably missing some things:   Make sure their shots are up to date Make sure they are spayed / neutered Ask if they are house broken (e.g. don't go bathroom in the house, and won't tear up furniture, don't bark excessively at night, etc...) Ask about their health (should we even have them checked out by a vet?) Look for the health danger signs as described in: What danger signs indicate health issues when aquiring a new dog? Put them on a pet health care plan Ask about what food they are on, and get this food (e.g. don't switch food) Is there anything else we should consider?  "
728,How costly are dental procedures on dogs?,"We are planning to adopt a couple of older dogs, and are concerned that they may have dental problems.  I am wondering, what types of dental procedures are generally done on dogs, and are they generally very costly (e.g. like they are for humans)?  I don't have thousands of dollars to shell out for dental procedures if that is what it will take. Does anyone know how much dental procedures typically run for dogs? "
729,How to get the dog to be confident enough to play?,"I have a 1.5 year old pointer, which will not play with toys. My intention is to go hunting with him, and therefore he needs to learn how to fetch.   I have tried back chain teaching, which were very unsuccessful. I have tried positive feedback training, but it is hard to give him any positive feedback, because he let go of everything as soon as he hears anything that just sounds like a command.  I am afraid of using force fetch, due to his tender/fragile temperament.   My biggest problem with this, is that it is not disciple that he lacks. He is extremely well in ""dressur"" and enjoys to be trained in all discipline style training. (Sit, stay, heel and etc.)   The reason for this problem might be the two smaller dogs living in the house. It seems that he does not think he ""owns"" anything, and will drown whatever he has, as soon as he he makes contact with person or other dogs. He never plays with them, maybe also because the other dogs is sometimes rough on him. (Must be added that the big dog is trained separately from the other dogs)  How can I get him to play with toys, not barking at the toys, or run over to it, but take it up, and at least run away with it?   How do I get him to gain confidence when he lives with the other dogs? "
730,How smart are rabbits?,"Recently in chat Matt s. posted a link to this short gif  [website]Descritpion     A black and white dutch rabbit goes up to a hurdle with 4 bars, removes the second cross bar up with her mouth and walks through the hurdle, carrying the cross bar.  She does not knock any of the other cross bars off.  She carries the cross bar to the end of the runway and places it to the side, next to another spare bar laying on the floor.    The problem solving concepts implied here are huge.   I don't want to jump over the hurdle, but I have to go straight ahead (there is a person behind the bunny) can I move one of those bars? Ok now I have a bar in my mouth, can I get through here without getting bonked on the head by the rest? I know the person is going to make me run down this runway, again, where can I put this so it is out of the way?   So how much of this is happenstance and how much is reasoning? How smart are rabbits?  "
731,Can guinea pigs live separately but see each other often and still be happy?,"My girlfriend and I currently do not live together, but we will in the near future, and we are considering getting guinea pigs. Seeing as guinea pigs are social creatures we decided we would want to get two in order to support healthy and happy piggies.   We don't want to shuffle their cage from house to house during the week so we decided that we would possibly want to hold them separately at our homes and bring them together whenever we see each other. Which is just about every day. When we move in together in the next 2 years they will be joined together in one cage. Both will be same gender and have already been together for some time.   Would this work? Would they remember each other and get along as two females? I am worried that if they do not constantly live, eat and sleep together in the same cage they will forget about on another and need to constantly reintroduced.  Is this a valid concern? "
732,Why is one puppy of the litter left behind by its mother?,Why does a female dog neglect one of the litter?   She moved all the others and left one. I took it to her and she will not have anything to do with it. It seems healthy.   Is there a way to get her to re-accept it? 
733,Are cats able to find their way back home if lost?,"I have a cat which was at my place since its birth and we looked after him.   Recently a neighbour had problems with him, so we had to leave him at a fish market around 2 kms from our home. But now I'm missing him and want him back, so I went to the fish market to search for him but couldn't find him.   Is the any chance that he will come back on his own? We had left him before, but to a place very close to our home, and he came back in 4 days. Are there any chances that the same thing will happen again? I just want him back. Do cats come back on their own? "
734,How can I curb my dog's tendencies to roll in everything?,"As a continuation to this question, Why does my dog roll in gross stuff?, I was wondering if there was a way to actually stop my dog from rolling in everything and anything.  My dog is about 9 months old, a golden retriever/lab mix.  He rolls in anything, all the time - rotten, dead animals, poop, and onto some animals when they are still alive - the other day he rolled onto a snake and got its musk all over him.  Is there a way to curb his rolling tendencies?  It is difficult to stop him since we live in a large forested area and take him for frequent walks down forest trails - plenty of opportunity to roll in whatever is around at the time.   "
735,What kind of danger does cat litter pose to my pregnant wife?,"My wife is pregnant and has a dog/cat kennel. Is it really true that pregnant women should not be around cat litter because it's harmful for the baby?  If it is true, how close can she be around it? Is it safe to be in the same building since the scent could get in the air condition vents? "
736,How do I stop my Indoor dog from riffling through and knocking over the trashcan?,"After some months working with my dog I've managed to more or less get my 8-year-old beagle to behave enough to live indoors with near full access to all areas of the house. This is something that seems to make him very happy, as we don't have a yard and he used to be kept on the small balcony.   He's even better behaved on walks now. I still haven't managed to break him of his obsession with garbage, however. My understanding of training methods is extremely limited, as I've only been studying about pet ownership and training since becoming his co-owner less than a year ago. I've been trying my best at applying principles of positive reinforcement, which is how I've gotten him to behave well within certain contexts, but I'm really very unfamiliar with animals in general as of yet and have very little clue what sorts of incentives to offer - or more accurately, I don't know how to connect refraining from bad behavior with rewards.   So far I've experimented with ""NO"" which only works temporarily. I've tried lightly slapping him whenever he shoves his head into the garbage at home, then when that didn't work I tried chasing him out to the balcony and giving him 30 minute time outs. I've gotten him to behave when he knows I'm watching. But when my back is turned, he's sometimes getting into the garbage or the cereal box or something else.  I've carried out the training presented in the ""It's Yer Choice"" video, and that worked wonderfully - when I'm watching him. When I'm out of sight, the training seems to break down. It doesn't happen every time I'm not watching him, but it happens often enough to be a bit of a headache.  Should I just wait for him to get used to living indoors? Am I doing anything that's reinforcing the garbage obsession? Is there a better way for me to get him to behave when I'm not watching as much as when I am watching? "
737,Can rabbit and cat live together?,"I have a free-roaming (no cage, potty-trained) ~5y old pet rabbit. I would love to adopt a cat from the shelter, but I'm worried about them getting along.  My rabbit is very calm and happy bun, he mostly is just lazying around nearby and is very friendly towards people (licks hands, gets in a lap, etc).  My rabbit did not accept a female bunny friend - she was too bossy, and it upset him greatly. However, he gets fine with parents' cats and dogs, when we visit. He lets dogs lick him and prefers to lie nearby. He is scared of oldest cat, but has mutual interest towards the other one. They lie together in bed and my bunny takes initiative - comes to the cat first, sniffs him, etc. Cat is generally just ignoring him. They are always supervised.  I live in a studio apartment and work from home, but I would still be scared to leave them unsupervised at night / when not home. I could lock bunny up in his old hutch, when I'm away (it's forever open, he hangs out in it), but I feel it would be injustice against him, even though he sleeps there most of the time.  My idea would be to call shelter and look for an adult, calm cat, that is not displaying an agression/without hunting experience. I would ask to foster a cat for a few weeks and see how it goes. But I am still not sure it could work out.  I am afraid my bunny can get hurt at some point, without warning.  Is it a bad idea to keep cat and rabbit together? Maybe somebody has experience with this?  Thank you in advance! "
738,Concerned About Skin Tags,"I have noticed the second ""skin tag"" on my (adult) dog. I pet, stroke, and massage my dog regularly and these seem to pop up suddenly - out of no-where. They resemble rice and appear to be fatty skin. They seem harmless enough and are not in an area that bothers her. Still... it concerns me.  Has anyone had similar issues or inquired about it with a Veterinarian?  Update: the rice shaped skin tag has fallen off. (What's up with that???) "

742,Large DIY Dissassemblable Cat Cage?,"In order to bring a cat to university as an emotional support animal, the school is requiring me to keep the cat in a cage while I'm not in the room. I don't think this is fair to the cat, but since I have no choice, I'm wondering:  How is the best way to make a large cat cage that I can take apart and put back together if need be? Would it make sense to get a couple of cat cages (read: the black metal wire ones) and put them together with some duct tape? "
743,Highly aggressive kittens,"Situation:   Two kittens (originally three in litter, one died recently) are extremely aggressive around food and in pursuit of food. Their behavior includes slashing, biting, growling, and hissing at anything that gets within approximately 4 feet of them while they are eating. They aggressively try to steal food directly from people's hands while they are trying to eat it. One of them recently slashed the other's eye to the point where fluid started oozing out after it tried eating with it. We have a lot of cats (15+) living around our farmhouse (rural midwest USA). Many have also displayed aggression towards other cats when feeding, swatting and hissing occasionally. During the times we let the kittens in the house and they are so frantic, there is still food in the bowls we put outside, and they are clearly willing to eat that kind of food inside (it's the same food they're so defensive about). I know that at least one of the kittens has eaten from those bowls before. I do not know how much they have been eating from it recently. The kittens are both at least a month old, likely older. They are roughly the size that they can be comfortably held within two hands. I believe they have stopped nursing recently. It is not practical for us to feed all of the cats separately.   Question(s):   Is it possible / likely that this behavior is the product of a couple generations of inbreeding? Or is it more likely that this behavior is due to them being denied access to food by the other cats when we aren't looking? If the underlying cause of the behavior is not a lack of food, is there a way for it to be corrected? I have friends and family that are interested in taking care of these two kittens. If the behavior persists as they grow up they will become a genuine threat to safety. If the underlying cause of the behavior is a lack of food (due to it being denied), is there a practical way to resolve it with rather limited manpower?  "

746,Why does my cat like licking my armpits?,"I like lying in my bed with my arms up, but my cat sometimes comes to lick my armpits. His sandpaper tongue doesn't feel that nice. I'm using a stick antiperspirant, but he usually does this in the evening after the antiperspirant is long absorbed.  What is so tasty about my stinky, sweaty armpits? Is it healthy for my cat? "
747,Why should there be one more litter box than the total number of cats?,"I've seen it recommended in many places that you should own a litter box for each cat in your home plus an extra. What are the reasons behind this, and is there an upper limit where this strategy stops helping?  Example from The Humane Society of the United States:     How many?      The general rule of thumb is one box for each cat plus one more. Then none of them will ever be prevented from eliminating in the litter box because it's already occupied.  "
748,How can stop my adult cat from urinating in inappropriate places?,"My 8 year old cat has recently began urinating in inappropriate places. How can I correct this behavior?  At first he started urinating on the floor, in a small area in the basement. I moved a litter box to the area, thinking maybe he felt safer in this area and preferred this place (I have two dogs that go down into the basement from time to time, but are typically restricted from going down there).  Since then, he's started urinating all over in the basement. In the 8 years I've had him, he's never not used the litter box.  He doesn't seem to have any other symptoms of dementia, so I'm reluctant to suspect that.    Is there a way to correct this behavior? "
749,What treats are safe for my ferrets to eat?,"I've read that ferrets can have small quantities of fruit, veggies, yogurt treats, and similar things you'd find labeled as ""For ferrets"". Are these actually safe for my ferret? Aren't they carnivores?  "
750,Can dogs be infected by the brain-eating amoeba?,"In October 2013, Naegleria fowleri (a.k.a. ""the brain-eating amoeba""), was  confirmed to be found in the Louisiana public drinking water systems.  I live in the southern US and am concerned, as I have dogs in areas where there are low waterways, and I provide them tap water to drink.  I found ""Could your dog be at risk for brain-eating amoeba?"" on PetMD, but the authoring doctor notes that while Deadly Microbes claims dogs are not at risk (just mice and humans), his research on the Veterinary Information Network revealed one potential case of an infected dog from 1997, (Steele, K.E. et.al. Amoebiasis in a dog with gastric ulcers and adenocarcinoma. J. of Vet. Diagnostic Investigation 9(1): 91-93. 1997.) (case). He was unable to confirm his findings as the the source document was unable to be located at the time of the article.  The article has been located and the doctor has been alerted to its existence via Twitter.  I would assume the precautions I can take are to use distilled water to feed my dogs and prevent them from swimming or drinking from waterways or standing water.  So, the question remains: can dogs be infected by this horrible amoeba?  Can I feel safe letting my dogs swim in the pond? "
751,How can I help a dog to lose weight?,"My uncle's dog is obese (too fat) and my uncle wants him to lose weight.  As the dog is currently staying with me, I was thinking of reducing his food intake and not giving him food as regularly as before, but I think doing this will affect his health as he is used to his regular food.  How can I make sure reducing his food intake won't negatively affect the dog's health? Is there a trusted way I can help him lose weight without reducing food intake?  The dog's current foods are mainly beef and sometimes a little rice and vegetables. He also enjoys canned food and snacks, which he eats a lot of.  The dog is always taken for a walk every morning for about 10 minutes. "
752,Which South American fish will keep pygmy chain sword plants clean?,"I have a new tank (40 gallon long) that's just finished cycling. I've had plants in there for a few weeks already and they're doing well overall, but are starting to show some real algae build-up. In particular my pygmy chain sword plants (Echinodorus tenellus) have quite a lot of brown diatoms and green hair algae.  Since I can finally start stocking the tank with fish, I was thinking I might start with an algae-eater that might clean up the plants. It's a South American community tank, so my three options that I know of are:   A small pack of Otocinclus A bristlenose, bulldog, or other smallish herbivorous pleco. (Definitely not a common pleco.) A Farlowella, or one of the other whiptails   The tankmates will be 3-4 Apistogramma, a group of Corydoras, and two schools of some apisto-friendly tetras, TBD.  I should note that I'm looking at these fish mainly because I think they're all interesting. I'll be choosing their primary diet appropriately, and any algae-eating is a bonus. On that basis I'd prefer a pleco or whiptail, but I don't have personal experience with either, and I'm thinking they'll be too large to pay much attention to the dainty little leaves on the pygmy chain swords. How efficient would they be at keeping them clean? Would either of them significantly damage the plants in the process?    Follow-up: Once I was actually looking at the fish in person, I ended up really, really liking the clown plecos, which don't eat much algae. (And importantly, the girlfriend likes them too.) I decided that this outweighed the utility factor, and got a pair of them. My algae right now is not a big problem, but if it were I'd have definitely gone with a pack of Otocinclus. "
753,"URGENT: Foreign object removed, intestines patched, gut still shows fluid buildup. Going into surgery #3","My friend's dog is about to have a critical surgery, and the vet hasn't seen this particular problem before. I'm hoping one of you can offer additional insight.  The stats... Species: Border Collie Age: 7 Sex/Neuter status: Nuetered Breed: Pure Body weight: 50lbs History: Rock-solid. No health issues.  The symptoms:   Wouldn't eat much/at all for a week. Ultrasound showed foreign object in gut Surgery #1 found and removed a toy squeaker, which had moved a little and done enough damage to a section of intestine that about 1 foot of intestine had to be removed. Further fluid buildup shown. Surgery #2 revealed that body had reacted to first sutures. Used a different type of (longer) sutures to re-patch intestines. 2 days later, fluid build up had increased from 50ml to 100ml (I think that's the exact figure...I am sure that it was supposed to go down by half and instead doubled). Temperature up. The decision point: New fluid buildup COULD be just an infection, or it could be an remaining/new leak in the gut. Can do barium to find out, but if it's a leak then there will be barium in the gut too. Can wait on it to 'heal' but it could also get worse. We decided to do a 3rd surgery to look for a leak, and attempt to patch it if found.  The dilemma: The vet says that he's only seen one other case where a foreign objected resulted in a gut that was still leaking after 2 surgeries. In that case, he did another patch but the dog died.   My question: It seems like we have bumped up against this particular vet's experience limit. HE has only dealt with one other case like this, and did not ever discover what went wrong (and what could have been done) in his last case. He admits that he's at a loss for explaining the current situation. My hope is that one of you will have seen it before and can offer some insight.  Any ideas for what could be going on, or how to treat it? Have you seen anything like this before?  Side note: You probably hear this a lot, but this dog means everything to his owner, who is about to get married this week. Our vet is out of ideas, but if you have any insight we would be deeply grateful. "
754,Getting a cat to take zonisamide,"I have a cat which has had a couple seizures, and the vet has prescribed 50 mg of zonisamide daily. It's proving quite difficult to administer the medication.  Initially we tried mixing a flavored suspension with a small amount of wet food. Normally she eats wet food with gusto, but with one lick she walked away.  We tried squirting the suspension in her mouth. She ran off and foamed at the mouth. I've tasted a small amount of this stuff and it's extremely bitter. Yuck.  I'm told pills aren't an attractive option since they are quite large.  The latest suggestion is a chewy treat. We've tried some unmedicated samples and she'll gladly eat them, but I suspect they won't taste quite so good with zonisamide in them. I'm hoping to avoid paying for medication that will ultimately be unpalatable.  Does anyone have some experience getting a cat to take this medication? How? Or, are there other anticonvulsants which are still effective in cats but taste less horrible? "
755,"Buying new rabbits, unsure if need neutering","so I'm going to be getting two new male rabbits (from young ages) and was wondering if it is best to neuter? I don't want them fighting and then having to separate them... Although u had a male uneutered and he was never aggressive to me or anyone, however did live alone. Don't really want two females because they're harder utopia neuter and if u don't they get phantom pregnancies and pyometra's, also never had a female before as well as often being less responsive than a male. Really would like to neuter them to avoid you issues it's just its not me who'll be paying for it, my dad would so he's got to understand why it's important... Any personal experiences and advice?  "
756,Why did our Djungarian hamster stop using her house?,"Our Djungarian hamster has had a big, wooden house (under the wheel) where she used to happily live since we got her a few months ago. But recently she stopped using it for sleeping. Instead she just burrows under her water bottle and sleeps there, using the house only as food storage.    What could be possible reasons for this behavior? Could it be the house doesn't satisfy her needs for some reason any more?  The house has multiple compartments, separated by tiny walls with holes so that she can crawl between them:    We tried to remove the walls, just in case, but she didn't care at all for this change. "
757,Is there a safe dose of vitamin D to give a cat?,"I know that too much vitamin D (fat soluble) can cause toxicity in cats, but how much is too much?   The reason I asked this is - When I open my vitamin D bottle, because I take it, my kitty goes ""can I get one of those"" - every time.  She's convinced that they must taste great.  My cat is crazy, I've caught her eating dust bunnies which I sometimes pull from her mouth, sometimes I'm not successful.  I've seen her eat feathers from my pillow, biting the plastic ends off things and swallowing the plastic.  I've tried to cat-proof my house but she's just one of those, if I can chew on it, I'll eat it types.     Fortunately she's gotten better. When she was a kitten she was just crazy.  She likes ear wax and more than once has pulled a used Q-tip out of the garbage and chewed on the used end.  I feed her well. Expensive canned food and some dry food.  She wants my vitamin D. On googling I find that, some cats can be vitamin D deficient, but dosing should be done properly.  My cat is 10 lb. Is once in a while (or maybe just once), vitamin D supplement, a safe dose? It might be that she just wants the gelatin, in which case, maybe I'll squeeze the vitamin D oil out of the pill and give her the gel capsule.     Note added 11 months later:   While not part of the question exactly, my little kitty, now nearly 2 years old and 11 lbs, she no longer begs when I open my (Dr. prescribed) vitamin D pill container.   I think it may have been a kitten thing, kittens having an urge to try stuff, but that's just a guess.  "
758,Goldfishes died first night,"We bought 3 small gold fishes from Walmart last night. We poured some tap water in the tank and waited for the Clorine to release (after 2 hours), we put them in with their water (initially in the plastic from Walmart). The night was very cold even in the hall. Say 60 degree. In the morning we saw all three almost dead, although look alive from above, they didn't move at all. Their mouth was slightly moving, but looked like they were dying. Finally all three fully dead.   What could have been the reason? We thought maybe the low temperature?   At this time of photo, the black one was probably dead.  "

760,What is the most effective least toxic thing to kill dog ticks?,"i wonder whether you smart people can help. I've semi adopted a cute fluffy dog in SE Asia and it's Man vs Dog tick, and the ticks are winning big time.  The problem is that the place is full of street dogs so the ticks are always there to be picked up. Used Raid in the apartment, which i guess works for the rooms but doesn't always kill the ticks unless you smother them with it. Will it kill the eggs and larvae?  Tried smothering him in lemongrass juice yesterday but some ticks just walked right through that.   Any ideas for him and the home?  Thanks "
761,Why my cat literally swallows whatever thread she gets?,"I have noticed this weird behavior behavior in my cat. She simply loves any thread, whether it is cotton thread, woollen thread or plastic thread. She starts chewing and swallowing the thread.  Today I found her chewing on a long thread of wool. I immediately scolded her and started pulling out the woolen thread from her mouth. To my astonishment I pulled out literally 3 meters of the woollen thread from her mouth. (Probably from her stomach. I had to pull the thread with force. But I did not at that time look inside her mouth.)  So why does she shows this weird behavior? Is this harmful? If harmful how to modify her behavior so that she no longer does this? "

765,Could my dog be a chimera (hybrid)?,"My pet Lola was born of an abandoned spitz-cross stray in Feb 2012.  She had a thick white coat with brown ears and face mask, and a big brown spot on  her rump where her tail is joined.  Big deep chest and body but thin short legs (like that of the Pomeranian).  Her tail is short and lifted up in sickle formation like a JRT cross.  She had a few tiny brown spots on her legs.  Since last couple of years (after she turned 4+) she has begun to develop small brown patches all over her white body?   Do dogs change their coats as they grow ?  Is there more to this ?   Could she be a chimera?   Her unmaternal mother tried to bury her in our compost pit soon after she was born.   Her body was shaped like a piglet and is still is big for her height.      Should I get her DNA tested?   Could being a chimera and not knowing it cause problems when treating for any infections ? "
766,"Is kitten-rabbit ""mating"" behavior something to worry about?","We've got a 3 year old neutered male dwarf rabbit and a male kitten who is almost four months old. The kitten isn't neutered yet, but will be before he turns five months old.   The cat and the rabbit are friendly. They don't groom each other (yet - I have hope!) but they run and play together, and boop noses together sometimes. But earlier today I caught the kitten mounting the rabbit, including biting him on the scruff of his neck. The rabbit did not seem panicked; he just held still, even after I separated them. He seemed relaxed, but didn't move for several minutes.    How did the rabbit interpret this behavior? He didn't seem to mind it, so I wonder if he felt he was being groomed, as is his due as king of the house.  Was this aggressive behavior on the part of the kitty? Should we be preventing it? Should we keep them separated until the cat is neutered? "
767,"Do cucumbers spook cats? If so, why?","There are a bunch of videos going around of cats getting spooked by cucumbers, for example here.  (For more examples, see this dedicated subreddit.)

768,How to keep a teething puppy from biting me and other people?,I have a 9 week old pit bull puppy. He is teething for the first time. I have given him chew toys but if someone goes to pet him he will bit them and try to chew on their hand. It was a cute thing for awhile but it's starting to actually hurt and break skin.

769,Diagnosing a skin condition in a kitten with no qualified vets around,"I have a queen with a litter of 4-weeks-old (as of upcoming Sunday) kittens, and one of the kittens has skin problems. I contacted my regular vets (I have 2), and they weren't able to help.  So, I have a few questions.  Is it possible to do fungal and/or bacterial culture test at home? How? I know close to nothing about this field, but I'm a quick learner. Don't have a microscope though, which can be a problem, but I'll try to get access to one.  What else can it be aside from fungal/bacterial infection? How do I check it? There's one more or less decent vet lab here that can do basic tests, but I have to know what tests to take.  I've more or less resigned myself to being my cats' vet (aside from the legal staff like vet certificates, and surgeries), but I need some guidance, a direction where to search next.  Symptoms.  Only one kitten was affected. Her litter mates and mom are fine.  She developed a crust on the tip of her tail when she was about 1 week old, and a bit of dandruff a bit further on the tail. I didn't pay much attention to it at the time, just noticed that it was there. When she was exactly 2 weeks old, when I was taking photos of the kittens, I noticed that her tail was kind of misshapen, but instead of injury it was just matted at the sides, with hair noticeably thinner at one side, and the crust was still there on the tip of her tail. I contacted one of my vets, she told me to stop overreacting. I waited a couple days, then noticed a matted area with thin hair on the kitten's lower back, and another area, just starting to get matted, a bit further on the back. This time my vet told me to put Miramistin on it twice a day, and that's it. Further 'vet contacts' resulted in them politely flipping me off.  At the moment the kitten has a bald tip of the tail where the crust used to be (I managed to get it off by myself), a bald area further on the tail, a matted area on her lower back with hairs broken a few mm from the skin, another smaller area like that a bit further on the back, and yet another area with broken hairs on her thigh. The tip of the tail seems a bit swollen, but other than that there doesn't seem to be any swelling or reddening. She seems to have itchy paws and ears, although there are no visible signs of anything there. Other than that, she's active, eats well (at least as far as I can tell -- she still breast feeds, doesn't react to solid foods yet), gains weight steadily, and generally seems well, aside from occasional scratching.  Today I borrowed a UV flashlight and scanned all of the kittens, their mom, and the show shelter where I keep them. There were a couple fluorescent flecks on the cats (not green though) but nothing on or inside the shelter. I know it's about 60/40 accuracy, but at least it's something.  Also, my cats are indoor with no access outside whatsoever. The queen is properly vaccinated, was dewormed not long before breeding, and the last time she was on a show was in April, in my own show shelter, and I washed it with chlorhexidile when we got back home. And all of the kitten bedding is washed and ironed thoroughly, and changed regularly. I hardly have any guests, and I got into habit of washing floors near the entrance and around litter boxes with chlorhexidine every other week because of my late kidney cat.  Photos:           "
770,Harness is matting dogs fur,"My Sheltie's fur is not currently at it's adult coat, he's 9 months old. However we've found that it's matting a lot under his front legs - from his harness.  He gets mats behind his ears as well, however we trimmed them all out and now brush in talcum powder which has basically stopped all the mats.  With his 'under arms' as it were we've tried talcum powder but he's still matting a lot in this area where his harness obviously moves and mats the hair.  We originally had a harness similar to:     But now use this exact harness:    When we changed the harness it has improved a little, we can't use only a collar due to the lifestyle we have (regular hiking, if he falls down anywhere on a lead we don't want to have him dangling by his throat therefore choking or breaking his neck...).  The harness does fit correctly, his old one (image one) was worse but in fact too tight, the other is a much better fit. We have two brushes, a slicker and a combo soft bristle / medium spread pin brush.  What can we do to help prevent mats in the area under his front legs? Is the talcum powder route worth continuing?

773,What can I do if my cat is stuck in the washing machine?,"A bit of a story that happened a few months ago, before I ask my question with more detail:  I used to have a 2-month old kitten which me and my mum received from a school friend of mine (her older cat wasn't getting on with the kitten) sometime ago. We used to have cats long before I turned 10, but never really had to go through traumatizing experiences because the house back then was safe. So I moved to England, and moved into a new house which needed some maintenance. We were prepared to welcome in our new cat, trying to minimize the risks of our new kitten getting hurt as much as possible. After like 5 weeks of our kitten settling in, on an ordinary day, I came back home from work experience. After talking for a few minutes with my mum in the kitchen, she went to prepare the laundry for the washing machine. I went upstairs, thinking that my kitten would be playing with toys in my room. We couldn't see her for over 10 minutes which was worrying, seeing that she has a habit of stalking us. We looked into every corner, deeply worried, and then I looked at the washing machine glass door, only to notice that the kitten was spinning inside. I cried instantly, getting my mum over to the kitchen. We had no way of going into the washing machine unless we waited for the water to get sucked out. When we finally got her out, she was shaking and her belly was full of water (lungs were filled with washing chemicals as well). This was the first time we came across such a situation and we didn't know what to do. We held her upside down hoping to get some water out of her, but we didn't know whether this was painful for her. She had let go off her feces which was a sign her body was giving up. Pink liquid was coming out of her eyes, but she was still breathing (struggling, for that matter). I searched the closest vet on my phone and called several times to make sure I know where I am going. The closest vet was down the street I live at, but it was a considerably long distance. I am not especially not good at running, and my mum is too old to run, so I ran with the transporter and phone in my hands panicking like crazy. My mum said she'd follow me shortly. The kitten was taken in by the vet and they checked her situation. When my mum came, the vet announced that she had really low chances because of the water and chemicals in her lungs. The vet inserted drugs as a final method, and told us to go home instead of worrying and waiting. One hour after we got home, we were informed that she stopped breathing.  Now, ever since then, we couldn't forgive ourselves for our carelessness, my mum's friend managed to convince us that the pain and emptiness in the house can be defeated most easily through adopting two cats. And so we adopted two cats after a few days. My mum was hard to convince since she knew she was responsible, but anyway.  We tried really hard up until now to train them to not walk around dangerous things, such as the washing machine or the opening entrance door which is going fine at the moment. (We live near the main road with open staircase)  But, in a case this misfortune happens again, what can we do? Be it if one of the cats is stuck in the machine and we want to get her out as quick as possible... Or when we pull her out and try to get the water out of her lungs?  I'm looking forward to any advice and tips. Thanks in advance. "
774,Five years old and still pees and poops in house and gets into garbage,"I have two five-year-old Jack Russels, from the same litter. One is well behaved, but the other is very poorly behaved. He will pee and poop in the house while I am gone, so I have started crating him whenever I am not home. He also gets into the garbage, even when I am home. We have changed all our trashcans to ones with lids, but he still opens it and gets into it. He rarely listens to commands like sit and come unless there is a treat involved.

The one that I am getting looks a lot fluffier than it's siblings so I was curious as to if it will have long or short hair? I figured it could be possible for one or more of the kittens to have long hair because no one knows who the farther is. I asked but she doesn't know/isn't sure. I was just wondering if anyone on here could tell? How or when could you tell? Pictures of the kitten and one of its siblings below     "
777,Dog sick after boarding,"This has happened twice in the past two months.  I dropped my female, 1 year old, spayed dog off at the boarder for a week.  When I picked her up, she was lethargic (just laying down), hot and sweaty, and had a runny nose.  I think her breath smells mucusy, like a human's when they have a cold.  The first time, this went away after a few days.  I attributed it to being in close continual contact with many other dogs, for the first time in her life.  But, I just picked her up today, and it's happened again.  This boarder has ""open"" boarding.  They don't crate them, but rather let them run around in an indoor area with a concrete floor all day.  I assume they sleep on that floor.  The boarder is staffed 24/7.  The workers seem nice.  The place has good reviews online.  Is this normal?  Would a dog often get sick after a week of boarding (continual play, exposure to other dogs, sleeping on the floor)?  Might she have been too cold at night?  Or could something be wrong?  Edit: She's lethargic for a few days after coming home from the kennel, both times I've left her there for a week.  It's strange because, we can watch her on the webcam playing and having fun, which she seems to do often.   "
778,Ideas about why my dog's prepuce is swollen?,"Bear the dog started chewing on his penis a few weeks ago. We noticed that he seemed to be grooming the area excessively, and within a few days, he seemed very lethargic and I noticed that there was puss on the tip of his penis (which we now know is the ""prepuce""). Took him to an emergency vet who put him in a cone and gave us antibiotics. That helped, but the area was still inflamed, so our regular vet gave us higher dose antibiotics, an anti fungal, and topical antibacterial drops.   With all those drugs, he was throwing up a lot, so the vet took him off of the antibiotics. But not the antifungal or the drops. The vet is pretty clear that he doesn't know what is wrong.  At no point have we noticed a change in urination.   It's now been three weeks and Bear is still super lethargic and he seems uncomfortable. His behavior is hard to describe but he is moping. He is barely willing to eat. He'll eat chicken, and hardcore treats (liver, bacon) but he's not interested in his usual food.  His prepuce is now a fairly healthy shade of pink, no puss, and no intense redness, but it is definitely swollen.   So my question is: are there other things we can do to make him more comfortable? And do you have any ideas about what might be going on? Spider bites? Cancer? STDs?   We're planning to take him to a new vet, but I'd like to come prepared to ask better questions. What should we be researching or asking the vet about?  "
779,Not fully understanding how to properly potty train 9week old dachshund,"First off I want to give a little background information on my situation.  I haven't picked my dachshund up yet and I am doing all my research before hand.  My husband and I both work full time but different dayparts. Some days there will be a 4 to 6 hour gap where neither of us will be home. And some days there will always be a parent home. You  Upon bringing my dachshund home, I have already prepared to take a week off from work to give him constant attention. We do not want to use a crate and this is not negotiable to us - a small pen is something we can work with.  So, from my research I fully understand when to take out our dachshund when I am home. What I am not fully grasping is what exactly to do when we are away from home. Do I leave water in the pen? Is it just wee wee pads lining the floor until a designated spot is created? Or should there be a bed or blanket in there?   My goal is to eventually have our dog be able to enjoy the entire apartment (with limitations to some rooms of course) without coming home to messes, without keeping him confined. Will I always have to have a wee wee pad down when we are away for those periods of time once they are trained or will they eventually be able to hold it (something I read said a puppy can hold its bladder 1 hour for every month of age. 2 months = 2 hours).  To anyone who answers, sorry this is lengthy and I've never posted on a site like this so anything really helps. I want to have a successful potty regime and I am prepared to do the leg work. "

781,Light switches and pets,"I've noticed that the cats I've had over the years don't seem to show any interest in the ambient light in a room.  Say a room is quite dark. I turn on the light switch and it's now bright as day. I notice that the cat's eyes might visibly adjust, but she'll be totally calm. Same for the opposite direction.  This has always puzzled me. Wouldn't you think animals would be more sensitive to instant transitions between day and night? Why doesn't it seem to register as an interesting event?  Do other animals care more? (I know one covers a birdcage at night, for example.) "
782,New shelter dog has chronic ear infection.,"My wife recently adopted a small daug (dachshund/pug mix) and he came with a nasty yeasty ear infection.  We have done some research and have found out that he has been in and out of the local shelter over the past year and went to the owners who gave him to us (an owner kept ""loosing"" him and was in and out of the shelter for 6-7 months)  My guess is they didn't know how to deal with his chronic ear infection and couldn't afford his vet bills. We called his original shelter and they said at intake he was severely underweight and infested with flees.  He was yeasty and had bad ear infections. Looking at all his vet records, he has been WAY over vacinated and on lots of antibiotics.   Now to my question... he is very timid and shy. Not aggressive at all but lacks trust (for obvious reasons). I would like to clean his ears (was going to make a homeopathic remedy) and apply some drops the vet gave him but he is not wanting me to touch his ear.  Should I give him a few days to settle in before I just start messing with his ear?  I don't want the first couple days being associated with me causing him pain.  But I also don't want to just ignore his ear infection.  When I'm ready, I've read lots of tips holding the dog to clean and apply the drops... I just don't want to traumatize him. Thoughts?  I really love this sweet guy... he just needs Us to take care of him since no one else in his life really has.  I think this is going to be an on going issue since his immune system is obviously shot. Any advise is greatly appreciated.  "
783,Do dogs commit suicide?,"One of our dogs is currently under very heavy medication (something similar to cortisone). Our vet who took this stuff herself during an illness described the side effects to be so exhausting it makes death seem the better option sometimes. A person however is capable of understanding the need of the treatment, what causes the side effects and that they will end after treatment. It is impossible to explain this to a dog.  In the last few days our dog fell into the pond several times while he tried to drink. He always drank from the pond before and normally isn't as clumsy, sometimes he really seemed to slip into the pond on purpose. This only happened after the dosage was reduced, before he was too exhausted to go outside most of the time. I am not interested in the cause of this behavior, as I am currently not near the dog and can't really judge the effect of the drugs on him.    Are dogs capable of committing suicide? Are they aware of the consequences their actions have and can chose to die intentionally?  While there are some articles written about this topic, those I've found and the Wikipedia article on animal suicide are inconclusive.  Note: I am interested in research on this subject, opinions or anecdotal evidence can't really answer my question. An answer does not have to be specifically about dogs, but it should show that assumptions made on other animals apply to dogs, too. "

I've read online that in China, fire-bellied toads are commonly found in rice farms among the rice paddies.  Since the water is so shallow, I'm wondering if using rice paddies in a deeper water setup would be a good idea to protect the eggs until they hatch.   I plan to use sandy loam with about an inch or so of soil or other substrate that will keep the water clear on top, then plant long-grain, brown rice and have it drenched in a ton of non-incandescent 6500k light bulbs.    Is this a valid process to follow?  Is there anything else I should know before attempting to do this?  Does anyone have any advice for growing rice paddies inside a vivarium or has anyone ever even had success with this?   Information:   10 gal generic brand aquarium (Potential) vivarium set up (with live plants) Not next to any significant source of natural light 50:50 land/water set up (filtered water, sphagnum moss) 2 fire-bellies (one male, one female, about 1 year-old, active in breeding)  "
785,Can older tarantulas become reaccustomed to being handled?,"My friend has two female Mexican redknee tarantulas.   When he first got them, he handled them on a fairly regular basis, and they were quite docile.  However, they are now both more than 10 years old, and it has been several years since he's handled them.  The last time he tried to pick one up, it acted quite defensive, and kicked off some urticating hairs at him.  Is it too late to retrain them to be comfortable being handled?    If not, how should he go about getting them used to being held, without getting bit or sprayed with the defensive hairs?  "
786,How many shells should be made available for a growing hermit crab?,"It has been many years since I've owned hermit crabs, and I'm thinking about getting some for my son.  I recall that they can be quite choosy about changing shells.  How many empty shells should I provide for them (I haven't yet decided if we'll get one or several)?  Are there any special considerations on what types of shells I should provide? "

788,"Do fish get bored, and if so, how can fish boredom be identified?","There are a lot of opinions on this topic, with a lot of different views. We know from Mythbusters that even goldfish have memories. Is there any reliable science on fish boredom?   For common house pets, like cats, dogs, and rabbits, a bored pet tends to be a destructive pet.  It is hard to imagine a fish destroying your furniture, so what kind of behavior might a bored fish exhibit?    "

791,How to react when a dog lashes-out at his dog friend?,"I have three dogs and I can say that they get along very well 99% of the time they are together (which is technically most of the time).  Sometimes they start a fight out of the simplest thing that might tick them off one time and it might not tick them off the other, so I did a little research and concluded that the ideas that I was considering to be the problem were mostly it, the triggers for that reaction are described here and they make sense.  My question is:  How should I react to this? I figure it's a bit normal that we as humans tend to tense up when your best friends all of the sudden lash-out at each other... My usual reaction was to yell at them to get their attention and carefully break it up withing being accidentally bit or what not.  They've never made themselves bleed or anything that rough, but I don't know if I should continue to yell and break it up or let them handle the dispute as long as it doesn't get too violent? ...And please don't take me wrong, I do not condone any sort of dog fighting or anything like that, but I'm realistic about the fact that they are still animals (as much as we love them) and I might be getting in the way of something that comes natural to them?  Let me specify that they do this 1% of the time so it's been probably 2, 3 occasions in a 2 to 3 year span, and as soon as I break them up I don't separate them into different rooms or anything like that, I just standby ready to see if they still feel aggressive against each other but it's usually the other way around, they'll be licking each other's scuffle wounds.  Just as a final note for what it's worth, they don't always lay down in the same place, we leave the doors open around the house so sometimes one is in another room; so I guess what I'm saying is that it's optional to them if they want to be together (they usually are). "
792,How vulnerable are crossbred (hybrid) dogs to genetic disease?,"Most purebred dogs are prone to breed-specific diseases, for example, hip dysplasia in Labrador Retrievers.  Mixed-breed (mongrel) dogs are said to be less prone to genetic diseases than purebred dogs due to higher genetic diversity.    Does this also hold true for crossbred dogs?   How likely are crossbred dogs (aka ""designer"" or ""hybrid"" dogs) to inherit breed-specific diseases of either or both parent breeds?  Are crossbred dogs healthier in general, compared to their parents?  "

794,Puppy not paying attention when excited,"Our 6 month old Pitbull is incredibly friendly and well behaved (for the most part anyway).  We like to take him on walks, and responds well to basic commands. He stops at corners with us before crossing the street and while he still lags a bit or gets ahead to sniff stuff, I believe we're close to getting it right.  The problem is that when he gets excited (ie: when he sees other dogs) it seems like everything he's learned goes out the window.  Just yesterday, he tried to run to the other sidewalk when he spotted a couple of dogs behind a fence. He was totally oblivious to a car that was approaching and I don't want to delve on what could have happened if he hadn't been on a leash.  When this happens, he doesn't even respond to his name.  There's absolutely no indication of aggressiveness. Like I said, he's just incredibly friendly, as are all the dogs we've met in out neighborhood, so he often plays with dogs we meet when on our walks.  Is this normal for a 6-month-old?  Is there something we can do?  I'd like to make our commands more important than his impulses? "
795,3 tetras and a betta,I have just purchased a 10 gallon fish tank. I have one male betta and 3 tetras.   Two of the tetras swim around together but one of them stays at the bottom of the tank in the corner and looks like he's swimming but he's not going anywhere. I was told by the lady in the shop that it would be okay to not cycle the tank before adding them.  Any ideas on why he's doing this? Or any ways to help him? 
796,Why are all pups born at the same time?,"I live in India, alongside 30 Million stray dogs.  90% of female dogs have given birth to pups in November-December. You can see a pup every 10 m you walk here. Why is this happening? Why do all dogs are having pups at the same time?  Edit: I read on the net and found that Indian stray dog, named pariah goes into heat once a year during mating season August - Jan. Their gestation period is 2 months so November- December is when most pups are born. But why do pariahs, unlike most others go into heat once and all at the same time?  You can read about their mating season in Wikipedia or any other site. I could not find the explanation. Thank you. "

798,Is it safe to let my cat sleep completely covered in blanket where oxygen supply becomes very low?,"In this winter my cat's favorite sleeping place is under my blanket. Even when I am not present she likes to sleep there. Since she is unable to lift the blanket herself to get inside I need to lift it so that see can get inside. I understand when she wants to get inside blanket from her act of scratching the side of blanket with her paws and trying to lift the blanket with her teeth.  Now I am concerned regarding oxygen availability inside the blanket. In the conditions in which she sleeps I would have suffocated to death. But if I try to lift the blanket and place it up to her neck freeing her nostrils, she doesn't like it and slips further inside to get fully covered again. I don't understand how she sleeps peacefully in such suffocating conditions?  Is it all right to let her sleep like that? Is there any chance of accident? "

I try to maintain the right temperature by placing heating mat under the tank. I try to maintain right humidity by misting the enclosure daily. So I don't think that environment is a problem.  I keep a gut loaded cricket at night but at morning I find that the scorpion has not eaten it.  I am now really worried about her. I don't want her to fall sick? What should I do?

803,Is my cat's behaviour normal?,"Over the past few months, I've been trying to figure out the differences between the two black cats I had for about 5 months. They are about 8 months old and they come from the same litter.  Luna, the much smaller one is a bit quieter than Chilli, the one my inquiry is about. Luna meows when she needs to unlike Chilli, and overall behaves like all of our past cats.  Chilli however, caught my attention through doing things like;   Rapidly opening her mouth - imagine a dog catching a treat mid-air - only to close it, with no real reason. She does that around 5 times in half an hour, if nothing in the living room happens and every house member is minding their own business. When I pet her on the head, she gets so 'excited' that she opens her mouth. Sometimes, she even keeps her mouth open for the next two minutes, even when I had already stopped petting her. Unlike Luna, Chilli frequently makes a journey to the kitchen and often gets caught eating some of the leftovers from the plates in the sink. We often eat spaghetti and once Chilli sees that we are finished with the plate, she excitedly jumps up and licks the sauce leftovers until there's none left. (We do not eat Spaghetti with any kind of meat) She never rubs herself against any of the house members, or her sister, or the furniture, nor even the walls. Not from what I have seen at least. Luna however does it very often.   Aside from these actions, Chilli behaves just like our past cats. The question is, should I be worried? Or is this normal for her to be like this, considering every cat can be different? "
804,What happens when a gold fish pond freezes?,"I used to have a neighbor with a gold fish pond, and large (8 inch, 20 CM) or bigger gold fish (Koi?).  The pond was only about a foot deep and would often freeze over and/or freeze solid.  As I recall the fish seemed to survive for years of this freeze and thaw process.  What happens when a gold fish pond freezes? "
805,Resolving Jack Russel dog problems,"The problem is that my Jack Russel female dog is not normal. We adopted it two years ago and we still have behavior problems with it. We live in an apartment two floors high. We tried to teach it to don't pee or defecate in our sofa but didn't succeed even that we went out with it at the beginning 4 times and then 3 times a day. We had also other problems so we decided to take a dog trainer. The dog trainer gave the idea of a dog cage. We bought it a cage and thought this would resolve the problem.  But no, sometimes it would pee or defecate in the apartment; even in its own cage. How is that possible? I have heard that one of the worst things dog would want to have is defecate or pee in its own bed. So how can that happen? Also, some days ago it peed on our kitchen table when someone left it alone, when my sibling went to the second floor for some time, why is this?  Also, why is it so stubborn? I have a family that doesn't follow the rules 100% but I can say we follow the most? So why does it put its legs on the sofa when we have asked it to not do so?  I know that Jack Russel is a really really stubborn and difficult breed of dog to start, but this case of dog is not normal and would want some help please. Maybe some tips and/or some way to understand its mind. "
806,Rabbit scratching and rubbing her teeth on her litter box?,"So my rabbit was sick, and we took her to the vet one night, and we put her in a new cage (smaller) and we would put her back in her big cage when she felt a bit better.  So once we put her in her new cage which was around 2-3 months ago,we put her back in her big cage within 2 weeks of her in the small cage. Ever since she was in the new big cage she's started to rubbing her teeth kind of like chewing it but on the bottom on the litter box, and scratching at her litter box? I cleaned the litter box with vinegar and baking soda, I need to cut her nails soon, and I've given her toys to wear her teeth down on but she just keeps doing it! It bugs me because she's 70% of the time doing it. She is a Netherland Dwarf and spends 3 - 4 hours per day outside of her cage.  Any suggestions? Also, when she was in this cage before, she never did this.. "
807,Is it ok to move dog crate from room to room?,"I am getting a labrador puppy in a few weeks and we are planning on crate training him. We are trying to decide where to place the crate and we think that we want him to be in the living room with us when we are in there, but at night and when we are out we would rather he was in a different room. Is there any negative effects caused by moving the crate to different locations? Should the crate be placed in a single location and left there all the time? "
808,Newly adopted Black & Tan Coonhound lunging at 2 young children,"I have a small rescue and recently adopted a young Black &amp; Tan Coonhound girl to a family with 2 young elementary school age children.  Shandy is a sweet dog, but sometimes without warning she will lunge at the kids' faces. There is no growling involved and is usually centering around food.  With the little boy, he was sitting down at the dinner table when Shandy lunged at him catching his chin.  This resulted in a small cut and bruise on the child's chin.  Also, the little girl was eating something, and Shandy lunged at her face but luckily missed it when the child jumped away.  Shandy has never tried this with either mom or dad. The family is thinking that Shandy might not be a good fit for them but would still like some helpful suggestions. I suggested that we get a trainer in the home to assess the situation.  The second option would be to just return Shandy to our rescue.  Can you shed any light on this situation?  Is there a certain type of family Shandy should go to in light of what is happening...maybe one with no kids?  Thank you! Pam "

810,Moving has caused my cat's night-life to eat away at my actual life,"We've recently moved from a house to an apartment.    We've had this cat for quite some time, and it has moved with us twice before. Both the other times, the cat would disappear for a few days (under a couch) and then start settling down.  We introduced him to the new house using the following method:     We released him from his carrier in the living room, near his food/water and litter box The first day we kept him there The second day we opened up the hallway to let him explore   However since we opened up the hallway, the nights have gotten worse and worse, and we have since closed that door again. Around 3, to 3:30 in the morning the cat starts.     Jumping against doors / trying to open doorknobs Meowing loudly Growling Going to the litter-box several times in a row, burying something that isn't there   If we leave the doors open from the living room where he spends all of his time, to our bedroom, he will cry out in-front of our bedroom door until one of us wakes up. If we lock him in the bedroom he'll cry at the door to the hallway. (this was a bad idea) If we keep him in the living room he'll cry at the door to the hallway.  The only thing that seems to calm him down is our presence. If we walk around with him (he'll follow us non-stop at night) he's fine and quiet. If we go and sleep in the living room on the couch (yes, I just spent a night sleeping on the couch because of my cat) he'll purr for a while and remain quiet.  He seems to want us to be in the living room. And I have no idea why. It only works if it's me or my girlfriend, if our kid is with him he'll just hide and cry out from his hiding spot.    During the day, he's his usual self. He sleeps on the back of the couch. He's only scratching his posts. He's not peeing anywhere he shouldn't. He's not crying out during the day. He comes when we call his name, and he's eating normally.  I'm not sure what's causing this? Is my cat scared of being alone? Is there some smell or sound that's making him anxious at night? I'm a bit sleep deprived now and really annoyed at the animal. "
811,Should I always take everyone to the vet?,"As a rule we all (pets and parents) go to the vet together. Everyone lives together and shares the same resources, so if one is sick, it seems reasonable to get everyone checked out.  If it's annual physical time, well everyone needs one.    If one has a physical issue that is not communicable like a hair ball we still take the family group, for moral support during the trip and while waiting.    The only time everyone does not go, is if the pet does not have a partner (lives in a segregated area) and is going in for a follow up on a non-communicable issue.   Am I just being over cautious/sensitive?  Are there medical/psychological issues that make including or excluding everyone from a trip to the vet the better choice? "

As a resting/nesting place.   Would a cockatiel like this?   Is cardboard safe? "
815,Fish eating dead fish with columnaris,"My tank recently had a small outbreak of columnaris (my fault since I didn't use a QT tank for new fish) The disease surprisingly and thankfully did not spread to any other fish that I know of except for the ones who already had it. I did not separate the sick because I assumed the water had already been infected and I should treat the whole tank for it rather than just the infected since all of the fish might have been exposed.   One of the infected died today and I didn't see it due to the plants and decorations until I noticed my pleco feasting upon one of the sick's body (which I removed prompty). Would this be worse than the normal symptoms of the outbreak, and would I need anything special for this? I've started treatment with Furan-2 already. Would this treatment still work if the fish ate the columnaris? Or would I now need something more ? "

821,Can I give anti-rabies vaccine (PE Prophylaxis) to a 25-day-old puppy because he was bitten by a symptomatic rabid dog?,"I found a severely traumatized puppy in front of my home, two days ago. Brought her home and found two bite marks on the sides of her head. Upon asking around the locality, we realized she had been bitten by an aggressive dog the day before. The next day we found the perpetrator dog convulsing and dying in front of us. Some people say he died of rabies, some say he was hit on the head by a man that caused brain injury. We can never be too sure.   Now about this 25 day old puppy who has been bitten. Because the perpetrating dog has died, and that too showing symptoms of aggression and convulsion, we can't take a chance. One vet told she can't tolerate a post exposure prophylaxis course and die in a few days. Another told she can well tolerate it. The third one said she can only be administered 3 doses of 0 - 3 -7 and no more.  We also have an adult dog at home (vaccinated). Will he require a prophylaxis too because he sniffs the affected puppy and licks her urine?   What to do now? We administered her with one ARV 1ml SC yesterday (60 hrs after exposure), but will she die? She is ostensibly OK till now after 12 hours.I'm very much confused whether to continue the prophylaxis course or not give her anything due to high death risk by vaccine at such young age.  Please help.   "

824,Managing the gradual induction of stray cat into my life,"I think one of the five stray cats that visit my verandah has taken a liking to me and she hung around for a really long time (45+ minutes) staring at me through my large glass windows AFTER she had been fed. She looked playful and was pouncing around and meowing a lot.  I really like this cat a lot but my apartment contract doesn't allow pets on the premises. My landlord is however sympathetic to stray cats.  My question is, I would eventually like to take this cat in as the time progresses and bring it back to the United States with me in 2015 (I am in France right now for a year). I understand the paperwork necessary for this. My question focusses on the ""integration"" part of a separate answer here.  However, in the time being, how should I ""adopt"" this cat without necessarily letting her into my house? If I don't let her into my house, would this cat see this as ""being shut out of my life"" and leave for good? Or would she continue to come back to me as we have a ""feeding cadence"" of twice a day now. Also, I have always considered cats to be rather intelligent creatures (this one is a tuxedo cat). Would my forced indifference towards her translate into rudeness in cat language?  I am afraid that if I do leave on a mandatory 1 month trip next month, she will think I am gone for good and leave. "
825,Do rabbits experience menopause?,"I got a question third hand, (friend > wife > me) and a quick search leaves me wondering where to look for the answer.   The friend has an 11 year old female rabbit that has not been spayed. She wants to know if rabbits experience menopause, and what if any similarities it has with human menopause (transition to a non-reproductive state, with associated symptoms)  A quick glance at Wikipedia teaches us that rabbits are induced ovulators which means they don't have normal cycles, they ovulate in response to sex. So obviously there are going to be some differences from humans.  The closest scientific study I find is Efficacy of red clover isoflavones in the menopausal rabbit model. which uses ""experimentally induced menopause"" to test a drug. So while not really addressing this question does provide for the probability of a rabbit/human similarity.   Do rabbits experience menopause? At what age, and what kind of symptoms? Are they able to reproduce until they die of old age (16+ years old)? "
826,Teach cats to stay close in unfenced area,"We have two cats that we would love to take to a summer house with us for weekends during at least half of the year. The idea is that we'll be heading there on Friday and returning on Sunday night/Monday morning. Both cats are very close to us and one of them would really miss us if we left him for two nights. The house is not fully fenced and in my experience taking my more curious cat around, there's no fence that would stop him. The land around the house is around 600 square meters/6500 square foot of grass and trees for them to play, and even though there's no fence there are plants that mark its limits. Coming from the city that is a lot of land for them, however, last weekend, we took the more curious one over there (he's also the more adaptable) and he was already trespassing to neighbour's houses. What can we do to keep them in our property? How can we teach them not to go far from us? "
827,What are the signs that a female platy fish is about to give birth?,"I have a 10 US gallon tank that has been up and running for about 6 days. I purchased 2 female and 1 male platys and they have been in it for about 4 days.  I believe both females are pregnant (they both have dark abdomens and are getting bigger), although one has gotten significantly fatter over the past few days. She obviously came pregnant from the fish store, pregnant with another male fish's sperm.  I am planning for a breeder box birth in the tank but I need to know when to put her in there.  What are the signs that she is going to give birth? When should I put her in the breeder box?  Additional information:  Today I noticed the very pregnant platy chasing the male around aggressively. I believe this is one of the signs but I am not sure. "

829,Can Rabbits tell time?,"You may be familiar with the rabbit from Alice's Adventures in Wonderland as illustrated by John Tenniel.     But my rabbit does not have a pocket watch, yet she often manages to get up on the bed minutes before the alarm goes off.  The only clock in the room is a digital alarm, that it is not possible to see unless you are on the bed, so I can't see her checking it through the night without waking me up.  I have heard from a few others who share a bedroom with a rabbit that it is not unusual for them to be up on the bed shortly before the alarm goes off, for some snuggles.  Unlike cats and dogs, rabbits seem to prefer something solid under them when sleeping, so they generally move to the floor for the night. Maybe once a month or so she will wake up in the middle of the night and get up on the bed, grabs a quick snuggle and back to the floor, but usually she waits until 5 to 15 minutes before the alarm goes off.    If the alarm clock was a wind up, you could make the argument that there is a sound made by the clock before the alarm goes off.  But the only non-digital clock in the house is a battery clock in the kitchen (she does not have physical access to the kitchen) and it does not have an alarm.    Can Rabbits tell time? Or maybe the better question is; How do Rabbits tell time? "
830,Increasing dog life span,"I lost my cocker spaniel almost a year ago who I'd had for over 14 years. He was my best friend and I still miss him every day. I've always known that one day this would happen, but now that it has I know it's harder than I thought it would be.  My question is, is there anyone out there trying to breed dogs to live longer? If not so, why not?  People breed dogs for all kinds of purposes. Fighting dogs, hunting dogs, racing dogs, but will they ever admit that companion dogs give to you just as much as you give to them. "
831,Is my dog getting enough walks and eating enough food?,"Information about my dog   Name - Kairo Breed - Korean Jindo Color - Brown Age - 2 years and 5 months old Gender - Male Weight - 15 kg     Weight  He looks thin, is this normal for Korean Jindos?  Elimination Habits  When Kairo was a puppy, he use to pee and poop in the corner of the house. But after he turned like 5 months old, I started to walk him once a day. When I started to walk him everyday, he stopped peeing or pooping in the house. But sometimes I could not walk him every single day, and when I don't walk him, he will hold up and does not pee nor poop. Once I didn't walk him for 2 to 3 days, and he still held on to it. I try to let him do it but he won't. He will just wait for me to walk him.   I got really worried about his urinary and excretory system, so after that experience, I walk him twice a day, morning and evening. Is this enough? I'm still not sure. He drinks about 3 to 3 1/2 cups of water a day. Is this routine healthy for him?   Meals  And also, he doesn't finish his meals. I give him one cup in the morning and another cup in the evening, but he will only eat the half of it each time. So all in all he is eating just one cup in a day, which I'm really worried about. He doesn't eat the food all at once; he will eat like few bites, then after an hour, he'll take another few bites, and so on (but still eats only half of it). I'm really worried seeing him getting thinner. :( I walk him like 1 hour to 2 hours in the morning but still no changes. Is this routine okay for his health? "
832,Domesticating wild mice?,"My house is under attack by mice.  Droppings everywhere, holes in boxes and plastic bags.  I'm not a killer, so, I decided to use a humane trap.  With it, I caught 8 mice in 2 days, not bad.  But I only decimated them, not eradicated them, so more to go.  I can hear them at night.  I'm quite happy with my traps and bait; the problem is now the weather is 10F degrees outside, and 20"" of snow.  I won't put the mice out there until it's a bit warmer, but I can't just not trap them, either.  I've got a mouse now that I've trapped and placed in an empty fish tank, I just lined the bottom with paper towels and placed a dish of water and bait for food.  I know next to nothing about keeping mice, my intention is to release any that I catch as soon as the weather turns; but how do I care for them in the meantime?  Do I have to worry about disease, or fleas, or getting bitten?  What happens if I do get bit?  The mouse, by the way, is having a temper tantrum, ostensibly from getting caught.  He (or she) has already torn up all of the paper towels into confetti, after one night, and seems to be testing the best choice places to eliminate his/her bowels.  That includes in the water bowl and food dish.  And everywhere else.  So, how often do I have to change the linings, food, and water?  And for posterity, I might as well learn how to sex the mouse... how do I do that?  And if I manage to catch more, should I keep them together or put them in separate tanks?  I don't want babies.  (I have one more tank suitable for this purpose, the others I have are not large enough or don't have adequate covers on top). "
833,How many ghost shrimp can I put in a 20g tank with 7 neon tetras?,"I have a 20g fish tank, dimensions are around 18in high, 24in length, 12in wide.  Currently it contains 7 neon tetras, a plastic column, and a plastic plant (medium size, about as tall as the tank and around 6 inch diameter base).  I'm looking to get some more creatures for my tank, and have been looking at ghost shrimp. Can I add them? According to this calculator, I'm perfectly fine with a 1:1 ratio of ghost shrimp to neon tetras.   However, is that healthy for both the tetras and ghost shrimp? Should I try to have  a 2:1 with more tetras than shrimp, or does it not really matter?  "
834,"My dog keeps twisting his body, arching his back, and rubbing his back and butt on walls and bushes","The thing is, it's only when we're on our way back from a walk. Leaving the house and walking is fine, he'll rub some bushes but he won't arch his back or bite/sniff his rear. But when we're homeward bound he begins to do this. Should I be concerned? Has anyone else seen this behavior before?  I should mention he is a 5 year old Cockapoo and is fixed. "
835,Liquid Dial dish soap for flea-soap(shampoo) usage,"Looking for answer that is scientific in nature and not just an opinion.  When using dial (on my cat) it helps kill the fleas, sometimes better than even cheap flea-shampoos do. But like those cheap shampoos, does it or does it not kill all 4 stages in a flea's life cycle (ex. some shampoos don't kill eggs)??  Question 2 is using dial first before a store-bought, flea-shampoos does it cover say the eggs with a layer that the flea-shampoo doesn't penetrate to kill the egg?? "
836,Cleaning to rid house of cat allergen after cat is gone,"We discovered through a blood test that our 3yo is severely allergic to cats. We have two cats who are 7 and 8 respectively and we're adopted as kittens. So their hair and dander is all over everything in our house. We are finding new homes for that cats, but I have the painstaking chore of cleaning their hair and dander off/out of everything in the house. I know it will take a while to really clean the house and it will never be entirely free of all hair.  I am trying to figure out the best way to clean so the allergen is dead or denatured so it does not affect my daughter. Will washing clothes and other linens in very hot water kill whatever it is in the hair and dander that causes a reaction? So that even if the hair is present, it won't affect her? Is there a kind of soap or other agent I can use?  Fortunately, we have no carpeting in the house, but we do have rugs. And since we live in a cold climate, we also have lots of thick, heavy blankets of various textiles and materials.  While I'm asking, I'm open to pretty much any tips that can be offered to clean up after the cats! Thank you! "
837,Dogs stop eating pinto beans - why?,I eat healthfully and many healthy foods are cost effective.     If I am cooking beans (mainly pinto) that day I add one cup of beans each for each dog and feed them the beans over dog food.    They used to love it but lately they hate beans.  These are unseasoned pinto beans that I let cool. Both dogs are typically fast eaters.  For them both to not like beans the exact same day seems odd. Maybe they got into something to upset their bellies?  I will get them dried dog food tomorrow but why would a dog not like cooked beans?  It's not a bad package of beans - these are the same beans I eat.  Any ideas? 
838,How to remove mold/algae from the stones in a fish tank?,"I've noticed recently that the white stones in my fish tank are starting to have something brown growing on them, which I suspect to be mold/algae. The mold/algae also seems to be slowly increasing over time.   How do I remove the mold/algae? And how do I prevent the mold/algae from returning?   Edit  Here is a picture of my fish tank. We have a filter which you can partially see at the back. You can see that the white stones have some brown things on them, but interestingly it only happens on some of the stones. The fish tank also has several brown spots.   "
839,What standards exist in the US for pet food?,"Are there any legal standards in the US requiring specific levels of content and/or nutrition in commercial foods for any type of pet?  If so for what types of pets, and where can they be found?   I would only be interested in voluntary standards, if legal standards do not exist.  "
840,How much dominance is expected from two male chickens of different breeds?,"I have 7 female and 2 male chickens. The females are Leghorn.  One male is Leghorn, but the other is a Plymouth Rock. The 2 males fight for everything: food, water, and mostly to mate the females. Despite multiple female choices, they still fight just to mate one.   Is this a normal dominance behavior? I think it is excessive. What can I do to stop this?  "
841,Choosing a second fish for a lone goldfish,"I have a lone goldfish, a comet, about 10 cm long from tip to tail. I want to buy a second fish  and am wondering about size.  Is it ok to introduce a much smaller goldfish, or maybe three smaller goldfish; so they are a little protected group and not an odd number,I don't want any of them to be left out. Or is it preferable to get a fish a similar size to my existing fish?  I am looking for some expert advice.  Without concern for pond size, what are the general guidelines for matching fish like this for size?  Is there a danger a smaller goldfish could be eaten by the larger goldfish?  edit  I am wanting to know about matching goldfish (in this case comets), as opposed to what will or will not fit in my pond. The dimensions of my pots were brought up in the comments, but it is not answering my question about the compatibility of the fish with regard to size (in this case, comets).  edit 2  I have been investigating fish ponds for the past 4 years. In the meantime, my neighbors gave me their goldfish. I am wanting to learn about the fish, prior to buying a large fish pond.  "
842,How smart are ferrets?,"It's been several years since my ferrets passed on, but I was quite impressed with just how smart they were (well, really only one of my two... the other was sweet, but wasn't particularly bright).  My male surprised me several times with what appeared to be some fairly clever problem-solving.    For example, he was obsessed with getting into the trash can.  To do this, he started by reaching up, hooking his claws into the plastic liner (which he could just barely reach), and then putting his weight on it until the can tipped over (I caught him swinging back and forth while dangling from the liner to tip the can).  I solved this by raising the can up so it was too high for him to reach the top.  He responded by opening the bottom cabinet drawer next to the can, climbing in, then opening the one above, climbing into that one, and on until he reached the top (using them like stairs).  As much as I love my cats, I can't imagine them doing anything quite so involved.  I know intelligence is an incredibly difficult thing to quantify, but have there been any credible studies on ferret intelligence, particularly in the area of problem solving capabilities?  How do they rank compared to other common pets?   "
843,Are rabbits really the third most popular pet?,"I have heard that rabbits are currently the third most popular pet in the United States, is this true?  Is popularity dependent on country (and if so how is it measured)?  I know from experience that shelters in the Pittsburgh Pa (USA) area who take all kinds of pets get more bunnies then any other non Dog/Cat animal.  Where ""Popular"" is defined by a studies criteria   OR  Where Popular is number of animals owned in a non-commercial (household) count. "
844,Do plecos keep their territory permanently?,"I have a new pair of clown plecos, and need to reshape the tank a little bit to give them more hiding places. They're still small (about two inches) and have only been in the tank about a week, but neither one has really claimed a permanent territory.  How will they use the ""pleco caves"" that are available?  Once they've settled in and have more options to choose from, will they each pick a space and stick with it over time, or will they just grab the first convenient hiding place every day? "
845,Need strategy to add an exterior ramp for my geriatric welsh collie,"We have moved and need to accommodate our welsh collie's toilet and outside needs. At the moment we need to take him up and down some steps at both the front and rear of the house. He is 19 years old, largely blind, and arthritic in hind legs and spine, so he needs some help to manage this.   He is used to a dog flap, but the house we are in now is quite high off the ground at the rear, where we would wish to put the dog flap. My partner is not very handy, and although we talked about constructing a ramp, I think my dog will have passed away before that happens.  We agreed we will need a ramp with sides so he will not fall off due to his blindness.  Right now when we walk him down the steps to give him the confidence to get down (although we sometimes carry him, 23kg), he feels the edge of the steps with his front paw to know where to step.  He is old, but still smart.   Has anyone tried 'stacking' 2 commercially available dog ramps end to end to make a long ramp?  Some appear to be suitable, if we just made a 'bridge' platform to secure them on.   Can some ramps be secured?  I have looked at both the Solvit Ultralite Bi Fold Dog Ramp (seems short) and Easipet Dog Ramp - both have sides.  I could really use some advice if anyone has tried this. "
846,Do ferrets get along with other pets?,"While reading about things to know when acquiring a ferret, I came across this article that says that ferrets do not get along with other pets:     Most ferrets don't get along with birds, fish, rabbits, rodents, lizards, and the like, though there are some exceptions. For a dog or cat, patience is the most important part of the introduction. Give the new animal a chance to get used to you and your home before introducing it to the other pets one at a time, very slowly.    Is it true that ferrets don't get along with other pets? If it is true:  How will bringing in a new pet affect them? What steps can I take to help them get along with new pets?   "
847,Should I bathe my hamster?,"While reading the Hamsterific hamster FAQ, I read about never giving hamsters a bath.     That's a naughty word in the hamster world; hamsters don't like water sports. Nature has provided hamsters with a natural oil to maintain the condition of their fur. That's why they spend so much time grooming. Although they can swim, water baths are not recommended. If a wet hamster becomes cold, it can lead to flu and possibly death.   The last line really puzzled me. It inferred that wetting a hamster could lead to its death.   Is it true that wetting a hamster could be fatal for it?  If so, how effective is their skin oil at keeping their skin clean and comfortable? Should I bathe my hamster?  "
848,What do I need to know before adopting an FIV-positive cat?,"When I adopted my current cats last year, the folks at the shelter asked me if I would consider adopting some of their Feline Immunodeficieny Virus (FIV)-positive cats since I did not have any other cats at the time.  The adoption counselor and I briefly discussed what this would entail, but since I had just come off of 6+ years of treating complicated diseases of elder cats, I wasn't ready for that challenge at that time.  But the counselor, the brochure she gave me, and the time I spent with Google didn't give me a very thorough understanding of the issues.  So, because this question could come up again in the future, I'd like to know what the practical issues are in caring for an FIV-positive cat.  Is day-to-day life pretty much the same as for other cats until the cat gets older?  If not, what's different?  (Diet, medicines, more-frequent vet visits?)  Once the disease starts producing effects on the cat's health, what does an owner need to do to keep the cat comfortable and as healthy as possible?  I realize that every cat is different; as much as possible I'm looking for what is typical and how much variation there is. "
849,My dog seems to be scared of jumping up on our bed,"My 3 year old boxer mix seems to have  a problem when we ask her to jump on our bed. She used to do it with no problem at all, but about three months ago she jumped on our bed, stepped over us, got scared and fell off the bed. Now you can see that she really wants to jump up, but she just doesn't, eventually she lays by the side of the bed or she goes to her own bed, even when we show her that there is free space.  Is she scared or do you think she could have some kind of injury?   How can we make her feel that it is ok to jump on our bed? "
850,What should I consider before deciding to adopt a ferret?,"I want to adopt a ferret in addition to my dog and chickens.   The answers to ""Do ferrets get along with other pets?"" suggest ferrets will have no problems with other pets as long as they still get your attention.  The answers to ""How can I prevent my ferrets from smelling bad?"" indicate ferrets have a natural skin oil which might smell bad, so I need to pay attention to their diet and clean their cage regularly.   Are there other concerns I need to know before adopting a ferret? "
851,Is dry food completely uniform? My cat always leaves half and wants more,Even with smaller portions he leaves a lot behind. Next meal time he wants food from the bag.  Should I suspect the quality of a portion of the food in the bag? Is dry food controlled to be completely uniform? 
852,Why my cat loves to drink ice cold cow milk and is it safe to offer so?,My cat generally doesn't drink any milk. But she loves to drink ice cold cow milk.  So my question is why is it so? And is it safe to offer so? Note that there is very little chance of food infection for milk not being boiled as it is treated pasteurized packet milk from reputable company.  Other than lactose intolerancy I want to know whether there is any chance of toncilitis on giving my cat ice cold milk?

855,What is a right time to start training a puppy?,"I have brought a Labrador Retriever puppy home 4 days back. She is 50 days old. We have not introduced her to any leash or crate or anything.  When should we start training her for it and how?  I have mainly 2 problem areas :   Teeth biting on hands and legs. We have got her couple of chew toys but she still prefers our hands and legs. When we are at home, she has to be beside us all the time. While sleeping as well she will draw attention by making some sound and she will sleep only when we sleep beside her. She is doing pee and poo anywhere. What is the right age we should be starting training her for this??  "
856,Why are feral cats slowly blinking back at me?,"I read that slow blinking is a sign of relaxation. Since most feral cats are afraid of humans, I slowly blink at them. I have noticed that many cats return this slow blink at me.   Why are they returning the slow blink? Does this mean I can go near a feral after slowly blinking at them? I have never tried to go near them after slowly blinking.  Edit: The question I mentioned - Is blinking slowly at cats a way to tell them that you love them? "
857,Why are my fish always scared?,"I have a tank with four 1.5"" Shubunkins, which I've had for one month. There are no other fish. It is a glass-bottom tank with no substrate (for easy cleaning), and has many floating plants for them to hide in. The tank is equipped with just an AquaClear filter and an auto-feeder.  Whenever someone approaches the tank, all of the fish run into the plants, and won't come out. They only swim around when they don't see anyone nearby. I've never seen any other fish behave this way, except maybe catfish.  Why might the fish always be scared? Is that a sign there is something wrong with the tank? "
858,"Pet Insurance: with no pedigree for a street-rescued cat, is it necessary to disclose suspected but unconfirmed breed?","If one has a cat they're pretty sure is a Manx - he has a short tail - but rescued him from the side of the road, is it necessary to when signing him up for pet insurance to tell them the breed he seems to be?  He was found on the side of the highway as a kitten, injured and starving, many years ago. He came running as soon as he saw a human pull over and hold her arms out to him; he seemed to have been abandoned, he seemed diseased and unhealthy then. He got good vet treatment at the time. He's now about 6, and is quite healthy overall, though has always loved food, presumably because of the trauma of not having it as a kitten, and is a bit overweight - he particularly loves bread (wtf weird cat??) and creme fresh. Food puzzles and portion control have been helping with his weight, but he's not there yet. Since he's probably a Manx, he'll probably live to about 20. He's quite intelligent and acts as the caretaker of the other two cats he lives with.   We'd like to sign them all up for pet insurance; but insurance quotes, if we say he's a pedigreed manx, seem to be much more expensive. Nobody has ever actually said ""yes, that's officially a manx cat""; it's conceivable that he lost his tail while he was lost in the woods as a kitten. But even then, manxes are a healthier breed, unlike most other breeds, so you'd expect insurance to be cheaper.  Does it make sense, since we don't have pedigree papers, to sign him up for pet insurance as a generic breed? Or do we have to say ""he's specifically a manx"" even though we've never confirmed that? We're obviously hoping for the former, but want to make sure it's actually ok to do before just going ahead with it. "
859,Aloe Vera and Cats,"I read that the ASPCA has listed Aloe Vera as mildly toxic to cats.   a) Does that only mean toxic to ingest, or even live in a house with such a plant? If I'm sure my cat does not chew on the plant, is it safe to keep around?  b) How can some high-end pet foods contain aloe, if eating it is toxic?   (I'm not trying to cause controversy, I'm just wondering what's the case and what's safe for my cat. I've also seen this question, which agrees with the ASPCA rating.) "
860,How can I raise some red earthworms for my turtle?,"I've recently attained a culture of about 20-50 red earthworms, and I'm planning to use them to feed my turtle. I'm currently leaving them in a 14 inch * 5 inch * 5 inch deep planting pot, with soil of about an inch deep. The soil I'm using is some soil we had previously from a plant in a pot we're no longer using.   I'd like to know the basic directions to raising this culture. I want to know what I can add for the soil to make it more ""nutritious"" for the worms as well as gut loading them for the turtle. Moreover, I'd want to know if the size enclosure I'm using is appropriate, and how often I need to water the soil and whether I need to add more.   optional:  How long should I expect them to take until they reproduce? And should I avoid feeding them to my turtle till then?  "
861,How to hold my dog in place to clean his ears?,"My dog (a German Shepherd mix) has a severe ear infection and needs ear drops twice a day and an ear flush once a day. He absolutely hates this, and as a result I have not been very successful in cleaning his ears. I'm concerned that if I can't flush his ears properly, the ear drops won't have much of an effect. He weighs over 50 pounds and has plenty of energy, so it's difficult keeping him still.  I read that you should place your dog on a table at about chest level, but I live in a small apartment and the closest thing I have that is that height would either be my stove or my computer desk, two things I definitely don't want him jumping up on.  I live alone and cannot rely on having a friend help me every time. So far I've been leading my dog into the bathroom and giving him treats, then getting ahold of his collar and leading him into a corner. I then wrap my arm around his head to get to his ear, and attempt to apply the ear drops. If I had an extra couple hands at this point, I would also hold his body so I don't feel like I have him in a headlock, and use the other hand to give him treats.  He generally stays quiet (with the occasional yelp), so I don't think I'm hurting him. He just fights very hard to escape my grasp. How can I hold him still long enough to properly clean and treat his ear infection? A friend recommended some kind of large treat/chew toy, but what could I get him that would keep him in place? "
862,What can I do when the cone of shame is too heavy?,"Our puppy Dachshund had an Ovarihysterectomy performed on Monday (she was spayed). She has a small (approximately 2 inch) sutured scar on her belly. She was given a cone to wear and we were asked to keep it on for two weeks(!).    While the cone (technically) fits, it's actually too heavy for her. She has trouble walking, because in order to do so, she has to keep her head up high and it's stressing her neck. Also, being a hound, she is used to walking with her nose to the ground, which is now impossible.  Would it really be necessary to keep it on her for a full two weeks? I don't dare let her bite at her belly, not yet anyway, because she'd probably open the wound, but how long should it take for the major portion of the scar to close? "
863,Creepy: The cat left a half eaten rabbit in the garden,"Creepy warning, this question is not for the light-hearted   This morning I was making breakfast while I spotted our cat eating something in the garden. A better look showed he caught a rabbit.   The cat is now very happy and satisfied, leaving me concerned about a half eaten rabbit in the garden.   Any chances that he will return and finish the meal?  What should I do? I'd prefer my partner not to see the horror scene in our garden when she gets back from work this evening.  Should I remove the half animal? how can I dispose of it? thanks "
864,How to tell a female Corn snake and a male Corn snake?,"How to tell a female Corn snake and a male Corn snake? I am thinking about mating my male Corn snake with a female Corn snake. My problem isn't the mating. My problem is how to tell the difference between a female Corn snake and a male Corn snake. If there is no way I can tell between the two Corn snakes directly, is there a way to tell by behavior? "
865,Serious flea problems with my dog,"History of the problem  I have a lot of problems getting rid of the fleas which torture my dog (A year and a half Yorkie :) ). First a brief history + info on what we have tried and what ware the results.  At first for the first time our dog got fleas after we groomed him (mid summer) before that he didn't had any. Once we groomed him in a few days he started scratching more than usual, after we checked him we saw a few on his back(following the length of the spine), not more than 10 ware spotted and that was it. We showered him with regular dog shampoo, used a ""spot on"" drops as a prevention measures and the problem seemed to be solved.  After a few days(not more than a week) we noticed that the little guy started scratching again and from time to time to bite his legs, when we examined we saw more than the previous time and we got flee repellent shampoo and spot on drops from a different brand, showered him thoroughly with the shampoo and used the drops again.   On the very next day he was scratching again and had the fleas again. This time we ware in for more serious measures, we got a spray and the ""protective night lamp thingy"" so he couldn't lick himself (advised by the instructions and by a staff member from pets at home). It worked for the night and the next day, that was it.   We sprayed him again, but after the result was the same we stopped (the spray is kind of dangerous and we don't want to cause the little fella more trouble)  After we got to the store again and this time we got these tablets and these drops. We gave him a bath with the same shampoo, gave hime the tablets and they took effect in about 20 minutes and we started seeing the evil creatures on the floor (which was expected result), used the drops and that was it, the effect was for about 10 days.  2 days ago we gave him a bath with the same shampoo and today when I got home I started petting him in his bed, and when he rolled on his back, I saw a very large group of the fleas running on his belly, when I started examining him, I saw that there are large fleas, like they ware there from a long time as well as smaller ones, around his nipples(?) I saw signs of wounds from either scratching or biting by those things.  Now the question   How should we approach the problem now? Can you recommend any other products, which helped you before?   Side info  We live in East London, UK. A large number of cats are passing trough the back yard(which is our first assumption for the cause of the problem), we treated the garden with animal repellent (to keep all kind of animals away) as well with some garden pest controlling product (It was supposed to kill the fleas(it was written on the label), don't remember any name, got it from the local pet store).   The dog is living in the house with us, no other pets. He goes in the garden when he wants, but mainly for 5-10 minutes and always sleeps inside. We walk him in the area (we avoid dog parks, ever since we spotted fleas on him).  Note:  I looked at this and this questions, but they don't seem to cover our situation. (I am considering the idea in the first question: mixing powder with warm water and spray him)   I do apologize, I know that the question is little too localized and might end up closed, but I am kind of desperate right now.   "
866,Is my Norwegian forest cat too heavy?,"I have a Norwegian forest cat. He is three years old; will be four in June. He just went for a vaccination/checkup and weighed in at 7.3 kg. The vet said he should be 6kg but they don't see a lot of Norwegian forest cats.   Is 7.3kg too heavy? He doesn't look fat under all that fur.   Also, should we be feeding him according to his activity? Some days he sleeps/rests most of the day and other days he wakes us up to play in the early morning/night.  "
867,What are some dos/don'ts for soothing a freaked out cat?,"Say a cat was freaked out by something. It could be a dream, a scary window critter, an unpleasant sound, or something unknown.  Given that the cat is now freaked out but the cause itself is gone or negligible, is there any way to let the cat know it need not be afraid anymore?  This is just speculation but might it be possible through behavior, sounds, or actions to facilitate a quicker recovery?  I have one cat who, when freaked out by who knows what, will come to whatever room I'm in, sit up in a compact manner (tail wrapped, legs close) and watch the door. My initial reaction would be to pet him but I feel that isn't actually going to help since he desires the high alert state for the time being (affection doesn't make you safer). What I then usually do is simply walk out of the room with him in tow trying to locate the source of the freakout. Often I am led from the rear to wherever he initially came from and I sort of just touch things and look around while talking to him quietly. After that he usually starts to poke around himself and moves on.  This got me thinking about other ways that this could be done or other things I could do. I think I'm doing a pretty good job with the above approach but any other information would be great. "
868,How would I get my dog down from our 3rd floor bedroom if there was a fire?,"Our dog sleeps with us in our 3rd floor bedroom, and though we have an escape ladder for people in case of fire downstairs, what is the best way to get a 60 pound dog to the ground safely? There's no way we could carry the dog down a rope escape ladder.  I've thought about using a rope through her harness to lower her to the ground, but I don't feel confident that her walking harness would stay on if she struggles while being lowered (and I'm certain she's going to struggle when we try to push her out an open window while the fire alarms are blaring and the room is filling with smoke).   Although she usually does sleep in her crate, I don't think it would fit through the window without folding it, or that it would stand up to being lowered by rope, so lowering her in her crate is probably not an option.  Is there a harness that would be secure, but is also quick and easy to put on in an emergency? Is there some better way to safely get a dog out a 3rd floor window and safely to the ground in an emergency?  "
869,Is it normal for a cat to eat moths?,My cat eats moths: is this normal or should it be discouraged?  I suspect it is not harmful but is there a formal answer? 
870,how to take care of community dog?,"scenario  I live in a college campus where stray animals are not hurt as compared to outside so even peacocks can be friendly. so there's no question of the dog biting me (I also pet only interested dogs.) also my hostel room is too small to keep the dog inside or in my sight. so I keep losing the dogs I petted or fed in the past as they wander quite a lot. although they recognise me and get very excited to see me as compared to others standing there. There's no vet inside the campus, but there are some groups working on vaccination and most of them are vaccinated.  Suggestions required on     how to bring them to my room on 1st floor.    Winter has come and it's like 8-9 degrees at night. I don't know where  do the dogs go at night. how can I bring them at my room at any time of the day and keep them as regular or permanent visitors? campus is huge and likewise, they also wander a lot and settle in the most beneficial location, which is not always in my comfort zone      should I feel bad about separating a pup from the parents?   As far as I have seen, female dogs normally belong to outside Campus and leave after breeding and I have never seen a family together. also males just live together for a few months and then babies live on their own. So is there a sentimental perspective I should take care of? "
871,Growing black stain in a dog's lower eyelid,"Background  I have a 2.5 years old male, mixed breed dog. We believe his ancestry is mainly cocker spaniel, with a fair amount of poodle and maybe some other thing.  He is in general good health, he is quite obedient, he runs a lot (he runs off-leash by the bike every day) and he is a happy dog. His eyes has always been the source of slight concern though. A year ago, in the mornings, he sometimes had mild red eyes that seems to be a bit itchy. Both eyes were typically of similar concern. It seems to have been mainly resolved now. One time, very early, when he was only 9 weeks, he got a weird eye infection, during which the left eye was red and quite severely swollen (I posted this when this issue happened). He typically have a little bit of dry eye crap in the morning but it is not much to other dogs I've seen.  Question  Here is a picture of my dog's left eye today    In the corner of his eye, on the lower eyelid, he has a black stain. It seems to my partner and I that this black stain has been growing throughout his life time. I am not aware of a family history of cancer or anything like that but I don't know his parents very well.  Is this black stain is of medical concern or is it just a harmless patch of melanin? Should I bring the dog to a vet? "
872,Can Bettas have lazy personalities?,"I had a betta a few years ago who was the most active, happy fish I've ever seen. He enjoyed hide-and-seek, watched me work at my desk, and constantly swam around his 5 gallon tank. He was a strong swimmer, a big eater, and lived a relatively good, long life.   A few months ago, I decided to pick up betta-keeping again, expecting similar results. I re-did all my research again to make sure I gave him the best environment, but he's a weak, lethargic little dude. I don't know if I've done something wrong, or if he's old, it's his personality... you name it.   Here's Odahviing's tank specs:    5 gal, carbon filtered tank (I have to turn the filter way, way down, because he has a hard time swimming in any sort of current, so the filter is more of a dribble).  Heat maintained around 76-78 F Decor: 2 moss balls, 1 zebra plant and 1 madagascar lace plant (my plants thrive and I make sure to remove spent leaves), 1 fake log, black sand bottom.  25-50% water change every 2-3 weeks, treated with conditioner. I test pH, ammonia, nitrite, nitrate, etc. levels generally each change. All are appropriate, except ammonia is slightly higher than 0 (just barely).  Fed betta pellets 2x/day, 3 in the am, 2 in the pm.    About a month ago, I moved him to my desk, where I spend a lot of my time when I'm home. He seemed to get a little more chipper, being closer to the action, but only a little bit. He spends more and more of his time lying still in the plant leaves, since they're big enough to support him, or sitting at the bottom of the tank. He does occasionally take a lap or two around the tank, and still enjoys chasing falling food pellets (he prefers chasing them to the bottom than to eating them at the top). He does eat less now, and much slower.   Maybe I'm a paranoid fish owner, but I'm always worried he's sick and/or dying. Any advice on why my fish is so slow, weak, and lethargic? Is he just really lazy?  "
873,Do I need to re-vaccinate my dog for rabies after possible exposure to an infected animal?,"I brought a traumatized little pup who had been bitten by an aggressive dog, seven days ago. The aggressive dog died, convulsing, the day after biting. The dog didn't show lack of coordination, jaw paralysis or salivation, though. Some people of the locality say he was killed by people due to aggressiveness, when he was hit on the head and he suffered a concussion. But no one will ever know what killed the dog actually.  The pup is receiving rabies post exposure prophylaxis. She is on day 5 and is quite active and healthy as of now. Her mother was never vaccinated so no maternal rabies antibody in her.  Now, we have an adult dog in our home. He is vaccinated every year for rabies. His rabies vaccination is due in March. He plays with the pup and licks her. Do we need to re-vaccinate the adult dog right now, or will he be protected adequately?  I asked three vets. One said we need to administer full 5 course post exposure prophylaxis to the adult dog. But two other said we need not administer anything. I am confused. Could you please help? "
874,Is it OK for cats to eat centipedes?,"My cat keeps eating centipedes! He was rescued on the street and remains an outdoor cat and occasional hunter. Indoors I've seen him eat centipedes more than once and each time I wonder if I should intervene or how much I should worry about it.   I keep an eye on him afterwards and both times I've seen it, he acts normal...though each time he seems to have a little hard time chewing it up, seemingly swallowing it ASAP instead!  Aren't centipedes poisonous? Looks like these kinds: [website]"
875,Bubbles on top of fish aquarium,I have 4 small fish in my aquarium (two Zebra Danios and 2 others which are a similar size but I don't know what they are). Every few days a lot of small bubbles appear at the top of the aquarium. When removed they reappear within 2 days.  The aquarium is a 15-20 litre one. It is cleaned every few months and has no filter. They are usually fed the right amount.  The bubbles were there for a few days and a thin dark layer formed on top:    A photo from the bottom view of the tank:    The water below is clean.   Is this harming the fish? What can be done to prevent this?  Any help is appreciated. 
876,Picking a puppy when the dog mom is aggressive,"We were trying to pick out a border collie puppy and met the puppies’ mom. She looked fearful, gave us the death stare, barked, and snapped at us and was extremely distrustful. Her behavior was a bit erratical, after a couple of minutes at some point she was comfortable enough to lie down show her belly, but then while treating her, she snapped again. Maybe we made a sudden movement she didn’t like? The puppies are 3 weeks old. We are not sure if this is just maternal aggression or the personality of the dog. In any case, we are a bit worried that the new puppies will take on this personality, I.e fearful/aggression towards strangers. The breeder commented that the dog has made a huge travel in the last months, and she might be stressed out and hasn’t adjusted well. But it also sounded like she doesn’t do that well with strangers. We need some advice! Do you think it’s still a good idea to get one of the puppies if the puppy mother shows this much aggression?  "
877,Pet sitting best practice,"This is my first time hiring a pet sitter for my cat. I found her on Rover with good reviews. Is there anything I should be aware of, since I will be giving her my house keys? Should I get her ID just in case? "
878,Newly adopted cat won't eat,I just adopted an adult cat three days ago from a shelter. They didn't know how old she was because she came in as a stray. If I had to guess she is 3-5 years old.  When we offer her food she won't eat it. We have tried a few kinds of wet food but in the last three days she has eaten maybe a total of one can of food. When we open a can she will run up and take two bites then so purring and walk away. She won't even eat treats or lunch meat. She has also thrown up twice but both times seem to have been in reaction to beef.  Do I just need to keep trying different kinds of food for her? Is this just a nervous reaction to a new environment? (She seems pretty calm and happy). At what point should I be worried? 
879,How far will my cat wander?,"We live on a large piece of property with a long driveway, (100 yards) and the yard is fenced but the cat could easily get out if it wanted to. The driveway leads to a highway, and while I haven't seen my cat ever wander more than 40 yards from the house, I'm curious to know whether or not it may want to. Specifically, will a female cat wander away from it's home for any common reason? Is it likely that she will stay somewhat close to the house, within the fense, and not wander off to the highway 150 yards away?  In other words, do cats have standard behavior in terms of how far they wander, or is it just random? "
880,Is it normal that my cat licks my clothes?,My cat likes (specially in the mornings) to lie in my chest while I'm reading or looking something in my laptop and then he starts to purr and to lick my clothes. He does it with as much passion as when he eats his favourite food.  He does this very often and I don't understand why. He's the first pet I have and I have him just from very recently. Is this a normal behaviour of the cat?  I don't know if he used to do this with his previous owners or if it is normal. Why does he act this way? 
881,Identifying non-physical neglect in dogs by observation,"Let's say there is a dog that has shelter and food and water, physically very healthy, friendly towards people (at least some), physically not abused, but never receiving attention from a human beyond feeding (no walking, playing, socialization, no contact outside of feeding, etc.). Imagine, say, a dog locked in a room, yard, shed, that is given food and water and space to move around but nothing else. I actually have two questions:   Informally (or formally) does this qualify as abuse of some type? If so, what is it usually called? The term ""neglect"", in official channels, seems to connote physical neglect rather than not meeting the social and psychological needs of a dog (""that dog is neglected"" -> ""no it's not, it's got food and shelter and is in great shape""). The phrase ""emotional neglect"", fair or not, always seems to immediately trigger eye-rolling in discussions with folks who don't take the issue as seriously as I'd like. If so, what are the typical signs and behavioral patterns of a dog in a situation where they are physically treated well but never given serious attention? Can I identify these animals with long term observation? Are there definite red flags that indicate a very high likelihood that this is happening?  "
882,Does an adult dog need regular walks if it has a large yard to run in?,"Relatives of mine have had dogs for most of their lives.  They have been without a canine companion for a few years now and would like another, but they are in their upper 70s with the beginnings of mobility issues.  They have always taken their dogs for walks at least twice daily, but are concerned that this might become increasingly difficult over the next several years.  They also have a large, fenced yard with plenty of room for a dog to run.  Of course, a fenced yard does not provide the dog with the chance to ""get the news of the neighborhood"", so to speak.  (At least I've been told that this is basically what they're doing when they sniff at things when out on walks.)  They prefer medium-to-large dogs -- golden retrievers, collies, and similarly-sized dogs.  (Their dogs are rescues, not purebreds, so treat this as an approximation.)  Their dogs live inside the house and get plenty of ""people time""; they aren't kept in a yard or barn full-time.  If they got a dog they would get one, not two, and would adopt an adult, not a puppy.  How important are walks to a dog's physical and mental well-being?  Can a large yard meet a dog's needs? "
883,What's the best way to get a dog and a cat accustomed to living together?,"My boyfriend and I are planning on moving in together in the near future and I am curious as to the best way to get his dog and my cat accustomed to one another. My cat has never been around dogs except one time and he really freaked out. His hair stood on end and he tried to hide. My boyfriend's dog is very mellow and is already accustomed to living with cats so she's not really the problem.  Should I try separating the two for a bit? Or should we just put them in the house/apartment together and let them work things out on their own? I think my cat would adjust fairly quickly, but I don't really know. "

885,My dog has adenocarcinoma. Is a heating pad not good?,"My dog was diagnosed with adenocarcinoma. X-rays were done and showed cancer spread to lungs. He was given about 6 months to live at the time.  He's about 14 years old no and the original diagnosis was a little over 2 years ago!  He looks like a mess now. Mass keeps growing and it takes up a sizable portion of his insides. He's still relatively happy. Wags his tail, barks when he wants food. His mobility has gone down and he sleeps a lot more.  Sometimes when he rests, he'll lay up against a hard surface on his right side. I figured this gave him a little relief from the pressure of the mass.  I placed a small heating pad place on low in his dog bed. I put a double wrapped bath towel over it. I monitored the temp and turned it off after about an hour. He loved it!    But is that okay? Is it harmful to him?  "
886,Luxating patella in Chihuahua?,"Ever since my Chihuahua was a puppy, he constantly switches back legs when running. Some times, he runs on all fours. Other times, he will run on 3 legs, always keeping one back leg off the ground. When he does this, it is never the same leg, and some times he switches. He never shows any signs of discomfort or yelps that might indicate pain. We even took him to the vet when he was young and they checked his knees and they did not detect anything. They said smaller breed dogs may do this ""just because they can get away with it."" However, I was doing some reading today and came across this link on wikipedia about luxating patella. It states     Chihuahuas are also known for luxating patella, a genetic condition   that can occur in all dogs. In some dogs, the ridges forming the   patellar groove are not shaped correctly and a shallow groove is   created, causing the patella to luxate or slip out of place, sideways.   The knee cap sliding across the bony ridges of the femur can cause   some pain. The affected chihuahua will hold its leg flexed, and foot   off the ground until the quadriceps muscle relaxes and lengthens,   after which the animal feels no discomfort and continues with   activity.   Emphasis my own. This seems to describe what occurs. But he doesn't have any issue walking, and like I mentioned no indication of pain. Did my vet know what he was talking about? Or should I be concerned? "

889,Dog threw up white foam,"My dog threw up white foam.  This isn't the first time and it doesn't happen often, but she has thrown up this white foam before.  I assume she sometimes swallows parts of her toys because she tears them to shreds.  She always eats normally, the same amount each day and doesn't act as if she is sick.  Is this just normal behavior for a dog to sometimes throw up white foam or is there possible a more serious issue that I should be concerned about, such as a bad bacteria, worms, etc.? Is my dog trying to tell me something by throwing up???  Note: she has done this since I've had her (4 years old now) and she visited the vet in the past year for a check up with nothing wrong.    Update: I took my dog to the vet yesterday bc I noticed blood in her poop (about 2 weeks after this post) and it turns out she had some type of stomach virus.  It cost about $180 for the vet visit and medications, but they gave her some antibiotic shots and some pills that I have to give her. So for the record: blood in poop = bad. "
890,Clicker training -- to pause or not to pause?,"I am reading ""Fired up, frantic and freaked out"" by Laura VanArdendonk Baugh.  On page 23 she describes the clicking process as the following steps:   Click Pause Move the treat hand Deliver   So what's with this ""pause"" step?   I've been doing clicker training for a while now (and I think it's working) but I am doing it on the premise that I have to deliver the treat within 3 seconds of the click in order for the dog to make the connection. And the sooner the better so: better deliver the treat immediately after the click (that's probably within one second).  My question is:     Are there any clicker training experts or preferably someone with an   animal behaviourist degree out there who can tell me if this pause   step in the book is a typo?   "
891,Cat stubbornly keeps repeating behaviour she's not supposed to do (and knows),"I have a set of furniture for my tv and dvds that my cat recently has discovered as something fun to climb on. For that she needs to start from the window-frame, jump behind the curtain and get on a closet.  I don't want her to climb on it, because she could cause damage by chewing, or throwing dvds on the ground, damaging the boxes and scratching the dvds.  I make it very clear that she's not allowed to climb the furniture set, by firmly saying 'no!' (and body language) and grabbing her by the neck and taking her off the furniture, if she persists. This usually works, as shouting or standing up from the couch normally makes her turn back. But sometimes she just rushes forward to reach as much as she can, before I have time to react.  The question  Is this just cats being cats, or might this be a sign of boredom? What can I do to get a more permanent solution?  PS: Sort of funny, she resets the clock above the furniture, by moving the big hand (she has to stand on dvds and stretch real high to do that). "
892,Why do people have pets?,"As a skeptic and someone that never had a pet, all I see in pets are creatures that are very needy and you have to look after, take care when sick, sometimes with expensive procedures, and are a burden if you have to stay away for any time longer than a few hours.   That said, the furthest to a conclusion I reached for the answer to ""why people have pets?"" is that pets, mostly dogs, somewhat resemble the reaction that people that love or care about you have with you, although that's arguably instinctive. For example: a Dog seems happy when he see the owner, just like a girlfriend or family member does. And that is usually taken by people as a reason to bound. Other more simple explanation is that pets are cute and we like to have them around.  So is there any scientific explanation to why people have pets? "
893,Is it possible and/or cruel to encourage a hamster to be more awake during the evening?,"We were considering a small pet for our family when, out of the blue, someone offered us a 6-month old Syrian hamster. The owner felt that their children weren't paying the pet enough attention, and was worried she (the hamster) might be bored and unstimulated due to lack of contact.  So we have an unexpected hamster. Her name is Luna.  We knew that hamsters were nocturnal, of course. But we just assumed that they slept for 8-10 hours through the middle of the day and would be awake at dawn and dusk. Luna seems to sleep an awful lot: she's asleep when we get up between 7-8am. Occasionally she half-wakes and grabs a snack, then sits in her nest with her eyes closed to eat it. She doesn't start to stir until 7pm and she's not properly awake until 8-9pm.  Our children are not that old, and they're both in bed before 9pm. So they don't get to see very much of Luna at all. My wife and I go to see her, give her some fresh food and water and some interaction before we go to bed. But that's not much stimulation for her. The kids are a bit sad they can't play with their new pet, and I'm worried she's going to lack attention with us as much as she did in her previous home.  We could wake her up, but it seems cruel. And we read somewhere that hamsters tend to bite if they're disturbed from their sleep.  It must be said that she doesn't seem bored. We've seen no evidence of repetitive behaviours and all the signs are she's very active at night - her cage is often trashed in the morning!  So, is it possible to encourage or train a hamster to have more periods of activity during the evening? And perhaps more importantly, if it is, is it cruel to do so? If it is ok, how should be we best go about it? Or do we have to accept she'll spend most of our time with us asleep? "
894,Add Fish or Corals first in a mixed reef setup,"I'm hoping there is more science to this than just opinion, because of reasons livestock can cause certain things like phosphates or alkalinity to rise and fall but... I would actually prefer some first hand experience on people's own experiences. When should I introduce my first frags? I'm assuming since water parameters will need to be more precise, then fish first? But then I wonder do fish have difficulty acclimating to introductions of certain corals and would they prefer different coral structures (species dependent?)  There might be a lot of content to cover here, I understand. I would really like an awesome reef setup with a good mix of hard and soft corals, but my wife loves fish. I'll add additional tank details below, but for right now where I'm at, my tank is finishing it's Nitrogen cycle (on a different posted question). There is currently nothing in the tank except for Maturing dry rock, sand, and saltwater  Additional tank info:  Size 75G  Rock 75lbs dried pukani from bulk reef supply  Sand 40lbs live sand  Temp 80F deg  Salinity 1.026 s.g., 35 ppt  Skimmer is currently not running during cycling  Lighting is currently off as well  Using RO/DI system with out water reading 0 tds (Mixed and heated in a storage container for all my water changes) "
895,Cat dropping food in her water,"This is one I haven't seen before: our cat (about 18 months old, rescued from the street before 6 months old) always wants to be sure there is food floating in her water bowl before she drinks from it. If the water is clear, then without fail she very intentionally switches to her food bowl, takes 3-4 pieces in her mouth, and goes back to her water bowl to drop them in. (She ignores this ritual with other water sources, such as the toilet when someone forgets to leave the lid down...)  The pieces of food gradually soak up water, deteriorate, and make it rather unappealling — from a human point of view. What's the appeal to her? To clarify, we're not concerned, just curious.  One hypothesis so far is that she just likes the taste of her food and wants to flavour her water. But I gather that taste doesn't play a huge role in a cat's diet. Another one is that she isn't sure about the water level and wants some ""buoys"" floating in it to better gauge it. If so, she's a pretty weird cat, considering they don't all do this!  What are your ideas? "
896,Does Darwin Raw Pet Food Have Metal In It?,"My wife and I are thinking about switching to a new (different) raw pet food diet for our dog.

897,My chartreux stopped eating canned food - Normal?,"My 16 year old chartreux mix recently stopped eating his canned (wet) food.   I've always given him 100-200 grams each day and always had a bowl of dry food ready for him. Recently, he stopped eating the canned food and sticks with the dry food. I tried changing it to like 10 different brands, organic food (very expensive), and self made food. He just licks off the sauce and takes no bites anymore. I am in no worries about his health as he otherwise seems perfectly fine and he still eats (more now) dry food and drinks normally.   Is it maybe just a change in a cat's life? I heard you can buy just the sauce for cats so they can lick it off and get the fats and nutrients they need. Maybe that's an idea? "

899,Best Residential Aquarium Test kits for accuracy versus affordability,"What are the the best testing strips out there for measuring PH, Ammonia, Nitrates, etc.? I would like to find something more accurate (currently using API test kits with droppers in 5 mL) It seems odd to me that the assumed accuracy and tight parameters that one needs to keep to maintain a mixed reef that API's kits are even suggested to anyone from the LFS. I would like to know if someone has better and more accurate results from other testing kits for their aquarium.  My setup is a mixed reef marine aquarium and eventually my next larger tank might be seeded with this 75G I have now. That aquarium will have controllers that will have top shelf controllers with industrial grade probes. I don't have that now. What I have is bottom of the barrel test kits though, monitoring my few thousands dollars worth investment. Again, does anyone know of a more accurate kit? "

904,Cat is acting strange,"My cat has been acting up recently and I don't know what to do. She's constantly following me around. She'll get up from her sleep and meow and run after me after she hears me coming. And there have been a few incidents which have worried me. She'll come at legs when she rubs against them, and she'll swat at me when I'm sitting across her. I can't just casually walk by her, I always have to crouch down and draw her attention away from my legs so she doesn't attack them. I feel like she's always watching me and I don't understand why. She's been watching me, meowing at me and following me around constantly. This was not normal before. I'm getting more and more scared of her. She's been seeking more of my attention lately.  Some info:  She sleeps on the floor instead of my bed now.  She no longer has an interest in running out the front door when someone comes in.  We brought in a carrier of another cat, could the smell of that cat be the cause for this behaviour?  We haven't been able to get her wet food in a week and she's constantly meowing for it. Could the lack of wet food be the cause?  Her behaviour has also changed quite a bit. We've had her for 3 months although she is 3 years old. Domestic short hair.  How do I get this behaviour to stop?  UPDATE: Ever since getting her wet food and removing the carrier, most strange behaviours have stopped. Thank you all for the responses! "
905,How do I crate train an adult dog?,"This question My dog is destroying things and peeing inside when I am at work. How can I get him to stop?  led me to ask this.  Some of the reasons to crate train a dog, as set out by the RSPCA Vic Australia:     Crate training is a new concept for many, but is a very effective training tool for adult dogs and puppies. It may take a little time and effort to train your dog to use the crate, but it can prove useful in a variety of situations. For instance, if you have a new dog or puppy, a crate is a fantastic way of teaching it the boundaries of the house and keeping it safe. When you’re travelling in the car, visiting the vet or any other time you may need to confine your dog (eg. after surgery or if it has been injured), it’s much easier and safer if your dog has been trained to enjoy being in a crate.   It's much easier to train a puppy to adapt to sleeping and staying in a crate.  How can an adult dog be crate trained? "
906,How can I train my rabbit to use the toilet?,"We know from What is required to house break a rabbit? that litter box training a rabbit is very similar to a cat. We know from How can I train my cat to use the toilet? that cats can be trained to use a toilet.   From personal experience I know that bunnies are not as comfortable with having their feet on slippery surfaces as a cat is, so some kind of no-slip seat would be required. I also know that they will readily jump up to chair or couch height, so it seems possible in theory.    Are there any documented cases of a bunny using a toilet?  Does anyone have first person experience in an attempt? "

If not, then what dangers are substantial enough to consider?  If yes, then how much and how often?  "
909,How can I best manage the drooling from my sick cat?,"My cat is 15 now and was diagnosed with squamous cell carcinoma and it seems she may be on the last of her lives.  While my family is very saddened about this news and didn't know about the risk factors early on in her life, we now have to just take care of her as best we can.   Unfortunately for my parents, who keep her in the house, she drools almost constantly because of the ailment in her mouth. This has resulted in having to constantly wipe her mouth; her legs become dirty from the saliva mixed with food, and the furniture and floors get dirty as well.  While this may seem petty to worry about, my parents have to do a lot of extra work cleaning up everything, and it is sad to see her unable to control it.   We try to feed her soft, cold foods, clean her regularly, and give her Life Gold (this is not a plug for the product but it does seem to be helping), but the problem of her drooling still remains.  Is there anything we can do to help stop this? "
910,What plants and animals can naturally oxygenate a fish pond?,"I have three freshwater fish pond pots. I do not have a man-made filtration system and the fish are doing well. ""How do I balance surface area and volume in my outdoor fish pond?"" asks about atmospheric oxygenation with respect to the available surface area of water.  Which plants or animals can I add to help naturally oxygenate the fish ponds?  I am not interested in the pros and cons of natural vs man-made filtration / oxygenation. "
911,Which snails can I use to just eat algae?,"I'm trying to optimize my ponds through natural means.  Per ""Would my fish benefit from snails in their pot pond?"", I understand that my fish would benefit from snails, but I don't know which species of snails to acquire.  Which snails should I get to focus on consuming the algae and not the plants?  Are there snails that I can use to do this? "
912,How can I make two chicken mothers eat peacefully?,"Two of my chickens just hatched their eggs and I noticed since then that whenever I call them to give all of them food, two of the chicken mothers start fighting for where to eat.  I didn't worry until now because I usually notice this whenever two of my chickens hatch their eggs around the same period. I solved this problem by spreading the food, the chicken mothers will then go to two locations and stop fighting.  However, doing that still doesn't solve the problem of these two. No matter how far I spread the food, they will fight to eat at the same spot.   What is the cause of their fight?  How can I stop it and make them eat peacefully?  "
913,Why do dogs turn around in a circle before lying down?,"I have observed over and over again in dogs (mine and others) that they will often walk around in a little circle, on the spot, where they are about to lie down. It's like they need to rotate a certain number of times before it's ok to lie down and curl up in a ball.  I have also noticed that they will only tend to do this, if they are going to curl up in a ball to sleep.  Why do dogs often turn around in a circle before lying down?  And is it connected to them wanting to sleep curled up? "
914,How should I schedule application of flea preventative against bathing?,I apply a flea / tick / mosquito preventative (SimpleGuard) to the back of my dog on the first of every month.  I have to assume bathing my dog will affect the effectiveness of any applied preventative.  I have also been informed that applying preventative should not be done soon after a bath.  This leads me to 2 related scheduling questions:   How soon after application can I bathe the dog without reducing the effectiveness of the preventative? How long after a bath should I wait before applying the preventative?  
915,Why do dogs not appear to be comfortable walking with socks on?,"There are YouTube videos of dogs walking with socks on, in which the dogs are clearly uncomfortable with walking while wearing socks. Why is that?  Sample YouTube video for reference. "
916,Why all the safety concerns regarding topical flea products?,"I don't use topical flea products on my cats or dogs.  I worry about using a pesticide that is absorbed systemically. This is just my own personal concerns and not intended to alarm people.  I was looking for a reference to answer ""How should I schedule application of flea preventative against bathing?"" and got sidetracked after discovering negative search results warning about topical applications. The results just reinforced my concerns, but maybe I'm just a bit too worried. It is also difficult to know if I can trust everything I read, as I am not sure the search results will be reputable.  Are topical flea products safe for dogs and cats? "
917,Do smaller numbers of goldfish form pairs?,"I've been asking a lot of questions about goldfish, as I am preparing for a bigger pond.  I currently have three comets that I will move to  the bigger pond. The pond will be approx 350 L so there will be ample room for them. When the three fish were together, the smallest one was being pushed out of the way at feeding time, now this could be due to them needing more room. Since I moved the largest fish to his own pond, this has stopped.  I am wondering, with small numbers of goldfish, is it better to have an even number to reduce bullying or does it make no difference? I am wondering if they form friendship pairs? (I am not referring to mating pairs, as I have no idea what sex these fish are, but if there is information abut mating pairs, this is also a good thing). "
918,What are the problems associated with my cat eating paper?,"My cat has recently started chewing on paper products I leave around the house. I try to keep him away from the paper stuff, but, well, I can't be everywhere always.  I figure since paper isn't cat food, he shouldn't be eating it, but just how worried should I be? What are the dangers of him eating paper? "
919,How can I help my colleague train her dog to behave in the workplace?,"I work in a small office of eight people, one of whom bought a Cockapoo puppy a year ago. In the main it's a great set-up (for Twiglet and us), but recently we've been having some problems that we're finding difficult to solve, made worse by some people in the office not being 'dog people'.  Twiglet's a sweet dog, quite small, with a wonderful attitude towards people and other dogs. He's not hyper but he has a lot of energy which he uses up playing and running in the park next door to our offices, which various people from the company walk him in throughout the day. When he's in the office someone will often sit and play with him for a while, hiding treats or toys and getting him to find them, teaching him tricks, etc. I know that problems of understimulation are associated with having dogs in a work environment, but I really think he's doing okay on that front.  THE PROBLEMS  Most people in the office love having him around and interacting with him but recently he's been displaying two behaviours more and more: jumping up for attention and unbearable whining when either his owner, Jacky, or a man called Ed to whom he has developed an inexplicable attachment, leaves the room even to go to the toilet.  PROBLEM #1  I think I understand the causes of the first problem: some people love him jumping up and encourage it by hugging and petting him. We have made it clear in the office that it is not to be allowed, and in the main he has been getting better. But there is one woman, who is NOT a dog person at all, who just doesn't get it, and who, by pushing him down quite strongly whenever he jumps up, makes it much worse by exciting him. I just can't get through to her politely what she must do in order to get him to stop. She just can't help it: she's quite well strung. I sympathise but I just don't know what to do. If she can't join in with the rest of us in not rewarding him with attention when he jumps up, I don't things are going to change. In the meantime this lady and the rest of us are very tense and nervous, as she can't sense him coming and he gives her a terrible fright. She is quite elderly, perhaps not in years (I think she's less than seventy) but a little frail.  PROBLEM #2   Despite being happy in the office and being great friends with the rest of us, Twiglet only really has eyes for Jacky (owner) and Ed (friend). Whenever one of them shows signs of leaving the room, as indeed they have to, often at the same time, for work reasons, or just to go to the toilet, Twiglet goes a bit mad. He whines, often developing into barks, runs around the office, looking out of windows... it's a bit hard to deal with. What should we do when this happens? Should we try to ignore him? Usually we sit with him and try to calm him down by stroking him, or getting him to do tricks like Paw or Lie Down, which distracts him slightly. But I worry that this is rewarding the behaviour with attention. However, is it behaviour that is the problem, or an emotional state? ANY advice on this would be very helpful.  QUESTIONS IN BRIEF   How to deal with the following situation: training a dog not to jump up at people while they're working when one of those people doesn't understand or appreciate the importance of ignoring the dog. She simply reacts quickly and to an extent violently by pushing him down, which gets him excited and leads to more jumping. Very tense situation all round. How to deal with a dog that whines unbearably when his owner or a friend whom he has an attachment with leaves the office. Should we give him attention? Ignore him? Is there anything else we could do?  "
920,When is it safe to add fish?,"I have a 50-gallon wide tank and all associated materials.  On November 1st, my tank had tap water chemistry (meaning 0 ammonia, 0 everything); I had just set up my tank.  I added Stress Zyme by API and stress coat to dechlorinate and dechloramine the water.  It also added beneficial bacteria - I have driftwood, slate, and moss in my tank.  I have marbles on top of my gravel.  At two weeks after set-up (Nov. 14) and adding 30 drops of ammonium chloride weekly, the tank has 0.5 ppm ammonia, no nitrites, and 40ppm nitrate.  Is my tank done cycling?  Should I add more ammonia? I added a rotala plant two days ago. "
921,Will my pet get sick drinking from the toilet?,"Many houses have a room with a large white bowl that is regularly refilled with fresh water.  The door is open unless the room is occupied.  The bowl holds much more water than any water dish.  Unlike the water dish, the bowl is refilled several times a day with cool water.  If you are a big dog or an agile cat, what is not to like about this fancy porcelain bowl?  From the pet perspective, a toilet bowl has a lot to offer for drinking water options.  Given the places their tongues go and the things they eat, the toilet is not as dirty a place as a person might imagine.  Assuming a toilet has water coming from a fresh water supply (without additives) and the bowl is cleaned regularly, is it safe for a pet to drink from the toilet?  Are there any studies or research linking drinking water from the toilet bowl to health issues in pets?   "
922,What breeds of dog are known for handling separation anxiety well?,"My wife and I are looking for a dog, preferably a larger breed of dog such as a Siberian Husky or German Shepherd. The problem that I am having with the situation is that my wife and I both live an hour away from work. That means we are both away from home 10 hours a day and work the same schedule.   Is there a breed of dog that would be okay with this type of separation? My wife is not convinced that it would be a bad idea for a dog; however, I am thinking that a dog just would not fit our work schedule.  I am hoping my question is not too opinion-based or too broad, so my question breaks down to whether factual information exists regarding which dog breeds better handle being alone for long periods of time.  Also, is separation anxiety gender-related? "
923,How can I resolve a fish conflict in my aquarium?,"I want to have bettas in my 50-gallon tank, which will consist of schools of fish.  Suppose I obtain a group of (maybe 4) female bettas and I have a shoal of 10 neon tetras in a 50-gallon tank. There are about 8 places for the fish to hide.  Would they end up being compatible?  Suppose some of the tetras begin nipping one or a few of the bettas' fins?  How should I resolve the situation?  Would I have to get a new tank, which isn't an option, or would I release it back to a pond?  What should I do?  Can someone answer this from experience?  "
924,Why does my European pond turtle rest on the back of my red-eared slider?,"I have a European pond turtle and a red-eared slider as pets. They had been living together in harmony in an aquarium for about 8 years, but when I moved them both to a larger aquarium a year ago, I started noticing something weird.  Every now and then, the pond turtle (which is about half the size of the red-eared) would climb on the back of the red-eared slider and stay there. The red-eared doesn't seem to like it and tries to remove the pond turtle from its back, but the smaller pond turtle manages to stay there.  Is this normal behavior, or could it be harmful for the red-eared slider?  Should they co-exist in the same aquarium? "
925,What are the risks associated with keeping woodlice at home?,"I have started collecting woodlice in the garden and putting them in plastic boxes (with small holes, ~ 1 mm wide) with rotten leaves, pieces of apple and earth. What are the risks associated with keeping them in the house? Could they or their offspring escape and start an infestation in my house? Do they carry diseases? "
926,Should I consider a Maltese or English Bulldog with children (ages 3-11 years)?,"I have smaller brothers. One have 3 years, another have 5, another 7 and another have 11 years.  What dog is better for these children? Maltese or english bulldog?  I have a small house, without garden!!! "
927,"What to feed an underweight, heavily pregnant young horse?","We're getting our girl at end of next week, at which time she will be 8.5 months pregnant. She's a 3yo standardbred 14 3hh.  She's currently on oaten hay - there's no grazing. I'll be moving her to an acreage with plenty of grass - there will be 3 other horses, I'll close off a gate, they'll have 10 acres at a time.  I'm hearing mixed things, so not sure what to start her on. Apparently she hasn't lost or put on weight since this pic 12 days ago. In this pic she is 8 months pregnant.    I had been intending to start her small amounts of biomare and slowly increase it. I've found out it contains grains, which are not particularly helpful and want to make up a diet for her.   Also Australian pasture is high in iron and our horses, generally, need supplementation in Copper and zinc.  I'm also going to worm ALL the horses with a equimec plus tape. The farrier will come and trim them all. I'll get the vet to check her teeth, the dentist won't be around for 6 months.  Should I give her hay as well?  The vet will visit her asap after she arrives.  Thoughts?  I've learnt a few lessons since Cleo came to join us and want to make this filly and her baby's health and chances optimal. "
928,Covered cat litter box with space?,"I have a regular covered litter box that my cats use. But I've noticed that they always poop where the entrance is, and that makes sense. Who wants to walk on poopy sand?  Are there any covered litter boxes that have space around the litter? So they can walk around the litter box and poop/pee wherever they want. And it's still covered.  In other words, instead of entering the litter box and being on top of the sand, it would be like a small bathroom: they go into the litter box, and then they can walk around to see where they can poop/pee.  Thanks. "
929,Best way to interrupt a cockatiel's brooding,"I am preparing for an international move with my cockatiel.  The bird started brooding and laying eggs about two weeks before the travel date.  It is a 5 year old bird and it is the first time this happens.  Right now she sits on her (infertile) eggs all day long and only comes out of the nest box about twice a day, and only for a short period of time which she spends eating ferociously.  While in the box, she is aggressive.  Because of the travel I must interrupt her brooding somehow.  What is the best way to do this?  The only thing I could think of: I can simply move her to a different cage when she comes out, and never let her back to her eggs. I do not know if the shock this would cause is harmful. I tried taking her to another room when she came out to eat last time. After a few minutes she got very nervous and chirpy, and wanted to go straight back to the box.  Eventually I do need to move her into a different cage for travel ...  Is there a more gentle way to deal with the situation? "
930,Can I treat a kitten with medicine (Amoxicillin) that I already have at home?,"Can I use amoxicillin to treat a kitten who is approximately 10 weeks old?  He appears to be congested, maybe has a sinus infection.  If it's OK to do this:   What is the dosage? How often can I give it to him? What is the length of time I should be giving it to him?   I do not have money for a Vet, so taking him there is not an option for me.  "
931,"My cat is not eating, will he starve to death?",I have older cat that is suffering from chronic renal failure. He is refusing to eat and growing thin and weak. Will he just starve to death? Is that the way a cat with this illness dies? 
932,What can I do for a stray cat having an eye infection,"Last week I found a neighborhood stray cat (he often comes in my yard) is having an eye infection.  His right eye appears to be half closed and abnormal with white eye discharge.  His left eye looks fine.  I am willing to take him to the vet if I can, but it's difficult because he is not so friendly to human and not approachable.  Actually I've been trying to tame and touch him for a year without any success.  I've been observing him for these few days hoping it will be cured naturally, while I think I should do something reasonable.  What are the possible options?  I have some my antibiotics leftover (still in good condition); is it good idea to let him take small amount of it with some food? "
933,Where do puppy teeth go when they drop?,"As a small human, losing a tooth was a bit of an adventure. While I kinda took it for granted, I realised, about 13 years down the road that I'd never actually seen my dog's teeth when they dropped (well, we did get given a bag of teeth when he had a bunch extracted, but that's what inspired it).  So if they drop where do they go? I assume if they get swallowed they ought to come out the other end (but I've never seen that), or is there a difference between human and canid tooth replacement? "
934,Can I rename a dog I get from a shelter?,"I’m looking into adopting an adult dog from a shelter. As I’m looking through some of the ones available, I’m not always thrilled with the names they are given.  Is it possible to rename a dog so that they respond to a new name? And if so, is that an okay thing to do with the dog, or is it better for the dog’s well-being if they continue to be called by their original name? "
935,What do I do with my dead fish?,"I came home earlier to find that my fish had died. I wasn't expecting this to happen as he was supposed to live for a really long time. So this is a situation that wasn't thought about much. I do not want to bury him, flush him down the toilet, cremate him or give him to animals to eat. Are there any other options? At the moment he is still floating in my tank so please help. Is there even a way of keeping him in a hygienic way? Thanks "
936,Why doesn't my kitten hunt like others?,"My kitten doesn't hunt at all. It just keeps lying lazily in the carton box and when it feels hungry, it meows and we feed her. Even when insects or rats go in front of it, she just looks at them and doesn't even try to catch them.  Is this behavior normal?   How do I teach her to hunt? "
937,Yellow Hawaiian Tang Bullying and Killing Everything in the Tank!,"A little info about my tank, I have various soft reef, beginner reefs. The tank is 55 gallons in size. A couple months ago I bought a Yellow Tang. Upon purchase the Tang was an adolescent. I also bought a Coral Beauty the same day. In the tank at the time, there were around 30 snails and 20 hermit crabs, along with 3 or 4 Emerald crabs; a Scooter Blenny. The Tang and Coral Beauty fought over territory and ended up becoming friends within the first week. The Coral Beauty died weeks later by somehow swimming into the power jet.   Present day - the Tang and the Blenny still remain. They get along. I have attempted introducing several fish, 2 Lawnmower Blennys and a Six Line Wrasse. The Yellow Tang has killed every new fish I have introduced in the tank. I have also caught him killing snails and eating hermit crabs after pulling them out of the shell. There are some peppermint shrimp on the list too.   I feed the Tang once, mid-day. There is plenty of fresh algae for him to eat in the tank, also. Most is grown in my refugium. Is there anything I can do to prevent the Tang from killing new fish I put in my tank? Is there something specific causing this? Is he just a jerk?!? "
938,How do I keep ferrets out of my aviary?,"Is there a wire or something else that can be used to stop ferrets getting into aviaries? One ate my mum's owl over the weekend, and I want to keep them out so no one else gets eaten. (It could have also been a large rat.)  How can I keep the birds in my aviary safe? "
939,Neutering a kitten at 9month age ?,"We have a male 9 month old 'Turkish Angora' kitten. He is very aggressive, yowling all day, doesn't want anyone to be closer to him, when anyone goes closer to him or touch him he leaves the place where he is sitting. We visited vet and another person told us that this can be fixed by neutering as there is no female cat in our house. Is neutering the right choice ? Is it the right time ? We are really annoyed by his yowling.  "
940,How can I know how healthy my turtle's shell is?,"Recently while giving my turtle some shell scratching I noticed I could press the plastron (bottom part of shell) and carapace (top part of shell) down closer to each other. This mostly only happens at the extremities of the shell near the head and tail, but it got me worried about whether my turtle's shell is healthy and whether this should be happening.   My turtle has about 6 hours of partial Sunlight exposure through the day with accessible basking spots. I feed it daily, a diet of mixed pellets, worms, chicken, shrimp, and the veggies I have though it doesn't eat much of that. The pellets I use all have calcium, and I do leave cuttlebone floating around in the water, though I'm not sure the turtle shows interest. I also made it some food which is basically mixed pellets with chicken and some veggies, as well as crushed cuttlebone. The turtle is about 3-3.2 inches in shell length and has no signs of pyramiding.   Is the mobility of the plastron and carapace at the extremities something adverse for the shell? What are some ways I could know whether my turtle's shell is healthy?  "
941,What are the Pros and Cons to feeding my Corn Snake filtered/bottled water rather than tap water?,"I was just told today to NEVER feed my Corn snake tap water. But I can't really afford to supply bottled/filtered water for him and it's slightly inconvenient. I know that it can cause a build up of bacteria in a young corn snakes intestine, possibly leading to digestive problems later in life and a pre-mature death, but how likely is that? If the fluoride, chlorine and chemicals are not concentrated enough that it doesn't make human's drop dead, then how bad can it be? "
942,Is distilled or spring water better for fish tanks?,"A recent answer suggested that if your home water supply was not used for filling a fish tank, that 'spring water (not purified water)' was preferred over distilled water.   What advantages would one offer over the other? What should I consider when choosing bottled water for my fish tank? "
943,How to clean (disinfect) my dog everyday after walk?,"To give you some perspective, my dog and I go for a walk, every morning (~ 45 min) and evening (~ 30 min).  We don't have any grounds nearby (only fields (1)) which means I have to walk him on streets with shrubs and small plans along the sides. There are a number of stray dogs and many people walk their dogs along the same route too. What this means is that there's fresh urine on almost every other plant (2) and mine inevitably ends up with urine all over his body (3).  As you may know many dangerous diseases, e.g. Ebola, are introduced into the human population through close contact with the blood, secretions, organs or other bodily fluids of infected animals. This means that not only my dog, but also my entire family, especially me (4), could be in danger.  I have no idea how to clean him up after everyday walks without damaging/harming his coat and skin. Shampooing is not an option as it results in dry skin. (Bathing him with just water doesn't disinfect him. Will a towel bath with Dettol be good enough? Will it introduce any side effects? I don't know.)  So, what should I do? How do you do it?    Footnotes:   And I don't walk him in fields due to fear of snakes. Intact males and females which means they spray urine everywhere. My dog wants to pee on the same spot, and doesn't get it over with by simply raising his leg. He first puts his head into the plant for inspection, and them moves around, inside and out, before he finishes the job he so diligently performs every single time.  It's his only play time and he loves it the most. So I simply cannot be too restrictive, and even though I watch out for pee on plans, I inevitably miss one or he's too quick. I kiss him, pet him and play with him; and I want to be able to without fear of contracting a disease.  "
944,What are good foods for brine shrimp and how to administer them?,"In order to raise brine shrimp to adulthood, what sorts of food can I feed to the brine shrimp in the grow-out tank? What is the best way to administer them?  I have heard that yeast and egg yolks are both good sources of food but I wonder if there are others. I would also like to know the best way to administer these foods. "
945,At What Age/Weight Should NZW Rabbits be bred?,"Strangely, I keep reading radically different answers for when it is best to breed NZW Does.     Before breeding our does, they must be at least 5 to 6 months old and a minimum of 6 to 7 pounds. - [website]  You can begin breeding your rabbits when they are 4 to 4.5 months old (AZ Rabbits discourages [waiting any longer] as it can cause breeding problems). - [website]And I have seen others that specifically said even longer than 6 months and others that said shorter than 4 months for NWZ/standard meat breeds. So when is it safe (age/weight) and generally recommended to breed a young doe? What are the potential risks/drawbacks of an early (4-4.5 month) pregnancy? What are the risk/drawbacks of a latter pregnancy? "
946,"Pet Rabbits, Double Pregnacies, and Keeping the Buck in with the Doe","In my limited experience thus far, I have found that my rabbits get along well together and show every sign of enjoying each other's company. So I would very much like to keep my buck in with the pregnant doe until her time approaches. But I have just read about some issue that this can cause called double pregnancy. Apparently, rabbits can get pregnant twise and carry both to term at the same time, and this can cause serious issues for both batches.  How likely I this to happen and cause serious issues? Is their some alternative to bucks living mostly solitary lives? "
947,Neutering my dog,"Dog breed : Korean Jindo  Age : 2 years 6 months  Gender : Male  Status : Not neutered.              Never been mated.   Personality : Shy, very sensitive, timid, very soft-hearted   Walk : Twice a day for 1~2 hours.    He is not neutered. We are not sure about the neutering, but our concern is...is this okay for him?   In our circumstances it is hard to find a mate for him. We are afraid that mating him once can make him want even more...  The vet says as long as he is not in contact of female dogs, it's fine.   Is this true?   Will this affect his psychological and physical health?  (he'll not be in contact with other female dogs) "
948,Probiotics to attenuate FHV-1 flare ups,"I'm pretty certain my cat has had fhv-1 most his life, every few months he gets eye and nose boogers. It's generally mild and it will subside. I've had it recommended to me giving probiotics can help a little for the flare ups, via increasing immune function etc. Has anyone any experience with this or recommendations?   Roche makes a veterinary probiotic (live culture) for dogs and cats. It's expensive. Is there any home remedy versions of probiotic cultures safe to give?  "
949,Can unscented baby wipes be used instead of pet wipes to disinfect my dog?,"NOTE: This is a follow-up of and related to my previous question — How to clean (disinfect) my dog everyday after walk?  Baby wipes are used to dry bathe babies, a good way to bathe them without getting wet too often. In a way, it's an easy solution to cleaning babies.  Similarly, we have pet wipes for dogs (1). But can baby wipes be used to disinfect dogs? (2) i.e. as an alternative to pet wipes?  A baby gets dirty inside the house hence the risk is lower, where as a dog gets dirty outside, be it a park or streets, and it may involve other dogs' urine and other secretions—a common way for diseases to spread (sometimes even to us).  Given the case, the question is, will baby wipes work just as well in disinfecting my dog? If not, what are my alternatives, other than pet wipes (3)?    Footnotes:   Good pet wipes are hard to find in my place (even online), and hence this question. I am from India. Baby wipes can be harmful to dogs if they consume the solution from the wipes (through licking), esp. if one of the ingredients is Propylene Glycol. I can take care of this by getting unscented (free of fragrance) baby wipes and making sure that my dog gets dry before I let him out of my sight. E.g. Towel bathing with a 1 in 40 solution of Dettol and water (i.e. 1 tablespoon of Dettol in 500 ml of water). The thing is I am not sure if it'd cause any skin irritation in dogs, or if it'd be effective at all.  "
950,How can we help dog with failing vision?,Our border collie is getting old. Her eyes are beginning to fail and there are clear signs of cataracts.  She seems to sometimes feel stressed when she encounters stripes of contrasting colours. Crossing a bridge in bright sunlight when the sun is shining through the side of the bridge casting sharp shadows causing clear stripes on the bridge surface seems to freak her out. She will not walk across the bridge without pressure.  I noticed this too on the house stairs recently - she was standing on the landing clearly stressed and scared to venture further down the stairs. Our stairs are painted white at the sides but have bare wood in the middle so again dramatic contrast.  We have been planning to repaint the stairs - is there a colour scheme that may help her? Are there colours that will help her discern the steps as her vision fades? 
951,What is this wound on my dog's leg? Help me please,"Weeks ago the leg of my 5 years old boxer  was very swollen and he even walked a little limp, time later a kind of wound was formed and until today it has not been removed.   Thought my dog does not complain about anything, does not cry, or anything, keeps eating well, runs without any problem now, and everything normal. Although from time to time I've noticed that he licks his leg.  What could it be? Is it a disease? Could it be dangerous, contagious, ... ?  Should I take him to the vet?  Or will it heal with the passage of time?  Thank you in advance for your help.  Here is the picture (apologies if it looks really bad)         Update  I know you have mention in the answers to take my dog to the veterinarian and I do really want to take him asap but vet is on vacations and won't be here until January. So please tell me what can I do to help my dog for now? Should I bandage his leg? Something else?   I took him other photos recently. Does it looks better? Please help me  2nd update  I luckily could contact the current vet and told me it is a skin fungal infection. And vet recommended a cream.                 "
952,Will my runaway cat come out when he gets hungry enough,"I moved apartments with my 2 year old cat. And after 3 days he got outdoors and went exploring. And suddenly disappeared.  I've searched and called up and down the streets, put flyers, contacted local vets and all the neighbours. I've searched as many of their houses as I could. I've looked into any nook or cranny that I can imagine a cat hiding in.  Its now been 3 days without a sign of him.  I've read that cats that are displaced will usually hide and not respond to calls or come out.   Question   Will he come out when he's hungry / desperate enough?  Will his survival instinct kick in and force him out? I will keep searching for weeks if I have hope to find him.  What else can I try to find him?  Thank you "
953,"Dogsitting: 2-year-old dog refuses to pee outside, then deliberately pees inside","I dogsit sometimes and just took on a new client yesterday. She's a mostly sweet two-year-old poodle, except for the peeing (and sometimes pooping) inside thing.  I've now walked her three times:  First time: 45 minute walk about 4 hours after she was dropped off, she doesn't pee or poo (she had already pooped inside right after arriving.) Get inside and she has dinner then wants to play, then while playing squats down and just starts peeing... while jumping around. Ok, maybe put that one down to over-excitement... if it hadn't kept happening.  Second time: Another 45 minute walk, she does poo late into the walk and then I stand with her in my back-yard for an extra 10 minutes waiting for her to pee. Get back inside, she goes to her dog bed and lays down... then as I'm watching she gets up and squats down to pee in/around her bed.  Third time: Just walked her for over an hour, no pee or poo... so tied her up in the back-yard and stood there waiting over half an hour for her to go. Still nothing... right now I've just got her ""locked"" in the kitchen since the linoleum is a little easier to clean.  I just don't understand this though, every other dog I've ever owned/watched pees immediately when going outside... especially in the morning! It doesn't seem like a medical issue... she's not having trouble controlling her bladder. She goes hours just fine, and even asks to go out when one might expect it's time for her to potty. No accidents overnight even. It's just that when we walk, she seems to think she should potty inside after the walk...  Any ideas why a dog would act like this? Or how to correct her behavior? "
954,Should I add water to wet food to provide extra hydration?,"I haven't seen my kitten-cats drinking much water lately.  While they get hydration from their wet food, I'm not sure if it's necessarily enough for optimal health.  I'm considering just adding a bit of tap water to their wet food to make it a tad more wet, but I'm not sure if that'd be helpful, or if it might cause the food to spoil too fast.  Questions:   Should cats receive more hydration than from wet food alone? Could it be beneficial to add additional water to wet food? If additional water might be beneficial, how should it be added?   Should tap water be mixed with the wet food before serving? Or would a supplementary gravy or broth be better, e.g. ""Purina Fancy Feast Broths Adult Wet Cat Food Complement Variety Packs""?   "
955,Alternative for automatic dry cat feeder?,"I'll be going on vacation for 4 days so I'm looking for a way to feed my cats during this time.  I was considering something like this automatic dry cat feeder, but I'm not going to spend $60+ for just a few days.  Are there ant DIY or cheap alternatives?  Even if there isn't an alternative, anything I order would arrive too late. Finding a cheap alternative qould be great. "
956,Why is one of my male dogs drinking my other male dog's pee?,"Ive seen different versions of this question on here, but its usually male and female dogs - not dogs of the same gender. I'm curious if this is related pheromones or due to increased exercise (or whatever else people think is the reason).   I have a malamute/German-shepard and a lab/boxer/pit mix. The malamute rather aggressively drinks my lab-mix's pee every time they go outside to the bathroom. Literally laps it up mid stream and doesn't stop until my lab-mix stops peeing. Both are males, both are neutered. He doesn't drink excessive amounts of water either.  Both of these dogs get a stupid amount of exercise. The malamute gets 10-15 miles of running a day and both dogs chase me all day while backcountry skiing a few days a week. They are very well loved. They both get joint supplements and are free-fed. The malamute's appetite is usually good. He eats around 6-10 cups of food depending our activity for the day and is very lean at 104lbs.   What do you think is going on? Is this actually a pheromone deal, maybe he is trying to get electrolytes? Should I be concerned? "
957,How to make a cat comfortable towards a person with whom she relates a terrifying experience?,"One tenant girl had bought a huge teddy bear and came to show it.  Bhutu, my cat, reacted as if she has seen a ghost and ran for her life.   She is usually a very cheerful girl always trying to play with me and my family. She shows all shorts of circus the whole day.  But then as the tenant girl went away, she even forgot to meow for 4 to 5 hours.  Now, whenever Bhutu sees that girl she gets terrified and runs for cover.  That tenant girl loves Bhutu very much and comes to play with her everyday. Bhutu seemed to like the girl. She has known this girl for about 6 months now.  Now, how to make Bhutu comfortable with that girl again?  Also is it possible to remove Bhutu's fear towards teddy bears? "
958,Do cat / pet sanatoriums exist?,"I just discovered that my kitten has FeLV. Because this is no longer a death sentence for her, I decided to keep her. She is an indoor cat with no external feline contact, and she is otherwise healthy and happy. But the bias on FeLV is to euthanize around here. It got me thinking, are there places like the old sanatoriums for tuberculosis, consumption, etc., or even leper colonies, but for sick but happy cats or other pets? Where they can live out their lives without being a contagion threat, and with the needed extra care? Anywhere in the world, I ask out of pure interest... "
959,Why our cat loves us most even though our maids feed her? Is it natural animal behavior?,"In case of my cat Bhutu, neither me nor my mom feeds the cat. It is the two maids who feed the cat. Yet she showers all her affection on me and my mom.   She is just friendly towards the two maids.  Is this natural cat behavior? Also does it happen in all cats? "
960,Older kitten feeding schedule,"My SO and I recently adopted a pair of six month old kittens, and we're trying to work out how much to feed them.  (We have an older cat, but she's not relevant here, yet.)  Currently, we're feeding them a half cup of dry kibble four times a day (total: 2 cups), with occasional canned wet food.  When we feed them, they both gobble it all down quite happily (every last piece of kibble), and a few hours later are mewing at us for more.  It's extremely rare for them to actually leave any food behind.  Should we be feeding them more (within reason), to the point that they seem to have sufficient food?  Should we just ignore the mewing for more feeding?  Experiment to see how much they actually want?  We don't want them to become overweight, but we don't want to keep them constantly hungry, either. "
961,Kitten behaving strangely,"We have a 10 week old kitten that I recently adopted at the age of 6 weeks. Since we adopted him he's been sick quite a lot including ringworm, diaria and lately he has contracted some sort of virus that caused a very high fever on and off - for this he spent almost a week hospitalized with an IV drip.  During the time he was being treated for the virus the kitten started acting a bit weird - doing things he never did before and vise versa. For example he would cry asking for food (and look excited to receive it) but after we gave it to him he would sniff it a little bit and walk away not eating anything (and this is food he adored before he got sick).  Also he used to drink a lot of water from the sink along with our other cat (it was their thing) but now he isn't interested in it at all.  Currently he is still on antibiotics to fight the virus but has generally recovered. Since he stopped eating we tried all sorts of foods but the only food he'll eat now is fancy feast - and even then he's picky with the flavors.  The doctors are saying that generally he's fine now, but are still in the dark regarding this strange behavior. Having said that I should mention that one of that doctors aids stated that it might be FIP (The most fatal cat disease ever) since some of the symptoms are strange behavior, but they can't really be certain until things get really bad or they don't.. So now I'm worried sick that he might be dying :(  Has anyone encountered this type of behavior with their cats? Or maybe know what can be causing it?   Thanks "
962,The genetics of catnip susceptibility,"In doing a little looking around, I found three different answers to the question: What percent of cats are susceptible to catnip?   The Humane Society says ""an estimated 50 percent"" Scientific American says ""about 70 to 80 percent"" Cat World says ""around 50–66%""   Each source carefully notes the figure as an estimate.  None of them cite any sources or give any explanation beyond the figures coming from ""experts.""  (You'd think someone would take a poll, but that's not my point)  I recall hearing many years ago that the gene for catnip sensitivity followed a simple dominant-recessive pattern.  Similar to Mendel's peas, in a well-mixed population, you'll have the pairs RR, Rr, rR, and rr - only 25% (the rr group) will not express the trait, the other 75% will.  That would lend support to Scientific American's numbers.  However, if the genes that cause catnip sensitivity exhibit some form of co-dominance, like human blood groups, then the percentages can skew.  So my question comes down to:  What hard-science exists to explain the variation in sensitivity to catnip among cats?  Have there been any long-term breeding experiments?  Has that portion of the feline genome been explored at all? "
963,Low Quality Dog Food - What are the risks?,"I have an 11 year old Lab.  I have a friend that has a 15 year old lab.  I have another friend who put his 8 year old lab down.  Based upon the following experience I have a question.  The oldest lab, 15 years, has had a natural diet all it's life.  Some cooked meat, some raw meat, pumpkin and green beans. Every once in awhile it would get dog food but very rarely.  This dog is healthy.  Lots of grey hair but very chipper, good weight.  Trots to get balls, there is no more full sprint ball retrieval but this dog stays active.  The eleven year old is in pretty good shape but is beginning to fade.  Some dogfood (upscale, whattever that means), pumpkin and green beans.  Get's cooked chicken and fish remnants.  The 9 year old ate nothing but off the shelf grocery store dogfood.  Whattever was handy.  Poor guy had many tumors and cancer in it's intestinal tract.  Recently euthanized.  It seems that some of the dogs in my life that have been given a more healthy diet are experiencing greater longevity.  The owner of the 15 year old said, ""no dogfood for my dogs.  Only real food.    There is obviously not enough information to make a determination regarding the wellness of the dogs and their diet.    So my questions are   What are the risks of feeding my dog standard off the shelf dog food? What are the benefits to feeding a dog a diet of regular real food rather than processed food? Are there any studies or correlations of data to support one way or the other having a difference on the health of any pet?   There were some incidents a few years ago of a Chinese food manufacturer putting melanin in their food and it was sold in the US.  The results were horrific and there were quite a few deaths of pets.  I can't help but to think that in other processed foods there is harmful compounds that may not kill your pet in the short term but will effect it's health long term regarding various cancers or other malaise that could have an effect on longevity.  (I looked for a dupe of this but couldn't find one, if it is, let me know and I will delete)  TIA "
964,How can I determine if a probiotic product has ingredients that will be helpful to a GI illness?,"My friend has an elderly (female, spayed) cat who has developed a GI problem (diarrhea + scooting).  They are going through all of the veterinary recommended tests and treatments, but while waiting for results the vet suggested some probiotic treats (with the mindset that its unlikely to make things worse and may make things better).  How do we determine if probiotics would be helpful for the cat's condition (are they the right strain, are they alive, etc)? How can my friend determine if his vet is selling him snake oil? "
965,Cat does not like to poop into toilet,"I want to teach my cat to use a human toilet.  Currently he uses the toilet to urinate without any problem, but he does not like to poop there.  I do not understand why. He sniffs, goes around several times and then sits to poop on the floor right near the toilet. If I put a litter box on the toilet, then the cat uses the litter box without any hesitation.  Does anyone know the reason for such behavior? Any suggestions how to train the cat next?  Thanks. "
966,My parakeet is flirting with the feeding box. Does he needs a female parakeet?,"When I bought my third parakeet, he was shy. But after some weeks he became so happy and funny. But now I see he's flirting with the feeding box.   I don't know if he needs a female parakeet or he's just playing arround the cage due it only has got 11 months.  If he's just playing arround the cage, what can I do? Can I buy some toys for the bird? "
967,Two Cats: Better to feed together or separately?,"Is it ""more natural"" (or behaviorally preferable) for two domestic cats to eat together&hellip; or to feed them separately?   I have two cats, and one of them is what I would call an&hellip; aggressive eater. He's always been that way. I took him in as a young stray born of a feral parents, but I managed to domesticate him to be one of the sweetest cats you will ever know.   But feeding times brings out his posturing, and meals are consumed with a constant growling under his breath and guarded glances towards his happily-feeding companion like someone is going to take away his last meal for awhile. Of course that never happens; there is plenty for all.   My thinking was that teaching them to eat together would be a useful part of his social domestication&hellip; but a year later without success, I'm wondering if the potential sense of well-being is worth the stress of something he may never overcome. It has never escalated into anything physical &mdash; the other cat basically ignores him &mdash; and they get along famously in every other way.   Is there a better way to help assure him that the posturing is completely unnecessary? Is it even considered ""better adjusted"" if they can eat together? Or am I going against some basic instinct where they would be better off feeding separately? "
968,My long haired cat keeps getting dirty - how do I keep her clean and how do I clean her all the time,How do I clean my long haired cat and keep her clean? I've bathed her and the next day she smells like urine all the time. How do I keep her clean? What can I do to help her? I don't think she is happy about this either. 
969,"How many toys available at a time, and how often to rotate?","I have a basket with about 15-20 toys of various shapes, textures, colors, and sizes.  I keep about 5 to 8 out at a time, the rest remain in the hidden basket (in a cupboard over the fridge).  I know that cats get acclimated to toys, and will begin to ignore them (Hmph!  I've already killed that thing eleventy hundred times.)  With no real set schedule, every couple weeks I go around, find all the toys that went under appliances and chairs, gather up all the other toys, and put them in the basket. Then I put out other toys.  My cat has been with me only a few months so far, so each rotation introduces at least one new toy, but also brings back some familiar ones.  As toys wear out, I will trash them and buy new.  The cat seems to okay with this, and plays with his toys with equal vigor no matter how long they've been out.  At least, he hasn't complained so far.  I wonder about the long-term effectiveness of this (lack of a) plan.  Should I have more or fewer toys at a time?  Should I get the rotation on any schedule, and if so, how often?  Searches for ""rotate cat toys"" are all ads for cat toys that rotate, and ""switch/ change cat toys"" are about switching to different kinds of food or litter. "
970,Why does my cat meow in front of the door?,"I have recently returned from a trip and I've found that sometimes my cat goes to the main door of the house and starts meowing. The cat didn't use to do this before my trip. During this trip I left the cat alone at home and a friend of mine came everyday to feed the cat, play a bit with him, ...  Why does he do that? Is it normal? Is there any way to stop him from doing this so insistently? "
971,Can biting in pet mice be non agressive?,"I bought a pet fancy mouse three months ago. He was six months old at the time, so fairly young and not well socialized. I've spent a lot of time with him, getting him used to being handled and around people. Just like my last mouse, he did nip me a little bit and I taught him that nipping was not alright. The behavior disappeared and now I have a pretty good relationship with him. He willingly climbs onto my hand and even when I let him out to play in his playpen he still loves to come and climb all over me.  Recently, he started nipping again, but the behavior is... different. I don't feel that it is aggressive.  His nips do not hurt at all and are very light. Additionally, he is very slow and methodical with his teeth. I let him do it for a few seconds and what ended up happening was he just lightly held my finger in his mouth (no pain or breaking of the skin). I've been trying to discourage the behavior, but he seems intent on continuing.  I'm not really sure what to think about the behavior. Is it social? Aggressive? Something odd that only he does? Should I discourage it or simply let him continue? "
972,What steps should I take to prepare myself for dogsitting?,"My background is a non-dog owner; I will soon be looking after my sister's two year old male goldendoodle who was homed with them at the age of eight months. I'll be looking after him for about a week while his family are out of the country. My nephews will be around if I have questions while my sister is away, and my SO loves dogs1 so I'm not taking this on completely alone!  I will be discussing this with my sister, naturally, but are there any general things I should be aware of? Particularly aspects that someone who is used to having dogs might overlook when briefing someone who isn't! I already know about his usual walk frequency and timing, and that he will be my best friend if I keep some treat on me!   Lastly, I understand that this cross can be prone to anxiety. I've met him and played with him on a few occasions, so I won't be a completely new and strange face. I also assume that I'll be able to borrow his usual sleeping basket and some of his toys while he is a guest at mine; and plan to ask my nephew round so that he has another familiar face. What signs of anxiety should I look out for; and if he does seem anxious, what can I do to ameliorate this?  Update:  The week has been and gone without incident. The only things I can think of to add to the excellent answer provided by Victoria are:   Gear for walking. You might think ""I walk places, no big deal"", but bear in mind you might be walking two or more hours per day and plan accordingly. That means both waterproofs and decent footwear at least! Knowing a bit about how a particular dog will communicate is useful too. Spending time with him/her (as mentioned in comments) can help here, but if nothing else it can be reassuring to know that what appears to be an ""Oh god I'm dying""-type whine might only be a  way of saying ""I'd like to go out"" or ""I'm bored and would like attention"".   We both had a great week- thanks in part to the constructive advice here! :)    1 She has a very cute looking pitbull back home, unfortunately a continent away so out of the question for the purposes of experience or socialisation with my sister's dog!

973,Red eared slider moving large land items,"I have a red eared slider approximately 4 years of age, about 7"" in girth and about 10"" in length. It has an above water basking area that is accessed by a ramp. The basking area has three flat rocks approximately 6"" in diameter surrounded by pea gravel. My turtle has recently began using it's hind legs to throw the pea gravel over into the water. In the last two days the turtle has manipulated the large rocks over the side of the platform into the water. Again there are 3 rocks, approximately 6"" in diameter, 1"" thick, weighing a couple of pounds a piece!!!  I know the turtle is incredibly strong, but what's going on??? I don't know why my turtle is behaving this way. Oh, I'm not sure of gender (OK, I'm stupid) but he/she has never been around another turtle. Might this be some sort of ""False pregnancy"" behavior in that it's searching for sand or a softer material than pea gravel to lay eggs?  Otherwise, my turtle is very healthy and behaving as always otherwise. Any help would be greatly appreciated "
974,How late can I train my cats to let me sleep in?,"I have a pair of 6-month-old kittens. About a month ago, they decided that their day should begin before 4am. (Note that they have dry food available all the time, and get some wet at the beginning and end of the day.) Prior to that, serenading was heard more like 5:30am. So, I've been 'ferberizing'(*) them -- I go to sleep with earplugs in place, and I don't open the door and let them into the bedroom until I'm ready. After about two weeks of this, the first serious serenade usually comes along at 5:20am. So, what's a reasonable ambition here? Should I just decide that 5:30am is the start of the cat day, at least for now? Or would further struggle result in relative quiet until 6:00am?  Based on the answers so far, I think a bit of elaboration is in order.  This is not my first trip to the cat rodeo; I am well aware that a closed door is a moral insult to the average domestic cat. However, we've never owned a cat who was prepared to be a polite 'midnight visitor' -- whether it's playing hockey with items on dressers or licking exposed ears. In the past, household geometry permitted a division of territory into cat vs. person that put the evil door far enough away from our bedroom that any complaining was not a big issue.  Thus, the initial yes-or-no character of this question: ""Is it reasonable to think that they will learn that companionship and canned cat food will only arrive at time X, and so it's not worth the effort to make a fuss earlier?""  As of when I'm writing this addendum, we have a pair of answers: ""Yes"" and ""Maybe (depending on their motivations, and here are some other strategies, and maybe canned cat food first thing is not such a brilliant plan.)""  A finding of 'No' leads either towards a reconsideration of household geometry options, or an exploration of how to leave the bedroom door open at night without serving as a 2am trampoline (a subject for another question).  (*) Note that we are not literally following ferber by trying to gradually increase the amount of time; in the case at hand, I'm pretty sure that this would only serve to teach them that endurance is a winning strategy. "
975,Is a clean up crew necessary if there is no evident algae?,"I've recently just established that my saltwater aquarium has cycled through Ammonia, Nitrites, and Nitrates are ~10-20 ppm. I have been and am still ghost feeding the tank, since I purchased dry rock as I didn't want any unnecessary hitch hikers introduced to my tank right off the bat. I have talked to the LFS experts and they would like me to get my cleanup crew, but, alas, there doesn't seem to be any visible evidence of anything to clean up! I've cured the rock and cycled the tank with minuscule or no light. The tank has been cycling in a window-less basement room, so there is absolutely no shred of natural light either.      How would the clean up crew benefit me at this point, other than adding more   ammonia than my ghost feeding?   I mean, I realize that eventually I will need to add crabs and snails, but I'm thinking I should do that after I have fish in there and actually start seeing some algae to clean up right? "
976,Is keeping a cat indoors cruel?,"Our cat is 3 years old and her previous owners had her since she was a kitten.

977,New cat wont stop meowing,"I have a new cat from the Humane Society that was once a street cat. It's about a year old and it wont stop meowing whenever it knows there's a human around. I've had it about a week and have kept it in my room, as per the humane societies recommendation. When im in another part of my apartment and I am quiet, it will eventually stop meowing. When it's on my lap or sleeping it sometimes stops meowing.  Essentially, if it knows someone can give it attention it will scream and scream. I let it out of my room once and it ran to center of each other room , one after the other, screaming loudly.  I purchased Feliway about 4 days ago to help with the transition but so far no luck.  What can I do to keep from driving myself and my neighbours insane? Will the cat always be this noisy and needy? "
978,Moving my cat and going on vacation around the same time?,"My lease is up this summer and I'm planning on moving apartments. The problem is that I also have a 3-day trip scheduled to start the day my lease ends (cannot be changed).  My cat will be a little over a year old at that point and has always lived indoors at my current apartment. When I go on trips, I usually have a cat-sitter come to the apartment. I've only boarded her once, just for the day, and she took a few hours to return to normal after coming home.  I'm concerned about her reaction to moving to a strange new place, especially if I were to leave immediately after. What is the least bad option for her?   Move a week or so early, leave her there and go on trip (avoids boarding, but is that enough time for her to get used to it?) Board her, move, go on the trip, and bring her back to the new apartment afterwards (or would that be doubly traumatic?)  "
979,Simple care for baby tokay,"Today I met in my house what I believe is a baby tokay. It's about the size of a small common house gecko, but it is black with faint white dots and less shy.  It's currently under my sofa.  Does it need anything? Should I provide a tiny bowl of water? Sausage? Chicken egg? I don't have any worms, crickets, flies or the like. (There are probably a few ants under the sofa.) Should I better chase it outside (I'm in Thailand, so it's warm) or leave it there?  I don't plan on keeping it as a pet, but I don't mind it staying with me for a few days. "

982,Did my lost kitten return?,"My 2 or 3 year old cat had 2 litters and raising the third one now. Her second litter had 5 kittens, one black, two gray tabbies, and two orange tabbies. One orange tabby was light orange. The mother brought them out on August 12, 2016. They already opened their eyes after, a couple days the light orange tabby we called Sandy was gone. I searched for her but had no luck after, 6 months the mother cat had her third litter.  After almost 2 months after the third litter was born a light orange cat came with the believed to be the father of all the three litters. I try to figure out it's sex but, it always runs away. I think it is a female because the father does not attack it.  They also visit the mother cat and the kittens are there too. The light orange tabby started to visit the mother cat more often. Could this be the lost kitten? And if so did it wander off and someone adopted it or did it survive being taken by an animal.  Every time we leave the mother cat alone outside when we check on here the light orange tabby usually comes. It just started today. It always runs away from us. How do I make it know that I am not going to hurt them? "
983,My dog doesn't like people of a certain race. What can I do?,"We got a Black Labrador when he was five years old, and he's been a really wonderful dog in the years we've had him. Normally he barks to let us know when people have arrived at our front door, but calms down quickly when we let them in and is very friendly to our guests.  A week ago, my Asian friend, whom my dog had never met, came by to pick something up. As soon as my dog saw him in the window, he went absolutely ballistic in a way that I had never seen before. He would not stop barking at my friend when he came in, but fortunately he did not try to bite. My friend didn't think anything of it and tried petting him (my dog tried to avoid it), but I was absolutely mortified that he was behaving so angrily towards my friend. It was a short visit and my dog was on edge for a while afterwards.  I had kind of forgotten the incident until I was walking my dog and we passed an Asian man I didn't know. My dog also went crazy over him and I had to drag him away. My area has very few Asians living in it, so this is a rarity. I wondered if my dog was reacting to their appearance, especially given that in both cases it's very unlikely he smelled anything.   Since I don't know anything about my dog's early life, I'm going to give him the benefit of the doubt and assume that he's not ""racist"", but rather has an understandable reason for this reaction, such as a very negative experience with someone who is Asian. He hadn't really been exposed to them since living with me, so there was no chance to get acclimated.  What can I do to help my dog overcome this strong reaction to Asian men? Would having my friend spend time with him (or just be present at my house more often) be enough? "
984,"Dog anxious inside, calm outside","We got a dog a few days ago. He's a 1 year old Chesapeake Bay/Lab mix according to the vet. He was found abandoned in the country, rescued, made it to us eventually. He's not yet neutered, we're going to change that. He starts obedience school in two weeks, but he already knows some commands (come, sit, paw, down). He's crate trained as well. He gets at least one, sometimes two, long walks every day and we have a decent sized yard.  When he's outside in the yard he's calm. He'll happily play, or lay in the sun or shade, or just watch the cars go by. He barks sometimes, but when told not to he listens. Outside he's fantastic.  Inside is a different story. When he's inside he's always pacing and panting excessively, sometimes he whines. He's unable to settle down. Sometimes he comes over and throws his weight against me (which I have a lot of trouble with). He's also taken to chasing the cats, which we're trying to nip in the bud.  There are a few factors I can see contributing to this, but I'm not sure how to help still.    We have a cat and a kitten. The cat frequently will hiss, growl, or otherwise voice his displeasure any time he sees the dog. This seems to rile up the dog. The kitten is more afraid of him and the dog has pinned him down and cornered him a few times. We want to make sure the cats aren't injured. I can see how the cats can be a stress point for him. My husband is far from being a dog person. He's willing to tell the dog ""No"" or ""Back"" and defend the cats but that is the limit of his dog interaction. Having a person around he isn't allowed to interact with also seems to make him stressed.  He can't really see out any of the windows inside. This is a combination of the height of the windows and the furniture arrangement. I've been trying to rearrange furniture to give him window access but so far he does not seem interested. I'm not sure how big of a factor this is. He doesn't have a ton of time at the moment. A filled bone, a kong, two small stuffed animals, an ""unstuffed"" squeaky animal, tennis ball, and tug rope. I'm very open to getting him more toys, I'm just not sure what to get him and how many he should have.   I know we haven't had him very long, and things will get better when we start obedience classes; but I'd really like to make his inside-life better in the meantime if I can.  What can I do to make him feel more comfortable inside? Does anyone have advice on training him that I am his human and my husband is not?   TL;DR: Dog is calm outside of house but stressed and anxious inside. How can I help him? "
985,Pit Bull mix that bit someone - is it likely he will bite again?,"My daughter has a Pit bull mix. He is 14 months old. She was walking him on a leash and my neighbor wanted to pet the dog, but my daughter said no because she did not know how the dog would act. My neighbor said that is ok and went to pet the dog and the dog bit his hand. He needed one stitch on the back of his hand.  My question is, will this dog bite again? I have small grandchildren. What should we do? "
986,Male cat is attacking female cat when he sees/smells another cat,"I'm currently experiencing behavioral problems in my male cat that has escalated over the approximate year since they started.   Fable is a 4 year old male, and Twitch is one month younger. They've been together since ages 12 weeks and 8 weeks, were adopted within a few days of each other from the same shelter but different rooms, and were fixed and declawed at 5-6 months about a week or so apart. They get along really well, will often groom each other, play, and sleep together. Sometimes play can get a little rough and she'll hiss or growl at him to signal she's done and he'll quit after a few warnings.  The cats are indoor cats, but we have a fully screened in porch so we often leave the door to it open for them. There's several cats that come roaming around onto our property, and if they get too close to the porch, Fable gets extremely territorial.  The first instance about a year ago a male stray came up to say hi to them through the screen door, and Fable muscled his way between Twitch and the stray. He didn't do anything aggressive to her, but seemed very clearly to be guarding her. The next time it happened was when he started hitting her. Since then, it has escalated to him hitting her more, chasing her through the house, pinning her down and biting (though no injuries), and the past two times she has urinated in fright.  We're able to stop Fable just by grabbing him by the scruff and holding him still for a few moments, and Twitch will take anywhere from 30 minutes to several hours to calm down before she's back to her self, which we consider a reasonably quick recovery. After this everything goes back to normal for a few weeks until another cat gets too close to the porch.   My theory is that when he smells another cat, it overwhelms his senses and he no longer recognizes Twitch by smell, so he attacks her because she's a cat. This is possible because he hit her once before after she came home from being fixed and she smelled like the vet and drugs instead of herself. My mom thinks he's just lashing out at her to chase her away from the other cat because he can't attack and chase away the cat on the other side of the screen so he's trying to separate them by any means necessary. However these are both just guesses to try to describe the scenario better.  I'm looking for possible solutions to this problem.   We're considering locking up at sunset, as most of these incidents happen after dark, but that only avoids the problem and can also be frustrating for everyone because they won't understand why they can't go onto the porch when they could before.   We've tried scaring off the cats with yelling and even throwing things in their direction to no avail, and we don't want to put out anything scent-deterring in case it bothers our cats or any of the forest animals near our property.  We don't want to put either cat on medication.   As far as I know, punishment after the fact is useless, since Fable won't understand if we punish him after he calms down, and if we punish him while he's in a fight mood, he might escalate the situation with us.  They are well exercised for house cats. They play several times a day both with each other and alone with their toys, and we throw treats across the house for Fable to chase instead of handing him them. We don't believe he is pent up.  We don't have any family members or friends with cats, so we can't have anyone bring a cat by to try to get him accustomed to strangers and we're not even sure that would work.   Are there any training methods to handle this kind of aggression? Can we train him somehow to not go into a fight mode when he sees/smells an unfamiliar cat? Or is the only option to avoid the situation entirely?  "
987,How can I get my cat to like me?,"I have a five year old cat named Binx. I've had him since birth. I also have two other cats that are his sisters. Only four years old. Binx has never really been a cuddly, passionate cat until about two years ago when he started giving all of his attention to my dad. My dad dislikes cats- although he doesn't mind Binx. But Binx loves him! He goes crazy once he gets home from work. He'll follow him around the house, lay on his chest, knead him and purr like crazy. He doesn't do any of this with me. I feed him and play with him so I always thought he'd be somewhat close to me but he's not. He doesn't care to be around me. He's had crystals for almost his whole life and every time he's gotten them I'm around and I'm the one to take him to the vet so I'm unsure if he's associating me with these bad moments?   His two sisters Maisie and Ella are nothing like him. They love coming around me and are constantly wanting my attention. I'm not sure if maybe he's jealous, but I always give him the same amount of attention I do the others, and he doesn't want it. I'm at a loss of what to do. I want to be close to him like my dad is. Any tips on what I can do? Or on what I can differently would be very much appreciated!  "
988,Struvite crystals.,I have a five year old cat who was diagnosed with struvite crystals. He's had it ever since he was about One to one and a half. He's done a catheter a few times and he's now on special food to help. He hasn't had them since 2014! Which I'm grateful for. Is there anything I can do extra or buy to make sure they stay away? I constantly worry about him because if it happens again I'm afraid I won't be able to pay for the cost of his vet bill this time around if it happens suddenly which it use to do. Also are there any types of treats you can feeds cat that have this issue? I always want to treat him and give him something other than his cat food that he's stuck with but I'm too scared to try regular treats incase they cause the crystals. Any advice would be helpful and appreciated. 🙂 
989,Why does my cat attack my arms when I stretch?,"I occasionally stretch by putting my arms straight over my head, and then lowering them to horizontal. I end up in a position like this:    Every time I do this around my cat, she runs over and stares intently at my arms, waits for me to lower them, and then jumps up and tries to bite them. It doesn't matter if I move quickly or slowly (she'll wait).  I have figured out she won't pounce if I keep my arms tucked at the elbows and closer to my body, instead of straight out from my sides.  I don't get it! Do I look like something to hunt when I do that? Any ideas why that particular movement triggers a response? "
990,Why is my cat pulling her nail?,"Most of the time while washing herself, she also starts to 'grab' the nail to one of her 'thumbs' with her teeth and it looks like she is pulling it really hard. Don't know if she does it with other nails too, but I have seen it before. The nail doesn't look strange or anything.  Is that normal behavior? Why is she doing that?  EDIT Actually I've observed her doing it at both front paws and at least both 'thumbs'. "
991,Is there a reason guinea pigs need a cage without a wire bottom?,"I picked up a pair of guinea pigs this weekend and I noticed that all of the guinea pig cages I find for sale in the stores and online have solid bottoms, as opposed to a wire mesh bottom many rabbit cages have.  Is there a reason that guinea pigs need a solid bottom?  Is there any way that I can utilize my wire mesh cages that I use for rabbits to house the guinea pigs? "
992,Is my bioload too high?,I have about 12 plants in my 60 gallon tank. I am planning on adding the following:     6 Albino Corys      3 Black Mollys      1 Male Gourami and 2 female Gourami      3 SAEs (siamese algae eaters)      5 Yo-Yo Loaches   Would that be too high of a bioload? How can I measure the bioload of a tank? 
993,How do I help my cat tolerate a bad-tasting liquid medicine?,"My cat is currently on Atopica, which comes as a liquid.  Apparently this medicine tastes awful, based on his reaction to it.  Mixing it into food or tuna juice does not help; he rejects the entire bowl, even if the ratio of drug to food is fairly low.  There is another cat in the household, so I can't just leave it out for a while in hope that he'll come around -- I have to supervise (or isolate somebody, but that's no fun).  Now that I know how to give a cat a pill I plan to ask about getting this as a pill when it's time to refill, but that'll be a couple months.  In the meantime, is there anything I can do to help my cat tolerate the taste of this medicine?  Are there particular foods that do a better job of masking unpleasant flavors, for instance?  I'm already pushing the syringe as far back as I can to minimize contact with his mouth/tongue.  The cat is a ~7-year-old neutered male, indoor-only, with no known medical issues other than the allergies for which this drug is being used. "
994,How safe is it to dress up a turtle?,"I keep seeing pictures of pet turtles in various knitted costumes (so far I have seen a turtle dressed as a hamburger, and as a dinosaur), and while these are really cute, I wonder, are they okay for the turtle to wear? I would think people are only using them for photo props, but at the same time, they might not be. Are there risks to that sort of thing?  "
995,Spray bottle becoming ineffective,"I have two cats, both under 6 months old (I guess you could call them kittens). I have used a spray bottle in the past as negative reinforcement, which worked great on one of them (the one that's scared of water) and less effectively  on the other (which, for some reason really likes water).   Lately, this has proven to be less effective. The latter cat (water lover) is no longer responding to this bad reinforcement and doesn't seem to be fazed by the mist of water.  Can I add something to the water, without it being harmful to the cat, that will make it more uncomfortable for him and maybe react to the use of the bottle in the way I expect him to? (Maybe a tinge of lemon juice for sting?) "
996,What are the basic requirements of a healthy adult rabbit's diet?,"We have a few questions such as Why is adding hay to a rabbit's diet important? and Why is iceberg lettuce bad for rabbits? However, they don't necessarily tell you what the basic diet should look like.  So, as a rabbit keeper, what are some basic diet requirements that I should follow, and pay attention to, in order to help ensure that my rabbits remain healthy and happy? "
997,How can I transition my ferrets to a new diet?,"Currently, my ferrets eat a mix of raw beef, hen, chicken, pork, and the bones &amp; organs. I usually purchase these on sale from the supermarket.   I've started ordering from a new place because it's already prepared and balanced for me. But a couple of my ferrets haven't been eating it that much. It's the same meats that I've been giving them. It just has all the organs and bones ground up and mixed in.  A couple of my ferrets are not eating that much of it, so I've still had to rely on their previous diet (which is a lot more work). I've tried putting Ferretone on the new stuff and mixing it with bits of the old. The change has been gradual over the past few days.   I know ferrets imprint on food at a young age and it is difficult to change their diet as adults. I think they're just being stubborn and fussy since they do eat little bits of it. Is there anything else I can do to get them to eat more of the new stuff? Or do I just need to keep at it and make sure they still get their old diet? "
998,How can I tell if my goldfish is being bullied?,"I was watching my goldfish swim around and one appeared to be chasing the other in circles. This did not last long and then they seemed to be relaxed and following each other and just swimming together. I am concerned, as if there is bullying, I will have to separate them.  What is healthy fish behavior, and what is a sign that there is bullying?  This is after asking this question here: Can goldfish bully each other after an injury? "
999,Why is our cat bringing his toy to us and whining?,"So I have a cat who's a bit of a loner.  Really hates contact unless it's under his terms and he very rarely wants contact except for about 10 minutes in the morning.  Unwanted contact is met with serious aggression.  He's been neutered if that matters at all, and he's 5.  Now onto my question.  Most nights he'll pick up his favorite toy and meow (which sounds more whiny than usual), bring it to us, then look at us, meowing expectantly.  If we reach for the toy, he sits on our arms and look panicked in what I can only describe as a submissive/aggressive, almost playful, but slightly pathetic way.  No biting unless it's very soft, which is very unusual for him.  After we reach for it a couple of times, he'll take it away and return a couple minutes later, back to normal.  Question: What is this? What is he doing? Why? "
1000,Giant gourami tolerate tank mates?,"Right now, I have 2 fish tanks in my home and it is very difficult for me to maintain both at the same time.  I have attached images of both fish tanks and fishes living in them.  In fish tank 1, I have a giant gourami.  Tank 1 picture:   In fish tank 2, I have:   Kissing Gourami Milky White koi carp Sliver Shark Blue Gourami Twin Fin Sea Angel plecostomus   Tank 2 picture:   I have heard that giant gourami can kill the other fish like oscar and arowana.  My question is, can the giant gourami live with all these fish in a single tank, or do I have to keep it alone?   If I put them in a single tank, what kind of filtration is required? "
1001,How do I get my dachshund to be interested in toys?,"I have a dachshund who will not actively play with toys. She will, very rarely, pick up a bone or a chew toy (mostly a bone).  She has a myriad of toys available to her, ranging from small, fluffy, squeeky toys, to large rubber rings, a coupled stuffed animals, some rubber chew toys shaped like food, ropes for tugging, some kongs, etc.  She has some small circular bones available and a long bone.  No rawhides, no pig ears, no hooves.  99.9% of the time, she ignores the majority of the toys she has available to her.  She does chase a bone if she's in the right mood, but will never fetch it back; she will either ignore the bone one she arrives, or will pick it up, walk to another location to chew it, and leave the bone there when called to play again.  That is the only play activity she seems to interact with; she won't go after a toy if thrown.  When I leave her, I break up a dog treat to fill a dog puzzle, which is always ""solved"" less than 5 minutes of my departure.  I leave the TV on for her when I go out.  She loves to be by my side and pursues any cat or squirrel that enters the yard.  She actively patrols our yard for intruders.  She likes to lay on her back in the sun.  She is very intelligent; she always seems to know exactly what I want her to do.  She simply will not play, and I want her to be entertained when I am unable to play with her or when she's unable to go outside.  She does respond well to treats and food, but I don't want to overload her with treats as doxies are prone to getting overweight.  What can I do for her to keep her busy?  How can I entice her to be interested in her toys? "
1002,Why did my ammonia level rise after a water change?,"I have the API freshwater kit. I tested for 0.25 ppm ammonia and 40ppm nitrate. After the water change, I have 0.50 ppm ammonia and 5ppm nitrate. WHAT THE HECK?  In fact right before I put water in and after I took 25% water out, my ammonia was 8 ppm. I cleaned the gravel, so maybe that's why the ammonia rose? But that doesn't make sense.  I treated my water before adding it with API stress-coat, which is a dechlorinator / dechloraminator and Stress Zyme, which adds bacteria. I also added Seachem Flourish for plants. "
1003,When does a dog need to wear a jacket or sweater?,"I live in the northeast United States, and the weather can become fairly cold here in the winter.  Jackets and sweaters for dogs seem to be popular around here, but are they necessary?  I can understand some breeds of dogs with shorter fur needing some additional assistance in cold weather, particularly if they originated in warmer climates (e.g. chihuahuas).  However, I frequently see dogs with longer fur bundled up against the cold, such as terriers, poodles, and bichons.  Are these merely fashion accessories, or do dogs need protection from cold weather even on short walks?  If the extra protection provides actual comfort, instead of fashion, how do you determine when the weather is cold enough to merit it for a dog?  Presumably the point at which clothing becomes beneficial varies from breed to breed; is there a simple guideline I can use?   "
1004,How to minimize litter being tracked out of a custom litter box?,"tl;dr-  I'm making a litter box and I want to design it in a way that prevents cats from tracking much litter out of it.  How could this be done?    I'm designing a do-it-yourself litter box because normal litter boxes aren't quite sanitary enough.  I have two main complaints:   I can't stand the smell of cat litter or cat leavings. I don't like how litter can track when cats come out of a litter box.   So, my solution's basically this (don't do this at home, may not be safe/correct, etc.):   Get a big plastic box, e.g. this 25-gallon Rubbermaid storage container. Cut a hole in a side of the box and insert a cat door, e.g. this one.   Some commercial cat boxes already have doors, though these doors tend to let air through on purpose.  This design intentionally seeks a more air-tight door, so I figure I'll use one designed as a pet door for a house.  Cut two more holes in the top/upper-side of it and run air tubes with low-noise blower fans.   This 4-inch fan is rated 47 CFM (ft^3/min) with 25dB at 9W. This 4-inch tubing and clamps to go with the fan. Probably some sort of screen or/and filter to keep bugs out and kittens in.  Mount a block of wood in a window sill.   The block'll basically prevent the window from fully closing; instead, the window'll close on it. The block'll have two 4-inch holes in it on either side for connecting the tubes. The two 4-inch holes would be on opposite sides of the window to help minimize out-going air being drawn back in.  Connect litter box to window with tubes&amp;blowers to continuously vent the litter box's internal air with fresh air.   I suspect that this should pretty much cover the smell part.  If too much of the litter stench still gets through the litter box's door, I might have a second-stage box that's also vented with separate tubes.  All that said, there's still the problem of the cats tracking litter.  How can this be addressed?  Current ideas:   Actually do the second-stage box, then put a litter mat in it.   However, I already have litter mats outside of my current litter boxes, but some litter's still getting tracked out anyway.  Have the cats climb down into the litter box area such that they have to climb up to get back out.   Maybe the climbing-out process will help clean the litter off?  Narrow corridor into the litter box with web-like matting.   Perhaps this would brush the cats off as they climb into/out-of the litter box?    Is there another way a litter box like this might be designed to minimize litter tracking? "
1005,My dog bit a puppy,"I have a 3.5 year old female Labrador.I have had her since she was 8 weeks old.She is extremely friendly when we meet other people and dogs.I have been taking her to a dog park for a few months now and spend about an hour every day at the dog park.She usually gets other dogs to chase her with a stick in her mouth.I am always supervising her play at the park.If she doesn't like a dog behavior (mainly humping) she will let them know politely 2-3 times and then I usually intervene and make sure that dog leaves her alone before she snaps.  Yesterday, after about 45min at the dog park, I took her to my friend's place to meet their new puppy ( 12 weeks Akita male). I have met the puppy before and he is very calm and relaxed.My dog was excited to see the pup.This was the pup's first encounter with a dog socially(other than the vet and walks). My dog picked a toy and wanted to play tug with the pup.The pup was happy too and at that point, they seemed to get along well.They went to the yard to play.My friend was supervising them.I was inside talking to my friend.After a couple of minutes of play, the pup started whelping in pain.I didn't punish my dog at that time.I am not exactly sure what happened.  The pup has 2 bites on the ear, 1 on the muzzle and 1 on the jaw.There was some blood.The pup was scared for quite some time.  What steps should I take to make sure my dog doesn't do something like this ever again.I know I should have been supervising them play and probably introduced them slowly in a confined space.Should I not take my dog to the dog park? Does that make her more aggressive? She knows she is not supposed to bite humans, I have tried inculcating the bite inhibition from puppyhood.She is very gentle with kids.  I am really sad that this happened and want to make sure that I train her positively to not do it again.But I am not sure what that entails.Would really appreciate some advice and suggestions. "
1006,Cat Sub-Q Ringer's Solution: Not DPHV Free?,"I received a donation or 4 bags of Hospira Brand Ringer's Solution (1000 ml each) and they say that they are not DPHV-free. My cat is in Stage 3 kidney disease. Is it too dangerous to trust this type of solution for even a few weeks? He must have 150 ml per day.  The bags have already reached their expiration dates. Two were ""expired"" on Jan 1, 2018, and the other two were expired 2 weeks ago on Feb 1, 2018. The entire plastic quality is not clear like with some other brands bags, but the color is the same for the entire bag, not just where the solution is stored. Solution looks ""clear"" and not cloudy or darker than the plastic. Probably not as dark as the plastic.  I was told when given these bags that the bags should be used within the next 4 weeks.  What do I do? There is a scarcity of Ringer's Solution/IV bags right now due to the hurricane in Puerto Rico that disabled the facilities that provide most of these products to the USA. Each bag is going for $16 each in my area. "
1007,How much fur does a cat shed?,"Is there any known estimate of the total mass of fur shed by a cat over a year? I can find some anecdotal estimates that full regrowth can be achieved over 8 to 12 weeks, but that does not give me any answer with regards to the actual mass.    Some precisions:   The answer certainly depends on the cat size but also type of hair, and environment. Cat owners easily observe that shed amounts vary depending on, for instance, current temperature (the animal gets a lighter fur in summer, and denser in winter). It is possible that the growth rate varies with temperature. As such, there cannot be a simple answer valid for all cats, but that does not mean that the question is unanswerable, only that the answer will consist in multiple data points. It's like a question about the height of a human: not all humans have the same height, but it is not totally meaningless to talk of averages. Cats are neither photosynthetic nor nuclear-powered. As such, the carbon atoms found in the fur keratin can only come from their food intake (excluding water). Basically, if a cat east 200g of food per day, then it cannot shed more than 200g of fur per day on average, or 73 kg over a year. But I really expect the figure to be a lot lower than that. I find unsubstantiated claims that an average cat may have 20 to 40 millions of hair, with an average thickness of about 20µm, and can grow back a complete coat in ""8 to 12 weeks"" (if shaved). Assuming an average length of 4 cm per hair, and that hair density is close to that of water, then the total fur weight (under these assumptions) would be 250 to 500g and the beast could produce such an amount 5 times per year, leading to a total of up to 2.5 kg over a year.  This estimate is based on totally unscientific figures that could be off by a large amount. Moreover, if the growth rate varies depending on conditions, then chances are that a fully-shaved cat will have a higher growth rate, and a non-shaved cat will settle for a lower growth rate and thus shedding amount.   Thus, I am trying to find some better sources for data so as to get at least ballpark numbers. Basically, are we talking about 100g, 1kg, 10kg per year or so? "
1008,Can a house get too hot for tropical fish and what precautions could we take?,"We really want to get tropical fish but there's a problem. In the state we live in it can get as high as low 40*C's in the summer and worse, we don't have insulation installed in our house.  Would it get way too hot for the fish even without a heater? When it gets too hot, could I even get a tank cooler for it? Are fish tank coolers adjustable for temp? Would it be possible without frying the fish? "
1009,My cat is afraid of me and plays aggressively,"I recently adopted a 1 and a half months cat.  He was very calm and friendly when i first brought him home and he would sleep on everyone's lap. So i took him to the vet to get him checked and make sure he's Ok. The vet diagnosed him with a disease which he said he's got it from his mother. So i had to apply an eye drop to his eyes every six hours or he could lose his eyes. He didn't like it at all. I had to force him to sit stable so i could apply the eye drop.  Since then, he is almost always afraid of people and me(unless he's sleepy), he never sits on lap, never purrs and plays really aggressively and bites and scratches.When someone is approaching him, he puffs his tail and runs away(most of the time).  He's now at 2 months and a half of age. So my question here is, is he ever going to go back normal and show some affection and be nice , or will he remain this way? Should i rehome him or is he scared of all people? What should i do to make him trust me again? What should i avoid doing? Thank you and sorry for the length of this question. "
1010,Injured semi stray cat,"I have a semi stray cat. we feed him daily and he goofs around in our backyard for most of the day. However, he seems to be very active now a days and picks up fight with other cats in the mating season.  The one occasional scratch is fine, but last week he got beat up pretty bad and is missing a 2 sq cm patch of skin on his front right elbow and internal flesh is exposed. It looks pretty bad. i had a look at the following questions.  How can I bring an unwilling cat to the vet?  How to get my spayed 4 year old Tom cat to stop fighting the neighbourhood  Calming down feral cat to take to vet?  Now the problem is he is wary of my any attempts to even catch him and runs away. and i dont have access to traps. The max he is allowing me to do is douse the area with Iodine solution.  Am sure if this is not treated he will not make it. What can be done now? sedate him first with some medicine or use oral antibiotics? will this heal by itself?  location: India "
1011,My aquarium heaters don't appear to be working?,"We had a power outage for 2 days from a storm, and since then my two aquarium heaters don't seem to be working( I know it takes a couple hours to warm up &amp; the light only comes on and off when heat gets to the point...) But  it's been like a week and I haven't seen the light come on in either of my two tanks, and I don't have a thermometer to test the heat.. and my apple snails are so slow and nearly come out of their shells.. and I have 2 pregnant guppies ready to pop- but I don't think they will at this pipnt because it too cold? Are the heaters dead? How can that happen? Ps. I know I really need the get thermometers.. Plz help! "
1012,How high a PSL is considered normal in cats with no other symptoms of pancreatitis?,"My cat recently had a blood test that includes measuring PSL (pancreas serum level? lipase?).  This was a broader senior-cat panel, not an fPLI.  The result was higher than what the lab considers the normal range, and came with approximately this note: ""In a cat with no other symptoms indicating pancreatitis, a moderately-high level is inconclusive"".  (I haven't seen the report yet; my vet was reading this to me over the phone.)  What they don't say is what's considered ""moderately high"".  With a normal range going up to 26 (I don't know the units either), do they mean not to worry about 30? 50? 100?  I tried searching VIN and found this article that mentions what might be this test, but it doesn't talk about ranges of results.  A general Google search didn't turn up anything either.  (Maybe I have the expansion of ""PSL"" wrong and that's my problem.) "
1013,How can I mark my own territory and communicate this to my pet rabbit?,"So we got a holland lop rabbit a few weeks ago second hand from another couple.  He's been great so far, but I've been reading online about communicating with my rabbit by mimicking his own behavior, such as communicating insult by walking up to him, taking a step back, then turning my back on him, similar to what he does to me when i do something he doesn't like and he demands an apology in this way.  I also read that rabbits understand territory in 3 categories, their own personal space shared with a mate and only close personal friends - public space, shared by all, and territory owned by someone else.  I wonder, how can I mark my own territory (such as my bedroom) so he will understand this is my territory, and be less likely to wander in there and get in to things.  Rabbits mark by peeing or pooping, I'm certainly not going to take a dump on my carpet.. lol - so how can I mark my territory in a way he'll understand and respect? it's easy to be a human about it, consistently remove him from a room etc.. and he'll eventually learn ""if i go in there, I'm gonna get kicked out, so i wont go in there"" - but I want to do it in a way where his natural instincts kick in and tell him ""this is someone else's territory"" - If i can get that point across by marking it as my own in a way he understands, coupled with normal training techniques (removing him from the room) he'll get the point   does anyone have any advice? I've actually had some success curbing annoying behavior be acting insulted like he does to me, but I'd really like to learn more about the territory stuff "
1014,Preparing to Leave Puppy Home Alone,"We just got a new bullmastiff puppy. He is currently 10 weeks old. The timing is great because I work from home and will only be returning to in office hours in April.  In April he will be 4 months old, is that old enough to start leaving him alone? My wife will be coming home for lunch so he will have company during lunch but for the rest of the day he will be alone.   Should we rather invest in doggy daycare until he is a bit older? I have been getting mixed messages on this topic.  Thanks,  Filipe "
1015,Fearful 3-year-old adopted cat,"We adopted a 3-year-old cute tabby cat from a local shelter 3 days ago. The shelter found her and some of her friends around a park. We don't know if she had any owner before, but she is litter trained. She is also neutered.  The problem is that when we try to approach her gently, she runs away and finds hiding spot. If she is cornered when we are approaching her, she starts hissing. During the day she looks relaxed but we can not really interact with her.  She seems very fearful and some time might make her a bit more relaxed, but she is not even reacting to food. We put out some for her which she eats during the night. Although she ate the premium alu-packaged stuff before our eyes.  For the time being, she is only allowed to be in our living room. although she stays only in one corner and the shelves next to it.  Do you guys have any suggestion, that we can do in order to fasten the relaxation of this poor girl? Or how much should we wait until we can pet her? "
1016,Is it safe for cat to eat poisonous spider?,"In my home some small jumping spiders as well as those small spiders with long legs hanging from from spider net are there.

1017,Existing puppy (18 months) scared of new rescue (between 2 and 4 years) - will this stop?,"We have an 18 month old male pug puppy, he's a very friendly, happy go lucky fella. Loves, people, and other dogs when were out on walks. We recently had the opportunity to rescue a female pug between 2 and 4 years old. She has an elongated soft palate, so she is a little louder when breathing and she can be quite 'bossy' or 'dominant' around the younger pup, even though she's new to the house. As a result, the puppy seems quite scared of her. Drops toys if she comes near, will back away if she comes near, just generally seems a little freaked when she is around. He will have a sniff every now and again but no longer than a few seconds and no further interaction.  We've tried a few things, but I won't mention these to discourage any bias. We really hope this will stop, we hoped they'd be best buddies but the reality has been quite the opposite. Will this change? Will she relax dominance wise and will he grow the confidence to enjoy her company? "
1018,When are dachshunds' nails unhealthily long?,"This dachshund's nails are cut every 2 months by a professional. Allegedly it is going to be taken to a session in a matter of days. Its owner is very confident that there there is no 'nail problem' whatsoever; 'this is a digger type dog'. It is kept ~23h25min of a day indoors, 10-17 minutes a day is the usual time that is spent walking on concrete or rocky surface.  Here are a couple of pictures:        So do you think that the nails are way too long and should have been cut a month ago? The consensus on the internet as I've seen is that dachshunds' nails should be cut every 2-3 weeks and that their nails should not touch the ground, especially not make clicking noises. (Clicking noises are heard for a month or so...) May there be health problems in the future, or may there be already?  I'd appreciate if you'd mention where where your experience/expertise from. "
1019,"Cat sneezes constantly, and noticeably congested, for 3 months","My calico cat sneezes multiple times a day, releasing mucus. This began about three months ago. She is also audibly congested. Does she have an allergy? A cold that won't go away? Perhaps this seems obvious, but do I need to take her to a vet? She's very skittish.  "
1020,Why would a cat ask to play all the time and how to satisfy her?,"I have a quite energetic, 1.5 year old female cat, who used to live outside until 6 months old.   We get along nicely, and I try to have play sessions with her 2-3 times a day for at least 5 minutes - it's usually two 5-minute and two 10-minute sessions every day. I have to note that these are not on a fixed schedule; the cat does not know when to expect playtime at all, and a couple of times per month there might be a day with no play sessions at all.  The thing is - no matter how much she plays, it never seems to be enough for her! This makes me a little skeptical:   Is she getting the fun, exercise and stimulation she needs? Can there be other reasons why a cat would like to play much more than usual?  There already is quality and variety in her playtime, so I doubt that new toys are the answer here. Is it possible at all that a new kitten in the household would help her? Could she just be lonely and looking for ways to spend more time with me? Any other ideas what this behaviour could indicate?  Here's some more info on her playing and asking-for-play behavior:   I often alternate between toys from session to session, give her challenges, encourage her to run around chasing the toy and the such. She also likes to play hide-and-seek and peek-a-boo, although string toys are her favorite. She loves it all (sometimes she even purrs while playing). Most of the play sessions are very energetic.  I've never seen the slightest indication that she gets tired when playing. Sometimes she hides and waits for the moment the toy is not moving before attacking, but I believe that's just good hunting technique she learned while outside, not an indication of tiredness. The more often I play with her, the more playtime she's going to ask for. If I don't play with her for a couple of days, she might not ask at all, although she'll still engage joyfully as soon as I grab a toy. How she asks for playtime: Trying to lure me to the living room when I'm not there by meowing expectantly, coming to my door then running away, showing/bringing me a toy, rubbing on my legs to get my attention before making play gestures with her paws, lying on her back while playing with an imaginary toy hanging above her. She does not get aggressive when not played with, and is not aggressive in general. She never breaks things or attacks clothes/furniture or other items. She always respects my privacy; won't wake me up at all, won't bother me again if she's tried and I'm busy. Will only try to call out for me a couple of times and stop if she fails. Playing is the activity we spend the most time together on: she does like to be petted, but less frequently than your average house-cat, and does not usually like to be held.  "
1021,What remaining equipment do I need for a marine aquarium?,"I want to convert my soft water aquarium into marin aquarium, but before I do that I want to make sure I have all the required equipments and few critical equipments in spare as well.  I already have the following equipment:   The aquarium I've is a glass aquarium of 220 US gallons (Which is right now a soft water aquarium) I have a very good skills of maintaining all types of soft water fish and now I want to make a nice marin aquarium with reef. As of now I have 2 SUNSUN External Canister Filter (Model HW-304A)  300W automatic Heaters I have a bear tank (No gravells or stones at all) Wave maker sunsun JVP-101A quantity 1 Filtration media in sunsun filter is below:  1) Mechanical spange  2) Active Carbon bag of 1 KG  3) Ceramic Bio Rings 2 KG 5 Air pumps 13W UV filter of sunsun again LED lighting which is normal LED lighting which is used for home use and not for aquariums :P   Am I missing any essential equipment? Is there anything recommended that I don't already have? Should I have spares of anything?  One very important thing that I know I am missing is Skimmer and the water testing kit. I use water provided by the government here. I want to ensure that I don't have to do the maintenance now and then I would prefer to do it once in 5 weeks. Right now I do it once in 6 months and I do not have cloudy water or dirty water at all.  Budget is not a constraint for me I am ready to spend around a 1 to 2 thousand USDs. "
1022,Why do you need to change the water in your fish tank?,"There are several posts here about the right ways and wrong ways to change water in your fish tank, and all the ways it can go wrong.  Why do you need to change it?  It would seem unlikely that water would wear-out, you need to manage the PH and actively filter to keep it clean, if you are managing it effectively why would you need to change it? "
1023,Can wet food cause gingivitis to cats?,"I have just adopted a six month old ginger cat. I have never had any pets before. The rescue from which I adopted the cat, made its cats eat a lot of dry food and about a can of wet food per day (half in morning and rest at night). It doesn't drink any water from the water bowl. I have read the answers to the question below  How do I motivate a cat to drink more water?  The accepted answer mentions to feed my cat wet food instead of dry food. The lady at the rescue told not to feed a lot of wet food as it might cause gingivitis. Is it true? Can wet food cause gingivitis to cats? "
1024,How do I stop my Red Nose Pitbull from barking at my neighbors cat?,"My neighbors have a cat that comes into our backyard at night to sleep (so cute) but my meanie Red Nose always goes over to bark at the cat. I understand my dog is trying to protect us but this cat hasn't done anything to cause my Red Nose to bark.  I have heard Pitbulls of any kind can easily get very aggressive when people or something bothers them. I've been looking over the internet for someone who had this happen to them like me, but I see only those who talk about how their kids got bitten and things. My dog is beginning to become more and more aggressive every time the cat comes around to sleep in my yard.  How do I stop my Red Nose Pitbull from barking at my next door neighbors cat? Is there a safe way or solution to introducing my dog to my neighbors cat? "

How do I stop this behavior and how do I reintroduce her to carpet, or dogs and another cat??   Thank you!  "
1026,Would flying stress my cats more than driving?,"In a few months I will be moving across the US with 2 cats (The female is introverted and will slink away to hide when the unexpected happens. The male is a lot more outgoing, but can be unexpectedly skittish.)  At the moment I am debating between flying and driving them.  My assumption of the pro's and cons of each type of trip are:  Fly   Pro: Shorter duration: 2 flights over 7 hours Con: Higher stress environment: noisy, bustling airports and planes Con: Once the trip starts, it cannot be stopped. Con: More expensive: Need 1 booked person and $125 per cat   Drive   Pro: Lower stress: It's just like a really long trip to the vet Pro: Can take a time out from traveling if needed. Pro: Cheaper: Just Gas and hotel rooms Con: A much longer duration: 26 hours of driving spread over 3 days   My assumption is that the driving will suck for me (but I have the time to do it), but will be better for the cats (they can better handle the lower level but longer duration stress).    Is this a valid assumption about the levels of stress of each type of trip, and in general how cats react to such stress?  Note that while Travelling with cat by plane is great for tips on that mode of transportation, my question is more about comparing flying with driving.  And Is it feasible to take cat on a 1400 mile, 21+ hour road trip? is great for the driving part.      Update   After speaking to our vet (who knows our cats and their personalities) we have decided to go with the flying option.  Our vet will also prescribe anti-anxiety drugs for the trip (even though the airlines say not to dose the cats up), and has recommended that we do multiple trials of the drugs well prior to the flights in order to gauge how much of the drug is needed on the day.

1027,Losing Fish Though Levels Test Fine,"We have a 40 gallon tank with an established Nitrogen Cycle.  We went several months with just 1 Three-Striped Cory and 3 Gold Dust Mollies.    The tank has its own filter that came with it, rated for its size, a heater, gravel substrate, 3 large rocks, a piece of driftwood and half a dozen or so live plants.  Recently I purchased 6 more corydoras as they are meant to be kept in shoals.  In the past three weeks 4 of them have died without any indication of stress or disease.  They were all dark, not too thin, foraging and swimming regularly. Levels have been tested regularly and nitrogen cycle has been in expected levels, ph and kh are ideal, and the water is just a touch hard (due to the area).   We recently added 4 more Gold Dust Mollies and 2 Tangerine Mollies, and after about 5 days one of the Tangerines died, again with no signs other than little fits of wiggling (possible symptom?).  One of the female Gold Dust Mollies from the original bunch is roughly 3x the size of any of the others and very aggressive in hunting down both flakes and pellets at feeding time, and we're worried other fish may not be getting enough to eat.  Is this possible?  How might we get food in so the corys can forage without her eating it all?  Is there something else we might consider?  Edit Measured Using API 5 - 1 Test Strips   Nitrate - 20ppm  Nitrite - 0ppm pH - 7.0 KH - 120ppm GH - 180ppm  "
1028,Limping cat - bone tumor?,"One of my cats unexpectedly started limping about 2 weeks ago.  She was fine one day, then the next day she was heavily limping on her left hind leg and within another day or so she would not even attempt to step on it, simply jumping on one hind leg keeping the other close to her belly. If it's important, she is around 12-13 years old (she's a rescue so nobody really knows for sure).  As it was Christmas, it was impossible to get to the vet on the day, so I took her to a vet as soon a I could a couple of days later. They did an x-ray and afterwards the vet told me that from the x-ray it's most likely that she had a torn ligament in her knee.  I took the cat home along with a 2 weeks' worth of anti-inflamatory medication. They said a surgery could be considered but only after the cat would loose some weight. Otherwise, just give her a lot of peace and quite, make sure she doesn't need to jump/run/etc - and it would heal on its own over a period of a couple of months or maybe a bit more.  A few days later I got a phone call from the vet that they were reviewing the x-rays again with another vet and that other vet commented that there may be a bit of bone loss in her leg, which means that she's got a bone tumor and her leg would need to be amputated to spare her constant pain. The vet emphasised that such tumor is usually benign.  Now, this doesn't seem to add up for me. If it were a bone loss caused by bone tumor, it would be gradual; instead the limping came on abruptly: everything was perfectly fine one day and she was not stepping on the leg the next day. Also, she doesn't seem at all to be in pain.  Her behaviour hasn't changed other than less movement.  She is still happily eating and drinking.  I'm taking her to the vet again tomorrow - they want to do a biopsy of the tissue.  Yet, I'm now suspicious about the whole thing.  Obviously, if there's no other way to save the cat, we'll go for the amputation, but I don't want to do it just because ""whatever"". The vet stated it almost in passing, the same way I would state that I need to buy some cat food.  My question is: how likely is this really to be a bone loss due to tumor vs. what else can it be? Even if this is a tumor, is there any way to avoid amputating the leg?  In regards to her weight, for her size, the ideal weight is about 5 kg. She is currently 6.7 kg. She was abused early in her life, then taken away from her owner by RSPCA and I adopted her from RSPCA. When I brought her home, she was under 3 kg.  Despite trying to control her diet, she quickly gained weight (she'd go outside and catch mice or birds and eat them) and got to 8.5 kg within a year.  We've managed to loose about 2 kg since then.  Overall, she's lived with me for about 10 years or so. "

1031,training a dog to herd,"I am interested to learn how to train a dog (of course of specific breeds) to herd (ducks, other animals). Is there a guide, book, or research results available? I already made a cursory search in google. The popular search results are wikihow and blogposts. I am looking for a more scientific approach, hence I am asking if anyone knows research papers, or journals, or books.  I am interested to know what methods are used to train:    Are dogs given commands, rewards? During the training process, are dogs shown a demonstration? (which they can imitate later?) Or are dogs 'left to figure it out'? (and given a series of punishment/rewards for tasks that are not done/completed)   Any definitive sources are well appreciated!   thanks "
1032,What substrate/base should I use for this small fish pond?,"I have bought a property that has a tiny decorative pond with waterfall and sizeable filter.  It looks as though a larger pond use to be in its place.   I plan to install this product: [website]I then plan to plant a mix of oxygenators and decorative plants (lilies) and then stock very lightly with some small, hardy goldfish.    Can anyone recommend what I should line the floor of the pond with? i.e. should I have part gravel, part soil then let it settle?  I am guessing that common garden soil and then small gravel to a thin depth is all that's required and then let the water clear before planting and adding fish "
1033,Why does my cat only bite my partner?,"My girlfriend and I have a 1 year old (or slightly younger) orange tabby that we adopted a little over a month ago. He is a good, easy-going cat overall, but he sometimes bites my girlfriend, either on the hand or face, for seemingly doing nothing. She’ll be petting him and he’ll want to bite her hand. Or, he will willingly come to HER while we’re laying in bed, cuddle, be loving, and then bites her face hard. He NEVER does this with me.   I should point out that I work from home, so I spend the most time with him. I feed him, I clean out his litter, I play with him. She will occasionally play with him and pet him when she comes home.   I was thinking maybe this is the reason why he bites only her. She has recently started to feed him and give him his treats whenever she is home but, so far he is still biting. Almost every day. I hope she just needs to continue to feed him and play with him for his behavior to change (We just started, afterall) But I worry it may be something else? Anybody have ideas or suggestions?  "
1034,Can rabbits eat banana leaves?,"A recent answer said:     as an alternative source of fiber, you can also give your rabbit banana leaves.   I did a quick google search and found a few blog posts by house rabbit parents who have feed their bunnies banana leaves. A couple of posts suggest that it should be limited do to high levels of some thing that may not be good for rabbits.  When I looked for scientific references I found a diet with 40% banana leaves can be feed for 105 days without adverse effects.  But this is for production rabbits not pet rabbits.       Abstract : An experiment is described in which 40 rabbits, 12 weeks old, were fed on diets containing 0, 20, 40 or 60% banana leaves (DM basis) for 105 days. Growth rate was highest for 40% banana leaves while DM intake was reduced on 60% banana leaves. It is suggested that rabbits can be fed up to 40% banana leaves without adverse effects on growth, feed intake and physiology. source   Clearly they can eat some banana leaves, but is at a healthy form of fiber in the long term (8-12 years)? Do banana leaves contain any substances that should be moderated?  "
1035,Neighbourhood cat claiming our home as her territory,"I live in a neighbourhood which is inhabited by a fairly large number of cats. One in particular, a smokey grey female around 3-4 years old, is very friendly, to the point where she casually strolls into mine and other neighbours' home without much care for other pets. She also gets along well with other neighbourhood cats, she was on good terms with my cat and they'd often playfully chase each other around.  Sadly we lost our cat to a road collision at the beginning of December. The regular visits and attention-seeking from this smokey grey cat played a huge part in helping us to grieve and feel better over the Christmas period. However, I'm starting to feel that she's starting to make herself a bit too welcome in our home. We let her in for about 5-10 minutes at a time, during which she's rubbing her head against any corner she can find (claiming the house as her own), and wanting a big fuss from us. Whenever we return home she hears the jingle of our keys and immediately rushes to our door.  We're currently looking to rehome a new cat (not her, we know where she lives and who her owners are :) ) and we're very unsure as to how any new cat would react to this neighbourhood cat inviting herself in. We'd be keeping any new cat away from the front door, we wouldn't be letting him/her outside until s/he's settled in and willing to return home. However it's inevitable that the two will meet indoors at some point, so should we start to discourage her from marking her scent in our house? Or should we use a gentle introduction plan for her and our new cat? "
1036,Suggestions for a leash reactive dog who reacts to random people,"Does anyone have any suggestions for helping my dog get over her leash reactivity towards people? My newly adopted rescue dog gets triggered by dogs and people on walks. We've been working on this for a couple months, and she's slowly getting better about dogs (she can almost always handle them across the street now) but seems to be getting worse about people.  The thing is, she's fine with about 95% of people, and then will randomly get stiff at random people. If she were just reactive towards people with hats, or elderly asian folks or bald men or something, it would be easy...get her around a bunch of those folks, and show her they're good. However, it seems completely unpredictable who she'll react to. She reacts to people equally across all genders, colors and atire. She's a bit more reactive near our apartment, but other than that there's no discernible pattern. I fear my strategy of asking her to sit, sweet talking her and giving her treats when a person approaches might actually be contributing to her people reactivity since because I can't find a pattern, I do this for all people, even though she likely won't react to them.  Any ideas for helping my dog who's only reactive to occasional random people?  EDIT: By reactive towards people/dogs I mean:While I'm holding the leash and walking her posture will stiffen. She then lunges at them barking loudly and without pause. When her posture stiffens she'll stop responding to my 'look' command that she follows very well when not triggered. She'll sometimes sit if i ask her while she's lunging and barking, but she'll still bark aggressively "
1037,How to know 2 day old puppies are getting enough milk?,"So my dog, a 5 year old German Shepherd, had 8 puppies 2 days ago. She delivered normally and, from the little that I know, they all seemed healthy. They were crying right after birth, and all.of them manoeuvred their way to suck milk. But since then (48hrs) we have noticed that the puppies sleeping a bit too much compared to their first day. We felt like something was wrong so we checked our dog to see if nipples were producing milk properly and we found that on pressing them only the last two (near the hind legs)  released very little milk, and the rest released nothing. Also we saw in some other dogs the milk sacs are usually very swollen after birth but for my dog only the last two are swollen and the rest are very little if not completely flat.  Is this normal for German shepherds?  And if not then should we consider dog formula milk for the puppies? Also is the formula milk safe and healthy for the pups? How do we tell if the puppies are healthy and feeding properly?   Honestly I'm really worried and would appreciate your inputs!!  P.S.: my vet is out of town for Easter holidays and won't be back for the next four days so yeah really need your advice for now!  "

1040,"How do I get my dog to stop eating, literally, everything?","I have a pure-bred Catahoula dog. He is 80lbs and just turned 1yr old. I can't give him bedding because he eats it. He literally eats everything his bedding (he pooped out the bedding all over the yard, his rope toys, he eats them (can't give those to him any more), I even tried a tough rubber mat for him to lay on - nope,  he ate part of it before I took it away.  He eats regularly his dog food, he gets plenty of water and regular exercise. He isn't alone because I have another dog that he also plays with, as well as 2 cats (such a happy blended family that I have). But I can't get him to stop eating Everything. I can't turn my back for even one minute - it is getting to be too much. Lately I have had 2 episodes where there was explosive diarrhoea from his crate - he sleeps in there. It is more like a giant pen - but I can't trust him out in the house overnight not to eat things, so I put him in his pen overnight, as well as my other dog- she goes into her crate too (so they are both treated the same) but he loves her crate, he sleeps, and naps in his pen during the day too when he is out and about - so I don't think it has anything to do with that. What do I do?  We walk him 2x a day, we take him for hikes a few times a week as well, we play with him daily. What more could it be? He poops random objects. He has torn apart all of his toys, we have gotten the big king toys to chew on and put treats inside for him to play with for a while. I know this is like a run on, but I want you to know that I have done almost everything I can think of to keep him from eating anything that is in his sight. "
1041,Cat's fur is sticky and has dandruff,"Whenever I pet my cats back theres always dandruff towards her lower back. Also, my hands get really sticky after petting her. Why is this? Is this normal? "
1042,Life of dog after loosing her companion from birth,"I had two German shepards. Daisy and Dalmi. Daisy was Dalmi's Mother. From birth Dalmi was living with a companion, Her mother, Daisy. Though me and my family is also a part of their life, still I think while two dogs stays with each other all the time, that plays a different role in their life. Daisy passed away last Tuesday. As of now I have not find any visible trauma in Dalmi. But can this incident and satying without Daisy, harm in anyway to Dalmi? How should I keep her happy and keep her away from any kind of trauma?

1043,"Testing for external factors contributing to a cat's loss, keeping other cat safe","Very long story, as short as possible (intro first, questions at bottom):  Two cats. In mid-February cat C (female, indoor, 3 yr, spayed), presented with:   Thick, excessive drooling. Mild appetite loss. Constipation (somewhere between moderate and severe).   Cat C also has a lifetime history of snoring / noisy breathing from the sinus area, mild eye discharge, and heavy water consumption, but generally appears healthy and active.  Around that same time cat V had a very, very small, odd, brown discharge from the corner of his mouth (he was always prone to drooling, having an overbite), which at first I thought was a bit of food but it kept returning after cleaning (however, he was also due for dental work and was exhibiting signs of dental problems, eating from the side in particular). Cats were isolated, cat V appeared to recover, with the discharge discontinuing within a week. Cat C was taken in for dental worth, signs of mild gum infection noticed, teeth cleaned, given antibiotics for 2 weeks. Condition cleared up, cause of constipation remained a mystery.  Also starting around that time cat V (male, indoor, 16 yr, neutered):   Appetite began decreasing, slowly at first. Then stopped eating entirely about 2.5 weeks ago. About 2 weeks ago presented with symptoms highly resembling lymphoma:   Enlarged lymph node (3.5 cm) Slightly enlarged spleen. Severe anemia (lack of rbc production determined). Unusual (but inconclusive) size distribution of lymphocytes.  V became jaundiced then his calcium levels suddenly plummeted last week and, sadly, there were no remaining options and we decided to put him down. We were never able to get a positive lab confirmation of a cancer (three lymphatic samples and a spleen sample via needle aspirate + lots of bloodwork, V was not stable enough for a biopsy) although it remained high on our theory list.   Cat V has a history of IBD since January, but otherwise healthy with no signs of liver or kidney problems, no signs of pancreatitis, no signs of diabetes. He had a mild heart murmor and mild HCM since birth, inconsequential. V had become severely hypokalemic and had a benign but rare aldosterone-secreting adrenal tumor successfully removed in January and made a full recovery, we determined his IBD had been masked by the tumor's released hormones. His liver was slightly enlarged but recovered after the tumor was removed. He was on 5mg prednisolone daily and biweekly B12 injections since. V also had poor coat regrowth since last August (possibly explained by tumor or vitamin deficiencies) and his black coat was turning orange since December (which we explained through salivary staining but could have other factors). We were 99.99999% confident that his lymphoma[-like] illness, even if cancer, was not directly related to the previous adrenal tumor.  Now, Cat C's appetite has fluctuated greatly in the past 2 weeks (mild - moderate appetite loss) as has her activity level (ranging from mild lethargy to normal), but there are too many variables to know if it is significant: Loss of other cat, the weather has been significantly warmer (and the presence of potentially disease-carrying flying insects adds more potential complications to this whole thing as well), my own stress/anxiety/depression regarding loss of other pet, etc. I do not know if it is cause for concern or not.  Both cats received yearly rabies and feline distemper vaccines, and C was negative for FIV in 2014. Both cats are indoor and have not been outside in at least 3 years.  Additionally, around March, I began noticing water quality problems in my apartment (sharp rise in amount of unknown sediment in water), but it's highly possible, especially after talking to neighbors, that the water here has never been that great. Inaccurate home test kits revealed no interesting info except for a slightly elevated copper level that was still well below the EPA guidelines for humans. I switched both cats (and myself) to bottled water.  I am leaving out a lot for brevity.  My concern now is for both the safety of cat C as well as any other cats that I may bring into the house in the future. I have no idea if C's mystery illness was linked to V's mystery illness, and I have no idea if water quality is related to any of this, and I have no idea what is relevant vs. noise. It's a complete mystery all around. The dots are not connected.  What this all boils down to is:    Questions   Communicable Diseases: C is going to the vet this week to get tested to see if she is a carrier for FeLV, FIV, FIP, and feline distemper. Given her mystery illness and the two month timeline and hypothesizing that there is a link to V's condition, what else should I have her tested for? Is there any communicable disease that could cause drooling, appetite loss, and constipation on initial infection, with the potential to become asymptomatic in some cats, that can also lead to anemia / severe inflammatory response, or greatly increase the risk of a cancer? Chronic Toxicity: I haven't sent my water to a proper lab. Ignoring C's illness, given V's decline, and hypothesizing that chronic exposure to something in the water over a period of up to 3 years is linked to V's condition, what could do this and what should I test for? Are there signs of exposure I can look for in C? From my research, copper, zinc, aluminum seem to be on the top of my list. Unfortunately we never took any samples from V's liver since it wasn't showing any signs of inflammation and the bile ducts were clear on ultrasound, so it's not possible to know if he was accumulating any minerals or heavy metals. It's my understanding that we can also take hair samples from C to look for accumulation of toxic substances. Note, however, that it has been almost 2 months since I took both cats off the tap water. However, long term exposure, or V's sensitivity due to his age or perhaps his IBD, could have made him more sensitive, or it was too late to prevent any damage.   The whole situation has been incredibly complicated, with many factors whose relations, if any, remain unclear, and many occurrences with multiple reasonable explanations.  "
1044,"New cat only licks sauce / gravy from wet food and ignores the chunks, but eats dry food without issues","My girlfriend and I adopted a shelter cat, unknown age, but we were told she was rather old (10 to 17 years?). Was very shy in the beginning and hid under the bed or in my wardrobe. But purred when petted. Now she has fully accepted us as their servants, always comming and sitting on our laps when we return from work and get comfortable on the couch. She's not hiding anymore and roams the flat freely. Hopefully we can let her out into the garden soon.  Her eating habits are rather un-cat-ish though: She eats very little, most of the food goes to the trashcan when her bowls (yes several, we don't really know what food she was used to) are renewed. She eats dry food, we see her eating from it, and sometimes we can hear her munching when we are in bed. She drinks water sufficiently. From the wet food she only licks sauce / gravy and ignores the chunks (maybe she eats a few chunks, but merely as a by-product of gravy-licking) (Maybe I should write a letter to whiskas asking for a bucket of their gravy.)  Is my cat behaving normal? Should I be worried she might eat too little? (She seems not enfeebled: jumps on the bed and on the couch, and put her claws to the carpet) "
1045,Why is my cat so attached to me? Is there anything wrong?,"I have three cats. My oldest is fifteen years old, and lately I've noticed that he's beginning to get really attached to me. On an abnormal level.   It began when we moved. Previous to moving, the cat had definitely preferred me, but nothing out of the ordinary. When we moved for the first time in his life, I put him on my bed and sat with him until he felt ready to explore the house. We stayed in that house for a year, and I noticed that he preferred to stay on the bed more than usual during that time.   We moved again a year later, and I put him on my bed again and sat with him. His behavior increased so that now he sleeps almost nowhere but the bed, and constantly wants me to sit on the bed with him, so that he can lie on me. He's become more and more persistent about this over time.   Previous to moving, the cat had liked to sit on/sleep with me in bed. Nothing abnormal. But now it is at the level where he wants to do it constantly. There is no exaggeration. Constantly. If I don't sit on the bed, he will sit on it and meow loudly at me (remember I'm sitting right there at my computer), until one of us gives in. If he gives up, he will go down the hall meowing loudly, and come back later. He seems content if I put him on my lap while I work, but this is difficult for me to do, as I need to type.   Additionally, the cat shows worrying signs if I'm gone for more than a day. Usually this is just meowing as he looks for me and ultimately sleeping, but recently I was gone for three days, coming back only in the evening and leaving early the next day. The cat quickly lost weight, and I believe he stayed in my room the entire time. He seemed perfectly normal, otherwise.   Why is my cat acting this way? Is it something I should be worried about?   Additional details:    My cat has a hyper thyroid condition, which has always caused him to vomit/regurgitate a lot. He is on a medication for it (and has been for over a year), which was working, but now doesn't seem to be having quite as much effect. The reason I mention this is because he vomited a lot the first two days I was gone (this is NOT abnormal). This might be why he lost weight... but he hasn't lost that much before when vomiting. All the vomit was in my room, which is why I think he stayed there. (The medication is not to blame; he's been on it for a year)  My cat has dry itchy skin which is causing him to pull out his fur, which has caused us to put a soft cone on him. He's been wearing cones for a year, and seems completely unaware of and unaffected by them.  The behavior described above is not new. It's been there for the majority of my cat's life. It is simply now more exaggerated than it has ever been. This change was gradual, and not sudden.  I do not believe this is a fear issue. The cat moves around the house freely, often sleeping under the dining room table or on the living room floor. Sometimes he sleeps in my mother's office, as she is usually the one who feeds him. He generally tries to sit on my bed with me first though.  I live with my family, so there are other people and two other cats for him to interact with. There is plenty of food, and he is eating fine.   "
1046,Am I causing two cats to fight?,We recently started feeding two stray cats in my apartment complex and initially they all behaved. However for the past two days one cat is trying to pick a fight and chase the other one away (the smaller one). The bigger cat is almost always near where we feed them. The smaller one actually disappeared for two days and returned yesterday where the big cat again tried to chase him up a tree and then stood there waiting at the bottom. They don't fight while eating. The bigger one typically eats faster and then goes after the smaller one. Am I causing this in some way? Are they competing over food? We usually give plenty to both of them. We used to keep a sizable bowl of dry food for them to nibble on when they are hungry again but it looked like nobody ate from it a lot and we stopped keeping that.  
1047,Nitrogen cycle for new fish tank,"I recently bought a fish tank. I googled about basics for setting up a fish tank. Almost every webpages help me to understand how important the nitrogen cycle is for a healthy fish tank. So I decided to learn about how to do nitrogen cycle and googled allot from the past few days. But by reading many articles, I am really getting confused about the entire cycle process and also many of the beginners like me don't know the correct process. Anyway I decided  to start cycling from this weekend with the knowledge I got from different sources. But I just need to ask you guys that the procedure am going to do is correct?. Please advice me or correct me if I am going to do this in wrong way. I just explained the cycling process am going to do in a overall view below.  Day 1:  I am setting up my tank with air pump, filter, heater, gravel, substrate, plants and a pH level tester. I have API ammonia, nitrite, nitrate and pH test kit and water conditioner. I will add 8 small guppies. I will feed them a little everyday which they can eat in 2 or 3 minutes.   Day 4: I will do 20℅water change (won't clean gravel or plants, just do top water change) without testing the ammonia level.  Day 8:  I will test the ammonia level first before changing water. If ammonia is below 1ppm, I will leave the water as it is without changing. If ammonia is above 1ppm,  I will do a water change by 40℅ and clean 1/4 th of the gravel or substrate and gentle clean filter.  Day 12: I will do 20℅water change without testing the ammonia level.  Day 16: I will test ammonia and nitrite levels before water change. If ammonia and nitrite levels are below 1ppm, I will leave the water as it is without changing. If the ammonia and nitrite levels are above 1ppm, I will do a 40℅ water change and will clean 1/4 th of gravel or substrate and gentle filter clean.  Day 20: I will do 20℅water change without testing the ammonia and nitrite level.  Day 24: I will test ammonia, nitrite and nitrate levels before water change. If ammonia and nitrite is below 1ppm and nitrate is below 10ppm, I won't make any water change. But if ammonia or nitrite is above 1ppm, I will do a 40℅ water change and clean 1/4 th of gravel and substrate and plants and gentle filter clean.   And I will continue the below process in every four days till ammonia and nitrite levels reach 0ppm.   Continuation Process: I will test the ammonia, nitrite and nitrate levels before water change. If ammonia and nitrite is below 1ppm, I will leave the water without changing. If it's above 1ppm, will do 40℅ water change and clean some portion of gravel, substrate and plants.   I am not much aware about the nitrate test. What should I do if the nitrate level goes above 10 or 20 ppm?. Should I need to change water?.  Is high level nitrates harmful for fish?  And also not aware much about the pH tester. Do I need to test pH level also along with the ammonia, nitrite and nitrate test and add pH controller agent based on the pH result?  Any advice will be helpful for people like me who are beginners in this hobby :) "
1048,My boyfriend's dog hate me... help! Warning! Long post,"OK, let me preface this by saying I have never been a dog person. I think they are cute, and enjoy playing with people's dogs at their homes, but I did not/do not want one. I'm slightly allergic to them, and far too much of a neat freak to have them. That being said, my boyfriend moved in with me about 4 months ago. His female wiener dog had been staying in the country with his mom and her male wiener dog. When we would visit my boyfriend's mom's house, Lady (his dog) would jump into his lap and stare me down while he pet her. I never paid her much mind, I knew she probably just missed him. She would sit by me and let me pet her too.   All of that changed when we brought her home with us. When my boyfriend asked me if he could bring her home, knowing my aversion to having dogs in my home, I asked 3 questions:     Is she potty trained? I just installed $6,000 carpet in my house. The previous owners had let their multiple dogs use their carpet as a urinal and the carpet had to go. Does she eat underwear or shoes? This was a concern for me because I have some very expensive shoes and I had a puppy when I was younger that would drag out our entire hamper to eat our underwear. Is she aggressive towards kids? I have a 6 year old daughter.   His answers were yes - she never uses the restroom in the house, no - she never ate underwear even as a puppy, nor shoes, and no- she's very good with kids.   Here's my problem.... it's MY house... the dog thinks SHE owns it. Within 2 weeks of living here, she ate 4 pairs of my panties, I found them in shreds under my bed. and she peed in my carpet twice... on the floor in my room on my side of the bed only. Now, before the typical ""put your underwear in a basket"" ""pick up your panties"" comments rain down... my basket is a tall basket with a lid. She's a mini-doxen. My panties SHOULD be secure. Next comment I'm sure I'll get, ""Shut your bedroom door."" I do. My boyfriend however is bad about leaving it open despite me telling him to shut it so she doesn't eat my panties.  The next issue I keep running into is her possessiveness over my boyfriend, and I've noticed as of lately, it's going into possessiveness over my daughter, his son, my sister, my brother.... basically anyone that's over except for me and my mom. A friend of mine with a lot of experience with dogs said that she's staking her ""Claim."" She's trying to ""claim"" my boyfriend, the kids, basically anyone that will let her. My mom and I are both very dominate female personalities, she's never tried ""claiming"" either of us. My friend said that her eating my underwear, especially since she's not a puppy and never did it to my bf's ex-wife (who she apparently didn't like either), in addition to her peeing on the carpet on my side of the bed is a way to try to show her claim to my territory and dominance over me. My friend said that I had to show I was dominate over her.   I didn't believe my friend until I noticed that she'd be laying down somewhere, and if she saw me walking in the direction of my boyfriend, whether I was going to him or not, she'd dash by me and jump into the seat next to him or into his lap and stare me down. Previously during this behavior, the bf would laugh and say ""aw, she loves me."" and I would just shake my head at her and continue what I was doing. After reading about ""Small Dog Syndrome"" and ""Claiming"", I realized that was the way she was asserting dominance over me and that my friend had been right.   So, now when she does that, whether I'm going to sit by my bf or not, I pick her up, set her in the floor, and take my place beside my bf to show her I'm the dominate female in the house. She then ate a pair of my boyfriend's underwear on 2 separate occasions once I started asserting my dominance in the house. My friend said that she was probably mad at him for letting me ""take her spot"". She also rolls over and bears her belly to me. My bf said that it's her submitting to me, but I've read that studies show it's also a strategic move to attack and protect itself at the same time. She doesn't do this with anyone else in the house. Last week, I was trying to put her outside to pee because she had been kenneled all day from us being at work. She jumped up in the chair and stared at me, so I went to pick her up to put her outside. I did NOT pick her up around her belly... but SHE PEED ON ME!!!! I was furious! I put her outside, cleaned up, and called my boyfriend immediately. He laughed and said, ""You scared the piss out of her! She's scared of you!"" She has no reason to be scared of me. I don't hit her. I feed her, I give her water, I let her outside. But I have rules. I don't let her in the kitchen when I'm cooking unless I call her in. And I don't allow her to sniff around the table at dinner time. Also, if she hasn't had a bath recently or stinks, I don't let her on the furniture. I don't put up with begging when we eat either. And in light of her proclivity for peeing in my room and eating my panties, I have said she's not allowed in bedrooms or bathrooms. She's used to having free-reign. Now, she rolls over when I walk into the room, and pees on herself. It's been happening a lot... and quite frankly, it's driving me crazy. I want to get rid of the dog, but my boyfriend loves her. I have tried playing with her, I give her treats, I pet her/rub her belly/scratch her ears...... but nothing works... My boyfriend says ""Maybe she senses you don't like dogs."" Maybe... but I love him, so I'm really trying with her.   I've also been told I should lean over her when she rolls over, not on her, just over her, so that she recognizes me as the dominant female, and that while I do this, to stare her down until she looks away. I did this. It worked... but that's when the rolling over and pissing herself issue started. I know she hates me, honestly, the feeling is mutual after her acting this way, but I'm at my wits end on what to do about her.... any advice will be helpful. I'm not trying to incite a riot of ""you're mean because you don't like dogs."" comments... everybody is different, everybody has their preferences, my preference just happens to be a pet-free home. I'm really trying with this dog... she's just always been the alpha female in the house, and I don't play that game. I truly need help with what to do about this. I'm not willing to roll over for her, if you catch my meaning, just to make her easier to get along with.   My friend I mentioned earlier stated that we're having these issues because she has staked a claim on my bf and may consider him ""her person or her mate"" or something. She said it's common with wiener dogs...   Please, any constructive and helpful advice is needed. I know there's going to be some backlash on this because some people won't read what I'm really trying to get at, but please, help? "
1049,Aggressive Indian Watchdog,"I am from the United States. I am partnered with a friend of mine in a small industry startup in his home village in South India.  I visit 2-3 times each year. There is a small street dog, named Taiku, at our factory who has been adopted by the facility personnel and does a wonderful job keeping of watch over the place at night.   The problem is, while he is used to the locals he is always very wary of me whenever I arrive at the factory. Whether I arrive in the company car, by foot, or on the back of my partner's motorcycle, he will threaten me as soon as he observes me by holding his ground and issuing an unending guttural growl. This happens every time I arrive, every day, each time I visit.   I am used to making peace with aggressive dogs back home who will bark and snarl when they are trying to establish ward off intruders. However, Taiku prefers a low growl and a cold stare, which we were always taught to respect as a serious warning.  Foreigners don't find themselves in this village very often and he behaves this way with anyone I bring along with me. I think it is the sight of us, perhaps our white-skinned faces, rather than our scent that puts him off, as he won't necessarily behave this way around me all the time.   For example, when I am in the office, there is usually no drama. In fact, he is currently sitting two feet away from my feet. There was one instance when he even affectionately stood between my legs. I thought at that point maybe we had made a breakthrough. I took it easy for a moment and let him do his thing, and a couple minutes later (after I was out of the range of his jaws), I got his attention by making a gentle tounge-cluck and offering my hand for him to smell. However, once he observed my face, began growling, at which point he had to be escorted out of the office.  He is very persistent in his opposition to me. He will continue to growl at me even with my partner's hand holding the scruff of his neck, or even while being confronted with a raised stick by one of the staff members, (which he otherwise respect and will submit convincingly to).  My daily arrivals are usually a fiasco of staff members dancing between us, yelling and chasing him around with a stick. I always hold my ground and calmly proceed inside. I've never reacted in fear and he's never made good on any of his threats. I'm not particularly worried about actually getting bit, but I'm wondering if there would be a more peaceful way to arrive.   Has anyone experience with a dog like this? There is never any attempt to become familiar with me, just instant, persistent aggression that seems to distract him completely from everything else around him. Is there anything I can do to make peace? "
1050,How can I comfort my dog when he is dry heaving and obsessively trying to eat leaves?,"A couple weeks ago, my dog had an episode where he was dry-heaving for a few hours. When I let him outside he obsessively and frenetically looked for certain types of dried leaves to eat (note that he couldn't eat any grass because the ground was covered with snow).  About halfway through the episode, my dog succeeded in vomiting, but it didn't stop the dry-heaving nor the obsession with eating leaves.  Eventually the episode passed and he calmed down, and there were no more symptoms.  This has now started up again.  Is there anything I can do to ease his anxiety and help him vomit when he can't find grass in the winter time?  Does letting him out to eat grass/leaves help the vomit come sooner? After he vomits, is there anything I can do to help the dry-heaving stop sooner? "
1051,How can I prevent my dog from being a racist?,"My dog has an issue with other kinds of people...specifically, Indian people (Asia).   Whenever he gets close to the vicinity of Indian people, especially when we have guests in our home, he gets very angry and extremely aggressive, even if he hasn't met them before.  With other people, like Caucasians and Latinos, he will remain extremely gentle upon first meeting them.  It seems to be only Indian people that are causing the issue. I've read that dogs are colorblind so I don't think he's discriminating based on skin color, but I suspect it may be to the smell of some people. However, I've had friends who don't smell as strong as other Indians and he still barks at them as well. This issue is isolated just for Indians for some odd reason and I don't know what's going on with him.  How can I prevent my dog from being ""racist""? Is there some sort of conditioning or training I can do to make him more receptive and more pleasant to other Indians out there?  "
1052,Is a twisted whisker (for a cat) dangerous?,One of the whiskers of my cat got twisted (I don't know how she got it).  Is it something to worry about? Is there something I can do about it? 
1053,Five gallon fish tank,"I have a ailing Betta. The man at the aquarium store sold me some meds for fungus. I think it burnt him. Now he has fin rot. Today I took out about a gallon of water and put in fresh with Prime conditioner and a bit of aqua salt. Also added Melafix per instructions. Poor thing is almost fin less, but still swimming.  Now my question is, if he pulls through I will be very happy, but if he dies, what can I do about getting the tank sanitized? I read where people use bleach water, that's a no no. Acrylic tank, I used to use salt to scrub with, but don't know if this will scratch it and I would boil rocks. What about all the plants? and the decorations? This tank cost me a lot of money setting it up and would like to be able to re use it in the future, if my little buddy does not make it. I am afraid I will transfer this disease to another fish. Opinions any one?  I am so shocked this even happened. I had many tanks before and as well as Betas, hardly lost any fish, just started back to this hobby and this happened. "
1054,My mom's cat doesn't like my cats,"I have two cats, about 1.5 years old and supposed to be brothers, but don't know if that's true =)  My mom also has a cat, she is about 8 years old, a bit bitchy was the only cat in the household since she lives there with my mum.  I tried to bring them with me when I visted her, so that they can play with each other and all that stuff. But the cat of my mum really seems to dislike to idea of the presence of other cats. She hisses and snaps at them, try to hit them and mostly go out of their way and hides somewhere until they are gone.  I have to say, although I got the two cats way to early from the owner, because she lied about the age, and I am not the most talented one in raising cats, they behave really good when we visit the other cat. They know that there is something wrong, but they aren't intimidated by her. They bow down before her, go out of her way, apporach very slowly to show her that they mean no harm, so I don't think they can do any better.  We also tried to have them together for a longer period of time, e.g. nearly two weeks when I visited my mum for the christmas holiday. But nothings changed.  Is there any way we could improve their relationship? I know, it's the same with people, sometimes you definitely don't like someone. But it would be nice if they would get along fine, that way we could give them to someone together when we want to go for holiday or visit relatives or something like that. Do you have any idea? "
1055,Will the hair of my Yorkie Terrier growth so long?,My mom got a new puppy Yorkie Terrier. I went to google and searched for Yorkie Terrier and found these pictures    Mine looks like the one on the left but he's just one month old.  I'm wondering if all Yorkies will have the same hair as adults or if I have to take special care to make it look like the second one. Or are they all different kinds of Yorkies?  Are there some tips to improve his hair for him to look like the middle one? I don't want to attempt anything I am not sure about in case I provide bad care and he ends up looking like the one on the right. 
1056,A single parakeet and an older cat - good idea?,"I have a single male 5 year old parakeet. He is very tame and friendly. I know he is unafraid of dogs, as I have had two wonder up to the cage and my bird has been very curious. In fact, I was more worried that he would bite their noses! The dogs acted more uninterested or a bit fearful of him. But dogs are dogs and not cats. haha.   I’ve had dogs all my life. My dog of 12 years passed away in 2017 and my mom (who we were still living with at the time) adopted a puppy about 3 months later. Now that we’re moved into our own place I miss that companionship of a larger animal. (My bird is great but he doesn’t like to be pet, nor can he keep my feet warm at night haha). We live in an apartment and even a small dog wouldn’t fit our lifestyle right now, but a cat would (an older, laid back cat).   My bird is housed in a cage that is about 24”x24”x30” give or take. His cage stands on a multipurpose kitchen roller cabinet thing (about 4 feet off the ground). We keep him in our living room. It fits the base of his cage perfectly with no room on any  side for an animal to perch. The cage and stand stand with the back to a wall and one side to a bookshelf. There’s no place a cat could be near it, besides the floor. During the day, I roll him to the center of the room, closer to a window to see out of, the back still facing a wall, but sides exposed.   My husband and I are looking into adopting a cat 4-6 years old, mellow and laid back. (I absolutely fell head over heels with middle age/senior cats when I volunteered at our local humane society four years ago)  He is a student online and may work part time, but as of right now he is home all day. (I work full time, but I am home at night on the weekends; I also come home for an hour during the middle of the day) He will be able to keep an eye on everyone. If we are both out we would like to keep the cat in our bedroom with the door closed (potentially locked) with everything he/she needs while we’re gone (2-3 hours at a time max). And keep the bird in our living room.   The daily dynamic would work like this: give the cat ample play time for 30 minutes or so them put him/her in our room while our bird has some fly-about time for 30 minutes. Once the bird is back in the cat will be allowed in the common area of the house again. At night I’d like to keep the cat in our bedroom with the door closed until I can be 100% certain nothing may happened during the night. However, I’m prepared to keep the cat in our room at night for the rest of its life.   I AM NOT ASKING advice on having the bird out of the cage while the cat is in the same room. That is not my intention. I am planning to never have the bird out of its cage with a cat in the room.  I AM ASKING will an older cat be interested in a bird at all? I assume it will depend on the cat itself. Will just the presence of a cat be harmful to the bird? I’m not sure how he will act since he his fine with other larger creatures than himself (i.e. dogs). I am aware that both are natural “enemies” and have read plenty of horror stories, and for good reason. I want someone to level with me and their experiences with bringing home an older cat with a bird already in the household.  We plan to keep the cat fed and preoccupied to the best of our ability so it won’t be interested. Or is this whole idea of a cat in the house a bad idea all together?   Thank you for your input! "
1057,Noisy canister not pumping,"I've had this Sunsun 304b canister for a few years now. It was very quiet originally but in the last few years has gotten noisy.  And then two weeks ago it stopped pumping suddenly making a loud rattling noise.  The intake pipe isn't clogged, and the impeller seems to be intact.  While trying to figure out how to repair this I've set up some sponge and k1 filters.  So what's the next step and how can I make the canister silent again? And if I use an external pump, what size did I need to drive the canister?   "

1059,Spayed cat recovery question,I got my cat spayed now three days ago. She has been wearing a buster after surgery outfit !instead of a collar. Today on the morning I noticed that she was not wearing the outfit anymore. I was very shocked as the outfit is pretty tight that how did she manage to take it off and it wasn't even open. Now I am worried that she has been licking her wound. I checked it but couldn't tell if it's swollen or infected.  Also she haven't pooped for now 3 days and she still have ate. When should I get worried?  Thanks a lot. 
1060,My dog won’t eat unless it is in my hand,My dog is 11 months old and I just recently got him a few days ago from the shelter the first couple days he was eating out of his bowl and then today he just wouldn’t eat so I tried showing him his food my putting my hand in it and getting a hand full and he started eating it so I stopped and walked away and he would just follow me so I tried it again and he ate it out of my hand I don’t know if he thinks it’s a game we’re playing or what but now he won’t eat at all I tried feeding him again later toda and when I set the bowl down he pawed at my hand and started licking it we have been feeding him people food out of our hand so maybe that could be it but I’m not exactly sure anyone got a solution?? 
1061,Juwel Filter Pump Too High?,"We have a Juwel Lido 200.  The black filter box was on the right side of the aquarium; but we wanted to move it so we removed the silicone and re-siliconed it on the left-side of the aquarium instead.  However, when we moved it we weren't careful enough about the height at which we put it; and it's a little higher than before - perhaps 1cm or so.  The heater is still submerged (and over the min water line on the heater); but the pump is only partially submerged now. The impeller and output are submerged; but not all of the rest of the pump.  If you look at the pictures on the Juwel website ([website]I know ideally these should be fully submerged; but all i can find on this online in general is that it ""may reduce the life of the pump"" because the water also helps cool the pump.  Are we likely to have a problem here - should we remove the silicone, drain our tank again and move the box down? Or will it be OK, just louder/hotter/less efficient? "
1062,Microscopic like bugs or parasites in my tank?,"2 months ago a friend gave me a plant (encharlis or some thing) from her plastic guppy pond.. it had algae and bugs etc... but I just rinsed it in warm water a couple times, hoping that would be enough. The plant has since died along with fish... but I have noticed tiny tiny little bigger than needle point size bugs?     Are these parasites? How can I get rid of these? Will they affect fish if I put more plants in later?  "
1063,Curious cat in an apartment,"I live in an apartment in a large city, so I can't let my cat out because he would get lost or run in front of a car. It is a young and very curious cat, so he naturally wants to get out and explore.   He spends a lot of time just sitting in front of a window, staring out, sometimes crying loudly because he can't get out. I bought him a guide, but he doesn't like wearing it (a lot).   What could I do? Is there any way to satisfy the cat's curiosity without letting him out?  "
1064,Is this normal behaviour for a cat?,"My cat has been acting very strange today and wonder if this is normal behavior or if something is wrong.  I have 2 cats, one is male and one is female. The male one has been neutered. So the female shouldn't be pregnant. The female has not yet been spayed. They are both roughly 8 months old.  Since this morning the female cat has been acting very strange. I noticed she was lowering the front half of her body to the ground and sticking her bum into the air while tapping her back feet back and forward. At first, I assumed she was maybe going through heat or something and was trying to get the male cat to have sex with her (which he showed no interest to, obviously), but now I am starting to get a little worried. She has been doing this all day, as much as possible, while making whimpering sounds and having small tremors. It seems like she is in some discomfort. She has been very active today and even when relaxing she is still holding her bum in the air. She has also been craving a lot of attention from me, cuddling into me as much as possible, which is not like her. Normally she likes to be on her own.  Is this normal? Was I correct and she is just going through heat? Her strange behavior is really worrying me.  Thanks! "
1065,Feeding snakes skinned rabbits,I farm rabbits for pelts and meat. I’ve been wanting to get a snake but I would like to keep the pelts for my pillows and blankets. Would giving a python a skinned animal be okay or do they need that skin and hair? Is there nutrition properties they need in that? 
1066,Sand to Clay Ratio for Horse Footing,"This is the best place I could think to ask this question. I figured there would be plenty of horse people on here and this question is tangentially related to horses.  I have an area of my pasture that has basically been destroyed. The horses eat in this area in the winter and drink from nearby all year round. The ground has eroded quite a bit from them making holes in the mud and carrying it off on their feet over the year. It doesn't help that they kill the grass and the rain run off erodes it to. There is nothing to do about that. I'm not interested in feeding them in different areas as this would be a ton of extra work and the 4-wheeler and even the horses would eventually mess these areas up as well. Better to have one sacrificial area.  What I'm looking for is the depth I need to mix in sand to make the clay harder. I'm basing this off of building a footing for an arena. I don't want to use anything like gravel or concrete wash, because they'd cause more problems in the long run than they'd solve now. I was watching a tv show on how they improved the Kentucky Horse Park for the FEI games and one arena builder built the bases for these arenas by mixing 50/50 sand and clay. He said you can pack it, but not as well as mother nature can in 6 months.   My hope is that if I get sand and mix it with the clay where the horses eat, they won't be standing in deep mud. This reduces the risk of illness through things like scratches, it makes the horses more comfortable, and reduces my irritation in blanketing in the mud.  Here is my math. 300' of fence line, 10' wide strip, 3"" deep. This ends up being 750cubic/ft. There are 27cubic/ft. in a cubic yard. So 750/27= ~28cubic/yards. I figure that if you mix 3"" of sand with the top 3"" of clay, evenly, you'll end up with a 6"" bed, which I think would be fine. Google says a standard dump truck contains 10-14 cubic/yards of sand. So (2) dump truck loads would do the area.   Do you guys think this would be deep enough to firm up the footing in a 300'x10' strip for the horses to stand on when eating. I don't need it to be like asphalt, I just want it hard enough that they aren't sinking and leaving huge holes. Could I go shallower and only do 1.5"" of sand, so I'd have 3"" of hardened base? Do I even need to mix it, or will it mix well enough as the horses walk on it and stomp it into the mud below?   Thanks for the help guys. If you have a question about something I've left out, feel free to ask and I'll update with the answer. "
1067,Should I feed my cat whenever she asks?,"My cat has always been good about weight. She's always been fit, incredibly active, and agile. People often guess she's like 2 but she's actually almost 9 years old. She was indoor for the first year of her life, then transitioned to indoor/out for about 3 years, and has been strictly indoor for the past 4 years.   She just went to the vet a month ago and got weighed at 8.08 which is fine because she's a very small framed cat (like 75% the size of a normal cat I'd say).   But in the last 2 months I've noticed she asks for food a lot more. It's been the same food for almost 2 years so I don't think it's that. She doesn't have worms and the vet said she's very healthy, especially for her age (8 years, 9 in May).   Has anyone else experienced this? Is my cat secretly playing hard while I""m not home and chilling and eating while I am here?  "
1068,Kitty goes from cuddly to murderous without warning,"I have a Maine Coon which was a rescue.  She was wild for about five months before the shelter picked her up.  I got her at about 5 1/2 months, just over 3 years ago.  I figured she'd remain near-feral, but she has become extremely affectionate, esp over the last year.  She meets me at the door, jumps up in my lap, licks my face, never wants to be in a different room than I am, and is generally a sweetheart.  The only thing is that she will suddenly go into attack mode.    Now, I don't do anything to provoke this.  She will jump up on my lap, or on my chest when I'm laying down, meow at me, and demand to be petted.    Then, in the middle of being petted, she'll attack my hand and arm SAVAGELY.  Now, I know that this isn't malicious on her part, because if I put my face near her, she goes back to cuddle mode.  The problem is, she's a BIG KITTY and can actually break the skin with her teeth, and I'm sure her claws could cut steel if we let them get sharp enough. (we have the vet trim them).  Anyone know why she might be doing this? Is there anything I can do to discourage this behavior? "
1069,Anxious dog howls and screams when we take our other dog out,"So we have three dogs ages 5, 3, and 7 months. We take the two older dogs outside to go potty at the same time and take the puppy separately because she gets distracted to easily. Whenever we take the puppy out our 3 year old starts jumping on the gate and screaming as loud as he can and absolutely freaking out. We tried switching it up and taking him out with the puppy and taking the 5 year old out alone and he did the same thing. Is this some form of separation anxiety? Is there anything we can do to stop it? I’m at a loss as to what to do at this point.  "
1070,Allowing puppy on couch,"So to start off I have seen this question:  Guarding couch  which deals with a problem that occurred in the one incident but it seemed more related to guarding than anything.  Introduction  So I am about to have a new puppy around the house and will probably be posting / seeking much help from this community in the process. She was just born so will have her after some weeks before the transfer so my wife and I are trying to be as informed as we can before hand.  We have both owned dogs before, and dog sat many times, but we have one disagreement so I wanted to get some thoughts from people who have more experience and actual evidence.  Question  Is it bad to let a new puppy up on furniture such as our couch?  We will have a separate crate / bed left open for her always so she has her own space so does allowing her as a puppy up on the couch initially create the thought that it is her space as well and she can come up whenever she wants? I have seen where people say to let the dogs up only when they are invited and then they should obey when you tell them to get off but isn't it easier and more repeatable to simply not let them up in the first place? For me I find it confusing for the dogs that sometimes they are allowed but other times they are not so seems harder to enforce the not allowed part. "
1071,Hiding rescue cat will get comfortable one day?,"I've scoured the internet and found lots of similar questions, so I know the answer is just to give it time. But if anyone has any suggestions and reassurances I'd love to hear them.   I adopted a rescue cat just under a week ago. She's just over a year old and was being fostered in a home with several other cats. The woman who fostered her said she had become significantly less timid in the few months she'd been there, eventually seeking out pets and affection, and thought she might one day be a lap cat (obviously no guarantees).   I made the mistake of not confining her to one room when I first brought her home (though I have a small apartment and not a lot of rooms with doors that aren't my bedroom), and she's since been hiding most of the time. She occasionally creeps into whatever room I'm in to hide there, but only in the evenings. I've tried to give her space, although I think I pushed too hard one day and set us back a bit. She tends to squirm backwards, further under the bed/couch, if I approach her slowly with a treat in my hand. She's eating well and using the litter box without any issues. She does tend to explore more at night when I'm asleep, because she wakes me up meowing (is she anxious?).  I guess the issue is that I'm impatient and worried that she'll never warm up to me. It's only been a week, but she's a darling and I'm eager to pet her. Is there anything I can do to make her more comfortable, or anything I shouldn't do? I assume it's too late to confine her to one room. Has anyone had experience with a rescue cat that took a long while to get comfortable? How long did you wait? Any assurances would be greatly appreciated. She's my first solo pet and I'm anxious about doing the right thing. Thanks. "
1072,My dog won't get tired,"I have a mix of Border Collie with Australian Shepherd. Recently we moved to a country house and now he has a 24/7 access to big green fields and almost 24/7 human attention. Happy dog. But I'm worried about him going over his limits for his love of playing. Looks like even when tired he just continues to find stuff to do, run, catch, bark. Is that ok? Or should I put some limits? My other dogs are not that crazy and I never had that worry with them, even though they had the same benefits. "
1073,New cat's third eyelid showing when asleep,"I have a new rescue cat who is slowly settling in - she's very timid, but getting braver every day. This question is about her eyes.   When she is falling asleep/already asleep and her eyes are half-closed, her pupils kind of roll back into her head. I know this is because of the third eyelid cats have, but I keep seeing online that it could be a sign of serious illness. I've only ever seen it when she's falling asleep, and when she is deeply asleep her eyes are closed all the way and I don't see anything. I've never seen it happen when she is awake.  I'm mostly worried because I saw that it could be a symptom of dehydration, and I immediately started wondering if she was getting enough water. I've never seen her drink, and I haven't been monitoring the water level in her bowl closely enough, I guess. She eats a small can of wet food in addition to dry food every day, and there's urine in her litter box every day. I can't really speak to lethargy or not, because she mostly spends her time hiding or sleeping.  I'd take her to the vet, but since she's been here less than a week I can't really get close to her yet, so the effort of catching her and putting her in the carrier would be fairly traumatizing. I will probably call the vet in the morning regardless, to be on the safe side.  Has anyone seen this before? Do I just have a cat with weird sleep habits, or is it something worse?  "
1074,Is it possible to feed a cat a healthy meat diet?,"I was given 3 kittens by a friend who's cat had a litter.   Not wanting to separate them, I took all 3.  They were great kittens, they played, they loved the house and they seemed healthy.  2 boys and 1 girl.  Now, fully grown, the top cat is a big healthy beast of a cat.  More than one person has told me that he's the ""biggest cat I've ever seen"".  About 17 lbs but not fat.   He rules the house.  He's not mean, he just sits there and watches everyone.   His name, appropriately is Panther but sometimes I just call him boss.  The little one, the only girl, grew up picked on by her brothers.   She's soft and cuddly and cute as can be.  Despite being basically a twin, she's 11 lbs of fluff, but on occasion when she gets spooked, she'll grab you and you get a sense that there's some real muscle behind her fluff.   Growing up she was the smallest and I think she got used to being the smallest.   Her name is Peaches.  The middle one is the one I'm asking about.   He and his brother as kittens were equals, but as they grew to full size, Panther added more weight to a more solid frame and Pepper, the middle cat, stayed skinny and he weighs about 14 lbs, and is visibly skinny.    All 3 are currently about 2 years 8 months old.  I used to give them treats.  Turkey was a favorite but when Pepper started to only want to eat Turkey and nothing else, I stopped giving them that.  All 3 cats went cold turkey as they say, because I know it's not healthy for a cat to only eat meat.  The problem is, Pepper doesn't seem to like cat food.  He eats it sparingly and he's growing skinnier.  He's stopped washing himself as well as his brother and sister and his fur is growing a little bit oily and clumpy.    I know that there could be several causes for this, but I'm also wondering if perhaps he just doesn't like cat food and if I can try making him turkey or chicken based meals.  I know that some places sell ""raw"" cat food but I've tried that in the past and my cats didn't like it.  It's also quite expensive, no cheaper than Turkey.  So, here's my question.  Is experimenting with feeding him turkey again a bad idea?, with proper supplements (there's a specific protein I think that cats need to be fed that they get from cat food but not from meat), but I don't remember what it is.   Is that worth trying or would I just need to make him go cold turkey again if I did that.  And can canned and dry cat food be bad for some cats?  EDIT - Update a couple months later.  My cat who went on the self imposed ""I just want to eat sliced turkey"" diet has adapted to eating cat food and he's back to being about the same weight as his slightly bigger brother.   No longer skinny.   He still begs sometimes when I open the fridge, but he's eating cat food again.    I have a soft heart and I want to feed him cold cuts, but I don't.   I haven't bought turkey slices in nearly 3 months and he seems to have forgotten that they exist.  Other meats don't have the same pull on him, so he's good now.    So, long story short, the cold turkey with sliced turkey experiment worked.  The trick now for me, as they're approaching 3 years old, is that all 3 are slowly putting on weight.   I have to ease them into eating less now, but that's another question. "
1075,Why are my ammonia levels still high?,"I performed a water change two days ago. My ammonia levels were at 0.25-0.5 ppm right after the water change, which one user suggested was due to the chloramine removers.  However, it has been two days and I saw one of my fish lying at the bottom of the tank, resting... during daylight. Its back fin is also tense, as in, it's not as big as it should be because he's contracting it out of stress. I tested for ammonia and it's at 0.5 ppm. My nitrates have increased to 10 ppm.  I'm going to perform another 25% water change.   I added a carbon filter two days ago inside my AquaClear filter consisting of a one-month old bio-filter and a mechanical filter. WHY IS THIS NOT WORKING?  EDIT Just performed another water change, it definitely has to do with the de-chloramines. Maybe they aren't settled? What is the chemical reaction behind it? "
1076,Can I adopt a Presidentially-pardoned Thanksgiving turkey?,"Today (November 28, 2013) is Thanksgiving Day in America, and for Thanksgiving, we eat a lot of turkeys.  It is currently tradition for the U.S. President to give a ""Presidential Pardon"" to a turkey.  The turkey's life is saved and it lives through the day.  What happens to the pardoned turkey after Thanksgiving?    Does it go on to live a life of leisure as a cherished pet?   Can I adopt one of these pardoned turkeys? "
1077,Why is one of my cats licking walls and windows?,"I've been catching my cat licking windows and recently some walls. The doubtful advantage is that the lower half of my windows don't fog any more, but why is she doing that? Is it unhealthy for the little creature? Should I discourage her doing so and if yes, how? "
1078,Does calming food really help my pets?,"The pet shop sells special food called ""Calm"" for both cats and dogs, apparently for the holiday or fireworks season. Is this food really a solution, or is it feel-good for the pet owners?    I once read an article that animals get afraid of the loud noise outside, and as a result of eating the 'keep calm'-food, they don't have the energy to hide and get even more afraid, sometimes even panic. Is this true? "
1079,Is there anything I should know or consider before giving a pet as a gift?,"I want to give someone a pet as a gift.  I was thinking of making it a Christmas gift, but it could be a birthday gift if I don't find the right pet soon.  So I was discussing the options with some coworkers asking things like, ""Should I give a pet as a gift? And if so, what kind of pet would be best?"" or ""Would a dog, a cat, or maybe something else be best?""  But decided I needed to give this whole thing some more thought.  So, Is there anything I should know or consider before giving a pet as a gift? "
1080,What research is there on the long term effects of pinch-induced behavioral inhibition conditioning on cats?,"There have been studies using ""clipnosis"" a.k.a. pinch-induced behavioral inhibition (PIBI) as a technique to immobilize a variety of animals. The following study examines the use of such a technique on cats:      Research has documented immobilization of rodents, rabbits, guinea pigs and dogs by mechanical means, typically using neck clips or inversion ('animal hypnosis').  [...]    Domestic cats may be effectively immobilized by clips placed along the animal's dorsum. We use the term 'pinch-induced behavioral inhibition' (PIBI) for this behavior because it describes both the method and the response, while avoiding the more anthropomorphic term 'hypnosis'.    Such a technique renders many cats incapable of moving, as the loose skin is pinched and it appears that movement would prove to be painful.   Many pets are carried by the scruff of the neck by their mothers as babies, but this is usually considered unwise practice because as animals mature (as discussed Is it ok to pick my adult cat up by the scruff of the neck?), the skin is not designed to carry the weight of a animal. In the wild, a grown animal being carried by the scruff of the neck would usually be the next meal of the animal within whose mouth it was being carried.   The immobilization and subsequent inactivity of the animal is perceived to have a hypnotic or calming effect. I argue that this perceived calming effect is due to the animal's inability to move, and the pain involved in attempting to move.  I also see this technique as being threatening to the animal, as it is not a natural position for an adult pet.  This post advocates the use of PIBI, but be warned the images here can be upsetting to some people.  What research is there about whether it is painful for the cat and the psychological effects with regard  to PIBI? "
1081,Can I put any other fish in with a male betta?,"I had a male betta fish for a long time, and was told by the people at the pet store that I could put in a pleco fish (aka an algae eater) because it would stay near the bottom. Since, he claimed, the betta would spend all his time near the top, the betta wouldn't notice the pleco and they would get along fine.  This worked out for a while, but one day I came home and they had attacked each other and both had died. This leaves me wondering - was it really okay to put the pleco in there? Should I have left the betta by himself? Was there a better type of fish to add to that tank?  "
1082,How can I keep my cat from climbing on my desk?,"My cat loves to climb on my desk at home. Problem is, he is constantly knocking things off (he broke a cup and a couple other things this week), and messing up stuff on my desk, bumping my monitors, etc.  I have tried spraying him with water to get off my desk, I have tried scolding him, I have tried putting unpleasant things on my desk, and also bodily removing him every time he gets on it while I am home and can see him. I can't take everything off my desk, either, unlike, say, a table. He's three years old now, and I am getting super frustrated by this behaviour. It only started since he has been the only cat in the house (for about a year now).   Nothing seems to stop him.   I know I keep his treats in one of my desk drawers - could this be part of the problem?  How can I keep my desk cat-free, while still keeping my stuff on it?  "
1083,Where did my danio fish mysteriously disappear to?,"I have 8 white skirt tetras, 8 albino cory cats, and had 8 danios. Now I have 7 danios. One mysteriously disappeared. I am very doubtful it is hiding because my danios don't do that; all they do is swim at the surface.   It is impossible for the fish to have eaten the danio. They are too small.  It is impossible for the fish to have jumped out. The tank is fully covered. I checked around the tank, searching for a good 30 minutes - nothing found.  My fish isn't dead. The cory cats would have easily started feasting on it. They eat anything that's at the bottom, essentially. (Perhaps it died while I wasn't around?)  My filter doesn't contain the fish.  No sign of a fish skeleton ANYWHERE.  What could have happened to it? "
1084,Giving a dog in a high rise enough potty breaks,"I have been considering getting a dog in my apartment. Being in a high-rise, it will be time-consuming to let the dog outside, so it needs to be planned out (I.e. a doggie door won't work).  How often should a dog be let out each day to avoid discomfort from a full bladder? Are there any studies, and does it depend on the breed? "
1085,Are there any special considerations for adopting a cross-eyed cat?,A short discussion in chat made me wonder: do cats that are cross-eyed require any special care?   Source: dailymail.co.uk   Does it affect the cat's balance (or negatively in any other way)? Can (or should) it be corrected?  
1086,How should I transport dogs across the country?,"According to English Wikipedia:     In June 1983, the Romney family left their Belmont, Massachusetts home on their way to Romney's parents' cottage in Beach O'Pines, Ontario for an annual vacation along the shore of Lake Huron. Seamus rode in a carrier on the roof of the family's Chevrolet Caprice station wagon for the 12 hour trip. Romney had built a windshield for the carrier to make the ride more comfortable for the dog. During the 650-mile (1,050 km) trip, Seamus had a bout of diarrhea.   Aside from the diarrhea, was this a proper method for transporting a dog? What methods should owners use to transport dogs when travelling cross-country? "
1087,How to train my dog to wear a collar and not chew through it?,"My 9 month old chihuahua-yorkie mix refuses to wear a collar with her identification on it.  She is a very small dog, weighing 4.6 pounds, and the vet says she is full-grown.    We have tried extra-small dog collars with the collar as tight as possible, but loose enough so we can still fit two fingers beneath it.  Somehow, she is consistently able to get the collar wedged into her mouth and she either chews through the collar or it will get stuck in her mouth, keeping it open.  Example of her latest chewed-through collar:    As you can guess, this is very concerning. We are worried that she will choke when it gets stuck, but we don't like leaving her without any type of identification.   How can I train my dog to be comfortable with the collar on so she doesn't try to chew it off?  "
1088,Why do cats hate riding in cars?,"Whenever we need to take one our cats in the car (usually to the vets, but not always), the in-car drama is quite intense with a yowling and even vomiting (rare for short durations). Why do cats, unlike dogs, hate riding in cars? Is there a way to make this a better experience for them?  "
1089,Can I feed a dog cooked meat or fish that is a week old?,Sometimes I have cooked meat or fish in my refrigerator that is a week old.  Is this food safe to feed to a dog without reheating?  Is it safe to feed to a dog after reheating? 
1090,"As a complete novice, what costs should I plan for when adopting a shelter cat?","I have never adopted an animal. What costs are there? What about:   The adoption costs Food costs Litter bix/bedding Vet Pet sitting for trips   Etc. What categories did I miss? How often do expenses arise in each category, and what is a rough range of the costs in these categories?  I really know nothing, and would like to be prepared. "
1091,How to handle a disappearing hermit crab?,"What should you do if you lose a hermit crab? I have a friend whose family put very large shells in for the crab to try, and it disappeared. That was a long time ago, so it's obviously dead, but what should you do if you haven't seen it for a few days? Is shaking the shells inappropriate? "
1092,How to wash cat hair out of fleece fabric?,"First post here; a friend just sent me a box of sewing supplies, including quite a few yards of fleece and felt fabrics. Problem is she lives with cats and I'm mid-level allergic (not have-to-go-to-the-ER bad, but bad enough that I'd like to minimize contact).  Two of us in my house are similarly allergic, so it's massively important to me that however I clean this leaves no residue in our washer/dryer.   It's safe to assume that these fabrics have been sitting in her house for a period of months to years, likely with extended contact in some cases. I'm loathe to just throw the whole box away (it was a surprise gift, and very thoughtful) but health has to come first.  What's the best way to wash the fleece/felt to get the cat hair off, without compromising our laundry machines? In a serious pinch I could lug everything to the nearest laundromat, is that going to be the best way to go? Can I get away with just buying a lint roller instead? Alternatively, is the fabric just too compromised and I'm better off throwing it all away?  I don't own pets so my cat knowledge is limited. "
1093,How long does pasture need to be rested to prevent worm re-infestation?,I'm moving my horses into new paddocks where there hasn't been horses for 4 weeks. I'm wondering if there can still be worms in these paddocks.  Is it possible to rest paddocks for long enough to prevent worm re-infestation? If so how long does pasture need to be rested to prevent worm re-infestation? 
1094,Did I remove the tick the right way?,"My dog she's 2.5 years old, golden shephard mix. I found a tick that looks like this   (but darker). It was below the neck on her back.  This is the first time ever. And I heard horror stories of how it can spread to thousands and even end up blocking the ear (blame google image search).  I tried to pull it with a wipe, to no avail, until it popped. I feared the head or whatever is still stuck under the skin so I went to the clinic.  They said not to worry, but I didn't feel it was sincere.  She always gets a once / 2 months anti bug prevention thing that they spread on her back. So they gave her that a month early, cleaned around the mess I made by popping the tick, and that's it.  Anything else I should know? Is there a risk of eggs being somewhere ready to hatch and reproduce? "
1095,What could be the cause of my dogs hair pattern?,"I've recently started to notice that my dog (staff, female) is getting quite patchy hair on the top of her head. She also has a bald patch on her neck that I am unable to get a picture if at this moment in time. Should I be concerned? I know that fleas are not the case as she has none  Could it be molting? Sorry if a silly question just making sure, thanks and kind regards.    "
1096,My cat has a sort of.. pattern by her tail,"I have a cat called Tink. She is 6 years old, and she has a sort of.. pattern, if you'd like to call it by that, on her part by her tail. I thought it was a bald patch at first, but I looked up images of the bald patches and it doesn't look like one.   I have a picture, sorry for the bad quality.    Does ANYBODY know what it is? How did it come up? "
1097,Am I 'stealing' someones cat?,"We are currently renovating a new house. We are there every night and we are visited by a very friendly cat every night.  From day 1 he was very friendly, approached us and meowed until we pet him. We have never fed him and we have never let him go inside, although he went inside the hallway by himself one time he now stays outside all the time.  He visits us every night, stays in the garden for 4 hours while occasionally getting cuddled and leaves around the time we leave.   The neighbour informed us of his name, and that he lives a couple of houses away. His owners aren't home a lot, so I guess he likes the attention. We enjoy his company very much. However, I'm afraid he will start to see us as his new (maybe second?) home.   We do not mind at all, but are we 'stealing' him from his owners by petting him?  I'd also like to clarify he is not malnourished at all and looks very clean and well groomed. "
1098,Why can't I pat my dog for any mistakes if dog's pain tolerance is 4 times higher than human?,"When training a dog, the worst punishment I should do is that I should leave and close the door behind if I see something I don't like.  My question is that why can't I pat my dog for any mistakes at the spot if dog's pain tolerance is 4 times higher than human?  Also does leave always tell my dog it's a ""no""? For example, if my dog is eating its own poop, if I leave, doesn't tell him it's okay to continue eating? "
1099,How to use CO2 tablets for Aquarium?,"I'm new to live planted aquarium. Recently while looking for CO2 system for my 22 Liters (i.e. ~6 Gallon) tank, i came through a product named CO2 tablets from generic seller. But don't know the procedure to use this specific product. If someone has used this kind of stuff before please give me your suggestions to use it or not. If yes then how to?? And I don't want my plants to get killed by avoidable mistakes.  Product link: [website]"
1100,Wet food vs. Dry food,"I've been feeding my dog Natural Balance dry food for the past few years. Only occasionally will she eat it right away when I put it out for her, but most of the time she ""eventually"" gets to it. The vet told me as long as she is eating at some point, it's ok. Some dogs are not that motivated by food and she is in healthy shape.   The other day I was running out of dry food so I bought a can of Newman's Own chicken and rice food. I was actually quite surprised out how ""human-like"" it looked. When I gave it to her, she absolutely devoured it in like 30 seconds.  I feel slightly guilty for feeding her dry food that she's not that excited by. Should I change to wet food b/c she seems to enjoy it more? Maybe mix 50/50 dry/wet? "
1101,Most likely cause of hair loss in dogs,"I have what I think might be a very good controlled experiment since I have two dogs.  They are both Great Pyrenees.  One is ""mine"" a female 7 years old and has a thick impermeable healthy white coat.  [EDIT: photos provided here now] []1 []2  The other is a rescue dog, about the same age.  He has lived with the female for about 3-4 years.  He's steadily lost hair and his flesh is a combination of pink and black skin underneath.  He still has full hair around his face and chest/shoulders. But it's VERY thin back of that, and almost gone on his belly.  He also has ""tags"" of flesh on his stomach area.  And, he's skinny, and doesn't smell good even when he's bathed.  He's got access to as much food as he wants (dry) but has stayed skinny.  Obviously, it's not contagious as Wendy hasn't gotten this at all.  I am sorry I haven't put a lot of effort into him but have some money to at least try something.  Is it possible this is worms?  If so what type, and what type of medicine should I try?  Honestly, I don't have the budget for the 150-300 that a vet would charge, but am willing to spend 30-40 on an OTC or internet-order treatment.  Thanks.  Oh, one more thing, he's not extremely active, but no obvious sign of lethargy.  Pretty quiet though. "
1102,Can my fish coexist?,"I have 2 turquoise rainbows, 2 albino corys, 4 zebra danios, 5 serpae tetras and 5 cherry barbs in my 30 gallon tank.  Do you think I'm overstocked? If so, what do you think is the best mix/number for a tank of my size? "
1103,Is it safe to use ant traps if they're out of reach of my cats?,"We have ants in our house, and nothing I've tried so far has been sufficiently successful. Now I'm considering using ant traps, but only under the kitchen cabinets behind the plinth, a place where neither my cats nor my kids (a baby and a toddler) would ever be able to reach them (no chance of them getting in there). Would that be safe? Are there other aspects we'd need to consider? "
1104,"Aquaponics: lobsters, clams, oysters and tilapia all in the same tank?","I've really been getting into gardening over the past year and have just started looking at aquaponics. I hope to one day build my own homestead, and want a big greenhouse with a central aquaponics ""pond"" for raising fish and shellfish.  After looking at lots of setups online, I see it's possible to grow lobsters, clams, oysters, tilapia and many many other critters using aquaponics. But I haven't stumbled across any that combine different species in the same water.     Question: Is it possible to have all four of those in the same tank? Or would they need to be separated? Any special considerations here?   I'm probably going to build a practice setup in my current house, just to get used to everything. So if they are compatible, in which order should they be introduced to each other? Maybe the tilapia first? "
1105,Will a male cockatiel take care of 5 day old babies on its own?,Our female cockatiel died today. They have 2 babies which are around a week old. Will the male feed and take care of the babies by itself? What should we do? 
1106,What is a good way to spend quality time with my housemate's dog while looking after it?,"Hope you'll forgive the beginner nature of this question.  I am not a dog person, so I have very little knowledge or experience with dogs, and most of the information on the web seems (quite reasonably) to be tailored to owners and/or enthusiasts.  I will be looking after my housemate's dog for several weeks, and I know he is concerned that the dog will get lonely.  Apart from taking him on walks, are there any things I can do to help him feel cared for and attended to?  Are there signs I should look out for that he's not getting enough attention?  Generally while I'm around the house I'll be reading, watching TV or working on the laptop; will doing these things in the same room as him be enough to make him feel like he has company, or do I need to be engaging him more actively? "
1107,What should I do if my chihuahua licked some chocolate?,"My chihuahua licked some chocolate from a 41g dark chocolate bar. She licked/ate a really small amount and though I can't tell how many grams it was, it seems that it should have been less than 5 grams?  She's really small, weighs less than 2 kilos and it was about an hour ago.  Should I worried or take her to vet? "
1108,Is it normal to feel the bones in a cats back legs?,"I noticed just now that when I feel my cats back legs there's not a lot of flesh and I can easily distinguish both bones and the gap between them. Is this normal or something I should be concerned about? If it's not normal what might be causing it?  She eats well and has plenty of meat on the rest of her body, including the front legs. "
1109,"My cat hasn't pooped in 2 days, what should I do?","My cat hasn't pooped in 2 days. How long do cats typically go between pooping? How long should I wait before I take him to the vet?  He is a neutered male domestic short hair, about three years old and otherwise in good health. "
1110,Can an American Bulldog tolerate Wisconsin temperatures?,"My American Bulldog spends the night indoors (not heated) but then is outside for 12 hours every day.  Will my dog be okay during winter? If not, what precautions should I take? "
1111,How should I time feeding and watering while running amateur canicross?,"I live with my 3-yo mix of labrador and golden in big city and started jogging together. For now we run 5km or maximum 10km routes about two times per week. If it matters temperatures now in my city will be about 0 C (32 F)  I would like to know what are best strategies for feeding and watering dog?  1) Is amount of fodder given on package for active dog just enough?  2) How many hours before or after such run the dog should get its food? (For now she is eating twice a day at 7 a.m and 7 p.m) I try to give it at least 2 hours break after feeding before run, and if feeding after at least 40 minutes after run.  3) What about watering while running? Should I take some water for 10km run to provide it in halfway? "
1112,What reasons could there be for my rabbit not defecating?,"My 6 year old female outdoor rabbit is free to roam for up to 8 hours a day in our large garden, but has stopped eating the grass and hay. At one point she stopped eating altogether, and the vet said her teeth were in bad condition and recommended we have her put down. That was about 6 months ago.  We initially put her on a course of antibiotics, and put some water on her pellets to soften just to get her to eat, which helped as she now munches them dry again. We also noticed that she started eating the crusts of the wholemeal bread we fling out for the birds. Thinking she was hungry, we gave her small amounts.  I have noticed over the last few days now, there are less and less droppings around so I'm really worried. The vet is only going to suggest we put her down, so is there anything else we can do?  I'm not sure if her teeth hurt when she chews hay, grass, or the odd bit of lettuce or pear, but we don't want to stop giving her food. Apart from this she seems really happy so we don't want to get her put to sleep. What reason could there be for her to stop defecating? "
1113,What could be causing my Basset Hound to stop sleeping through the entire night?,"Our dog has been completely fine and content on a night, when he's just had the one walk and sleeps through the night almost always.   However as of late, he has been getting up and wandering around at 3am in the morning until we let him outside, and then again at 6am - after a few days this gets incredibly tiring! We have hardwood flooring so the tapping of his feet is enough to keep us awake..  The only real change we have made in the last few weeks is a change of food: from Kirkland Chicken to a Kirkland Duck with beans. Could changing his food cause  behavior like this? or could it just be a coincidence, the only other change that is apparent is the weather had turned to snow and -10 most nights, so the heating has been coming on intermittently through the night.  He usually sleeps on the foot of the bed, and he is a 2 year old purebred Basset.  What could be causing this restlessness and what can be done to stop it? "
1114,What is the procedure for adopting a purebred dog in the United States?,"I mean, I've had dogs before, it's not like I'm trying to get a dog for the first time in my life. The thing is, I am an immigrant, I had to leave my previous dog back home; A caucasian shepherd - a pretty serious breed (here's a google for image search if you don't know what I'm talking about).  For the past few years, for various reasons, I couldn't have any dogs and frankly my life felt somewhat insufficient. Finally I think I'm ready to get one. Considering all possible choices I decided to get a zwergschnauzer, and that would be my first ever dog since moving to USA.  I want to get a purebred male, either a young adult or a puppy. However it seems to be quite a difficult task to find a good puppy in my area (San Francisco Bay Area).   First of all the price. According to ads I found on the Internet, it varies from [tex]3000 for a puppy. I mean I understand you get what you pay for, but really $3000 for a puppy? And we're talking about one of the most popular breeds in US, not some exotic one.  I am not trying to get a show dog, but a family pet, yet I want to get a good and healthy puppy and if it really makes huge difference, maybe I should prepare myself to pay reasonably higher than average price? But I won't pay $3000. It would probably be cheaper to fly to Germany and bring one here.  Also it seems finding a puppy is difficult. I've been emailing in response to all ads I've found on Craigslist, eBay Classifieds, and PetFinder. Most of the puppies are either already sold out or of a mixed breed.   I found web page of Miniature Schnauzer Club of Northern California and wrote them an email asking for recommendations - no answer yet.   Can you tell me the process of adopting a purebred dog in the United States? I'm especially interested in knowing the parts like how the registration process works, and the normal procedure for bargaining for price. "
1115,How can I prevent my dog's nails from wearing down while providing her enough exercise?,"I have an incredibly active 8 year old Nova Scotia Duck Tolling Retriever. It's always a challenge to tire her out (she's more active than any 8 puppies I've ever met put together)  Last night while we were playing fetch she wore her nails down to the quick and started bleeding. She didn't seem bothered by the blood and didn't even notice until we were in the dog store buying supplies to fix her up.   Some of her nails are peeling on the outside and though only one bled last night, the tip of the quick is very visible on most of them.   Is there anything I can do to strengthen her nails or make them grow back faster? She eats a fish based dog food, so she has plenty of Omega-3 fatty acids in her diet. Her coat is always shiny and super soft, so I don't think she's lacking in that department. I want to continue to exercise her a lot, but I also don't want her messing up her feet all the time. Suggestions? "
1116,Is there any evidence to suggest that lizards can recognize a human face?,"I was playing air drums next to my 2-year old Uromastyx's tank, and I noticed out of the corner of my eye that she kept glancing up and my face, despite my hands going crazy 2 feet down (almost giving me a ""what are you doing?"" look, but that might be giving her too much credit).  I thought that was interesting, so I stood up, but extended my arms to keep my hands at the same place (increasing the distance between my hands and face), and she actually readjusted, and kept looking at my head.  This struck me as odd because she's very skidish, and tends to run from anything moving. This would seem to suggest that she's giving special attention to the face, but as far as I know, they don't have the mental machinery to make such a recognition (Fusiform Face Area?)  Does anyone know anything on this topic, or has anyone noticed that their reptiles seem to be able to recognize faces (not distinguish between people, because that could involve a ton of different things, and I'm almost certain that they are capable of that already). "
1117,What are safe materials for repairing a scratching post?,"We have a small carpeted cat tree with a sisal/hemp covered scratching post support. The cats seem to love this scratching post more than any other, as they have torn up the sisal to where it is falling off the post in several places. I would like to repair this by replacing the sisal cord in its entirety. The post was commercially made and cost around $40 new.  I found this video that does make it look very possible to do this repair myself. The video (and several other sources) suggest using either white (Elmer's) glue or hot glue as a means of securing the sisal to the post. This would certainly be low cost, but I'm concerned about the toxicity. So far as I've noticed, none of the other scratching posts we've bought have used an adhesive of any kind. Instead, it seems they've used an out-of-sight metal fastener (staple, nail etc.).  One of our cats has a habit of eating everything he can get his teeth around. Is glue a safe material for repairing the cat tree, or would be risk of poisoning? Or should I just do the repairs the hard way and get a staple gun or break out the hammer and nails?  Update: I was all set to repair the post with solid materials only (new sisal and metal staples). I started disassembling the torn and shredded sisal and it became clear that the original manufacturer had used at least 2 types of glue. One is a hot-glue look alike used near the ends, which were also secured with numerous staples. The other was more of a contact cement applied to the whole cardboard tube, around which the sisal was wrapped. I'm going to look into the glue safety some more and see if I can't get something similar. "
1118,Should I be concerned about my egg bound betta?,"I think my female betta is egg bound. We don't have a male, and aren't looking to breed. Do I need to be concerned or will this pass naturally? Is there anything I need to do to make sure she'll be okay and ""pass"" the eggs?  Update: There were no eggs and the fish died. I'm still not sure why. "
1119,Is getting pure breed pets from a rescue an option?,"I am interested in a pure breed pet, but I also want to help save a life by getting a rescue pet.  Is it possible to get a pure breed pet from a rescue?  If so what are the considerations?  "
1120,Why does my dog drink the other dogs pee?,"We live in a home with three other dogs. We have a nice backyard and a doggie door, and all the animals know how to use it, but for some reason we can't get two of them to stop peeing inside the house. One is going senile, and the other is a younger boy we think is competing with our newest addition, a 4 year old pomchi. Well, my problem is that for some reason my 4 year old keeps DRINKING the senile girl dogs pee. I've seen him both licking it up after she's peed in the house as well as right underneath her leg as it's literally coming out. It's the weirdest thing... I don't think he does it with the other dogs-- these two always play together and you know do the dirty if they can get away with it. Is it like a sign of affection? Or what's going on here? My dog himself is very well house trained and we have never had an issue of him going in our room, only when he first moved in did he really mark the furniture but he eventually stopped. I've never seen him drink his own urine, just hers... We just adopted him about a year and a half ago and I know he was neglected in his previous home. Not sure if improper training has anything to do with it. Any insight on why he's doing this and suggestions on how we can get him to stop are greatly appreciated.  "
1121,Cat always tries to press her head against the brush,"When grooming my girlfriend's cat with a brush, she very often tries to push her face into the brush. The previous brush was rectangular and she would aim with her nose at one corner of it. I had the impression that she tries to clean her nose with it.  Now we have a couple curry combs lying around and once tried one of them to brush her. The cat seems to really like those but still tries to push her face and head against the brush. I also scratch her behind the ears, but she will always try to catch the brush and push against it. Trying to brush her sometimes becomes impossible as she will force her head between the brush her and her other fur.  And this does not stop after a couple times, she does that on and on, like this:  [website]Is she trying to tell me something and I just do not get it? Or does she just like that sensation? Is there anything I should do differently? "
1122,Are Labrador Retreiver typically stoic?,"I have a neutered 2 y/o Male yellow lab. He constantly wants to be around the family and comes up on the couch like he is a lap dog. He comes up onto our bed every night. However, I don't often see him wagging his tail or licking the kids. He just likes to sit next to us and put his head on our lap.  This is very different from our 5 y/o German Shepherd who loves to give kisses and seems to be always wagging his tail. Is this just how Labs are? Are they sort of stoic?  I just want to make sure nothing is wrong with him.  Edit: Is it possible he is depressed?  "
1123,House training a pound puppy,"Not an exact duplicate because of my puppy's background.  So, I have an almost one year old puppy, some sort of Chihuahua+Terrier mix (8 lbs). I adopted her when she was 8 months old, and was advised that she had been moved from pound to pound (as an ambassador for events and such) for 5 months, meaning by the time she was 8 months old she'd been living in a shelter for most of her life. Nothing is known about her life before the shelter, so it's entirely possible that by the time she came into my life there had been no attempt at house-breaking her whatsoever.  So, now I have a one year old puppy whom I've been trying to house train for 4 months with little to no effect. She won't go to the bathroom in her crate (that's where I feed her), so that's a plus, but she seems to prefer to go in the house than to go outside. I'll wake up or get home and immediately take her from her crate to outside, where she'll pee and poop if I'm lucky. Typically she'll just run around until I have to bring her back in, at which point she'll immediately run off and poop in the corner. It might also be good to point out that she's on restricted water (only while eating or after exerting herself), but she still manages to pee... a lot.  She knows that she shouldn't be doing it, because she'll never do it if she knows I can see her and when I do find it she cowers/hides (even though I've never been aggressive towards her or even yelled).  What can I do? What's the trick? I'm starting to worry she'll never be housebroken. "
1124,How to proceed with a pet snake that starts jabbing when held?,"I was considering adopting a milk snake. She's 5 ft. long and the first time I held her she was very friendly, wrapping herself around both my arms, and mostly staying in that position. I held her for several minutes, slowly wrapping her around the other arm as she gradually moved around and uncoiled herself.  The second time I met her though, she moved much faster, and made two sudden movements of jabbing. But she was jabbing away from me (at no one). (What does that mean?) As she was moving faster, it was harder to keep her coiled around my arms, so I brought her closer to my chest, at which point she wrapped herself around my neck. This was fine, until I felt a sharp pain in my cheek just under my ear. My friend had to pry the snake's jaws open with her fingers, and she was very upset, saying she's had the snake since it hatched and had never seen her bite anyone. She also said the snake was supposed to be fed yesterday and was probably very hungry.  Today I ventured to hold the snake again. Almost immediately though, the snake started jabbing again in random directions. I quickly gave the snake back to my friend, and she quickly and tightly coiled herself around my friend's arms. Then my friend tried holding the snake close to my arm for a few minutes to let her get my scent. The snake however burrowed into my friend's sweater.  If the snake feels threatened by me, how should I proceed to make her feel safe? Is it possible? Why was she so friendly the first time, but not the others? Are snakes (or milksnakes) very unpredictable or moody? "
1125,What can cause dark pigmentation on the tip of budgie's beak?,"I have a female budgerigar whose beak recently changed colour - its tip turned brownish-black. There are no bulges on the beak, nor does she have any other symptoms.  I previously had a budgie whose behaviour changed dramatically as it was traumatised after a visit to the vet, so I'm rather scared of taking this one anywhere.  What could cause this beak discoloration in my budgie? Is there something I can do to help her, aside from taking her to the vet?  Edit: She is between 1 and 2 years old. I give her a commercial mixture of bird seed, consisting predominantly of millet (78%) and other types of seeds. I also give her a commercial mixture of parrot minerals.  The beak pigmentation looks like this:   "
1126,Understanding and Encouraging Blanket Spelunking,"Of the three cats in my life, the first two were relatively chill, and the latest is by far the most full of energy, vigor, and character.  As an example, the first cat never showed the slightest interest in blanket spelunking1, the second appreciated a good blanket spelunk, but was quickly satisfied she had seen what needed to be seen.  The latest is absolutely obsessed with it.  Ever wrinkle, every corner, every seam- it must be thoroughly explored and examined!  As I continue to adjust to this personality that is so different from what I am accustomed to, I feel like anything I can do to encourage positive outlets of his energy, I need to latch on to.  Blanket Spelunking is right up there on the list, alongside several others.  So first, I want to get inside the cat's head.  This doesn't seem to be a hunting-related behavior, at least not on the surface of it.  I can tell it is fun, but why?  I understand why human kids build forts, but what is the motive for the feline spelunker?  Second, I want to make it more fun and enjoyable.  Hiding toys and treats under blankets would be an obvious step (or would it?).  Are there other things I can do?  Perhaps knowing the motive will make this clearer, but I am asking anyway.    1Just in case I am coining a term the community is not familiar with, Blanket Spelunking is the sport of squeezing ones body under a blanket, then crawling around underneath.

1127,What container holds a 26-pound bag of kibble?,"I would like to transfer the contents of a 26-pound bag of dry dog food from the bag to a more convenient container.  Any suggestions for a container to hold that amount, or a method for finding such a container?  How does one determine if a container is likely to hold an entire bag? Trial and error can be messy.  (This might be useful for other dry pet foods too. Maybe for other dry goods generally) "
1128,Black dark spot on kitten face,"I found this spot on my 7 week old kitten, seems not painful, I tried to clean it using H2O2 it gone but 5 days later appeared again with new spot on noise. Is it an infection? Should I go to vet?  "
1129,Toilet Trained Cat... Almost,"So my wife and I set ourselves to training our cat to use the toilet. Over the course of several months, we performed the following steps and were met with great success.   We moved the covered litter box close to the toilet. We switched the litter out for a soluble brand so it wouldn't wreck our plumbing. We raised the litter box to the level of the toilet. We removed the top of the covered litter box. We moved it on top of the toilet. My wife then molded an aluminum turkey pan to fit inside the bowl of the toilet and filled it with the soluble litter.  We cut a small hole in the center of the turkey pan. Over time, we gradually expanded the size of the hole until there was nothing left for our kitty to stand on but the toilet seat.   Now, all that exists is the shining rim of the turkey pan below the toilet seat.  Our cat has been successfully peeing and pooping in the toilet for about 3 months or so now. That is until this last Christmas. When we put our tree up, it created a nice, little, isolated corner in our apartment. One day I discovered a poop in the corner. Since then, there have been a handful of incidents where she'll poop in the same corner if it's not covered with stuff, or like this morning, she'll poop right in front of the toilet on the mat. It doesn't happen every time, or even half the time, but just every now and then.  I have a hunch that our cat doesn't particularly like the sensation of pooping on the toilet because it splashes up onto her butt. Things that I've read say that if a cat doesn't like their pooping space, they'll pick a different spot. I know there are people who have had complete success with toilet training.  At this point, we're determined to have her using the toilet, so going back to a litter box isn't really an option. Has anyone else had this same problem? And how would you recommend addressing it?    Edit  I have considered using toilet paper to cover the surface of the water. This has proven... from experience... to reduce/eliminate splash entirely, but I don't think it will stay there all day, and I don't think I could train her to put toilet paper over the surface of the water.  This really comes down to whether or not this is just something behavioral that needs extra training/addressing in some other manner, or if there's something creative that can be done to improve her experience.

1130,Rabbits teaching its own friends to drink from drinking bottle,"I have 3 bunnies, I've successfully trained one bunny of mine to drink from drinking bottle, but the others weren't able to do so. Do you think that success one could teach its friends to drink like the way she does? Like naturally? Or I should teach those two with the same method? Thank you. "
1131,Hair shedding from upper body while lower still have long hair,"I have a male kitten, approx 9-10 months old. It is suffering from hair loss. I think it may be due to environmental allergies. Or is it due to something else?  It was shifted to my friend's house for approx 2 weeks and when I got it back, it was healthy with good coat and long hair. But after few days it started losing hair.  I visited vet but I don't think there are any good vets in my city. My vet always suggests me to change cat food brand whenever I pay a visit. Cat's diet was same when it was at my friend's place.  Currently we are feeding him ""Josera kitten food"". Before that we were feeding him ""Royal Canin Kitten food"".  What could be the cause? It has short hair from upper side and longer hair below his body. I don't trust any vet in my city. They are here just to make money.  Need advice. Thanks. "
1132,I'm wanting to have a female Betta sorority and Corydras- would that be over crowding?,"I have a 3ft tank, it's been cycling for about a week so far. We want to have a female Betta sorority(at least 5 females) and at least 2 bottom feeders (Corydras). Would this be considered overcrowding?  Yes the tank is underplanted for a sorority and I intend to get some tall growing plants for the back. I want a fairly neat looking plant to go with  the tank. Perhaps Jungle Vallisneria?   "
1133,Does store-bought coral come from coral reefs?,"While I'm not currently thinking of building a salt-water tank, I might do after a few years of experience.  I've seen a lot of YouTube videos and online tutorials that feature different coral setups in their tanks.  They sure look nice, but where does the coral that is in stores come from?   If they're coming from the ocean (The biggest aquarium of all :D) and already-depleted coral reefs, it would seem a bit unethical to me.  Is it possible that there are suppliers that farm coral? I don't know much about coral but it seems like it would take a long time. "

1135,First time beta owner please help,I have a male beta for a month now.he was in a small tank and was just upgraded to a tl2 gallon tank with a filter and I also added a heater.i knew he was unhappy in the cold dirty tank he was in so when I got the new tank I was anxious and added him in the new tank within ten minutes of setting it up.i didn't know you wernt suppose to do that.i have never owned a fish.he was very happy the first day but now he is not eating and he is literally laying at the bottom of the tank.his color is also very dull.i am afraid I am slowly killing him because of adding him to the new tank so quickly.i don't know when or how much I should change this water but all I know is my fishy is not ok.could I of put him on the path of death.?? Please help anyone... thank you 
1136,Cat bites my face at night and when he seems happy,"I just got two 6 months old brother male kittens, both neutered and vaccinated. One of the two, the smaller one Gintoki, keeps biting lightly whatever he can of my hands, arms, neck and my wife's as well. Most of the time it is barely anything and I understand he's not doing this to be mean as he is most of the time purring when he does that, that I'm not exactly sure how to react to it since I know it can create bad tendencies as he will grow older.  Now that's not too worrying for now as we only had them since last Sunday(18-03-18), but now the issue is that Gintoki and the other slightly bigger Jotaro come at night in bed and are both biting our faces: e.g. ears, nose, jaw, chin. Once more they don't sound mad again as they are purring and not especially trying to attack us. We are going to start keeping our room's door closed at night, but is there anything else we can do? Can this be something only temporary? Will it make the two kittens hate us? As you can see I'm quite worried.  [EDIT] We haven't seen that they are biting more than before and the door was left open except for one night were we closed it for 5 minutes and Gintoki would meow loudly so that wasn't going to happen. I'll see to try what the response advised me and see how that goes.  Update Now what I have been able to deduce is that they bite our face during sleep because they want to be fed. And that they prefer to bite my face with or without a light beard. They never really hurt me, and I have been able to sleep better by providing them a bit of food before sleeping (they will come back just a bit later). "
1137,"My cat is stressed, can it come from my depression?","I have an old cat (16 years old), since two weeks she frantically licks herself until she pulls completely her hairs.  I brought her to the veterinarian and he said that she is probably stressed.  After looking for recent changes, I have found nothing that could cause this.  The only hint I see is that I have depression since few months, I wonder if she can feel it. Can cats feel bad emotional states? Is there a way to hide it from them? "

1139,What size should a dog toilet area with weekly cleanup be?,We want buy a bearded collie {40–60 lbs (18–27 kg)} and want to have a designated dog toilet in the garden. What size should it be if we plan to scoop poop once per week?   Anything else we should consider for the dogs comfort and to reduce odor? 
1140,Kitten hurt from bite/scratch developed swelling and bald spot on head. Has she got some disease?,"My kitten had hurt herself and was bleeding in the neck a few days ago. I'm not sure of what caused that but I doubt it may have been bitten or scratched by some other feral cats of street. From few days, she has started to lose hair on the head and now it's almost a bald spot.Her head is swollen also. She isn't eating properly also. I'm worried for the kitten and my family's worried for me. They say it's not safe to keep her at home anymore as she may have developed some contagious disease as one of our old neighbors had died from a cat bite, but I don't want to send her away.  What should I do?   What's the reason for that baldness?  Will even accidental scratch/bite from her cause diseases to humans?  Is that bite/scratch on her neck too serious issue?  Note: There are no veterinary doctors near our place. "
1141,What problems does inbreeding with chickens cause?,"I have a big farm (without animals so far) and want to get chickens. They can run freely in the farmyard and the garden, having approx. 1500 m² with grassland, sand, a dunghill and copse. I'd like to take an egg or two sometimes, but they should merely be left to their own, including the brood. As I don't want to get more than one rooster I'm worried about incest and harms I could inadvertently cause the animals by it.  Can I breed multiple generations with one rooster only? Can inbreeding have negative effects, cause diseases or disabilities? If so, is there any rule of thumb after how many generations I should get some foreign chickens – or maybe just a rooster? – to introduce new genetic material? "
1142,(Re)introducing a new dog,"Until yesterday, I had two dogs living in two different houses. A 4-month Dobberman puppy and an 8-month half black lab (we don't know his exact breed). Today was supposed to be the day when they finally met and became friends.  I probably started wrong right off the bat by not doing any research and putting them together immediately at the lab's house. The Dobberman was afraid at first but then they started playing. There was a little trouble as the lab is slightly bigger and would kind of tackle the Dobberman, leaving him off balance.  After running around for a while, they begun to play fight. I (and all of my family) assumed this was ok and let them go on. When there was growling and barking we separated them for a few seconds then let them resume. This went on for many hours. Now that it's sleeping time, we are afraid of what they might do to each other without surveillance. The first idea was to lock the lab, but it looks like it won't work.  So, here are my questions on the situation:   Did I do the introduction wrong? Will I need to introduce the dogs to each other again? Should the dogs be allowed to play fight? What should I do in times when I can't keep constant vigilance?  "
1143,How do you keep your household pet/s away from your toy collections?,"I own a small companion, a mixed Pomeranian and Lhasa Apso breed. Don't let his size fool you, that little bugger can be ferocious at times, chewed off the head of my beloved Snake Eyes (G.I. Joe) action figure. I learned my lesson and was wondering if you guys can recommend anything? I was looking online and found a few wood pet gates. They seem like they would be able to keep him away from the living room (where I usually keep my collection). What do you guys think? And how do  you keep your pets away from your action figures?   "
1144,Introducing harness/leash training to cats in a new space,"My two indoor kitties have stayed with me in a second floor, 540 sq ft apartment for two years, and enjoyed watching birds outside safely from the balcony. Perhaps letting them get used to a bit of the outdoors via balcony was my mistake, but they loved it.   I'm moving to a single-level, 330 sq ft cottage in the next week, however, and I worry about their restlessness. The windows are not as ideal for bird watching, and they'll no longer have a balcony to go outside on. I also worry about restlessness in the significantly smaller space (although I am very good about playing with them every day... otherwise I don't sleep, haha). I'm thinking it would be cool to  harness train them so I can take them into the yard with me for an engaging experience.  I have one boy and one girl cat, both 3 years old decently active and at ideal cat-weight. I have put them in harnesses a few times and, while it's not their favorite thing (boy-cat forgets how to move normally), they don't do too bad.  So my question is If I begin harness training for walks when I move into the new space, will that be beneficial or disadvantageous when trying to teach them?   More specifically - In my head, I imagine that if I start  harness/leash training them immediately when placing it in the new space will ""normalize"" it for them. ""Oh - this is a new space and these things happen when I'm in this space."" Alternatively, maybe doing so will make them hate the new space, which would be the exact opposite of what I'd want.  Any thoughts on if this is a good or never-do-this-ever type of idea? Any experiences?  "
1145,"Fish keep dying, rogue homicidal fish or is my filter too powerful?","I have a 36 gallon tank with an Aqueon® QuietFlow Aquarium Power Filter 55/75. as of now there are 2 red minor tetras and 4 neon tetras. I had another red minor tetra and 4 more neon tetras that all died over the last week. (There were a couple more that died the week before).   I used to have the 30 gal version of the filter, but it didnt seem to be able to keep up and the algae got out of control. I did a 50% water change, upgraded the filter to the 55/75 version and soaked all the decorations in bleach (and rinsed them off well after). It cleared up the water very well and the new filter seems to be working well.   About a week after I did the cleaning I got the new fish and since then they seem die off about 1 per day. Within a day of putting them in the tank, I notice that a couple of the neon tetras seem to have bits of their tails missing. Then about once a day I see a dead fish (almost always a neon tetra) thats sucked up against the Is this a case of an overagressive red minor tetra and they only get stuck by the filter after they die, or could my filter be too powerful and they get sucked up into it and not being able to swim away?  Edit: One thing I forgot to mention is that I got a water test done at PetSmart and they mentioned that the only issue is the Ph seems a bit low and I should do a 25% water change, could that be the issue? "
1146,How to make a cat remember where did he placed his toys?,"My cat is 4 months old now. He always takes his toy off the bed, and once he doesn't want to play, he left his toy somewhere and just forget it.  And when he wants to play with his toys, which I completely have no clue where they are, he meows loud at me and even at night he would jumping like a husky dog on my belly, blaming me why the toys don't automatically appear on the bed.  Is there a way to let my cat remember where did he leave his toy? Would intelligence improving toys help? "
1147,What does a horse need in terms of land?,"I grew up in a suburban area. Our next door neighbors had horses on a half-acre of land, and they seemed fairly happy. If I were to take care of horses, how much land would I need for them to have a healthy life? Does it depend on the type or number of horses? "
1148,How to take care of fish eggs?,"Today I woke up to a glob of jelly with weird yellow dots in them attached to one of my hairgrass. I looked up the situation and I think I have tetra eggs, because my danio minnows and cory cats lay non-adhesive eggs.  So far I have removed the eggs (and the hairgrass leaf it was attached to) from the tank twelve hours ago and put them in a styrofoam bowl. Will they be ok? How long until hatching time? Any signs to look out for? "
1149,Can I feed my cat a vegetarian or vegan diet?,"I have a few friends who are vegetarian or vegan, who have considered putting their pets (mainly cats, which is why I specified in the title) on a similar diet.   I feel like that might not be good for the animal, but I feel like I can't discuss it with them without being throughly educated on the topic.   Is it safe to feed a cat a vegetarian or vegan diet? Why or why not?  "
1150,Adding neon tetras to an existing school - Any concerns?,"I have three neon tetras and I'd like to add some more. My reading on the subject gives me different advice on what is likely to happen.  One outcome is the two sets of neons will not school together, the other outcome is that they will school together, but to varying degrees.   Are there any concerns with adding new neon tetras to an aquarium with an existing school?  EDIT: See my answer below for what happened when I added new neon tetras. See also this related question: how-long-should-i-wait-after-moving-aquarium-before-adding-new-fish? "
1151,Is my two-year old Maine coon too lean?,"We have five cats, four adults and a kitten. Other cats eat well but this one is just keeping slim lean thin like it was a fashion model on a catwalk. She is a Maine coon and just got two years old this month, and I'm getting anxious about her weight. She is a little over 90 cm (3 feet) including tail, and weighs about 3,5 kg (under 8 lb). Wikipedia says an adult female Maine coon should be 10 to 15 lb.  She eats dry food and wet food, just like the others, but ever so small amounts of it at a time. We have dry food on constant offer and wet food two or three times a day. During the first 18 months I told myself that she is just busy growing up, as these Maine coons are slow to build up their body, so she just don't get body mass until she has reached her full size. But our other cats are (slightly) younger than this one, and they're looking like already at their full adult size. So for the last half a year I've been wondering if she is allright.  Half a year ago she was at a vet to get her vaccines and the vet said something about her possibly being in heat every so often, and that consumes a lot of energy. The vet said our cat sure is a bit too lean, but it should change soon after spaying. I don't know, we have plans to let her have one set of kittens before doing that. And we've been waiting for her to grow up before introducing her to a tom. (That's part of it why we now have the male kitten..)  After that talk with the vet I've started buying Royal Canin Exigent 33 Aromatic Attraction food for fussy cats. The slim cat seems to like it, but our other cats love it. So our other cats are gaining weight perhaps a bit too merrily, only because I'm trying to fatten this one.  To sum it up: a two year old female Maine coon is ever so slim, even though she does eat. How slim is normal for this breed? Am I worried for nothing, and if not, what can I do? "
1152,How to train a kitten to climb tail-first down a tall climbing tree?,"We have a tall climbing tree, which has the lowest resting platform quite high up. All but one of cats know how to climb down tail-first, but the 4-month old kitten comes down head-first. Climbing head-first is not easy, so he falls down often. Being that young, I would bet it hurts a bit, but he doesn't seem to mind. Anyway, is it possible to teach a young cat to climb down tail-first?  My idea with the tree was to offer a good continuous climb up without distracting platforms in-between. Should I change the tree / just let the kitten drop himself down like a rock / try to train him to climb down safely?   "
1153,How does a cat's personality change by having kittens?,"I'm pretty sure that having kittens (and nursing them, etc) changes a female cat both physically and mentally. Exactly how it changes the cat is not quite clear to me. To me a female cat that has had kittens seems more ""adult"" than another one who was spayed before ever having kittens.  I have never given much thought to it really. I believe that having kittens is good for the cat, and especially for me, because I don't want my cat to behave like a big kitten all through her adult life.  Getting rid of the kittens has not proven difficult, at least in the country I live in. People will buy cheap cross-breed kittens willingly, especially from a seller like me, who sells clean and healthy vet-checked, vaccined, dewormed kittens. I'm asking for approximately the ""production costs"" price only, so it is definitely not a business to me. The only issue is if I really want to have my cat have kittens at all. At the moment I have one unspayed female cat, so this question is about her. Of all the cats I've ever had I've let two females produce kittens, first in 1988 and second time in 2012.  My question is: How does a cat change after having kittens? What kind of differences there is between two spayed female cats, when one has had kittens and the other one has not? "
1154,How do you safely evacuate with cats?,"Every now and then when some natural disaster hits, I see stories in the press about abandoned pets or people being turned away from emergency shelters because they have pets with them, and I think: ""I don't want to be those guys"".  I live in an area that isn't prone to disasters, but that doesn't mean that I'll never find myself in that situation.  I know that, just as for people, one needs to have an emergency kit with food, water, (litter in the case of the cats), anything medically needed, supplies, and so on.  I'm not asking about the contents of the emergency kit.  Rather, what I want to know is: suppose disaster strikes and I load up the cats (in carriers) and the gear in a car and get as far away as possible.  What now?  How do I find emergency housing that will take me and them?  Or is my best bet to drive as far as possible and look for friends/relatives/inernet people?  If it's frigid winter or very-hot summer we can't just live in the car for the duration, after all.  So my question is: what should I do (a) in advance and (b) during the emergency to ensure a safe place for my pets? "
1155,How can I know if my cat is in pain?,"When a cat is sick, it is often quite obvious to its owner, but sometimes it is not so clear. What if the cat was in terrible headache or suchlike? What are signs to look for when I suspect my cat is in pain, but is not bleeding, drooling, vomiting, walking erratically or showing other obvious signs? "
1156,What should I do to know that my dog will be safe if I go on vacation,"What should I do to know that my dog will be safe if I go on vacation? Sometimes I go on vacation and I leave my dog at home. What should I do so they will be safe and not scared? On New Year's there are fireworks that scare them, old food can't be removed, new water can't be poured, and other things could happen. "
1157,Can a bottom feeder (pleco) clean and or get nutrients from a fish tank filter?,"So I have a 15 gallon fish tank at home with just a couple fish and a plecostomus bottom feeder which does a good job keeping the glass and things clean in there, but obviously I still need to replace my filter every so often as it gets filled with garbage from all the fish in there.  I'm curious, considering the pleco eats all the junk from the fish tank, could I just take the dirty filter, put a clean filter in it's place, and toss the dirty filter into the tank - and if I did would the pleco clean it to even being usable again? Or would the pleco even clean it at all just as a matter of feeding him - would it be nutritional to the pleco?  Is this just silly, or is there some merit to the idea I'm speaking about? "
1158,What cold temperatures are acceptable for 2 to 4 hours for a Sheltie?,"We have a Shetland Sheepdog that we keep indoors. When we leave the house, we put him out, or put him in his crate.  Suppose it is 10 degrees (F) and not wet. Is this a safe temperature for several hours outside? How about 20 degrees? Zero degrees? How do you know?  We have been playing it safe, but he hates the crate, and I don't want to confine him unnecessarily. "
1159,How do I stop my pig from pooping on the concrete?,"I have an 11 month old julienne/pot belly mix (Ham Solo). He weighs about 21 pounds, and is probably fully grown. He gets along well with my 4 year old beagle/bulldog mix (General Grievous - see the pattern?) but I do feed them separately. The pig came house trained, but we could never get him to use the litter box, so we trained him to pee outside. He has no problem going outside through the pet door, and usually follows the dog. We have quite a bit of lawn, and he is good about pooping and peeing on the lawn same as the dog. But he has picked up the habit of pooping in one corner where the side of the house meets the gate. He still pees and poops on the lawn if I carry him out and set him down. What can I do to break his habit of pooping on the concrete? "
1160,How can I move new born kittens if the mother has them in a bad place?,"I have a 50-60 day pregnant cat, which goes freely in and out of the house, but prefers being outside 80% of the time, usually coming in at night to sleep. I read that new born kittens need to be kept warm, and I've seen it suggested that a heating pad be used. Specifically an article stated that the kittens wouldnt be ready for 70-75 degree temperatures until a few weeks of age.  First, is this accurate? I live in Louisiana, USA, a warm climate, so I'm not sure if heating would really be necessary.  I would assume cats are capable of taking care of their kittens just fine without help, but articles I've been reading seem to dictate otherwise.   If warmth is necessary, and my cat chooses to have the kittens outside, which is highly possible, should I move them and if so, how?  If I pick them all up into a box and carry them inside, would that scare the mother?   Also, I live in a x3-wide trailer with an enclosed lower skirted area, where the cat seems to go at night for safety if not yet inside, what if the kittens are had under there where I cant find / get to them, will they be ok? "
1161,Is Feline Diabetes painful?,"My 14 year old indoor/outdoor cat has been diagnosed with diabetes. I travel for my work, so am unable to provide the twice daily insulin injections. But I did change her diet to all protein.  Over the past 3 years she has gotten thinner, slower, and weaker, but still visits for caresses.    Trouble is, she is urinating all over the house.  I try to keep the litter box clean, but my husband is ready to feed her to the coyotes. Even my love for her is laced with resentment at this point.   At what point will she be truly suffering with this disease? How long will she live? I have never put down an animal before and prefer not to, but certainly don't want her to suffer.  "
1162,When is (more) aquarium bio-filtration overkill?,"I have a 75 gallon freshwater aquarium with a pretty heavy fish load (7 giant fist-sized+ blood parrots). But I also have a giant Eheim 1200XLT canister filter running with gallons of various bio media, so my ammonia and nitrites consistently read 0 ppm.   I came across the equipment to essentially build a moving-bed filter.   Will the extra bio-filtration provide any additional benefit for my aquarium?   Apart from the fun of the build, I'm not sure if there is any benefit to a moving-bed filter beyond reducing the (already zero) ammonia/nitrites. "
1163,How can we calm our dog after eating?,"Background  Our dog is a Pitbull/Husky mix. We got him from the kennel where he spent about 7 years of his life (got adopted twice but returned to the kennel a few weeks after), he's been with us for 1,5 years. He doesn't like other dogs or animals (we're doing slow progress on that) but usually loves humans.  He is a very powerful dog with lots of energy. Education was hard at first (lots of exercise and discipline) but we got there with patience and he is much better balanced and calm. He has some rules that he understands and sometimes he tries to break them, we think he is only testing us, nothing special.  However, he gets very excited sometimes. He loves eating, we had to get a special bowl so he doesn't just vacuum the food. When we fill his bowl, he sits down because he knows we only give him the ""eat"" command when he calms down, but he still looks excited and runs like crazy towards the bowl when we tell him to and eats like a maniac.  After eating, he gets very excited. Currently, we're having some work done in the yard, so he is being held by a long leash (on his harness). He doesn't have room to run and just walks around in circles and barks at the sky.  The Question  How can we calm our dog after eating? Sometimes he is calm, sometimes he is excited, that's normal for him and we are glad he is this way. But he always gets pumped up after eating, and we would like to know how we can calm him down (or, if that is the right answer, should we let him release energy or something like that)?  Thanks for your help.  PS: He always eats after going for a walk, morning and afternoon/evening. "
1164,How can I get my cat back to the way he was?,"Okay I got my cat (Yoda) he's year and half. He's  my first cat ever. He always follow me. He is very chatty cat. He love sleeping with me on my bed. Didn't rib things or bite. Well he did like to play bite a lot . And he would always listen when I called his name. Okay so, I had leave for a week so I told my sister take care of him. Yoda was 8 months when he first with out. I wanted him be house cat. But I guess that's not his kind? That's  what my friend told me? His a outdoor cat? But back to story . I left for week . And my sister kept him outside for whole week. So.. I thought it was ok.(Yoda was 10 months when he start leaving outside ) I thought he like outdoors. So I feed him at the front door everyday. Sometime he won't show, so I put food in his bowls. Yoda is a year and 5 months. He gets really scared when I go up to him. He won't let me pick him up. And he bit my sister cause she try pick him up. I always try check him if he have something. So far he doesn't. He still listen when I call his name. But won't come inside. I feel so bad :( . I Shouldn't have left him lived outdoors? How do I make him be the loveable cat he was? Is it possible for him be train again?  "
1165,Should I get my cat spayed/neutered now?,"I'm trying get my cat to be house cat again. But should I get him spayed or neutered first? I know where take him. But I'm scared he bite the doctor? Should I take him? Cause they are professional so they know what to do with cat that bite if it gets scared. Or Should I wait and train him , so he won't bite? I know getting him neutered now will make less irritating.  "
1166,why did my cat stare at me with her third eyelid pulled across?,"For the first time ever, she had her third eyelid, the one that pulls across from the inner corner, about a quarter of the way across both eyes in fact, but I have never seen her face like this, she was staring at me in a new way and not blinking love blinks when I  stroked her or closing her eyes and purring.   One factor might be that I have had to halt her from sitting on my computer keyboard as she altering the settngs in ways that needed a repair, she was getting stroked while sitting on the keyboard, which was hard to handle, so I out a book under the laptop so that she has no flat surface to sit on, one idea that I found on-line that might not be the best solution, after all. Though I sroke her when she  is on the armchair too.  Another factor is that I changed my coloured light-bulb for a white brighter one, an overhead light, nothing in her eyes, no brighter than the kitchen.  She has a suede rug on my desk, the run of my home 100% (bedroom and kitchen, living room, she goes where she wants, sleeps where she wants) food and water, clean litter, petting on offer, which is when she stared so, while on the suede rug, perhaps she is bored of it, but she usually bucks her head back to let me know that she wants me to stop, she scented me, rubbed her cheeks on my jacket. Still, she is not perky, she was like this in the kitchen too, just not herself...  I just want our special bond back. The bond with the love blinks. Maybe I am worrying over nothing and she will change back. Do cats have off days? Is she just growing up? She is four human years "
1167,Is manual flea removal by bath and brush ok for 1 day old kittens?,"This treatment video by a specialist claims manual removal, including washing, is suggested for ""newborn"" kittens. ""Newborn"" would seem to suggest ""one day old is included"" but I just wanted to double check. Is it ok to wash and comb newborn kittens as described in the video?  Also, I've never given my cat, the mother, a bath, and since the video suggests staying away from chemicals in the vicinity of newborn kittens, I have a dilemma as to how I can get rid of the fleas on her also. Suggestions are welcome.  "
1168,How accurate are personality descriptions given by a rescue organization?,"When browsing pets online through many websites like Petfinder, rescue groups will list some personality characteristics (snuggler, good with kids, etc).   How do they determine these personality characteristics and how accurate are these methods?  If methods vary between organizations, how can I tell what basis a particular organization is using so I know how much to trust their characterization? "
1169,How much time should I expect to volunteer at a shelter in order to be useful?,"I was once part of a group that volunteered at a shelter for an afternoon (as part of a community-service project).  But that wasn't very useful to the shelter; they have mandatory training programs for volunteers and none of us had gone through that, so we ended up spending the afternoon at a bunny romp.  That was fun, but I didn't feel like I was helping them -- more like staying out of their way.  (I'd been expecting to spend the afternoon cleaning cages or walking dogs or doing data-entry.)  If I wanted to volunteer usefully at a shelter, how is that time best structured?  I work full-time and have other obligations; would a few hours once or twice a month be at all useful, or is that below the ""thanks for the thought, but..."" line?  What are the typical time commitments that shelters look for from volunteers?  (I realize that I can ask my local shelter about their needs, but that could be an awkward conversation if it turns out they need more than I can offer.  So I'm asking here to get a sense of what's typical.) "
1170,"After getting a pet from an animal shelter, should I take it to the vet for a checkup?","After I get a dog or cat from an animal shelter, is it good practice to take it to the vet for a general-purpose checkup? Or will this have been taken care of by the shelter?  I'm imagining things like parasites or other communicable diseases which might be more of a problem for animals living in close proximity to a large number of other animals. Not to mention general health issues that you would have to take care of normally if you had been owning the pet instead of the shelter owning it. "
1171,Are there rescue organisations for reptiles?,"In the reptile groups I'm active in, I see a number of people trying to rehome their pets or other people's.  All the transactions I see are direct from person to person - sometimes direct from ex-owner to new owner, and other times through an intermediary like another owner or breeder.   Are there any actual organisations that rehome unwanted reptiles? Or do all the animal shelters only deal in dogs, cats and small mammals? "
1172,Can you buy your way to the head of the list to get a pet into a restricted access shelter?,"Restricted access or no kill shelters, limit the number of pets they allow in, and often have strict admission policies that limit intakes to only the most adoptable pets, even with these restrictions there can be waiting lists of weeks or months to place a pet in a restricted access shelter.   If there are hold-ups or issues in placing my pet, is it possible that offering a higher than standard donation will help get my pet in?  How should I go about making the suggest for best impact and how much should I offer?  "
1173,Are shelter pets rejects?,I have heard some people imply that pets at shelters are less than perfect.  Does the fact that an animal is at a shelter mean there is something wrong with it?  Why would an animal be in shelter if there was nothing wrong with it?  
1174,Where to get leg band for parrot in USA?,"I need to travel internationally with cockatiels.  For travel it is often required to have some sort of identification attached to the animal, such as microchips or leg bands.  For birds of this size the only option is leg bands.  Question: Where can I get traceable leg bands for adult parrots in the US?  There doesn't seem to be a standardized system for leg band (codes), nor any centralized database.  I believe USDA only issues leg bands when birds are imported, but not for domestic birds (not 100% sure).  The point is that the leg band I get should be traceable, i.e. whatever USA or foreign authority that looks at it should be able to retrieve information about the bird based on the code.  What are my options?  ACS and NCS sells traceable bands for members (breeders), but my understanding is that these are closed bands only suitable for baby birds.  Once the bird grows up, the band doesn't come off and it's not possible to put on a closed band, so this is not what I need.  (I might have misunderstood something though.)    Update: Based on further research, this question boils down to:   Which reputable organizations in the USA offer open and traceable leg bands?  I found one so far: AFA It would be useful to know what requirements EU countries typically put on leg bands, if any.  While this question is more vague, from experience the USA is notorious for not adopting international standards (e.g. for USA-obtained microchips one usually needs to get a compatible microchip reader when travelling abroad...)

1175,Can pets be allergic to people?,"Lots of people are allergic to different kinds of pets, like dogs, rabbits or cats.  Can a pet be allergic to people? If so is there a treatment? "
1176,neutered male dog fights with intact male dog. Will neutering help?,"We have a male dog who is neutered. He has always been well socialized and has spent a lot of time with other dogs and gotten along great (both male and female).  We adopted an intact male dog and after a week, things have taken a turn for the worse. My neutered dog starting walking around and posturing with his ears pinned back and his hair standing straight up on his back. Eventually the un neutered male has enough of this and they start fighting. I separate them and then things go back to normal for a period of time. The intact male is always the one to finally strike first but I know it is in reaction to the neutered dogs behavior.   My guess is that the behavior I'm seeing in my neutered dog is his reaction to the fact that the other male is intact.  I have scheduled for the intact male to be neutered this week but my question is, how likely is it that this will improve the situation? Has anyone ever had a neutered dog who is perfectly fine around other neutered dogs but acts up around intact dogs?  I don't want to have to give the new dog back but I fear for my safety as well as both animals safety. "
1177,Why does my cat go to the toilet at the same time as I do?,"I have three cats. They live permanently indoors and have 24 hour access to their kitty litter except when I go to the toilet as it is a walk-through toilet and their room is only accessed through there. When I go to the toilet I close both doors because I don't particularly want cats in there with me! One of them either uses the kitty litter or pees in the bath, depending on which side she is on. If she really needs to go to the toilet why does she wait? If she doesn't need to go why does she when I'm in the toilet? When she goes in the bath I can see that it's only a small amount of urine so it doesn't seem that she really needs to go at that time.  Note to Americans: ""go to the toilet"" means ""use the bathroom"" to you. "
1178,Why do adult dogs kill puppies?,"Why do adult dogs kill puppies? Is it because the puppy comes into the adult dog's territory so they kill them.  For many years I've handling my street dogs, one dog is my pet, it is always in my home, other 2 dogs are outsiders. These 2 outsider dogs always kill puppies.  Whenever my own pet's puppy or any other street dog puppy is near or around most of the dogs kill them. Similarly other dogs also kill other dog puppies.  Why don't adult dogs understand that the puppy is a child?  Just last week my puppy was killed by 2 street dogs. I was just going towards it but they killed in just 5 seconds. There was not any injuries on my puppy's body, Doctor told me that they both drilled it's lung, so it died in only 5 seconds. :(  As guided by Zaralynda , I have asked another question of ""how to save them.""  Please See With which treatment we can save puppies beaten by adult dogs? "
1179,What effect does music have on dogs?,"I just had one experiment with some puppies.  I tried to play a flute and what I found was that the first time puppy barked at me. They probably think ""what is this guy doing? Let's bark and let's make him leave our peaceful environment..."" :P  But then at times, after the 3rd day, they run towards me and recognize me, that this is the guy who always comes with flute... They wag their tales and play around me.  Is it that like dogs like music?   I am wondering about exactly what happens when they hear my music. My street dogs becomes excited hearing my tune and runs like mad to come to me. I am actually very happy seeing them loving me like that.  Is it that music makes a pet more careful and peaceful? Because they start sleeping near me. Some times they try to sleep on my feet.  Does A Dog like or enjoy music like us? or they are just feeling ""ok, it is you, I know"" kind of thing? "
1180,How should I respond to questions about current vet when filling out an application for a rescue if I do not currently have any pets?,While I have had pets in the past I currently do not have any and as such do not really have a vet to be a reference for me.  I notice that most rescue organizations include a request for a vet reference in their adoption application.    So how should I address the question of what vet I use?  Is there any thing I can do to demonstrate that I have considered my pets health needs even though I do not have this reference? 
1181,Emergency treatment for puppy with a punctured lung,"If a puppy has a punctured lung, is there anything I can do to keep it alive until we reach the vet?  Because external injuries can be treated by taking the puppy to doctor, but when adult dogs make a hole with teeth into puppy' lung, I have found that they just die in short time (5-50 seconds) and I do not have even time to take it to the hospital, So in such serious cases how can I save them? :(  Any help will be appreciated. Thank You in advance.  Edit:  GOD just saved one more street dog today by me by pumping it, fortunately it's lung was not holed, but it was forced from height and force towards one marble stone. It tried to get up but could not, it left control of body.  It started dying and its tongue came out of its mouth, I had seen people forcing chest of humans. So I did the same with the dog with chanting of holy name of GOD. The dog vomited and came back to life. It was so happy moment for me. I fed it little water, it is alive. Yes it is scared and was lucky that its case was different from lung hole. But immediate treatment of chest pushing helped me this time. I thank GOD especially for his compassion. I took it to hospital even after 15 minutes... But yes he is alive today. :)   I am wondering if I would have done the same with my puppy, it would be alive. :(   f we put our fingers on lung hole will it work? Does pumping work in punctured lung case? What emergency treatment should I do?  But I shared this one because this treatment worked for me today.  "
1182,Why is it that many rescues charge more for adoptions than I could get a puppy for from a breeder?,"I often see ads on Facebook and Craigslist for mixed breed puppies in the $50-100 range but it seems most rescues have fees that are 200+.  I would think that a rescue organization would want to save more animals, but when they charge more isnt that self defeating?  So why do they charge so much more? "
1183,Full Spectrum LED(400nm~840nm) vs Grow Light LED (RED+BLUE),I'm planning to buy lights for my planted aquarium tank. After a small research I found that regular lights are not suited for growing plants. Beacuse they need BLUE for Leaf Growth and RED for Stem Elongation.  In stores I found 2 variants of this lights. One was actually a combination of both the LED's and other was simply called Full Spectrum LED. Can any one please suggest me which one is good for my 6 gallon tank?  I got  Eleocharis Paravula (Japanese) Ludwigia sp Mini Red  Elatine Triandra   For Ref:  Full Spectrum LED  : [website] Grow Light LED         : [website]
1184,Spacing for fence slats - small dog,How far apart can fence slats be spaced and still safely contain a small dog - specifically a toy poodle?  Are there measurements that I could take on her to figure out the spacing? 
1185,"How do I stop my male cat from ""controlling"" and attacking my tiny female cat?","I have a female cat(Annie) who is not spayed and a male(Felix) who who is neutered. Annie is very tiny and has no claws. Ever since I got Felix he is always chasing after Annie or preventing her from eating her food, using the litter box, going in to certain rooms(my bedroom). Annie has since started to pee on our laundry and towels. I have tried giving her UTI meds but that did not work. I think she is super stressed out because he will not stop. We also just moved into a new house so we would like this to stop so she does not pee around the new house.   How do I stop him from constantly pestering her?  Would it be because she is not fixed?  "
1186,Snake refusing food after escaping,"My 4 year old cornsnake escaped and was lost for about 10 weeks. I finally found him about 3 weeks ago.  Since he's been back he has been refusing to eat. He's more active than he was before he escaped - constantly prowling the viv looking for a way out so I don't know if he's just unsettled but unless he found something when he was out, he hasn't eaten for over 3 months.  I can now see a ridge where his spine in which I don't recall being present before.  He's always been a good eater other than when I first got him when he took about a month to start eating.  When should I start to worry? Should I take him to see the vet? "
1187,cat has a swollen area after a cat attack,"My cat got into a fight with another cat and ever since that day, she's been acting off. The day after the fight she slept in the same chair for the whole day (over 14 hours). I also noticed that she is purring way more, so when you go to pet her, she'll purr immediately. She has not been active and does not show as much of an interest in food.   I also found a swollen area on her lower back, the part that is right above the base of the tail. It was swollen for about a week and she wouldn't let me touch it, like she would meow and move, right away. This morning, i noticed some pus-like white residue on that section of her fur.   Is my cat alright? Will this swollen area heal by itself? Is there anything I should know about this? "
1188,How potty train a 2.5 months old puppy?,"I have a 2.5 months old Golden retriever and I am house training him for past 1.5 weeks. Every 2 hrs once I take him to his designated area to pee and he does it. But if I miss, he doesn't even call me or give an idea that he is about to pee and pee whereever he is (even near the place where he sleeps).  Also I could see that he doesn't sniff before peeing and if I lift him while peeing and drop him in the designated area, he stops peeing for a long time.   So, why does my pup doesn't still knows that he has to pee only in the designated area?  On the other hand, pooping is a difficult task as he does that on different times every single day and I have no clue how to make him schedule it.   Does this both behaviors are due to he is a puppy?  One more thing, we wash the designated area most of the time to avoid stinking. Thus this is an issue? "
1189,Fact or fiction- Have I ruined the chance to teach my cockatiel to talk?,"I have a young male cockatiel. He's about 7-8 months old. He mimicks all sorts of whistles already like the wolf whistle, pop goes the weasel, charge!, and part of Darth Vader's entrance song, he even whistles along while I play the piano (not always the right notes but sings part of chops when I sit at the piano bench before I even begin) .... He doesn't mimick ANY words I repeat regularly to him, hi bird, pretty bird, his name- Joey, goodnight, kiss kiss etc.. His crest goes up and he cocks his head so I know he's listening and is interested And I know it's easiest for them to learn two syllable words but he won't. It sounds like he's trying. Sometimes it sounds like muttering almost like the adults in the Charlie Brown cartoon.   A long time ago I was told if you teach your Cockatiel how to whistle that they will most likely not learn to talk, that they're more content with what's easiest and THAT will become they're way to communicate with you. Has anyone heard of this? Is this true? Any insight or advice helps. I cannot find any online info supporting this either way about cockatiels. I've even found sites saying they will never talk which I know isn't true, so I'm stumped. Why won't he mimick words and phrases? "
1190,Where can I install a pet door?,Can a pet door only be installed on a door?  What are the other places to establish that might be suitable for a beagle? 
1191,Cat poops on the floor by the catflap overnight,"We have 2 cats and they're pretty well behaved, toilet-wise. They are allowed out during the day, but we keep them in overnight as they're black cats so would be hard to see if any cars go past.  For the past few months or so though when we've come down in the morning there will be a pungent, sloppy pile of cat poop right in front of the catflap. Their litter trays are literally about 30cm away from the catflap, yet the poop will be there on the floor. it happens so often that we've started moving the litter tray over to the catflap overnight. So now we get the poop in the littertray, but the cat never buries this one - they clear a space in the tray and drop it there, not covering it up at all.  This means our house stinks every morning, which is not great.  I've been looking into why they might be doing this, but can't find any reason. Possibly they're worried that a neighbourhood cat is going to come in overnight or something so are marking the area as a deterrant? But cat's would usually spray for that, not poop. Plus the catflap is chipped and locked overnight, so no cat would ever come in. They're happy cats, and show no signs of illness or distress, so we're a bit at a loss of why they're doing this.  Why are we getting these overnight poops, and how can we stop it? "
1192,Could my gravel be causing my tank to be cloudy?,"I have several freshwater aquariums a 5 gallon, a 10g, x2 20g, a 29g, a 55g and an outdoor 300 gal pond. Aside from the pond, I started with one community tank and now have a rescue tank, a neon breeding tank, and the others are holding tanks for my babies at different stages (the neon tetras, balloon mollies, and fancy guppies just won't stop multiplying!) All of my tanks get weekly partial water changes, get tested with a master test kit once a week, but vary in salinity the tanks purpose and decoration- natural vs artificial plants.   All tanks have natural gravel except one. One of my 20g tanks has black gravel. I have no live plants in this tank, just two micro Cory cats(edit*Pygmy Cory cat) and guppy babies. It's regularly cloudy, and yet the maintenance I perform on it is the exact same as the rest. I have Zero fish loss, and my ammonia and nitrites never reaches higher than .25ppm mg/l and my nitrates never reach 5.0 ppm mg/l (usually test results between 0 and 5). All of my tanks have been running for 4+ years and I haven't had a fish die in 2 years, and that was because I accidentally smashed a baby guppy with my gravel vac during a water change.   I change my carbon every other month in all my other aquariums because I prefer to retain as much good bacteria as possible, but 3 months ago started changing this tanks once a month, as directed on the packaging hoping to increase clarity, but no change.   It's aggravating because it's an eye sore, and I would know EXACTLY what to do if it were caused by shock, but it's not. Could this be because of the black gravel? It was rinsed before the tank was set up, but that was forever ago. I have concerns about doing a 100% water change, and starting from scratch since my fish are in such great shape. Has anyone had this happen to them before, where all parameters were fine but the tank was cloudy? I'm stumped! HELP.  Sorry for the book, I just wanted to put as much background info as possible. "
1193,Platy has been pregnant for over a month,"I’m wondering if anyone can help me?  I have a platy that seems to have been pregnant for over a month. I’m starting to wonder if she is sick, constipated, or if the male we have in the tank is stressing her out. Her scales appear smooth, no visible illness, but she’s been chasing the male back recently and taking herself off away from him.  We have the pregnant female platy, male platy and two shrimp in the tank.   I only recently discovered that the place we got the fish from should’ve sold us two females to one male, I don’t know if that makes any difference, but until today he had constantly followed her around the tank.  From what I’ve read, I don’t really fancy putting her in a breeding box and stressing her out, so would moving the male to a separate tank be a kinder option? Also, I haven’t got any peas in at the minute, but I do have broccoli that I can give her to see if that’ll make a difference.  I am still learning about platys and platy care but I know from reading this and other forums that you guys are better to ask than the place we got them from.   Any help would be great :)  "
1194,How can I keep my dog from going stir crazy while recuperating?,"A couple of days ago, my dog cut the pads of one of his paws. It was pretty nasty, but really not too bad. We took him to the vet to get it wrapped up and the vet recommended that he rest and take it easy.  This makes sense. Any time he steps on the foot, it is going to reopen the wound. Running around will be worse. The problem is that we are normally out running around or playing at the dog park for an hour or more everyday. He's a husky with plenty of energy.  My little guy is going to go nuts if he can't out for walks or for play for 2 weeks. Then he's going to drive me nuts!  Anyone have any strategies, games, treats, toys, foods or something else that has helped them in the past through a similar situation? Is there such a thing as puppy-xanax? ;) "
1195,The curious case of the cannabis cat?,"I have a 7-year-old British shorthair cat that sleeps next to me every night. I vape cannabis oil as a sleep aid a few times a week, usually while reading or watching a movie just before sleep. I do my best to exhale away from his general direction but he noticeably smells it. I usually keep the windows open and he definitely doesn't seem to mind it (always stays, never runs off, no obvious adverse reactions).  Occasionally he will actually get up to smell(breathe?!) the vapor that I exhale. I usually shoo him away from it.   How are cats affected by second-hand cannabis oil vapor? Are there any adverse effects on my cat's temperament and/or health? Should I be shooing? Am I an irresponsible cat-dad? "
1196,"Puppy potty training, should we keep using pad or crate dog to reinforce only outside potty","My 9 week old puppy knows to use a pad inside but she goes frequently (she wont wait till we go outside again to pee), i know she can hold it as she has held it through the night (6 hours) , but when we are around the house she still likes to pee a lot unless she is in her crate. Will she start holding it more and more throughout the day as she gets older? Should we crate her after 30 minutes so she holds it longer? We prefer not to as we are around, but she will go pee whenever she feels like it.   Thanks "
1197,Betta laying at bottom of the tank,"I got a male betta yesterday, and moved him into his 2.5 gallon tank today. I read multiple sites that said it was okay to move him within 24 hours of setting the tank up. The filter is working, and the heater is too. The temp says it is 78 degrees F. We put the conditioner in the water when we filled the tank up yesterday, so it sat for 24 hours with the filter on. I also checked the pH, nitrate, nitrite, and a few other factors of the tank which all came back as perfect. We moved him into the tank like we were supposed to, and he seemed to assimilate nicely to the new tank. When I sit by the tank, he usually comes straight up to me and then swims around. There's only one plant in there for him now, but I will be getting more tomorrow. I got the silk fake plants recommended for Bettas. I left the light on in the tank and turned the light off in my room, leaving him for about an hour. Half an hour in I checked on him and he was by the filter (he was just hanging out by it, it's not too strong and he wasn't stuck). Then when I came back in a half an hour later he was in the corner of the tank between the plant and wall. He was laying on the gravel between the two, not stuck though. It took him a minute, but he swam up to me and now he's swimming around okay. Is this normal for them to do? His fins look alright, and he doesn't appear to be breathing rapidly or have an ich on him. I've fed him flakes today, which he doesn't go for immediately but he will eat them. I'm getting pellets soon also. Is he just stressed from the move, or is there something more serious going on? This is the first betta I've owned so I just want to make sure he's doing okay and nothing else is happening to him.  "
1198,"My snake has started shedding, but seems unwilling/unable to finish","I have a juvenile corn snake. This is her second shed with me so far, and the first went very easily. This time, however, she seems to be unwilling or unable to fully work her skin off. On Thursday night I first noticed that she'd begun to shed, and she'd successfully worked off the skin on her head and the base of her neck. (It looked very clean, and from what I can tell both eye caps came off.) From my experience with the previous shed I assumed she'd work the rest of it off over the course of the night. Since then, however, she's made no further progress at all--it's now Saturday morning here, and she still doesn't have her shed any further down than the spot on her neck near her head. I can tell she's not completely inactive, since she's moved between her hot and cool side hides, but instead of rubbing up against the rough objects in her tank she seems to only be hiding inside one hide or the other.   I'm beginning to get very worried--am I correct that this is longer than a snake should take from the beginning of the skin peeling off to having the full shed loose? (I see lots of resources online for how long it should take from blue phase to shed, but none for how long the shed should take.) And if so, what actions should I taking here? About fifteen minutes ago, upon waking up, I made a moist hide out of Tupperware and paper towels; she's in that currently and I'm hoping it will help, but I'm not sure what further I can do.  For further details: she ate two pinky mice last Sunday, her hot side is 84 degrees, her cool side fluctuates slightly but generally is around 70-75,her humidity is and has been at around 35-40%. Other than the usual pre-shed shyness I haven't noticed anything unusual about her behavior lately. "

1200,What is the best way to clean soil substrate in my aquarium?,I recently set up a tank for a Betta sorority (I'm letting it cycle till we have everything) and as a substrate we have dirt. I was under the impression we just clean it like sand using a wider gravel vac but I was told you don't use a siphon  / gravel vac as it would suck it all up?   What is the best way to clean soil substrate in my aquarium?   
1201,How can I make my cat less lethal?,I‌ get extremely annoyed when my cat comes back home with a beautiful dead bird (as it happened an hour ago).   There is a flap door in our house so the cat is free to go out. We don't wish to confine the cat inside. So please do not suggest that.   I'm wondering what are the most effective and humane ways to make hunting as difficult as possible for him? (cutting his nails short? hanging a bell on his neck? shouting at him? etc.) 
1202,Will my cats properly settle down after taking them back to their old home?,I moved south just over 2 weeks ago with my 2 cats.    I now know that the place is not for me. So I am moving back within a week!  Are my cats still familiar with their home and territory back there? Will they properly settle down over there after this short gap? I can understand that they are not happy here. 
1203,Is silica sand cat litter dangerous to use?,"I'm seeing various articles on the web claiming that silica sand may be harmful to humans / cats, especially when inhaling the dust it creates.     Quartz silica (sand), the other ingredient in most clumping litters,   is a known carcinogen for both humans and household pets when inhaled.      Source:   [website]This question was posted in 2010, so 9 years old already, maybe there's more literature on the subject by now?     I sometimes worry about breathing in the dust from cat litter. Have   there been any studies or are there any health concerns on the danger   of breathing in litter dust, either for me or my cats?      – APRIL 15, 2010      [website]This one says research has shown without pointing to the actual research ...     sadly, silica litter puts our feline counterparts at risk whenever   nature calls. silica dust can be kicked up and inhaled by both cats   and humans. what’s worse, silica crystals often stick to cats’ paws,   and the dust frequently settles on their fur, leading to ingestion   whenever a cat grooms itself. and while many clay litter users still   aren’t fully aware of the dangers associated with crystalline silica,   the research is decidedly more certain.      [website]Another one from a somewhat more reputable-looking site     Crystalline silica cat litter is one of the newest types of absorbent   litter on the market. It works by absorbing your cats urine and   ""drying"" it eliminating the smell and keeping the litter dry. This   type of litter is quite popular due to it's ease of use. However, some   health concerns exist. Silica Cat Litter Concerns Silica dust contains   silica particles and is a known human carcinogen according to the   International Agency on Cancer. Breathing in this silica dust may pose   a health risk to you and your cat.      Prolonged exposure to crystalline silica dust has been associated with   silicosis (a non-cancerous, sometimes fatal lung disease), bronchitis   and tuberculosis in humans.      In cats, inhaling the silica dust can cause respiratory infections. If   your cat ingests the silica while cleaning its paws, the silica may   accumulate in your cat's intestines over a period of time causing   health problems. When ingested, the litter will expand and absorb   moisture in the intestines preventing the absorption of nutrients as   well as cause dehydration and blockages.      [website]The cat litter i bought for our new kitten contains silica sand, it's very convenient as it controls odours and lasts for almost a month before having to replace it.    Is there any truth to silica-sand-based-litter-dust being hazardous to human / cat health? (I'm assuming clumping clay is just another word for silica sand or is that actually a different type of cat litter?)  "
1204,Cat’s Tail Only Goes To the Right After Fall,"My male cat (neutered, 13 y/o) fell while I was away two weeks ago. I don’t know how he fell or where. When I came home after being gone for only a few hours he had a noticeable limp and couldn’t lift his tail. We took him to the ER vet who did X-rays, and then to my regular vet the next day (he was injured on a Sunday).   X-rays were all clear as far as breaks/fractures but there was some swelling and he was vocal when the vet poked around his left hip/hind leg. He was given anti inflammatories and pain meds.   It’s been a little over 2 weeks. The limp is gone (I tried to limit his activity as much as possible in the first week or so) he’s not vocal about any pain and everything else about his behavior is totally normal.   But!! I am SO confused about his tail. He couldn’t lift it at all the first few days; it progressively got better and it’s now not exactly totally lifted but a billion times better than it was; however, he is holding his tail completely to the right. When he walks, if I pet him on the back and he does the happy tail lift, it’s still completely to the right. He flicks the end back and forth and isn’t in pain when I touch it, and I don’t feel any lumps or irregularities when I feel it. The photo shows his tail shifted to the right but it’s actually far more right than that most of the time.   What in the world would cause this? Is it possible it will return to normal with time? (I did follow up with the vet, and he said he has no idea why his tail would be like that and we could do more X-rays but there wasn’t much that could be done).  "

1206,What does it mean when my cat makes this noise? (re-post),"Someone posted a question about the noise the cats in THIS video were making, between their regular meow-type noises.   They wanted to know what that noise meant when the cat communicated with them like that. I realized my cat makes the same noise when I speak with her, so I started doing some googling! Cat communication is fascinating to me, so I was excited to answer.  I'd almost finished my answer when the question was deleted, so I'm re-posting the question to the best of my memory (I hope that's okay!)   So, the question is - what  is the loud, mouth closed noise these cats are making, and what does it mean? "
1207,Feeding Geriatric Cat with Hyperthyroidism and Cancer,"My sweet girl is nearing 17 and has been suffering with hyperthyroidism for several years.  Just last year she was also diagnosed with terminal small cell lymphoma in her bowel.  She has previously been on the Hills y/d diet, and it did successfully bring her T4 levels down and eliminate her need for medication, but I've always been pretty upset over the high corn/carbohydrate content of that food.  I was trusting my vet, though, that it was the best course of treatment for her.  However, now with the cancer diagnosis, I was advised to feed her a diet with very low carbohydrate, as carbohydrates apparently ""feed"" the cancer, so she went to a carbohydrate-free diet and back on the thyroid medication.  However, now her thyroid levels are off the charts even with the medication and I was advised to put her BACK on y/d.  OR, only now, when my cat is very old and sick after being hyperthyroid for YEARS, has my vet told me about the curative radioactive iodine treatment being an option.  I would do it without hesitation except that it is VERY expensive, and my poor old girl would have to endure the stress of an hour-long car ride to another city to receive the treatment.  I can't bear to put her through all that when I'm worried the stress alone might do her in at this point.  I don't know how much longer she has, I was told probably less than a year, but I want to do the best I can for her while she's still with me.  In short, my question is this:  since curative treatments aren't really an option for my cat, is there a way to feed my cat a low-iodine, low-carb, high protein, high fat diet?  I've been researching homemade cat food options, but I don't know how to ensure I'm feeding my girl as little iodine as possible.  I've found several websites advising making your own low-iodine cat food instead of using y/d, but I can't seem to find any recipes or specific information on how to do that.  Is it even possible?  I'd appreciate any advice.  "

At the top of this weird piece of extra gum has many little red dots.  My boxer does not complain about anything, I haven't notice an unusual behaviour like if he felt pain, he eats good and normal as always also.  What is it?  Is it just an inflammation?  Is it something dangerous?  Help me please.  Right hand side   Right hand side   Left hand side    Update  We notice that the little piece of extra gum (RHS) has decreased a little.

1210,What's wrong with a cat who appears weak and refuses food?,"On the way home today I saw a stray cat crossing the road so slowly, it seemed like it didn't care if it was hit. I pulled over and tried to pick the cat and take it home but it refused and jumped off. I could feel its bones and it was very thin and feeble.   Assuming it became weak because of lack of nutrition, I went home and brought some milk in a cup but when I tried to feed it, it kept turning its face away. My second thought was to get some meat for it.  My question is what could be the reason it refused the food? What should be done in such a situation? "

1212,What would make a rabbit herd sheep?,"If you search for ""rabbit herding sheep"" you will find multiple links on YouTube and to news organizations like CBS showing a cute little brown (dwarf?) bunny, herding a small flock of sheep.    The flocking behavior of sheep is well known so there is no surprise that they stay together when chased.    Are there any known habits or behaviors of pet rabbits that would make this a semi natural event?     Presumably if it is semi natural behavior, it could be recreated with little difficulty.

Someone mentioned a program called ""Spay and Release"".  It seems like the idea is to capture the cat and have it neutered or spayed and then turn it loose again.  I can understand having a cat fixed, but I don't understand why releasing is a good idea.  Am I misunderstanding? Is this really a good idea?  If a cat has already been spayed and released, do they just keep getting captured and spayed?  "

1223,Are shock collars an effective and humane way of modifying behavior in senior animals?,"We have a 12 yo male /neut Jack R T with no current notable health problems. He has a history of IBS but it's been recently well managed with diet and acid blockers.  He's a wonderful dog: cute, loyal, funny, gentle and trustworthy.   However, this dog constantly, loudly, whines. It's completely behavioral and to myself it's very debilitating. My wife and I have two babies on the way. We're in a small place, I need to get the loud high pitched whining noises to stop. At a point of desperation I'm willing to even try a bark collar (shock collar) and Im looking for some experience here with them:  Do bark collars work for older animals to modify behavior (specifically whining)?   Are they considered humane?  Thank you in advance!  Here's more history about our JRT, should it help your answer here:  My wife found him about eight years ago, he was neglected by owner in apt complex, she suspects there was abuse as well. The whining and whimpering has always gone on. My wife is able to be a lot more tolerant of it (I'm ashamed to say)than myself and others.   I moved in about two years ago and brought two cats with me. All the animals get along seemingly well and my wife maintains that there's been no major change in his behavior since I moved in.   Of note he seems to wine more often under the following various circumstances: in the evening, when she and I are together awake in the house, when food is present.  The pitch of the whine is enough to drive most insane. The real concern here is the wife and I are about to have twins (babies) in ~ 6 months. A legitimate concern comes out, I think l, as we live in a small place and if the babies to come will be able to sleep with the whining.  I've never given up on a pet and i'm not about to start.   We've only had two effective treatments: Benadryl worked for a few days. The only other thing that gets him to stop whining is my wife going to bed. He goes up there with her, gets into bed with her, and sleeps.   We have tried some tactics with no success: positive and negative reinforcement taking him out and giving him attention when he's not whining. When he does wine, as consistently as possible we will spray his feet with water from a squirt bottle. We have been doing this fairly consistently for a bout 6 months. He's an old guy though and I don't suspect change in behavior with him will be easy.  I have never used a bark (shock) collar before. They come off as a little much. He's an old guy I don't think it's fair to put him through that.But we're at a tough spot, as it needs to stop. "
1224,Stray puppy wants to eat with its littermates but gets attacked whenever it does,"I usually feed milk to newly born stray puppies as soon as I come to know about their existence in my area. However, when the puppies grow enough, they start fighting.  14 days ago  Recently, among a litter of puppies, I found that one puppy was being beaten by the other puppies. That puppy became sad and for two days it did not drink milk or anything, so I moved it to a different area with a different bowl. But the problem was it was not eating anything.  After 3 days  I took it to the vet hospital and the vet gave it injections and provided a bottle with glucose solution. After the puppy drank from the bottle, it had some energy and started to drink water. For two days I gave it the syrup given by the vet and fed it separately from the other puppies.  After 4 days  After 4 days, it started drinking milk, but it still wasn't eating anything. Unfortunately though it also seemed that it was now strongly interested in making a group with those other puppies again. It started not drinking milk which was given separately in its personal bowl and started going to the bowl provided for the other puppies.  The other puppies, on seeing it, started barking and attacking it again, and it again became distressed. It again started not eating anything and drinking anything.   Because of the syrup medicine, it was starving strongly, and still not drinking the milk that was in its bowl and instead trying to drink from the other puppys' bowl. So all of them were jumping on it and barking. One of them injured it and injured the area near its ear and eye, drawing blood. This happened in my absence but my friend told me what happened. All the puppies are vaccinated.  I now feel that even though I do any medicines it will not work. The glucose bottle never works. I spent a lot of time with the puppy to make it feel safe - it sleeps on my legs, it plays with me, but when it comes for food, it still goes to the other puppies to be bullied. It feels very sad and hungry but still not eating separately and it is still interested in being bullied.  What is more important? Letting the puppy bond with the other puppies, or making sure it eats?    Update: Today, I saw that the puppy was again attacked by the other puppies and was again forced to leave the territory. I made it its separate area, a safe place nearby. It finally ate food separately today, but now it is scared. It still visits the other puppies when we are away. The other puppies do not bark at it unless it tries to eat from their bowl. So the fight is for the bowl, not for food. Today I put too much food in both the bowls - both bowls were full and the food was mostly wasted.  How can we help this puppy? "
1225,Are there any animal charities that focus on preventing pets from being rehomed in the first place?,"Kind of ""prevention rather than cure"" - are there any charitable organisations that work to educate people, supply resources, or whatever else might be needed to stop pets from needing to be rehomed?  If so, how do they go about it?  (I know that if you got the animal from the shelter in the first place, they will educate you and support you so you don't need to bring it back to be rehomed again, but I was thinking more of the general pet-owning public, not that small section of it.)

1227,Betta laying on bottom of floor with no outward signs of illness... why?,"My betta has been in a 6 gallon (23 litres) planted tank with 5 ember tetras and a couple of dwarf shrimp for about 2 weeks now. He and the tetras seem to get along fine (no aggressive signs from any of them) but the shrimp live in fear of the betta so we decided to give him his own tank. Also we have sand substrate and the betta seemed to like to chew and spit out grains so we thought gravel would be better for him.  The new tank set up is as follows: 5 gallon heated to about 75 degrees (24 deg C) with amazon sword, tropical ferns, mopani wood and gravel. Only tank mate is a nerite snail. We used Prime to dechlorinate the water and added API quick start.   After setting up the tank and waiting about 9 hours, we introduced the betta. Less than 24 hours later the betta was laying on the floor of the tank most of the time. The water parameters seem fine, 0 ammonia, 0 nitrites, 0 nitrates, 7.6 pH (same pH as previous tank).   One last thing, the water in the new tank did look a little murky but I don't know why... we cleaned the gravel, boiled the wood and did not feed him in the new tank. (maybe it was due to some tannins leaking from the wood)  We reintroduced him into the old tank today and although he is a bit more active, he still lays long periods of time at the bottom of the tank. We've checked him and doesn't show any physical damage.   If there are no signs of illness why might he be acting this way? Also any suggestions on treatment? Or should we just give him some time?  I really appreciate any insight into my problem with my betta.  "

1229,Is my Shih Tzu puppy underfed? How can I help her?,"We have a ""princess type"" shih tzu (the small type, but not teacup type, which are the smallest), and she's about 4+ months old by now.  To cut the story short, we think we've gotten ill advice on how to feed our puppy and we think we've been giving her way too little food since we got her. (Something like 2 tablespoons of kibbles per meal 2 x day)   We do give her multi vitamins 2x / day as well, and treats every now and then.   Only this week (at 4 months) did we start to increase it to about a small cup /meal x2 day  since she seems bigger now (thinking that the bigger she is the more food she'll be needing).  We are receiving feedback from friends that our puppy seems skinny (underneath that fluffy hair of hers) and they could feel her ribs.   I researched on Google and I was horrified to read that growing puppies need a lot of food to ""properly develop"", up to about 4 months, and even some articles saying to let puppy eat till she is full!! (watching out for those overfeeding of course.)   So this has got me worried.  Should I be worried? She seems healthy and happy and playful and has a strong appetite.   So now I'm thinking about increasing her food a bit more than required to kind of make up for it.  She's about 5 lbs now.   Should we be feeding her more? Are there other things we should be doing? "

1231,What could cause my dog to bite/pull her own hair out?,"The title pretty much says it - my dog, Chewy, has been biting and pulling the hair out on her front arms. Her name was given before this problem started. :)  It's not every day, and I cannot find a pattern but about every week or so I'll come home from work to chunks of hair pulled out around the house (normally all in the same area where she was laying), or wake up to what sounds like carpet being ripped out, which is an awful sound.  This has been happening for probably a year and a half.  About my dog  She is about 2.5 years old and is a Chow/Lab mix. She is honestly the nicest dog I have ever been around and NEVER gets aggressive (I only mention that because I know it is common for Chows to be aggressive/protective).  She was fixed as soon as she was old enough.   What we've done/tried so far   Keep her hair trimmed (especially around her arms/paws) because we thought that the length might be bothering her (and if it were shorter she might not be able to bite it as much). This had little to no effect. Taken her to the vet, several times. The vet thinks Chewy has anxiety issues, which I agree with completely. We've tried a couple of different medications, the latest being Amitriptyline HCL, but haven't had any luck.   Her anxiety  We've moved 3 times since we've had Chewy, which I think has contributed to her anxiety of being in a new place. However, we've been at our new house since July 2014 so I would hope that wouldn't be an issue now.  She also has a fascination with being under things. Coffee tables, end tables, chairs, our bed, anything she can fit under, she'd rather be under it. She sleeps under our bed every night, and is under our coffee table in front of me as I type this. I've read this could have something to do with feeling protected.   I should also mention that she isn't shy at all. She has no issues with people or people coming over, etc.; she greets anyone and everyone pretty much immediately. That is why I am unsure about her feeling ""unprotected"" when she is always under something.  Allergies  I am not 100% sure that Chewy has allergies, but she might. When she was a puppy, our vet told us that she might have allergies and suggested we switch to a grain-free food. She's been on grain-free food ever since, although we aren't too particular when it comes to treats, etc., not having grains. She doesn't appear to have allergies to me (but I am not a vet and she hasn't been tested for allergies to my knowledge).  Bathing  I've also considered the fact that she might have dry skin, which could cause itching and thus her biting her arms. She honestly isn't bathed very often. She's an indoor dog but we really only bathe her when she absolutely needs it (i.e. gets muddy outside). I'm wondering if she needs to be bathed more often, possibly with a shampoo that can moisturize her skin?  Here is what her arm looks like right now, you can see the baldness (this is her left arm), although it doesn't look that bad right now:    Has anyone ever seen or heard of a dog doing this before or have any ideas/suggestions that we could try to get her to stop? "
1232,Is toy destruction a sign that my dog needs more exercise?,"Short Story  Is my dog doing ok? He destroys toys, but not other stuff (yet). He gets 2 walks a day, each is 2 miles and 1 hour in duration. He is alone and sleeps during the day (9 hours) He's 2 years old.  Mostly it's the toy destruction that has me wondering: is he getting enough exercise or is it just his personality? He LOVES chewing his toys. I'm fine with getting more expensive/durable toys, but I don't want to mask an underlying exercise need that isn't being met.  Long Story  I adopted a 2 year old American Staffordshire Terrier / Boxer mix a week ago. I take him for a 2 mile / hour long walk morning and evening before meals.  He's alone for 9-10 hours per day while I'm at work. I leave the radio on, have a video chat  with him at lunch, and give him a Kong with wet food for entertainment. I do not have a backyard.  He cries for 2-5 minutes after I leave, then he sleeps all day. He usually grabs 1 or 2 things he's not supposed to during the day. He doesn't destroy them or heavily chew them, just leaves them strewn about my apartment. He does destroy his toys however.  I'm hoping to eventually play fetch with him in the morning for 30 minutes, but I'm waiting until I have a better idea how he is around other dogs. He'll always have a muzzle if there are other dogs and I'll try long line training first. "
1233,Is it a bad idea to make different-sized dogs sleep in different rooms?,"As we are getting further into winter, the temperature gradient in my house (at night) has increased: the conservatory is cold, the kitchen is room-temperature, and the living room is warm (there are lots of radiators in there).  Now, I have three dogs: a small Cavachon with thin fur, a medium-sized Labernese with quite thick fur, and a huge Bernese mountain dog with very thick fur.  Is it a good idea to make these dogs sleep in different rooms (the Cavachon in the living room, the Labernese in the kitchen, and the Bernese in the conservatory), so that they are at their most comfortable temperature, or is it better to make them all sleep in the same room (making at least two of them uncomfortable)? Will making them sleep in different rooms ""separate the pack"" and create tension between them, or will they understand that they are being separated because they have different physical needs? "

1235,"Strategy for taking in two very young, non-socialized stray cats","Two very young cats (siblings) moved into my yard and the surrounding properties. They first appeared when they were about 3-4 months old(?) and they're probably 5-6 months old now. I would like to take them in. They appear healthy and active; unfortunately, they do not appear to be socialized &mdash; at least they will not let me near them (yet). I don't know if their parents were feral, but I know kittens born to feral cats can be socialized at an early age.   I started feeding them about a week ago. They still run off when I go outside, but they're returning within minutes now that I leave them food on a regular basis. I put their bowls near a large sliding glass door leading into our living room, so they're becoming more accustomed to seeing me moving about the house. They're starting to sit near the door in the evening waiting for dinner, but when I approach the door, they run off.  How should I proceed? Are there any techniques to help them get used to me and (hopefully) more socialized? Is there anything else I can do?  We've become quite fond of them, and I want to give them every chance.     Update, one of the cats cautiously approached me as I was setting out their food today. I held my hand out and she rubbed on it and eventually let me pet her a bit. She was a bit apprehensive but I sat calm and quiet and she started to purr and vocalize a bit. The other cat is still much more skittish. "
1236,Why did my cat poop in my bag?,I just got an 8 month old cat at the shelter about a week ago. Right from the beginning he has always used the litter box without fail. BUT tonight he decided to go into my duffle bag that was on the floor and poop in it! Why did he do this? Is this likely to become a habit? And what do I do to keep it from becoming a habit?  Added from comment: The litter box was clean and I know he was not feeling afraid to go to his litter box because it is by his food and water bowl and he went in there to eat right before. 
1237,Why do my cats get cuddly in these rooms only?,"My cats are almost one year old and I ve had them for around 8-9 months. I've been noticing for a good month now, that both of them enjoy cuddling in the toilet and bathroom. Yes, toilet room is separate and on the opposite end of the corridor to the bathroom.   I will be quite blunt here - When I go to toilet to do my stuff, my cats always imply on me opening the door, only to get inside and go around my legs and jump on my lap. They look more joyous than they normally do. They jump towards my hand for a cuddle, they lick my fingers, bite them playfully etc. I thought that it was something to do with the door being closed - as I read many other questions, cats 'panic' when the doors are closed anywhere! - but turns out it makes no difference. I went once without closing the door and the same thing happened.   Then at some point the same thing kept happening in the bathroom, whenever for example I was brushing my teeth, washing hands, or anything else. They'd go around my legs and do everything mentioned previously.   They don't ever do that in any other rooms. They'd obviously stick their head out for some head scratching but that lasts for a few seconds. In the toilet room and bathroom it can last for half an hour.  Is there anything weird about this? Or is this something completely okay?  "
1238,How to I train my dog to stop digging on the sofa?,"My dog digs. It's not to sharpen his claws. He is anxious. The older dad dog was fine for 1 yr, in his new home with me but then he decided to dig and destroy my entire sofa. He looked guilty and I saw him so I know he did this. I want to buy a new sofa, how do I ease his need to dig my sofa? He has toys and 2 beds. Is there an anti anxiety medication that would work??   "
1239,Is my cat pulling its fur out due to a lack of teeth?,"My cat has begun to pull his fur out while grooming. At first, I thought it might be an allergic reaction, as was indicated by a Google search, but I have since dismissed that theory. My cat is not overgrooming, he's just grooming normally (I also removed several things that might be causing an allergic reaction: room fresheners and diet change - no change). My cat is indoor only.   What I have noticed is that my cat no longer 'chews' when grooming. This behavior has been replaced by pulling the fur out wholesale. I have three cats, and while grooming they all pause and seem to 'nibble' or 'chew' on a certain area for a moment, before moving on. I've always assumed this is normal behavior. My cat now no longer does this, and is instead pulling his fur out.   Question: Why is my cat doing this? Is there something I can do to prevent it?   Important Factors:    I noticed this change shortly after my cat had dental surgery. He had a lot of teeth removed, including almost all of his molars, and one lower incisor. Aside from the incisor, his front teeth remain intact. I'm beginning to wonder if this lack of teeth is causing my cat to pull his fur out, though I'm not sure why it would.  I no longer let my cat eat dry food, due to the surgery mentioned above. He wants to eat it, but cannot chew it. This results in him swallowing it whole, where it sits in a lump in his stomach and slowly expands with the moisture (the food is very hard and dry). I let my cat have small amounts of dry food on occasion, but otherwise feed him only canned wet food (which he eats fine cut up).    Let me know if you need more information, and thanks for your time!  "
1240,Associating vocal command with behavior during clicker training (cats),"I've been clicker training my youngest cat (Romeo, 3-4 years old, male, neutered). He associated the clicker with a treat, and now we're working on ""down"" (as in, jump off the counter you troublemaker).  He knows that during a training session (we work in the bedroom away from the other cats) that if he jumps off the bed he gets a click and treat. So he'll jump up and down off the bed repeatedly (without the voice command) and then make frustrated noises at me for not rewarding him. Once he's done that a few times, and sits down, I'll give him the ""down"" command (a few times) and when he jumps down I reward him.  Am I responding to him in the right way (and he just needs more repetition to associate the voice command with the behavior?), or should I be doing something else. I don't like to see him get so frustrated at not getting the reward, but I've never done clicker training before. Is the frustration part of the process? "
1241,Why is my cat afraid of the clicker sound?,"My oldest cat (Ginger, 12 years old, female, spayed) is very food motivated so I thought she would take to clicker training. She flinches away from the sound of the clicker and after about 3-4 treats she ignores me (and the food!) altogether.  Should I just keep trying to associate the clicker with the food (2-3 treats at a time)? Is there something else I should do besides just click/treat? Or will she never become accustomed to the clicker? "
1242,"Cat moving between legs, with tail straight up","I am trying to understand the behaviour of a stray cat which daily comes outside our gate and meows. My friend and I give her milk. She then drinks it and starts moving in between our legs with tail vertically up straight. When I tries to move back, she comes toward me. When I try to touch her, she starts looking at my hand. Although she is very small, I am afraid of her nails. But when she is drinking milk, I can touch her on head, until she is drinking. I really want to pick her up :3  My question is: what is the cat's behaviour mean? Is she getting friendly and wants attention or want me not to touch her? "
1243,Is there any conclusive evidence of what the cause of Alabama Rot is?,"There's been an outbreak of Alabama Rot in a dog near to my house. This raised concerns for my pets. I tried to find some information on what causes it and what preventative measures to take but much of the information online seems vague and contradictory.   Can anyone provide some solid information on the latest thinking around this disease? Its causes, effective preventative measures, etc? "
1244,Cat Suddenly Afraid of Dog,"I have a four-year-old ragdoll cat and a one-year-old miniature schnauzer puppy (about half the cat's size). The cat has learned to tolerate the dog and only retreats to high ground if she is actively being pestered. Neither animal has even been aggressive toward the other.  I recently took the cat outside to explore the backyard and enjoy the warm weather. This trip happened to be her first time in the yard since getting the dog. When she returned inside, she was immediately very skittish around the dog, seeking a hiding spot if she even heard the dog in another room.  The backyard is where the dog habitually releases waste, so I'm sure it must smell very much like her to other animals. Did I inadvertently create a dominance issue by introducing the cat into the dog's ""territory""? If so, is there anything I can do to reset the scales? It's been a couple days since this started, and the cat is showing great improvement on her own, but I wonder if there's anything else I can do to help besides wait. "
1245,Golden Retriever puppy after vaccination,"My Golden Retriever breed puppy is 75 days old. Yesterday, he got his 2nd vaccination. However, after almost 36 hours, he behaves something different such as biting everything, peeing elsewhere, not listening our voice, and irregularity in pooping, sleeping in corner of the room. Is it normal for him? or need any urgent attention? "
1246,What determines a cat's hunting preferences?,"Over the years, I've had a number of cats, and I've noticed that they all have their own preferences for how they prefer their toys to behave.  Some of them wanted their toys dragged on the ground, some of them were only interested if they were fluttering in the air, and our current cat doesn't care, so long as she can pounce on it from hiding.  I've always presumed that this corresponds to different hunting behavior in wild cats - a preference for catching small ground critters, birds, or whatever they can sneak up on.  Now I'm wondering what determines this preference.  Is it genetic?  Taught?  Or just subject to each cat's individual preferences?  Or is it simply me reading too much into how indoor cats play with human-powered toys? "
1247,When do we need cat nets on window?,Sometimes I see windows with a cat net installed on it.  How are they used? When should I consider using a cat net?  
1248,Why do dog/cat ears twitch when air passes over them?,"While I was in bed last night with my Pitbull, she had her head up near my face.  My nose was simply exhaling air near her ear, which caused it to repeatedly twitch.  If I exhaled more air, it would keep twitching, to the point where she would move her head.  I've noticed this back when I used to live with cats as well.  The same thing would occur with them.  Why do dog/cat ears twitch when air passed over them?  Do they have some sort of reflect or are they just more sensitive?  I will say that when I am exhaling at a normal rate, the air flow isn't that fast.  I can understand that it may be more annoying when I purposely exhale faster.   "
1249,Are sinking shrimp pellets healthy for Bettas?,"I like to give my fish a variety of foods, as it has been proven that the wider the variety, the healthier the fish. I have a lone Betta in a 5gal aquarium. I feed him floating betta pellets, and once a week I peel and defrost a pea, that he munches on. He gets freeze dried bloodworms occasionally and I sometimes crumble up freeze dried shrimp, that he gobbles up as well.  I notice that sometimes his floating Betta pellets will sink to the bottom, and he ALWAYS follows it down and eats it off the bottom. I know shrimp is safe for them to eat, but what about sinking shrimp pellets? They have additional ingredients besides just shrimp, so I wonder if it's safe to break them up smaller and supplement this into his diet as well? I use the pellets for my corydoras in my other tanks. Maybe he's getting enough variety, and it's not worth the risk? Or is it fine, and there is no risk? If it's not good for him, are there any other suggestions besides what I have listed for giving him variety? Thanks. "

1251,Will 2 cats keep each other stimulated?,"My girlfriend and I are waiting for 2 kittens to reach the 12 week mark so we can bring them home (since they are siblings they should get along, right?). We have both had cats as children and love them, so we finally decided to adopt our own.  While we're both going to be spending time playing with them, in the case we're both out of the appartment for anything between a few hours to maybe a day (they will of course have food and water!), will they keep each other stimulated or will they get bored easily?  One of the primary motivations for getting 2 is that they will keep each other company so they will refrain from destructive behavior in case we might not be around, is this true or just speculation?  So to boil it down to a concrete question: will getting 2 cats reduce boredom and keep them stimulated in case we're not around to play with them?    I'm working from home so I'll be around a lot, but a few times a year I'm out of the country for a few weeks for work reasons. Our parents have already told us they will look after the cats in case we're both gone for longer periods of time. "
1252,Bearded dragon sick or gravid?,"I have had my bearded dragon for almost a year, and I got her when she was a baby. She has always been very nice and never seemed agitated toward anyone. About a week ago I thought she had infertile eggs. She just got out of brumation. But she seems to be acting funny lately.  She has all the symptoms of having infertile eggs. She has been eating more, runs around her cage, and she has started to dig. I made a box for her to lay her eggs in but doesn't seem interested. Now when I go to pick her up she doesn't seem to want to come out of her cage. Now whenever I pet between her eyes she will kick me with her back legs!  She looks white like she's going to shed, but she has still never been this way with me before. Also when I can manage to get her out of her cage without a fuss she will randomly bolt away like under beds or just away from me. I'm worried about her. And I just want to make sure she's okay. She seems to be Always hungry. I haven't changed anything lately.  Could she just be stressed? Is she getting aggressive because of the eggs or is she sick and doesn't have eggs at all?  "
1253,Will my fish's tailfin grow back?,"I rescued a male guppy from an acquaintance's overcrowded tank. He had a 10 gallon with a female betta, x2 4inch silver dollars, x2 angelfish, and x8 assorted fancy guppies. This poor guppy was being chased and chewed on by the silver dollars, and betta, and was much skinnier than the rest. His tailfin has been mangled. I put him in his own micro tank (2.5g) for now BC it's the only extra I had available. I'm hoping he'll be able to eat better (the fish were literally rubbing up against each other and fighting for surface space at feeding time). After three days he's finally come out from hiding behind the plant and will come out and about and to the top when I feed him!   I'm hoping eventually I can move him to my larger community tank where he can be with other males and females but I don't know if his fin will ever heal properly and if he'd even have a good chance if it doesn't heal.  Right now he doesn't swim that well..He holds his body at a strange angle like he doesn't have enough fin or strength to hold up the back half of his body and drifts to the bottom and fights to make it back up... My questions are   Do fish fins grow back after they've been chewed and nipped on? and Are there any recommendations on anything else I can do for him? I've given him an extra dose of FW aquarium salt.   By the way, with a little nudging he got a second larger tank and separated the fish.... Just added pics, sorry for the poor quality.      "
1254,How to deal with accidental overdose of antibiotics on a cat?,"Last week I rescued a badly injured cat from the streets and have been since taking care of him. He's not playful or aggressive or have any cat-like attitude in him at all, which was worrying me. But today when I ran out of his antibiotic pill and had to buy more I discovered that the lady who sold me the antibiotics for the first time gave me wrong dosage.   We were supposed to give him one and a half pill of 75mg (totalling about 110mg) but instead we were giving him 450mg! I can't get in touch with the vet who was seeing him because she's traveling and his consult is only in four days, but I'm really worried about him. But if I go to another vet I'll have to pay another consult and I already spent tons of money on medicine and procedures to clean the infected wound (to have an idea, the muscle is exposed, he was being eaten alive by larvae).   But how worried should I be about this? Do I suspend the antibiotics completely? Do I take him right away to see a vet? Or should I wait four days?   By the way he's eating and drinking water properly and using the litter box, although his feces is VERY soft.  "
1255,Do the skin scales developing on my dead kitten provide any clues to what may have caused its death?,"Main details:  An orphaned kitten in my care recently passed away.  Early on, it was what I've seen described as one of those ""fading kittens"" --  crying all the time, glassy/watery eyes.  I've read that even under the best circumstances the lives of such kittens are rather fragile.  Admittedly, I made some mistakes along the way due to ignorance and would give anything to turn back the clock and do at least a couple of things differently, but unfortunately that is not an option.  Still, I'd like to know what might have caused its death and can't afford a necropsy.  Does anyone know of someone who does pro bono necropsies?  Please offer your recommendations if you do.  In the meantime, I am wondering if the following development isn't some sort of clue to what might have caused the kitten's demise.  The kitten must have died between 3 and 6 a.m. on the 26th of May.  It has now been more than 48 hours since its death (yes, we need to bury it soon).  Its belly is now very round and bloated. Does this reveal anything about what may have caused it to die? It also has developed small tear-drop shaped darkish skin scales on the right side of its abdomen (and also one long thin oval at the bottom of its belly. The skin scales are dark gray in color.  Does this also reveal anything about its condition or what caused it to die?  Additional information you may find helpful:  We think the kitten (a mackerel tabby with brown striping), might have been born prematurely because it was pretty small when I first found it.  I had no idea what to do with it at first, but I eventually put it in a cage with another cat we have who had a litter of seven healthy kittens about a month prior to my finding this orphaned kitten.  (The orphaned kitten is from a different mother.)  Though the mother of seven didn't seem crazy about adding an eighth kitten to the mix, she wasn't opposed to it either, so I thought it would all work out.  A day or two later, however, during a routine check on these kittens, I found one of the older kittens sitting on the orphaned kitten's head (I think it was trying to quiet it) and the orphaned kitten had (for lack of a better way of expressing it) pooped itself with a somewhat sizeable yellowish/brown stool that was somewhat watery, but firm.  At that point, I decided to take the orphaned kitten out of that environment, but then I didn't know what to feed it and I made the mistake of giving it some cow's milk (whole milk and organic). That was a huge mistake. Not long after that, it had a bout of vomiting and diarrhea. That's when I finally decided to go online and do a bit of research (discovering that cow's milk is a big no no) and found a goat's milk formula to use (which called for goat's milk, yogurt (I also used goat's milk yogurt), water, and egg yolk. The orphaned kitten did not expel for quite some time after that, but then when it did, its stools looked really healthy -- brown, firm, fully formed. I was really happy about this development, but then, all of a sudden, the orphaned kitten had two bowel movements on one day (the 21st). This time, however, the stools were fully formed and solid, but very light colored, yellowish, and were expelled with a bit of water.  I thought maybe I was heating the formula up too much, so I pulled back on that a bit and subsequent stools were still light yellow (kind of a mustard color), sometimes hard, large and fully formed and at other times, soft, but I stopped seeing watery, loose bowel movements.  Another detail of importance is the kitten's temperature.  In the beginning, this orphaned kitten was often cold when I picked it up, but in the days leading up to its death, it seemed to occasionally be holding on to some sort of body temperature of its own.  When I saw that the bowel movements were returning to normal and some type of evidence that it was beginning to maintain some sort of body temperature, I had thought it had made it through the danger zone, especially since it seemed to be crying a lot less and appeared to be doing some sort of imprinting -- long steady gazes into the faces of those who held it.  To find it dead was a complete shock to say the least.    I've gone online and tried to research this and I've seen posts that indicate it might be some sort of problem related to an underdeveloped intestinal tract, any number of diseases kittens may contract, and even a heart problem.  Nothing, thus far, however, has been all that conclusive.  Furthermore, my search for skin scales on dead kittens is proving to be pretty futile, but I can't help but wonder if this is an important detail that might narrow it down a bit.  I've attached some photos to help you help me make sense of this little kitten's death.  It won't bring it back to life, but any insight you can lend might bring me (and perhaps others in a similar predicament) a little bit of closure.

1256,Stress relief of parakeets? Is vegetable glycerine safe for parakeets/ small birds?,"I just brought home a baby parakeet. I know the typical recommendation for having a parakeet is either provide it with enough attention that it accepts you as it's flock or give it a buddy. My intention is to keep him as a lone parakeet, that attaches to me  vs another bird in its cage. I know this process may take some time for him to warm up to me but until he trusts me I know he will be a little stressed (he's a baby so he will adapt But he was caged with 8 other parakeets and is now alone).   I have read that rescue remedy flower essences for pets is ""safe"" for birds because it's base is vegetable glycerin instead of alcohol but it comes in a dropper bottle and I can't find info on how much to give him. I could see giving one or two drops in a larger parrots water being of little concern but I wonder about the dosage and safeness for a tiny bird like my budgie.   What's the dosage? Does anyone know if vegetable glycerin could cause diarrhea? Or has anyone used this on birds before? If so, how much did you give? By mouth or in water dish? Does anyone have any other tips on what would be a good stress relieving supplement instead? I just want to make him as comfortable as possible, I'm much more used to larger birds, and know budgies have sensitive bodies and that stress can literally kill them.  Background, behavior and Environment Info: he's between 2-3 months old. His cage is placed in view of my cockatiel, but not within reach of each other. The room he's in has the most amount of activity so he's never in dead space. He's already stepping up onto my finger, and will hang onto my shirt, but doesn't hang out for more than 5minutes before getting wiggly, as of yet. He has plenty of toys and perches, and he has ample water and seed (the same kind he was on at the pet store until I've had him long enough to switch). A spray of millet is available. I cover him at night. He's strictly indoors. He didn't eat food for the first day except a little millet, but is eating now. It's day 3. He had what I'd assume was stress induced diarrhea for the first 24hrs, I assume stress because it went away after he started eating again. He was not hand fed or hand raised and has no ankle band. The store he came from does not allow customer interaction with them which is good for stress and contamination while there, but not so good for human socialization or hand recognition. He made little chirping sounds at the pet store but hasn't made a sound until tonight... After covering him it sounded like he was purring himself to sleep.  Active Ingredients: HPUS 5x dilution of Helianthemum, Hummularium, Clematis Vitalba, Impatiens glandulifera, Primus cerasifera, Ornithogalum umbellatum. Inactive Ingredients: 80%Glycerin 20%water. The active ingredients are the Latin names for the different flower essences. "
1257,Will Pea Gravel keep cats from using my garden as a potty?,"I am planning on using small rocks in a section of garden and I want to pick the smallest size/shape that will keep cats from using it as a toilet.   At first I was considering sand, but that seems to be an invitation for cats to use as a litter box area  I have a neighbor with 2 inch (5cm) river rock in his garden area and cats don't bother it at all. But is is kind of a pain to work with and around.   I want to pick the smallest size that will prevent neighborhood cats from using it as a toilet. I am guessing someplace between sand and 2 inch (5cm) river rock should work.    Pea Gravel is readily available and easy to work with, but will it be large enough to keep cats from using it? if not what is the smallest effect deterrent?

I have small tables at each head corner of my bed, holding various things on shelves at different levels, including a telephone, my alarm clock, tissues, a mini first-aid kit, books I am reading before bed, and each has a small lamp on the top.  These lamps are just over a foot tall, and maybe 8 or 9 inches diameter on the shades (about 35-40cm tall, 20-25cm dia).  As she has become more comfortable in her new home and with me as her human, she has taken on a new hobby.  The cat has been rubbing against the shades of these lamps while I am sleeping, and frequently rubbing hard enough to tip it over onto the floor.  Fortunately in this age of plastic LED bulbs, there is really no harm done, though the shades might be getting lightly wrinkled.  The biggest problem here is the sudden jolting awake this causes for me.  Unfortunately, this means I am not really able to issue a proper corrective action.  I have noticed this happens mostly in the hour before wake-up time- 0545 for me, but it has happened as early as 0200.  I wonder if it might be a deliberate attempt to get me up for breakfast, although it doesn't work, I just put the lamp back and go back to sleep.  I considered spraying the lamps with a citrus oil, as I have used this successfully in other places.  But I find that I do not like that smell either, and these lamps are very near my nose while sleeping.  I also considered trying some sort of adhesive on the bottom of the lamp, but I am not sure what kind would work well, yet still allow adjusting or shifting the lamp when desired.  Has anyone had a similar situation, and any other suggestions of things to try?  Updates/ Response to some suggestions:   Screws.  This would be an absolute desperate last resort in my mind.  These lamps and tables have value as aesthetic as well as practical objects, and I can't justify ruining that. Kick the cat out.  Cat has her own bed in the bedroom, and prefers to sleep there.  I have rarely rolled over to find her against my leg or around my feet. Far more often if I wake up at night, she is in her own bed.  As mentioned, this cat is still relatively new to me, so this may change as we become better friends, and if so, I will enjoy it.  I also prefer the air flow with the door open- it gets stuffy when closed. Inverted spike-y mats.  Although others swear it works, in my experience, this is a myth.  My prior cat genuinely enjoyed lying on the stuff.  Current cat totally ignores it.  Plus, the tables are small enough and close enough to the bed to keep the lamps in scent-rubbing reach even with rear paws on the bed, and fore paws just on the edge of the table. Command brand picture hanging strips.  This was an excellent suggestion and I had some left over from, what else, hanging pictures.  I put two pieces on the base of each lamp yesterday evening, and this morning at 0509 I hear ""rip -  clunk - crash.""  Careful examination in the morning revealed the flaw- the strips have thickness, raising the lamp up by a few millimeters.  Plus, these strips have a lot of ""play"" in them side-to-side.  So when pushed in the direction opposite the axis of how I placed the strips, actually produced a levering effect making it easier to tip over.  I am going to add a third strip perpendicular to the other two and try again.  Fingers crossed. Replace the lamps with head-board mounted kinds.  I will do some shopping and see what I can come up with.  My headboard is of the upholstered style, and rather thick.  There are some boards along the back side I might be able to get a screw into if I pull the bed out.  I'm not confident I can find anything, but I will look.   Going Further:   Why?  Is the cat just scent marking, or is she trying to wake me up either for breakfast or simple attention?  So far, she has only done this at night, or at least, I have never observed her rubbing the lamps except at night.  And so far, only once in the middle of the night, and far more often in the hour before scheduled alarm clock time.  I really can't say for sure.  Deliberate wake-up attempt is of course a valid hypothesis, but I doubt we could ever prove it.  I think it best to begin by assuming (for now) it is simple marking behavior, and the tipping is accidental.  "
1265,My dog has been acting strangely around one of my cats' butt,"Our family has a dog and four cats.  The dog's name is Brutus, he's male, 6 years old and a Boston Terrier/Beagle mix.  The cat relevant to this question is named Smudge; he's a male gray tabby cat, and is about a year and a half old.  Over the past week, Brutus has been unusually interested in Smudge:   Brutus has been whining more frequently, but only when Smudge is near him. Brutus has been chasing Smudge around more.   In response, Smudge usually jumps somewhere that Brutus can't physically reach (e.g. atop furniture, or behind a futon).  Brutus has been sniffing Smudge's ass more, and trying to hump him more frequently.   Facts that may be relevant:   We let Brutus roam around our backyard, but we also walk him daily.  No formal limits on how long he's out there, but it's rarely more than half an hour at a time. All of our cats are indoor cats, and none have gotten out recently. Brutus has tried to hump the cats before, but not to the extent I'm describing now. All animals have been eating without any problems. All animals have been relieving themselves without any problems.   This means that there have been no accidents, and there is nothing unusual about anyone's poop or urine.  All pets are friendly towards each other, and play or cuddle regularly.   This means that none of our pets have been violent or confrontational; there has been no scratching, hissing, barking, growling, or biting of any kind.  We recently had Brutus vaccinated for rabies.  He's got a clean bill of health. Brutus is not fixed, but all four cats are. Brutus has never humped people or objects, to my knowledge.   Here's my question: Are my pets okay?  Might one of them have a disease?  Should I bring any of them to the vet? "
1266,Why does my parakeet try to bite me?,"My parakeet is not afraid of me, he sits on the palm of my hand and eats food. Sometimes he even refuses to get down. However he bites me when I move my finger towards him while he is eating (sitting on my palm), he tries to bite and rip off the skin (but it doesn't really hurt much).   Does this mean he is trying to dominate me? Or is it something else? "
1267,could my cat catch something from this oddly-acting mouse?,"So this all started at one A.M., when I usually go down to get a cat to lay with me in bed. When I opened the door to let them in, I noticed that our oldest kitty had something in his mouth, so I went to investigate.  It was a mouse. A living, squeaking mouse.  The second the cat saw me look at the thing, he dropped it, and I managed to get a basket over it before my other cats could kill the poor thing. I put him outside and, after a moment, he started to move! I was really happy, but I noticed some odd behaviour, and I want to make sure that my kitty isn't in any danger.  At first, he fidgeted a bit, clearly coming out of shock, and then began to wash the saliva off of himself. As he got up to move, I noticed that he was moving in lazy circles. Not constantly, only three or four times, and he'd stop to groom himself or have a sniff at something, so I'm wondering if he was cleaning his tail? Then again, I've also seen that rabies or plasmodium symptoms could cause circling. Or perhaps the shock of it all?  As I'm writing this, it's about ten minutes since I saw him circling, and he's no longer in sight of my window. What do you guys think? Should I be worried?  EDIT: My apologies, it appears my question wasn't clear. The question here is: Should I be worried about my cat catching something from the mouse? "
1268,Why did my mother cat suddenly attack me?,"My nice and well behaved Siamese delivered her first litter 6 weeks ago. We had a very strong bond, she would sleep with me and I was her favorite human. She trusted me enough to go in labor lying on me which tells a lot about our relationship. First month after the labor everything was perfect, she was bringing me kittens or she would leave me with them alone while she takes a nap somewhere quiet. I didn't touch them too much, but they all loved sleeping on me together with mamma. 2 weeks ago when they were all sleeping behind me I turned around to check on them and mamma cat suddenly jumped on my face and started attacking me viciously. She would not stop, I barely escaped and closed myself in a room. I got some pretty serious injuries all over my body.  I called for help and we managed to lock her up. She wouldn't let me near her next two days and I somehow managed to get her food inside. Now she seems to be fine when the kittens are not around, she even comes for pets and sleeps on my lap, but when kittens come near me she gets upset and attacks the same way if I make any suspicious moves. The biggest problem is that kittens are very active now and it's hard to keep them in one room. I thought things would get better now that they're bigger, but it only gets worse. Will my cat trust me again? How will she react when kittens leave in 2 weeks? "
1269,"rats not getting along,rats too young?","Im a new rat owner, and Iv'e gotten three rats at the moment. As a new rat owner I made the mistake of not getting my first rat in a pair or group and I got the largest one at the pet store. His name is Walter and he was put as the ""Jumbo rat."" He had healing or healed bite marks and bruises on his tail. I had him for a few days then got all this information about rats needing to be in pairs or groups because of how social they are.   So I got two new ""medium rats."" Victor and Charles (I've had the babies for five days now). I have a large tank and a carrier at the moment but no barred cages because of money issues. I've been putting the rats in neutral areas and they've been great together. I put them in the carrier for awhile and they did well in there, not fighting but just sniffing and sleeping beside each other.   But, whenever I have them all in the tank it all just goes down. Victor and Walter seem to be the ones fighting for dominance and Charles is the calm one that always gets brought into it. Victor squeaks quite loudly at Walter, I'm not sure if its because of how he's scared of the larger rat or its a dominance thing? And it seems to stress Walter out or irritate him then a fight happens. I break it up, though. I'm not sure if I should let it go until it gets bad. But I think its all because I'm introducing them wrong?  I have put the carrier in the tank, so they know each other's smells. I put the lid on at night and when I'm out then when I'm at home I take it off and watch them. As soon as Victor or Charles step out of the carrier a fight happens. I've been checking the two for any wounds and they have scratches and bites on them. Charles even has a small bite wound on his head which worries me terribly. I don't know what I should do and it's all been putting me in a terrible mental state.  How can I introduce my 3 rats to each other so they won't fight each other?   "
1270,Is it okay for an elderly cat to be sleeping in the litterbox?,"Our eldest cat is 18 1/2 and is healthy for his age. He still runs, loves attention, goes out for 'constitutionals' (short walks round the neighborhood) and generally appears to thrive.  He has lost a little weight but we think that that is normal for his age. He still has a very healthy appetite, and makes sure we know it is feeding time. He is a little stiff, but stairs and laps are no problem.  But as of late, he has taken to sleeping in the litter tray. We have two of them (we have multiple cats, all with access to the outdoors), but he has picked one tray as a bed. The other cats don't use that tray much, and especially when the tray is clean, the old cat curls up on it and sleeps there. When we move him to another, comfortable place, more often than not he'll trot back to his tray again.  The tray is not in an especially warm place, so the behaviour has us puzzled a little. Is this something we should be worried about? What might cause him to prefer such a sleeping place? "
1271,How to use a spray bottle as negative reinforcement?,"I don't use a spray bottle in training our pets. I did use it in the 80's when I had the 2nd cat of my own, but it did not really work out so well. With the first cat I did not know about spray bottles being used for this, and later I've not seen a need to use one.  Now I hear a spray bottle is useful whenever my dogs or cats (we have both) behave badly, and for example to teach them not to get on couches and chairs. Well, our dogs don't go on couches and chairs anyway. I heard that the dog/cat should not see me spray it, but I should do it covertly from behind a corner or something. Why is that?  Is a spray bottle useful in training? What is the correct way to use it as a training aid? "
1272,Why does my cat's sneeze contain blood?,"One of our cats, from time to time, goes into fits of sneezing (almost machine gun-like) that is worrisome, but there is also sometimes blood in the discharge. She's eating and drinking fine and her behavior is unchanged from normal, so beyond the sneezing and discharge, she appears fine and content.   What would be the cause or concerns with this? Online info indicates that it's not really the big a deal if she's eating and drinking normally. If that's true, what can I do to make it easier for her? "
1273,What types of food and vitamins are appropriate for a leopard gecko?,"My partner and I have had many reptiles over the years (bearded dragons, snakes of various sizes etc) but our latest additions are 2 leopard geckos - we're not sure exactly what breed, but we think the younger female is a hypo, if that means anything to anyone?  They live in the same vivarium and are very friendly with each other, but we separate them when we cannot supervise them as we think him trying to mount her while still so young would stress her out unduly.   What vitamins should we be adding to their food, and is there anything in particular we should be feeding them? They currently eat morio worms, small (4ths) locusts and the occasional wax worm. The locusts and morio worms are popular, but neither of the geckos appear too keen on the wax worms. Should we be putting vegetation for them to graze on as well? "
1274,What mammals that are commonly kept as pets can be kept healthy on a vegan diet?,"We know from Can I feed my cat a vegetarian or vegan diet? that trying to force a vegan diet on some types of pets might not be healthy.    If someone is looking for pet, with a preference for a mammal that can be housebroken, with a naturally vegan diet (herbivorous), what common animals would they want to consider?  "
1275,"5-month puppy first day at home: guarding couch, growling, biting","Apologies for the long post in advance!  After our beloved Dobermann passed away some time ago, we decided to get a new dog. We picked a cute 5-month mixed race puppy from a local shelter. In the shelter she looked lovely: active, curious, loving of human interaction, very good relationship with the rest of dogs, etc. She did look like the perfect dog for us.  Today we picked her up from the shelter and took her home. She was great, very excited all the way, and very loving. But after 30 minutes of snooping around the house, she jumped on the couch.  I thought 'here we go', and simply picked her up and put her down on the floor, saying 'Off'. Same thing we did with our previous dog when she was a puppy, and it wasn't a big deal. It just takes some repetition and conviction.  So down she went to the floor, and 5 minutes later she jumped again. So i picked her up again, and then she growled a bit. I thought 'wow, this one's bold'. After 3 or 4 more attempts, the growling started to become serious. I remained calm and kept putting her down on the floor, saying 'Off'. A little bit later, I was in the kitchen when I heard my wife yell at the dog. The dog had snapped at her and she was quite upset and afraid to pick her up. So I grabbed the dog again, she growled very menacingly and tried to bite me too.  The situation got worse progressively. After 3 or 4 more attempts, the puppy would growl at us just by getting anywhere near the sofa. I knew we had to stand our ground, or else she would just be reinforced in her behaviour. So I tried sitting in the couch as close as possible so that she wouldn't growl, then slowly inch towards her, trying to 'claim' the space back by spreading my legs, square shoulders, and so on. When I was close enough I just picked her up again and tried to put her on the floor and then she bit me in the arm. The teeth didn't get past the thick sweater I was wearing but it was a bite nonetheless.  After some hesitation, I was determined to take the dog away from the couch. So I wrapped my arm with a thick blanket and picked her up and put her down again, and she tried to bite me, a lot. After she was on the floor we took her out to the garden and waited til she was calm, then i put her on leash and let her free again.  Now we're just sitting on the couch and every time she jumps on the couch, I just pull the leash and put her down. Oddly enough, this does not seem to upset her and she goes back to her dog bed after that. She's now sleeping in her bed looking all cute and innocent, waiting for the next opening... This has been going on for about 1 hour now and I'm writing during this break in the hostilities to ask you people, how weird is this?  I've been reading online and this seems to be a common problem with dogs, but it seems to happen with people who start by letting the dogs on the furniture, and then the dogs become possessive/dominant over time and etc. This also usually happens with teenage dogs, not puppies.   This dog has been with us for a total of 6 hours, and I know for a fact she's never ever seen a couch before in her life, since she was abandoned when she was days old and left at the shelter together with her brothers. She hasn't been abused or had any incidents that might explain this.  It's also strange that she seems to click out of this behaviour as soon as she touches the floor. 5 minutes after biting me, she was all sweet and licking my hand and following me around the house like nothing ever happened.  Do you think this is just her testing the waters and trying to find her place, and will go away soon? Or is it an indication of some kind of problem? We plan to have children soon and I'm not having an unstable / nippy dog around the house when that happens.  UPDATE: as per suggestions in comments, we tried putting some unwashed clothes on the dog bed. This seemed to work for a while. After an uneventful night, we are now more or less back to the situation of yesterday, minus the biting because we use the leash to pull her off the couch, but the growling continues. We will now seek advice from an ethologist to try to find a solution for this. In the meantime, any suggestions or thoughts are very welcome.  "
1276,Should a cat's nose be wet or dry?,"My cat's nose is usually very moist. However, today I found it to be very hot and dry. I've searched about that, but the Internet seems really divided about the subject; some says a dry nose means a sick cat and others that it's a wet nose...  So this makes me wonder, what's supposed to be normal for a healthy cat, a dry or moist nose? And is this even a good health indicator? "
1277,What effect does the number of littermates have on the appetite of a kitten?,"My ragdoll kitten is now 5 months old and it has developed a somewhat stout body. The healthy cat body figures I've found are showing an adult cat. By these figures my kitten is overweight, but as it is still a kitten I've not paid much attention - until recently.  This ragdoll kitten is one of six. In my mind I see him fighting for food when he was still living with his littermates. We received him at the age of 13 weeks. Now, I'm comparing this ragdoll to our two years old Maine coon, whom we received when she was 15 weeks old. The Maine coon was, and still is, quite a lean bodied kitten/cat. As far as I know she is one of three littermates and therefore would not have needed to fight for food.  Is it possible that the number of littermates has an effect on the kitten's appetite later in life? We have dry food on constant offer for our cats, and we serve wet food without a firm schedule two or three times a day. The ""largelitter"" ragdoll attacks wet food like he was starving to death, while the ""small-litter"" Maine coon stays away and goes to eat only after all our other cats have left the vicinity of food plate(s).  So, is this just coincidental to these kitten and cat that we have, or is it generally true? Additionally, should I pay attention to this when shaping our feeding policy and habits? "
1278,What kind of diet do Vietnamese Mossy Frogs need?,"I assume that, being frogs, they're insectivores, but what insects would be a good diet for them? Would a diet of only crickets be okay, or would I need to feed them other types of insects as well? "
1279,Would a sailfin dragon get along with a cat?,"I've read that Sailfin Dragons a quite receptive of human handling and can make pretty good pets. I'm curious if that means they would get along with other animals too.  I have two cats, and they're both well behaved around reptiles. They show some interest in the smaller lizards that scurry about suddenly, but other than that they ignore them (they're well aware they would be in huge trouble with me if they bothered any of the reptiles).  Still, I acknowledge that most reptiles see cats as predators, and there's a short period where it takes them to get used to their presence and realize that they're perfectly safe. What I'm curious about, is that since sailfin dragons get to be about a meter long, would they consider my cats to be predators at all? A meter is a little over 3 feet long and easily larger than both of my cats.  The reason I'm interested in them, is that they're supposed to be a more reasonable cousin of iguanas, but should I worry about them attacking my cats? How well would a sailfin dragon get along with a cat? "

1281,Will feeding other fish in the same pond have an impact on my koi in winter?,"There are two sturgeons in the pond which need to be fed during winter.  As far as I know koi don't need food during frost periods and only a small amount when the pond isn't frozen. I kept feeding the sturgeons on one spot of the pond, unfortunately that is the very same spot the koi choose to spend most of their time at now that it got cold.  Does the sturgeon activity have an impact on the well being of the koi? Should I feed the sturgeons at another spot, eg some meters away from the koi? "
1282,"What is ""crating"" a dog?","First; this is not to ask for a step-by-step training advice.  There are many questions and answers on Pets-SE that mention ""crating"" and ""crate-training"" a dog. First time I personally found crate-training was in this question:  Crate training our puppy is not working?  Having my doubts I went to Google it, to find ""How to Crate Train your dog or puppy."" which I read until this ""Never close the door until the dog is relaxed and comfortable."" came up. Of course I read the rest of the article too, but that quote is what made me ask this.  Okay, we had a crate for our dog too. The crate was there for the dog to go in to have a peaceful place to sleep and rest. Here's the difference, we never closed the door. At the moment we don't have any crate at home, except those disassembled ones in basement. I consider both of our dogs ""crate-trained"" so that they feel okay in a closed crate when we take them to a dog show. Maybe we are just lucky to have two such nice dogs that we can leave them home by themselves while the human members of our family are away at work and school.  So, the question. Why would I close the crate door at home? What is ""crating a dog"" really? What purpose has it, other than to offer a dog a safe place to sleep and rest? "
1283,Does my cat have eye worms?,"I managed to pull 5-6 strange elastic white-transparent organisms from Toby's eyes. I never witnessed them move.  They're definitely not hairs, and using 19x macro lens took some pictures of them improvising a home-made microscope.  Afterwards, I took him to the vet, where we managed to pull one more worm (?) from the eye and vet examined it using his microscope. He seemed confused and unsure. I am from Europe and the only parasite here that infests cats eyes is Thelazia callipaeda, so we assumed it should be it, although the vet admitted he couldn't identify body parts (morphology or whatever), and neither was moving. I also failed to find similarity between verified (cdc.gov) microscopic images of T. Callipaeda and my own kinda-microscopic images.  Anyway, we decided to move forward with Milbemax.  Can somebody please help confirm that this might be indeed T. Callipaeda, or at least if it is in fact a parasite by using the pictures I took?                "
1284,Is Cotton Wool an acceptable substitute for Hamster bedding?,"I've got two Roborovski Hamsters which both have good sized cages. I like to try and change their bedding frequently which obviously increases the cost of the bedding.  It seems there are two types of material required for a hamster:   Absorbent shavings to cover the ground Softer bedding to build a bed with   Buying in bulk seems to be alright for the shavings but less so for the softer stuff. In terms of price, a bag of cotton wool balls (with no additives) costs far less than the softer packs of bedding.   Is there a downside or issue with using cotton wool balls (or small pieces of a larger sheet of cotton wool) as a cheaper substitute for the hamsters?  Potential issues I could think of:   Perhaps cotton wool is less absorbent Maybe the fibres would get caught around their legs or something?     To clarify, I only want to replace the more expensive soft bedding not the shavings. "
1285,Letting the 2 cats fight? or keep them separate in separate closed rooms?,"My male cat got mature and was yowling whole day. We don't want to neuter him so we bought a female cat approx. the same age as him. Female seems to be calm after 2 days in her new house but our male cat has started running after her and she also runs away to save herself. Our male cat is the one starting the fight and is still yowling loudly all day. His sound pisses us off. What should be done so that they don't fight? How much time will they take to mate? They are my first pets, I don't know much about behavior of cats. Thanks. "
1286,"Is it possible to train a collared dove for ""rock climbing""?","Blue tits can do it: climbing and clinging on various structures, also upside-down, seems to be easy for this kind of birds.  [website]Also I have seen sparrows that could climb/cling (also upside-down) for a short moment on something. However, I have never seen that a collared dove ""rock climbed"" on something. Is this because a collared dove has more weight than a blue tit or have blue tits special forms of the feet?  Could it be possible that someone who owns a collared dove can train it to climb upside-down (rock climbers say sometimes ""climbing on a overhang or roof"")? "

The second time she molted she molded wrong and her front hands got stuck in skin so she can’t grab food. So I’ve been hand feeding her cat food (I read online that’s what you should hand feed them) until she molted again and was able to feed herself. However, she hasn’t molted again. She’s supposed to be a giant Asian mantis. and she’s tiny. I mist her everyday. And she lives in a huge habitat.

Well, recently Skeeter has been drinking her milk again, is this harmful in anyway? What should I do? "
1290,Male approaching female frequently!,We recently bought a female cat for our male cat. Female took 3 days to stop hissing whenever she sees the male cat. Male cat was trying to approach her since day one but today he got the chance to mate. I haven't seen him but I have been informed that after mating he is trying again and again to approach female for mating. He has already done it few times. They are my first pets so I dont know much about such behavior. What is the cause? Is this normal? This is his first mate. 
1291,Neighbor's cat coming back for kitten,"I've been looking around and haven't find someone in the same situation as I am, so I'm making my first question here.  About 1 1/2 month ago my neighbor's cat gave birth to 4 kittens in my basement. We don't know exactly when they were born, but we found them 5 1/2 weeks ago and 1 or 2 days later they opened their eyes. We took care of the mother, giving her food and water and after she started leaving the den we spent some time with her close to it.  This weekend the neighbor took 3 of the kittens to new homes and we had already decided to keep 1 of them the day we found them.  Since the mother was away from the den more often than not and the kitten stayed there alone, we took it inside the house on monday afternoon. The kitten spent the day under the bed (which I learned is common) and sometimes her mother came to the glass back door of the kitchen and started meowing. The kitten was too afraid to leave my room and meowed back from my door, but as soon as someone moved she went back under the bed.  At the evening we sort of felt bad for the mom as she was meowing all around the house and gave back the kitten and they stayed around this back door on a covered outside area of the house.  We left the house and when we came back at night the mother was meowing again and we couldn't find the kitten. After searching all monday night and the mother meowing through the night, yesterday morning we found the kitten under a canvas covering some stuff on a kind of ""covered roof terrace"" that we have.  Fearing what could happen with this adventurous kitty we took it back inside my room again. She spent part of the day under the bed again and when her mother meowed on the door she meowed back by my door or from under the bed. At night she started going to the glass door and meowing face to face with her mom. As far as we can tell the kitten slept through the night in my room, only starting to meow to her mom at the early morning.  Today we let the kitten with her mom again some time, blocking the exits, basically confining the kitten to this covered outside area and inside the house (the mom can jump the blocks). She tried to drink some milk and they played and ate some dry cat food and drank water together.  Since we never had a cat I don't know if what we're doing is right, given the circumstances. Should we keep letting them have some time together during part of the day and separate them for most of the day and all night, even though they meow for each other and see each other through the glass? I don't know if this can harm them psychologically, especially the kitten. Will the mother eventually just ""abandon"" the kitten? When the mother goes away the kitten comes back to my room and she has improved a lot more than I expected. She plays with a paper ball I gave her and last night she was exploring my room and even slept by my feet, played with me and let me pet her a little.  Sorry for writing almost a book of backstory, I really tried to trim it down a lot, but I also wanted to give as much information as possible and sometimes I'm very wordy.  Thank you in advance. "
1292,What options can I give my dog to stop her peeing in the house?,I have a 6 year old 13 lb little doggie named Pearl.  She seems to pee on the carpet about 1-2 times per week.  My wife and I both work and so Pearl is home alone for 6-8 hours during the day without anybody to take her out to pee.  My wife won't let me do a doggie door.  Is there some way to teach Pearl to stop peeing on the carpet and to give her some alternative place to pee?  What devices or products are out there that I can get so she can pee on those instead of my carpet? 
1293,Can I use any type of wood shaving for my hamster,"I recently bought a hamster and I've been reading on different types of hamsters bedding to use on it's cage.  Currently I'm using self made paper bedding (made out of toilet paper) but it's quite time consuming to make, considering the amount needed to cover the cage. The most common and recommended paper beddings (like care fresh and cozy n' fun) doen't sell in my country. Actually, there are a very few options (I mean, very few options!) to buy hamster bedding or anything similar.  The most common one, sold in almost every petstore online (local pet store is even more scarce) is wood shavings and this is where my doubt begins. All blogs, petstores, youtube videos, hamsters owners, etc.. All of them sell/use wood shavings made from pine or eucalyptus.  When looking on blogs, youtube videos, etc. general content from outside my country, all of them have completely banned these wood types as they are toxic to the hamsters. No one seems to be using these types and do not recommend. But in my country it's widely used and no one seems to make a deal out of it or complain about any problems.  Wood shavings here is something very very easy to obtai. Some woodshop even give it for free, you just need to go there and take how much you want.     I'm not talking about using wood shaving too small or dusty, they are usually big pieces of wood shaving (considering the hamster size).   So what can I do in this case? Is it really prohibited to use these types? Should I keep only the paper bedding? A mix of these 2 types?  As a last alternative, there is cat pellets, but they are not comfy, are usually pressed wood and do not provide any habilit to dig under. "
1294,Is there a way to repair apple snail shell damage?,"My snails have damage on their shells. I think they had a calcium deficiency, and ate each other's shells to make up for it. I've changed their diet, and things seem to be getting better. Now I'm concerned that their eaten shells are too weak and may leave them vulnerable.  Is there a way that I can repair the shells? Something that I can put on the shells to reinforce them, or at the least, protect them from being eaten further?    "
1295,Why does our cat display her belly?,"When my husband and I are having a discussion, our cat Cleo often joins us.  She rolls over on her back, and holds her paws close to her chin, and gives us (what we call) blinky eyes.  It's so adorable we just have to notice her.  On several occasions we intentionally tried to ignore this super cuteness, when we do, she will gently tap our ankles with her paws, or get up and move closer to us.   So is this behavior called attention seeking?  Or is she, in her own way, joining our conversation?    We have also noticed that if I am in one place, such as the kitchen, and he is the living room, she displays her belly near him.  Is she acknowledging my husband as top cat of the household? "

1298,Can I help a pet snake through the molting process?,"My friend's pet snake is starting to molt and since this is (the owner's) first experience through a molting, he is concerned.  We know to apply some humidity to help, but are there other techniques that would aid the process, or other things we should be concerned with?  While I see utility in ""My leopard gecko sometimes has trouble shedding. How can I help?"", geckos and snakes are dissimilar enough (snakes don't have limbs to help themselves shed; geckos and snakes have different diets - what's going on with my molting snake not eating, does he need food?) that the gecko answer is not necessarily sufficient for a snake molting question. "
1299,Canine insulin injection -- what am I doing wrong?,"My dog was recently diagnosed with diabetes, so I have been giving her twice-daily insulin injections for the past 10 days. I've watched my vet do it, I've watched dozens of YouTube videos, and I've read everything I can find about the proper technique, but somehow, I can't seem to get it right.  Every time I inject my dog, she fidgets when I insert the needle, but not overly much, but as soon as I begin to inject the insulin itself, she yelps and either jerks away, or tries to bite me. More than once I've ended up with bent syringes and insulin on her fur because of it.  I'm following the procedure as shown, for example, in this video: [website]Take the insulin out of the fridge and roll it around to mix it up. Draw out slightly more than the needed dose into a new fresh syringe, tap out the air bubbles, then return the excess. Allow the syringe to warm up in my hand for several minutes as I prepare and put out the dogs' food. After my dog is finished her meal, I pull her onto my lap and find a place where the skin is loose. I have been rotating between left and right shoulder and left and right rump so far. Pull up a fold of skin (""tent"" it) between my fingers. Push the needle into the middle of the folder at ~45 degree angle Slowly inject the contents of the syringe.   From everything I've read, this is supposed to be so painless that the dog may not even acknowledge that anything happened, but my dog is getting progressively more anxious each time I do it. I thought I would have gotten the hang of it by now, but I seem to be getting worse.  My main concern is that I'm doing something wrong and injecting the insulin incorrectly; my vet said something about making sure I was doing a subdural and not an intradermal injection, but how would I know? As far as I can tell I'm getting the needle beneath the skin correctly: it's hard to tell with my dog's long hair, but I'm not feeling any resistance to either the needle or the fluid, and the needle's not coming back out of the skin.  (I've done the practicing on the orange bit, and I think I have it right, but oranges don't yelp when you mess up :( )  Is there something else I can do to make sure I do this injection properly, or at least reassure myself that I'm not hurting my dog and that her insulin is going where it should?

1300,How to locate trigger of atopic dermatitis,"If you know that a cat has atopic dermatits (diagnosed by veterinarian), how can you know what triggers it?

1302,New older cat coming into the house,"I have had my current cat for about 2 years now. She is a lovely manx.   3 months ago we moved to my parents house where there was a small foxy, who she was fine with, but never came closer than an arms length away from, sometimes she would hiss at him and try to claw him. But this was very rare.  Over the time I have had her I have only been scratched once, and that was surely on accident.   She is very play-full but loves to sleep all day as cats do.   We have just moved into a new larger home then we have had before and she seems to have been fitting in nicely with no other animals around.   However we have adopted a new cat who is about a year + older then her, and is a male. He seems nice and friendly.   What I want to know is how they might get along, and do you have any tips on introducing them to each other?  Will they use the same cat litter? Will they eat the same dry food? - I am getting them two wet food bowls. But Marshmallow ( current cat ) tends to take a day or two to finish one bowl of food, she isn't really a big eater.   Thanks in advance.  "
1303,How can I clean the slate tile in my terrarium without damaging it?,"I keep my leopard gecko on unfinished slate tile.   To clean the tile I use the below reptile-safe disinfectant (image source and more info here):    and a scourer or scrubbing brush:     (image sources here and here)  However, this leaves me with scratch marks on the slate, which doesn't look very nice.  What am I doing wrong? Is the disinfectant too powerful? Should I be using something softer than the scourer/brush? Should I not be scrubbing when the slate is wet?  I don't want to risk not cleaning the terrarium properly, but I also don't want to keep damaging the slate. What can I do? "
1304,How can I test a rabbit's vision?,"I'm starting to wonder if my vision on my rabbit is failing. We've had her for 3 years and she seems startled when I come over to her.

1306,What's the reason for my cat going missing?,I have a 3 year old male cat who has been neutered. He's name is Meow Meow and I had since he was about 3 or 4 weeks old. We've been very close and bonded really well. I have never been away from him for longer than the usual 8 hour work day.. maybe a night or two as well when I would sleep over somewhere.  The problem is that I left on the 6th December to go to Port Elizabeth for my sister's wedding. It's a 10 hour drive from where I live and I returned on the 14th December (8 days). Upon returning I found that Meow has just dissapeared. My other 3 cats are still here though. I had a family friend who came over each morning to let the cats out the house and feed them. She would return late afternoon to feed them again and let them back into the house.  She told me Meow was there on Sunday morning but when I got back home Sunday afternoon he was gone. He would never be gone for more than a few hours but it's been a whole 5 days now.  I'm starting to think that he left because he thought I wasn't coming back. Is this possible? Do cats behave and think in such terms?

1310,Can you get a cat used to a new house by putting butter on their paws?,"I was recently told a trick about how to get your cat used to a new house, after moving. The trick is to put butter on the cat's paws. The cats will lick the butter off their paws, and as they associate cleaning with places they like, they'll start associating the new house with a safe place. It's NLP anchoring for cats, apparently.  Is this correct? Can this really be used to make a cat feel comfortable in a new house? "
1311,"Bettas and Air (""oxygenating water"")","I'm about to transport a Betta on a few hours road trip for the holiday. That will mean a few hours in a jar (I know, not ideal, but it's better than going a long period without food.)  My son was worried, asking me to poke air holes in the lid.  I said that water is made of hydrogen and oxygen, and the fish will breathe with gills the way we get oxygen from the air with lungs.  A coworker said that (some) fish need their water oxygenated...but I'm not sure how that works when water is H2O?  So the questions, as I promised my son I'd ask:   Would the Betta require air holes in the lid of the jar?  How does water become ""oxygenated""?  EDIT: If water is H2O, how does it become further oxygenated, especially if it isn't under pressure? H2O would mean that water itself is composed of oxygen and hydrogen...I don't think fish would like to breath H2O2... "

For example, if they see a dog on TV, would it look to them like a dog on TV without any ""distortion""?  The reason I think there may be distortion to them is because TV is designed for our eyes (e.g. red, green, and blue ""dots"" that match the receptors in our eyes).  This is somewhat related to this question: Do dogs really only see in black and white?. "

1317,How to get kitten to stop playing with aluminum blinds,"I adopted a kitten in November, and she's nearly 6 months old now. Within the last couple of weeks, she's been trying to climb the aluminum blinds in my apartment. I prefer to keep the blinds down for most of the day as we live on the ground floor of our complex.  There are two sets of blinds in the apartment, one in the bedroom, and one smaller set in the living room. One suggestion we received was to put double-sided tape on the window sill to discourage her going on to it. It worked until she found she could step carefully in the areas we didn't/couldn't get to. I don't want to discourage her chilling in the window, or even climbing through the blinds to the other side to sit. What I'd like to discourage is her trying to climb the blinds.  Initially I believed it may be due to the cord hanging down, and she was trying to get a better reach at it, but when I pull the cord down to a more reachable distance, she still preferred to climb the blinds. This makes me believe that it's more of a vertical issue, rather than a catching issue. Her interest in them is also dependent on our proximity to the window. I don't spend a lot of time in the living room, but when I'm out there she tries to climb it, and every night when I go to bed, she tries to climb those.  I currently do not own any cat towers or anything of that nature, simply due to not having the requisite amount of space to put it anywhere, as well as the possibility that I may have to move in the near future.  Another suggestion we received was to buy a spray bottle and spray her with it when she tries to climb, which is good for immediate feedback, but terrible for all of the reasons you can find by googling it.  Is this being a vertical issue a safe assumption to make? If so, what sort of things can I try to get her to reduce, or stop her attempts at climbing up the blind? If not, what else might it be? "
1318,Can cats survive on a diet composed of insects?,"I saw in This question that cats cannot survive on a vegan diets alone, but what if the diet included common insects?

Age: We don't really know its age but I can give you some info which will help you deduce it's age...  -It's eyes are open.  -It only drinks milk. Refuses to eat biscuits or bread.  -It is light enough for me to pick up with one hand. (I'm fourteen)  -It is about 10 inches in length.  I also noticed that it is covered with a lot of tiny bugs and attracts a lot of flies... Anything that can be done about this?  PS: The only reason it isn't already living with me is because my mom won't allow it... "

I ask because I have two cats and am randomly find a whisker here and there for the one cat.

1321,Why is my cat drooling on simbadol?,"Over the weekend my cat (10 years old, female, spayed) developed some kind of urinary problem (she was going to the litter box every 5 minutes, only producing a few drops). She went to the vet on Monday morning and the vet gave her an injection of simbadol (1.8mg/ml, 0.8ml dose, so 1.44 mg for a 13.75 pound cat) to treat her pain/discomfort.  The vet warned me that the medication would make her high. An hour after returning home she started drooling. I called the vet and they said drooling is normal on this medication (I told them that she was producing Santa Claus worthy beards, and they said that was fine, just try to keep her clean).  I tend to associate foaming drool (like she's doing) with anxiety. Is the drug making her anxious? What other reasons could the drug be making her drool like this?   "
1322,Just rescued a bunny... Not eating any hay or rabbit food,"My mom rescued a bunny that was abandoned in a house for about 9 months, and we got her a nice big cage, with plenty of chews, and lots of hay and rabbit food. Our neighbor was feeding the bunny, but she could never catch her and she ate her food them but she isn't anymore. I've had her for 3 days, and yesterday I gave her half a carrot and about 2 or 3 broccoli. I mixed her regular Timothy pellets (her regular food she isn't eating) with Timothy hay (also something she isn't eating) with some dry oats and the carrot and broccoli. She ate everything except her pellets and hay. I know she needs to say both of them, but I'm not sure how to get her to want to eat them. What should I do??  "
1323,Dog keeps eating my cats medicated food,"I have a new puppy and I am trying to train him not to eat the cat food. The cat has worms, so I take some fancy feast and put some liquid wormer in it. Because the cat is still spooked by the dog, I have noticed he wont eat all of his food in one sitting. My dog is waking up in the middle of the night and eating the cat's medicated food.  Will this hurt him? and are there any other ways besides putting him in his kennel to get him to stop? I don't want the kennel to be punishment, and he is a barker when I put him in the kennel making it hard to sleep. What do I do? "
1324,How do i heat and/or build multiple snake enclosures?,I am starting to get setup for snake breeding (balls) and I am lost on the process of multi enclosures. It is hard to find information about getting started with them and best practices/equipment to use because most links on google are just people selling them.   I am going to need at least 8 enclosures for the baby snakes and I was wondering if people build their own racks or if they just buy them online? If you build your own do you need a separate thermostat for each or just one thermostat hooked to all the (tape I assume) if it is a multi rack thing. Also should i get heating on all the enclosures or just the back or sides of the rack? Is there a problem with light using the racks?  
1325,Fish tank (Aquarium) as a room divider?,"I am considering to buy a fish tank (~100L). I have not much experience yet, so I am doing a lot of research before committing to something.  While doing, so I have seen fish tanks being used as room divider. I could certainly use a room divider and a fish tank would look beautiful.  But I am concerned: I have read somewhere else you should tape one wall of the fish tank because otherwise fish would be stressed out.  Is that true? Or does it depend on the kind of fish? "

1327,Is using fertilizer in my cat grass bed safe for pets?,"I have a lifted cat grass bed that I grow on my porch. The neighborhood cats are frequently in it, which I encourage and don't mind but it was not my intention in growing it. I feed it to my cockatiel and parakeet, as it is safe for them to eat the grass AND it's seeds. Part of it is growing at a weaker growth and, to put it simply, it looks funky.  It was suggested to me to use fertilizer on it. I have been using my own organic compost for everything I garden, and always rinse what I cut off for my birds before giving it.. just to be safe.  I am curious if using fertilizer in it will make any part of it ""poisonous"" or unsafe for my birds? Or for the neighborhood cats that chew on it? Is rinsing it enough if I do use it? "
1328,Yorkie vs. 10-month old son - how to deal with aggression,"I have a Yorkie named Master Chief and a 10-month old infant named Austin.  I think in general he has been a real sport about the new baby in the house.  It was a major change for all of us, but one he couldn't understand and certainly didn't ask for, so I give him a lot of credit there.  He has tolerated a lot.  Now that my son is crawling around like a mad-man, Chief's gotten a little more aggressive and I'm a little concerned.   One of Chief's major malfunctions quirks is a weird aggression towards people who touch him or his bed (except petting him, especially belly rubs) while in his bed.  If I ever try to move his bed or him, he will start to bite me.  I don't think he's trying to hurt me or draw blood, but he's not messing around either.    He has exhibited this aggression towards my son if he crawls up to his bed while Chief is laying in it.  Chief's main bed is on our bed towards the foot.  Austin (my son) will usually breastfeed and then play in our bed for an hour or two in the morning and that's when that happens.  Chief also has another bed (for the daytime) in the living room, which he doesn't exhibit the same level aggression with, but he can still be pretty protective when he's laying in it.  Chief will stand up, puff up his chest and get this look in his eye and actually (on a few occasions) lunged with his teeth at my boy.  He left a visible mark on his face once (no blood).  We got a small plush ball (grapefruit sized) for Austin.  Chief immediately thought it was his and got pretty protective of it.  We correct him whenever possible or take it away, but this has caused a couple issues when Austin has grabbed the ball and Chief didn't like it.  Austin will occasionally grab one of Chief's toy balls and I've seen a few different actions.  I've seen Chief get aggressive, I've also seen him get playful like he wants Austin to throw the ball (of course he doesn't and at that point Chief usually tries to forcefully, but playfully, take it from him - and he usually accidentally hurts Austin at that point which we now try to avoid by not having Chief's balls around Austin).  There have been a couple other cases, some just (seemingly) completely random.  He's only left a mark that one time, but he's definitely lunged and bit a few times - usually either missing or me or my wife are there to grab him or push him in the nick of time.  We obviously (especially recently) don't leave them together without supervision.  We weren't too worried about this before.  Chief never had issues until Austin was about 7 months.  tl;dr: So my question is: is there anything I can do to try to keep my Yorkie from exhibiting aggression when my 10-month old son crawls up to his bed while he's sleeping in it?  And what tips (in general) can you give me for taming his aggression towards my son in other situations?  Thank you "
1329,Film on surface of female betta tank,"I recently took in one of my friends male Bettas to treat it for for ich (ichthyophhirius). When I brought him back I noticed a film on the surface of her other Betta's tank (this one is a female). It's a small 2 gallon hexagonal tank with a mini filter, that is made for 1-3 gallons and has a very slow trickle. The same filter is powered by a pump that also runs a bubbler that she has attached by a t-valve, so both have little power. It is to my knowledge that Bettas, especially in small tanks need little water movement due to the fact they naturally thrive in ditches and rice patties. But what I saw made me a little concerned. Her tank has film at the top. I used her net and swiped up the film best I could. It wasn't sludgy, it was actually more clear, almost white as it became dry. I asked her about it and she said that only her females tank does that. Her male is in an identical tank and he makes bubble nests all the time. She switched them from each having their own bowl to these tanks about 6 months ago and said her females bowl had the film then too.  I am familiar with the idea of a film being caused by a poor tank environment, algae, or not being clean enough but her water is clear, and her gravel looks clean too. I'd like to be able to recommend a fix for her if one exists but I'm not sure if this is normal for female bettas. She has no live plants and no other fish or invertebrates in either setup, so I'm confused by there being a difference.  What could this film be? Is there a film that only females make, possibly for reproduction? Or is this a sign that maybe her tiny setup isn't doing enough? Or a mix of both? "
1330,Turtles: Fresh water in aquarium turned red after few minutes,"Around 30-40 mins ago I changed aquarium water, cleaned the filter and dropped some toya food for my turtles. Now I am seeing water turned red, I have already checked there are no cuts, bites or bruises on turtles.  What could be the reason, why water is red? Is this infection? Could it effect me also because I changed water with my hands, w/o any gloves, using buckets.  Infos:   The source of the new water is city Supply = tap water = hard water. Its the same source of supply from past 9 years for them. Touchwood! There growth is pretty good. I change the water whenever I see that the water is too cloudy due to food, I change the water, approx in every 20-30 days. I have been feeding same food for a pretty long time. It always seemed that they like it because the moment I drop the food they grab it like they are hungry from ages.  I do not use anything for dechlorination. Looks like I don't need dechlorination. They are going w/o it. I Did not use one or employ other techniques such as ageing my water.  "
1331,What is the optimal age to bring home kittens?,"I have done some Google'ing into when is a good time to bring home kittens, and I have read articles where the most common answer is ""12 weeks but above 8 and you should be fine"".  I also read that if you bring home the kittens a little sooner, it could have pros and cons:   Pros: the kittens might not have fully accepted their current location as their home, so bringing them home sooner should make the transition easier for them. Cons: the kittens learn behavior from their mother at around 12 weeks which they would be deprived of if taken home too soon.   What would be the best age to bring home kittens? Will getting 2 from the same litter reduce the chance of behavioural issues if taken earlier than 12 weeks? "
1332,"How long does ""giving birth"" last for a molly?",How long does it take a fish to finish delivery of babies? She is a molly. I noticed two fry swimming around a day ago and haven't seen any more. Has she finished giving birth? 
1333,X-ray of my cat shows strange rib shape,"I found a wild cat, which has a difficulty with breathing, it seems that her nose is blocked and a lot of saliva is coming out.  Beside that, we went to a vet to check this cat, blood test, temp., x-ray... so after taking x-ray we saw that her ribs have a strange shape. Local vet says that it seems that this cat suffered possible impact in that area, but he is not sure.  Her condition, beside difficulty of breathing is normal, she eats regularly, she drink water also she is happy and wants to play with me.  My question is; is it possible that x-ray is mistaken, because of a sudden movement?  Also second x-ray in different cat position shows different shape of ribs.  Can anyone explain, how can I interpret it?     "
1334,Swollen cat lip,  What could be the cause of the swollen lip? Any ideas and tips for a cure? We would rather not give him medication for this. 
1335,I got bitten by an almost 1 month puppy,"I got bitten, on my nose, by an almost 1 month old puppy. I had a scratch. I bled for sometime and then stopped. I had applied alcohol to the spot.  I don't know whether the puppy has rabies or not.  Now my question is do I need to visit a doctor?  Also do I need to take the puppy to vet?  "
1336,Dog with open wound on leg and no vet available,"I found this dog in a graveyard, probably waiting to die, with a huge open wound on it's backside 2 days ago. I've been feeding it, helping it regain it's strength but I'm concerned, the wound may get infected. What should I do? I live in a small town. We don't have vets that tend to canines here. How do I tend to the wound without hurting the dog or getting bitten myself?     "
1337,Preventing hens from eating plants,My neighbor's hens always nibble of our flowering plants and herbs. We've tried fencing and everything yet they still somehow manage to get to the plants. Is there some way to prevent them from eating the plants? A repellent or something that would work? 
1338,"My Cat was cross eyed, now she’s not. Why?","I got my cat half a year ago at a rescue centre, she was very cross eyed, the longer she has been in my home the more her cross eyed ness has gone. Is this normal? And what has caused this?  ([website]"
1339,Cat's nose leaking drops when pet,"When I pet my cat, she purrs and leaks tiny drops of clear liquid from the base of her nose. When she's really enjoying herself she can leak a drop or two every minute.   My first guess is that it may be pheromones, but it seems to leak from the vomeronasal organ...  Does anyone know what this dicharge is? Is it normal, or is it an indication that my cat should see a Veteranarian? "
1340,Training for Canine Parking Lot Anxiety (?),"I am fortunate enough to be able to take my dog on an afternoon outing (nearly everyday) with the goal of wearing her out. We typically stop at one of the local grocers on the way home for any missing dinner ingredients. I have noticed that she occasionally displays somewhat anxious behaviors when I get back to the car. Some parking lots seem to upset her more than others.  This morning we ran an errand and I pulled into a parking lot to ""get one thing"". I stopped the car and my girl popped up onto the center arm rest, shaking. As if she was terrified of being there. Clearly an anxiety issue. My impromptu solution was to leave without going into the store. My pup is more important and after we drove off, she was fine again.   My guesses are:   someone tried to reach into the car while she was alone (to pet her, or take her)? the noise and general chaos of a busy parking lot overwhelms her she saw something that upset her (which could be litterally anything)   I'm concerned about this. I can prevent it from happening again by never leaving her alone in the car again, but that doesn't seem very practical. Eventually I'll have to leave her in the car (for any number of reasons). Is there a realistic way to train her to not be afraid if she's alone in the car? Or some way to help her feel safer when she is?  Note: My dog gets 1-2 half hour walks, a 1-2 hour outing, and a beef neck bone to chew on (daily average). Outings = dog park playtime, off leash on wooded trails, learning to run beside my bicycle, etc. "
1341,Leave a dog alone during night/daytime?,"Where I live there are some regulations about leaving your pet alone. I don't know the details but I guess it is ok to leave a dog alone for a couple of hours, while fishes probably can be left alone for days as long as they are fed.  Anyway, I rarely leave my dog alone for more than an hour so it is not a problem anyway but I was thinking about the purposes behind this legislation and for dogs it is quite simple, they need to take a walk every few hours and they are pack animals that don't like to be left alone.  BUT, every night when I sleep I leave the dog ""alone"" for 8-9 hours. Obviously this is fine because the dog mostly sleeps during the night anyway and, here is my question: does a dog who wakes up in the middle of the night and realise that its human is in the house feel alone because there is no interaction between human and dog? Or is it satisfied by being able to smell and hear the human?  And a second question: the answer to my first question is quite obviously something like ""most dogs are happy with being near a human during the night and don't need any direct interaction with the human to feel good"" but that might be because dogs, like humans, sleep during the night. However, I frequently take a 3-4 hour nap during the day when my dog is supposed to be awake and active. Is this ""cruel"" to the dog? The (sound) idea behind the legislation I mentioned in the beginning is that dogs need company and stimulation and, if I sleep during the day, I obviously can't provide my dog with that.  (I can add that my dog usually sleeps on the floor next to my bed when I take my naps. It doesn't do anything the indicates it is sad, annoyed or something like that. It might look bored but that isn't really connected to me sleeping: it looks bored now when I write this question because I don't play with it or stimulate it in any other way. But that's a dog's life, I guess!) "
1342,How is GFO reactor better than PhosBan medium in the filter?,"I have a cyanobacteria problem. I am using PhosBan/Phosguard as a filter medium and it doesn't really work that well, shall I worry of getting a GFO reactor or am I good with how it is? How would GFO be different?  my setup:   30 gallons tank 5 cichlids about 3-4 inches long Fluval FX6 running all the time (bottomfloor is clean) 1 feeding a day, with 1 pinch of cichlids food air at high flow with long diffuser some sunlight in the morning for about 2 hours some plants struggling to grow plant lamp on a timer from 2 pm to 8 pm over the wall topfin filter with PhosGuard medium, changed every 2 months tap water with primer + seachem additives changed 1 time a week   problem is the green patches on the rocks and glass that are hard to scrub off, and it keeps spreading  it used to have brown algae all over and little cyano here and there until i started using PhosGuard  now brown algae is gone and it's just cyano and it spreads like a wildfire  "
1343,How can I tell if my cat is happy?,"As a cat owner, I'd of course like to know if my cat is happy. However, most known indicators don't really apply; purring seems to happen for a variety of emotions, meowing vary greatly between different cats and they do not wag their tails like dogs do to express themselves...   So this makes me wonder, do cats use some universal ""clues"" to show their happiness, like a special body language for example? If so, what are they? "
1344,Are there pet safe ways to eliminate static in pet fur beyond a humidifier? (especially in rabbits),"I have 2 rabbits and in the winter they become so full of static, that I cant even pet them without a giving/receiving a static shock.  Using a humidifier helps a great deal. Yet, even with relative humidity at 50% static shocks begin after just a few strokes across their back.   While this isn't surprising as rabbit hair is one of the most positively charged natural substances on earth, it's quite annoying as the discharge is usually to the rabbits ears or nose, or to my face.  I'd love to find another way to combat it that won't harm my rabbits.  Are there any natural and safe to eat anti-static treatments?  Am I correct to assume that dryer sheets, diluted fabric softener, and/or anti static salon products are too toxic to use on a pet? "
1345,Are carrots a healthy part of a rabbit diet?,"Pretty much every iconic image of Bugs Bunny shows him with a carrot in his hand/paw. For many people, this image of Bugs is one of the first things which pops into their mind when considering what to feed a bunny.  If you put a carrot in with a bunny, they will be extremely happy and do their best to eat the whole thing no matter how big, in a single meal.  So it must be good, right?  When it comes to pet rabbit diet, is Bugs Bunny a good role model? "
1346,"My rabbit is digging at the carpet in the corner of the living room, what should I do?","Sometimes when my bunny is out running around the house she will go in the corner and dig at the carpet.  I stomp and clap my hands while saying ""No"" sternly, and she stops but will often go back to doing it a while later.  Sometimes months will pass without her digging like this, then it will start again and I have to keep a close eye on her for a while.  How can I modify this behavior? Is there anything I can do to limit or prevent it? "
1347,How successful is Cancer treatment?,"About 3 years ago, my cat was diagnosed with Cancer (Lymphoma).  The vet told us that if we went with surgery, the best we could hope for is another year or two before it returned.  She was 10 years old at the time and already to the point where she was eating very little due to her stomach being constricted by the tumor.  We had her put down the following week.  Are there types of cancer where treatment is actually a viable option?  How likely is it to even diagnose when odds of success are good?  (In my cat's case, an x-ray done 7 months prior showed no signs of a tumor). "
1348,What would cause an oral polyp to recur in my cat?,"About a year ago my then-newly-adopted adult male cat had a small growth under his tongue, which my vet removed and biopsied.  It was a benign fibrous polyp, which I understand sometimes happens.  Now, almost a year later, he has another one (much smaller so far) in the same place.  My vet was surprised; she said they don't usually come back like that.  The surgeon who removed the first one happened to be there so we consulted her too, and she said she'd never seen that before and she believed she'd left a large enough ""buffer zone"" in removing the first one, but she'll leave a larger one this time.  My vet recommends removing and biopsying this one and I will follow that recommendation.  My question is: what might be causing this?  Should I expect it to happen yet again in the future?  Is there anything I should be doing to reduce the likelihood of recurrence?  The cat is estimated to be about 5 years old, indoor-only, and eats standard dry and canned food with the occasional treat.  He is missing several of his teeth (incisors); we don't know why (he came that way).  I understand that sometimes polyps form around foreign bodies; this was not the case the first time.  I'm not aware of any mouth injuries and he hasn't been in any fights involving biting. "
1349,At what age cats should stop biting and scratching games?,"I have a Maine Coon kitten who is 1.5 months old. When he's playful, he starts biting and scratching whenever he sees your arm next to him, and any hand movement is like an invitation to bite. Trying to put a hand on his back causes him to roll over and fight it with claws and teeth. Same is with feet. He even purrs when biting. He never purrs when playing with toys.  When he's sleepy, he's nice and sweet, purring and allowing to be petted. He sleeps next to us, so he doesn't hate us.  Different internet resources divide into two groups: some say 'He's just a kitten, it's totally fine, he'll stop', and others say 'If I don't teach him not to bite, he'll bite all his life'.  We've tried playing with him with toys, tried screaming when it's painful, tried spraying with water once, nothing seems to be working really. At most, he switches to something else, and next time he wants to bite again, he bites.  So, maybe he's really too young to stop just yet? At what age they stop biting on their own? "
1350,What is most appropriate age to neuter/spay a cat?,"What is the most appropriate age to neuter or spay a cat?  Does gender, way he behaves, time of year, anything else affect it? There is a related question, which I think should be linked, but doesn't exactly answer the question: How does early desexing affect my cats? "
1351,How do I trance my rabbit?,I have heard that you can trance a rabbit to help with tasks such as nail clipping and cleaning the underside.  Is doing this safe for my rabbit?  How do I do it? Are there other applications where this is effective? 
1352,Does hissing always mean fear or aggression?,"Does hissing always mean fear or aggression or it can be a part of the play?   Sometimes when playing hide-and-seek or chase games with a kitten, he allows himself to be chased into a corner, and then he turns and hisses. Does it mean we've overdone something, like stayed too close or chased too far, or it is of no concern in such games at all and is a healthy part of them?  Note, these games do not include intentional startling, hurting, holding or carrying him around against his will. "
1353,"What is a ""bunny burrito"" and when would I use it?","I have heard about rabbit owners using a ""bunny burrito"" as part of their rabbit grooming process.    What is it?   How and when should it be used? "
1354,Budgerigar parakeet is picking at her leg band. What should I do?,"We have a budgerigar parakeet with a leg band.  Lately, she has been picking at the leg band with her beak.  Is there any way we can get her to stop picking at her leg band, or does the leg band need to be removed?  If it needs to be removed, is there a way to do this myself, or does a vet need to do it? "
1355,Balancing on two front paws while defecating,"I noticed that when my poodle needs to defecate, he often stands on his two front paws; lifting the rear half of his body upwards toward a tree.  He has done this ever since I've rescued him off the street last year.  I've never seen any other dog exhibit this kind of behavior.      Why would he be doing this?  Is this normal?  Should I be concerned at all? "
1356,How do I motivate a cat to drink more water?,"When one has determined that a cat is drinking too little water, how can one stimulate him to drink more?  I don't mean medical or other immediate cases, so syringe is out of the question, I mean to get him to drink on his own on a regular basis?  I've seen a suggestion to add a little bit of cow milk to water, but it seemed rather wrong, and, again, very short-term, as   adult cats may be intolerant to dairy products; vet said combination with some food can cause diarrhoea.  "
1357,Does a rabbit's activity level impact the dietary limits of sugars?,"According to guidelines posted by the House Rabbit Society, sugar (from fruits, etc) intake should be limited for rabbits. A comment in a question about rabbit diet suggested that bunnies that are more active could have a higher percentage of sugar in their diet than less active rabbits.   Can you safely increase the sugary foods given to a rabbit if they are more active?  If so, how do you define what the activity level to sugar ratio is? "
1358,Is there benefit to feeding my cats cat food that incorporates fruits and vegetables?,"At the pet store this weekend, we were approached by a sales representative marketing a ""gourmet"" pet food brand.  One of the biggest selling points was apparently that the food contains ""wholesome whole grains, garden veggies and healthy fruit"", in addition to meat.  While I understand that vegetable products such as corn meal are frequently used as fillers for dry pet food, I question the value of fruits and vegetables being added to cat food, since cats are obligate carnivores.  The main selling point was that the first ingredient on the list of each of their foods were ""real meats"" (as opposed to meat by-products), so presumably the food contains enough crude animal proteins to meet the cats primary dietary requirements, but does adding fruit and vegetables have any actual health benefits to a cat?  Or is it just a marketing gimmick, playing on people's assumption that if the food sounds appealing to them, it might be more appealing to their cats? "
1359,How to make my cats poo in certain area of my yard/garden?,"I have three cats that usually make their business on a regular indoor litter box and also outside everywhere over the garden. They often spend the night outside, or even some days if I travel.  Is there a way to make them poo in ceratin area of the yard/garden? I would like to set an area and not have to clean it at all. I don't know if it is possible on earth ground. Maybe with some sand, hay, pellets or other materials that help degradation and could be regularly added.  Would they feel attracted by this king of ""litter box""? Would it be naturally clean enought for their taste? "
1360,Can bunny rabbits snore?,My rabbit makes a squeaking sound when she sleeps.    Is this normal?  Can rabbits snore? 
1361,What can I do to help my rabbit breathe more easily?,"When my lionhead rabbit tries to relax, even while he's eating, he begins to emit a wheezing sound and his whole body begins to rock.  I've been told this is rabbit snoring and is normal.  However, as the rabbit falls more deeply into sleep, the snoring gets extremely loud and more grunt- and gurgle-like; his breathing becomes irregular, and begins to mimic someone having an asthma attack. Moreover, his body begins to shake and it almost looks like he is convulsing.  It is clear that this isn't very comfortable for him, and is probably causing a type of bunny sleep apnea, as he tends to be less engaged than my other rabbit.  Is there anything I can do to help my bunny breathe better?  I've noticed controlling the humidity in my house does seem to reduce the loudness of the snoring.  Video my bun sleeping as requested. "
1362,How common is it for cats to snore?,"I've noticed lately that both of my adult, non-elderly cats tend to snore when sleeping.  Usually they're sleeping on their sides or curled up when this happens.  (I don't notice it in ""meatloaf"" position, and they don't sleep on their backs.)  They don't appear to be in any distress, and we've just been to the vet for a routine exam and gotten a clean bill of health.  Is snoring normal?  Are there particular factors that affect it, like diet or environment?  We did get told that they're both a bit overweight and we'll be taking measures to deal with that.  But we're not talking Garfield-class cats here; they should each lose a pound or so.  (They're both 13-pound regular domestic housecats, no identifiable breed.) "
1363,Changing cat food necessary if no better results in coat?,"I have 1 year old cat with poor coat, I visited a vet several times but he says there is nothing wrong with the cat. His recommendation was to change the cat food.  When I fed my cat ""Royal Canin Persian Kitten"" his coat was average. Then the vet asked me to switch from ""Royal Canin"" to ""Josera Cat Food"". I didn't see any improvement in his coat. Now the vet wants me to switch to ""Royal Canin Skin and Care Nutrition"" which is really expensive.    Should I switch food again? Is a poor coat the result of feeding only dry food, and wet food once or twice a month? What should I feed my cat to improve his coat?  "
1364,"Cat biting me, seems odd","So my cat has a strong bond with me. But I notice sometimes he will give me a love bite when I scratch his back or pet his belly. More often it happens when I scratch him. Why does he give me a love bite when I scratch his back? Does he not like being scratched there or what is going on? Before, he wouldn't bite me at all, just purr when I pet his belly or scratched his back. "
1365,When will my momma platy give birth?,"Judging from this photo, can anyone tell me when my momma platy is going to give birth? I’ve put her in her own 3 gallon tank because the other male fish in the community tank harass her, and I’m afraid they’re all going to eat the fry as soon as they come out. My momma platy has been hiding near the bottom for a couple of days now. I’m scared she’s stressed, and I’m not sure of what to do. Besides from gauging when she’ll be giving birth, might you be able to provide some tips on what to do once the fry emerge? "
1366,"Kitten is suddenly paralyzed, refuses to eat and leaves","We had adopted a feral kitten, It was very difficult to get her into our control as she would be scared if we tried to hold her but we continued to keep her food outside so that she eats it.   After few months(7 months) she became friendlier. I was very much attached to her. She used to stay out whole day and at night slept in our bathroom inside.   One day even after calling a lot of times she didn't come out of the bathroom, When I went inside she was struggling to walk. She had lost control of her rear legs and was trying to drag from the front feet.   I immediately took her to vet. The vet examined her . I informed that she had been attacked by a stray cat on her head a few months ago, but that had cured by now.  I was told that she's anemic and the vet put her some drips and injection(maybe pain killers) but couldn't really determine the cause of this sudden paralysis.  While she was still on that drips, she dilated her eyes and stretched her legs. The vet gave answer. I couldn't digest the fact. I called her repeatedly, petted her and with my calls she again started 'meow'ing. I was happy again. She hadn't eaten anything from the day of this sudden paralysis(2 days ago) I went home, she still refused to eat, couldn't move around. She had lost her control of moving. After few hours, she was serious again(dilated eyes, stretched out legs, no response) I ran immediately to see the vet. On the way, she was trying to tell something(it was continuous movement of mouth like chewing) She called out 'meow' twice. She took heavy breaths twice and lay motionless. She just left me.  Many questions were left unanswered. Hope anyone tries answering to it.  i)How did my kitten who was playful and healthy suddenly become paralyzed overnight?  ii)Why was she anemic even after feeding her the healthiest of foods?  iii)Did the attack on head by other cats affect her so deeply? But that was like 2 months ago and had already cured.  iv)How could she die in a span of just 2 days after sudden paralysis?  She wasn't even a year old. How could she leave me :( "
1367,How to cool a dwarf hamster in hot weather,"Our djungarian hamster is apparently getting hot when temperatures reach about 25°C. She then sleeps outside her house, in a corner of her terrarium, leaning on the glass and looking annoyed. She also tried to dig deep, probably an instinct to make a hole deep enough to get into colder regions of soil.  As the weather will get even hotter during the summer and we don't have airconditioning, what could we do to make the hamster feel better? Would it help to add some small fan (like a computer cooling fan) to circulate air in the terrarium? Or add some rocks or other objects outside and inside her house with higher thermal conductivity so that she could cool herself down by leaning on them?    "

1371,My cat always hungry,"My cat had babies 2 weeks back and now whenever she sees me she starts to meow, giving me a sign that she is hungry. But after eating, 5 to 10 minutes later she starts to meow again. She is a normal sized pet cat. I don't know what to do about her hunger. She did eat a lot in her pregnancy. I usually give her meat &amp; chicken, but now when I feed her the same amount she vomits. What should I do to not keep her hungry and not make her sick? A special diet?  "

I don't know their proper names, but I own one bottom feeder fish(the black ones that clean the tank) and five smaller fish that won't grow past two inches, as well as one snail.   I'm curious, would 2 frogs and/or a couple shrimp live comfortably inside a tank of this size? What are the limits when adding other types of animals to a fish tank?  Thanks!  "
1373,Dog strange behavior before pooping,"My dog is a shiba. He is now 16 months old. We live in a hot region in Brazil. This is our first pet, therefore we don't know how to address many suspicious behaviors. Unfortunately, some of these symptoms have lasted for most of his life now, and the vets we have seen so far in the city were unable to effectively help us. The symptoms I'm talking about are related to pooping. He only poops during walks.  These two symptoms have lasted for most of his life now:   He always takes a long time, that is, he seems to need to walk a lot, before he can seem to be able to poop. For most of the minutes before pooping, he gets agitated, like he needs desperately to get free of some pain --- even though this lasts!... as I said, he takes time!   The next two symptoms have occurred before (not always), but are especially strong lately (for many weeks now), making me even more concerned:   Immediately after pooping, he vigorously licks his anus. While walking, he suddenly (very suddenly) sits down with his anus on the ground, or walks strangely with his anus down (a little, not touching the ground), as if something suddenly started to ache.   So what about his feces? They have (almost) never been hard and dry --- rather the contrary: they used to be (seemingly unhealthy) soft most times. This has changed a few weeks ago, after a major dietary change (we are trying things out): before, he used to eat raw meat exclusively; then he started to be fed just cooked meat, rice and potatoes. After that change, his feces seem to be always healthy (neither hard nor soft). However, that dietary change didn't seem to affect the aforementioned symptoms. Not yet.  What could be the problem here? "
1374,Chew proof rope for cats,"I want to build a wall-mounted wood playground for my two indoor cats, almost 2 years old. They aren't that much into chewing, but they do enjoy biting leather shoes and tearing apart sisal ropes and cardboard boxes. I would like to build wooden bridges with a rope material they aren't going to chew away easily, so that I can build the bridges only once.  I considered these alternatives for the ropes material, but each has its pros and cons:   leather rope: it seems sturdy, but I fear not enough to withstand the bites. It's soft enough to be knotted; sisal or hemp rope: they are sturdy indeed and, like leather, can be knotted. I notice (and read online) that cats tend to chew on it with fervor, and straws of sisal could be ingested causing potential troubles in the cat's interiors; rubber wire: elastic and cheap, but I have no references on the internet about how cats deal with them. I fear rubber pieces are nasty if ingested; (plastic coated) iron wire: much sturdier than the other alternatives, but more rigid. My window protections are metal wire webs and they hold well against weight, claws and teeth. I'm more worried about the cats' health if they tried to chew metal and ruined their teeth. Not sure about how plastic coating affects this last point.   The alternative is to coat whatever wire I decide to use with those anti-chewing sprays, but I would rather not if I manage to. Another alternative would be to avoid ""ropes"" altogether and go for a fixed wooden bridge, which could be feasible but is not an answer to the question.  Do you have any chewing experience on any of these material? Can you give advice on these concerns (and possibly other ones I didn't consider)? Thank you. "
1375,Should a mirror be removed from a budgie cage before socializing it with others?,"Today we were gifted with a budgie from an elderly extended family member who is no longer able to care for her along with a cage containing a couple of mirrors. She seems quite transfixed on them and my understanding is they recognize the reflection as another bird instead of themselves. I did some further research and a few posts I've found such as Why should I put mirrors in my budgie's cage? seem to suggest that mirrors are sometimes not such a good idea.  At the moment she's in her original cage with mirrors and we thought we'd leave her that way a few days until she gets used to the new surroundings. But at some point we'd like to place her in a large cage with four other budgies and I'm wondering if maybe the mirrors should be removed for a week or so in advance so she's more likely to socialize with the other birds after being ""alone"" for a while or if that's likely to cause her any stress? "
1376,How to feed stray/wild cat,"I do not have a pet, but every other day a cat comes to us for food. This has been going on for a month now. In our part of the world (subcontinent), the stray cats/dogs will eat just about anything.  I currently give her a cup of milk 2 times a day and she drinks it without much fuss, and occasionally I give her some pieces of meat.   I read that adult cats should not be given milk or wheat products such as bread. Is this valid for all cats or just the house cats. Meat is quite expensive, and if milk is not to be given, then what other food could be the option? Could I give her raw or boiled eggs?  I've seen her catch mice, so she isn't completely dependent. "
1377,how do i keep my goldfish tank's bottom clean?,"my goldfish tank's water is crystal clear and the filter is working fine but goldfish creates a lot of waste so their manure collects on the bottom of the tank(which is bare), is it okay or will it create ammonia spikes? I know that you can siphon out the poop but then you will be doing that every other day, is there any alternatives to this?  btw my tank is a 40 gal with 2 goldfish and 2 pangasius(and 2 red neon lobsters), I'm planning to add more...

1379,Help. A common goldfish living in 3 gallon tank,"My wife got a goldfish from our pre-school. It came in a ""fishbowl"" the size of a large coffee cup and a tiny ziplock with fish food. It was severely stressed: fins clamped at his side, sunken belly, gulping bubbles at the top of the tank, flashing, drifting sideways, etc.  I had a used 3 gallon fish tank, but had no time to set up or cycle. So, I put the ""fish-cup"" in the center of the empty tank and over the period of days, added maybe 4-6 oz per hour of sink water to the fish-cup (I have a RO filter) until the tank water level exceeded the ""fish-cup"" and he could escape into the tank.  He did experience some shock (lethargy), but the flashing and side-drifting stopped. I kept adding RO water and removed and replaced the majority of the water almost daily.  Two days ago I started running the filter for about 4 hours during the day (on a timer). He's not happy about the water-current, but he is alive. He explores (I think he's looking for a way out) and hides in his cave when people are around. He's eating, resting, actively swimming. No flashing, no lethargy. His major stress comes from me exchanging water. He freaks out, but the water needs changing. Right?  I was going to start the kids with aquatic plants then eventually add ghost shrimp. Maybe a betta for Christmas. For all the prior neglect, this goldfish is in much better shape now. I know the tank is too small for the goldfish. I feed him twice daily. I exchange about a half-gallon of the water daily with a pinch of baking soda to offset acidity. But I am not going to do much more. I might add a plant, but I worry anything new might stress him. I've had him for a week now and he seems ok.  I've never had a goldfish before, so I don't know how they act. He seems to pace the tank like a caged tiger. Back and forth, up and down, front and back. After I add fish food, he waits... then stalks like a deep-water shark zipping up from the bottom and attacking at the surface. Is all of this ""goldfish behavior"" and him really needing a huge tank? Am I doing enough for his survival? If he lives a year, I might reconsider getting set up with a much larger tank. I just want to know if I'm giving him a sufficient minimum to survive. "
1380,Is the way I moved my fish to a new tank ok?,"Yesterday I got a new tank, I upgraded from a standard 10 gallon tank to a 29 gallon. The ten gallon was over populated so I decided to try and move my fish over as soon as I could. The ten gallon tank had sand as substrate that was a pain to clean so I decided to get a more coarse gravel. I had an aqueon 10 quiet flow filter, the new tank came with the same filter but bigger (rated for up to 30 gallons). Because I removed the original sand I figured it would be smart to run both the new and old filter because of all the bacteria in the old one. I moved all the decorations to the new tank. I took out about 7-8 gallons from the 10 gallon tank to put into the 29 gallon, the rest of the water got too gross from moving stuff, and I filled it the rest of the way up. I slowly moved the fish over from the 10 to the 29, making sure to properly acclimated them first. Now today some of my fish seem “out of it” my red tail shark is very resilient and seems totally fine, but my sword tails are all in the top left corner of the tank hiding near the filter. Is this normal for the circumstances? Is it ok that I moved the fish over in this manor? "
1381,My cat is acting strange,"My cat is almost a year old. I got her when she was just between six and seven weeks old. She has been the perfect cat.  She loves me to pieces and she is great with the kids.   We moved about two and a half months ago and about a month ago she started to show some, I'm not sure if I should call it aggression, it seems like she's scared all of a sudden. She has been jumpy lately as well.    She is still very social and wants to be held all the time but silly things seem to scare her now. Even me setting my phone down next to her if she's not totally paying attention and she's laying in my lap will scare her.   I feel like it's not me because she always wants to be around me and cuddle and have her belly rubbed. Just randomly she will freak out and scratch me for no apparent reason. She can be in the other room doing her own thing and she will just run in here to scratch me and then run away.  I don't know if it's the move or what it is.    Just now she was in the living room looking out the sliding glass door, she started to walk this way and out of the blue she got spooked and scratched me. My arm was dripping blood. Any ideas?    Could this be just adjusting to a new home? Did something happen that I just haven't noticed? I love my cat to pieces but if she starts scratching the kids like this I don't know if she will be able to stay. My arms and legs are covered in scratches.     "
1382,Can I treat cat dandruff at home?,"Two of my four cats (the two elder) have recently developed TERRIBLE horrific dandruff. Since it developed at about the same time as the cold weather and increased use of home heating, I believe their skin is dry because it's winter and the air is drier.  Can I treat this at home? On my own skin I would apply lotion, but that doesn't work on cat skin. How can I increase the moisture on their skin? "
1383,Any serious studies of pets and music?,"It's always hard to tell whether a pet actually notices music as something different from less-organized noises, outside of the occasional dog which demonstrates that it can howl in harmony or the parrots which seem to spontaneously (?) dance in rhythm to a tune.  I find myself wondering whether anyone has tried doing brain-activity scans to see whether the same general brain centers light up in other animals as in humans when they hear music, and how that varies depending on species, musical style, and individuals. Music is a mental game of making/breaking predictions, and brains are marvelous pattern-detectors; the question would be how many minds are tuned how well for this kind of pattern and whether they enjoy it in the same way we do.  (Some cats I've known will come into the room when I turn the stereo on, but that may just be because this signals that I'm likely to be sitting still for an extended period and am probably willing to cuddle. I know turning on the living room lamp, which produces a bit of a hum, has the latter effect. Hence the desire to find out what those fuzzy little minds are actually doing.)  Does anyone here know whether such a study has been attempted, and if so where results were posted or what the results were? "

1386,My dog ate a chicken bone 2 years ago,"I might be a little bit paranoid about this, but I can't forget the time when my dog once ate a chicken bone. It happened 2 years ago, and I didn't know that it was dangerous so I gave it to him. There were no symptoms of chocking or discomfort in him. He was normal as usual. Already 2 years have passed, but I am still worried. Is it sure that he is totally fine?  But I'm still not sure if 'that' incident has affected him or not. And because of it, I am not sure if he is okay or if he has stomach pains until now. He seems normal.   Another concern is that he only consumes 1.5 cups to 2 cups of dry dog food and drinks about 2 cups of water a day. Is this normal? If it's not, is it because of that past incident?   What if he is still bleeding internally or having pains and I don't know it? I don't see any abnormalities in his daily life, but we never know....they can't tell us :(  I'm just really worried....the memory of 2years ago haunts me :(  *  Some info about my dog:   Breed : Korean Jindo  Age : 2 years and 7 months old  Gender: Male  Weight : 15 kg "
1387,My dog lies down on its stomach with legs wide open,Is it normal that when my dog lies down on its stomach it keeps legs wide open? I mean is this a good behavior?

1388,Is my cat's new toy making him agressive towards me?,"About two months back I bought my cat a wand toy, with a cloth heart filled with crinkling plastic and catnip at the end. He doesn't care much for his other toys unless I spray them with catnip, then he will roll about with them and drool all over. Great, but that won't get him running about, hence I figured the wand toy would be great as he won't figure out (and still hasn't) that it is me dragging it about.  The toy is a great success, but sadly a bit too much. In the morning when I get up I feed him his wet food, then I sit down to work. I'll have maybe an hour or so before he jumps on my desk and demands attention. He will run all over and press his head against me to rub his scent. This has never been a problem until around when I got the toy. He'd normally get petted a bit and be content and lay down to let me work. Now instead he puts his ears back, meows loudly at me in an upset manner, and starts biting or clawing at my hands and face. When I get up to raise my height above his, he will run off to the kitchen where the toy is kept.   In the past I gave in and played with him, but I've come to realize I may be reinforcing the behaviour and would like to try and correct it. At present when he claws or bites I pick him up and put him on the floor. He will however defiantly jump back up and get more hostile. So then I pick him up and put him in the hallway and close the door. He will loudly protest and hit at the door (running his paws over it, but without claws thank goodness). I leave him until he is calm again, then I open the door. Sometimes he will behave then, but other times he will come and start the whole thing up again.   I should note also that since he got the new toy, he no longer wants his other toys sprayed with catnip. He will actively ignore them but indicate he wants to play. I have a laser pointer also but he has also figured that out, and seems frustrated he can't really catch the dot. The only other toy he likes is a ball with a hole that drops treats when knocked about. He only gets that every few days though as I don't want him to gain too much weight. Also, I live in an apartment, so I need to help him be active. His other favourite activities are watching birds or people from his cat trees, he has one at the front that overlooks the street, and one in the back that overlooks the gardens.   My question is what could I do to fix this situation? Should I keep putting him in the hallway if he is mean and only play with him when he is nice? Or would it be better if I pro-actively played with him as soon as he's gotten his breakfast, or even before?    Edit: Forgot to say that I've gotten Feliway about a week and a half ago, but so far I've not seen any behaviour changes. Not sure if it needs more time to work or it simply doesn't affect my cat. "
1389,Dog Training - Nothing in Life is Free Punishment Confusion,"Our family adopted an 11 month old Coonhound 2 weeks ago and have decided to use the Nothing In Life Is Free training approach.  For basic things (such as making him sit before we let him out or ignoring his barking before giving him food)  this program seems to be both intuitive and effective.  For more complicated things, like when punishment is required for play biting or chewing, things in general that do demand our immediate attention, this program is not so intuitive.  One of the core tenets of this program, as I understand it, seems to be that you never allow your dog to demand attention from you.  (For instance - this seems to be a common trend: ""Attention seeking behaviors don’t work.  Some dogs become quite pushy about attention, demanding that you pet him by pawing, nudging and/or barking.  Ignore attention seeking behavior rather then pushing your dog away or scolding him. - [website]In a recent situation, we took him on an hour long walk, and as soon as we got home he started attacking the Christmas Tree.  If we're not supposed to allow our dog to demand attention from us, what is the appropriate way to curb this behavior?  In another recent situation, he jumped on the couch without us inviting him up and tried to walk all over us.  It seems like the NILIF program says that he can't be up on the couch unless he's invited, but it also says that we should ignore attention seeking behavior.  It seems to me that there's a direct conflict here and I'm not entirely sure how to proceed.  Basically what I'm wondering is, it seems like there are inconsistencies in the guidelines for the NILIF program.  What is the correct way to handle punishment for bad behavior, or is simply ignoring the bad behavior the actual solution?    Currently, for things such as biting or chewing, I have been following the advice I grew up with and either holding his mouth open or holding his mouth shut. I'm not entirely sure what the correct response is for other bad behaviors.   *On a side note, this dog is 11 months old and was crated for almost the first 9 months of his life.  He understands Sit and Down - he will follow a verbal Sit command but not a verbal Down command (we have to use the hand motion).  I believe this is a good program to follow, if it is not please let me know.  From everything we've been told by the Vet and have read online, the positive-reinforcement only training is not good for him. "
1390,Feeding raw meat to kittens,"There is this mommy cat and a young one wandering around our neighborhood. Today I just shredded some beef, cut the remaining in to small chunks and gave it to the kitten. I heated it in the microwave and made it warm enough so that he could digest it properly. He ate about three quarters of it and immediately started shivering (around the tummy area) and made burping-like noises. He kept on eating, but I removed the food and he was so very sad...  Now, after about two hours, the fella looks relaxed. I kept checking up on him every 30 minutes. I don't know his age, but his mom is still with him. Does it mean he is still being breastfed? Can I continue feeding him? I am completely inexperienced when it comes to pets. He is about 15-20 cms long excluding the tail. I did it thinking it would be good for him, but now I feel terrible! There are some unhealthy source of food for both of them all around the area - trash cans, kitchen wastes and so on. Some other neighbors might be feeding them too. If it would help your answer, I could post a picture of the kitty. "

1392,My Danio Fish is Hiding,"Yesterday I adopted 3 fish. I adopted 1 Danio Fish and 2 Danio GloFish for my 3 gallon (11 litres) tank.    My 2 GloFish are as happy as can be in their new home, but I'm concerned about my normal Danio. To make things easy his name is Streek. He likes to hide behind my filter and sometimes next to the airstone in my tank.    Yesterday, he was laying on the gravel and we thought he might be sick. But this morning he was fine and he is fine now. He was playing out in the open earlier but it seems in the evening he hides and what I'm guessing sleeps. During the day like I said he act likes he did before the people at the store took him out of his tank along with the other two.    The GloFish are not aggressive. They come around Streek and try to get him to play with some luck depending on his mood. Each fish is tiny and young. And they have tons of space to play and swim.  Is my Danio supposed to act like this? Should I get him a buddy like him? Is he still getting used to his home?  PS: There are plants for him to hide in as well as a lighted LED AirStone. "

1396,Why does my cat pee on the rug outside the toilet?,"I have a cat which was a stray cat 10 years ago. No pee tray or litter tray was provided as she knows how to do her business in the toilet without any training from the 1st day.  However, the problem is in the recent years my cat started peeing on the rug/carpet outside the toilet even the toilet is dry. The urine will seep through the carpet and wet the floor, eventually flowing all around the area which makes the whole kitchen very smelly. Occasionally she will even spray urine onto the refrigerator or on the carpet beside the refrigerator.  I found that these post are quite similar for my problem in some way:  What are scents which cats do not like?  Why does my cat go to the toilet at the same time as I do?     There are three things that I could not figure out why:         She loves to pee on the carpet outside the toilet when there is nobody around, even though the toilet is dry (my cat seems to be a good actor; she will always pee in the toilet when she knows that I am home, but ignores my mother or grandmother even when they caught her in the act; she seems to only care when I am around.)   She loves to seek my attention when I am home, and ""bring"" me to the toilet to ""over-see"" to prove to me that she did go to the toilet.   Why does she only pee on the carpet but will 100% poop in the toilet even when the floor of the toilet is dry.      The only reason I could think of is that my cat loves me more than other family members as I am the one who took her in, takes care of most of her stuff, and hug her like a child every night before I go to bed. I will praise her everytime she goes to the toilet. Therefore she ""respects"" me and wants to prove to me that she a good cat doing her business in the toilet.  What could possibly be the actual reasons? Is there any ways that I could correct her? "
1397,"Why is there no such thing as a ""Saltwater Dip""?","A freshwater dip is common practice to treat many parasites as well as a precaution before introducing new fish (especially wild caught).  What's a freshwater dip? Most marine fish prefer a salinity in the neighborhood of 1.024 ppm.  Smaller organisms are more sensitive to this requirement, especially sudden fluctuations; so we take freshwater that has similar parameters in every other regard (namely temperature and pH) and submerse the fish in it for a few minutes.  It's harmless to the fish but the other organisms cannot tolerate the hyposalinity.  My Question If this parameter shock is a viable method for treating marine fish, why is this not the case for freshwater? "
1398,How can I reduce my need to do a water change on my turtle's habitat?,"Hello turtles masters :)  I have 20cm (shield) turtle in 70L of water in aquarium.

I don't wanna change water every week. I have read some articles in which people  change water every second week, but some of them change it only once a year.  Question: Is there something I can do in order to keep from doing water changes every week?  I'm wondering if I should be using a different filter or caring for it differently? Would adding any natural ""filters"" like plants or even fish (which could not be eaten by my turtle) help? "

1400,Remove fish when cleaning gravel?,"How do I clean the gravel at the bottom?  Stirring the bottom with gravel vac raises clouds of gunk, so I wonder if its better to remove fish while cleaning or leave them in place.  I am a newbie, have a 3 week-old fish tank (5gal Fluval Edge) with four neon tetras.  They only eat food as its falling -- not from the surface, not once it touches the bottom.  Plus it took a while for them to start eating.  So some food particles have accumulated within blue gravel at bottom, as well as other gunk.

I have been using this as the default variety, interspersed with the other flavors.  However, my cat has recently started refusing to eat the indoor variety, though she still eats the others.  Why might this change have occurred?  Is there any way I can convince her to accept the indoor variety again?  Note: I noticed that she had thrown up one morning a couple of weeks ago. Could she be associating this negative experience with the particular flavor of cat food? "

I was looking to purchase some 'Californian' species of rabbits, are they more adapted to these dry &amp; heat conditions of my area?

1404,Can my cat have yogurt?,"According to 15 Foods to avoid, it states that diary products should not be allow for cats and dogs. However, has an exception for plain yogurt and cottage cheese.    I used to give my cat the leftover yogurt on the surface of the cup (not plain, eg. Aloe Vera yogurt), and she enjoyed it. This is to give her some probiotic for digestion as she's getting old. Sometimes she will get soft stool the next day, but did not vomit. I thought this will be good since she tend to have very  hard stool. Does this mean that it is safe for cats to digest minimial amount of such yogurt? Is it harmful to them in any way?? "
1405,How to punish an aggressive misbehaving puppy?,"My parents adopted a puppy(Nora) a month ago, she's about 3 months old now. I'm having trouble disciplining her when she misbehaves.  She is not getting along with our other pets. By that I mean that she almost constantly bothers them. She bites and jumps at our older dog, she runs after our cats and grab them. The other dog pretends to viciously bite her, but pretending is all he can do, so he usually ends up barking and whining for help. Our adult cat doesn't hesitate to slap her if she comes too close, she even scratched the puppy once. But Nora doesn't seem to get any of the message and keeps bothering them.  When she does this I'd usually tell her ""no"", if the behaviour continues I raise my voice and if she continues, which happens quite often, I would punish her by putting her alone in a room for a little time.   The problem is : how can I do that when she runs away from me? She basically just stay out of my reach and carry on her misbehavior if possible! And if I manage to catch her, she tries to get out of my grip by vigorously contorting, rolling on the floor and trying to bite me! How can I handle this? She's so agitated I'm afraid that she'd bite my face if I try to carry her.  I am more of a cat person so I know that I may be biased. But I find her far too rough to the other pets. I live in fear that she may hurt my kittens. I'm worried that the adult cat may hurt her for good as well.  My father is home all day long but he is quite passive and I know that he doesn't do anything to actually raise/train her. So it's basically up to me and my mother to do this. Needless to say, coming home after a long day of work to a disobeying puppy leaves us with very little patience.  Honestly, if things don't get better, I consider suggesting that we get rid of her. But I would rather avoid this. I have a long record of taking in abandonned cats and I don't feel like doing this to Nora. "

1407,my cats won't play together (not neutered or spayed),"I have a 1 year old female cat who as a kitten up until now used to play with me as if I am another cat, she runs, and I'll have to follow her then its her turn to chase. I do that because she's been my only cat and we couldn't bring her another cat to play with until now. The point is she is only used to playing with people as animals but not real animals. When she was younger we brought her two kittens to play with she used to chase them and run away from them as play but whenever they tried to touch her she hisses. We unfortunately had to give the two kittens to a friend for a particular reason. So sense that time she didn't have an animal friend to spend time with.I felt she wasn't having her fair play so I decided to get another cat for her to play with.  It is a 7 month old male. I thought it was OK if he is younger hence his body size is bigger than her. Now she tolerates him since they both know she's the boss. But whenever he tries to PLAY with her she hits him, and runs after him, sometimes hissing, sometimes she backs off and leaves him alone. And sometimes I hear him screaming and she's attacking him so I get my water spray and shoot her and that's when the fight is over.  I'd like to say that their is no rolling around she is just hitting him with her paw and he starts screaming and that's when I think he's just doing that so I would come stop her. They both love playing with us. but they almost never play together.  I'd like to remind that both cats are tolerant to each others presence but they don't play together. So how do i make them play together?  But as i mentioned maybe in an unclear way that Joury had previous experience with cat's (the two kittens i mentioned up).But the two kittens were not coward so i think thats why she played with them. Silver tries to play with Joury alot. But it's always he runs when she is about to do an act or when he gets too close she either hits him or gives him a glare. I could notice that she sometimes wants to kinda play with him but whenever she shows him she's about to move he runs from fear. It's like they both want to play together sometimes but it's always she gets some kind of ego in the last second and doesn't except him or he feels afraid for no reason so she hits him. What do you suggest i do? "
1408,Fungus blocking fish from eliminating,"I recently acquired fungus in one of my tanks (from what I can tell I can see 3 fish with signs of it and one who has it the worst). I took the three and put them in a hospital tank to try to contain spreading, but am treating both. The worst of the three has a ring of the fungus around his gut right where most females have the gravid spot. He is still eating and eliminating, BUT instead of his poo being able to drag behind him and fall off it's stuck in the fungus and is wrapping around his body as it grows. I'm concerned with this happening he will lose the ability to eliminate, and stop eating or die from it (if the fungal infection doesn't kill him). I've seen people pick up larger fish with non latex gloves, for wound care and breeding purposes, but I try my best to put my hands in the tanks as little as possible, and never intend to  touch any of my fish. I am wondering if I can use my hands to rub part of the fuzzy off?  Ive treated sick fish for people over the years, wether it be my own, at a pet store, or friends and  haven't experienced THIS as a specific issue. I know this sounds like a strange or stupid question for most people, but I want his healing to be as smooth as possible and increase his chances of living. It's only been 24 hours since I started treatment, and was hoping to see enough improvement that he could poo like a normal fish. I added a different texture of plant to the hospital tank to encourage him to rub against and aquarium salt for general, Gill and fin health. If I can't rub some off, are there any additional recommendations?  "
1409,Whats the best way to prevent cats from going places they shouldn't?,"We have 2 kittens that we brought home 5 days ago, they are 12 and 13 weeks old now. They have a very tall cat tree that they use, they use the litterbox and they get along very well.  There are certain things we don't want them to do, such as:   Jumping on the dinner table and kitchen counters. Playing with/eating the (fake) plants. Jumping on the towel shelf (it's in the bathroom, next to the litterbox, don't want their dirty paws on my towels). Climbing the curtains.   I am sure they do this because they think it's fun, not because they lack attention; I work from home and I try to pet them every half hour.  I have tried the following:   Ignoring them completely when they do the above. Removing them while saying a firm ""NO"" and then walking away. They keep going right back at it and I come back, rinse and repeat. Sticking double-sided tape on the plant pots, they just ripped it off and started playing with it, then tried to eat it, and then right back to bashing the leaves.   Next thing I want to try is to use a tiny water gun that I can conceal in my hand and squirt them, then act like I didn't even notice they are there so they don't associate the water with me.  I heard that clicker training is the best way to train your cat to do what you want, but how does that work if you just want to train them to NOT do what you DON'T want?  I'm afraid that having picked them up and removed them while saying a firm ""NO"" might have damaged the bond between us and the kittens. In the first 2 days they would sit with us in the couch, now they don't want to and just sleep in their cat tree.  What's the best way to stop unwanted behavior while building/maintaining a bond with the kittens? "
1410,Is it OK to adopt unknown breeds?,"I thank you all in advance for your answers. I am a dog-lover and I'm going to adopt my first dog in a few weeks (I couldn't do so before because of lack of time and space) Now I'm wondering if is it OK to adopt a pup from farmers who live in villages and their dogs are clearly from no specific breeds and their parents have been herding shepherd dogs in our local environment? (Western Iran) I want to bring the dog to a small (60-70 SqM) apartment. My main concern is the behavior. Can they be trained like a purebred? (Labs, Goldens, Border Collies, Aussies,...) "
1411,activated charcoal filters + fan for covered litter box?,"A couple of weeks ago I finally adopted two cats (both 2yo, from different shelters). One of the two does not cover his poop, probably because he never learned to, and it's too late to teach him now. The other cat actually does double duty if he finds uncovered poop in the litter box, covering (so to speak) for his roommate. Anyway, the stuff stinks really badly, and the exhaust fan in my inside bathroom does not do an adequate job of clearing up the air.  I have one of those covered litter boxes (the Van Ness CP7), and it already has vents on the top (with zeolite filters that don't do anything), so I'm thinking of attaching some sort of fan that would pull the air and force it through an activated charcoal filter. Does such a thing already exist? I haven't been able to find anything on Amazon. I've looked at lots of small air purifiers, and none appear to be suitable for fitting on top of the box.   Suggestions? Pointers?   I also assume the carts won't like it if there is a whirring fan and air movement while they do their business, so a PIR sensor and a relay connected to an Arduino would take care of that. Plus, it would get me statistics for how much and how long they use the box for while I'm away :) ). "
1412,Is it OK to wash my dogs head/face with the hose and dog shampoo?,I feel like I have read that it's a bad choice to wash your dogs head and face because you could get water in their ears and irritate their eyes. What are some options I can try that would avoid these negative things but still allow me to get my dog fully clean? Are there different shampoo choices for a dogs head/face that would be better to use than those for a dogs body? I have a 65 lb. Labrador Retriever. 
1413,Can a DOG learn to cover it's feces?,"I'm wondering what other ways can we teach a dog to deal with it's feces. Can dogs learn to cover their feces? Is it even natural for them? And why don't usual dogs cover their feces? Is it a territory thing? Are they not afraid of bigger animals to find them, or is it just that they don't care or think it doesn't make a reason for other animals to come look for them?  It would be really great if someone is able to explain to me the whole thing, because a friend of mine is thinking of adopting a puppy but she's afraid the dog would dirty up her home which can make family problems for her. She is thinking of having a sand box in her yard and let the dog do it's buisiness in there like a CAT. "
1414,Does my cat have a boyfriend?,"So I just walked downstairs to find my black cat chilling out on the table with a ginger cat in the room, with no issues whatsoever. The cat is called Peter and owned by someone who lives nearby. This isn't the first time I've found Peter in my house, he's been lying on the sofa before as well as eating from the food in my house, when he did that I shouted ""Shoo, Peter, shoo! Run while you can!"" and he shot right out.  I'm a bit confused as to why Peter is coming into my house and my cat isn't showing hostility to him. I am now convinced that they are in deep love with each other. Luckily my cat is neutered. Maybe my cat is inviting Peter round to play or to eat breakfast with her, I have no idea, and I hope I can figure out if she's inviting Peter to our house.  In fact, lately Peter has been coming round every day.  I don't take very kindly to Peter because I don't know if he's coming in without my cat's permission or with my cat's permission. I don't care if he's in my house, I doubt he'll do much harm but I just want to know... why.... there's loads of other people who live near me who have cats who he could visit.   Is my cat friends with Peter? Why is Peter visiting me?   I believe that my cat is going out with Peter. I'm not entirely sure, but I can just guess it...  "
1415,Cat Squinting Left Eye,"My cat hasn't changed it's behaviour at all but is squinting his left eye. He has done this before and it was just some sort of thing that like 15% of cats get. They gave him eye drops and he was fine. Now he is squinting again and his left eye is watering quite a bit. Should I take him to the vet? We have some eye drops from last time. Should I use those?  For those of you who wanted to know, he has now healed up. It was just a simple infection. Thats why I was hesitant to bother the vet, because we had some eye drops from when he had that last time. Thanks for the help. "
1416,Should I put a collar on my indoor cat,"I have a very strictly indoor cat, that has tried to dart outside a couple of times and sometimes succeeded, only making it to the edge of our patio before we caught him. My absolute worst nightmare is him getting lost. We have him microchipped and stamped. Should we have an ID tag on a collar for him too? If so, how can I get him warmed up to the idea of having a collar?  I am also going to add that he has been neutered "
1417,To Foster or Not to Foster?,"I have one very territorial cat, named Butterscotch. (Male, Neutered, 6 human years old, Ginger Tabby.) I have a friend who fosters animals, and I am very jealous of the adorable kittens he recently had. (I am happy to say that they found homes very fast.) I would love to foster animals but I don't think my cat would like that to much. Is there some way I can still do this without my cat being bothered? I don't have any extra space in my house to have a foster room, and there is definatly no place in the house where my cat doesn't have a ""special place."" If there is no way of doing this, how can I get involved with a no-kill shelter? (which my home city lacks.) I don't want to get a full time job, just help with some no-kill cat care. Is there any other ways I can get involved with cat-related work? "
1418,How to train a dog to properly cross a road?,"Reading several articles on guide dogs for the blind I often found that, when it comes to the road crossing bit, they say that the dogs are not trained to pay attention to the crossing lights or the beeper some crossings are equipped with, they rather look at the changes in traffic movement. Anyone knows how do they train the dogs to ""look for cars"" before crossing?    Edit: I'm aware that there is a command given by the handler but my question is about how they get taught to evaluate the traffic after the command is given. This is an example of the various things I read (from guidedogsofamerica FAQ page):     Q: I heard that dogs are color blind, so how do they know when the   light turns green so they can cross the street?      A: Guide Dogs do not read the lights nor make the decision to cross   the street. It is the guide dog user that gives the command to go   forward. First the guide dog user listens for the traffic. When the   guide dog user determines it is safe to go forward, they give the   command and cross the street. If the guide dog determines it is unsafe   to cross the street when it is given the command, it will   “intelligently disobey”. This might happen if the guide dog user   misjudges the traffic or if a motorist suddenly comes around a corner   speeding. In many cases, guide dogs have saved lives because they have   protected their partners from dangerous situations involving unsafe   motor vehicles.  "
1419,What Are Some Ways to Increase Space for Cats in a Small House?,"I have a fairly small house (Ok, it's really small) Not an apartment but still very small. I also have a cat, who loves exploring every bit of my small house. He loves the basement.   The basement is unfinished, so it has a lot of stuff just laying around until I can put things on shelves. The shelves, however, are also just laying around, they also have things on them.   Important things: As you may have already noticed, this is a recipe for disaster. Cat jumps on a shelf, important breakable stuff falls down, breakable stuff breaks. This makes the cat happy, but me... Not so much.   My cat has loads of things to lay on upstairs, including a large cat post positioned in front of the living room windows, an arsenal of cardboard boxes strategically placed on shelves and desks, and couches, and chairs, and beds. However, downstairs is a cat paradise.   Shelves and other in abstract positions, loads of raised up (and unsafe now blocked off) places to lay, and of course... Drum roll please... The nice warm vibrating top of our front load dryer.   The only problem with this is that he has only the small upstairs to adventure in when contractors are here. (which is quite frequent as I am trying to get my basement finished.) I don't want my cat going downstairs while, or even after, the contractors are here.   The reason I don't want him going down after the contractors are here is because there is loads of wood, power tools, boxes of nails, screws, other sharp and dangerous miscellaneous items... Or, at least, there is until I clean the basement.   We all know the saying, curiosity killed the cat. How do I increase the space he has upstairs so he doesn't want to go downstairs to sleep and play?   Am I coming at it from the right direction, or is there some other way I should be handling this problem?   Either way, I would like him to have more space upstairs, because even with the cat post and cardboard boxes, he still doesn't really have much. I don't really want to pay to much money on this, as I need some money for finishing my basement too. What are some ways of doing this? I want a good long-term solution.   Also, I forgot to mention, my cat is a little overweight, so whatever it is, it needs to be sturdy! Thanks for the help, sorry if I wrote too much. "
1420,How to Train my Easily Distracted Cat,"My cute little fur ball, (Butterscotch.) is quite food motivated, and I would like to train him to do cool things like roll over and shake a paw. He has a very sensitive stomach (As you may already know.) and I can only feed him about 5-6 treats a day, sometimes more if i'm lucky. I have heard of clicker training, but have absolutely no clue how to do it. I also don't know if that would even work for him. Does anyone know of a good way to train him? Also, does anyone know of some really epic tricks I could teach him? Even things such as: Going to a certain location when asked; Coming when called by name; Grabbing something for you; playing dead; I would really like to teach him to do these things and if someone knows of another great trick, let me know! I would love to teach him all the tricks I can! "
1421,Feline Leukemia question,"Just curious about this illness. I was looking at adoptable cats at a local shelter, and more cats have Felv than don't.  Is this an epidemic? Why do so many cats have this illness and is it getting worse? "
1422,"My turtle fell from fifth floor, almost 40 ft","  I kept it at the window side for basking and it jumped off. When I went down it was walking, but was bleeding near the mouth. Now, I keep it in water and it looks like bleeding has stopped. It is moving normally, no cracks are visible in the shell (hoping there is no crack), but it's not taking food or opening its mouth. Is there anything to worry about; any internal injury or jaw fracture? I am posting the pics from when it was bleeding, and afterwards when keeping it in water. Is it safe to keep it in water or should I keep it dry to prevent infection? It's one year old, no vets nearby. "
1423,How to choose the right size of mice for my snakes?,Currently my black headed python is eating 3 medium mice once every 10 days. If he is eating 3 with ease should I upgrade the size of his mice?   I also have 2 hatchling jungles that are currently eating 2 fuzzy mice. Should I also upgrade their mice or just keep them on what they are eating for a while longer?   How do I know when it is time to give larger mice to my snake? 
1424,Transport a cockatiel locally in car ride,"Any suggestions for how to transport a cockatiel bird across a city in a car ride? The bird will occasionally relocate from one home to another every few months.   If we had a bird cage already established in each home, how could we easily move the bird back and forth? Any suggestion for an inexpensive compact simple container to get the bird from cage to car to other cage?  Also tips for coaxing/moving the bird between cage and container would be good. This bird is tame enough to enjoy a thorough neck massage between a pair of fingers, but is not otherwise trained. "
1425,How should I build a Cat Tree?,I would like to upgrade my small cat tree. I have a slightly overweight tabby cat. It needs to be sturdy and have lots of places to sleep perch and play. I would like to know if cats are affected by certain materials. Such as: Scented wood like Cedar; Certain carpet types; Other. What sort of toys should I build into it? Is there some that are better for my cat? Is it a good idea to incorporate corrugated cardboard as well as carpet? Should I have closed in parts or just perches? How can I make it look half decent and not like a chunk of wood covered in cardboard? Is there any ideas (or pictures) of really unique homemade cat houses? Can I make a nice one that doesn't cost over [tex]600?  
1426,Is it possible to have a pet cat even with cat allergies?,"My wife and I would like to adopt two kittens, however she has cat allergies and currently would not be able to live with them. The adoption group let us foster (with the plan for adoption) a pair of shorthair tabbys that she has fallen in love with. We would like to keep them, but think it is a bad decision.  We don't want to take the kittens, and have her live with the allergies, and we don't want to try something that only works for a short period of time. So is there something we can do to keep the kittens without having my wife live with allergic reactions all the time?  So far we have employed other strategies to help with the issue, like dusting often and keeping them out of the bedroom, but we are looking for a more permanent solution.  From reading online it seems like immunotherapy is an option to help treat those allergies so she would be able to live with them. I am hoping for some kind of treatment like this, but I don't know how effective that is, or if it would even help. What are my options? "
1427,May I bring my dog's body home when he dies of canine distemper?,"I was told by my vet that I couldn't bring my dog's body home with me, after he had been put to sleep for being in a terminal stage of canine distemper.  They told be that he could still infect other animals? Is that true? Is it reasonable to not allow you to give your dog a proper funeral in this case? "
1428,Should I allow one cat eating the other cat's vomit?,"Sometimes one of my cats vomits after eating something she really likes. Both my cats like the Whiskas food but they only get a little bit once per day. I suspect she's just eating too fast and that makes her throw up.  What happens when she vomits is that her brother comes running and starts to eat her thrown up food from the floor. Apart from the fact that it is practical for myself as I don't have to clean up the mess, should I allow one cat to eat the vomit of the other one? Is it healty?  To the best of my knowledge she is not ill, she's been vomiting sometimes since I know her, and especially when eating very quickly.   "
1429,How can I keep a very small tank well oxygenated?,"First of all, I didn't have any experience on fish keeping before. But my child really wanted to have some fish, so I bought a small (0.5 gallon) fish tank.  I got him two guppies and two gold fish. But the gold fish died two days after I put them into the tank. I did some research online, and people said I have to change the water to keep it clean and maintain enough oxygen. I usually put some tap water in another tank, and keep it for 3 days, and every time I change half of the old water I clean the tank thoroughly. But every time after I change the water, it becomes dirty again soon after, and the fish swim on the top slowly, just like they're lacking oxygen.  I put some salt into the tank, seems help a bit, but not much. I don't know what to do. Do you think I need to use a pump to pump air into the tank? Will any pump fit that small of a tank? Do you think putting some sea weed will help? If so, what kind of sea weed should I put? "
1430,"My tap water is contaminated by the chemical (MCHM) leak, what do I use for water changes?","I'm in the 'Do Not Use' zone of West Virginia, so I'm affected by the MCHM CHEMICAL Leak and need to do a partial water change on a freshwater tank. Some of my fish are 16+ years old,  and I don't want to lose them.  Since I cannot use water from the sink, would it be better to use bottled drinking water or distilled water? Besides adjusting the ph and temp, should I do anything else to help fix this? "
1431,Should I regularly feed my cat catnip?,"I have a cat who, like most other cats, really loves catnip. She becomes (joyfully) delusional  and keeps rolling on the ground. Most of the time she would swallow the herb. While I enjoy watching the little show she puts on after catnip consumption, I am a bit worried about the possibility of side effects.  Is there any health benefit associated with consuming catnip? Is there any harm that catnip could potentially do to cats (At some point my cat was so high that I started worrying if she would die of heart attack...)? What would be an appropriate amount of consumption? Could the herb be addictive? "
1432,What is the science that makes beet greens a good choice for a rabbit with renal issues?,"My bunny was diagnosed with renal issues last night. In part he has an elevated BUN.  The vet suggested adding beet greens, beet pulp or dandelion greens to his diet to help absorb some of the nitrogen. What is the science behind this chemical reaction?  Are there other sources of what ever the good stuff is in battling the high nitrogen?  "
1433,Microchip Registry questions,"My dog got her microchip implanted in Korea.   When we moved back to the US, I was told by a vet that I have to do the registering myself online. So I did. I used petlink.net, but it seems like they require payment to complete it. So the first question is: do I need to make payment to complete it?   I also found a different free registry site: [website]As the name of the service suggests, I registered for free, however, because I'm using a free service, I'm afraid it might somehow be lacking in one way or another compared to premium services. Would that be the case?   Do I need to register the chip in multiple services to improve my chance of finding her when lost? What's the process like?   All in all, my question revolves around what the process is like when my dog is found, and what I can do to improve my chance of recovering her.   Thank you so much all you wonderful souls for answering my questions! "
1434,Training or Protection?,"Critical ages for puppies  So after reading many sites, it seems that at the 8-16 week period for a puppy, it is ideal to enroll them into training classes and socialize them, however; vaccination for Parvo starts at 8 weeks and isn't completed until they reach around  16 weeks.  Question  So I would think that most of the puppies enrolled would not have completed their vaccination period? Would it be better to enroll and have them socialize or to keep them safe and not risk Parvo?  Also FYI our puppy is 10 weeks old right now. "
1435,Plants for a brackish water tank?,"Anyone know some plant salt resistant for this type of tank? I need a some reference cause this tank have a bit percentage of salinity in the wate, is lower percentatge but this can harm the plants.   What plants can i use here? "
1436,Pressure change when flying with cats,Next month I will be flying my cats across the country and taking them as cabin luggage.  My vet has supplied suitable drugs for keeping them relaxed during the trip (although I think that I should be the one talking them!)  On a flight I was on last week there was a baby 3 rows away and said baby was crying during take off and landing as it was probably experiencing inner ear discomfort due to the pressure change.  My question is do cats suffer from the same sort inner ear problems that humans have when flying? (and is there anything I can actually do about it?) 
1437,13 week old kitten will not stop sucking on me,"I have a 13 week old kitten, which I took away from her mama when she was 9 weeks old. She stopped nursing from her mom and started sucking on my ear lobes and neck (and sometimes the tip of my fingers). She is definitely a healthy happy kitty! She only does this when she's ready to go to sleep. I feel like I can't bond with her because I'm constantly setting her down on the floor or pushing her off my earlobes. It's like I give the Tabby more attention than I give her. (She's a Calico.) Is this normal? Will she eventually stop, or do I need to double check on her health? I don't think shes stressed, she will only fight me when she's being put down. Until I give her something to suck on, she wins every time.... How do I get her to stop sucking on me? "
1438,Which home made foods/meals can dog eat?,"I don't want to buy packaged dog foods. What meals i can offer for him? E.g spaghetti, bread, milk? I mean not specially prepared food but foods that human eats. "
1439,"One cat licks the other, but hates being licked","I have two 3-year-old cats. They are siblings (same litter), one female, one male. They get along reasonably well, with the occasional boxing and hissing match but nothing too serious (see my previous questions for examples), but also playing and sleeping next to each other in adorable positions on occasion.  Curiously, the female will lick the male (especially on the head, which is harder for him to clean himself) quite often (maybe a couple of times a day) and he enjoys it just fine. In fact, he'll often then try to lick her in return.  Thing is, she hates it when he does that. He can't lick her for two seconds before getting boxed in the face.  I've read that there is a hierarchy to licking, with the most senior cat usually starting the licking party. However, that article also states that the cat may do that with the expectation of getting licked back.  For the record, my wife and I are unsure of who's the more senior of our two cats. The male is significantly larger, so he's got a clear advantage on the physical aspect, but we also think the female is in the running (though I'm having trouble putting into words why). We usually conclude that they're actually competing for the role to this day.  So, is there anything to read into the female's behavior? Or is it probably just a personality thing (she's just not that into being licked)? "
1440,Kittens Playing or Fighting,"I have some 12 week old kittens that just met. We kept them separate for a couple days so that they could play with each other under the door, then we propped the door open just a bit. They liked playing with each other through the door and did it a lot. We recently put them together, and their behavior is hard for me to categorize. I had cats when I was younger, but not recently, and I haven't seen cats meet (at least not much and not recently). Anyway, here are some behaviors:  Behaviors that make me think they're playing   No growling nor hissing Ears generally up and forward No tense standoffs No hair raised nor arched backs No injuries: no favouring of limbs, body parts, etc., no blood, no fur being removed, etc. They were able to stop playing at eat within a foot of each other without attacking again. One of them did growl quietly sometimes while eating, but they generally seemed amicable. Both cats engage in play; neither tries to run off and end the play session.   Behaviors that make me think they might be fighting   They never stop. It's obvious they're both really tired; they won't go for a toy at all, but any time they see each other, they go at it again. They don't allow each other breaks. There is a slightly bigger male, and he generally pins the other (the female has a defensive style and assumes a position on her back preemptively). But, any time the male walks away, the female comes and gets him from behind again. They do make a little noises. The female doesn't like when he bites her back legs, so she calls out (not loud, but in frustration it sounds like), and the male doesn't like being attacked from behind. They're pretty intense. It's not a slow, relaxed play session like I see on youtube: we let it go for two or 2.5 hours last night, and they nearly never let up.   The signals seem really confusing to me. It seems like whether they're being aggressive or playful, they need to take a break. The female was sick a couple weeks ago, so I would think she needs her rest. They slept very well last night! And we can't detect any injuries anywhere. In case it helps, they're ragdolls.  Any recommendations? Should we split them up seeking for an easier, calmer relationship after a while? "
1441,How to help a wild baby parrot who cannot fly?,"3 days ago a baby parrot was found in my garden, we are not sure from where this bird came from.  We soon discovered that he cannot fly, at this time we are trying to keep him safe from predators.   His flight feathers look to be cut with scissors, we entice him to fly but he doesn't.  I don't have much experience with pets. I'm looking for advice as to what we can do to help him thrive in the wild.  Should we visit a veterinarian for the clipped feathers?   I read they get back feathers, how much time does it take?  Edit: There was one more thing, may be leas important here. Next day one more baby parrot came to my home, we kept both of them together in open. This one stayed one day and night and flew away next morning.  Adding Image as requested in comments.    Here is picture of the other bird I was referring, you can compare and see this one has wings.   Edit2: Today parrot flew away, I am happy for him.  This is no more a question for me but answer will still help others. "
1442,"For an adult, housebroken dog, is it okay to not have a crate?","I am planning to adopt an adult dog that is already housebroken. Everything I read about crate training says that it is very helpful for house training puppies, but I can’t find anything about adult dogs who are already past that point.  Is it okay to not have a crate for adult, housebroken dogs? I’ve read about how dogs have an instinct to create a “den” and that a crate can satisfy that, so if I put their bedding in a secluded area to address that, do I need to bother with the expense and hassle of a crate? "
1443,My dog consistently wakes up about an hour before I do,"My two-year-old dog seems to only be able to hold her pee for about six hours, which is unfortunately less than the amount of sleep I need to get in a night. We'll potty her before we go to bed, but she'll still consistently wake up an hour or so before I do, no matter what time we go to bed. As in, I tried going to bed earlier and getting up earlier to take her out, but she only got up even earlier.  Now that she's been doing this for a little bit, she'll also start whining for her breakfast. I hate giving it to her because I know it's only training her to get up early and eat; but I also can't deal with her whining for a half hour while I'm trying to sleep.  How can we train her to be better at waiting for us to get up in the morning? For example, not giving her water after a certain time? I'm hesitant to try that on my own because I already worry we don't give her enough water.  Aside from this, she's otherwise house-trained pretty well. I don't think she's had a daytime accident for a few months now. "
1444,Aggression between desexed male rabbits,"My sister's housemate recently got two male desexed rabbits.  They claw and bite at each other, more so one on the other, to the point of bloody ears.

1447,Are dogs much less sensitive to high noise than humans?,"I must admit (a bit shamesly) that I was not aware of the fact that volume is on a logarithmic scale and thus following sentence (source) surprised me:     The back seats are closer to 87 dBA, which is good for transporting dogs. A Honda Accord at 70 mph subjects its occupants to around 65 dBA of noise, or about 1/30th the noise level of Cirrus.   However, what actually shocked me, is the last part of the first sentence:     which is good for transporting dogs   If we assume that:   a Honda Accord at 70 mph (65 dBA) is quite noisy (quite very noisy?), 22 dBA (87-65) difference is thirty times more (so quite very, very noisy)   then we may conclude that sound level inside this light aircraft's cockpit offers circumstances that are very not comfortable, if not dangerous, to humans. In fact they actually are dangerous since most sources and organisations, that I reviewed, requires ear protection equipment for environment with sound level at or above 85 dBA.  How can such conditions be good for transporting dogs? Are they much less sensitive to (quite extremely) high noise? "
1448,How do I deal with my cat puncturing my skin when I pick her up to cuddle her on my lap?,"Just got a rescue cat (my avatar) in March. When I try to pick her up and cuddle her on my lap, she grips with her nails and causes puncture holes on my skin. How do I teach her not to do that? I cant even clip her nails, our vet said the only way in her case is to sedate her?  Is that the only way? Should I give her back to the rescue? We can't even pet her without being attacked. She loves to cuddle when she wants to. "
1449,Dog gets upset with any motion on the television. How can I desensitize her to it?,"I just adopted a new dog who has a strange trigger: she gets really upset and starts barking wildly when there is motion on the television, even backing out of the room in fear. I did a number of tests (spaced out across several hours to not stress her out too much) and found the following:  Things that don't bother her   Nothing is displayed, but TV is on (ruling out being bothered by the TV making a high pitched sound that humans can't hear) A menu or other static screen Static pictures of an environment Me watching a show on an iPad with the volume up or playing a computer game with the volume up (ruling out that it's a noise issue)   Things that do bother her   A cartoon with motion A live action scene with motion Both of the above when the volume is muted   What I found especially interesting was a video of someone doing a close up of some electronics. She was fine when the shot just showed the electronics sitting on a table, but as soon as a hand came on screen, and especially if the presenter manipulated the electronics (like opening a panel to reveal additional buttons), she started growling. I tried to comfort her, an eventually she deliberately tried to ignore watching the TV, but still seemed a bit on edge.  As described in Do dogs see television and computers the way we do?, dogs don't see screens like we do. Still, the motion seems to bother her and I'd hate to give up TV watching entirely. My apartment is kind of small, and so far she's preferred to stay within sight of me. How can I desensitize her to the television so that I can watch it normally? "
1450,Cultures where dogs are not being walked,"I´ve seen alot of talking about walking one dog or not, but this question is more about cultures where dog are simply not being walked because their function is a bit different than what is usually assumed.    I´m referring to villages in The Philippines that I´ve visited a couple of times - and probably many other places on this planet where dogs primarily are kept to alarm against burglars.    On an early sidenote, I always wondered how people would even know that there´s a burglar, cause the dogs are barking allover the neighborhood the whole night long, nonstop!     Anyway, the dogs pet function is there as well - more for some than for others - but they´re never being walked, period.  I´ve noticed that a lot of these dogs are not cuddly and very interested people, and even the cuddliest one I met who came and put its head on my lap while looking at me, would be very confused about what the idea was of throwing a ball that it could catch.   The good thing is that the dogs can come and go as they want. They may be staying over at other peoples (with dogs) places for weeks, causing great frustration of their owners of course. In such a case, I knew that the dog was never mistreated or not given enough food.. I think it simply just liked another certain dog at that other place.  So summa sumarum, they are given the same freedom as cats, who are also not being walked.  I know cats and dogs are not the same kind of animals at all, but I guess that when it comes to socializing they live a much better life than their counterparts that are being walked every day, because they get to meet other dogs whenever they feel like it.   On the other hand, they don´t get much exercised this way but actually don´t suffer from obesity at all. Probably because their diet is different, or maybe their kind (ascals, they´re called) has a higher metabolism.  What do you people think? Is it in a dogs DNA to only be happy when walked 3 times a day, or is this something we teach them to appreciate? Can they not have a good life without that, when actually being left to do what a dog wants to do? "
1451,Husky puppy if I have cats: Yes or no?,"I had two dogs, my ex stole them, now I am considering my legal options and also looking at buying two new dogs if things don't go my way.  I have a kitten, I got her to keep me company till I get my dogs (and after :) ). I am also considering getting a husky puppy as one of the two dogs.  Can this work out? Can I teach the husky to leave the kitten alone? My tolerance for random cat body parts in the living room is rather low. "
1452,What are the implications of one cat vs two cats?,"I have a kitten, will get / recover two dogs (I used to have two dogs, stolen by my ex. I will either get them through courts or buy two new ones).   I am trying to figure out whether I should have one or two cats. What are the implications of having two cats?  Do cats need socialization with their own species like dogs?  Is there a risk of the two cats not getting along and having to be kept separated like extra-small pitbulls? "
1453,My kitten keeps peeing on a specific place outside of his litter box,"Note : There are a lot of questions about can and toilet issues but I didn't find any matching my personnal issue (same spot everytime, cat still uses the litter box). Here are some questions that I found that doesn't match my question :   Why does my cat pee on the rug outside the toilet? : This question is about a cat that doesn't pee on the toilets anymore, while my cat still goes to his litterbox. My cat also acts on a specific spot only How do I stop my cat from peeing on rugs and linens? : This question is about a cat that had bad habits and have a hard time forgetting them, which is not the case of my cat My cat is peeing around the litter box : This question is about a much older cat with possible kidney issues, which  I don't think is the case of my kitten How can I stop my cats from urinating in the pet carrier? : This question is about fear related events     Since last month, my almost 4 months old kitten peed 4-5 times outside of his litter box on a specific spot of my bed. I adopted him when he was 2 months old, already weaned, and he has been very clean apart from those accidents on my bed. He still does pee and poo in his litter box. Everytime it happends, we are on the bed and not sleeping (watching TV).  Every time it happended,  I washed the sheets and made sure there was as little odor as possible, but he keeps peeing on the same specific spot of the bed. We (my girlfriend, him and me) sleep together on my bed but this doesn't seem to happend at night.   The vet said it may be some kind of revenge, but I didn't manage to identify any pattern on why he would pee on my bed.  He is otherwise completely healthy and we have a good relationship (we cuddle, we play together, ...)  Why does he keeps doing this and what can I do to help him stop? "
1454,W/could you add catnip to cat food (canned or dry) to get my cats to eat it?,"Can or should you add catnip to dry or moist cat food to get your cat to eat it? Should you even try to do so? If not any substitutions that you can recommend? Granted not all cats like catnip, but most do. "
1455,why is my cat staring at me?,"Sometimes i find myself in this situation where i don't know what to do, my cat is staring at me and i feel guilty to not know what she wants from me. She keeps staring until she feels tired and sometimes sleeps while sitting, not laying. As if there was something really interesting and needs thinking that made her forget to lay down to sleep. I blink or close my eyes to show her a cat kiss, but she still looks at me either after she blinks using two eyes or without blinking, just continue's to stare.   What do i do? why is she staring at me for such a long time? "
1456,"My kitten licks me constantly, should I be worried?","I got a 12 week old kitten about two weeks ago, he seems like he's settled in nicely. (He's always sitting around me, when I'm home), but he's constantly licking me every time he's near me, like every-time (for several minutes at a time).  I've heard in the grapevine of pet owners, that it could be something to do with anxiety? Is this true, should I be worried? Or is he just trying to be playful i.e. a kitten's version of a pet? I'm quite new to owning a kitten, so any advice is welcome. "
1457,How to stop a cat from breaking glasses?,"When my cat drinks water from her water bowl she leaves in peace. But whenever I give her water from another bowl, she drinks then tries to break the glass. She pushes it with her nose and throws it off the surface it was on. If it was on the floor she'd still push it until she recognizes nothing is going to happen.  Why is she doing that? How do I stop her? "
1458,Are there health consequences if I don't spay my cat?,"I'm thinking of spaying my cat sense most people suggest I do so. But I'm still not convinced about why I should do that. My cat doesn't have behaviour issues, she acts like a normal cat would, she's nice to humans and doesn't like cats alot, except when she's ready for mating. I'd like her to have kittens at some point in her life and I'd love to help take care of them. People still ask me to spay and say it's better if done.  So my question is, why is spaying that important if you agree to let your cat have kittens and are welling to take care of them? Are there health consequences for not spaying your cat? "
1459,Does a cat necessarily get sick after giving birth?,"Lots of feral cats give birth and end up fine. Can a house cat give birth and not get ill? Do house cats always get sick after giving birth?   What are examples of sicknesses she can get from giving birth? Must I take her to the vet if she's ready to give birth? If so, why? Wouldn't it be easier for her to have it in her home?  I'm asking this question due to the concerns of people telling me not to breed my cat while I think it's fine,but I'm worried now so someone please answer and explain why I should or shouldn't be worried. I consider this to be a very important question, because I'm deciding to let my cat have her babies in my home. "
1460,Training multiple pets: separately or together?,"I'm using a clicker to train two cats. I would like them to respond specifically, i.e. I want to be able to direct a command to one cat and not the other when both cats are present.   If I train them separately (i.e. take one into a separate room), and get one of them to be able to respond to a command, how will that cat know that the command issued is not meant for her when the two cats are together?  If I train them together in the same room, how do I make one do nothing while the other responds?  Do I need two different clicker tones? Should I incorporate their names into the voice command? I'm worried that overuse of their name will dilute the semantic content of the sound of their names and will confuse them when all commands begin with calling their name, as opposed to distinct sounds for different commands.   As a side question, will they learn faster when trained together? Can they learn by watching the other one perform the command? "
1461,Can desert/beach sand work as an alternative for litter?,"So here's my story, I find myself traveling out of the city once each month and I'll have to leave my cat home alone for a day to three days. I live in an area where it's hard to buy litter due to the small amount of shops to sell it, not mentioning the far distance I need to take every time I have to buy some. I had two cats,one of them transmetted worms to the other so I had to deworm both. I also had to get rid of the old litter. Unfortunately it's time to travel and I have but little amount of litter, which meant a problem because leaving my cat for 3 days with just a little amount of litter meant to have a really dirty bathroom and an irritated kitty to come back to. I still needed to leave so while I was on my way we stopped to let our kids play in the sand and I thought why not get some clean sand in case of emergencies like this one?   Is this a good idea? I'm talking about sand that's clean to the eye, and ofcourse I'll make sure to check it atleast two times before getting it into to my house. And my cat goes poo to anything that's put in her litter box so I don't think she'll mind it.   Thank you "
1462,My cat is scared of my grandkids?,"My cat literally pooped himself because he's terrified of my grandkids and a flotation device he saw in their wading pool. He never does this, he just started when they came to visit. They have visited before but not for this long of a time. They go home in 3 days.   Their ages are 13,10,7,&amp; 6. He really freaked out with the flotation device. But he pooped on the floor and on the rug.   Could it be the noisiness? The kids? Both?  "
1463,First time owning a cat,"This is the first time I have a cat in my life. She is almost 10 months. She came home yesterday and she was wandering around the house, which has a litter box, food, and water.   This morning, I found my cat hiding under the bed and she hasn't come out since then. She isn't drinking nor eating. She isn't even thinking about coming out.   How do I make this cat eat or drink? Would treats help it out? "
1464,Damp weather and kitty litter,"So for the last 2 weeks, it's been extremely damp weather here with a relative humidity of about 90%.    There are also 2 other things which are happening since the last 2 weeks.      Kitty litter is getting consumed really fast - at twice the speed as before. The litter seems damp all the day &amp; when I scoop, more litter is getting scooped out every day.    The smell of ammonia is strong in the litter. It wasn't so before 2 weeks. Though I can smell the ammonia only when I am scooping - not otherwise - it's not strong enough to permeate the space around the box or anything.   Are these 2 things related to the dampness &amp; humidity? What can be done cheaply to fix this?   I use clumping litter. "
1465,How can I tell if my cat is bullying her sister and what can I do to combat the problem?,"I have two cats from the same litter that I adopted when they were around 12 weeks old. They are going to be a year old in two days, and as of recently I have been wondering if there's something wrong.  Chilli is the bigger and much more approachable one, while Luna is very quiet, petite and usually lets her sister be first in a lot of aspects.  Chilli as of recently started occupying Luna's favorite sleeping spots - ironing board, top of a wardrobe, armchair. This would be seen on various occasions and Luna would rarely sleep or rest in these spots afterwards.  I also caught my cats - from what it looked like - playfighting as any other cats would do, however I noticed that it is mostly Chilli that will 'attack' her first and it is also mostly her that will continue after a few second pauses. Today, I was doing my stuff in the bathroom when all of a sudden Luna meowed, very likely asking me to open the door for her. After a few seconds I opened the door only to find that Chilli was literally sitting on top of her and was licking her face. Luna looked extremely uncomfortable and jumped out of Chilli's grasp in a matter of seconds.  On several occasions, Chilli would approach Luna and attempt to clean her, however Luna would usually resort to escape.  Although there are times when even Luna sleeps beside Chilli and cleans her, should I be concerned about how Luna is treated by her sister? Oh and also, I think it's valuable to say that Luna is the cat that rubs against the house members' legs and some other furniture, while Chilli does not do this at all. Lastly, my mother spotted that they rarely eat together when given wet food, and that is something that did not happen before. Chilli becomes uninterested with the food when she sees Luna eating it. Chilli would usually eat after Luna is gone and not in the surroundings.  Overall, is there anything that suggests that my cat is bullying her sister, and if yes, is there anything I can do to approach this problem? "
1466,Can I train my ferret for ferreting?,"Ferrets were originally domesticated and bred for ""ferreting"", which means going into rodent holes and chasing out the resident rats/mice/rabbits/etc into traps.  I live on a property that has lots of ground squirrels, and their holes are something of a nuisance and a danger to my family's horses. The rest of my family seems to think killing them is acceptable, while I believe it to be morally akin to mass murder. I would prefer to find a more humane way of removing the ground squirrels, and relocating them alive would certainly be an improvement.  I don't have a ferret yet, but I am planning on getting one soon.  Could I train my (future) ferret to chase the ground squirrels out of their holes? If so, how should I go about doing this and/or what resources should I refer to? "
1467,"Why does my cat eat inedible things, how can I stop it, and what are the medical side-effects?","My cat has a bad and frequent habit of eating (or trying to eat) inedible items. Specifically, she tends to eat plastic trash bags, cardboard, and paper, though she is especially prone to eating the trash bags. She has been doing this since she moved in with me almost two years ago, and she has done it consistently. She is otherwise a healthy, affectionate cat, who eats all of her food and is active around the house.  The only thing I have figured out to prevent it is to either lay a very thick coating of some kind of repellent such as this, or to simply put my garbage cans in a closet.   Why does she like to eat inedible things? What can I do to teach her not to? What kind of negative medical side effects can happen from this?  "
1468,Affect of Kh on Neocaridina Shrimp,"It is my understanding that, in the aquarium, Kh (carbonate hardness) raises the PH slightly, but primarily acts as a ""buffer"", preventing large PH swings.  For Neocaridina shrimp (I keep red cherries, but I suppose for any Neos) I have seen recommended Kh levels from anywhere between 0 to 3.  Though, most common is probably 1-2.  However, I read that several very successful shrimp breeders don't supplement their RO water with any Kh whatsoever, using only Gh+ remineralizers.  What are the pros and cons of forgoing the addition of Kh to Neocaridina tanks?  It does give you the opportunity to add other Kh sensitive species like Tigers or Bees (shrimp species not cats or insects), but are there any other benefits?  Are there any cons besides having a less stable Ph?  Why is having a less stable Ph not a concern for these breeders? "
1469,"Kitten stopped using litterbox, how should I correct him?","I have a male, 5 month old kitten. I received him at 2 months old from a friend. When I brought him home he didn't use the litter box, but I realized that he didn't like the litter. Since then, I changed the litter, and he started using the box with no problem. Now, all of a sudden, he stopped using the litter box again. He now uses my dog's beds, blankets, pillows, clothing, anything fabric.  I clean out the box about twice a week, and change the litter about every 1-2 weeks. I use the Nature's Miracle pet cleaner and Arm and Hammer baking soda to try to remove the scent as best as possible.  I know that it's not like he can't make it to the box because I've seen him go up to the box, sniff it, then do his businesses a foot away. I do have a couple of ferrets who have yet to learn that they too need to use their own litter box, but the cat is not allowed around the ferrets, so I don't think he could have seen them.  I tried disciplining him, but this seems to do nothing. Also, every time he uses the litter box, whether on his own or with me having to correct him, I try to reward him. Would anyone know why he suddenly stopped using the litter box after three months of no problems? And what else should I do to try to correct this behavior?  "
1470,How to remineralize distilled water?,"Last August I decided to by a new 10 gallon tank and buy a new Betta.  I set my tank up and went to a local Spring source where people get drinking water from a pipe coming out of the mountain. I had the fish store test and set up my tank and my beautiful Betta dies within a few days.  So just cleaned the tank. I kept it going all this time with no fish just a piece of drift wood and one live plant. Then I filled it with distilled water.  Should I add aquarium salt? And how long do I need to wait before adding my Betta?  Also, I do have a large piece of real drift wood purchased from a fish store in the tank. I understand the tannins are beneficial. "
1471,Salt Water Fish Tank Requirements,"I'm looking to get a 75-100 gallon salt water fish tank. I have done some research but still, I am not too educated on this matter.   If I am looking to have about 5-10 fish (the average salt water fish you can find at your local store) in my tank, what is the most efficient yet cost-effective setup? I do not want that I have to constantly clean the tank.   I'm leaning towards a hang on protein skimmer. Is this a good idea? Also what else would I need? I also don't want to have anything that requires major plumbing. "
1472,What to do if I am with my dog and an aggressive and unleashed dog approaches us?,"There are plenty of instructions on what to do if approached by a dog, for example this one : [website]But how does this change if I have my dog with me? And he is the target of the other dog?  I have an English springer spaniel and when we walk, sometimes we come across unleashed dogs who approach and start fighting, and don't follow their owner's commands. German shepherd, staffordshire terrier and boxer, those are the breeds.  I can tell my dog to stand still, I can put the leash on him. But trying to not let a fight happen can be difficult at times. And breaking one up as well.  Shouting angrily in a deep voice works most of the time. But sometimes dogs just ignore me, and try to ran past me to attack my dog.  Another question, related to first one, what should I do if some dog is biting mine, and not letting go? I have not had this happen to me, but a neighbor had his collie badly hurt by a boxer. He was unable to get him off until boxer's owner came.  There is plenty of information on these questions on the internet, but it is hard for me to understand the quality of information in this case. And I don't want to do something stupid if the described situation happens. I hope that here  I will get answers from knowledgeable people, typical to StackExchange communities.  Thank you! "
1473,Does fur protect a rabbit from heat or make it hotter?,"There are various suggestions I have read on how to keep a rabbit cool in hot and extreme heat conditions, including here.   What none of these seem to address is the suitability of shaving or trimming the rabbit's fur.  I have read various opinions on this and they range from ""don't do it unless you have special expensive equipment like a vet"" or ""don't do it because the fur will protect the bunny from the heat"" to ""it will definitely help to keep the rabbit cooler"".  There are also differing opinions on how short a cut should be.  I have had experience shaving rabbit fur, but not expressly for the purpose for dealing with being outdoors in hot weather, so I am familiar with the issues doing the actual shaving, but not with the practicality of it.  Will shaving a rabbit help them to better deal with the heat?  Will it be helpful in filling gaps in other cooling methods when they aren't possible, for instance those which appear to require frequent presence to refresh cold water or frozen water bottles? "
1474,How can I help an unfriendly dog with a serious wound?,"I feel like seeing coils of intestine through the cut wound or it may be the muscle I'm not sure. A staff here said its infested with maggots. The dog is kinda irritated one , doesn't allow any one to go near  . we are unable to restrain him. So i can't find out whether its infested with maggots. I see no signs of pus or blood. Since it is in breast area he has the access to lick it. But for precaution can i spray med. turpentine oil ? Will it cause harm if maggots aren't there? Would oral ivernectin heal that ? Or any other antibiotic course should be given? "
1475,"How do carnivores (cats, dogs) catabolize protein for energy?","If cats are obligate carnivores and require no carbohydrate in their diet, do they derive all the glucose their cells need through gluconeogenesis? Some sources I've found state that carnivores get their glucose from the animals they're eating, but that conflicts with the fact that they say cats and dogs require NO CARBOHYDRATE in their diet whatsoever. My guess is they just catabolize protein for energy and are better equipped to deal with the acidic waste products than humans are?  "
1476,How do I stop my 10 month old puppy from eliminating on the carpet?,"We have a 1 year old puppy, part Anatolian Shepherd and the rest unknown, who has been with us since she was 5 weeks old.  We went to adopt a 2 year old Basenji from a rescue but it didn't work out, and the kids fell in love with this little girl while we were there.  This is our first dog and we're still learning as we go.  My partner was not comfortable with crate training as the puppy whimpered horribly even at being in a box or crate for the night, and it felt cruel to leave her there (in retrospect this was probably a mistake).  She was allowed in the linoleum hallway and kitchen and the carpeted family room, including on the couch, gated off from the rest of the home.  We took her hour every 30 minutes for the first 6 months, every hour for the next 3, and every 1-2 hours since then.  We also take her out any time we see sniffing or agitation, though we can't watch her 24/7.  She both urinated and defecated on the family room floor and hallway floor at first.  This was easy to clean from the latter.  The former we soaked all we could then treated with Nature's Miracle to eliminate the odor.  When we did so we scolded her when we caught her in the act and then led her outside.  When she goes outside, even now, she is verbally praised and receives attention, which makes her happy.  Over time she has tended to go outside more and more.  She seems better about urination outside than about defecation.  Our morning routine was to wake up, let her out, feed her while having breakfast, and often by 20 minutes later she had defecated on the floor.  We've begun letting her out a second time after breakfast, but she still sometimes comes in and goes on the floor instead.  It seems like she may not be able to control it, but by this age I had thought she should be able to.  My only remaining thought is that the scent from past 'accidents' may be making her want to go, though I shampooed the carpet last month with Nature's Miracle mixed in.  Last night we returned home from a 2 hour shopping trip.  She had managed to undo our gate, go up the stairs where she is only allowed to be on the way to bed at night, and urinate in the hallway.  There has never been an accident upstairs and should be no scent, so I was very confused at why she would do this.  All of my hypothesis seem to have been invalidated now.  Is this likely a training issue, and age issue, or a medical issue?  How do I address it?  The longer it goes on the worse the smell gets inside, which I fear will eventually make it impossible to stop.  I would like to add that she is a very good girl otherwise, though very stubborn at times. "
1477,How does care differ between a Labrador and Cane Corso?,"We have a Labrador of 15 months and we are looking for a Cane Corso puppy. Our Labrador is quite big for a Labrador. Both dogs will be male.  What I do wonder, is if this the best combination, since Labrador's have a complete different character as Cane Corso's.  Anyone that has experience with this 2 dogs combined? I know a Labrador needs a lot of exercise, so we take 3 walks a day, with 2 walks of minimal 1 hour. Can we take the Cane Corso (when full grown) on these long walks too, or would it be bad for their joints?  What should we be aware of when these two type of dogs get together?   Some advice on how to care for these two breeds together would be totally welcome! "
1478,Considerations before getting mussels (or other bivalve),"I'm looking for alternative natural filters for my tank to combat algae. I've read that a mussel can filter up to 100 gallons/day, consuming algae and detritus.  My concerns are:     I grow copepods and other microorganisms.  Will this filter feeder wipe out the population (eg Consume the zooplankton that is the next generation)?  We already dose the tank with phytoplankton, which I suspect is the main source of my algae.  I'm hoping this will be a two-birds situation. My tank volume is about 135gal.  Filtering that much volume, will I have to eventually start supplementing their diet? What other requirements do they have?  Can they survive in fine substrate, such as aragonite? They would probably be more efficient in the main tank, but with my starfish and crabs it'd probably be happier in the sump. Would clams, oysters, etc be better suited for this task? How many would be appropriate for this size tank to be both efficient but not starving them?  Do they quickly proliferate?  "
1479,Is it safe to feed bacon to a pet pig?,"I'm simply curious, I have read that pigs make very good house pets and are delighted to eat just about anything  Firstly, would a pig eat pork?   If so, is it safe to feed a pig its own kind? "
1480,Does a cat know when to stop eating?,"If I'm not mistaken, a dog doesn't know when to stop eating (I've never had one, so I can't be sure).  But what about cats? If I take a large bowl with delicious looking fish and leave it in front of a cat, will the cat eat until it's full or until the food is gone? "
1481,"Can a new cat owner, with no experience handling animals, be expected to successfully restrain a cat using a towel?","I need to give my cat ear medicine because he previously had ear mites (before adoption, he was a stray), and his eye medicine because he has herpes induced conjunctivitis, which isn't serious yet, but once in a while you can make out he closes one a little more than the other.   I've had a look at the videos I was able to find through google, and understand the basic ""scarf technique"" for restraining a cat using a towel. The issues I am having:   My cat is not even a little interested in sitting still on a towel -- I pick him up, and place him in the middle of a laid out towel, and he's already struggling to leap away. I tried giving him treats whenever he plops down on a towel, but as soon as I begin wrapping, he's well on his way to running away The ""Y"" finger hold around his neck doesn't get him to be still as I try to wrap him up   My take on the issue is that my relationship with him is still new: I only adopted him about 10 days ago. He has been a total blast so far: got used to the new house within a couple of days (he started playing with me in his safe room in the first hour he was home!), uses the litter box like a champ, absolutely loves cuddles and playing, eats food, drinks water, leaves people alone when they are sleeping -- basically, does everything without any of the difficulties I was warned about.   However, he still doesn't trust me much, it seems, given his behaviour with the towel...so, maybe that's a hint we are still ""new""? What am I supposed to do though, if he really needs his medicine? How do I get him to understand that I promise I would not hurt him? I can't. He doesn't understand words.  Is my theory about being in a new relationship with a cat correct? I don't think it is, because vets are able to do what they need to with new animals all the time, but I simply do not have the training of a vet. What are my options?  "
1482,Holding Rabbit by the scruff of her neck,Will it hurt our rabbit if we calm her down and to then hold her up by the scruff of her neck? We've done it before; she seemed squirmy at first but then she calmed down when we held her up by the scruff of her neck. Does it affect our rabbit in any way if we do it. How and how will it affect her in future life? 
1483,Can an elderly cat adjust to a new cat in the household?,"In the past I had a pair of littermates who I'd adopted at the age of 10 weeks.  When they were around 12 years old I asked my vet how old would be ""too old"" to adopt an additional cat -- that is, at what age would they not be able to tolerate an addition -- and she said ""pretty soon"".  I had the impression that she was making this judgement based on their age and not an evaluation of their individual personalities.  My current cats are middle-aged (about 6 and 8), and while my spouse has informed me that we have no plans to adopt more cats, it got me wondering about my vet's past advice.  Is there such a thing as ""too old for new additions""?  If so, when is it in general and how can I tell if my cats have reached it?  How relevant is the age of the newcomer?  (I can imagine arguments for getting another older cat and arguments for getting a non-threatening kitten.)  For purposes of this question, assume that all cats involved are basically healthy and well-adjusted indoor-only neutered cats. "
1484,Anti-rabies vaccination once in 3 years for pets in countries like India?,"My pet dog, a 4-year old Golden Retriever, gets vaccinated against rabies once every year.  A few months ago I found out that most of the core vaccines for dogs provide immunity for 3 years, so I checked and found out that the anti-rabies vaccine the vet is administering my dog actually meets the three year duration of immunity.  So I called and asked him why he's been administering it to my dog every year instead of once in 3 years. He replied along the lines of:     It's true that these vaccines provide immunity for 3 years but for dogs in North American and European countries because there the weather is pleasant and cooler than in India. In India dogs get stressed and it often gets very very hot. So, we need to do it once a year.   I didn't quite find the explanation relevant or promising, but I didn't study veterinary medicine. So here I ask—is it true? or can I safely go with once in 3 years?  (PS: I am from a small city in India and unfortunately my vet isn't knowledgeable/competent enough, and he's the only one around.) "
1485,How can I show a cat that I am unhappy with one of their actions?,"Sometimes, my cat paws me while playing, with his nails out, and it hurts. Sometimes, he's a jerk and doesn't let me brush off litter dust from his paws.   If I say ow, and make a sad face, he probably won't understand much.  What can I do to say ""ow, stop"" in cat language? What about ""I am sad that you did what you just did""? What about ""please stop being mean""? "
1486,Adverse reaction to Catnip,"One of my cats seems to have an adverse reaction to catnip. When it is around, he gets agitated and attacks the other animals and anyone that comes near. It only happens with catnip-infused toys, but when he is exposed to ground catnip from a vial, he has no reaction what-so-ever.  Is there anything that can be done to improve his reaction, since the other cat loves catnip and has the normal, high reaction to it? Should I just avoid getting catnip infused toys for the house, or is there a way to remove the catnip, since everything seems to be infused with catnip?   "
1487,What quality of life will my cat have after edentation?,"My cat has some gum infection (virus) and the vet recommend a complete edentation (removal of all teeth). It is very sad to see my cat with its gum almost bleeding all the time ...  The cat (spayed) is 6 years old and has a good overall health.  Without judging the actual benefit for this specific problem, are there any life-long problem to be expected ? Can the cat eat properly (dry food) after that ? "
1488,Are ambient noises useful for keeping the dog calm while I'm away?,"I live in an apartment and when I'm away or busy doing work in another room, I feel bad for the dog because there is nothing really for him to do. He doesn't have much interest in his toy (I should find some new ones) and he doesn't have  I know it would bug me to be locked inside for most of the day in a quiet room, but I also know dogs are not humans. Should I leave the TV on for him or put some ambient noise on the speakers? If so, what ambient noises are good? Suggestions? "
1489,Why do cats like catnip?,Pretty much every cat I have ever owned has always liked catnip; so much so that they go nuts whenever I give them a catnip-related toy to play with. Why do some cats love it so much? What's in that stuff? 
1490,Should I be concerned that my cat has become more vocal since losing his sister?,"Back history:   Joey and Pheobe are two and a half year old Bengal/Domestic crosses (1/2 Bengal) and both are/were reasonably vocal but not to any level of excess. Joey was (we assume) hit by a car in late Summer 2013 and had to be kept caged for two months whilst his back leg healed. During this time his sister (Pheobe) could get quite freaked out by him, presumably because he smelled ""ill"". Pheobe, his sister, was last seen October 5th. This was two months since Joey had been allowed out of his cage, under house arrest for a month and allowed outside for the second month. They were socialising normally and playing as they'd previously been seen to.   Question:  Since Pheobe disappeared, Joey has become a lot more vocal. When he comes in during the day/evening he'll meow loudly (verging on yowling) to ""announce"" his arrival. When he comes in at night, if we're in bed (asleep or otherwise) he'll meow very, very loudly as he comes up the stairs to the bedroom. Previously he meowed a little when coming upstairs at night, but not a lot at other times (other than if he was picked up and not in the mood to be!).    Should I be concerned at this change in his behaviour? Is he ""acting out"" as he's lost his sister/playmate and is missing companionship? Is there anything I could do, or should do, to manage this behaviour in a way that's beneficial to him?   (Note: He's recently had his boosters / a check-up and the Vet had no concerns regarding his health) "
1491,Is it safe to use tung oil to waterproof a rabbit enclosure?,"I'm thinking about building my own wooden rabbit enclosure and want to waterproof it for ease of clean-up. If I use tung oil to waterproof the wood, will it harm the rabbits (as long as the wood is cured and the oil has not been freshly applied)?  If this oil is toxic to rabbits, how else can I waterproof the wood?  [website]"
1492,What's the most comfortable way (for the dogs) to carry two chihuahua's outside?,"We have three chihuahuas in our family, two of which are unable to walk down stairs so I often find myself having to carry them outside. They don't like to do anything outside, if the whole group isn't there and I don't like leaving them outside without supervision, even momentarily. So, I find myself having to carry both of them outside on one go, one on each hand.  What would be the optimal way to carry them so that they would feel as comfortable as possible on the way? Should I really be taking them outside one-by-one instead, and leaving the other two unattended for a moment, while I carry the third one? "
1493,How can I tell whether my horse recognizes his name?,"I've been wondering if my horse understands his name.  By ""understand"", I mean ""does he know I address him in particular if I call his name""?  I'm not really sure how to verify this, but I'm tempted to think the answer is no and therefore it does not make sense to give names to horses other than to make it convenient for humans to refer to them. On the other hand, my cats understand their names and if I call one particular cat, most of the time only the one I call comes running. Therefore, it would not be surprising if horses could learn their name, too.  So please, if anyone could share any personal experiences that either prove or refute it it would be truly helpful to me.   How can I tell whether my horse recognizes his name?  Is there any training that can be done to help my horse recognize his name? "
1494,Are cats an appropriate pet if I am not home for most of the day?,"I love cat, I also work a full time job and am in the office from 11 till 9.   I would like to get a cat but am afraid that my being gone for so long will be a problem.    Are there problems that arise from being away from home for 10 or so hours a day when having a cat as a pet?  Is there anything I can do to minimize the problems or is it just better I not get a cat for a pet? "
1495,How to test one deaf ear of a cat?,"A dominant white cat with blue eyes is said to be at high risk of being deaf. (Here the ""dominant"" refers to the white color gene, not behaviour.) In case of a white cat with odd eyes, the ear on the side with the blue eye may be deaf, though in some rare cases an odd-eyed cat can also be totally deaf.      That's one of the cats I have. Totally white fur, pink pads and ears, and odd eyes. I have tested her for hearing and it seems quite obvious that she can hear, but does she hear only with one ear or two? How would I test if she's deaf in the ear on the blue side? "
1496,Help! Rabbit has a circular bald spot. It's very red and has hardened,"  I was busy a couple days ago and and when I checked on him I found this. Is this from stress? Is this a wound from over grooming? The spot is dry, hard and red. It's circular and very distinct from the skin nearby. The rest of his skin is normal. Behavior wise he is very happy, binkying around like usual. He eats normally. His droppings are solid. Does anyone know what's wrong? I want to take him to the vet but I don't know any rabbit savvy vet in my city, since rabbits are a very uncommon pet in my country. "
1497,What books explain most comprehensively the lure and reward method of dog training?,"Having first read some reviews of several books on canine clicker training, in the hunt for works that experienced trainers would list among the ""must read"" books on the subject, I have now finished Karen Pryor's Reaching the Animal Mind and I am part-way through her earlier Don't Shoot the Dog. Pryor has been a leading figure in the development of the marker method as it has been used with dolphins, dogs, and other species, including humans. In my opinion in the first three-quarters or so of her first-mentioned book she gives an admirably clear and waffle-free explanation of the marker method as it is used with dogs (and a clicker) as well as with other species (such as dolphins, with whom the usual marker is a whistle).  Since she expounds a method that uses positive reinforcement only, it is no surprise that she criticises the traditional use of dominance and aversion. But she is also critical of lure and reward, a rival positive approach, which she views as likely to produce dogs who are overly passive even when the method is used together with a clicker.  I wish to form my own opinion on this other positive method that she is criticising. So my question is as follows. What books have you read that, in light of your practical experiences, you believe most comprehensively explain the lure and reward method of training dogs and the ideas that underlie it? Perhaps there are some books by some of the key figures who developed this approach? At the moment, I don't even know who those figures are. I know some of the popular writers, but not who the main shapers of the method have been. (For the clicker method there is Pryor and then the line goes back through at least three of B F Skinner's students.)  (Note: I phrased this question after reading the help file. It is intended to be ""constructive subjective"", ""[inviting the] sharing [of] experiences over opinions"" and soliciting only ""opinion [that is] backed up with facts and references"".) "
1498,What to do when moving next to a bird sanctuary with a loosely-domesticated cat?,"I'm about to move and a really promising location in a new city and it's surrounded by a large forest and bird sanctuary. That's great to me, but to my cat I suspect it will mean the beginning of his reign as a genocidal maniac against the local birds. On the one hand, regardless of where I move it seems this cat will be a bane on wildlife. On the other hand, given that this is a bird sanctuary, it feels particularly wrong to move there with this cat and just let it do its thing.  TL;DR skipping details on bottom: 3 year old Cat is very active and violent, otherwise a good cat to us humans. Never able to keep a collar or even harnesses on him. We rescued him off the streets and he's only semi-domesticated, keeping him indoors seems like barely an option.  With all that in mind, what can we do regarding this move and this cat to minimize disturbance to the bird sanctuary? Is it a no go, either we don't move there or we give away the cat? Is there any training or equipment we can use to minimize him disturbing the bird sanctuary? We could try to force him to be an indoor cat but I don't think he'll handle that well, it seems very against his nature. We could just let him do his thing, but we care a lot about the forest and know that cats can wreak havoc on its wildlife.    Some background on the cat: my partner and I met this cat as it meowed from under a porch as we were discussing getting a cat, an idea that we'd been considering for a few weeks. It was mid-February in a northern climate and very cold and snowy. We meowed at the cat for a bit and pretty fast he came and met us. We inspected the cat, picking him up and checking his fur and body out. He was pretty clean, no fleas we could see, seemed to be in good health. His paws and teeth indicated that this cat had been leaving outdoors for at least a few months, and he was mature but &lt;1 year old from what the vet said.  We've had this cat for a few years now. He was a real terror at first in terms of violence; he was mostly playful and not that aggressive but he was strong and intense in playing, would attack our feet and attack us at night if he had the chance. Over time and being neutered he's gotten better in some ways but is still an aggressive, big and tough cat. He used to go outside and disappear for days at a time when we first got him, but he'd keep coming back, even after we moved with him to new rentals locally a few times. Now he'll only go out for a few hours or a day at most, but he still begs to go out, tries to sneak out, and will even start attacking us more often if we refuse to let him out for a few days.  This cat in some ways good and maybe even trainable - extremely food motivated, will walk on a leash, never had any problems using a litter box, minimal scratching of furniture. At the same time, he can be a monster, half-killing chipmunks and leaving dead mice at our door regularly. We've tried collars and even two harnesses and he escaped all of them within days, though we do have him RFID chipped (unless he got rid of that too!)  I've seen my cat with 2 sparrows he's brought home dead in the past, he does 'cat chattering' when watching birds out the window, and I saw him try to climb into a bush to catch a bird once which he probably would've succeeded had I not chased him away. He's also killed and maimed many other animals not just birds. "
1499,Identifying a cat parasite,"Yesterday I let a stray cat sleep on a chair on my balcony. After it got up, I saw it left dozens of blood filled parasites on the chair, but I'm not sure of which kind.  They are tiny (1-2mm diameter), very slow moving, some are black and some red-ish from blood, they pop easily and leave a bloody splatter, it's hard to see their legs, but they have small antennas.   I'm attaching a photo, but it's not great, as they are too small to easily photograph.    Can you identify it? Does it transfer to humans? What should I do? "
1500,"Skittish, hissing kitten","A few months I got my kitten and she was of course the typical shy, skittish kitten that would hide. I kept her in a room and would just sit with her, she would even hiss at me. She was only 10 weeks at the time. After a month, she finally got the courage to come out of the room and come to the bed but she wouldn't let you touch her or she'd run off. I called the lady I got her from and once I told her how the kitten was acting, and she told me that she probably traumatized her because she had been remodeling her home and the litter of kittens had got into a wall/cabinet and she didn't want them to go further so she panicked and blocked the area off, made lots of noise and kept reaching out for them. I mean, can you imagine how that may have looked for them? After hours of doing this, she said she still couldn't get them out so she waited until the mama cat came around and the kittens finally felt safe enough to come out, at which point she also blocked the area off so that they couldn't get in again.   Fast forward to today and my kitten only let's me touch her if I'm in the bed or sitting in the living. When I reach out (I under hand pet her so that it doesn't look like I'm trying to grab her but it doesn't work) to her from any other part of the house, she runs from like shes never seen me before even though she rubs on me all the time when I'm in one of her favorite spots. I don't chase her but sometimes if she gets stuck somewhere I can't grab her because she's so terrified, and now that she is older, she uses her claws and she hisses, I thought this behavior would stop but she will fight if she feels like shes being touched or if you have to grab her. It's like she doesn't trust me outside of those two areas she hisses and she runs off like she's never had human interaction. She will also run if you walk past her in an attempt to get away from you even if you're not trying to get her. She is always on high alert when she isn't in the bed or on the sofa, she runs from everything. When I give her treats and wet cat food, she wont come to me. I've waited 10-15 minutes with her and she just looks at me. Instead, she prefers that I drop off the food under the table or in a corner where she can be alone. How can I stop all this awful behavior? "
1501,Malinois in an appartment with enough exercise: Feasible?,"How feasible is it to have a Malinois in an apartment if given enough exercise?  I am joking that my dog will be ""exercise equipment"" - I think that an hour of biking in the morning plus some training/free play in the evening would be about right. He probably will also have a second dog to keep him company in during the day :)   Can this work out? Or am I setting myself up for failure and I should get a German Shepherd instead? (I had German Shepherds before. I am tired of wondering about problems with the hips, especially with lots of exercise.) "
1502,My cat loves coconut oil. Is it safe to give him some?,"I use coconut oil to moisturize my skin everyday. If my cat happens to be around me by the time I'm using the coconut oil, he goes nuts and tries to lick it from the jar. Occasionally I give him just a tiny bit (around the size of a pea) but he eats it and wants more.  The coconut oil I use is extra virgin, organic and cold pressed.  Is it safe to give him coconut oil everyday? If yes, is it good for him somehow? And how much and how often should I give him? "
1503,"Recently adopted 4 month old pomeranian puppy, I am concerned about his behavior","He is a 4 month unneutered male pomernanian. He seems to have a lot of energy and wants to socialize and play all the time. He isn't trained the way he should've been. I have had him for a week now. The first day, he did not whine nor cry. He isn't potty trained and had numerous accidents. The second to fourth day he gotten use to me and started interacting. He's much more shy and ""serious"" with my boy friend. He is very addicted to treats, that I noticed. Every time I reach for one to start training him he goes into an absolute frenzy.  Fifth day, I noticed he is whining now, when left in the playpen and crate, when left alone, when I leave for work. He doesn't whine with my boy friend or very minimal. I started seeing some aggression, anxiety and isn't eating as well. He still has accidents, but is a little better than before.  Sixth day, I am distraught. He has chewed on the floor board, peeing everywhere, doesn't want to go in his crate, or play pen. He isn't eating his kibble, only wet food. Nipping at face kind of like rushing at it. Biting hands (probably from teething) and cries whenever not in my presence.  Did I give him too much attention or not enough? Should I leave him alone not free roamin in my sight and to the minimal interactions (walk, play, feed, potty, train) and have him crated? I could use some advice. "
1504,Temporarily housing another cat,I have a spayed 4 years old female cat with me since she was a kitten. During these years I was pretty much the only living being she endured.  Fast forward this week; one of my friends decided a lengthy (two months) vacation and asked me to take care of her own 10 months old spayed female cat. We live pretty apart so going over to her house is not an optimal solution. Hence the question.  I know a great deal about introducing all kinds of cats. I have an empty room which the guest cat will stay with its own things/furnitures. I might  let them free inside the house unsupervised if everything goes well for the first couple of weeks.  Will it be awkward/bad for my cat after the guest returns the her owner? Or will she be relieved and will return to her previous self quickly ?  Note that while I appreciate the answers containing scientific experiments and results; I'm mainly looking for anecdotal evidences.  Edit: Both cats are mixed breeds and somewhat shy individuals. 
1505,"What are normal pH fluctuations, and what could be causing extreme fluctuations?","I measured my pH last night. One tank was &lt;6.2. Another, >7.4. And the last one was 6.8. This morning, about 12 hours later, they're all measuring &lt;6.2. I've added nothing but food to the water since last night.  Is that kind of fluctuation normal?  What would be normal fluctuations?  What could be causing these fluctuations?  How dangerous is this for the fish? "
1506,Temporarily Adopting a Problem Dog,"My in-laws had bought a puppy, of the breed Staffordshire Bull Terrier, to replace an elderly Staffordshire that died some 6 months before. They never had a puppy before and had little dog training experience. The dog, now about 6 months old, has some problematic behaviours which are largely because the my in-laws whole household (3 adults and a child) haven't dealt with the behaviour in the right way from a young age. I think they liked the idea of having a puppy, but didn't do the research before they got her and failed to apply consistent training.  I'm no dog training guru myself but I have adopted a problem dog from the dog's home in the past which had behavioural issues which  I had to overcome and I have assisted in training dogs when I was a child.  My in-laws have reached the point that they are seriously considering giving up the dog for to its behaviour.  The dog's issues I believe are centered around play aggression that they have inadvertently encouraged by rewarding the behaviour with attention. This had led to some situations with my own children and the 11 year old becoming scared of the dog, she bites and jumps at their faces. Unfortunately this behaviour is then re-enforced through her getting attention, or being lured away with dog treats. It hasn't yet turned into any dominance type aggression, it is mostly just over exuberant play at this stage.  I feel like the issues are easily solved so long as disciplined and consistent dog training practices are employed, they are going on holiday for two weeks soon and I'm considering looking after the dog for that time to try and make some improvement with training while they are away, but I have some worries as follows.   I have a dog, mentioned above, he is now a docile 8 year old, Collie Beagle cross. The staffy puppy would be coming into our house for two weeks and while the two dogs have met on a few occasions, it could cause tension between the two dogs if they are living in the same house. A lot of the puppies play aggression comes out when my young (2 and 5 year) kids are around, so bringing her into our house would place her into that trigger environment every day. I'm used to dog training and being the assertive alpha male, if I was able to make an improvement after two weeks, I'm worried that her then going back to her home may just confuse her, make her behaviour worse and she may just instantly revert to her old ways once under the charge of the in-laws again.   In short, I have one question. Is adopting her for two weeks and trying to 'fix' her behaviour in that period a terrible idea and could it result in more behavioural issues? Or is it worth while to prevent them giving up the dog permanently? "
1507,Animal for small aquarium,I have a very very small aquarium (2L of water). What kind of animal could live in this size of aquarium with enough happinness? Maybe a starfish? Or some kind of crustacean? 
1508,"My Koi is acting skittish suddenly, and found injuries","I've been keeping 2 young koi in an aquarium for a year now. They've grown bigger and accustom to me. Their tank is about 55-60 gallons, and I live in the northeast. They were from the same shop and same breed, and they also look similar so they're most likely siblings. But one has grown bigger than the other and eats more aggressively. The smaller one has recently been acting more skittish, and panics a lot.  In a result I think it may have injured its scales from the decor. I heard scales heal pretty quickly so I want to make sure I might be overreacting. But if it's not the case, I set up a quarantine tank next to the main just incase. The wounds however, have made the lager koi chase the smaller one more than usual-even biting the other's fins and the area of the wounds. They are probably too domesticated to shift to a pond, but I've also been planning to build one next year.  So are these injuries serious (images)? And can an aquarium Koi shift to a pond koi?     "
1509,How do I get Skin off my untamed baby leopard gecko?? HELP,"So I got a juvenile leopard gecko named Scout about 3 days ago. I haven't held him yet because I wanted him to get comfortable in his new home before I did that. He had just finished shedding a bit before when we got him, but he still has little ""socks"" on his toes. I was told to put him in a warm shallow bath, but he's not tamed yet and happens to hate water. what can I do to get it off but not make him uncomfortable?? "
1510,Why did my Guppies not grow for 8 months?,"I've bought a few adult guppies around ~ 9 months ago.  One of which was pregnant and gave birth around a few days after I got her I had kept the adult and the fry in the same container (Simple glass tank, no filter, shown in picture)   Now my concerns are as follows:   It appears that some of them have not grown at all, it has been approximately 8-9 months! Is the container (Meaning no filter) okay to keep them in? maybe getting a different tank with built in filter recommended?    And in general I'd like to ask if anyone has any tips raising guppies since I've been reading up a lot but there was nothing said about their growth rate being so erratic. "
1511,My kittens keep fighting!!,"About a month ago we bought our kitten ( Missy ) she's a really playful girl, a little bit to playful. She was forever biting us and scratching, running around the room, she can't go out for another 3 months as she's not neutered, so we thought we should buy another kitten so she has another playmate, in the hope she would stop biting us !  We bought our new kitten ( Scoobie ) yesterday, we bought a male as they are supposed to get on better this way.  I will admit, we didn't introduce them correctly, we just sat the down together and hoped for the best, we separated them at night however.  Our new little scoobie is a couple weeks younger than Missy - Missy is around 12 weeks, Scoobie is about 9.  Scoobie is a very calm and loving cat, I think he is still in the sleepy kitten stage. I can't work out if Missy is trying to fight or play with Scoobie, but she has no boundries, so if Scoobie squeals a little she pulls back for a minute then continues.  What can we do? Missy is just to rough with Scoobie, but Scoobie still goes up to her wanting to play and interact, so he's not scared of her? However he can't catch a break as Missy won't leave him alone ! Only when he eats ( in a separate part to her) she allows it. Missy does bite and do that rabbit kick with her back legs on Scoobie, which we try to break up and distract Missy with toys ( which doesn't work ) We have tried to put them in separate rooms, mainly putting Scoobie in a room so Missy still has her 'house' but then Scoobie constantly cries and Missy almost forgets that Scoobie is in there so doesn't pay attention to the door or him!   I have read to leave them to it if they are hissing or boxing each other, but I get worried when little Scoobie makes a noise.   Do we start all over again and try to introduce them through the doors  "
1512,My kittens keep fighting?,"About 3 weeks ago we bought our Kitten Missy. She's very playful, and we find it hard to get her to know when it's hurting when she bites or scratches. We decided to buy her a playmate.  We brought scoobie into the family yesterday.  Missy is 12 weeks, scoobie is around 9 weeks and is quite a bit smaller. We didn't Introduce them as she should of (our mistake).  They seem okay together,  as they sleep next to each other and they eat together. But missy is overally playful and won't leave scoobie alone when he doesn't want to play.  I don't know if Missy is trying to fight or trying to play?  She uses her back legs and kicks scoobie, which Is when we have to break it up, as he makes noises at her. Not in a squeal, but a ""get off me"" noise, and missy just doesn't understand. She doesn't know when to stop or to calm down.  Is there anything we can do so she can understand when she's being to rough? Should we separate them more?  Scoobie is a very loving and playful cat, but he doesn't quite no how to stand up to Missy, so he lies on the floor most of the time with Missy kickin and biting him!   I don't interfere when they are chasing each other or play fighting. But when Scoobie makes the noises, I don't know if she's in pain or warning Missy?   Please help!  I'm happy she has a playmate, but I don't want her to hurt him!  "
1513,Can I use an unused bath as a litter box?,"I have an extra bathroom which no one in the house uses, we put our cat's litter box in it. I love cats alot so I was thinking if I ended up adopting alot of them (being able to take care of them all of course) can I use the extra bath (if pluged really good with a bath plug) as a litter box? I'm thinking of filling it with alot of litter that it won't need changing for at least 2 months or so.  If I won't allow guests to ever see it and make sure to plug it real well with a bath plug. What are the positives and negatives of having a bath as a litter box(if cleaned daily)? Thank you. "
1514,Bunny left outside now experiencing problems,"My mom left my bunny ( 10 weeks old) outside for about 4 hours tempature being around 86°F anyways and when I went for it, its mouth was wet and its two front paws I have no idea how it got wet.  also when I went to pick it up it started to kick and jump mind you it has never done this before but I brought him in and now he is acting strange and laying weird ( attached pictures) also when he walks or hops he doesn't move positions and I have no idea what to do does anyone know? Should I take him to the vet or what?  Please help I'm worried.    "
1515,"Auto feeder: do cats need a bowl for their kibble, or is gathering from floor ok?","TLDR; I need to portion-feed my cat as he loves food too much. I made a feeding machine that is mounted out of reach, which means the kibble falls down and scatters on the floor, where he has to go around gathering it. Is this OK for a cat, or is not having his food in a bowl stressful?  Longer story: When we got our cat from the shelter he was 8 kilos (17.6 pounds) so we feed him a fixed amount of kibble a day (prescribed by our vet) trying to get it down (which works, he's now around 6 kilos).  We used to feed him about three times a day: ~1/3 in the morning, ~1/3 when we get home and ~1/3 in the evening.  A problem we're having is how he likes to wake us extremely early (somewhere between 4 and 6 in the morning) because he is hungry. So I made a small feeding machine that will dispense his food, starting at half past 5 in the morning. It will dispense 1/4 of his food every 5 hours (so 5:30, 10:30, 15:30 and 20:30), as I read cats like to eat smaller portions during the day, instead of just one big one. (In the beginning it would give out smaller portions every hour, but I got the feeling this was too disruptive for him: by the time he settled down after eating and started taking a nap, he'd hear his new food falling and would start eating again.)  So this works great in the morning: when he hears the machine he jumps off the bed and goes downstairs to eat, without waking us. Afterwards he comes back to the end of the bed for some more sleep.  I can't put the machine on the ground because I'm sure with his determination to eat, he will destroy it. So at the moment it's mounted underneath one of the shelves we made for him to climb on and the kibble will just fall down and scatter and he has to go around that part of the room to get all of it. Do I have to find some way to get the kibble into a neat bowl, or is it OK for him to have to gather them? It does seem to help against eating too fast (because he has to search for some of them) and he seems happy enough (because food). But could this be stressful for him?  PS: He can get as much water as he wants. There is a bowl in nearly every room (away from his food so it doesn't fall in) that we change every day.  Update: Before, I made a cardboard contraption with different holes and slots to put his food in so he has to search for it. I was thinking of making a larger, wooden one (like this: [website]update 2: The 'machine' I made is an auger with a container on top for the kibble. A servo motor on the back turns the auger so kibble comes out. On the back is an ESP8266 board (basically a tiny computer with wifi) that connects to my home wifi so I can tell it to move and for how long. This is done automatically at set times, but I can also use my phone to trigger it. On the top you can see a wider part, which slides into a holder that is attached to the bottom of my shelf. The parts are 3D printed. It's a prototype so it still has some exposed wires in the back. This one is printed using PLA but I'm going to make another one out of a verified food-safe material.  "
1516,Do all female cats have longer fur around their abdomen rather than around the rest of their body?,"My cat has regular short fur around her body but at her abdomen (more like at her bladder) she has longer fur, a family member told me it's because she is becoming a grown up by the days and the long fur around her abdomen is their to protect her abdomen more, because her body is getting ready for mating and pregnancy procedures. My cat is a mixed breed so I'm thinking it can be due to the admixture of breeds she's brought up to have.  So do all female cats have longer fur at their abdomen rather than the rest of their body? Or is it probably because she is a mixed breed?    You can see the fur around her bladder part is like floating, while the rest of her body has shorter fur. "
1517,Are retractable leashes hazardous enough to prohibit use if used responsibly by the pet owner?,"Are there any dangers that a user of retractable leashes should know about that don't involve misuse by the owner and/or can't be prevented by responsible owner use?  I've heard plenty of horror stories about accidents that can happen from the use of retractable leashes, but many of them could also happen while using a regular leash.  Is there something I'm missing about the dangers? "
1518,Helping my dog through a breakup,"My girlfriend and I have been having some troubles lately, and I'm pretty sure we're going to break up in the next month. Does anyone have any suggestions for how to best help my dog through the separation?  My dog is 8, but I've only had her for about 8 months. My dog is used to my girlfriend staying most nights a week at my place and usually seems to be in a worse mood for at least day after my gf leaves to stay at her place.   My girlfriend has basically been her second parent since the beginning and is definitely her favorite of the 2 of us. I'm really worried about how she'll adjust to having just me around.   Any suggestions on easing the transition?  "
1519,What is the best shape for a cat's food bowl?,"I have noticed that while my cat eats, he has trouble getting his food pellets into his mouth, perhaps because of the shape of the food bowl? The food bowl I use is a small, circular, flat bottomed dish with 2 inch side rims -- pretty standard.   Has anyone done research on the most comfortable food bowl shape for cats? "

1521,How to get dog's attention?,"Very likely to be a duplicate, but was unable to find similar question.  I have a 8mo Corgi/Toy Australian Shepard puppy for about 3 months already. He's doing well with the SIT command. However, I have a problem with teaching him not to pull the leash. I've tried two strategies: short leash and ""pull->stop"" or ""pull->change direction""...  As I understand, the root of the problem is lack of attention. He's always looking around, sniffing everything he finds etc. How do I capture his attention when we start a training session? Should my puppy be hungry enough before we go for a walk? Will treats work in this case (he seems to be food motivated). Will I have a problem of him trying to eat everything he finds (I already observe something very similar even he's fed). Another potential problem is that I have a lack of authority for him. How do I build it? "
1522,If my pet is lactose intolerant does that mean they can't have any dairy products?,"According to Wikipedia most mammals stop producing or decrease production of Lactase after weening.       Lactase is essential to the complete digestion of whole milk. Lactase breaks down lactose, a simple sugar which gives milk its sweetness. Lacking lactase, a person consuming dairy products may experience the symptoms of flatulence, diarrhea &amp; nausea   In general how concerned do I need to be?  If my pet is lactose intolerant does that mean they can't have any dairy products? "
1523,How often should one wash a pet's (dog or cat) food bowl?,Should it be washed every time they empty the food bowl? Every few days? Does it depend on the species? Are there any dangers to not washing the food bowl at a more regular time than the recommended? 
1524,Concerned about allergies: can I give my chinchilla rabbit foods or treats?,"I have read that pine shavings are generally considered safe for animals, but not as safe for chinchillas. This link says that aspen also isn't good for some chinchillas - ""Spruce is an another acceptable wood shaving if you want to stick with wood but aren't using aspen for some reason, such as an allergic response to it in your chinchilla."" Can I give my chinchilla some foods or treats that are labeled for rabbits? I have discovered some foods he likes, but I'm worried about allergies.  So, generally what are chinchillas allergic to? Is giving him rabbit foods going to cause a reaction? "
1525,Why is my Staffordshire Terrier losing hair around his mouth?,My 6 year old Staffordshire Terrier is losing hair around his mouth. This has happened before except he lost all the hair around his right eye. The vet took a scraping and there were no increased mites or abnormalities. I love him dearly but my budget is tight.   Is this the same thing? Can I prevent it somehow? 
1526,"Should I cheer my puppy when he stops doing a bad thing after I command him ""NO!""?","Will it confuse my puppy if I first say ""NO!"" when he's doing something bad and after that cheer him?

1527,How can I tell if a cat is depressed?,"My cat is awake most of the night, when none of the family is, and asleep -- seemingly resigned -- during most of the day. I feel sorry for him. Wouldn't he be lonely at night?   He used to like playing with toys, but not so much anymore. Now, he mostly just likes to lie down underneath the coffee table. I don't know what he thinks about.  He used to be a social cat. He loves being around people. He's still social, but I feel like I don't have any chances to interact with him, apart from when I pull out the treat bag, or when it's time for food. Apart from that, we just sit and stare at each other, and occasionally touch.  Could he be depressed? "
1528,"If my pet has a litter, should I avoid getting my scent on the babies?","I think answers to this question can be agnostic of pet species. So I am asking the general question, if my pet who is member of my family has a litter should I avoid touching them and getting my scent on them? If so for how long should I avoid touching them?   I have heard that if you touch a wild baby animal it's mother may reject it, and your touch may lead to the babies death.  Does the same apply to baby pets?   "
1529,Is it safe to store bird seed in plastic trash bags? (Inside those big yellow cat litter bins),"My wife loves her bird feeders. The problem with this is that we either store bird seed outside and the birds get to it, making a big paper mess, or we store it inside. Storing it inside, we have to worry about kicking around a big bag of bird seed (Storage space is at a premium at our house, so it has to sit by the back door). I'm thinking it wouldn't be a bad idea to store the seed in trash bags inside one of those big yellow plastic cat litter tubs.  The question here is it safe for the birds? I'm vaguely aware that some plastics are not food safe and will seep toxins, and neither trash bags nor kitty litter boxes seem like good candidates for manufacturers to test against for food safety. If regular trash bags are an issue, is there any sort of material that is safe for this type of storage? "
1530,Why is it important to clean a tortoise's shell?,"I have this tortoise ""Jabuti"" (Red-footed tortoise), for like 20 years, his shell was never cleaned because he always lived in the garden with mud. I have read about tortoise care suggesting to clean their shell, but why? Do people tend to be hygienic about their pets? "
1531,Motion-induced dizziness in cats,"Humans can become dizzy by spinning around quickly. Small children will occasionally do this on purpose, for the thrill.  However, intentional dizziness inducing behavior is (as far as I am aware) never observed in cats or kittens. (Although I did see a particularly spectacular quadruple spin after one of my kittens collided with another in midair.) It would also be harder to observe the effects of dizziness as cats are quadrupedal and so are more stable than bipedal humans.  According to some not-always-reliable sources on the internet (such as Yahoo Answers or YouTube), cats can become dizzy, but recover from it much more rapidly than humans; but these accounts appear to be merely anecdotal, with others reporting the opposite, that despite their attempts they have been unable to induce observable dizziness in their cats.  It is a known fact that cats can become dizzy due to things like ear infections or medication side-effects, and that motion can aggravate it (link), so it would seem plausable that a cat could become dizzy by spinning fast enough for long enough even in absence of those factors. However, I can't find any non-sketchy sites that give a clear answer about this.  Can cats become dizzy due to spinning, in absence of disease or other special circumstance? How quickly do they recover from dizziness compared to humans? "
1532,How can I help a arthritic cat who is peeing outside of the box?,"My 14 year old cat was diagnosed with arthritis last August over the pelvic area and spine. Unfortunately for the past month he has been peeing all over the place. I have tried all sorts of things to help his situation such as having several litter boxes which are completely flat, appropriate food and giving him vitamins for his joints. I also got him groomed as he no longer cleans himself, this was suggested by our vet. At this stage I don't know what to do that might help reduce the peeing part as he no longer uses any of the litter boxes. Any suggestions please?  Or could it be something else, such as kidney failure? :( "
1533,how do i get my dog and a kitten to be friends?,"I have a German Shepard, not always ferocious but he seriously hates this kitten that comes in the backyard. He even tried attacking it.  The kitten is still small, knows to run around though.No one among the neighbors are willing to take the kitten in. I would want to take it but i have Bruno too.  Can i ever expect these two to be good to each other ? what can I do that Bruno stops hating the kitten? "
1534,How often should a dog pee and poop normally?,"Some articles I have found say it's 3-5 times a day, some say 2-3 times a day with no more than 8-12 hours between times when dog gets out.  My mother's dog (English Springer Spaniel) is used to being taken out 2 times a day. 7-8 in the morning and ~11 in the evening. He only poops in the morning. He seems to be used to this schedule, he does not seem too needy in morning and evening.  I guess my question is, is twice a day not enough and is this hurting the dog in the long run?  Or should I convince my mother that 3 times are needed? "
1535,My Guppy & Betta fish ignore cucumber,"To be honest I was a bit suprised  when I heard that fish can eat cucumber, I though it's a joke till I watched it with my own eyes on youtube ([website]There 10 total fish in my aquarium   2 betta (one is bigger male and another one is smaller, I don't know it's female or male, tough) 8 teen guppies   I want my fish to eat cucumber too ( usually I feed them with pellets).

1536,How to move an aquarium?,"When one wants to move an aquarium (say within 10 minutes walking/carrying distance, but answers with hint for long distance (> 1 day travelling in a car) are welcome as well), there probably things to consider regarding the well being of inhabitant and potential damage of the aquarium (be it during the transport or non-visible long term damage (microfissure, breaking silicone joints)). What precautions have to be taken? How long do I have to plan in advance? "
1537,Shearing our Golden Retriever with Sheep Shears,"I'm a bit embarrassed to say this, but our dog has a persistent ringworm problem. Several times throughout the years, we'd apply Viaderm or something that can be bought from our local vet. Then, when she'd (it's a she) stop itching so much and we'd used up all her Viaderm, we'll stop treating her. Then her ringworm comes back. I guess through the years, her number of spots with infection has only increased.  What I'm thinking now is to treat her for good. We'd shave her bald then apply the Viaderm for weeks. We've tried shaving her last year (or was it 2 years ago??), but it was a tedious task -- it's a thick curly fur, and you could hardly call her bald. So I was thinking of using a sheep shear. "
1538,Three kittens (2 weeks) want to train to front carrier (like Baby Bjorn but for cats),"I have been planning to adopt a kitten and train it to a front carrier backpack so I can take it when I travel (within the same state). I have just been asked to adopt three very young kittens (when they are weaned). How would I manage the same feat with two or three? Is it fair to them for me to even try?  For that matter, what age should I start to train them and when should I take them from their mother? The mother is a feral cat who has settled temporarily in my daughter 's backyard.  "

I'm using a felt playmat with a road map design. Will this be harmful in any way to my cavies? or will they enjoy it? "
1540,Hair loss on stray cat's head behind ears,"There are two stray cats (around 6-7 months old I guess) near my house. I often feed them boiled chicken or cooked egg yolk. About 10 days ago I started giving them Whiskas Dry Kitten Food.   Few days ago I observed a hair loss small spot on one of the cat's head (Zag). And now it has grown in size.  I tried to look for fleas or ticks but couldn't find much, as he doesn't allow me to search through his hair a lot. There's a similar small stripe like spot on his body, but it's small in size now. I know ideally I'm supposed to take Zag to the Vet, but being a student I'm really low on budget. Also I can't take them in because of my apartment issues.  Is it possible that he might be having an allergy to the cat food? His brother (Zig) is fine and has no such signs of hair loss. They sleep together most of the times, so if it would have been an infection it should have spread to his brother too, right? Zag's behaviour is pretty normal he plays a lot and grooms himself too. On the contrary, once I started feedinng Zig catfood he has become more playful.  I would be grateful if anyone having any clue about such hair loss pattern could tell me what it could be.  Thanks     Zig (His Brother)  "

1543,"Adult Golden Doodle needs to stay home alone for 10 hours on weekdays, having trouble with accidents","I recently moved an hour away from my job, my 5 year old male Golden Doodle is house trained, he never has accidents when I'm home nor did he while I was at work before I moved, but now that I'm gone for 2-3 more hours at a time he sometimes pees in the house before I get home. I tried putting him in the bathroom during the day (with his bed and toys and everything... can you tell I feel bad about it?) but he would still pee on the floor in there too. It's just too long for him, of course I take him out before I leave in the morning and right when I get home but some days it's close to 11 hours that I'm gone for.  What's the best way to handle this? I know if he were more confined like in a crate he would likely be able to hold it (rather than pee on himself or where he has to lay) but that seems cruel. I can't have him ruining my house, it's already starting to ruin the flooring and I had to throw away my rug. "
1544,Want to buy sofa for living room. What to do about cats?,"I want to buy a new sofa for our living room. After I buy it, I'm 100% sure my cats will also want to sit in the new sofa and sharpen their nails in the new sofa and ruin the new sofa. I've talked to them about the issue, but they seem to ignore me.  I guess my question is: What type of sofa should I buy to minimize this? Or what can I do so that they stay away from the sofa? IS there a specific material that cats particularly dislike?  The living room doesn't have a door, so closing the area off is not an option. I also prefer not having to spray the sofa. "
1545,Replacing gravel plants and ornaments in fish tank,"I’m looking to remove all my old gravel, ornaments and plants and replacing with new ones, including a new filter.

1546,Can I get rabies from a stray puppy,  I adopted a stray puppy about 2months old. The mom was abandoned near our home our neighbor took in the mom. He likes nipping clothes and shoe ties and I'm worried if I get bitten. Can I get rabies from it? Should I get rabies prevention shot?  
1547,Deaf cat screaming to get attention,"My sister has 2 cats and one is deaf.  Every time the other one wants our attention (mostly when she wants to get out or she's bored), she meows constantly. It's not loud, just a little annoying.  But the deaf cat screams, literally. It's really load and disturbing. It drives me and others CRAZY--not kidding, I get evil thoughts. (I don't think she screamed the first year.)  I looked up her behavior on Google; most sites said the best thing is to ignore them until they quit the habit. The problem is my family, they won't listen. Every time she starts screaming, somebody pets her or gives her a little push so she will shut up, but she starts again after couple minutes. The other day this went on for 5 hours.  Question: What can I do besides ignoring her to get her to quit screaming every time she wants something? is there a training trick or something?  Edit:   This cat is about 2 years old, she was deaf from the beginning and we take her to a vet every month. She started screaming about 4 or 6 months ago.  "
1548,Found this skink in my tomato plant bucket. Is he trapped? Or could he leave if he wanted?,"I've been growing some tomatoes in a 5 gallon bucket. About 4 days ago, I found this skink sitting there in the dirt. .  Since he's been there, he's been happily just burrowing around in the dirt and (probably) eating some bugs. He's totally welcome to stay as long as he wants, I think he's pretty neat. My concern is, I read skinks aren't that great at climbing, unlike geckos. If he wanted to leave the bucket, would he be able to? Or do I need to catch him and set him free? "
1549,"Correct identification of ""adult dog weight"" when using dry food","I have a little zwergpinscher and we are using dry food. There is a table to identify proper amount of food for day. It depends on weight of adult dog, but it's not obvious how to detect it. I thought that it means average weight for breed, which is 6kg for pinscher. But it seems that it is to much for my puppy. Should i interpret ""weight of adult dog"" as weight of MY dog? And change daily food amount depending on it? "
1550,What is the best way to keep lawn alive with two big dogs?,"I'm about to move into a brand new house with a brand new lawn and I have some concerns... First of all, I want to be able to leave my dogs outside when I go to work, but they will dig. (And I know all about waking them and playing with them and getting enough exercise and giving them toys, etc, you don't need to tell me. It doesn't matter how much I exercise them, they have a seemingly unlimited amount of energy... They're tamaskans, so they are highly intelligent and get bored easily too even though they have like a million kong toys, stuffed animals, bones, and rawhide ...). I've considered making them a sandbox, but I can see the sand slowly migrating out of the box since they will definitely be throwing it everywhere when digging... I'm thinking about putting down chicken wire. My first question is - would it be better to put it under the turf (I was told that the grass won't be rooted by the time I move in so I can lift it and place the wire if I want) or just on top of the grass? I hear it will sink into the soil and get covered by grass so it won't be visible anyways. My second question is - how much and when should I water? It gets hot in Texas. I have a sprinkler system so I can just set up a schedule. I read that is better to water deeply 2-3 times a week early in the morning (why not at night?). But because I have big dogs who will pee on the grass every day, I wonder if I should water more often but in smaller amount to prevent burn spots? But then internet also says that watering often will result in shallows grass roots that will require more water to stay alive. Any thoughts appreciated. "
1551,Why did my betta’s fins grow back curly?,"I purchased my half moon about 3 months ago with some fin rot anddull color. This little guy’s fins grew back white and curly and just recently got color. Attached is the progress photos with time frames. I have been doing mirror time with him to try and strengthen them daily, but it doesn’t seem to help, he has a cycled tank with two 25% water changes weekly and the filter gets turned off during the day. He gets pellets every morning and brine shrimp or bloodworms for dinner during the week, pellets on the weekend and eats like a champ. I check the pH of both of my tanks weekly.  Is this normal? Will his fins ever become straight again? Is he sick? Or am I jusy being a crazy fish mom? TIA!!! "
1552,Why does my African Clawed Frog keeps banging into the tank glass and pawing at the corners with his front feet?,I just recently got an african clawed frog  which I rescued from being dissected. He used to live in a large plastic bin with 3 other frogs and sometimes I'd see them nipping at each other. He keeps pawing at the aquarium glass an both ends especially at corners and will sometimes frantically bang into the tank over and over almost like he's trying to get through to the other side? He does it all the time. At first I thought he was just trying to find more room to swim and wishes his tank was bigger or that he had bad eyesight. But it's starting to worry me. He seems unhappy. Is he just attacking his reflection? Should I check for illness?

She went through emergency surgery for pyometra (a uterine infection) 3 days ago (Wednesday, Jan. 29th, 2014) and ever since then, she hasn't eaten anything.   Just about an hour ago, she threw up greenish fluid and start frothing.   Should I be worried?  What do I do?  "
1555,How can I teach my kitten not to steal the other kitten's food?,"I have two kittens, not from the same litter. The older kitten is 5 months old, and I have had her for 3 months. The younger kitten (not even half the size) is 3 months old and I have had her for 2 months. The older kitten was already quite a bit bigger than the younger kitten when the younger kitten joined us. No, it is not the older kitten stealing the food!  Younger kitten suddenly morphs into what I call ""piglet-face"" as soon as she realizes it's time for wet food. She gulps it back as though she hasn't eaten in days, and then beelines for older kitten's food the instant she's finished hers. There are two bowls of dry food out at all times, so she is not starving because she is eating that regularly throughout the day. Older kitten has never tried to get at her food while she's eating, in fact, older kitten eats very slowly and calmly, likes to eat some and come back for the rest later, and when younger kitten comes and shoves her face into older kitten's bowl, she makes no attempt to stop her, just sits there looking put-out. Older kitten does not act passively like this in other situations though (playing, lap-sharing, etc), she has no problem standing up for herself, or just being plain saucy, then.  Younger kitten does not have worms, so it isn't that (older kitten was actually very dirty with loads of fleas and really bad worms when I got her, but got rid of them before younger kitten joined us).  I have tried putting older kitten's bowl in a higher spot away from the usual food area, but this seems to put her off her food a bit (maybe it seems like punishment?) and younger kitten gets it anyway. I have tried putting younger kitten in the bathroom with her food until older kitten has finished hers, but like I said, older kitten likes to eat her wet food in 2-4 different goes, so not fair to younger kitten if she is locked in the bathroom that whole time (plus the litter box is in there, so it means older kitten would also be locked away from litter box...just doesn't work).  Is there any way I can teach younger kitten to slow down and/or stop stealing older kitten's food? Or teach older kitten not to let her food be stolen? Or just some suggestions for eating arrangements so everyone gets to eat their own food? "
1556,What is this dull patch on my bearded dragon?,I noticed today that my bearded dragon has a dull-looking patch on her back. Does anyone know what might have caused this?  Is she sick?  I'm very concerned.  Any info would be greatly appreciated.   
1557,"Should you pet a bird, and if so, how?","Do birds respond to petting, like cats and dogs do?  Do they like being gently brushed against their heads?  Does grooming in this sense exist in the avian world? "
1558,Is it a good idea to buy fish online rather than from a local pet store?,I'm very new to keeping fish as pets. I was surprised to find out that you can order fish online and have them shipped. Is there any way to be sure that the fish will be healthy? Should I just stick to local stores? 
1559,Cockatiel going into tight spaces and getting angry,"My cockatiel got into the habit of going into tight spaces and getting angry there.  She goes into the cupboard, clothes dryer, climbs into any pots or dishes that are around, or just squeezes inbetween my thigh and the arm of the sofa.  When she's in closed spaces like this, she gets angry when I put my hand near her, or sometimes even if I just go close to her.  She hisses, fans out the tail and sometimes screams at me.  As soon as I remove her from the closed space, she's a friendly bird again.  The bird started doing this maybe 5 month ago or so.  She's 18 months old now.  We used to put her into the cupboard often before, because she would stay put and play happily with bread tags in there while we were doing something else in the kitchen (usually washing dishes in front of the same cupboard).  It's difficult to get some work done with a bird that keeps following you around and always poking her beak into whatever you're doing, so it was convenient.  After she started getting angry in such places, we didn't let her go there any more, and we're trying to not let her into tight spaces in general.  Though the cupboard is still her favourite place and she'd try to fly inside whenever it's open.  (Second favourite are all kinds of pots or bowls.)  Questions: Why does the bird do this, and in particular, is this usual / common behaviour for cockatiels?  Is this some kind of nesting instinct and is it related to sexual behaviour?  What can I do to avoid it?  Fortunately the bird can't help obeying the step up command if my voice is insistent enough, so usually I manage to remove her from the cupboard without getting bitten.  Once she's out everything's back to normal. "
1560,My rabbit is hyperventilating and can't get comfortable. What is wrong with her?,"I am back from the ER, the rabbit seems okay right now; but I'm still concerned that there might be something wrong with her.  Here is a video of her in hyperventilating and unable to get comfortable.  My presence makes her a bit less shifty than when I first noticed her; but once I re-adjust the camera you can kind of get an idea of how she was acting.    The time line  ~16:20 EST:    One of my free range rabbits starts following me around to indicate he'd like some kibble, after a minute or two I give in, scoop up the kibble.  Surprisingly my other rabbit seems unaware of what's going on and I need to flag her down to get her attention.  She acts a bit confused for a few seconds, but then catches on and  flies up to the top level (4 floors) of the condo quicker than I can dispense the kibble.  I note to my girlfriend how I've never seen her move that fast.  ~16:35 EST:  The caged guinea pig in the living room that we adopted 3 weeks ago starts to wheet, and I decide to give it some Romaine lettuce.  I take a few extra leaves over to the rabbits.  My female rabbit refuses the lettuce which is highly unusual.   16:50 EST: I notice my female rabbit is acting strange and throws her self into the corner litter pan, which almost never gets used because it's highly exposed and doesn't have great access to hay.  This is quite odd, my female rabbit (unlike the make) never lays or roots in the litter pans.  Upon closer inspection, I notice that her breathing is more than twice her normal rate (hard to see in the video due to the frame rate).  I watch her for several minutes as she struggles to get comfortable, and keeps kicking the back of the liter pan because she is unable to fully stretch out in it.  After a few minutes of this it becomes clear she isn't playing, or scared of me or something in the house.   I try to console her, it doesn't help, and seems to make her switch positions. I back off and call for the girlfriend, who agrees, there's something seriously wrong.   I struggle with what to do; she looks like she might have a heart attack; a car ride to the vet could make it worse.  16:48 EST: I decide she needs to see a vet, but that I need a video of her behavior before I go.  I call the ER in case they can give me some advice; the person who answers is almost useless, and for some reason thinks I'm talking about a cat when I clearly opened with ""my pet rabbit is hyperventilating"" after waisting 4 more minutes to determine that this person is incapable of pulling up my rabbits medical files (we always take her there) I'm able to hang up.  17:10 EST: I gather both rabbits into their carrier (oddly the male puts up no fight whereas he NEVER lets me pick him up, he must somehow understand the severity of the situation).  My female tosses and turns after being placed in the carrier.  17:38 EST: I arrive at the medical center, and have to wait in line behind 2 people at the emergency counter  17:45 EST: One of the 4 people at the main (non-ER) desk recognizes the queue and asks if we are all there for emergency, we all say yes.  This spurs one of the other people there to call the person in front of me to their counter a minute later.  17:53 EST:  I'm annoyed that I'm still in line; the person being served in front of me has been has been at the counter for 15 minutes, and it's clear her problem might not even be urgent, let a lone an emergency.  I decide to unzip the carrier to verify my rabbit is actually still alive, thankfully she is.  Her breathing has slowed, but is still faster than normal.  I place my hand under the carrier to better support her and feel her shiver for about 2.5 seconds then stopped, then repeated again about every 5-10 seconds.  18:03 EST: The person in front of me finally look like they are finishing up payments and other administrative things and begins reaching for her suitcase.  About 2 minutes later she pulls out a black trash bag with a cat inside. A minute later the receptions phones for someone to pick up a 'DOA cat'.  My confidence in the hospital begins to fade.  18:05 EST: I can finally rest my carrier on the counter and get a better look at my rabbit as I begin to check her in.  I can visibly she her tremble / shiver.  The receptionist immediately realizes she should call someone up front to determine if my rabbit should be triage.  We continue the check-in process and for some reason they again struggle to pull up my rabbit's records. After 5 minutes, the receptionist recognizes that no one has come to access the rabbit yet, and calls again for someone.    18:12 EST Finally some one qualified comes to check out the rabbit.  She of course doesn't notice her shiver, just her breathing.  After questioning me about the last time she ate, decides she's ""stable enough"", and my check in process continues for another 2 minutes.  ~18:40 EST An on staff vet meets me in the waiting area, and brings me to a examination room.  My rabbit is still shaking at this point, but breathing is almost normal.  She does seem a bit more confused than usual.  After explaining the situation, the doctor asked if she'd any trouble breathing or small poops.  I noted that she had been having slightly smaller poops that we attributed to trying to introduce her to the guinea pig over 20 hrs ago, and that at ~04:00 EST she had done what sounded like a sneeze followed by 5 coughs, which was unusual for her.  The doctor asked me to send her the video I had taken (posted above), and to take the rabbit to the exotics area where she'll preform the examination since it will be more quiet.  ~19:00 EST The doctor returns with my rabbit and says she seems fine now.  Indeed, all symptoms are gone.  The doctor tells me she wasn't sure what was wrong, perhaps she was just afraid.  I told her this wasn't likely as she's one of the most people tolerant rabbits I've ever had, and explained I thought it was pain or neurology related.  She agreed and listed a bacterial cause, lead poising and gas as possible culprits, but said there wasn't any evidence of physical harm.  She prescribed the usual regiment of metoclopramide, pain killers and critical care and recommended that I pick up some simethicone from a regular pharmacy and feed her 1 ml to treat gas.  She went on to tell me how their exotic vet would be on staff tomorrow if I felt I needed her to see someone who knew more about rabbits.  19:25 EST I bring the rabbit back into the house.  When released from the carrier, she immediately begins to gorge on hay.      I'm glad my rabbit seems to be alright now, but obviously, my confidence in the hospital has been shaken a little by my experience.  Has anyone seen rabbit behavior like this before?  Could she really have E. cuniculi, or could have it really been just gas pains?  Is there anything else it should have been? Perhaps something the guinea pig gave her?    I'm doubtful about the lead poising as she had it before and the symptoms were much different.    I'm trying to determine weather she should be brought to the specialist tomorrow.    Further, it would be nice to have a plan if this were to ever happen again in the future. Should I just feed her some simethicone instead of heading to the hospital, or perhaps I should call around and try to find an ER with an exotic vet on staff next time even if that means driving an 1.5 hrs instead of 20 min.    Update: about 2 months later my other rabbit choose the same potty to exhibit very similar behavior, though he acted a little less frantic, perhaps because he's overall more fearful of people and was likely to be trying harder to hid it.  With my other rabbit it also seemed a bit more evident that it was stomach related and not neurological.  The exotics vet wasn't on call that night so we fed him metacloprmide for 12 hrs.  He seemed to be in less pain in the morning, so we kept going. About 18 hrs later he was back to normal. "
1561,What is the shelf life of metoclopromide (Reglan)?,"I have metoclopromide (Reglan) oral solution in my rabbit first aid kit.  It should be dispensed in a light-resistant, Tightly sealed container and stored at room temperature. It has been suggested that the shelf life of the product is fairly short.  But I am unable to find any reliable references discussing how often it should be replaced.  Is there any published information on how long the drug will remain viable? "
1562,Is Royal Canin veterinary diet for dogs better than regular diet?,"My young puppy (4 months old) is quite healthy as of today, but my vet mentioned that Royal Canin has veterinary diet kibble for dogs with no clinical problems.  Now he's eating Royal Canin Medium for puppies (he's a pure breed Brittany Spaniel).  Does anyone have experience with the veterinary diet food? Does it improve the overall diet? "
1563,What time of day to feed our adult dogs?,"Our dogs are four and six years old. We have been feeding them twice a day since each was one year old. Recently I came across a web page that argued quite well on the reasons why it is better to feed an adult dog only once a day. That text did not say (or I missed it) what would be a good time of day for feeding.  On this site I found an answer to another question (motionsickness in a car) where the answerer said ""an adult dog only needs to be fed once a day and this is usually, best done in the evening.""  Okay, we are now willing to change our routine and start feeding the dogs only once a day.  Why is evening better? The food we give our dogs is dry pellets, which in my imagination makes for easy digestion. Won't the dogs then have empty stomach by the next day and won't that make them restlessly looking for the next bowlful of food? My family is away from home during the day and I'd like our dogs to calmly rest that time. Wouldn't it be good to give them food in the morning before we leave for work and school? "
1564,Planted Nano Aquarium Experiment,"Material     several 750ml cylindrical glass containers: with and without top cap   different types of substrates: gravel (small to mid-size grains), sand and fertilized soil for aquarium (neutral Ph)   different types of plants: low maintenance and fast growth   different types of water: tap, filtered and distilled   different types of fertilizers: soluble, solid and ammonium hydroxide 25%   different types of light sources: 0.2~10W 3000K and natural sunlight     Experiment    Basically, the experiment consist of trying to find a configuration and a proper amount of light+fertilizers that would increase the lifespan of the plants. However, as much as I've tried (ex: 0~50ppm ammonia, 4~24hr/day light, ...), nothing seems to change the following pattern:     day 1: bubbles whenever there is enough light   day 2~4: less bubbles, plant as hole less green   day 5~7: leaf falling, first signs of algae   day 8~12: almost no bubbles, some parts of the plant are rot   day 13+: the plant is probably dead and algae blooms     Question    What am I missing? Any idea of what configuration might work?    &nbsp;  ps: Of course, the point of this experiment is to minimize the mistakes when going to a full tank. "
1565,"Cat has acute episodes of extreme ALT levels. Vet and we are at a loss as there's no obvious toxin access, looking for weird or uncommon ideas","We've been to a pretty good vet. We know the symptoms, but we just can't figure out what might be going on, or a cause. The vet says its serious and possibly life threatening, but he's at a loss what else it might be as well. I'll write what we know - any ideas, insights, suggestions for uncommon causes, weird or exceptional toxins, ideas sparked by the information, or anything else, would be helpful, to prevent recurrence.  The cat is about 10 years old, spayed female rescue, lived with us 5+ years, 5kg, rude good health apart from occasional bouts of stress cystitis (urinary stress diet + extra soup/water + cistaid given to counter this). Also pathologically misanthropic - her general view on humans is that apart from opening doors and providing food, they should all go away. But we love her anyway :)  First episode &amp; vet visit  About 2 months ago (25 April 2018) she had an acute episode of some kind of poisoning. She vomited a lot, but otherwise seemed fine all day. The next morning, over the course of 12 hours she went from ""off her food"" in the morning, to pretty much laid down and indifferent to everything waiting to die by afternoon, to the point of not even hissing, avoiding or clawing at human fingers near her face. Serious stuff for her.  We contacted the emergency vet hospital, who gave us some tips, and did some online research, and watched her a long time. She had no confusion, when pushed off the bed she didn't fail in co-ordination, no dilated pupils, tongue was very pale though.  We took her to the vet (well known to us, and competent). They identified a significant heart murmur (usual feline myopathy) in passing, did ultrasound and bloods, which confirmed no liver tumour or masses, no sign of internal bleeding, but general signs of gross insult/damage to the liver, some anaemia (25 on whatever scale is used in the UK) and off the scale for ALT (Alanine aminotransferase, an enzyme related to liver cell necrosis/toxicity: the level was 6000+ according to independent lab they asked to retest it. I gather usual is &lt; 100 ish?). She was so gone that the vet could take a blood sample from the neck without protest or sedation (when she recovered next week, the same vet couldn't even palpitate her stomach without risk of injury!). The conclusion was liver toxicity, and indeed the next afternoon she noticeably regained her appetite, and suddenly began to recover, and the episode ended. She was put onto beta blockers and thinners (Atenolol + Plavix) for the heart condition, and tolerated them, and all was well. A retest a week later showed ALT level had dropped to ~ 600 and the anaemia had ""resolved"".  Today's episode &amp; vet visit  This morning (2 June 2018) she was off her food. There hadn't been any vomiting, but she remained off food all day and by 4pm was once more showing the same signs as before - laid down, lethargic, and so on. We decided the risk was too great to leave overnight, and took her to the vet.   We arrived at 7pm, and he said at once it was serious and probably life-threatening. He expressed concern it might be internal haemorrhaging or a missed tumour, and redid the ultrasound, but there's no evidence of leakage or pooled liquid or other issues internally, and no masses in the liver or anywhere else he checked. Yet again ALT levels are sky-high - his machine goes up to 2000 and ALT is off the scale (he said done by a lab it could easily be 6000 or whatever), and anaemia is lower than last time, just 18 now, and the tongue is very pale. Most other levels are normal-ish, I gather. He didn't want to use a drip to address blood pressure as that would accentuate the anaemia issues, and said to stop giving the blood thinner until we know more, as well. We finally left about 9pm. In all, he saw her for almost 2 hours, compared to the usual 10-15 minute consultation.  We went through a bunch of possibilities but he said that the symptoms looks most like paracetamol poisoning - but that it doesn't fit that either. It could be an infection, except there's no other evidence and why would it go then return? It seems most likely she ate something - just inhaling even dust from a tablet wouldn't be enough, she would need to eat quite a lot to have this effect, and there just aren't any tablets around, and in 5 years we've never seen her scouring the floor for anything. She's in a flat (apartment) so she's isolated from any other cats and probably all/most pathogens they could carry. She has access to a terrace with some plants, but this doesn't resemble any plant poisoning he could suggest. The household products used aren't normally spilt, and those we do use he said would cause irritation, diahrrea, or vomiting, which we didn't see this time.  And.....  We're at a loss, and so is the vet. I'm staying up all night to watch her breathing, in case it worsens and she suddenly needs to go to the emergency hospital. I'm about 60/40 that she will be OK, but the fact it's happened twice and we can't think how, even after taking all the precautions we can think of against odd eventualities, is really a worry.  Like I said at the start - any thoughts, insights, suggestions or things missed, that this narrative sparks off, or that might be worth checking or considering, would be very welcome.  Updated information  Below are the actual lab/test results, maybe they help suggest ideas. I've highlighted anything marked as outside ""normal"" ranges. All units are metric (we're in the UK).

1566,Is my female guppy pregnant? About how far along if so. I just bought her a week ago,  I purchased this female guppy about a week ago and I think she’s pregnant. If she is how far along do you think she is? Is it true they will eat all of their babies?  
1567,Washing cat toys made of fabric/absorbent material,"I have some toy mice that are infused with catnip so the cats are really chewing on them. The toys are soaked through with their saliva.  How should I wash the toys when they are done? I understand that washing it will definitely reduce the effectiveness of the catnip, but I'm not overly concerned with that.  I am however concerned that using detergents or soaps may leave harmful chemicals. Also, soaps may leave smells that cats dislike and that would render the toy completely ineffective regardless of catnip.  What kinds of soap can/should I use? What are the chemicals in soaps that I must most definitely avoid? Can I use baking soda since it's odourless? "
1568,How do I check if a dog is vaccinated?,"I've started dog sitting, and am really enjoying it. One thing I'd like to know is the best way to check that a client's dogs are vaccinated.   Can I ask for the phone number of their vet, and expect the vet to tell me? Do I have to ask for documentation and check it myself?  what documents / vaccinations should I ask for? how do I tell the paperwork is up and up?  Thanks.  "
1569,Can a cat get a sexually transmitted disease?,"If my normally indoor cat mates with a feral cat, is it at risk of getting any diseases?    My cat has all of its vaccines up to date, so I suspect the only concern would be a sexually transmitted disease.  Inspired by a comment at the question Cat - How much time does anti-heat injections take to take effect? "
1570,"Cat missing part of tail, is that a problem with communication?","The other day I came across a cat that was missing about 20% of her tail, just the last part of if. It does not seem to be a problem with balance, but how (much) does a cat communicate with their tails towards other cats? Does a shorter tail introduce social problems?  For example, Ring-tailed lemur's need their tail for communication. "
1571,Cat - Fix poor coat,"My 1 year old male cat has poor coat and is shedding excessively. We feed him dry food and often wet food twice a month. I don't know what is lacking, we feed him good quality dry food. Our vet always suggests to change cat food whenever we pay a visit. We changed cat food twice but I don't think that is the reason. We sometime see progress in his coat and after a few days coat again becomes dull and dry. Is wet food necessary for coat? Is the dryness caused by feeding only dry food? Temperature reaches 40C in our city.  For testing purpose, I have started feeding him a little amount of wet food daily. Need your suggestions as I am tired of visiting vet that suggests change of food only. "
1572,What does it mean if my 5 year old cat isn't eating and has changed behavior?,"My cat is usually really social. Is all over you at night meowing and wanting attention. For the past few days, he spent the nights sleeping under the bench at the foot of the bed and doesn't come out, even for food and treats. Typically he eats so quickly that we have to keep him away from the other cats food!He doesn't want to go outside anymore, where normally he would cause havoc to be let out.  For reference, he is about five years old, an indoor/outdoor cat. I took him to the vet a few years ago and they noticed that he had a slightly enlarged heart.   What should I do? Is this a wait and see situation, or a call the vet in the morning one? "
1573,How to deal with a hell hound,"There was a time when we did not have any trouble with our dogs. We have a very responsible alpha male dog. One snarl will end any fights before it started. He has a friend, a gay dog. We found out he is gay because he loves to get humped on, and does not hump on a female dog.   The gay dog and the alpha male are both old buddies, so its no question the gay dog thought she was female, and the alpha male humps him. Even though we adopted 2 strays, 1 male and female. The alpha male and the gay dog are in control, there are no fights whatsoever even when food is concerned. And even though the female dog became mature, there are no fights still. No one mates the female, not even the alpha male.   Last month the alpha male died of sickness. The gay dog went to a serious depression, and we did too, because the alpha male was the best dog that we ever had, but we have to move on. We showed the dogs that we can make it through even without the alpha male, so we went on every day normally. Now we did own a stray male dog did we? Right now its like he stated himself as the Alpha male and then all hell broke lose.   That dog and the female became partners, starting last month, they hate baths when there was a time they don't mind it at all. We watched Ceasar Millan's videos on how to approach them, because we thought they became like that because of our action, maybe we are hurting them physically during bath time, so we tried to use gloves with soft cotton, but we just received snarls and even bites.   That's not all, during the time when the female was in heat, that alpha male dog becomes a hell hound. He bites the gay dog so hard, he even goes to the jugular vein. We use chokers to detach them, but when we all leave the house, we always return with the gay dog bruised. If you want to know what did the gay dog do to deserve such punishment from the hell hound? Absolutely nothing, the gay dog just sits there, then the attacks happen, there was even a time when the gay dog was just sleeping, then he was attacked!  Caging the hell hound is dangerous because there was a time that my mother tried to cage him and the dog bite my mothers hand, almost detaching the finger. She had to have stitches and operations to get the finger attached.   If you will think we are hurting the dogs during caging, we do not. Our procedure to put them in the cage is simple, open the cage, call their names and they should go inside the cage, we don't force them to go inside the cage.  So, right the family is deciding what to do with this dog, we are a family of 6, 2 of us agreed to kill the dog (Mom and I), 4 of them says no. But the dangerous dog keeps on rampaging the gay dog and us every day, so how do we deal with such dog? Are we right to think that we should kill it for the good of everyone?  What we did:  1) Normal Discipline - back then, when they snarl we say no. It somehow stops them, but now, not even loud noises can not stop the dog from snarling.  2) Throwing cold water during the fights - I think we saw something like to detach two dogs that are fighting, and discipline a dog, a bucket of water can be used so that we may not harm them physically, but that does not work, chokers do the job.  3) No Physical harm are done to the dogs (yet) - Because we know it is illegal, but if something ever happens to my mother again, that's another story.

1574,Sleeping cats in the bedroom,"Are cats that sleep with their owners at night in the bedroom a good idea? What are the pro's and cons?  I am not looking for anecdotes, but more health related. Aka, can it harm the owner or the pet, and why. "
1575,Phosphoethanolamine for dogs,Does anyone have experience giving Phosphoethanolamine for dogs? Ferreira et alli mention a concentration of 35 and 70 mg/kg in their study.  This would translate into 2 capsules for a dog weighing 20 kg. Does anyone know of potential side effects or contraindications for canines? 
1576,When to take your cat to an emergency vet?,"I was wondering what symptoms in a cat indicate it should be immediately seen by an emergency vet?  I know obviously if the cat has an injury, or is in obvious distress, but are there any less obvious ones? Like, for instance, I know head pressing is a sign of a serious neurological problem. Does that kind of thing warrant an emergency vet visit?  I was hoping for a decent list, so I have some idea in advance of an emergency when exactly it's time to go to the emergency vet versus just you can wait until the regular vet the next day.  "
1577,Mother cat won't care for her newborn kitten,"My cat Ylaya had her first babies two years ago. All of her kitten until now were/are inbreeding.  Her first litter was two cats, one of them was very sick and died. The other one (Yrwana) lived but died half a year later, the reason is not known.   About two weeks ago she had two babies, both premature, both died. Yesterday she got a baby again (Mini-Moi).   The problem is: She won't care for her baby, she hasn't done that with her first child either. I don't know what the problem is. Maybe Mini-Moi is sick and Ylaya knows that.  We have another cat (Mornie), who has just given birth to a beautiful healthy kitten (Namira, possibly inbred). Ylaya took care of Namira, because Mornie has lost a tooth and can't carry her child.   What can I do to keep the newborn cat alive? How do I get Ylaya to care of her kitten. How can I tell if the kitten is dying?  Edit: Mini-Moi died last night, as we expected.  "
1578,Moving to a house where a dog lived?,"We're moving to a new house in about a month.    The house has a white Labrador living there at the moment - I have no idea of the age, gender or temperament.  I don't know where in the house the Lab sleeps, but her bed was in the garage when we've visited for open days.  My dog Pete is a 6 year-old Bearded Collie crossed with Huntaway.  He's a neutered male, and while he used to chew things and dig as a puppy, he hasn't done that for a long time.   Pete sleeps on a low mattress in our combined living/dining room.  Question: What do I need to do or prepare for when we move in?  Should I try to reduce any scent from the previous dog by excessively watering outside and scrubbing down inside?  Or am  I anticipating non-existent problems?  Related but not dupes   How do I help my dog adjust after moving? Dog is crying and barking every morning since we moved in a new house  "
1579,I feed my turtles maggots..is that ok?,I have redeared sliders a male and a female I found some maggots (kind of embarrassing) but in my kitchen trash I save scraps for my bosses pigs but I didn't go to work for 2 days so kind of forgot it some food fell out on a bucket lid and last night my bfriend noticed them lol he wouldn't touch them and didn't tell me till this morning... When I looked at the lid it was completely covered in maggots. So with out thinking I tossed them in my turtle tank in the water my turtle ate them like a Pac-Man game did I mess up? Are my turtle going to be ok? 
1580,Is sugar/sweet food safe for cat,"I heard that sweet foods like sugar and other sweet things are not safe for dogs.   Are sugary and sweet foods not good for cats too?   There was a wild baby cat whom I saw today, her mother just died today. I gave the kitten my milk which had some sugar in it. Is it safe to give her milk with sugar in the future?  Please notice, that I although have mentioned sugar in milk, but I mean all kinds of sweet foods.  EDIT: It was Dairy milk  Also what home based food is safe for cat if Dairy milk isn't? "
1581,Is my dog the aggressive one?,"we just adopted a three year old dog, she is very friendly towards people when they come at the house or approach her, and outdoors she isn't even interested in other people.  I've been practicing walking her and right now i think it is safe to say she looks at me as the pack leader, she very rarely pulls, just when she finds an interesting smell and a little tug on the leash brings her right back, so for the third day i think we made wonderful progress. She also pulls a bit when we stop at a grassy area for her to relieve herself i think this is normal and this is her reward for behaving during the walk, i let her smell around and pull me a little ( is this ok?).  The problem is with other dogs, at the pound we took her for a walk, and at the exit we passed a couple of dogs returning from a walk and she freaked out, people at the pound told us she was just jealous. She has gotten better we are at a point where most times other dogs bark at her and she just ignores them.  So yesterday i noticed a dog giving her a stare down i ignored him and just when we were at our closest point (5-10 m, i was not going any closer and was returning home at this point) she noticed him and started barking (not sure who started growling and barking first), i gave her a tug and/or a pat on the neck and she snapped out of it and started ignoring the other dog's barking.  Today another dog was loose while his owner was sitting they started barking at each other and i got her to stop immediately again, but then she started crying ( as in i want to socialize?), So i moved away a little bit and when she stopped crying and calmed down i decided to let her approach, she behaved very well, started smelling him (the other dog seemed a bit scared or protective), she didn't bark or growl and only when we were very close to the other dog's owner the other dog started showing his teeth, barking, and growling, mine did nothing, the other owner told me this was normal behaviour for his dog so i decided to go away.  At the pound my dog lived with another dog.  I always try to keep calm and just correct her behaviour and ignore the other dogs, but i feel she wants to socialize, but it seems other dog owners in my area are ""bad owners"", what can i do? And am.i doing stuff right? "
1582,Will my puppy learn to cock his leg to pee?,Our three month old boy puppy squats to pee.  Will he eventually learn how to cock his leg by himself?  Is this learned behavior?  Is it common for puppies to be like this?  
1583,My dog attacks my friends and other dogs,"My west highland white terrier is aggresive against my friends for example he bit my cousin's leg, tore his jeans and created a wound. Also when he meets another dog even larger than him he will try to attack. To stop him attacking my friends we keep him in the balcony while they are here, was this the right way to act? Also what can i do about him attacking other dogs? Oh and before i forget we have a larger male dog has been terrorizing him since he was a puppy. Could this be the problem "
1584,Gourami breathing at water's surface,"I've had a pair of Pearl Gouramis and another pair of Opaline Gouramis for a few months now and, unlike any of my other fish (Tetras, Rainbow, Loaches), spend time at the surface breathing the air instead of allowing the water to pass through their gills.   Is this an issue or is this expected behaviour in a Gourami? Perhaps this is a sign of poor water quality?   "
1585,Why do my cats eat food that is not part of their natural palate?,I have noticed that most of our cats enjoy trying to get into the groceries.  Particularly bread and are very curious about other foods that are not a part of their natural eating diet.  I do my best to keep my cats on a diet that is natural for them to eat (mostly just dry and wet food). Should I let them taste any human foods?  Other foods they will sniff and bite then play with and mostly I am speaking to the bread that is left on counters.  Meats like fish and chicken sitting on the counter is understandable why they would try to go after it.  My female cat in particular goes bonkers over chicken.   Why do cats try to eat food they are not supposed to like or eat?  Does it mean they are missing something from their diet or do cats just like to eat anything that looks like food?  
1586,Sometimes my kitten doesn't eat from his plate,"This happens around 20-25% of the time I feed my kitten.    The kitten asks me for food. I put the food in the plate &amp; keep it at his usual eating place. He will smell it and then walk away disdainfully.  However,if I take small bite size portions in my hand and feed him - he will eat it - I have to feed him around 3-4 bites by hand &amp; then he will move to the plate and start eating it. Alternately, if instead of feeding him by hand, if I take a piece and put it on the floor, he will eat it. Again if he eats around 3-4 pieces from the floor, he will move to the plate and start eating off the plate.    My kitten is around 8-9 months old, male, neutered.        What can be the reason for this? And what's the solution? "
1587,Why was a worm exam negative when actual worm was included in stool sample?,"3 days ago, my 2 1/2 month golden retriever started passing worm segments in her stool. It was one segment on the first and second days and two segments in the third day.  I'm pretty sure it is tapeworm, based on description and images/videos found online. (They look exactly like this.)  Called the vet's office, then took a stool sample. Made sure one of the flat-squirmish worms were in there. Later they called saying that the result was negative.  The sample was in a large Ziploc bag (I didn't have a small one at the time). I'm suspecting they analyzed the stool sample but weren't careful enough to look around inside the bag for the worm segment.   Why was a worm exam negative when actual worm was included in stool sample?  Should I call another vet's office for a second opinion, since the puppy continues to pass these? "
1588,How can I get an adult cat to get used to a scratcher?,"Tea is already an adult cat but never had a proper scratcher so all the furniture of the house is full of scratches.  We know that is purely our fault (an unfortunate mixture of lazyness and ignorance), but is it possible for Tea to take the habit now to use a proper scratcher?  Personally, I'm afraid that simply dropping it into the house will not encourage her to stop scratching on chairs and sofa, so are there any tips to make an adult cat change a habit? "
1589,How to free a catfish from a strangling rubber band?,"I noticed that one of my catfish has a 1.5 cm strangling rubber or other material band around his head which must have started cutting into the flesh from this morning until this evening:      I have no idea how this could have entered into the aquarium and what material it is. It could be metal, but I think it's unlikely.  What is the best proceedure to remove the band? How to accelerate the healing? "
1590,Irish Setter or Cocker Spaniel?,I'm currently learning about dog breeds and I would like to know which breed of dog the following is. Is it an Irish Setter or a red English Cocker Spaniel? Thanks.   
1591,Is hot water enough to clean a reptile's water bowl?,"I saw on a forum once that hot water is enough to clean a reptile water bowl and I'm a little skeptical of this. Is this enough to clean it or should I use diluted vinegar, disinfectant such as Wipe Out, or a bleach solution?  Presently I have been using hot water and rinse every day, then every week or two I will do a ""deep clean"" and use a diluted vinegar solution to clean it, then let it stand for a while. I was thinking i maybe should disinfect it every time with a diluted vinegar solution but I wanted to know if this is needed?  Also is Wipe Out in the water dish bad? I use it for disinfecting the cage so it shouldn't be THAAAAT bad for the snake to be around but it could be different for the water dish.  "
1592,How can I tell if my rabbit broke her toe?,"I really need immediate help.  I live in India and adopted a rabbit 2 years ago. One year ago she gave birth to 6 healthy babies.  Her diet includes biscuits, fruits like  apple, cucumber, guava, raisins, watermelon, mango, and chiku. We provide a a local green leafy vegetable which she  loves and is very nutritious. Other than that she eats carrot, potato, tomato, and the leaves of cauliflower in winter.  She stays in cage but most of the time we let her out.  Recently I have noticed one thing in her leg. Her left foot' s little toe doesnt seem okay as compared to her right foot. The left foot's little toe seems to hang loose. She does not have any strength in that toe.  What should i do? Should i be worried? "
1593,Neighbor has a new cat - implications on our rabbits?,"Our neighbor has recently gotten a new cat - it's still quite young. It's recently been going into our garden and sitting in the rabbit run and actively staring at them. At the moment at least, our rabbits don't seem at all concerned about the cat even when it's less than a foot away from them. This may be because they're both bigger than the cat or they're just extremely lazy.  Should I be worried about this behavior? Should anything be done about this or is it considered normal social interaction? "
1594,How do windows impact health considerations of sunlight for pets?,"I heard, the goodness in sunlight that helps people make vitamin D does not pass through windows.   Is this true and if so does it impact pets as well? If my pet only gets sunlight through windows, how does this impact the health considerations (good and bad) of sunlight?  "
1595,Bearded dragon scared of hands?,"I recently purchased two bearded dragons. One is a juvenile while the other is not much older than a baby. The baby bearded dragon is very accepting of holding and interaction and doesn't do much besides bask. The juvenile seems absolutely terrified of human interaction and even puts itself in danger (trying to jump from pretty high, I am 6'2"", to the ground). I am concerned the dragon might have been mistreated to be absolutely terrified as it is the first I have owned that is scared.  The two dragons are in the cage together and get along fairly well. There is no fighting or dominance issues.  Is there a way I can break his fear? Should I consult the sellers about possible mistreatment? "
1596,So I am looking into getting a young rabbit but i have 4 cats,So i want a young rabbit and i have 4 cats and one of them is 2 years old and is very hyper he loves to jump and play and attacks the other 3 cats. Should I get a 3 month old bunny with a cat like him? If I can find a spot that would not be outside and would be out of his reach would that work? 
1597,Is not allowing your cat to hunt ok?,"I have a cat who lives mainly indoors but we leave the window open during daylight for her to come and go as she pleases. She could be gone for an hour or two at a time.   We have a little bell on her collar to warn birds she's coming and prevent her from bringing anything home. Instead, now and again she brings us home feathers that have fallen off birds every .  I'm wondering, is it ok not to ever allow her to hunt? Is hunting good for a cats psyche and wellbeing? Judging by her personality, I know she would love to stalk and catch prey. Should we take the bell off every now and again to allow her to hunt freely?  UPDATE: I meant to update this a while ago but within a week of me posting this, my cat (which we have had for two years) brought home her first 'gift' to me of a birds head and it's wings. She must have been reading my posts! The other day she also brought home a live bird which we have since nursed back to health and released back to the wild. To those you mentioned the bell not stopping hunting completely you sure were right!  "
1598,How to upgrade fish to a much larger aquarium,"I currently have a 15gal tank fully cycled. The tank is stock on the heavy side of thing and I purchase a larger tank (75gal) for another project I will not be doing finally. So I will use the larger tank to transfer the livestock of the small one when I move in about 2 week. I read the question ""Is it safe to move fish and all equipment to a new tank?"", but since the tank difference is much bigger I can't simply do as he did. Up to this point all is good, but now the new tank won't be cycled. The filtration on the 15 is an aquaclear30 with a double sponge filter.  I would like to avoid moving the livestock twice in a small amount of time. If I move the old filtration with the livestock could I simply add every one in the 75 and wait before adding anything else? I know the tank will be under filtered but in theory this setup handled the same bioload in the 15 gal tank.  The livestock currently in the 15 gal tank is 9 neon tetra, 4 zebra danios, 2 endler male, and 15-30 red cherry shrimps (not sure exactly how much I have in there... small baby factory). "
1599,Tips for encouraging a cat to eat more?,"My ~10-year-old cat (male, neutered, indoor-only) has recently has a decline in appetite and corresponding weight loss.  We've been to the vet, had X-rays and blood tests (normal), had an ultrasound, and are waiting for a possible biopsy of lymph nodes in/near the GI tract (showed as enlarged on the ultrasound), but the first available appointment is a few weeks away.  In the meantime, I'm looking for ways to encourage him to eat more.  When I put wet food down he eats a few mouthfuls and then loses interest.  I've tried a variety of canned foods, both pate and chunks in gravy, and including a prescription food specialized for GI problems.  The cat is allergic to fish, so canned tuna isn't an option (unless I get desperate enough that ""food now"" trumps ""allergic reaction later"").  Dry food is available all time.  He'll eat a few treats if I feed them to him one at a time, but not if I put a bunch out at once.  Fresh water is available at all times (multiple locations, replaced a couple times a day).  I normally feed wet food in shallow bowls; my vet suggested a plate instead, which hasn't made a difference so far.  She also suggested serving canned food at room temperature, not straight out of the fridge, which I'm doing.  My vet prescribed a low dose of an antidepressant (yes, really!) because a side-effect is appetite stimulation.  That seemed to make a difference on the first day, but not much since (it's been a week since we started this).  He had to have three teeth pulled about seven weeks ago due to resorptive lesions in his mouth.  My vet has examined him since and found no further problems in his mouth -- and, in fact, he was eating normally for a while after that surgery.  The loss of appetite is much more recent.  How can I get him to eat more?  Are there particular foods that might work better?  (I'm flexible about what I feed him, aside from the fish thing, if it'll get more nutrients into him.)  Obviously we need to identify and solve the underlying medical problem.  That's not what this question is about, though input on that is welcome too. "
1600,Why would a cat lick (groom?) her toy?,"My cat loves to play with fake mice on strings.  Sometimes, when she catches one of them, instead of biting or ""killing"" (attacking with her back feet) it, she holds it in her front legs and starts licking it, in a manner that's similar to grooming.  I've noticed that she does this when she's calmer and has already played for a while, and usually does it to mice who have fake feathers attached - usually goes for the feathers too.  I'm wondering if anyone knows why she does that - just curious. Do cats lick their prey? Does she consider it a 'friend' and wants to groom it? What else can it be? "
1601,Tightly curled over tail and strange gait,"Back in December my cat came in and was acting strangely, his back legs were low to the ground and his tail was curled right over like a spring onto his back. He then started walking round in a circle backwards.. As it was late at night there was nothing I could do. In the morning he had a limp and it seemed like his back legs were giving way and his tail kept curling over.  When I took him to the vets they couldn't find any problems with his bones, they gave him Metacan which he took for a week but it didn't do anything. I then took him back again and they said it might be a trapped nerve and didn't give any medication. I took him back AGAIN and they said to leave it for 2/3 months but I'm not happy to leave him like it! What do you think it could be?   I also had Ted microchipped and discovered it wasn't working after he couldn't enter the cat flap.. The vet couldn't locate it anywhere in his body so they gave him another one. Any chance the one that is 'lost' could be causing the trouble?  "
1602,Should I prevent my dog from eating grass?,"My main question is: if my dog wants to eat grass, should I prevent him?  I have heard that dogs do this to throw up, and seen this reason alluded to here: Why do dogs eat grass?, but am not 100% sure if this is correct.  He usually does throw up if he eats a lot of grass.  Here are the thoughts that are going through my mind, and why I am not completely decided on which path to take:  Reasons for preventing eating grass   He could eat a poisonous plant, which brings up another question: Do dogs avoid eating poisonous plants? He might just think it is ""free extra food"" and not realize it will make him sick (this assumes he is not sick to start with, which I am not sure if this is what is going on) I don't want to have to clean up the vomit afterward   Reasons for allowing eating grass   It might be that he is already sick, and needs to throw up for some reason (e.g. he might feel better after throwing up, and could be eating it on purpose to throw up) Maybe there is some nutrient in the grass that he does not get from dog food.  "
1603,What does a kitten want when it looks at you and meows a lot?,"Could it mean any number of things when my new kitten looks at me and meows a few times, or is there anything specific?   I'm just curious to know what it wants.   It has got food and water and toys.   Does that mean that it's bored?  "
1604,Is crunchy food good for a kitten?,"I bought a little bag of some cat ""treats"" (which look like plain food) and filled my new kitten's (2.5 months) food dispenser with it.   It seems to eat the food ok, but leaves broken pieces of it all over the carpet.   Is hard/crunchy food good for a kitten? Would a kitten maybe prefer soft food?  "
1605,What percentage of pet identification chips (i.e. Avid) are reassigned by new owners?,"This comes from a discussion on the question What information should we leave for a cat sitter/cattery? The chip company has a record of who the ""pet owner"" contact is, this can be updated when the pet is transferred to a new owner.   My Question is what percentage of new owners transfer contact information when a chip was originally registered to a previous owner/organization?  I am particularly interested in the break out of shelter/rescue pets.    I know in our family all of our pets are rescued.  The shelters we adopt from have generally installed the chip and they are listed as the owner.  The shelter keeps a record of adopting the specific pet to us.  We have chosen not to update contact information for the chip.     If the pet is lost and we know it, we are actively searching in the local area, so there is little chance that contact through chip information would be required.  If we don't know the pet is lost or if we don't know what area the pet is in, there is little chance that our home contact information provides any benefit to whomever is reading the chip.    So worst case, our pet ends up back at the shelter we rescued them from.  Because we know this, our local rescues acts as an always available intermediary.   While I have a specific motivation for not updating, I doubt that motivation for updating or not is available.  But I am curious to learn what percentage of chips are updated on pet transfer.  Preferable with breakdown by original chip installer; rescue/shelter, breeder, personal vet, other.  "
1606,Prevent small dog from eating crippled cat's food,"I have a cat which was born with two bad back legs. Because of this, I'm not allowed to have the cat food high up without some kind of handicap system.  My mother has a small chiwawa about the same size as my cat. The chiwawa tends to eat my cat's food, resulting in her puking it up later. I must find an easy way to allow my cat to eat, without worrying about not being able to access it while preventing the chiwawa from getting to it.  Are there any obstacle courses a cat with 2 bad back legs could traverse but a small chiwawa couldn't? Or maybe something I could put by the food to make sure the dogs can't get to it?  Sadly, putting the food in another room is not an option "
1607,Is it normal for a cat to go out and go back home voluntarily?,"Some Background  I live in an apartment at the 12th story of a high-rise residential apartment building in a typical Chinese city. The building has elevators and stairwells. In every story of the building, there are tens of apartments along the long hallway. About 2 months ago, I encountered a cat when I was about to go out from home and waiting for the elevator. When the elevator arrived and door opened, this cat just popped out of the elevator. He followed me and just sit at my doorstep, seemingly wanting to go inside, so I let him. I then adopted this cat whom I think was abandoned by others (which is not uncommon) in the same residential area.  First Time Letting Go  As time goes by, he became increasingly eager to going out. Several days ago, I let him go. He knows where the stairwells are and where it leads to (i.e., ""the outside world""). (The experience was gained by his former ""failed"" attempts to ""escape"".) So he went by himself, like the same voluntary way he came to me at the beginning.  Another day I saw him outside and ""miao""-ed at him. Then he just came back with me. (He went in and out elevator swiftly with me, and sit at my doorstep waiting for me to open the door.)  The Second Time Letting Go  He came back, ate, drank, and sleep.  After less than 48 hours, he seems to want to go out again. As before, I let him go.  The Unexpected and The Question  Yesterday afternoon, less than 2 days after his second leaving, my girlfriend opened the door as we were about to go out. The cat was just lying there waiting for us to open the door so that he could go in.  We are really shocked at this. Therefore I wish to know:     Is it normal for a cat to manage to go back ""home"" in a situation where s/he has to climb an exact number of stories to get the correct floor and find the correct door among tens of other doors?      How does he know which story to go for and which door to stop at? Is it by scent?   Any information is appreciated. Thanks in advance. "
1608,Can a young dog who's been previously pregnant confuse a toy as an offspring?,"We recently rescued a chiwawa who's, the vet says, about 1.5 years old and has clearly been pregnant before. When we first got her she would act worried and cry often; pretty normal for a dog in her situation. That faded as we trained her not to and she began to get comfortable.  After a while we noticed her playing with rolled up socks and a few of our other dog's (Boston Terrier) furry toys. So we bought all the dogs their own toys. Immediately, our other dogs began the ceremonious destruction of their's; while Bean, the chiwawa, looked as if she was living a horror movie.  Since, she has become burdened by the toy; she seems to worry about it constantly. She acts strangely around it seeming to hurdle over it and lay on it oddly. She's also started making her kennel bed with her mouth crazily at night when they go to bed. Earlier tonight we took it away on the DL. She's looking around for it and crying too. Is it possible she could be confusing this store bought toy as an offspring?  I've been around bread dogs and have seen where a mother will try to continue to care for a dead pup; is it possible she's remembering her motherhood? "
1609,"Sibling dogs accidental mating, Assistance regarding available options","Around an hour ago I came down stairs to find my Male and Female(Siblin's) Lhasa Apso (aged around 7 months old) ""locked"" / ""Tied"" together, My female is currently in heat and although we are ensuring they are supervised as much as possible on this occasion they were not being watched.  Myself and my partner ensured they remained calm as we allowed them to become unlocked.  We are now in a situation which I am unfamiliar with and I was hoping for some feedback/advice on the following:  1) I have read that pregnancy in young dogs carries increased complications and raises the risk of fatality considerably, this obviously is something we want to prevent, I presume our decision to not continue the pregnancy is the only option in preventing these risks?  2) I am unsure how long they were locked, although we suspect only 3-4 mins before we found them and then an additional 10 mins while we were holding them waiting for him to unlock, are the chances of pregnancy decreased by this lower duration?  3) I have looked into an injection branded(in the UK) MisMate (Alizin) does anyone have any experience with this? I heard its success rate is close to 100% if administered early(22 days)  4) I have also read that it is possible to get Her spayed during pregnancy causing it to be ended, However I heard it also carries increased risk? I Presume she can't be spayed while still in season, won't she be close to due date by the time she is able to be spayed?  Does anyone else have any other advice? We consider ourself good dog owners, The male dog is in fact booked in to be neutered on Monday! We wish to protect both the dogs from as much risk to health as possible.  Thanks in advanced. "
1610,Handling snakes and salmonella,"I'm not a snake owner (though I'm considering becoming one), however I've handled snakes belonging to friends.  I've been told you should always wash your hands after handling snakes because of a salmonella risk. However, I've also seen or heard about owners letting snakes go through their clothes (sleeves, for example), on furniture, including their own beds.  Is letting your snake slither about the place ever a problem in terms of salmonella? Or are hands simply the main/biggest problem because of eg. food handling? "
1611,Clavamox possible overdose,"My 15 year old female cat is being treated for suspected UTI.  62.5 mg tablet twice daily (every 12 hours).  Despite sitting with her for 1/2 hour to make sure she didn't expel it, and I was sure she had swallowed it, I found a dry perfectly formed tablet stuck at the back of her cat blanket.  If this was tonight's, I am alarmed because today I found one entangled in her white fur on her leg.    I was afraid to use that because instructions warn not to remove from foil until ready to use.       If this is not tonight's and I give it to her, would an excess dose be dangerous? What if it is older than tonight? Is the fact it's been opened for a time dangerous?   Should I just continue for the rest of the prescription &amp; pray the 2 missed tablets won't be too serious?  "

1613,Can goldfish have opinions?,"I have two goldfish for 2 years named Archimedes and Nelson. They lived in an aquarium with big white gravel. I changed their soil with dark blue pebbles as a result of advice given by my breeder. A few minutes after having handed Archimedes and Nelson their aquarium with their new soils, they slowly approached the ground and they began by ""rubbing"" with their new gravel (they swam for 2 seconds horizontally by scraping the gravel) . A few hours later and the following days, I did not observe this new behavior.  Are goldfish directly aware of their environment? Can they prefer certain things to others (prefer blue gravel than white gravel) and express their preferences explicitly through specific behaviors?  More broadly: goldfish (or other species) may have preferred fish (like best friends), prefer plants or soils more than others for their color, shape or texture. "

1615,"Should I consider switching an older (around 10 years) cat and maybe soon-to-be-7-years cats to ""senior"" food, what are the benefits?","I have 3 cats -   one around 10-11 years old (was a stray so I don't know exactly but not far from this) two littermates 6, nearly 7 years old.   All female and spayed. No particular breed, just ""domestic short hair"".  I am wondering if/when I should switch the older cat to the ""senior"" cat food? What are the actual benefits of that food if any?  Possible relevant information:   I feed a variety of wet and dry food. Usually dry food overnight/in the morning (when I go to work) and a pouch of wet food in the evening stable weight over the last couple of years or so (older cat in particular did get a bit fat a few years ago due to being greedy but I got that under control!) no relevant health issues (diabetes etc) for oldest cat only a bad tooth and a fall from height a few years ago. Yearly visit to vets for vaccinations etc and all looks good, and I haven't seen anything that I found concerning. I occasionally give them tinned tuna, sardines etc but not as their regular meals. they currently all eat together (side by side) and seem to be part of one social group   The ""senior"" cat food is usually advertised as being for age 7-8+ (and I'm conscious that my 6-year-old pair aren't too far off of being 7...)  I would like to know in what way ""senior"" branded cat food is different, and whether/when I should switch to it.  I'm in the UK and the main brands I buy are Felix (Purina) ""as good as it looks"" ""concoctions"" etc and a variety of dry food. "
1616,Are we feeding our bunny enough?,"About a month ago, our bunny had to go to the vet for what turned out to be a respiratory problem (probably a cold; Metacam did the trick, but that's by the bye). While at the vet, she mentioned that he was a good weight, but his teeth were too sharp and we ought to reduce his nuggets to 1-2 teaspoons per day. At the time, he was getting quite a lot of hay and the occasional fresh vegetable -- mostly parsley, spinach and coriander (cilantro), and the occasional carrot head -- but that was a considerable reduction to his dry food (which he loves).  Anyway, we reduced his nugget intake -- which didn't go down well, initially -- and he's slowly gotten used to it. (It was weeks before he was flopping again!) Consequently, his hay intake has increased and we give him slightly more fresh vegetables to compensate; plus he's become a bit crazy when it's nugget time!  He's not a fan of hay, so even though his consumption has increased, it's clear that it isn't as much as what the nuggets provided, as he's lost a lot of weight. For example, when you stroke him, his skeleton is now really obvious and he seems more sleepy than usual. He's happy, but we're concerned that he's not getting enough food.  Is this normal? If so, then I guess we'll just try to be less ""protective""; if not, presuming it's not a more serious issue, what additional food can we supply that's good for him (both his digestion and teeth) that he will actually eat?  (Mini lop; male, neutered; ~16mo. I don't remember his ""good weight"", but it was slightly over 1kg and he's smaller-than-average, even for a mini lop.) "
1617,"If the water quality is already perfect, do I need to wait any longer?",I just set up a small 23 liter aquarium for red fire shrimps. There is no shrimps in there.   I filled up the tank with water from a rain collector and mixed it with some mineralised water. This has been three days ago.  The guy in the shop told me to wait at least two weeks before I can put any shrimps in there. He also sold me a probing set to evaluate the water quality. Just three days in now and the water quality is now perfect according to the test.   Is there any reason to wait longer to buy shrimps? Is there anything happening in the next 10 days from a chemical process?  
1618,How do I maintain a population of daphnia inside a filtered tank,"I have an aquarium with a HOB filter. I tried to introduce a large population of daphnia to the tank, but by the next day, they had all been either eaten or filtered out. Is there any way to maintain a stable population of daphnia in a filtered tank?  If it helps, I have a 55 gallon tank with a few plants, some corys, a betta, a school of neon tetras, pom-pom crabs, and ghost shrimp.  I’m also a very inexperienced aquarium owner. This is my first tank.  This question is slightly different than:  How do you breed daphnia to feed to aquarium fish?  I am specifically interested in how to sustain a population of daphnia in a community aquarium, rather than in a separate enclosure. Maybe it is not feasible/possible? "
1619,Introducing a blind cat and a playful kitten,"I am currently fostering Alex, a two year old cat who was left completely blind after a car accident about two months ago. He has only recently left the vet clinic but is already quite well adjusted and fairly confident around the house where he's allowed to roam.  In the meantime, I am caring for a kitten that was (mostly) abandoned by its feral mother (she sometimes visits to eat) outside my building. The kitten must be two months old or possibly older (can't know). The kitten is only allowed in the house when I can supervise, otherwise he is either outside or in another room. He does not spend nights inside.  I've been trying to get them to socialise but I'm not sure that I'm making the right progress. I've taken it very slowly, starting out with a few minutes of them being around each other at a time, and building up gradually over the last couple of weeks. Since the kitten is outside my building, I can't keep him indoors and do the whole ""play through the door"" thing regularly - though we've done that, it ended with hissing. The best I've achieved so far is to get them to take turns playing with the same toy (mouse and bell on a string) and that was going great until the older cat performed a small but angry attack against the kitten. The kitten hit back. Some more hissing ensued, then they both retreated.  Can I have advice from anyone who's had to deal with a similar situation? Or any thoughts on whether this latest one was a positive encounter? I don't want to give up but I'm becoming impatient. "
1620,What boundaries are necessary for outdoor rabbits?,"I handle two rabbits in the backyard. At night they have a 3 square meter enclosure, at day the whole garden (I assume 100 square meter, but I am very bad in dimensions).  What requirements at walls/grids (and likewise) are necessary to prevent my rabbits from being prey of predators? (Especially at night)  What requirements at walls/grids (and likewise) are necessary to hold them into the garden? "
1621,"Betta died of fungal infection, when can I add a new betta?","My little betta passed away after a long struggle of being sick, getting better, being sick. He finally developed a fungal infection that I couldn't kick and he passed away. In the immediate moments of despair that followed, I emptied the tank, vowing to never own fish again because that little dude stressed me out, but now I want another one because fish are just wonderful little pets.   I'm not 100% what type of fungal infection he died of, he had cottony growths appear suddenly on his final day alive, but I'm wondering how long I should cycle the tank before reintroducing another fish. Here are my questions, in no particular order:    How much I should scrub things that were in the tank? Should I replace the black sand substrate, or should I leave some of the natural bacteria from the tank?  I have 2 moss balls, 1 zebra plant, and 1 madagascar lace plant - would they have a possibility of retaining fungus? How do you clean live plants?  I already threw the existing filters away, and my filter motor has some algae growth in the tubing that I can't clean out - should that concern me, or is some algae okay? Should I upgrade to a 10 gallon? This last tank had ridiculous algae growth that I couldn't control, something I did not experience with the first betta I owned. I tried a snail, but my betta killed it, so I'm hesitant to try that again. I think a 10 gallon could help this?   "
1622,"What is the cause, prevention, and remedy for an egg-bound bird?","This question was inspired by a comment to my answer to ""Cockatiel going into tight spaces"". The Wikipedia article on egg binding explains that it is a medical condition where a bird is unable to pass an egg lodged inside them.  The Wikipedia article is primarily about reptiles.  I am concerned about birds.  Are there specific causes of egg binding in birds and if so, what are they?    What can I do to decrease the probability of egg binding occurring?   How can I tell if my bird is egg-bound, and if she is, how can I address it? "
1623,Why is my dog always angry with me when I return from my office?,"My dog always seems angry with me when I return from my office.  This behavior is regular and he bites almost all of my family members, but still we want our dog to be with us. Any idea why is he behaving like this?  Any solution? "
1624,What distinct sounds do guinea pigs make? and what onomatopoeias are commonly used to describe them?,"I've been reluctant to ask this question as there many lists like this all over the net.  However, another question I had about cavies made that there isn't a good list of all synonyms and what information is availalbe isn't presented as clearly as one would hope.  Therefore, I'm hoping this community can compile a comprehensive list of the onomatopoeias used.  Most guinea pig noises are described by several different onomatopoeias, what triggers have they been associated with? "
1625,How do I choose a good supplier for buying insects online?,"I live in an urban area and I don't have a car so it's not practical to go to the pet shop every week to pick up new live insects when I don't need anything else from there. There are plenty of suppliers online for live insects - the pet shop itself has its own website, as well as assorted vendors on Amazon and other places. When choosing where to buy them from, what factors should I consider? Or should I just try a few sellers out and judge the quality of the insects that they send?  "
1626,What are the arguments against neutering a guinea pig?,"My cavy is interacting poorly with my rabbits and it seems to primarily be based around hormones.  The shelter that I rescued my guinea pig doesn't fix their guinea pigs because they claim they are ""too small"".  While this makes sense for me with respect to spaying, it seems to me that because neutering is so much less invasive the procedure should be rather trivial.  Am I wrong?  are there other reasons, aside from removing it's ability to breed that I would not want to neuter my cavy? "
1627,Why does my cat's nose get wet when purring?,"I noticed that my cat's nose gets wet from time to time.  I called the vet and he told me that I should observe the cat's activities: whether it starts being miserable, whether it eats less, etc.  None of them happens.  Every night when my girlfriend and I go to bed, my cat lies between us for a while, always purring.  And her nose always gets wet.  So, I realized that my cat's nose basically just gets wet when she purrs.  All the rest of the day, it seems to be dry.  None of her activities have changed; the only change I can think of is that recently she has started sleeping longer hours, but that could be caused by her age as she's not as young as she was (2 years and a half now).  Why does her nose get wet when purring? Should this be something to worry about?   "
1628,"Is it safe to paint the toenails of a reptile, or does it pose a hazard to the reptile?","I have no intention of doing this myself, but I saw some photos on Facebook of someone's bearded lizard with painted toenails and I was curious. Apart from the look of the thing (I'm not in favour, personally, but it's clearly opinion based!) I was wondering if this was safe or not. Could it damage your lizard?   Personally I see at least two possible hazard areas:     the nail varnish itself being toxic and either being absorbed through the nails or swallowed the nail varnish flaking off and posing a choking hazard, particularly for a smaller reptile like a gecko   If toxicity is a problem, are children's nail varnishes less toxic? And if it is all right to use nail varnish on a reptile, how would it be safely removed? Leaving it to flake off could be a problem if the lizard eats it, but I would think any commercial nail varnish removers would be more of a problem than the nail varnish itself. "
1629,Are axolotls and plecos compatible?,"I found this question on an amphibians forum. The answers provided on there were contradictory and I was hoping we could do better here on Pets.SE.      I have had my first axolotl for four months now. She lives in a tank on her own at the moment, but I was hoping to get her a friend. I'd like to get a second axolotl and a pleco. Would these three animals be compatible to keep together? What environment variables should I take into account when considering introducing multiple animals in the same aquarium? Her tank is 18°C, 96 litre, 3 foot.   "
1630,My leopard gecko is digging. Does this mean she's gravid and trying to lay eggs?,Found this question on a leopard geckos group on Facebook.     My new gecko keeps digging in her earth. As soon as I flatten and evenly spread it out she pushes it all back to the same spot and sits on top of it. Could this be a sign of eggs? Or is it stress-related? The guy I brought her from said she's 6 months but she's very small for that age so I'd say 4 maybe 5 months at most.   The best answer they had on there was     since theres a few of us with same issue im guessing its pretty normal? if you cant see any eggs and the fact shes so young suggests just behaviour rather than preperation   so I'm hoping some experts on here can clear it up so I can link this page to the person who was concerned :) 
1631,Are there alternatives to Stagbar antler chews?,"Our dogs absolutely love these Stagbar dog chews. They are the only treat I can find which keeps our dogs interested and is durable enough to last more than a few hours (the large ones usually last a few weeks). One of our two dogs also has severe trouble digesting normal bones/rawhide treats but these don't seem to have any adverse effects at all.  However recently, our local pet store has stopped stocking them. I was wondering if there was maybe something wrong with them that they've stopped selling them? They also seem to be very low on stock on Amazon.  Are there any similar alternatives?  edit: Took Ashley's advice and e-mailed the supplier - they replied with the following:     Due to the popularity of the product we saw a huge spike in demand   Sept/Oct last year. As a result we ran the whole European stock out   before the new shed antler arrives in April.   As you know it’s a   natural product and we can’t just produce as much as we want.   We   hope to have Pets at home restocked in March and have sourced some   antler from the Southern hemisphere but it takes a long time to get   here and get all the correct government paperwork in place.   So   hopefully during March you should see a return to normal, but in the   meantime if you do require some we are keeping a small supply   Which is good news and alleviates any concerns I had about the product, but I'd still like to know if there are any similar alternatives, given the apparent supply shortage. "
1632,Is corporal punishment an effective training method for dogs?,"This answer got me thinking, is corporal punishment really an effective training method for dogs?  Without doubt there are people firmly on both sides of any position like this, so answers that we have always done it 'this way' are not what I am looking for.  Are there any reliable studies, showing the effectiveness of corporal punishment, versus other training methods in dogs?  Alternately any studies that show effectiveness of any particular line of training that be compared in your answer to corporal punishment as a method.  "
1633,How do I stop a crated dog from barking?,"We recently rescued our dog (6-12 months old), who was very undernourished and slept quite often. As we've done with other pets, we attempted to crate train him. At first, it didn't appear that he had any issue with the crate and would not bark or show any signs of distress.   This changed once we took him to the vet for the first time. He received some pills and vaccinations to prepare him for the being around other dogs. That night, he began barking quite loudly in his crate for 10-15 minutes before giving up and going to sleep.   Is it possible that the vet gave him some type of medicine that could have caused this change in behavior? Or, is this behavior symptomatic of his health quality increasing, and with that, additional energy to express his distaste for being crated?  No matter what the reason, are there any suggestions for dealing with this behavior? "
1634,Why doesn't my cat like being held?,"We adopted our full-grown cat when she was a couple of months old.  She has never shown any signs of having been ill-treated prior to our ownership of her.  The problem is that whenever I grab my cat and hold her close to my chest, she stays still for a while (10 seconds at most), and then fights to be put down. I didn't experience this with my previous cat. It's also very rare for her to sit on my lap or jump on my bed. It's like she's not very fond of physical contact.  Why could this be? Can I correct this? "
1635,How can I keep a guinea pig clean?,"We recently adopted a guinea pig and in contrast to our rabbits, he's a smelly slob.  We clean his cage every other day, yet he's still musty.  He has a litter pan which he uses, but still occasionally decides to pee on the cage floor and then sleep on it.  Is there something else I should doing to help him help himself?  Further, I'm allergic to his hay, but he seems to bath in it, which makes him difficult to hold.  Should I be giving him daily baths?  Are there other products I should be using? "
1636,How can I help my Staffie who seems to have an itch in his bum?,"My Staffie moves his bum around on the couch like he has an itch or something.   We have given him de-worming pills, but he still continues to try and scratch it - albeit very unsuccessfully.   Do you have any advice on what I can do?   EDIT: Thanks, I read through How can I stop my dogs from scooting / dragging their butts? and it was very helpful although I don't think I have the stomach to do it myself.   Thanks all, this site is very helpful! "
1637,How can I gauge a vet's experience with reptiles?,"It's come to my attention that not all vets are trained to treat reptiles.  Other than the obvious ""Do you have a vet trained in treating reptiles?"", what are some pertinent questions I can ask a veterinary practice to determine how well qualified they are to look after my pet if there is a problem?  I plan to contact several practices, ask some questions and compare their answers, so I'd like to have a few really good questions that will provoke enlightening answers. Unfortunately, I'm not sure where to start or what I want to know.  Either questions regarding reptile veterinary care in general, or, if appropriate, more specific ones regarding leopard gecko care, would be suitable. "
1638,Do male guinea pigs do their mating dance before mounting other male guinea pigs?,Do male guinea pigs perform their mating dance before attempting to mounting other male guinea pigs?  I recently adopted a guinea pig and find it strange that he's dancing for both my female rabbit as well as my male rabbit.  Is this just typical guinea pig behavior?  or might it just be because my rabbit is fixed? or just because he's a different species? 
1639,What are the advantages and disadvantages to using a safflower seed litter box with my rabbit?,"Some people are looking for ecologically-friendly rabbit litter box solutions.  One solution is a non-absorbent litter in a drain-through litter box. The Smart Cat Box caught my attention when researching; it is filled with whole safflower seed.  Granting the claims of the manufacturer and assuming the system works well, what advantages and disadvantages should I consider when using a safflower seed litter box with a pet rabbit?  My main area of concern is that safflower seed is a feed product for rabbits. According to feedipedia, processed seed has been used with good results in production rabbit feeds. According to Wikipedia, the whole seed is a good bird seed because squirrels don't like it.  The whole seed is an ingredient in at least one pet rabbit feed, but it is not an ingredient (processed or whole) in either of my two, favorite quality, pet rabbit feeds 1 2.  So, could presenting a litter box full of whole safflower seed, be like presenting a bath tub full of sugared cereal to your child, or might they ignore it completely, or should I expect something in-between?  In particular, I'm looking for answers from experience on rabbit consumption of whole safflower seed (the type used by the litter box), and/or research on the long-term (8 - 12 years) digestion of large quantities of whole safflower seed by rabbits (alternatively demonstrating that a rabbit cannot digest a whole seed). "
1640,Why is my cat so interested in me making the bed?,"I've noticed over many years of cat ownership, a lot of my cats have a very excited interest in bedmaking. My current cat will come from any corner of the apartment when he hears me start to shake out the sheets and blankets, and scrambles under each blanket as I put them on my bed. This happens when I make beds at my mom's, too, where you can have up to four cats scrambling to get under the covers.   What is it about the putting blankets on my bed that is so very exciting to my cat? Is it just a random amusement for them, or does it have some deeper meaning? "
1641,Why does my dog make a fuss when my wife comes home?,"George, my 9 year old German Shepherd Dog/Border Collie mix, will make a huge fuss when my wife comes home. If he even thinks he hears her car coming, he will start barking, whining, and making lots of other noises until she comes in.   But if she is home and I come in, he'll trot over to me, sniff and lick my hand, and then be on his merry way.   Why does he makes such a fuss when she comes home?  Is this something I should be concerned with and correct?  If so how should I go about correcting the issue?  [more info, as requested]   If nobody is home when I get home, George will come to the door when I get home. I'll pet him, talk to him, and then take him out. If my wife is home, he'll be a bit more happy and excited, but he doesn't bark and make a fuss. If I'm home when she comes home, George will start barking and whining and pacing the kitchen until she comes in. He'll start as soon as he hears a car that sounds like hers. He'll continue barking for a bit while she comes in and settles down. Apparently if I'm not home, he doesn't do this as much when she comes home. If he sees someone he knows (he spends a lot of time in the kitchen because the windows go almost to the floor), who he likes, he'll become excited and do the excited/happy routine that he does when my wife comes home. If he sees someone he doesn't know or doesn't like, he'll bark and raise his hackles.  If we both come in at the same time, he'll come to the door, but he won't do the whole barking routine.  "
1642,What should we look for in a kitty companion for our rabbit?,"We have a neutered male dwarf rabbit who's about 18 months old. He's been an only pet for almost his whole life. He has a big cage to hop around in, and for the most part we leave its door open, giving him freedom to hop around his room and eat the cardboard boxes we leave in there for him. He's allowed to venture out into the living room or bedroom as long as one of us is there to keep half an eye on him.   We're thinking about adding a cat to our household (bringing the tally up to two humans, one bun, and one kitty). We want to make sure any cat we adopt will coexist with our rabbit, or maybe even be friends. The rabbit is pretty chill with new people as long as they aren't too aggressive with him, so we're hoping the same would be true with a cat.  It will be hard to find a cat with experience with bunnies, so what else should we look for? Should we get a young cat or kitten, hoping we can train it not to antagonize the bunny? A kitten would be about the size of the bun (for the first few weeks), so that might help him not fear the cat. Or should we go for an older cat that's too lazy to care? The bunny wouldn't feel threatened by the cat's attention if it were totally apathetic toward him.   How should we go about finding a feline companion for the bunny? "
1643,Why are there two ring stewards at the Westminster Kennel Club show?,"I've been watching some of the breed judging at the 2014 Westminster Kennel Club conformation show online and I noticed that there are two stewards in the ring. Any of the other dog shows that I've been to have had a single ring steward (I've shown at AKC, CKC and IABCA shows, and attended but not shown at UKC shows). Looking at the judging program for the show, there are indeed two stewards listed for almost every ring.  So, why does the Westminster KC show use two stewards for most rings? And in the few cases that they only have one, why are those rings different? "
1644,"How do I identify my alpha dog, or do I even have one?","I have owned three dogs, L, R, and C.  Here is their development in chronological order.  L is our first, male, neutered dog; born in 2000, we've had him since 2002 and he is still alive as of this posting.  He shivers a lot, and was nervous coming out of his crate for weeks after we first got him. He loved to live under the bed. Eventually, he lives on top of the bed and buries himself, but he also makes his way down, eats, goes outside, and sometimes relaxes.  He is very attached to my wife, going so far as to want to be in the shower with her; we used to have to lock the bathroom door to prevent wet dog every morning, until we got a shower with a sliding door.  He seems to have wised up about these things and simply lays down on the rug and waits.  L does not play with toys unless no one is looking.  L would not eat unless no one was looking.  L acts very submissive to my wife, flipping over for her and somewhat friendly (but also very vocal with barks) when she is home, but is a different, quiet dog when she is not around.  R is our second, male, neutered dog; born in 2001, we got him in 2003 or 2004 as a companion to L to help get L out of his shell.  He passed away 3 years ago.  R was a foodie and would eat until he burst if we let him (he had Cushing's Disease).  R could be very aggressive in play, and loved to tug on rope and chase and catch frisbees.  R would try to steal L's food (and our food).  L would growl and chase R away from his food.  Sometimes R didn't care what L thought, but other times he deferred to L.  To get L to eat, instead of waiting for night time, we would bring R into the room, then L would gobble his food down.  L and R played together a lot and relaxed against each other at times.  It was rare, but occasionally L and R would fight, mostly over treats (which R would steal from L and hoard; we chalked that up to his hunger disease), and they each had nips in their ears from the other having bitten down.  R was a larger sized dog than L.  R was extremely attached to me and would follow my every command; he acted depressed when I was not around, but would still participate in play.  He came when I called for him and tried to be with me whenever he could.  C is our third, female, spayed dog and is also alive at this time. We suspect she was born in 2008, and we got her in 2012 as a companion to L after R passed.  She grooms L on the face constantly, and L licks her mouth at times and sniffs her.  There has been a rare mounting attempts from L.  They lay down next to each other and sleep together in a basket, not unlike how L and R would.  She is the same size as R was.  Now that L is older, he eats his food without prompting; something he learned during the his time with R.  L will now try to steal C's food.  If C sees L stealing her food, she rushes over, shoves L out of the way with a growl, and eats her food.  She occasionally takes from L's bowl, but only when he isn't around.  Like R, C is attached to me and waits at the door for me to come home; she dances like crazy when I arrive.  She seems mopey when I am not home, in the same fashion that L is mopey when my wife is not home.  She comes when I call for her and tries to be with me whenever she can.  Is (was) there an alpha dog here, and what could be used to identify the alpha?  Is it L or C?  Was R an alpha?  Perhaps myself or my wife? "
1645,What do I need to consider when buying litter for a rabbit?,"We know that rabbits are easy to litter box train. At the pet store there are some litters in the cat area, and there are different litters in the rabbit (small mammal) area.  Can I use a cat litter?  If not what should I consider when choosing a rabbit litter?   "
1646,"When walking my dog at night, how can I improve his visibility to others?",I have a young puppy and I'm now walking him with a simple collar at night.  I want to improve his visibility to others.  I've recently added a flashing light (see picture).  What other tools/utilities can I use to make him more visible?  How about a harness?   
1647,How can I scent-train my dog?,"My dog is a 4-month old Brittany.  What kind of games can I imagine to help conduct some scent-training to exercise his nose?  I thought about hiding objects with some treats inside, or setting up many small boxes, only one would have something inside.  Any better ideas? "
1648,How do you tell a wild rabbit from a release domestic rabbit in southwestern Europe?,"We know from What species of wild rabbit is the domestic house rabbit descended from? that domesic rabbits are decendents of the European rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus) they are native to southwestern Europe (including Spain, Portugal and Western France).    In the US wild rabbits are Cottontail rabbit (Oryctolagus Sylvilagus) they have visible difference sufficient so that it is relatively easy to tell loose wild rabbit from a released pet rabbit.   I don't have any experience with native spanish rabbits.  How can I tell if a loose rabbit in Spain is wild or domestic? I suspect any that have domestic coloring are the result of domestic breeding programs but I don't know.  See related post Pustules in ears and eyes of an abandoned rabbit (appearance and dissapearance) for pictures of rabbit found loose in Spain that I suspect is a released domestic rabbit.  "
1649,One cat doesn't understand the other is just play-fighting,"My girlfriend and I have two three-year-old cats: Napoleon (male) and Josefine (female). They are siblings from the same litter. I have been studying abroad for the last 9 months, so currently my girlfriend's the one taking care of them.  The two cats get along just fine for the vast majority of the day. They eat together, the female frequently bathes the male (though baths usually become a small fight for some reason, and she really doesn't like it when he tries to bathe her), and my girlfriend sends me pictures (and videos) of the cats sleeping cuddling together in the most adorable ways at least once a week.  However, whenever the two play together, Napoleon seems to have a hard time understanding the boundaries of acceptable behavior and takes things a bit too far.  It doesn't help that Napoleon is significantly larger (1&nbsp;kg = 2&nbsp;lb heavier even though they're the same age) than Josefine, and that she sometimes honestly seems to ask for it.  As a representative example, please watch this 45-second video. Josefine waits to ambush Napoleon as he leaves the bathroom (where we keep their sandbox) and gives him a light tap on the head (I interpret this as a play-ambush). He gets seemingly startled and then the situation momentarily escalates (but not severely), followed by Josefine becoming slightly submissive (hunching down) and letting out long, trembling meows as both seemingly vie for an opportunity to strike. Napoleon then lets out some meows of his own and Josefine becomes very submissive, lying down.  The video ends there, and my girlfriend says that's when she interrupted the fight by calling their attention. In similar situations when she hasn't stopped them (she usually lets them solve things out for themselves), Napoleon will go for a bite or something of the sort, Josefine will bat him away and run away, at which point Napoleon will sometimes give chase. If he does, the fight continues with more jabs and some biting. Nails always remain sheathed and the bites don't seem to be meant to injure (no one's ever come out bleeding, shall we say).  Sometimes we just see the chase and don't see the instigating incident (or whether there was one), but Josefine seems to be the usual initial instigator. Other times the cats play ""tag"", running around the house with no issue.  Once the fights are over, the cats don't seem to avoid each other or anything indicating lasting animosity. That being said, one time (and only one time that we're aware of) Napoleon did end up with a tuft of Josefine's hair in his mouth.  Since neither cat seems very affected by the fights, my girlfriend usually doesn't interrupt them. That being said, we'd rather stop this behavior or at least understand it better.  Is this actually just normal play-fighting (and the time Napoleon got a mouthful of hair was then just a one-off accident/escalation) to be shrugged off? Is our interpretation of Josefine's behavior incorrect, and she isn't play-fighting at all? Or, if we are correct in our diagnosis that Napoleon simply doesn't know how to play-fight, is there some way to teach him to turn it down a notch?  For some further context into our cats' recent history and how their behaviors changed (quite significantly) after I left to study, please see this other question I asked 7 months ago. This type of fighting also only started after I left, so that context might be relevant. (Also note that the issue raised in that question has passed) "
1650,Completely Self Sustaining Aquatic Environment in a Sealed Jar,I recently got the idea into my head to create an entirely self sustaining aquatic environment in a (large) sealed jar. I'd like to include:    A layer of soil and gravel at the bottom A large number of plants for natural chemical cycling Algae Brine Shrimp Copepods Maybe a few larger shrimp (enough to create a self sustaining colony)   What ratios of Algae to Brine Shrimp to Copepods to Shrimp biomass should I establish in the environment? What minerals/chemicals should I ensure are present before I seal the jar shut? What plants should I use? Am I crazy for thinking this could actually work? 
1651,Leaving an American Eskimo dog at home regularly,"I am thinking of getting an American Eskimo dog (most likely toy size). I live in an apartment (in Stuyvesant Town, New York City, New York, U.S.A.).   In the usual weekday, all 4 people in the family go to work or to school. The earliest leaves at 6:45 a.m. (or, will, next school year), and the latest leaves at 7:50 a.m. The earliest comes back around 3:00 to 3:40, with the latest coming back later than 7:30 p.m.   This means that the dog would most likely be alone for 7 hours a day, and would only be walked twice a day [at 6:30 am and 6:30 p.m.] for half an hour at a time (the hour a day part seems ok for this breed by what I've read). Is this ok for an American Eskimo? If not, why not, and if not, is there any easy way for me to make this better without letting an outside person become attached to the dog?  I read somewhere that if a dog (no matter what breed) is used to a schedule like this from puppyhood, then it will do fine. Is this true?  Edit: If I leave my dog in dog daycare or training for 8 hours, how attached will the dog become to the people there? "
1652,Leaving an American Eskimo dog at home with another person while on vacation,"I am thinking of purchasing an American Eskimo dog. My family and I travel a lot (especially during the summer), and I'm sure there will be times when we will not be able to take the dog with us. Is it ok to leave it (for 1-3 weeks) at the home of a person who comes about once a week for 3 hours at a time? This person currently lives alone 1.5 hours away (in Long Island), is quite good with dogs, and has no pets. Assume that he will walk the dog as often as we would.   If this happens not to be a viable option at the time because that person is also away, can the Eskie be left with a dogsitter (that it has never seen before)? Some of you will go ""duh, that's what dogsitters are made for!"" but I have heard that American Eskimos are very wary of strangers.   Also, does anyone know of any trustworthy (and fair-price) dogsitters around Stuyvesant Town (lower east side of NYC, New York, USA)?    See also: Leaving an American Eskimo dog at home regularly    The only reason I used ""it"" as opposed to ""he/she"" is to avoid confusion (some people, when seeing ""he/she"", will assume I am talking about a human.

1653,What's the safest earlier age a foal can be vaccinated against tetanus and strangles?,"If the foal misses out on the mother's colostrum, they may miss out on immunity from the mother. In this case the foal didn't get colostrum and her IGG tests were poor. She had two plasma infusions to help her immune system. The vet wanted her to have her vaccinations earlier.   What's the safest  earlier age a foal can be vaccinated against tetanus and strangles?  Can one be given more safely earlier than the other?  note: I will go with the vet's instructions, I find it an interesting question to understand the why "
1654,Dog Sitting: drop-off vs pick-up,"This may sound like an odd question but I will be dog sitting for a friend for 2 weeks. The dog is 8 months old, very active, and hates parting with his owners.   Would it be best for me to go meet the dog in his own home and then take him with me? Or would it be better for his owner to come to my house with the dog for a bit and then leave?  I’m just wondering what dog owners think would be easiest for the dog to handle. I see pros and cons to both. I don’t want the dog to think I stole him away, but I also don’t want him to think his owner came to my house and abandoned him or forgot him. Any thoughts on the psychological/behavioral side of things here? "
1655,Our dog accidentally ate pimobendan,"We have a dog who is on pimobendan, and our other dog who is about 13 pounds accidentally got .625 mg of it.   Will he be okay?? "
1656,Dog peeing inside,"We have a 12 year old chihuahua that keeps peeing in the house. It's mostly on the linoleum, but sometimes on the carpet. I have no idea why he keeps doing this. There is a doggy door, which he used to use, but not anymore.  A few things have changed since he used to use the doggy door. We had a second child (now 4 years old). We took in a stray dog, lab mix. The new dog definitely holds it to do her business outside. The new dog has her own bed inside, but spends most of the day outside. The chihuahua pretty much has his own couch to lay on. If we mop the whole floor, he will pee several times, in different places. I woke up to 4 pee spots this AM, after mopping yesterday. It's like he's trying to mark territory.  When the chihuahua pees inside, sometimes we put down paper towels to soak it up before cleaning, and sometimes he will pee again on the paper towels. If we can't get him to use the doggy door, what can we do to get him to at least pee in the same place? Possibly on the ""go here"" pads?  This is really pissing me off (pun intended), how can I mitigate this?  Please suggest appropriate tags. "
1657,Male cats attacking female after 1.5 years of relative calmness,"Background:  I have had a cat since he was a kitten about 8 years ago, about 4 years ago I adopted another male cat of similar age hoping they would play together and be friends when I started my job. They largely ignored each otter but do sleep near each other and seem to in general just exist in the same space. About 3 years ago I moved from a 2000 sq ft house into a 800 sq ft apartment and then 2 years ago I moved into a 800 sq ft condo. Through all of this my two cats seem to have been fine with me and each other. About a year and a half ago my girlfriend moved into my condo with her much smaller younger female (2 years). Things went OK, mostly the small female stays up on a network of shelves we built for the cats, but she can come down to eat, drink and use the litter.   We have been using Feliway since the small female moved in.   Change:  About a month ago things have gotten significantly worse, with my cat's attacking the small female when she tries to go to the litter on her own. We recently went on a trip and when we got there were a large number of fur piles from one of the males and the female and one of the shelves where the female hangs out had both urine and poop on it (it seems like she wasn't able go down to the litter).  Questions:  Does anyone have any ideas about what might have changed? Why it got worse all of a sudden? Does anyone have any ideas on trying to make it better?  "
1658,Dog destroying wallpaper at one exact place only,"So I've got a situation.  We wallpapered our corridor and our 8 month Labrador Retriever decided to scratch off one part of that wallpaper (it's next to the door to bathroom).  I've fixed it couple of times and she repeatedly does it over and over and does scratch off that exact part only, nothing else.  She's got a crate and is left there for up to 5 hours when we're working. However this time she scratched it off when I was showering and she was not in the crate.  Normally she gets a quick walk in the morning to do the business and an exhausting walk in the evening (sometimes twice a day depending our working schedule), at least 4 walks per day in total.  Also, she always tends to follow me and my wife at home, if we'll go to bathroom, she'll go to the door and lay there, if we're making food, she's going to lay next to us, etc. Doesn't beg for attention, but is a follower.  I cannot figure out the reason why she would do it. Is it (faked) separation anxiety? Attention seeking? Boredom? Something else? "
1659,Help: Wild Rabbit,I brought in a wild eastern cotton tail rabbit 2 days ago and I can't keep it as a pet. I was wondering if I keep it until it grows a little bigger that I can release it back into the wild where I found it? Or would it domesticate by then?  
1660,Is it easier on my dog to move in a single day or take 2 weeks to get used to the new place?,"I've recently found out that I'll likely be moving in about 4 weeks to a new home in the same neighborhood (8 city blocks from my current building), thanks to ever increasing rents in NYC.  I'd like to make the move as painless as possible for my 1 year old Keeshond. Luckily, we'll be in the same neighborhood, so we'll still go to the same parks and we'll be close enough to walk around the same general area (i.e. it won't be a completely new area that she's never been to).  Aside from moving I don't anticipate anything else changing (same dog walker, same vet, same schedule, etc).  My question is whether I should move fast or slow - I have the option to move in early to the new place and have an overlap of 2 weeks, so I'd be able to move all my things slowly and bring the dog over to the new place to hang out and hopefully get used to it. I've read that I should just send the dog to daycare, move everything into the new place in a single day and then never bring the dog back to the old apartment - in essence a ""clean"" break.  If there's a ""right"" option between the two, what is it? Are there other things I should be doing to prepare the dog for moving?  It doesn't seem like this question has been asked before, though I did find 2 questions about what to do after you've moved with a dog (here and here) which are unable to answer my question. "
1661,Did I damage my kitten by accidentally forcefully opening her eyes?,"I might have accidentally opened the right eye of a week old kitten. I was holding her head in order to place the feeding bottle in her mouth. She then squirmed (like she always does when trying to find the feeding bottle) and this stretched her face enough for her right eyelid to open. Her exact age should be 8-9 days, and the force applied to her face wasn't really different to how I've been holding her all the time when I feed her (since 1-2 days old); this makes me think that the eyelid was actually ready to open (because they should be sealed really tight when they're not ready yet, right?) and then it just happened when she rubbed against my hand.  What signs should I look for in order to know if the eye was ready for it or if I have caused damage? Also, will she be able to close the eyelid by herself (to sleep) or is there something I must do about it?  Edit: I just saw them while they're sleeping and she has both eyes closed just fine. I guess I don't have to worry about the part about being able to close it now. "
1662,Medication for cat with difficulty breathing / congestion,"I'm watching a friend's cat and she has trouble breathing, sounding like she's snoring/slurping constantly (""nasal stertor"").    Apparently this is ""normal"" for her.  She's always been like this, and she behaves normally otherwise, but it would be nice if there were some way to improve the symptoms.  She's had surgery for nasopharyngeal polyp(s?) and antibiotics to clear infections.  Her nose is constantly plugged with grayish mucus and she breathes through her mouth.    Expectorant like Bisolvon or Guaifenesin? "
1663,"Female turtle unexpectedly laid eggs, what do I do now?",I have recently rescued a female Indian flapshell turtle. I kept it in my tank for few days. I found 9 eggs in my tank today. Can I expect babies from the eggs? How do I need to care for the eggs? 
1664,How do I get ready for my first dog?,"A good friend of mine is getting very sick (kidney disease. :( ) and is having to give up his dogs, including a 1 year old Cheweenie mix named Titan that I'm adopting, initially out of guilt but he's just plain grown on me.  I am really, really attached to the dog and am getting ready to bring him home.  Currently, Titan is left at home most of the day with four other dogs (his mom and siblings), and when i bring him home, he'll be alone most of the day alone.  I know there's a nearby dog daycare that I could take him to a few times a week (I've seen a few questions about folks that are in similar situations that suggested this), and I can commit to the time to take him for walks, since i'm planning on doing more active stuff as it is.  I've lived with dogs, but I've never had one before. I read This question about getting ready for dogsitting and it answered a few questions, but what other things should I do to prepare my apartment to make sure Titan is comfortable?  What should the first week or so look like as I get Titan settled into his new home?  A few things about Titan:   As I mentioned, Titan is used to having his brothers and sisters around constantly.  I don't know what to do for the poor guy about this. He's a digger, and destroyed a couch already.  I just got a new one, so... yay. He's a small dog, so is there a good time or distance for a morning walk for him?  "
1665,Is the cat trying to communicate by leaving toys in significant places?,My boyfriends cat will often bring toys and leave them in places that seem to have meaning.  This morning he found 3 toys in the spot where he sits to put on his work shoes every morning.  What could this mean?  What is his cat trying to tell him? 
1666,Can I relocate an outdoor feral cat when I move?,"I am in a rental due to hurricane Mathew, and will be moving in Aug. I have a feral Mama and 2 kittens. I  trapped  mama, had her spayed and vaccinated, brought her back and released.   I trapped the kittens, which were approximately 10-12 weeks old. I also had them neutered/spayed and vaccinated but I'm keeping them in a bedroom. They are becoming more tame each day. I have them on a waiting list for a beautiful no kill shelter, Palmetto Animal League, in Okatie SC. I went to see it. I already have a housefull of dogs and cats.   My question is, should I take mama to my house, few blocks away, and release her? That way I could feed her. Will it be too much for her? Here at the rental, she calls me twice a day to feed her. She is a great hunter also. It will break my heart to leave her. She has never let me pet her. I'm sure she knows that I have her kids. Signed, just want to do the right thing!!!!!!! "
1667,Vegetarian Food for Cat(2 Months Old),"A stray kitten of about 2 months old came to my door steps two days back, it was looking sick as well as weak , I have adopted it. He seemed to be having an issue of indigestion when it arrived and I did feed him milk. I got him checked with one local vet and I got the medication for the indigestion. The vet told that the cat needs Non Veg food which happens to be strictly not allowed in my house.   Being this is a house rule, and I'd like to explore my options; what health risks are involved in feeding him a vegetarian diet? Does the reward outweigh the risk? And if I choose to feed a vegetarian diet, is there a specific mix that would be MOST healthy for this kitten, being 2 months old? "
1668,Unexplained limping,"My dog is a rescued Labrador/English mastiff cross, so she's big(but not fat) at 35 ish kg and approximately 8.  She has been limping at times which has come and gone. Currently it's quite bad.  She has undergone arthritis treatment which has not worked. Then we tried codeine with metacam and still no improvement.   We then had her go for full body x-ray and still nothing: no arthritis, broken bones, displesia, tumours or any lumps.... absolutely nothing!  This is now to be confirmed by a specialist but we think it will still be nothing.  Does anyone have any ideas? My Father in law believes it's a sprain?  Edit: it comes and goes: she was really bad (as she is at the moment) a couple of years ago. Then it literally just stopped. This year, in March, she started to have a slight limp, then it went away. She went for a long walk with her dog friends and returned really bad.  "
1669,Will cooking rocks and branches in the oven make them safe for aquarium fish?,"I want to add some rocks and tree branches to my aquarium for decoration. If I put them in the oven and cook them, will they be safe for the fish? What temperature and length of time is sufficient? "
1670,Is it too late to train my cat out of biting?,"My cat is now 8months, and I think I've been too permissive when he was younger, since I played a lot with him allowing him to give me small bites.  Now he bites a lot, even when I'm just petting him and he becomes tired, or when I'm on the sofa with the hand hanging.  Is there still hope? Should I try to fix this behaviour with a water spray? Or with food to show him when he is doing good?  Thanks in advance "
1671,What size of hutch would be right for two mini lops?,"Warning, I am completely new to owning rabbits! Have had guinea pigs/hamsters in the past but no rabbits.  I am interested in buying two mini lop rabbits and  have a large garden but a small budget. What would be the best sized hutch for them that is not too expensive? Would it be OK to just have a run with a little sheltered bit for them? Also have two dogs so living indoors isn't really an option, any ideas?   ALSO   If i were to get two rabbits that had already bonded, i.e from the same family, would i need to get them spayed/neutered or will they not fight as they get older? If they are spayed/neutered how would i look after them when they got home (for ex. would i split them up for a few days?)  ALSO  What medical needs do they have? found bits and bobs of their needs on the internet but nothing was particularly clear to me.  Many thanks,   Anon. "
1672,How long can a dog stay outside on a 95 F (35 C) day safely?,"How long could you keep a medium sized, brown, healthy 2 yr old dog outside in full sun without water on a 95 degree Fahrenheit (35 degrees Celsius) day without risking sunburn/heatstroke/etc?  Clarify (from comment posted by OP) A dog was kept in that situation for an hour and a half, got into a debate about whether that was too long and went looking for sources for backup but none give a time limit. Argument was ""well you take a dog to the beach, right?"" "
1673,Dog vomiting yellow/white foam since being fed vegan food,"UPDATE: Must have been something else. Vet gave an oral medicine and everything was back to normal in 2 days. I still feed him vegan food 6 days a week.    A few days ago, I decided to feed my dog vegetables (&amp; some fruits) more often than animal sources like meat, eggs, milk, etc. (He is a 4-year old golden retriever.)  This is what I fed him for a few days: [Whole rice, soybeans, red lentils, sweet potatoes, carrots, tomato, beans, cabbage, spinach, coriander] in the morning and [1/2 apple, banana, 1/4 pomegranate, 1/4 beetroot, oatmeal (with water)] in the evening.    The 1st day on which I fed him the diet went fine. I checked his stools in the evening as a precautionary measure and It seemed fine, I think I saw some undigested soybeans in there, otherwise it was fine, but he sh*t a ton.  I checked his stools in the morning on the second day, and I could still see more soybeans (which I fed the previous morning). I fed him the same diet on the 2nd day as well and checked his stools in the evening. Same story.  On the 3rd day, early in the morning, he vomited what looked like yellowish foam; not a lot, more like 3-4 tablespoons. And from the stools it was clear that he's unable to digest soybeans.  He vomited on the 4th day (early morning like before) as well. Bad stools and vomiting got me worried. So I had the soy and lentils ground and cooked instead of cooking whole. This following evening, his stools are fine and it's no longer a ton. Then he slept as usual and all of a sudden woke up only to vomit some white foam/liquid (could be oats, could be bad stuff happening inside, I don't know).  The same happened on the 5th day. Today he vomited (yellow again) while we were out for the morning walk.  What could be causing this? Could it be because of indigestion (soybeans)?  He's hopping and running around as usual, and I couldn't find indigestion causing yellow foamy vomiting. As of now I've removed soybeans and lentils from his food.    .  Update  Like I initially thought, my dog is doing great since removing soy and lentils from his diet. So, it's most probably due to indigestion caused by soybeans. I'll add back lentils soon; so this is what I plan to feed him now (5 days a week):   Morning: whole rice/ground quinoa, red lentils, sweet potatoes, carrots, green beans, cabbage, spinach, olive/sunflower oil, coriander/turmeric Evening: 1/2 apple, banana, 1/4 pomegranate, 1/4 beetroot, oatmeal (with water), honey     .  Answers to your questions     Before you ask: Feeding him veggies and fruits only isn't very healthy. Give him meat; dogs thrive on it!   I feed him meat, eggs and milk 2 days a week. The rest of the days he gets cooked veggies, and in small amounts, raw fruits, and some grains (whole rice, oats, quinoa)—to provide all the nutrients he needs to have a perfectly healthy body.  As for formulating my dog's diet, we all have our understanding. Just to state what I think——I don't believe that diet is rocket science; except that you should know what you are feeding is nutritious and not harmful in any manner. Then if you vary the diet enough, the dog would be healthy and fine. Meat, poultry, eggs, and milk aren't as nutritious as they once were, and can even be less nutritious or outright harmful in the long-term (due to steroids or bad diet given to source animals, among other reasons). There's no one right way. And I am not arguing. I am sure you all have your opinion.  I'll of course be monitoring my dog's health closely. :)     I'm also concerned about other elements of the diet, raw egg can lead to skin and coat issues as well as running a salmonella risk.   I should have been more clear earlier. None of the ingredients in my dog's diet, except fruits, are served uncooked. Hopefully explained well in the question now.     [...] Nevertheless, I'm not convinced that this diet is healthy.      [...] What's the source of this diet?   I've made a list of the most essential nutrients for dogs, and their sources. Then I made sure that all bases are covered in the diet I feed my dog. The 'diet' on the whole is healthy. If you have more questions, as to whether a dog can be fed mostly-vegan diet at all, you may want to google 'vegan food for dogs'. There IS some credible information.  READ: Homemade dog food: Essential nutrients &amp; their sources  Also, I have cross-checked the ingredients of some of the top pet-food brands.     Do you give the dog the core of the apple to eat? Apple pips contain cyanide, not dangerous in small doeses but if he's having them regularly...   No. The core is removed. I have done my research. :) "
1674,Dog won't eat or drink or come to me on his own? How do I regain his trust?,"Yesterday night I was foolish and kept trying to coax my dog to drink water because he hadn't drunk any water for hours even after his walk. I got frustrated and picked him up to put him in the room he stays in (he got excited at first because he thought I was going to put him on my bed but started whimpering on the way to his room). I didn't yell at him, hit him, or put him down violently on his bed, but it was probably the irritated manner in which I carried him there.. After I took him out this morning (7AM) he was whimpering when I petted him and then he walked away and sat a distance from me and continued to whimper. He also would not eat his food, so I had to hand feed him. Afterwards, I went back to bed and allowed him to sleep with me this time and he was fine but when I picked him up to put him on the floor when I woke again (the bed is high) he was shrieking and yelping although I was definitely not hurting him and I'm sure he has no injuries as he was perfectly fine before I acted so terribly. He has always been a timid dog ever since I've had him because he was abused at his previous home. He usually eats again at about 5PM but now he won't even eat from my hand, let alone his bowl. He puts it in his mouth and spits it back out and has not drunk any water so far today. I left the room where he usually stays but now he also has not moved from his bed whereas this morning he still followed me to my room even if he did not sit by me...  I apologize for rambling I just wanted to give some background. I have never EVER hit him, I have never hurt him (until now I guess) I love this dog more than anything in this world, more than myself.  Also, if I tell him to come to me he will come but whimpers when I pet him and then leaves to sit a distance from me again. I feel terrible even though I did not physically harm him. I just want him to eat and return to his former happy self, even his trot seems so slow and depressed now and I know I'm to blame. I know I should not have acted this way knowing how sensitive he is..   My main question is how do I make him eat and drink again? And how do I let him know that I'm sorry for acting how I did and that I would never hurt him? Please help me. "
1675,What antiseptic is safe to use on reptiles?,"If my geckos get cuts or scrapes, what is safe to use to clean the wounds?  TCP? Iodine? Antiseptic? Something else?  I have a reptile-safe disinfectant that I use to clean the tank with, but there's a world of difference between sterilising an environment and applying something to an open wound. I doubt very much that it would be suitable.  I have seen products like this advertised as wound cleaner for reptiles. That's the only such product that that website sells, so I don't know what my options are. I also don't know if I can use antiseptics or TCP intended for human use on my geckos, or if it will be toxic to them.  Please bear in mind that I'm from the UK, so if you use American (or elsewhere-ian) brand names, a translation of what they actually are would be great. "
1676,How much protein do dogs need in their diet?,"I was just curious, for the interest of mixing homemade dog food and getting the correct ratios of nutrients in the food. How much protein do dogs need in their diet in order to be healthy.  I found two sources for the amounts of protein needed in a human's diet:   According to the CDC, 10-35% of your daily calories should from from protein. The wikipedia page for Complete Protein shows a table from the World Health Organization that explains the recommended amounts of each amino acid for a grown human. What are the amounts for a dog?   What would be the guidelines for dogs? "
1677,Can I keep a monkey as a pet?,"It seems it's not common to see monkeys as pets. I'm not sure of the reason, despite they're supposed to be smarter than any other pets (e.g. dogs).  It is possible to have a monkey as a pet (in the US/UK/EU countries)? Or there are some difficulties with that? "
1678,How can I keep my pet from being full of static?,"I love cuddling with my cat. Lately we have had our nightly cuddle and pet, and I have noticed that he is very staticky, creating lots of bright static sparks every time I pet his fur.   Is there anything I can do to stop him being a static electricity machine? I know my apartment is somewhat dry because of the heaters I have going, would that be part of the problem?   How can I stop my cat from being so shocking when I pet him?  "
1679,Helping a lethargic pigeon in the winter,"It's winter here, pretty cold. There's a pigeon outside my apartment building that just sits near the building and doesn't do much. It can see. It can move, but does so rarely.  I gave him bread and now I'll give him sugar water (suger/water = 1/5). What else can I do to help it? I'll probably buy some bird seeds as well. Can I take him at home? I have cats, but can leave the pigeon in a separate room where the cat's can't catch him.  tl;dr what to give to/ do for a pigeon that just sits outside on the ground in the winter.  I consider him an important part of the community and my life - he's exactly like a pet to me. An outdoors pet, but still pet. "
1680,"Why do my cats play ""soccer"" with their dry food on the floor?","Only recently, my 1½ year old females cat have been playing ""soccer"" with a dry food morsel across the kitchen and then returns to the bowl to eat. Why do they play with their food? Are they bored of the particular type of dry food I'm giving them? Do they need me to play with them more? "
1681,A way to say 'hello' to a dog?,"I'm just curious. When I meet cats, I slow blink at them (a sign of trust that, as a side-effect, tells them I'm not threatening), and I noticed that I automatically do the same with dogs, which probably doesn't make any sense to them. So, is there a way to tell a dog I'm not threatening/am approachable/can be trusted? Wagging a tail is out of the question ^_^  EDIT: Seems like I worded the question wrong. It's not about actively approaching a dog. What I meant is, is there a way to let the dog know that it can approach me if it wants to? What I'm interested in is the casual show of intent, certainly not the action. "
1682,Do most dog owners want strangers to ask before petting?,I have experienced that people have different views on whether strangers should ask before petting an animal in lead.  What is the norm on this? Is there any unspoken rule among dog owners? 
1683,Is it possible for a deaf kitten to sense growling/hissing from another cat?,"I've recently adopted a deaf kitten (two days ago). She doesn't respond to any sounds, but she does respond to my senior non-deaf cat hissing and growling (I'm slowly introducing them).  Is it possible that our deaf kitten can sense the growl/hissing? They don't even need to be in eye-shot of each other. The senior cat hears the kitten's bell and growls, and the kitten can pick up the growls/hissing and responds with her own growls. Could someone maybe explain this? "
1684,"Is it feasible to take cat on a 1400 mile, 21+ hour road trip?","I have been thinking about driving from Massachusetts to Florida, but was not sure how feasible it is to do so with a cat. The cat is a vaccinated (to MA standards) inside cat, little less than 2 years old and knows to use her sandbox. My car, on another hand, is a mini SUV.  I am prepared to stop for breaks and even stay overnight in a hotel on my way down, I just am not sure if the trip is practical.  Should I pack the sandbox and some clean sand, and make sure I can find a hotel where I can take the cat into the room? I would be staying in a hotel or some long term apartment in Florida, and the cat would definitely be inside there as well.  Are there any health considerations for the kitty from this kind of change of climate?  How do other people do this sort of trips, or is it not recommended? "
1685,What is the cat owners risk of toxomoplasmosis from cats?,"Do all cat owners have it?  The world prevalence of toxomoplasmosis is 33% so it's extremely common.  Even though it's supposedly asymptomatic and harmless I've read journal articles speculating that the infection can cause personality changes and suicidal behaviour. It literally takes over your brain, and it's permanent. There's no cure.   Since sanitation levels are generally pretty high in western countries, the most common route of transmission is cat poop.  Since cat owners clean cat poop everyday, are they likely to have the disease?  "
1686,Why does the mother cat do this?,"A stray mother cat just had two baby kittens in our apartment complex.  They can't stand or walk or meow yet. They live in the staircase. I've visited them several times to give the mother cat milk. All three are usually snuggled up but when the mother cat sees me, she runs after me.  Why is this? Is she trying to protect the babies by chasing me away? Or does she want food? The cat doesn't hiss, just meows and follows me. And tries to lick my toe.   Btw, there is no SPCA here, and the kittens are warm because it's summer and the nights are hot. Also the kittens are drinking breast milk. Anything else I can do to make them more comfortable?  "
1687,Why does my dog always look sad in photos now that I'm gone?,"My 1.5 year old puppy always looks so depressed in the photos that my parents send  me.  I've been gone 5 months (but visiting next month).  I'm sure I'm not imagining it. I know when he's happy, he looks like he's smiling, open mouth, sparkly eyes, tongue out, huge grin.  In the photos, his mouth is an upside down U.    Does he miss me? Or am I anthropomorphising?  "
1688,Is it possible to keep two small Goldfish in a 2.5 gallon (10 litres) tank?,"I recently purchased two small goldfish for my son. We were instructed by the employee at Petsmart that the 2.5 gal (ca. 10 l) tank would be sufficient. I bought gravel, plants and water conditioner (stress coat).  Anyway, we've only been feeding the fish twice a day, and not excessive amounts of food. Their water looks cloudy, and they keep going to the surface for air. I just changed 50% of the water yesterday afternoon!   I'm frustrated that I spend $40 on these supplies, and from what I'm reading, I don't have a large enough tank. I don't have room for a 20-30 gal (75-115 l) tank. Should I return the fish or is there any way I could make this smaller tank work? Maybe for one fish? "
1689,Why does my cat lick my finger when I am petting her head?,"I just adopted a new cat and I noticed that when I am petting her head, generally she will stop me (with her paw or turning her head toward my hand), lick my thumb or my index finger and let me continue petting her head. My friend told me that this could be because she expects me to bath her while I am petting her head (or somewhat near it).   So my questions is, is this true and why? Or is there another reason why she would randomly lick my finger when I am petting her? "
1690,New roommate's dog tried to bite me. How do I establish that I now belong there?,"I'm currently in the process of moving into a new apartment. My roommate is a stranger who I met on Craigslist, and she has been living in the apartment for the past two years. She has a 6 year old Jack Russell mix.   The first time I came to the apartment to take a look, my roommate-to-be was already outside walking the dog when she greeted me at the parking lot. The dog seemed totally fine.   Today was a different story. I came to the apartment to unload a few boxes. When I walked in, the dog ran up and barked at me like crazy. I basically ignored him, and as my roommate and I started talking, he calmed down a little bit. I noticed him apprehensively giving me the side eye once in awhile. After chitchatting, I went back outside to grab more things. After about 20 minutes, I walked through the door again. The dog runs up and barks again. This time, as I'm carrying a box into my room, he bites my calf. I was wearing stretchy gym pants and mid-walk when he did this, so he got a better grip of my pants than my actual leg (Thank God). I am not sure if he was actually going to bite down. My roommate yelled, ""NO! Go back to mommy's room."" As she apologized, she said that he's normally not like this when she's not home and mentioned that he's a rescue, so his past could potentially be contributing to his behavior.   Several years ago, I lived with another roommate (also a stranger from Craigslist) who also had a dog. This dog would also bark whenever I came home, but ONLY if my roommate was already home. If she wasn't home, the dog would pay me no attention to coming in. During this time, I spent the majority of my time at my boyfriend's house, so it makes sense that this dog never got ""used to me."" I get the sense that my new roommate's dog will also be like this, based on what the roommate said today.   These dogs are obviously territorial and are trying to protect their owners.  I officially move in in two days, and this incident is sort of making me worried. The last thing I want is to live in an environment where I'll be stressed out about coming home because of my roommate's pet.   How do I establish to the dog that I belong there? Will he eventually calm down after he gets used to my presence? My friend, who fosters dogs regularly, said to do so by taking him on long walks a few times, never reward him or acknowledge him when he's behaving that way but instead push him away from me and ignore him. And when he does behave, reward him with a treat. Any other ideas? "
1691,Selling my cockatiel / general inquiries on an allergy,"I had a cockatiel for about 1 month... This is the second one I got.  He is tamed partially (he still bites sometimes but not me; he doesn't really allow touching his back or wings - sometimes he will, sometimes he warns that he will bite)  He got used to the surroundings and 3/4 of the house and all the people around here. He also got used to spending time out of the cage with us and he learned to fly to me when he wants to.  I am afraid now after reading some articles on the Internet about bird powder, because my mother says that his powder causes my sneezing and coughing.  I have been ill for about 2 weeks and I have sore throat. I visited a  doctor and took the medication for 2 weeks, but I still feel ill.  After putting him to sleep, now I feel some difficulty in breathing and I kind of have a blocked nose. I washed it twice but it still didn't seem to fix it. So after reading those articles about allergies and hypersensitivity of bird powder I am afraid to be having these problems.  Finally if I sold it to a pet store I don't feel he would survive after bonding with us like that... A pet store or a new owner won't be the same as here.  That's 2 questions:    Am I sensitive to these powders?   If I have to sell him, would he survive that?   Also I am noticing that he sneezes a lot about 4 repetitive times rapidly then calms down (no discharge). Is there anything wrong?  At first when I got him when he took his first flights around the room his nose became seriously red from the inner... He got injured from the middle of his beak between the nose openings once from hitting the wall (at his first times i noticed he didn't know how to stop). I added disinfectant and flour and he healed yesterday the old part pealed off and he is clean and good to go. "
1692,Can I teach my cat not to eat her treats whole?,"I'm sure I should have asked this sooner, as this was something our cat was doing for months, although we didn't pay attention to this until vomit started to appear in our house.  Long story short, we give two of our cats (Chilli and Luna) some treats once every two days. We limit the amount of treats to around 3-6. Chilli breaks them down with her teeth as usual, however Luna mostly doesn't. We'd often find vomit behind sofa or in the corridor. We concluded that the vomit appearing in our house belongs to Luna. This doesn't happen often, but we are pretty sure it would be due to these treats as we caught her vomit a few times, hours after swallowing the treats. Also, she seems fine other than the occasional vomiting.  Is there a way to teach my cat (Luna) to break down her treats before she eats them? I'm not looking forward to refraining from giving her treats as we'd like to continue to give rewards for activities. Also, the treats in question are about as small as the 'dreamies'. Would giving them bigger treats be a good alternative? "
1693,My dog is limping,"I have a a male Yorkie Poo. He is 6.5 years old. He is in good health, but this morning I woke up and he had a limp. It appears that he is putting less weight on his back right leg. I examined the leg and noticed that there were no cracks or cuts on his paw pads. There was also no noticeable swelling. It does not seem to be bothering him too much because he jumps up onto the couch and off of it still (the height he has to jump is about a foot and a half high. I imagine that if there were a fracture or a break then he would not be able to make this jump? Please correct me if I am wrong on this.  Anyway, I would like to avoid taking him to the vet if I can (but I will if it is a must). What is the best course of action now? I tried to ice his leg but he keeps moving and making it impossible.  "
1694,Can killing a rabbit trigger a behavior change in my dog?,"Dog is an English springer spaniel, male, 7 years old.  I walk him in an overgrown park (dogs are allowed there), he is off the leash during our walks. Occasionally we see a wild rabbit or squirrel. He has chased rabbits numerous times, and I did not mind that. Dog seemed way too slow and rabbits ran into bushes making it impossible for my dog to follow them. My dog is not trained to hunt or chase. I guess it's his breed and nature.  Today he managed to chase down a rabbit and kill it. He bit it, broke rabbit's bones in the process I assume, and left it on the ground. Lost all interest in the rabbit afterwards.  What I wonder about is - can I expect my dog to become more vicious with other dogs now? Small dogs? Or be more interested in hunting?  I know that nothing evil or extraordinary happened. It's the way of the nature. Survival of the fittest. Rabbit we encountered today was not as smart as the ones before. It would have been better if I stopped my dog, but I honestly did not think there is a chance he can get the rabbit. He has chased them for 7 years, never getting close.  I know he tasted blood for first time today, so I will be even more careful with him from now on. "
1695,What to do when a dog has a cold?,It seems our 12 week old puppy has gotten a cold from us.  Our oldest son came home buggered and passed it on to me and put me home for the day. Doggy is here with us and I just noticed her sneezing and with the nose dripping.   Is there anything to do when dogs get a cold?  Is there any medication we should give her (I'm more thinking maybe fruits or something)? 
1696,How to treat a torn iguana toe nail?,"Today when I picked up my iguana I noticed that his nail is almost off his toe but still attached, and there's blood on it, and the toe might be broken because I noticed that he keeps his hands off the ground a lot, because of pain I'm guessing.  I don't know how I'm going to treat him. I can't got to a reptile vet because where I live its illegal to bring reptiles here so we don't have a reptile vet around. I have to treat it myself.   Also he sometimes bites his front legs, is it possible that he pulled it off by himself?  Can anyone please tell how I can treat it?  This is him below.   Update  Good news is, his nail fell of in his own now, I didn't have to pull it off myself. But I still want to know how to treat this injury. Another thing I noticed when I returned him to his cage that he's always lifting his hand up and keeps it up and shakes it! Does shaking his hands or his front leg means that he's in pain or that his toe is broken or is normal?! I really not much of an expert i just had him for couple of weeks. And he's my first reptile.  Below is a picture of his toes.  "
1697,What is causing this muscular seizing in my cat?,"Background  My cat, Polar, is a very amiable calico. This past January (2016) or so, Polar started having these episodes where suddenly her two right paws would seize up, being pulled towards her torso, and half a beat later she is fine. We thought it would sort itself out. By late February, we started being concerned. These episodes got worse,instead of stumbling, she would fall. When she seized, her right side paws would be yanked tightly against her torso. At this point, there was no affect on her left side. She would fall, two seconds later, she gets up without acknowledging anything happened. In early March, we took her to the vet. He didn't witness any episodes, said it wasn't seizures, and that she was very healthy. By late April, the intensity of the episodes plateaued. They only last 3 or 4 seconds. Her right legs are pulled against her torso, her left legs forcibly extended straight down, and her face clenches. Unfortunately the frequency has increased from 5 per week (Feb) to 1 per hour now (May). I know cats are tough and don't show pain, so I'm not sure how much these episodes hurt. What is really bad is the falling. She falls off of stuff all the time (less than 4 ft high) and hits the ground like a rock because she is in an episode. She has a scab above her eye from one of these falls. Right now we don't have stairs, but we are moving soon to a house with 2 flights. What can I do to fix/alleviate this? If I can't fix it, what would be a sign that I should put her to sleep?  Problem Description  My cat, Polar, goes through episodes where her muscles seize, however they are not seizures. Here is what I can discern about them:   Triggers: When she wakes up, when she gets up to fast, when she is startled, when she goes from walking to running, when she jumps onto something Duration: 3-4 seconds of where the muscles are taut, then 1-2 seconds before she gets up and moves on Characteristics: She is consistently contorted in the same way, she does not try to avoid the triggers, she is not defensive afterwards,      Details  Here are some details about Polar and her life that may or may not be relevant:   Videos of two episodes are here and here Age is at least 9 years. We found her under a shed in the middle of a snow storm 9 years ago, she looked like an older kitten. Desexed, front paws are Declawed, lives strictly Indoors and for the past 3 years she has been our only cat (she hates other cats) Diet is heathly dry cat food (we switch to a different brand in March to see if that helped) and filtered water Medical History is minimal she is probably not up-to-date with shots or anything like that. We've never had any problems with her besides last summer (2015). She would get a scab on her chest from scratching or something and would proceed to go full-on OCD grooming herself trying to get her fur smooth, which would enlarged the wound. She did this several (more than 10 less than 20) times. She also caught a bat in our house (Fall 2014) once. Also the knobs on the back of her ankles on her rear legs are bald because she chews that them regularly.   What I've tried Here is everything we've tried so far:   Vet: Took her to the vet. She is healthy and not having seizures. Diet Change: We changed food brands to see if it would fix it, no discernible effect Research: We've tried researching what the problem could be, could not find anything. Every search with muscles/seizing turns up seizures. I'm at the end of my rope on what to look into. Networking: We've talked to long-time cat owners, vets/vet assistants that we know and they didn't have any ideas.   Conclusion  We are concerned that when we move next week to a house with stairs, that she could seriously injure herself (we can't block off the stairs from her). Another worry is that this condition could escalate to a point where she would have to be put down for her own good. Any ideas on how to fix/alleviate these episodes? How do I discern when to we should put her to sleep?    Update  On January 24th 2017, we put Polar to sleep. Within a year of first showing symptoms, she would have episodes as frequently as 10/hour and started having them while sleeping.  "
1698,Does the cat know it's a game?,"My cat particularly likes it when I bring out the cat-teaser (essentially a fake 'bird' on a stick). He makes a great deal of effort in catching it, and I assume he's enjoying himself.  Now my question is, what's going through the cat's mind? Does he know it's a game/practice for hunting, and is enjoying himself, or does he actually think he's hunting something he can't really eat - and therefore a disappointing waste of time?  I sometimes consider whether I should feed him a treat or something after playing with him to give him the whole experience of the hunt - if it's the latter case. "
1699,How many gold fish can i have in my tank?,"I have a 320litre tank and at the moment i have one tiny catfish (not much bigger that a tetra) a very little bristle nose, 10 small goldfish and one larger one. He measures about 6cm. How many... ( if any ) more fish can i safely add to this tank?? Any opinions appreciated 😊 "
1700,Are loud sounds/music more dangerous for a dog's hearing than a humans?,"I have a pretty good stereo system at the house, and I like to listen to my music and movies at a loud volume, but one not particularly dangerous for humans: typically 80-90dB, possibly with peaks around 95-105dB for gunshots/explosions in movies. I'm well versed in OSHA's hearing duration recommendations, and as someone suffering from some high-frequency hearing loss due to loud concerts 20 years ago, I make very sure not to do further damage to myself.  OSHA guidelines for max listening time without causing damage:   I have a dog who loves to lay near my feet while I'm listening to music, or watching movies. My wife is concerned that ""the music is too loud for the dog!"" and constantly asking me to turn it down.  Obviously dogs have more sensitive hearing than humans, but from my understanding of how sound and hearing works, all that means is that they've got a greater High Freq. range and can hear softer sounds than humans can. It doesn't seem to mean that sounds feel/are twice as loud for dogs than humans. Unfortunately trying to find information about this online seems to conclude that this is the general consensus... but of course no one has any proof, just repeating the rote ""dogs hearing is more sensitive"" line with no explanation of why that would be bad. To me that's argument makes as much sense as saying that dogs/cats have more sensitive eyesight so we ought to dim the lights so we don't hurt their eyes... which obviously isn't the case.  My dog doesn't seem to mind and happily goes to sleep right beside me during a movie at loud volume, while still going crazy when he hears a neighbor talking in their yard across the street (i.e. his hearing is fine). I'm of the opinion that if it was actually causing damage to him, he'd move to a different room.  Have there been any actual studies on this? Is loud music more dangerous for a dog than a human? Could the fatigue contribute to future deafness in my dog? Should I turn the volume down or is everything fine? "
1701,Why is my guppy being aggressive and not giving birth?,"I had one male and two female guppies. A little more than a month ago, the male died because he was bitten a lot by the females. Maybe there was another reason as well. The female was impregnated by him and still hasn't given birth more than a month later. She looks pregnant, but not ready yet. She also attacks the other female guppy and chases her away from food. They are in a well-planted 5 gallon take. I recently put the female in a separate tank so that there is less stress. Will she ever give birth? Why is she acting strangely?  "
1702,When is coronavirus leading to FIP contagious?,"I adopted two middle-aged (or older?) cats from the same shelter 3.5 years ago.  Both were healthy until recently when one developed FIP.  Since I adopted them they have had no contact with other cats, aside from whatever happens behind the scenes at the vet's office.  According to this article from the Cornell Veterinary School, a cat can be exposed to the virus (with no symptoms) and develop FIP years later.  So it sounds like it's possible that my cat came to me already infected and the disease only manifested now.  (It's also possible that the other cat is a carrier who transmitted it to him without getting sick himself.)  When is a cat with future-FIP infectious?  Only during an initial exposure to coronavirus (when my cat caught this), or from that time onward?  Only after developing FIP?  If a cat has been exposed to coronavirus in the past but has never shown symptoms of FIP, can he transmit that coronavirus to other cats?  I am trying to figure out the effect of this on my remaining cat, and whether I can safely adopt another cat to join him.  There is no reliable test for FIP other than biopsies, so at best testing can tell us if he's been exposed to coronavirus (the test looks for the antibodies). But my biggest concern is whether he could be infectious.  (If he's also infected then, sadly, there's nothing we can do about that.  We can only test for coronavirus and coronavirus doesn't always lead to FIP from what I've read.) "
1703,Why does my dog push my crotch while I'm sleeping?,"I have 6 dogs, the new dog will cover my crotch while sleeping... not a huge issue I guess but she uses her nose and sometimes pushes HARD. I heard they do that with food. Does she think my crotch is food? Is she trying some weird dominate thing?she will grab whatever is in reach and pile it up. "
1704,How to treat grass to prevent brown spots,"We have 3 small dogs and live in a rental home.  We recently built a dog run on the side of our house, to keep the dogs safe when they go out to pee at night and in the morning.  We have coyotes in the neighborhood and several neighborhood pets have become victims.  Unfortunately, this means that all their pee is being concentrated in a relatively small area (about 10x6 feet).  The grass is all dying due to the concentrated urine.  What's the best method to keep the grass alive?  Is there anything i can put on the grass that's not harmful to the dogs that will prevent it from dying?  The grass gets a bit of water from the sprinkler system but it doesn't seem to be enough.  Unfortunately, the area where the dog run is located is very far from the nearest hose.  If more water to dilute the urine is really the only method then I suppose I can invest in a long hose. "
1705,Using glass pipe,I want to use glass pipe instead of a regular fitting for bottom drain of my aquarium.  for example 10cm of glass pipe that glued to the bottom hole of aquarium using silicon sealant and the end of it connected to a hose that can go to sump...  am i going to have leakage problem or anything? anyone ever tried glass pipes in aquariums? 
1706,Integrating a Kitten - Miaoing back,"We've recently gotten a (10 week old) kitten and we're trying to integrate her into the household. There is already an adult cat in the house, but we haven't arrived at the point of introducing them yet - we're just trying to get the kitten to get used to her new environment.  She's currently locked in her own room, with food, water, toys, litter, and a ton of hiding spaces.  On the first day she didn't even move from her hiding place - not even if we were in the room. She didn't eat or drink anything.  Second day, she started moving between hiding places when we weren't in the room, and the food (we've given her 5 different kinds, it looks like a buffet in there) appears to have been touched - so I think she's eating.  It's the mid of the third day, and from time to time she does long and consistent miaoing sprees. At this point we're trying to leave her mostly alone and talking to her only when when we feed her.  Now today, during feeding time she started miaoing from her hiding place. As an experiment we miaoed back and she looked interested. As the miaoing continued back and forth she abandoned her hiding place, took a sniff and lay down on my wife's lap.  I'm not sure what to make of this. Is this good for her - we're making her feel more comfortable? Or are we confusing/taunting her and it'll be worse for her in the long term?  So the question is - should we continue miaoing back or should we just ignore her? Should we be doing anything in response to her miaoing?  "
1707,Racoons: What sort of protection do my rabbit enclosure need?,I have two dwarf rabbits in an enclosure in the backyard.   Some time ago I heared about some rabbits catched by a group of racoons. (In a place some away. Here I havend heared about or seen racoons.)  What protection do my rabbits need? (They will not come indoors.)  Especially I need information about the power of racoons: How smart and how strong are they? And what material can resist them?   (Today my rabbits have an enclosure with this protection: What boundaries are necessary for outdoor rabbits? ) 
1708,"My Dog and my Cats have fleas, and Im getting Bites, Is there an infestation?","Both my Border Collie Dog and my 2 Cats, are getting fleas, we noticed from the immense Itching.

1710,Cockatiel's lack of body feathers under the wings,"So, I recently got a 10-month male cockatiel, which is very happy and has very healthy feathers.  He has very good relationship with me, often climbs me and lowers his head for petting and scratching. He also has normal relationship with my female cockatiel: They are just keeping a little distance from each other, but don't fight.  My cockatiels are not in a cage. They are free in their own room with lots of food, drinking water, and bathing water.  Anyway. A few days after I purchased the male cockatiel, I noticed something strange when he was preening: he has very little feathers on his body under his wings. I didn't check his body feathers when I was in the shop, as he had quite healthy feathers everywhere else.  So, I watched him carefully for over a week, to make sure that he does not pluck his feathers. I also noticed that there are no plucked feathers on the floor; at least nothing beyond what's usually left from preening.     Is there a reason to worry? Should I show my cockatiel to an avian vet?  "
1711,How to moderate dominant instinct between cats?,"I've two cats, male and female. They are twins, 2 years old, half Bengal and half Siamese. They are sterilized.  The female is very nice. Never annoying anyone. The male always tries to keep attention, often scratching furniture, etc.  At sleep time, they are allowed to come in our bedroom. But most of time, the male does not allow the female to come with us. He acts as if it is his territory. Even if I try to get her with us, she won't stay.  So the little one is often alone and I'm quite sure she lacks proximity with us.   Globally, the male appears to be the dominant one and I'd like to moderate that, so things can be more equilibrate between them.  What can I do about that? How to understand what they respectively really feel?  Thanks for any advice.  Additional information:   The cats are indoor only We live at fifth floor and going outside is dangerous but we could give them about 60m² outside (but they could go everywhere on the roofs around, included in other apartments, so they could be trapped or they could fall) Everyday, we (my wife and I) spend about an hour and half dedicated to the cats We work at home. The cats are rarely alone They have about 100m² inside + Hicat tower (floor to ceiling tower, climbable and scratchable) so they can climb and play ""vertically""  Please ask any additional question needed so that I can have a solution or orientation   Thanks "
1712,What was my dog trying to communicate with this part-howl while meeting new people on a walk?,"I'm guessing that's a tricky question to answer, so I'm going to provide lots of details.  Thanks for your patience!     tl/dr: I was out for a walk with all of my kids.  My dog does well   with kids (small children in large numbers visit us frequently)   but less well with grown men.  While walking by a yard full of kids, a   2 year old came up quickly and gave him a friendly scratch on the neck.  My dog   didn't seem to mind (or at least didn't react strongly).  The child's   father came up a moment later and picked up the child.  A few moments   later my dog gave out two short and low ""howls"" (I'm not sure exactly what   sound he was making).  I didn't notice anything off in his body   language during the encounter.  Any guesses what he might have been   communicating?   My dog and people  My dog is effectively my first dog, so I'm not a dog whisperer by any means, and I'm trying to understand him here.  He's an elderly (~10 years old) rescue, weighs about 75 pounds, he seems to mainly be American Bulldog, he's been with us for not quite a year, and he seems to have otherwise spent his whole life chained up in someone's back yard.  Despite that last fact, he is actually fairly well adjusted to people and does very well with small children.  The ""incident"" in question happened on a walk, but he mainly meets new people while at home (he definitely has a ""guard dog"" aspect to his personality) so I figured I'd explain how that usually goes.  We're a larger family (5 kids, aged 0-11) and especially with the recent birth of our youngest, have had lots of people over in recent months, including many families that also have 4 or 5 young children.  He does great with our kids, and has never shown any hints of aggression towards them, even when they accidentally hurt him (which doesn't happen much).  He's always been very friendly with women and children visiting our house, although in the early days he would sometimes let out a low growl when first meeting new people in our home (typically while wagging his tail, sniffing them, and otherwise displaying a curious/excited body language).  I would scold him for the growling, he would stop (or I would put him up if he didn't), and (in my non-expert opinion) he was never considering hurting everyone.  Even during visits which started with a growl, he would be perfectly fine after a few minutes and would play with everyone - happily accepting pets and scratches from the new people just like our kids.  Over the past few months especially we have had even more people over (mainly because of people coming over to help with the baby), and during this time he's stopped growling at new people all together.  The only time we have problems is with guys, which doesn't happen very often.  I had someone come over to do some work on the house and the guy's son came in first (he was probably 18-20).  For a minute our dog was fine like always, but suddenly started barking at him (I think the worker walked by one of our kids and might have made the dog uncomfortable).  I put the dog up until everyone was done so that the workers didn't have to worry.  Out for a walk  The other day all the kids, the dog, and I were out for a walk and passed a family playing in their yard.  This happens often in our neighborhood.  Sometimes I cross the street in case I think our dog might make someone nervous (since he's on the larger side), but we're typically ignored by whoever is outside, and our dog is usually more interested in sniffing the grass, so I don't always.  This time there were about 4 kids, mainly playing on the sidewalk.  They went back into their yard as we slowly came up, and I didn't think to cross the street (my kids had run a bit ahead, so mainly I was just following them)  These new kids were in the grass just to the right of the sidewalk, and my dog was on the left side sniffing as he went along.  There was a very young kid (maybe not even quite 2 years old) that I didn't notice, and he ""broke away"" from his family and toddled up to my dog quite quickly.  The father was standing near by and told his son to stop, but of course he kept walking.  Little ones can be surprisingly quick, and a moment later he walked right up to my dog, reached up, and scratched him on the neck.  The father came up a moment later and swooped up his son.  I don't think I would have had time to do anything if I had thought to, although I wouldn't have been worried even if I had time to think about it.  My dog just stood there calmly while the boy scratched him.  The encounter was very quick, but I didn't notice any change in my dog's body language to suggest he was upset.  The father looked mildly panicked so I stopped for a moment to let him know that our dog is very used to little children, and that his youngest son was never in any danger.  While I was talking my dog let out a low ""howl"" sound.  I'm not actually sure how to describe it.  It definitely wasn't a bark or a growl.  He did it twice.  Sort of a deep ""how how"" sound while tilting his head up a bit.  A moment later we continued our walk.  I have never heard him do this before, so I'm not sure what he was trying to say.  I'm guessing it was an expression of mild dislike about something in the encounter, whether it was the crowd of kids, being scratched without warning, or the father coming near him suddenly.  I figure it's hard to say for sure, but I'd like to have a good guess so I know how to act in such situations in the future (aka just cross the street and avoid them).  Any thoughts as to what my dog might have been saying? "
1713,Can I fill my aquarium with the water from a purifier?,I only have a bore well in my home so I bought an 8 stage water purifier with RA And UV which adds minerals to the water. The final water TDS Is 44. I'm keeping tropical fish such as guppies and Angel fish.   Can I use it to fill my aquarium / Fish Pond? Will it cause any problems for the fish? 
1714,Cat siblings suddenly fallen out with each other,"We have a couple of two year old male neutered cats, Ed and George, who have lived with us since they were kittens. Until yesterday, they were on exceptionally good terms, and would play, groom, and sleep together, and generally do things as a pair.  They are house cats, but we do give them a couple of hours of supervised time in the garden each day. It was during one of these outdoor sessions yesterday that the problems started: Ed suddenly became aggressive, and decided to chase George into the house out of our sight. From this point on, George has barely appeared from under the bed, and whenever Ed approaches, he hisses and growls. On the other hand, shortly after the initial attack, Ed returned to his normal self, and appears to be unfazed by George. He keeps attempting to make contact with his brother under the bed, but is constantly rejected.  To assign human emotions to them, it looks like George is now scared, and Ed is confused about his brother's behaviour. However, I know that this might not be a true reading of their 'thought processes'.  This situation has now been ongoing for around 24 hours.  A theory we have as to why Ed initially became aggressive is that it was a case of mistaken identity: there are other cats on the street, and we wonder if he detected the smell or sound of another cat nearby, but then mistook his brother for a rival. We think this has happened once before, but without lasting consequences. However, it is a guess on this occasion as we never saw any other cats during the incident.  Why would two otherwise loving cats suddenly turn on each other? Is it possible that George is now too scared of Ed to be around him? Or is it more likely that Ed is trying to obtain a dominant position? And how can we return back to the status quo in this sort of situation? "
1715,pet mouse just started biting,"We've had Winston for just about a year, we got him as a baby.   When we got him we already had two grown mice (all caged separately but next to each other) and all was well. We (my son and I) held/hold our mice for an hour each day and they come straight out each time and don't want to be put back at the end.   In march we lost our two older mice over the same weekend and Winston definitely noticed they were gone. We continued to hold him each day for an hour but he was always on the side of his cage and seemed to be looking for Hamilton.   A couple of weeks ago we got a new mouse Wilbur and put him in Hamilton's old cage. Winston freaked out and ever since, even though we hold Winston first and keep him away from Wilbur and his smells, he has started biting A LOT. Winston was used to other mice before but and he seems to be fine with Wilbur now when they both meet up on the side of their cages together but he is still biting me (my son is afraid to hold him). He even tries to reach around the treats to bite my finger through the bars when we give treats during non-holding times.  He seems squirly in general, he is less than a year old and this is his first spring, is it mating season or something?  How do I get him to calm down and stop biting?  Thanks "
1716,How to handle pet cat's prey when they're injured,"So I have a three year old male cat that I took in from a shelter. It wasn't long before he started bringing in mice, shrews, birds and once, a rabbit. I accept it's a part of their nature to do this but I'm not entirely sure how to ethicially(?) handle injured animals.   If they're barely moving I'll kill them myself quickly but when he brings in a mouse that's pretty mobile albeit with a wound, I've just been taking it back outside and putting it into the field across the road.  Is there a better way to deal with this? I feel like I'm simply prolonging the inevitable and the animal will die of injection or suffer another more prolonged death. Or do I simply accept this is nature and try not to let it bother me? "
1717,Preparing a dog to stay alone without crating,"I have a 6 month old ridgeback who has been crate trained since I got him as a puppy.  His house training is going well and I am prepared to start trusting him with a bit more freedom around the house.  I'd like to work up so that I don't have to crate him when I go to work.  Currently he is crated for about 4 hours when I go to work in the morning until lunch, when I take him for a walk and play for a bit, then another 4 hours till I get home at night.  Though he understands being locked in the crate, when I leave him free in another room with the door closed, he begins to whine and bark (similar to what he did when he was first crate training).  I've done my best to puppy proof the area but I am still afraid he will find something to destroy out of frustration.  Are there any tricks for helping bring a puppy to this next stage of house-proofing?  Is it similar to crate training where I will need to start short and just continually work up to longer and longer times alone? "
1718,What do I have to consider before getting a sugar glider as a pet?,"I am thinking about getting a sugar glider as a pet. What are the main issues I should think about before getting one? Also, I am planning to buy a dog (boxer) later on when we move to a bigger home, will the sugar glider and dogs get along? "
1719,Why do cats enjoy playing in cardboard boxes?,"Whenever I bring a box home, or I get a package in the mail, both of my cats immediately have to inspect it thoroughly. As soon as it's empty, they'll be playing games with it: jumping in and out, guarding it from the other, etc. If I toss a toy into a box, they'll drop whatever they're doing to immediately get the toy. I've noticed that they'll even grab one of their toys to bring it into the box to play with.  Why do cats love sleeping on cardboard? doesn't explain why cats play with cardboard as mine do. My cats sleep on the bed with me; they don't sleep in the boxes except for a few occasions where they wear themselves out and don't feel like leaving the box to sleep.  Their playing reminds me of kids playing with their imaginations, turning boxes into spaceships and things like that. What is it about boxes that cats enjoy?   "
1720,How should I handle a dog when I catch it chewing a shoe?,"When I hear my dog(s) chewing something in another room, I sometimes go to take a look at what it is they are working on. In case it is a shoe, what immediate action should I take to stop the chewing in such a way as to not reward the dog with attention?  The answers to remedy this sock-stealing dog explain how the dog may perceive a response as a reward/attention, especially if you start chasing after the sock.  I can imagine how that dog might never stop stealing socks or chewing shoes because of this ""reward"".  In the case of a good shoe being chewed, I simply cannot ignore the chewing.  So, what is the proper way to react to stop a dog caught in the act of chewing a shoe? "
1721,How can I best clean my cat's drooling mouth without making things worse?,"I have read How can I best manage the drooling from my sick cat? and I'm looking for a way to alleviate my cat's pain.    My cat is 22m and has been drooling for the last couple weeks.  His vet has prescribed antibiotics and pain reliever, but the drooling has not stopped.  I try to clean his face using soft tissues whenever I see him drool, but I realize that his skin may be very irritated and painful from the drooling.  I'm looking for any kind of relief for my baby.  Because his appetite has slowed, I have been supplementing feeding him via a syringe.  While this seems to eliminate some of the drooling, he has also been making a swallowing action (kind of the way I feel when my allergies and post nasal drip run amok).  Feeding him via a syringe seems to make this worse.    I have started cleaning his face daily with water, and then dabbing a bit of antiseptic / anesthetic wash to help kill any germs and numb the pain.  I have a followup with his vet for Saturday, but in the meantime, what is the best way to clean drool from my cat's chin and face, and how frequently? "
1722,Is it healthy for newborn puppies to live on direct land?,"My dog Jamie (no breed) had 4 puppies on July 8th. They haven't opened their eyes as of yet.  Prior to this, Jamie dug a hole in the ground in the yard and there she gave birth to her puppies.  While it's true that in the hole they are 'safe' so that my other dog (boxer of 5 years) can not hurt them, I think it is not healthy for the puppies that live there.   Today I took one of them out of the hole and I realized that the puppy had 3 pebbles in its mouth, and I took them out. The puppies are directly in contact with the land and hence they practically breathe nothing but dirt, I mean they get no fresh air.  My question is: Is it healthy that puppies live there? Could puppies get an allergy because of being in the dirt constantly?  Should I take them out and 'build' them a little house (so they would be in a cleaner place) and where they would be protected as well?  Should I leave them in the hole?  If not, what should I do? "
1723,"Male cat harassing his sister, causing her to hiss","We adopted two cats together, a brother and a sister, about a year and a half ago from a rescue organization. They are both spayed / neutered and are probably about 1 year 8 months old. The sister is ~ 2lbs lighter than her brother  About six months ago we noticed that when they would play the female cat would begin hissing, yowling, and taking swipes at him. Sometimes this happens because the male cat is harassing her - chasing her around, biting at her heels a bit when she runs away until we separate them.  But it also happens when she instigates and it seems like they're playing normally.  There's never any 'puffing up' or back arching, but she's clearly upset and claws at him to get him to back off.  Recently we came home after about four days away (we had a cat sitter visit daily for a couple hours, but they obviously weren't getting as much attention as when we're home full time) and found that the male cat had a small scratch by his ear, so it seems like it has escalated.   Does anyone know why she's getting so upset? Is hissing normal during play?  Also, is our stopping the male cat from chasing his sister inadvertently encouraging him to continue doing it, since he gets attention for it? If so, how can we make sure she feels safe without giving him attention?  "
1724,Is this DIY doggy bath wipe safe?,"My friend babysat my 6 month old bulldog puppy and used a DIY dog bath wipes. The recipe was 2 to 3 cups of water, 1 tablespoon of ""my pet's friend"" oatmeal enhanced deodorizing shampoo, 1/4 cup coconut oil organic and 1 drop of pure tea tree oil.  My dog is licking himself after she wiped him down. Should I take him to the vet? Will he get sick? Is this DIY toxic? Thank you. "
1725,Do non neutered cats shed more hair?,I recently had a discussion with a pet owner and he claimed that non neutered male cats shed more hair due to anxiety. Is it true?  I have been feeding him high quality food but within a few days his hair grow and shortly afterwards he starts shedding too much.  What is the cause? 
1726,How long does it take for a worm to die after a toad eats it?,"Recently got a pet toad, and I am wondering at what point after feeding meal worms do the worms die?  I noticed that they are definitely still squirmy when in his mouth and he swallows them whole. Worms can also survive for several weeks under water provided there is sufficient oxygen in the water to support them, which means the only way they are dying is via . So how long does it take the worms to be sufficiently digested to the point where they stop moving? "
1727,Besides collar where else can I put name tag on my cat?,"One of my kitten is leaving me. I want to put either a name tag or a GPS tracker.  However, I fear that a collar may get him ""stuck"" on some places or even killing him.  I've heard that there is a harness or something. Would that work? Would that be better? "
1728,What could happen if my 3 year old boxer does not reproduce?,"I have a 3 year old male boxer and until now I have not find him a partner to reproduce with.

I have not notice anything weird in his behaviour.  "
1729,How to react to a mouse biting?,"A friend just got a pair of fancy mice for her children. They are trying to get the mice accustomed to the humans, and my friend said one mouse already bit her, ""but it didn't hurt too much"".   I've had mice before and know that they can bite strong enough to draw blood. I also have made the mistake of not teaching a cat to not bite humans when he was tiny and his bites were cute; we couldn't re-educate him as an adult. So, if mice have the ability to learn to not bite, I think it will be in my friend's interest to try to teach them. She told me she is not sure how she should react, but I didn't feel qualified to give advice.   Should my friend try to train them to not bite humans, or is this impossible with mice? If she can train them, what approach can work? If she can't train them, how should she behave? Ignore the bite? Put a distance between herself and the mouse?   She mentioned that the mice are already losing some of their anxiety towards the humans, and she thinks the bite was exploratory behavior, not defense.  "
1730,What kind of food should I stuff into a Kong?,"I bought a pair of Kong toys (see photo) for my puppy, who's home alone when I'm at work. I usually feed him 3 times a day (going back home at lunchtime). The goal is to gradually reduce the ""lunch"" quantity and to leave him a Kong to play with in the afternoon.  So the question is: what is the best way to stuff the Kong with his food?  He's eating dry kibble.  To make it more fun and for the Kong to last longer, I'm thinking about freezing the Kong, but of course the kibble won't freeze.  I've seen this Youtube video about frozen Kongs, but they use wet canned food, which I would like to avoid (especially in these ""large"" quantities). So how should I proceed?  I could stuff it with the kibble and then ""seal"" the Kong with something that will freeze...   To make it both fun and healthy for the dog, how would you proceed ?   "
1731,Why is it a bad idea to touch bloodworms with your bare hands?,"I feed my sunfish frozen bloodworms, and I was told that touching the bloodworms is a really bad idea; that they carry some terrible bacteria that can be transferred to humans. I tried looking up why you're not supposed to touch bloodworms, and all I found were people saying that if they touch bloodworms, they have an allergic reaction.  Is it true that touching bloodworms is a bad idea for more reasons than the risk of an allergic reaction? Or is it okay as long as you don't have a reaction? "
1732,"Does the United States have requirements or certifications to be classified as an ""Exotic Animal Veterinarian""?","An answer from How can I gauge a vet&#39;s experience with reptiles? mentions The Association of Exotic Mammal Veterinarians, which as best I can tell is a membership organization, not a certifying organization.  They have some great goals, and I see that one of my favorite rabbit vets is a listed member, but a second, very good, rabbit vet is not.  According to Wikipedia, interest in treating exotic pets is the first criteria; additional training and certifications are secondary.  Is there any official certification I should be looking when evaluating a potential exotics vet?  If so, what level of competence does it imply? "
1733,How does one determine when a female dog is appropriate to be spayed?,"We have What is the optimal age to neuter a male dog? , but nothing about spaying female dogs.  I have heard several options about when to spay a female dog; most revolve around the age of 6 months, though I have heard earlier and later, and some options are based on a minimal weight.  What is the correct way to determine when a female dog is qualified to be spayed? "

1735,How can I best manage a teething puppy?,"My puppy is 4.5 months old, and he's teething. His gums are quite red and irritated.  I provide him with different chew toys (only 1-2 of them at the same time, changing every day). I also give him a stuffed frozen Kong in the afternoon and a frozen Kong puppy teething stick.   Am I doing the right thing? Is there anything else I can do? Is teething painful for the puppy, and if so, how can we manage the discomfort and pain?  "
1736,Are enzyme treatments more effective than vinegar for removing rabbit urine?,"In this answer, I was directed to use an enzyme treatment like ""Natures Miracle"" on my rabbit's pee stains.  To date, I've always used vinegar, which seemed to work well.  Enzyme treatments are more expensive than vinegar.  Are enzyme treatments more effective at cleaning than vinegar? Are they effective enough to justify the cost differential? "
1737,Why are cats afraid of vacuums?,"My cats are pretty stereotypically afraid of my vacuum. As soon as they see me getting ready to use it, they'll jump up.  The second it gets turned on, they're bolting to the other room.  I watch movies and play video games that make sudden loud noises, so it doesn't seem likely to me that the vacuum is scary because it's loud. Is there something else about the noise that's scary?  I was thinking maybe the frequency was at a certain level that only bothers cats, like how humans can't hear dog whistles.  What is it about vacuums that are so scary? "
1738,"Dirty cat ears, is it mites?","I have a kitten. When I got him, he had a lot of black wax in his ears, it looked like mites. We went to vet, and he just cleaned his ears with cotton soaked in something and said that it wasn't mites, he didn't even check the wax under microscope.   After that I see my cat scratching ears few times a day, it has like 2-3 dots of black wax in ears.   Before I got him, he lived in house and outside.

1741,Is Rehmannia safe for dogs? Is it effective for arthritis?,"Our 8 year old dog - a suspected doberman/labrador mix - has recently been diagnosed with arthritis in his back and rear legs. Our veterinarian has prescribed Rimadyl, which has seemed to help his movement some when we give it to him. However, he has had gastrointestinal problems (ongoing gurgling, diarrhea, etc.) when taking the drug. Furthermore, researching Rimadyl has us concerned about long term, irreversible effects to his GI system or liver, especially since he doesn't seem to tolerate the drug well.  A friend suggested Rehmannia, an herbal remedy that she said is safe and effective for treating canine arthritis. My friend referred me to a website to learn more about it, but the website discusses stuff like Qi, and balancing Yin &amp; Yang; stuff I don't put much stock into. My own search attempts have turned up some reviews (mostly positive, but some negative ... and some irrelevant to our situation (i.e. treating other conditions)) of the product, but no clinical studies.

1743,My koi fishes are dying every day,"It all started last week. My big koi started to spin out of control and died the same day. I went to the pond place and they gave me a parasite treatment bottle, with instructions to use it for 3 days. I used it for 2 days, then had to go away for 2 days. When I came back no one looked sick. I applied one more dose because I thought it had to be used for 3 days total.  The next day 2 fish died; they didn't look like anything was wrong with them. I called the pond place, and they told me not to use any more medicine until something went wrong. Today another fish died suddenly. They don't have anything on them at all. They just isolate themselves and then they die.  My question is, can I reapply the blue spectrum medicine again? And do it for 3 days again? Or is that going to harm the fish? Am I dealing with a parasite or a bacteria?  The other fish are swimming kind of fast, not like normal. The pH was fine, ammonia fine, and the change water looks clear.   "
1744,What is my risk of getting Toxoplasmosis from my neighbors cat?,"Toxoplasmosis is a parasitic disease it is most commonly spread in feces by household cats., the related question What is the cat owners risk of toxomoplasmosis from cats? has an answer that indicates no correlation between owning cats and contracting toxomoplasmosis..  Anyone with a garden and a neighbor with an outdoor cat knows that the cat is attracted to the garden for it's litter box potential.  The cat owner interacts with cat feces mostly in the home litter box where they expect it and deal with it appropriately. The garden owner, interacts with cat feces by accidental discovery or even without being aware that they have come in contact with cat feces.  Does a non-cat owner, gardener, living near outdoor (tame or feral) cat have an increase risk of toxomoplasmosis as compared to a person without accidental exposure to domestic cat feces? If so what is the increase level of risk?   Related sister site question: Is spent cat litter an appropriate source of nitrogen for compost? "
1745,Rabbit Eating Dog Food,My rabbit has been eating dog food for 2 weeks now. I can't explain why but I'm just wondering if it is ok for her to eat it.

1746,"In giving my cat a ""space"" (bed) on my desk, should I strictly enforce that she stay there only?","After reading answers to a question on this site about a cat being problematic on a desk, I followed advice there and gave my kitten her own space on my desk:    And I have gotten the message to her that when air-powered keyboard-duster blows, that means she's gonna get puffed if she doesn't get in that bed. Kitty doesn't like the puff, so she goes.   But for some reason, as shown above, she likes to lay on the desk instead sometimes. I dont really mind her there - she isn't bothering me. But when she gets up and walks on my keyboard, that does bother me.   Is:     It's ok for you to lay [here] and [here] but not to ever step on [this]   too complicated of a message to send a cat? Will this be too confusing?  Should I strictly enforce that she stay in her bed when on the desk to avoid confusion? Or can a cat handle ""two places are OK, but the other one is not""? "
1747,How can I provide supplements to an Ocelot gecko who won't eat dusted crickets?,"Our ocelot gecko had some problem with a dusted cricket when he was very young (he vomited it for some reason) and since then he won't even look at crickets that have been dusted with calcium and vitamins. We are trying to compensate by giving him small amounts of vitamins/calcium with a little water on the tip of his nose, so that he'll lick it, a method he finds very annoying.    I a have pretty hard time looking for something I could feed to the crickets so that they contain enough calcium and D3. The only things I was able to find in my area are variants of dry calcium vitamins mixes for dusting.  Are there any alternatives I could use to make sure that my gecko will get all of the nutrients he needs? Such as a way to feed crickets naturally? I try to feed them cheese or curd but that won't solve the vitamin issue.  Or does anybody have similar experience with a gecko rejecting dusted insects, and know of some way to make them more appealing so that he'll start eating them again? "
1748,I don't understand crate training. What am I missing?,"Kennel training is driving me crazy. I have read article after article on the subject and I have a few unanswered questions. For example, I see a LOT of people saying that you need to take your puppy outside after playing, eating, napping, ect... so when exactly are they NOT outside?  It seems like everyone's answers are to have your puppy outside to pee 24/7 so that is really confusing to me. Also, my 8 week old puppy (who I have been trying to kennel train for a little over a week) does go to the bathroom in her kennel. She pees in it. By the way she is a chiweenie pup... very clingy and in my face.  At first I put her in the kennel with a blanket over it and she cried a lot but eventually fell asleep. So when she woke up whining I figured I should take her to potty since she had just been sleeping and that's a suggestion for when to take them out, right? It seemed ok, but she was also peeing in her kennel even though she would go outside too.  Now she seems to have learned that if she cries I'll take her outside and she cries every hour. How am I supposed to know when to take her out and when she is just trying to get out of her kennel?  Next thing I'm really frustrated about is that I HAVE to be outside with her. She wont eat or drink or use the bathroom or play if I'm not out there with her. When will she (if ever) feel comfortable enough with being outside alone to do these things? Even when I sit outside with her while she runs around, mostly she just wants to sit on my lap instead of doing her business. She is SOOO clingy.  I love my puppy and I'm not trying to complain or make anyone think I'm not really trying, but I also believe that a dog is a dog and not a child and shouldn't be treated like a helpless baby all the time. Many dogs never get to go in their owners houses and are still good, loving dogs. I'm just so frustrated. Can anyone explain crate training to me better? Not just to take the puppy outside after eating, drinking, playing, chewing, training, sleeping, etc.? "
1749,How much space do cats need when living indoors?,"When keeping pets that live in terrariums or aquariums, it's common to consider the minimum amount of space they need in their enclosure in order for the animal to be happy.  I was wondering if there was a similar kind of guideline for cats?  I did find it mentioned in The Cat Fancier's Association website that their minimum size of a cattery for a single, 4 pound, cat is 30 square feet.  Is there a guideline for how much space a cat needs to have if keeping them in a house/apartment? "
1750,What are the warning signs that my cat is about to bite?,My cat suddenly bit me! Was my cat giving me any warning signs that I could have looked for? What should I do when I see those warning signs next time? 
1751,Safety for Cats: fly-screen?,"I hope I am in the right place...  I am considering getting two cats, and am planning what changes by apartment would need for them. I am living on the third floor, and in summer, while home, my windows are basically open all the time. I have a flyscreen velcroed against the window to keep bugs out.  I am absolutely sure this will NOT hold a cat if it pushes against it... and the drop BEHIND it it really high. I would actually feel better about a cat if there was no flyscreen at all, because the cat would not be tempted to push or jump against something that looks kind of climbable.  Does anyone have any experience if the flyscreen on a window like that would be a problem? Or should I find another bug-protection... or can a cat-protection be added?  The windows open to the inside, awesome for cleaning, but it mean I'd have a hard time blocking it. "

1753,How can I tell if my horses need additional protection from the cold?,"It's been getting as low as 30 degrees Fahrenheit where I live and we have a few horses on the property, with no barn, but there is a roofed area for them to get under. We feed them hay and horse feed when it gets cold, and that's that.  Someone told me they keep horses in stalls when its cold, even with blankets. Do I need to do anything additional to protect my own horses from the cold? How can I tell if my horses want additional protection?  Edit: I don't know what kind of horses these are but they don't have long fur or anything "
1754,Should I get a puppy that's been separated from its mother?,"While at my village, a poor puppy was taken away without permission from his mother. I was notified of that and so went to check on the puppy and found that poor thing chained outside alone helplessly crying and terrified. After I've made sure with the owners that the puppy was not sold, I went to take the puppy back, only to find they've released him because they sensed we were onto them. I searched for him and found him in the woods shivering and whimpering from fear, even though during the morning he was such a personality.   Another bunch of dogs (probably wild)  were barking at him from a distance, and I reckoned he tried to approach them but was scared off. I slowly approached him and he was trembling from fear though I played with him in the morning and fed him. After petting him to calm him, I held him and took him to his mom.   I sensed how fast his heart was beating when I held him, and it was absolutely heart breaking to see him this way. It got me wondering, are the puppies sold in shops separated from their mothers? I would think that the only way to take them without traumatizing them is basically by being their mother and not taking them after they've developed that bond and dependency on their mom. How can I know if a puppy has been separated from his mother? And if he/she has then should I consider buying or adopting him/her?  "
1755,How do kittens prevent my cats from going into heat?,"I have two indoor cats who're sisters. One of them got pregnant and had kittens, and the sister did not go in heat once during the 3 months we had the kittens. Do kittens prevent a cat from going in to heat? If so, how? "
1756,How to comfort and older dog with vestibular disease,"Yesterday my 12+ year old mixed breed dog was diagnosed with vestibular disease.  Before going so far as to get an expensive cat scan her vet has prescribed Prednisone (steroids) and Primor (antibiotic) in the hopes that it is an inner ear infection, though he fears it may be something more sinister.   She is now behaving about as well as can be expected, as she is still eating and drinking, and still enjoys a patting and will wag her tail on my approach, however she is obviously in discomfort and disoriented, especially during the night.  As of last night she has begun to refuse to cross the tile floor in my house, which means I have to carry her to take her outside. An act that clearly disorients her even further causing her to squirm and kick.  What can I do to keep her comfortable, especially during the night beyond leaving lights on for her? Also, what is the best way to transport her outside? Covering the tile floor with rugs and towels seems to have no effect.  "

1759,(Normally very) sweet labrador becomes aggressive around other dogs,"I have a (nearly) 8 year old female Labrador, who has always been extremely sweet around humans.  In her early days, she played with the other neighbourhood dogs without a problem, but when I moved to London (UK), it became hard to socialize her, as I was in a less nice part of town where most dogs were raised to be aggressive.  Since then I moved to a much nicer part of London, but sadly most of the dogs around were cat-sized, and quite yappy, which she didn't particularly like. It was in this part of town that she got bitten by a Bull Mastiff.  Since then I've had troubles with her around other dogs. She has no interest in playing or being around them, and has started launching herself at other dogs when they get close.  I have no idea of how to fix this behaviour, and I thought i'd turn to you for some guidance.   Is there some particular training I should do with her? Change some things that will make it easier further down the line?  I'm conscious that dogs have different personalities, and I don't want to force her to be around other dogs if she doesn't like it, but at the same time, I don't want her pulling me or my girlfriend towards other dogs when we're walking her, or worse yet, launch herself at other dogs when she's off lead in the park playing with the ball.  I should note that she's never bitten anything or anyone, though she does look like she's trying when she gets aggressive towards other dogs.  I would really, really appreciate any guidance you may be able to give me in this matter.  Thanks "
1760,Are there sure signs I can see my cat might have arthritis?,"So I've been having some issues with my 16 years old cat peeing on the floor around her litter and it has been suggested that she might be having arthritis problems. Hence my question,   Are there sure signs I can see she might have arthritis? Also, is arthritis something that would normally come up in a full check-up exam at the vet? "
1761,Is it okay to let my dog run when she's scared?,"When I take my dog on walks, sometimes there will be loud noises that scare her (e.g. thunder, construction, large vehicles driving by). When this happens her flight response kicks in and she wants to take off running. She's securely on leash and won't get away, but I often will just start running with her. I usually try to jog with her anyway, and it's more often that I'm going too fast for her than the opposite, so I don't mind running for a little while when she gets scared like this.  She also likes to run, more often when she's off-leash at the dog park or the beach, so it's not something she only does when she's scared. I partially hope that by running with her when she's scared she might forget she's scared and just be happy running.  I'm wondering, is it okay to let her run when she's scared? Would it be better to not move and try to calm her down? On the one hand, I think it might be good to let her get out that energy to help calm her down some. On the other hand, I could see the argument that it encourages the fear response and might make her more likely to run away at loud noises in the future. I'm not worried about owner/pet dominance and her being in control of the pace - we only go as fast as I want, and I don't always let her run when she wants. "
1762,Why are my old cat's pupils always dilated?,"My cat is probably around 25 years old.  She still has decent vision, hearing, jumps up onto my chair, no apparent arthritis or any other health issues. The vet said she's fine.  The only odd thing is here eyes are always dilated.  My apartment tends to be dark, but even if I take her outside during the day, her pupils do not make the familiar cat-slit shapes but stay wide open round.  She still seems to see well enough to not bump into walls or plants, but I imagine her view of the world is like an overexposed photograph.  She'e mostly indoors anyway.    The vet said this sometimes happens for older cats. I am curious to know more.  Why is this?  Is there a treatment, and if so how helpful would it be for this almost indoors-only cat? "
1763,I'm moving and have stray not ferral cat I don't want to leave behind. Won't come inside at all,"This question is different then one posted because this stray won't come inside the house nor will he even go inside the cat shelter I built for him.  I've been caring for outside cat for about year now. Took several months for him to trust me he still doesn't completely trust my boyfriend.  He comes around when I call or is outside waiting on me every morning. He loves to be pet, but I have four inside cats and he also has no interest in coming inside.  I've tried getting him on back patio in rain and he won't come. I'm moving out of state and I don't want leave him. He has become dependant upon me. What can I do? Can he be safely re located with me? I love the little guy so much. "
1764,Snapping fingers in place of a clicker,"I don't own any pet but I was considering getting a dog pretty soon. (A Basset Hound to be exact, gosh these guys are cute.)  I'd like to teach my future companion a lot of things, from the basic ""Come here"" to the more advanced ""Roll over"".  Clicker training seemed promising as a way to teach those activities but having to carry a tool each time I want to play with him or teach him things seems unnecessarily troublesome.  As I've understood it, the main idea of clicker training is to have a distinct sound be played as a way to say ""Good"" to your dog. If that is the case, couldn't we replace the ""clicker"" by a good old fingersnap ?   Has anyone had any experience with such alternatives ?  Unrelated question : Is the basset hound a good first dog ?  Thanks in advance "
1765,How can I free feed a cat without feeding the ants?,"In the question Can I feed my cat whenever she wants? the OP feeds dry cat food, but is not able to leave the food out all the time as ants are an issue.  Is it possible to place dry cat food so the cat can get it but the ants can't?  "
1766,What is the minimum space to keep a cat in an outdoor enclosure?,"I was wondering what the minimum space requirement is for keeping a cat? I was thinking of rescuing another cat and keeping it in my bedroom because my dad is allergic to cats but it still would be to much for my dads allergies, then I thought that maybe I could keep an outdoor cat. I already have two outdoor cats that are part feral and don't like other cats coming into our yard, they will chase away and attack the new cat. I was thinking I could keep a cat in a big contained space outside that separate my outdoor cats I have now. The only problem is I don't know what size is the minimum, do you know the smallest space that a cat can live in?  "
1767,Accidentally scared dog last night and he has been aggressive/scared of me since,"So my girlfriend and I adopted a rescue dog like 4-5 months ago, we don't know the breed for sure, but we think he is a Treeing Walker Coonhound based on his looks, and the vet thinks he's like 5-7 years old...she said he looked like he had a rough go at it as he was malnourished, a bit mangy, and has a couple small scars/bald spots, but he has been sweet as can be since we've had him.  We play together a lot, rough house, I made weird sounds at him, and he always loves it.  Last night, we were playing and I was scratching his belly, and then I did a little raspberry type thing (like when you vibrate your lips on a baby's stomach or something like that, I hadn't heard that term before my girlfriend said it), but didn't blow hard or anything, just made a weird sound and vibrated my lips.  He aggressively snapped at me when I did that, and I backed away.  When I re-approached, he started growling very aggressively.  The hair on his back was standing straight-up, and he was just petrified of me after that - hair was straight up and he was shaking for hours.  He is fine with my girlfriend, but so uncomfortable with me.  He has taken treats out of my hand, but goes back to being very aggressive and growling after that just towards me.  My girlfriend and I walked him this morning, and if I was ahead of him, he wouldn't follow me.  I've been trying to act normal today, and to kind of ignore him - not in a mean way, just a ""going about my day"" type of thing, and not petting him or getting super close.  He still is just eyeing me with this piercing suspicion.  Anyone have any suggestions/thoughts?  He has always slept in our bed, and did so last night, but stayed on my girlfriend's side, and I had a pillow between me and him so I wouldn't accidentally jostle him with my foot or anything.  Any thoughts?  Was considering going to a behavior specialist or something like that?  But I'd be curious if anyone has some thoughts or has gone through a similar experience with a dog.  Will he hate me forever?  He does seem a bit better today - i.e., hair isn't standing up and I'm in the same room as him without getting growls, but he still does NOT enjoy my presence. "
1768,Are commercial cat foods addictive?,"I have been feeding my cat (3 years old neutered male British shorthair) with dry and occasionally wet (but I prefer mostly dry food according to the vet's advice to keep his teeth healthy) food from one of the most expensive cat food brand since he was 2 months old.  I feel that to eat the same food all the time might not be healthy and try to give him some fresh cooked meal. What surprises me is that he shows almost no interest in trying fresh cooked food, chicken, beef or fish which a normal stray cat would love to have. He just smells the food I offer him and look at my face like “Are you kidding me? Do you really think that I eat this crap?”. I have also tried cooking meat without any salt and spices but still didn’t work with him.   According to some websites, fabricated foods “are sprayed with proprietary mixtures of palatability enhancers”. I have no problem with that as long as they are not unhealthy. However, I really wonder if commercial foods have all the nutrition and vitamins my cat needs.   Now the questions:   How can I change my cat's eating habit that he eats also fresh cooked meats? According to some cat owners, cat will eat anything if you don’t feed him a day (or two) long but I can’t do that. Or is it completely ok if cat eats fabricated food all the time?  "
1769,Why shouldn't I use Lemon Dawn to wash a cat?,"There is an answer on Biology.SE, indicating that lemon dawn can help control fleas but also should not be used on cats. What ""adverse reactions"" do Limonene and Linalool have on cats?  How is this different from reactions on other species?  "
1770,How can I make sure wild baby bunnies aren't orphaned?,"A few weeks ago I saw a wild rabbit eating my green beans. I kept seeing her but she sort of stopped. Sort of. Last night, while it was still light, my dog had something in his mouth, I yelled at him to drop it because 2 years ago on easter had a baby bunny. Anyways he dropped it and it was a newborn baby bunny. I put on gloves and put it in an open plastic container, putting the fluff surrounding the nest in it, and what do i find? 7 more newborn bunnies. when I say newborn I mean they were born at the very least on Friday or Saturday, if not yesterday. The nest was in my yard, which is fenced, and with my dog being an avid hunter I decided I would dig them another little nest nearby. Just as I was picking up the container, the mom was a few feet away and darted under the fence. I dug them a little burrow on the other side of my fence so my mean dog wouldn't kill them. I would say a few yards away. The entire time the mom was watching me, I put them in the nest, I checked on them this morning and they were all still in there and burrowed together (so adorable) but I was wandering a few things.  -Is there a way to tell if they are orphaned? -Is there a way to tell if they are unhealthy? -What do i do if they are orphaned or unhealthy?  (I can post a picture if needed, but they look healthy and made little cut noises too) "
1771,My rabbit just died but she leaves behind a bonded sister of 7 years. How can I help her cope?,"My rabbit just died but she leaves behind a bonded sister of 7 years. The rabbit who died has always been interested and friendly with us but her sister has always been very tentative and shy with people. I understand that it is recommended to bring the rabbit's dead body home from the vet to let the other rabbit get closure, but unfortunately this is not an option.  How can I help my rabbit cope with the passing of her sister and recognize symptoms of depression? I feel like showering her with attention is not something she will necessarily enjoy. I could give her extra treats, but that doesn't seems like a great idea either. Should I make changes to her environment perhaps? She has free run of the house currently. Getting a new rabbit to bond with is not an option.  I know this is not an easy question, so thank you deeply for any suggestions. "
1772,catnip in cat food,"We recently won a big batch of cat food in a raffle, it was an unknown brand to us (Feringa).  We checked the contents and the bag of cat grains says it contains 0.5% catnip. After reading this question its clear that cats shouldn't eat catnip as a treat.  But how bad would 0.5% be?  I gave some to my mother who gave it to her cats and she said they absolutely loved it, this was before we knew it had catnip in it. So after that we figured out why the cats absolutely loved it.  I don't want to end up with 2 cats who only want this brand of food anymore because it contains catnip and don't want to have to feed them this for the rest of their lives like they are addicts. Would it be okay to give my cats this food or should i just dump it to be safe? "
1773,Should I worry that my milksnake likes to hang out behind the rock facade?,"My milksnake likes to find a way behind the foam rock wall and hang out against the glass. I try to move her and set the wall more securely, but she always finds a way back there again. Anything to worry about? Is my tank too warm for her? Or does she just find this area cozy / safe. The terrarium is 3' x 2', and she's grown to about 5 ft.   "
1774,Cats holding grudges?,"Cats evidently have a decent memory, as they can be taught tricks (though not easily). Furthermore, they are able to learn where their house is, and retrace their steps when wandering outside the house. I was washing my cat (to my cat's obvious outrage), and was wondering how long it would hold a grudge. Assuming cats can hold a grudge, and would form one after one such outrage, how long would they hold that grudge? How long would they remember the incident? "
1775,How long before my redeared slider she lays eggs? Should I force her onto land?,"I have 4 adult redeared sliders, two male and two female.  One of my females is definately carrying eggs.    They are in a wonderful outdoor habitat. We did all the research before we built it two years ago.  The reason we moved them from the tank they were in that was inside the house is because the female layed eggs in the water and they had gotten to big.    Last summer when we moved them outside they hardly ever even basked on the ramp and never left the pond and walked around on land.  This year they bask on the ramp but still have never seen them on land.    I know that the female has had eggs for atleast 3 weeks now and am wondering if I should make her spend time on land in the enclosed habitat by fencing off an area inside the habitat to put her in so she will lay the eggs or will she eventually crawl out and nest on her own?    The mixture of soil to sand is exactly what it is suppose to be and is at least 13"" deep throughout the habitat.  I used a rake and smoothed out the soil in the habitat so I will be able to tell if the turtles are getting out of the pond and walking around and am absolutely sure they havent so I know there isnt a nest that I'm just missing. I am also wondering if she does nest and the eggs hatch will the babies dig to the surface on their own or do I need to make sure I know where she nests so I can help? "

1777,problems when a cat eats cucumber leaves?,"In my head this question is kinda awkward.  this year we started planting some vegetables on the balcony. (for your information it's strawberries, tomato, cucumber, bell pepper, hot pepper, lemon balm, mint)  So our cat is usually pleased when he gets some herbs (afaik helps digestion) and usually he tries to get the balm. Recently he discovered the big leaves of our cucumbers and since then he is acting kinda odd.  Whenever we are near the balcony door, he would start complaining and showing that he wants to go there. When we give in, he goes straight for the cucumber leaves and we don't know why he behaves this way.  What could this behaviour of his mean? Is there anything in that plant that might help or harm him?  Cheers "
1778,Is it safe to leave a Sheltie puppy with access to a doggy door?,"I have to go to work during the day and I'm struggling to find a system that works well for making my Sheltie comfortable when I'm gone. I leave her in the house with plenty of food and water, check on her during my lunch break if I can, etc, but potty training is NOT going well.   So, what I'd like to do is install a doggy door this weekend. That way she'd have a lot more space to play in and it would make it infinitely easier to potty train her. Asides from the fact that I find training pads to be gross, she doesn't get what they're for anyway, despite my many attempts to follow tutorials on training her.  She likes to go outside (""go"" in both senses of the word). So that's great.  But there's 1 problem. While my yard is fully fenced, at 3 months she's still skinny enough to squeeze between the gaps in my fence when she wants to. This is kind of what the fence looks like (more or less):    My plan is to add a 2nd level of fencing, probably using the thick plastic net with metal stakes you see here:    However, I'm fearful that she'll be able to dig under or bite through it. Is that a valid concern with this kind of puppy?  If she can chew through it, suppose I put in metal chicken wire. Would that do the trick or would she dig under it? I've never seen her digging but I used to have a husky so I know that some dogs would dig under it in seconds. "
1779,Will fleas get back in my home if I wash them down the drain?,"I have researched drowning fleas.  There is a lot of good data at Can dish soap really be used to kill ticks and fleas? the summary there suggests if you wash fleas away in the yard, your pet well get them back tomorrow. But if you wash them down the drain they are gone forever.      There are multiple online reports of ""drowning fleas"" and killing them with soapy water.  After looking for the science there does not seem to be much support for these fatal claims. There is little doubt that giving your pet a soapy bath in the tub will help remove the fleas, they may even appear dead.  But in all likelihood these fleas are just waiting to dry out and be revived, hopefully in the city sewer.  If you bath your pet in the yard, and than let the dry pet in the yard again the next day the clean pet and clean revived fleas will likely reunite. Soapy water is more likely to facilitate removal of the comatose flea from the pet and carry it down the drain. So it is reasonable to have noticeable decrease in the flea population after a bath.  But excessive bathing has it's own risks and given the life cycle of a flea soapy baths alone are unlikely to be a final solution.   I believe some insects, like spiders if flushed or washed down the drain will often climb back up into the home.    Does the same hold true for fleas? Does flushed = ""Gone"" or ""On a short trip, be right back""?  "
1780,"My cat drinks out of our swimming pool, is this a problem?","My cat Rosie (female, age 8) likes to drink out of our swimming pool.  This has apparently been going on for a while, but I just found out yesterday.  Given the following:   She prefers to drink water from a specific area of the pool, one that happens to not be near the filter or the water jets. There is no ladder or stepwell in the pool (we just climb out from the shallow end).   There is a mount for a ladder, but it's not near where Rosie drinks water.  The pool liner is brand-new and the water is clean. I don't know what we use to treat the water (but I can find out). Rosie is perfectly healthy.   I have these questions:   Will the pool water give our cat any health problems? If Rosie falls in, will she be able to get out? If she falls in, can she damage our pool liner?  "

1783,What are the benefits and drawbacks of using Zeuterin or a product like it for neutering a dog?,What are the benefits and drawbacks of using Zeuterin or a product like it for neutering a dog? Zeutrin is a product that chemically castrates a male dog via an injection directly to the center of the testes by a vet. It avoids surgery and leaves some hormone production in place.   I have talked to several people that are interested in it and I hear that it has been used outside of the US for some time. Does anyone have experience with it? Are there any good places to read about it that are not just from the company producing it? Are there any similar products out there? 
1784,Should you teach different cues to help a dog know to go wider during an away and go-by inside flank?,Should you teach different cues to help a dog know to go wider during an away and go-by inside flank? Obviously we know we need different cues for the away and go-by flanks and those cues are also used for the inside flank. But what about a cue to indicate a wider go-by vs. away inside flank?  I know that some of the top trainers out there have different cues for each and I'm wondering why the difference is needed and if it has to do with just the inside flank or if you should have different cues for going wider on a normal flank as well. 
1785,"I train 2-on/2-off contacts, what exercises I can use to help keep them consistent?","I train a stopped 2-on/2-off contact what exercises I can use to help keep them consistent?  By consistent I mean they should be within the criteria is the below. I think that other types of contact behavior should be a different question because the different styles are SO different and each deserve their own focused question.   A reliability rate of about 80%... I don't want more than this because I think it makes the rules to stiff and doesn't encourage a guessing/edgy dog. I don't want less than that because when we are in the exciting trial environment I want them to hold up. Smooth stride up the up side. I don't want them to hit the A-frame hard on the way up because I think that causes to much stress on their shoulders, front legs, and feet over time and certainly doesn't help the speed of the rest of the a-frame. Speed over the top Striding nicely on the down side. I don't want a stutter step because it eats up time and also seems hard on their shoulders over time Striding deep into the down-side yellow. I don't want a jump to the bottom because if they miss the bottom and the yellow altogether it is a fault. And jumping from that height can be hard on their front end over time. A stop at the bottom with both front feet pretty far into the dirt and both back feet on the obstacle. I want the front feet far into the dirt on average so that the range in the performance doesn't ever include the dog stopped with either front foot still on the obstacle. I think this helps make the desired position clear. An instant release on cue.   I know others also include some of the below... if you have more ideas on criteria to add please do:   having a specific foot forward so that the weight shift on take off is most efficient but I'm not that technical yet. :-) having the dog sit at the bottom instead of standing. I think they do this so that they are loaded to ""spring"" off... or maybe it is just to help encourage the weight on the back end to reduce wear on the shoulders?   (Should this be a community wiki?) "

However, until a few days ago, all behavior changes were traditional territorial cues.  Two days ago, my female rabbit (who seems bonded to me slightly more than her bond mate) started acting very quirky.  Rather than hanging and following me around, she seemed to actively try to avoid me aside from a few  minutes per day.  At one point I came into the room she was in, sat down, and said her name, which caused her to get up from her flopped out position and move to the room on the opposite side of the house!  ... I just figured she was feeling poorly.  However, when she started chasing her bond mate, I decided to hold her for a bit to distract her, and she immediately started purring (not out of the question, but usually I have to have her in my arms for at least 20 seconds). She's currently moulting, so I also began to pluck her.  After about 5 minutes I hit a sore spot and she started to strugle like she would like to be put back down. However, once I got a better grip on her she'd continue to purr, even while I only plucked instead of petting.  She also seemed to be actively looking for mischief: chewing on things she normally has no interest in; taking large chunks of paint off the book shelf and trying to eat them; eating the strips off the sides of my shoes; etc.  I gave her a Timothy cube and the destructive behavior stopped.  However as I'm writing this she's trying to climb out of the condo into the storage area next to it, and this reminds me that she's been climbing the furniture all day (waiting for me on the arm of the couch closest to the door while I was out).  About a week ago she started becoming more aggressive about making it to the right food bowl first (we have 3 scattered throughout the house to keep them guessing), and somehow is able to get to the top of a 4 floor condo that I built for them faster than I can dispense them (making it very difficult to place kibble in the bowl).  However, as of 32 hrs ago, both rabbits have been extremely kibble focused, and the female is now standing on top of the food bowl and prairie dogging over the top of the condo.  Even stranger, and what spurred me to post was that 10 minutes ago she tried to leap over the top floor barrier at the small cup of kibble I was carrying.   Fortunately, she got her back legs hooked in the barrier and fell back to the top floor.  Could any of the following really be just a bonding thing?   Reckless climbing and begging? Disturbed by my presence? Very happy when picked up? Chewing on unusual things?   Is my rabbit suffering from brain damage?  (she had lead poisoning 2 years ago) "
1789,Dogs in vehicles - which is safer; harness or crate?,"When traveling with a dog in the car, which is safer:  a dog harness made for use with seatbelts?  or a crate?  My puppy is around 14 lbs, and we've been using a crate for travel. I'm inclined to think this is safer, as it keeps the dog in an enclosed space.  Thoughts? "
1790,If you want both a stopped and a running contact how do you train it?,"If you want both a stopped and a running contact how do you train it? I have trained a stopped contact before and I have a dog who is small and training a running contact was not an issue because she doesn't jump over the yellow. But what if you want the choice to use both with the same dog? Also, what if I want a running A-frame but always a stopped dog-walk? Any special issues I'd run into there?  Here is a great example of a dog with both a stopped and running contact. "
1791,How do you start training a dog for treibball?,I have figured out training my dog to hit the ball with the nose and a closed mouth but I'm not sure on the next step to take. Do I start with multiple balls now or should I teach getting the ball in the goal first? Or maybe training to go around and hit the ball from the other side first? 
1792,Can an 11 year old dog be castrated?,"Five and a half months ago I took home from a dog refuge a cross-bred Britanny Spaniel to be company for our Border Collie (who at the time was 7 months old). So today the Border is one year old and the Britanny (Jake) is eleven.  Generally, they get on well, and if the young border wants to play too much (he loves chewing the other's ear) the older dog bears his teeth and snarls, and will even chase the younger around the garden to get him stop.  At the beginning, Jake was very quiet and calm, but has opened up and now dashes to me when I get home from work, and will follow me around the garden and all around the house - my wife says that he now lives only for me! Just recently though, he has started to dry hump the Border, and now follows him about like a love-sick suitor! What is strange is that the Border was castrated five months ago.  I know that dry humping can be a sign of  dominance, but between the two it has always been the Border who is dominant - for example, if the Border has finished eating and Jake hasn't, the Border just pushes him away and finishes the bowl (in practise either I am there to stop this or one eats outside and the other inside).  So, finally, my question is should I have him castrated or is he too old? What alternative solutions are there? At the moment, when he does it we say ""No"" and he usually stops, otherwise we push him away and repeat ""No"" until he stops (usually for about 10 minutes max!). "
1793,"In herding, what is meant by a ""flank"" and what are the different types?","In herding, what is meant by a ""flank"" and what are the different types? It is easy to see that there are a couple of different types of flanks, one going clock-wise and one going counter clock-wise but I've also heard of ""clean"" flanks and ""inside"" flanks. Is there a good description of each of these and what they mean? "
1794,"In dog agility, what is a stopped contact and what is a running contact?","In dog agility, what is a stopped contact and what is a running contact? Are there other types of contacts as well? Are the rules always the same no matter what venue you are competing in? "
1795,"What are ""growth plates"" in dogs?","I've heard a lot of people say you should wait until a dogs ""growth plates"" are closed before fixing them. What does that mean? From what I understand it isn't really a bone structure called a growth plate but more of an area at the end of the bone that has to do with the length or speed that the bone grows... is that right? I'd like to know what it is actually referring to.   I was listening to a TED talk that was talking about the layer of stem cells over a bone that causes bones to heal and it makes me wonder if that is related. "
1796,Training a dog walking handstands,"There are many cool tricks but I really like the walking handstand, so I started investigating how to efficiently train this to my dog.  A watched this clicker-training video (Youtube, ""Train your dog the walking handstand!""). It mentions progressing slowly: the dog puts his hind paws on something progressively higher (e.g. one or more books). That makes sense to me and the dog needs time to get his balance right and to have enough strength on the muscles he need.  So my idea was to start as early as possible (my puppy is 5 months old), that would be a fun exercise for him.  However the video advices not to train that to puppies or before the dog is well over a year old.  Is this a good advice and could this be detrimental to the growth of the dog ? "
1797,Dog with Congestive Heart Failure - Rapid Heart Beat,"My dog was diagnosed with congestive heart failure roughly 8 months ago. Though her breathing has been the thing we have noticed and discussed primarily with the vets, that seems to be under control with her current medication.  Her heart rate, however, has become concerning.  Her heart rate is rapid even when resting, and very pronounced when you feel her chest. It also seems quite irregular, I tried to measure her beats per minute but I couldn't tell, and my wife and I had wildly different estimates.   Is this normal with congestive heart failure?  My main concern is that she not suffer. Could she be suffering with a rapid, seemingly irregular heart beat?    Other notes:   She is slowing down significantly on walks (likely compounded by summer heat). She's overall less active. She is becoming a more finicky eater, though still eating as we are putting things like chicken / fish in her dinner now. She hasn't lost all her spunk, there are moments where she shows some playfulness, and still some moments where she'll be a guard dog, but it is definitely reduced. She saw a vet &amp; cardiologist 2 months ago, they told us to come back in 6 months.  While I understand I'll get the best information by bringing her back, it's both expensive and traumatic for her!  So I really do appreciate any advice that can be offered.  "
1798,Neon tetra left fin looks snapped and white,Hi I have 6 neon tetras in a 29-gallon tank. I noticed one of them has the left fin looking like snapped to the side and white.

1799,Kitten fast breathing while sleeping,"My 3 month old kitten is breathing quite fast while sleeping after a round of running around and playing. Currently the house is about 28.5 degrees Celsius, so its quite hot.  She also breathes with her mouth open but only after she runs for 15 mins straight.   She eats regularly and sleeps well, drinks water normally and is very very active.   Should I be concerned? What do you guys think, is it normal given the warm weather and physical activity?  Here is an example: [website]"

1801,Senior Cat limping on hind leg (putting weight on it) sudden onset 3 days ago - see vet or wait? Possible causes? No signs of abnormality,"This question is about a senior-age cat (10-11, not sure of exact age as she was a stray) with no relevant medical history. She had a ""fall from height"" ~3 years ago with fractured (?) roof of mouth but has been fine since receiving treatment then.  She does seem to be thinner these days despite eating enough, but this has been going on for a while.  3 days ago she was fine when we came home from work. We went out again to do other stuff and when we came back in the evening, noticed that she was limping on the right back leg.  She is putting weight on it (not holding it up off the ground) on every step, it isn't ""floppy"". We have examined the paw, claws, pads etc and found nothing - there isn't anything inflamed, sores, bites, abscesses, lumps or anything like that either. She is still climbing stairs (a bit more awkwardly than usual though) etc.  From what I can tell she isn't in particular pain with it from any of the ""poking"" I tried (paw pads etc), she didn't pull the leg away or anything like that. But it must be painful to put full weight on it since she isn't doing that...  She is eating, toileting, interacting with our other cats normally.  I'm sure it is something physical rather than e.g. acting out ""behaviourally"".  It seems to come and go a bit in that sometimes she is limping more than others so I think it's ""better"" and then later she is limping a bit more etc.  My questions: - would you advise taking her to the vet at this point or wait a bit longer and see if it resolves? - what are possible causes of this given that we've ruled out the usual ""injury to paw pads"" etc. ?    Update:   I waited another day and then made an appointment at the vet for the next day, so about 5 days total since the limping started. During this time it didn't change in any way and her habits (eating, toileting, amount of activity etc) were still normal.  The vet did a physical exam (but no x ray at this point) and didn't find anything so it could be arthritis or just ""pulled something"" etc.  We now have a Metacam anti-inflammatory to give her daily and instructions to go back after this is finished if it still continues (at which point they will probably do x rays etc)  The vet also recommended some blood tests to check for various conditions, which I'm pleased to say have come back normal!

1802,How to introduce new cats with my only cat?,"I live in a 2 bedroom apartment with a roommate. I have a male cat (who I'm about to get fixed soon). He's been the only animal around since I got him, and it's about a year old. He's starting to show signs of, well, mating. I'm on a second floor apartment, and I've never let him outside. Although he was originally found outside as a kitten.  Meanwhile, I have a girlfriend who's considering moving in with me. She has 2 cats, male and female, both fixed. She plans on bringing these cats with her.  My cat Butters is free to roam anywhere he wants, and his litter box is in the laundry room, and food/water is in the kitchen. And he sleeps in my bedroom. I keep all the doors open for him, except for my roommate's bedroom.  See where I'm getting at?  The only way I see this possible is to keep Butters constrained to my bedroom, move the litter box, food, and water into there, and let the 2 new cats roam the rest of the apartment. Since Butters spends most of his time in my bedroom anyway.  But then what? How should I introduce them without a fight?  Months ago, a friend brought their female cat over to visit. He didn't like her at all, and hissed and groaned and almost started a big fight. He's territorial.   The 2 new cats get along together great, and come from a place with other cats. They're used to the outdoors, too.  So that's 2 domestically-born fixed male/female cats used to other cats and the outdoors, being introduced to my un-fixed cat which was originally born in the wild but then domesticated and kept indoors.   I feel Butters needs these 2 cats to keep him company and to learn from. But I'm afraid he'll become hostile, since he doesn't know how to be around other cats.   How should I approach this?  "

1804,How can I provide intellectual stimulation to my cat other than through food?,"My indoor cat has a (rotating) variety of toys, things to climb on and scratch, and places to run around; I'm not concerned about him getting enough physical stimulation.  But I've heard that cats also need mental stimulation.  How do I best provide that, both when I'm playing with him and when he's alone in the house?  I know that there are ""puzzle toys"" that reward solving the puzzle by dispensing kibble or treats, but I'd rather not have that happening all over the house (especially where any missed kibbles could be ground into rugs).  What other options do I have for exercising his mind as well as his body?  The cat is probably 12 or 13 years old.  Getting another cat isn't an option right now because of disease-transmission concerns.  Other than being a carrier for something I'd rather not spread (coronavirus), my cat is healthy. "

1806,"3 mo. old dachshund puppy is quiet in crate for an hour, then starts barking","Our 3 mo. old dachshund puppy has gotten pretty good at being in his crate for about an hour to an hour and a half during the day. We've never had any trouble at night. He'll sleep 8+ hours and doesn't whine in the morning, he just waits until we let him out. During the day I've recorded him many times while away to see how he gets on. He'll sometimes whine/bark within the first 5-10 minutes of me putting him in the kennel and leaving, but then he quiets down for at least an hour. Then he'll start whining and barking, and will continue until let out(as long as 40 minutes of barking based on my recordings). I know I've accidentally rewarded it before by thinking he was being quiet when I came home, and then realizing from hearing the recording that he was barking/whining until he heard me coming.  It's frustrating because he's so good for up to an hour and a half. I suspect he sleeps for that first hour to an hour and a half, and then starts barking and whining when he wakes up. What should I do? If I can approach quietly and hear him barking should I wait it out even if he goes on for at least an hour? I don't know yet how long before he'll stop again, or if he even will.  Thanks, Ryan  "
1807,Active wildlife outside the window- Good or Bad for Cat psychology?,"At my current house, there is an active community of wild creatures in the backyard, including a variety of birds, chipmunks and squirrels, rabbits, a groundhog, and butterflies by day and lightning bugs by night.  My little 2yo tortie female DSH has two towers near windows, and two glass sliding doors to look out of and observe this community going about its business in all weather, all seasons, and all times of day.  A clear benefit of this is entertainment, something to see and do that isn't lying on the floor being bored.  There's also an exercise element as she runs from one vantage point to the next to follow a rabbit across the yard, for example.  But a potential down side is the frustration of the solid glass barrier.  I have seen her clearly attempting to get to a bird or a chipmunk by pawing at the edges, trying to climb onto the window border, and things like that.  Her hunting instinct has kicked in, but is being thwarted.  So in the balance, is this situation good or bad for the cat's overall mental and emotional well-being?  In other words, do the benefits outweigh the risks?  As a follow-up, if the conclusion is negative, what can I do about it?  Note that closing curtains is not viable, as that would first of all be bad for my emotional well-being (making my house feel like a dark dungeon) but also, the cat can simply slide behind the curtain.  This cat does have a handful of toys, and does play with them both independently and interactively with me. "
1808,Dog rolls in poop at daycare,"We have a 1 year old BernieDoodle that is pretty well behaved at the house. We take him to Doggy Daycare once or twice a week so he can get some energy out and mingle since we work.  At daycare he has lately been rolling in his (or others, not sure) poop. It's about every other time. Someone mentioned he might be trying to eat it so try changing food. The odd thing is this only happens there. When we leave him at the house alone he is fine. He is a very social and happy dog at home and there so not sure what this means.  Any thoughts? Are we taking him too much maybe? Food? "

1810,my cat loves my bed - why?,"Is it the springiness of the mattress?  I am getting a new bed (for me) and thought that I could use my old bed for my cat. But this means paying somebody to saw the mattress into a size that fits my bedroom. Will this be worth it? Will my cat like it?   I hate to wake her up from my bed, but she leaves once I sit on the bed, she knows I will soon be in it, and take up too much space for her liking, and so she leaves. But she does love the bed lately, in spite of her several other cosy sleeping spots.  "
1811,Should I give my pets vitamins or other supplements?,"I want my cat to live long and I'm thinking of giving her human vitamins and supplements.  Sadly, all cat foods like Meow Mix and Fancy Feast don't have vitamins added, and considering that in nature processed foods don't exist and animals get a lot of sunlight, I think that most human pets are vitamin deprived unknowing to their owner, even if they appear healthy.  I think I should like give my pets fish oil (like those omega 6 acids that are fat) and vitamins to help them have them live long and healthy lives.  I want to know if its safe to give these vitamins:   Vitamin D and here's why: guess where Vitamin D is found in nature?  In meat?  Nope... actually it is found in fish, and also (you can google it if you don't believe me), sunlight exposure.  People who are indoors are usually deprived of vitamin d.  And what do cats eat in nature: vitamins and sunlight... they don't sit indoors all day long eating vitamin deprived processed meat Fish oil, and according to google it is called ""Omega-6 Fatty Acids"", and in the wild cats get lots of fish oil, since wild cats eat fish and that's their favorite food. Vitamin B6, my cat was smart but I believe that giving her vitamins that are neuroprotective is very good for her and can make her EVEN SMARTER. 5-htp my cat isn't aggressive but just so she was less stressed...    My cat was always healthy but I believe that if i give vitamins and fish oil and drugs like 5-htp it will live to be like 40 years old... because if a human child only survived on processed meat all their lives starting from being a kid... do u think they wood die at age 8 or at age 80? i think at age 8. and not to mention that processed cat food is probably much worse then chicken McNuggets since i think they would be investing less in animal safety then into human safety.  Sadly they don't sell vitamins and supplements for pets, so I'm considering products sold for humans.  tl;dr:  I want to know if it is safe to give 5-htp, fish oil, Vitamin B6, and Vitamin D. "

1814,"Local cat attacks my dog whilst walking, what should I do?","A local cat has attacked my dog 4 times now. The attacks are unprovoked (my dog doesn't growl or bark or bother them at all) and my dog loves cats.  One of the attacks had the cat chasing me down the street with my dog in my arms (he's a large Staffordshire bull terrier so not the easiest to carry as I am a small built female) and was only resolved when a kind man trapped the cat under a car with a broom so I could escape. He informed me that the cat has attacked many passing dogs. It's a funny enough story but it's become more problematic as the cat is wandering further and my dog was attacked again outside my own house today. It's not as if I can avoid the cat's ""Territory"".  I've tried multiple things from stomping my feet near the cat in an attempt to scare it, shouting and hissing at it but nothing works. It has attacked my boyfriend's shoe when he tried to hold it back with his foot and the only way I can keep my dog safe from the cat scratching it is by picking him up out of the cat's reach but it follows me waiting for me to put him back down and it will attack again.   I am a huge animal lover and I  really don't want to hurt the cat but if it came down to it I would protect my dog even if it meant kicking the cat.   After today's attack once my dog was safely inside, I went back out to find the cat as I'd like to confront the owner however the cat wasn't wearing a collar this time. During the previous attacks it was wearing a collar so I am quite sure it isn't feral. It's frustrating that people don't view cats attacking dogs as they do the other way around...   What can I do in this situation? How can I prevent the attacks? "
1815,How to move an axolotl and his tank without needing to re-cycle?,"I'm moving my adult axolotl this weekend, and I was wondering what method was best for this. I've read that transferring him into a tupperware filled with tank water can work. Would this be ok for a 1 hour journey?   With regards to the tank, if I remove most of the water so that it's liftable, will I then need to recycle the tank once moved? Or can I simply add de-chlorinated water back then put my axolotl back in? I was planning to just leave enough water in the tank to keep the filter and decorations submerged, to maintain the bacterial culture. "
1816,Is it safe to kiss my cat on lips?,"I have an indoor cat. She is never allowed outside. She has been given every possible vaccination. She gets regular bath with cat soap. And she gets to eat only hygienic cat food.  So is it safe to kiss her on lips. Is there any chance of spread of disease?  NOTE: I have seen such things in youtube. That's why I am wondering.    In the site [website]It is given,   As such, at any point in time, a cat's mouth may be no dirtier than ours. However, cats contain certain other bacteria in their mouths, which cause gum disease. As predators, they also eat animals and insects that may harbor diseases. To be safe, avoid kissing your cat on the lips.   My cat is predator in no sense, as she is indoor and I have never seen her eating insects.  There is another question which is somewhat like this. Is it safe to hug and kiss indoor cats?  But there the specific word of not kissing on the lip is written.  And my question is exclusively about kissing on the lip.  The two are clearly not duplicate. "
1817,Dog in water - behavior with others,My dog - 1/2 English mastiff who swims - swims out to other dogs fetching their balls in the water (she already has a ball in her mouth) and puts her head on other dogs (back of the neck).

She has never ever hurt anyone but some owners and some dogs don't like it and I am quite literally on the beach and cannot get to her? 
1818,Ear infection remedies,"I just adopted a 3 year old pitbull. We took it to the vet and they said it has an ear infection, but I assume the ear infection is probably deeper in the ear as I cannot see it in the visible areas. Moreover, the dog doesn't seem to be in pain nor does he scratch his ear. So I'm not sure if this ear infection is that severe. But the vet still suggested an ear infection treatment and the bill comes to about 150$. So I'm hoping to treat it myself.   I bought hy-otic ear rinse and am planning to give its ear a good cleaning, based on some tutorials by vets on Youtube. But after that, what's the best way to go about doing something regarding antibiotics/medication, etc? Is there any good remedies?  Note: The previous owner had cut its ears short when it was a puppy apparently. For the last year or so, before he came to the pound, he's been a stray - hence the ear wax build up. "

1820,Fence aggression - guard dog or poorly trained dog?,"I am puzzled by the behavior of certain dogs, each of them living in a yard or a garden across a fence from a somewhat busy road with frequent pedestrian/runner/cycling etc. traffic (for example, a marked hiking trail).  Once a human appears on the road, which is no rare occurrence there, the dog starts running the full length of the fence back and forth or closely following the passer by, constantly barking at the ""intruder"", showing his teeth, often bumping into the fence.  The whole scenario looks like it can hardly be very healthy/enjoyable for the passer by or for the dog.  I wonder what the owner typically thinks; I don't know any of them personally.  If this is meant to be ""watching"", then it feels to me like a house alarm that goes off fifty times a day.  I'm torn about what to think about these situations.  Some resources indicate that this is desired, specifically trained behavior that is employed for protection of the property.  Other resources discuss barrier aggression as territorial behavior automatic to dogs, and yet others (usually discussing a scenario with another dog, not a human, on the other side of the fence), are discussing it more as a bad habit to be untrained.  Of course it's quite possible that each of such dogs on my map falls into a different category but I can't tell the difference.  My question is: How much of such dog behavior is under control of its owner/trainer, how much is determined by its breed and the environment?  Would a carefully trained ""watch dog"" (trained to watch the property, not the road) do more of this, or less of this?  I'm not asking about unrestrained dogs attacking people in public places, and I am also not asking about a normally calm dog in a one off situation caught by surprise.  I am not asking this question about my own pet; I don't have a dog although I'm on first name terms with several dogs. "

1823,How to make dog listen around wild animals,"My Belgian shepherd listens very well. She pays attention to me and she will come when I call her, without hesitation. She will walk right next to me without a leash. I could go on, but to summarise: she's a very good dog and we've both worked hard to get there.  However, when she spots sheep, cows, horses, pheasants, wild cats (cats she knows are fine), you name it, she totally changes. All she can focus on is the wild animal. If she's on the leash, she will just keep pulling like a 'mad dog' in that direction. Any kind of correction is totally ignored. It's tunnel vision and I am like air to her. Whatever I may do, pull on leash, 'shout', try to get to her with her favourite food, she ignores me like I'm air. I'm simply not there to her; all there is, is the wild animal.   If she's off the leash, she will just chase the animal until she's lost it, and then eventually she will come back. Obviously, I'm quite hesitant to let her off the leash now.  How can I start working towards better behaviour around wild animals with her? The main problem that I'm facing is that she ignores me totally when she spots a wild animal, whereas normally she's very attentive. It's hard to do any training, since I can't even get her attention to begin with.  So perhaps I should rephrase my question: how can I get my dog's attention in such a situation? I know what to do once I have her attention, but I simply can't get it in these situations.   The only suggestion I've gotten so far, is to use a remote electric collar, but I'm very hesitant to use these, because they seem rather cruel and I have no experience whatsoever with these. I have always used positive reinforcement training methods, so I simply don't feel comfortable with these devices. She was adopted from an animal shelter, had been through a lot and was a very insecure and even traumatised dog, and now she's a confident, happy, and well-behaved dog (except when around wild animals, of course), thanks to positive reinforcement training, and I simply don't want one of these E-collar to traumatise her again. On the other hand, the E-collars seem like a perfect fit for these kinds of situations and perhaps the only thing that may be able to get her attention when she spots a wild animal, so I would be willing to try this, but only as a last resort.

1824,Regarding bitten from about a 2 month old puppy and risk of rabies,"While trying to feed a stray puppy in my neighbourhood, I got a needle point pierce from his tooth on my thumb, with some blood also.  Immediately I rushed to the Doctor and got myself anti-rabies vaccination.   Doctor asked me to watch out for the puppy for at least 1 week to see if he dies or not.  My concerning queries are:   What is the connection of getting rabies from a dog and his death? Should I be worried if he dies within a week? Does bite from a 2 months old puppy can risk humans being infected from rabies?   Also, this puppy has been ill for past 2 days. (No obvious symptoms and he just seems to be ill because he is neither eating nor drinking anything.) "
1825,Can i feed my hermanns tortoise less often?,"I have two hatchling Hermanns Tortoises both 34 weeks old... Sherman and Tiffany.. Sherman is 5.9cm and 42 grams (perfect weight on Jacksons ratio) Tiffany (now nicknamed BIFFany) is 6.4cm and 60grams!!! I weigh and measure them both every Sunday at the same time.... they are fed only home grown weeds, weeds from my garden and some shop brought florrettte salad to supplement. Sherman is a casual eater he eats a little then rests then eats some more the problem is the Tiffany is like a hoover and will keep munching until everything has gone... heartily eating both tortys portions... this week alone she gained 6 grams and im worried.. what I want to know is can I feed her less often ie every other day until her weight stabilises?? I don't want to do anything wrong or cruel that's why im asking.. I know you cant tell for years but I am convinced that Tiffany is a little girl ( only a guess but she has a tiny tail where by Shermans tail is long and fat and clearly visable). They both live together in a huge tortoise table with correct lighting and heat... but I do have a smaller tortoise table so could separate them for a little while.. "
1826,Are there alternatives to electric fences that use GPS instead of buried cables?,"I have a friend that would like to allow their dog to roam a large, unfenced, yard during the day but an ""invisible"" electric fence would be too prohibitive for the terrain.  Are there any alternatives, like GPS trackers for dogs that have an ""electric fence"" feature, that will train the dog to not stray from a defined area? And how safe would they be? "
1827,Protection of neighbours from dangerous dogs,"My neighbour has 2 large Rottweilers. When these dogs jump up &amp; stand on the wall, they stand at the height of the wall. Their property is lower than ours. We have had a previous incident of attack by a Rottweiler on our short dog.  Whose responsibility is it to ensure their safety, and what are the rules/laws with regards to safety of me from dangerous dogs? How are my neighbours to ensure the safety of their neighbours? "
1828,Is superglue safe for gluing nail caps onto cat claws?,"We use nail caps on two of our four cats (not always the name brand, just whatever is cheapest usually).   The glue that comes with the package seems a lot like super glue (it gets on our fingers ""occasionally""), but it doesn't stay in liquid form for very long once the tube has been opened (I suspect because it doesn't have a very tight sealing lid).   The cats tend to loose 2-4 caps a week, and it would be nice to be able to replace just the handful of caps without the tube of glue drying out before the next time we need to use it. They sell extra tubes of adhesive, but it drastically increases the cost of using the nail tips to use a new tube of adhesive every few days.  Since the nail cap adhesive seems to have similar properties to super glue, is it safe to use super glue to replace a few caps at a time? Or is the nail cap adhesive a special non-toxic formula that only ACTS like super glue? "
1829,"Sometimes my dog refuses to eat, just sits next to his bowls and does nothing","I've got a 2 year old parsons russell terrier, Bentley. He works with me - we do dog boarding and dog sitting from my home and we always have at least one other dog over. Therefore I can never leave his food bowl like i would otherwise because the other dogs will steal it. Most of the time when I put his bowl in front of him he would just sit and stare at me. He doesn't look scared, he just stares and refuses to sometimes even sniff the food. I try to leave him in the kitchen alone to eat but when I come back he hasn't moved at all.   When we don't have any dogs over I leave his bowl on the floor and he will come by himself and eat when he wants to. But that rarely happens, we have dogs over 99% of the time and I can't risk the other dogs getting an upset tummy because of Bentley's food.   All other dogs would eat their meals so nicely, and Bentley would watch them eat but wouldn't touch his own food. I mix some delicious wet food with his dry food and at times I have to put pieces of cheese in it so he will even agree to eat it.  I know he's not THAT picky because he eats his dry food without anything else in it without issues when it's left on the ground. I need an advice on how to teach him to eat what I give him? Because he THROWS UP when he doesn't eat! After having breakfast and skipping lunch he would throw up yellow foam just an hour before dinner! As far as I know it's his stomach telling me it's empty. I know in the wild they can go days without eating, but I'm tired of cleaning throw up that sometimes ends on the carpet or bed, and I'm tired of running through the flat when I hear him about to throw up so I can move him to a hard floor.  I also must say that I myself is a very anxious and problematic person - my family slowly drove me insane in my childhood and I ended up with many psychological issues. Nevertheless I'm 20 and my family still is driving me insane. I get mad (mostly at myself) a lot and I think Bentley can feel it, but there is nothing I can do about it as my family refuses to believe I have any issues at all. Until I make enough money to pay for my own therapy, I'm stuck with anger and anxiety issues.  Also Bentley goes to hide whenever anyone around talks too loudly or yells, like if anyone plays a ps3 game and gets mad at the character dying, he would run away. Even if the other dogs around will see the yelling as play and fun and would jump on me to play!  I need him to feel relaxed no matter what's going on around. He is such a perfect dog other than these 2 issues. Please help? "
1830,Can wild cottontail rabbits interbreed with domestic rabbits?,"If a wild cottontail rabbit and domestic rabbit try to make babies, will they have kits? I know that horses and donkeys make mules what do domestic and cottontail rabbits make?  "
1831,Culural and inter-cat problems with adopting two kittens,"I know this is broad question but I am thinking about adopting a kitten soon. However I started thinking about two for their welfare. However my parents, who live on another side of the world, are a bit terrified:   Their experience with two cats in single household is that it ends with violence, including sexual, between cats when they grow up even when they were fine as kittens. They are a little bit worried about problems with travelling (I don't want to tell them that but I hate travelling and even with one cat I planned to ask a friend to see him/her rather then introduce a cat to stress of international travel). They are also worried that, as I am single at this moment, I may have a trouble finding significant other. They don't buy the argument about kittens playing with each other when I'm away at work as they think that a single one will just sleep through the day.   What should I do? Are they right? Is there any negative stereotype about singles with two cats (I'm currently in Western US)? Is my rented flat (&lt;900 ft sq) too small for 2 cats?  PS. Cats would be of course sprayed/neutered (already by shelter I believe) and stay-at-home. "
1832,How do you prevent a neutered tom from fighting neighbors cats?,"We recently took in a cat (backstory here: Can I guess on information requested by pet insurance forms?). He's been fighting with other toms in the area; sometimes in defense, though also as the aggressor.  He stays in at night, but gets agitated if kept in during the day, even when stimulated, spending a maximum of 30 minutes inside before he wants to go out again.  With humans he's perfectly behaved, having befriended most neighbours and visitors, and even allowing us to put him in his carrier without too much of a struggle and with no clawing despite disliking it as much as any other cat.  I've seen lots of advice on getting two cats to live together as housemates, but can't find much on neighbouring cats belonging to different owners. Are there ways to reduce his aggression short of keeping him inside or moving house? "
1833,My cat got into a fight with an owl. Should I be worried?,A few weeks ago my cat (just barely not a kitten anymore) got into a fight with a small forest Owl. The owl didn't survive this. The cat has not been acting strange since and I noticed no injuries so far.  Should I be worried? Could there be internal injuries that only show later? 
1834,Betta with other fish... a fight? or other cause?,"I have very small tank, and it's my 4th or 5th month that i own a beta (fighter) fish. last day i went to store to change the pipe, that i see those fish, i don't know all of their names, and some in english so i have to describe or show image, ...  i bought a black ghost knife, one of those small cleaner (i think is a plecos), two triangular one that are in the image, and two glass cleaner (as it was wrote in my language) which stick to walls or ground, and 5 very small fish, and 2 apple snail, a gold and a brown one. i though next month upgrade my tank to a big one two, but this morning i notice the watter is so messy, i though maybe the food were too much, or they dirty the watter as they are now too many, but once i back, there were only the beta, plecos, and those 5 small which i don't know their names, including two snail... know i want to know if the snail are poisnous, or the beta hit them hard... what should i do?  I really missed the black ghost knife     i want to make sure what do i do the next time i went to that store... i liked these fishes that i take, so i think i go for same type the next time too...  also if it were beta, on the time of night which i didn't noticed, would it hit my other small too? or i can leave them in this tank together? "
1835,"Best environment and Matches, beside Beta, Snail, and small Plecos","I own a very small tank, which i replace soon, with i think a 40G tank. I had a beta, and yester day i bought several fish, which only the placus, 5 tiny fish, and two snail survived the war, even other kind of aquarium cleaner which i don't know the name didn't survived...   I own a two outlet air pomp, and a very small filter, which take water from below, and release it from the top. i'm not sure about these number but it says F.Max: 500L/H And about air pomp: Air Output: 2×4 L/min  Since my fish death, i searched several things, and i come accross other things too, like snail need ph around 7 i think, or terms like nitrot or something alike, and other things... Also other where i hear that a woman talked about lot of her fish died because of the placus which i always though they clean, but it seem they have more waste that can cause death to other... So does large fish require water replacement in short priod with filter attached? what devices i need to keep them alive? and what's their priority. when should a water change? do i need a live plant environment, and if so, then how should the water get replaced? I think my snail are of the Pomacea canaliculata type, should i raise the level of stone at some point so they can go out side water as i want them to increase? and can it happen in middle of tank so it will split the tank in two section, cause the snail don't become a bait?  I beleave i said many thing, not to answer them one by one, but to understand my need from this question.  Last shot from my Small tank(before fish death):  Regard the photo how fast should i replace my tank, can i wait for next month (20 day in my country).  currently the snails, plocus, beta, and those on the top are alive.  and about the matches, i don't thing i can afford more than 40 G, what can match, and how many should be taken that they can co-exists. i know this is a bit general, but i'm not familiar with fishes as you are so i may learn several name to start with. "
1836,How can I have a cat without a litter box?,"I'd love to have a cat but I hate the smell of cat poop and disgusted by the prospect of cleaning a litter box being my daily routine.   I live in a quiet lane and my house has a quiet large garden covered with lawn. I can also make a cat door so that my would-be cat can go outside freely do her business.   On the other hand, I read horrible stories (like this and this) about letting cats outside. in addition, I cannot afford to buy fancy self-cleaning litter boxes.  So I'm wondering what to do about this. Should I try to suppress my desire to own a cat? Or is it ok to have a cat and let her outside?  Appreciate your hints on this.   "
1837,How to tell if a cat is abandoned?,"What are the telltale signs that a cat has no owner?    Some Context on the cat I'm worried about in particular     I have a cat who jumps through my window into my home and just walks around. He runs whenever someone walks, but he has no problems if there are awake humans (There are no animals in my home, however there are several dogs around)      Recently I started leaving him some food or even feeding him by throwing some food out the window (He refuses to come close). He does seem to be hungry all the time, however he does have a necklace and doesn't seem to be weak (He has to do quite a big jump to get to my windows)      Other than that I know nothing of the cat, except that he panicked the one time I accidentally closed the windows with him inside. I'm unsure if the cat's scamming me for free food or if he's abandoned     Due to that, my question. How can I figure out if a cat has no owner, and if you would so kind (although I do understand it might be too localized), how can I tell if this particular (seemingly fine except for the recent approximation he has made towards my house) cat has an owner? "
1838,White Skirt Tetra,"I recently bought a white skirt tetra, and he seems to be a little on the aggressive side toward one of my Cory Catfish. This Cory happens to bee the crazy one that likes to swim really fast all over the place. When the Cory get's close to the Tetra, the Tetra starts to follow it and bump into it. He keeps doing this, and sometimes he tries to just find the Cory and bully him like this. Is he being aggressive or is he just playing? or is it his way of telling the cory to ""Calm down""? I don't know if I should take out the Tetra or not, but I don't want any of my fish dying either. "
1839,What's the best way to clean a contaminated aquarium?,"I had an aquarium apocalypse a while back.  Overnight, some white fungus grew over everything and killed most of the fish in my 25 gallon aquarium.  Rather than cleaning it right away, I ignored it like a responsible adult.  So now I have dried crud on the inside of the aquarium glass.    I removed everything from the aquarium.  I have all the gravel in a bucket and I was going to wash and strain it.  I suppose I could boil the gravel to kill any remaining mold spores.  What about the plastic features?  Whats the best way to clean and disinfect them to kill any remaining mold spores?  And what about the glass?  Obviously, it has to clean the equipment and be safe for the fish when I add water again. "
1840,Training contacts in agility,"I'm very new to agility, I just started 'researching' about it, so this is a general question about contacts and how to train them.  So contact means that at least one paw is in the yellow zone, right ?  From there you could train stopped contact or running contact. What is the point of a stopped contact ? Is it required for some obstacles ? Or is it just a way to ensure a proper contact ?  Now about the training: is the contact just part of the training of a specific obstacle ? Do you re-train it for every one ? Once it is trained ""in general"", do you have a cue, to help the dog understand that you want that for a specific obstacle ?  What about 2-on 2-off contacts ? Is it just a way to make the training more systematic (the dog will eventually understand that he's asked something specific, and then is able to reproduce it on different obstacles more easily) ? How do you train this ? Is it useful to train it ""at home"" first (like on a book) ? If so, do you add a cue ? With a clicker, would you just capture the behaviour ?  This looks like a bunch of short questions, but I think that one comprehensive answer might clarify the whole problem. "
1841,"How can I help my dog differentiate between ""sit"" and ""down""?","Recently I have come to the realization that my dog doesn't really seem to know the difference between the commands ""sit"" and ""down"". He will usually try one and then wait; if you repeat the command, he will try the alternative regardless of whether or not he executed the correct action the first time. So technically he has learned both, but not really. How can I teach him the difference?  Also, sometimes he will sit or lie down expectantly even before I have said anything. Does this suggest that he doesn't really connect the verbal command to the action? "
1842,Preventing dog from going to highway,"My parents have two dogs. The smaller of the two is used to roaming free, coming back to the yard whenever she feels like it. She's been known to wander several kilometers and then coming back to the house, many times.  My parents just moved to a new place, and in the new place there's a road close to our house in which cars drive fast. (I wouldn't call it a highway, it has 2 lanes in each direction, but cars drive fast.)  One time when we were taking the dogs for a walk, she tried crossing that road and almost got run over. She knows how to cross roads but she's not used to cars that drive so fast.  Now the question is what to do about her. I'm afraid that one day she'll wander off, go to the highway and get run over. What can I do? I can try to make the fence so she wouldn't be able to escape, but I don't know whether that'll work, since she's a small dog so it'll be hard to block every single hole.  Is it possible to somehow train her to not go near that road, or to cross it carefully? She's not a well trained dog. "
1843,How to properly train a dog to come when I call him?,"I think that the most important command that every dog should know and obey is ""Come!"". Or ""Here!"" which is more like the word I use in my own language. I have no trouble with my own two dogs obeying that command, but I've had it so easy because my dogs are of herding breed and they are easy to train to this kind of commands.  So, the problem. My wife is dreaming of a saluki. I have to admit a saluki is very beautiful dog and has a nice temperament, but it is a hunting dog. A runner. I don't think I'll give in to my wife's dream, but just in case, and for curiousity's sake, how do you really drill the ""Come!"" command into a dog's nerve system so that the dog is practically unable not to obey it?  How to train a dog to always come when called? "
1844,Should dogs be allowed to greet each other?,"This weekend has been rich in experiences, both for me and for my dog (who is a puppy). As the weather finally improved, we met many more dogs at the park.   Experience 1 My dog was unleashed. I spotted another dog on the other side of the park that I had to cross and I put my dog back on leash. The other was unleashed. I came closer to the owner and I asked if I could let my dog approach his dog (the other dog was an adult and was not showing obvious fear or anger at that point). The guy said I should not and even asked me to move quickly as his ""dog doesn't like other dogs"". Apart from the fact that this doesn't make sense as he should then be the one putting his dog on leash, do you think we should not at least start approaching, and back off in case one of the dogs show signs of fear?  Experience 2 My dog and the other dog were leashed. My dog is always excited when he sees other dogs but then usually calms down when given the possibility to sniff the other dog (I think this is normal behaviour, especially with a young dog). There was a third dog around. I let him sniff him and at that point both owners could conclude that my dog should be OK. I then asked the other owner if I could approach, but the answer was, ""no, they're on leash so they could get hurt"". I don't think the leash is a real problem here: if they meet in a friendly manner, that's no problem; if they start fighting the leash could be of great help. Of course I agree that we should not let dogs play and get too excited when on leash as it could hurt their legs.  My question is should we have allowed the dogs to sniff and greet each other?  This has the potential to be opinion based, so I'm looking for evidence that one or the other would be better for the dogs. "
1845,Should my cat be allowed some wet food every day?,"My cat is a two-year-old Maine Coon. He's very lean and in good health.  He has all-day free access to his dry food and he eats a small quantity a few times a day. As everything is going well I don't try to keep track of how much he's eating. I just know that everyday I have to add some fresh dry pellets.  However our other cat got sick at some point and the only we found to have him take his medications was to mix it with wet food. We then allowed the Maine Coon to have some as well.  Now it has become a habit and both cats get some (about 80 grams) of wet food every day. They seem to really enjoy it and they will make sure to remind us if we are late !  So the question is: Should my cat be allowed some wet food every day? (potential disadvantages to this, in term of health or unwanted interaction between the two foods?) "
1846,What should I do about a mysterious hole found in one of my cockatiel's beaks?,"First, Some Details:  I have two young adorable little cockatiels named Schala and Janus. They are very sweet and ridiculously human friendly.  They are less than a year old and only 5 days difference in age (they will be 1 in 5 months).  They are born from the same breeder and have the same mother and father.  When they were born, they each shared a cage with many multiple other cockatiels (all siblings of about the same age), but not each other (there were two cages both with multiple other 'tiels. Schala was in one, and Janus in the other).  They have always shared a cage together since I have had them (they were little more than one month old when I got them).  Schala is your traditional yellow and grey 'tiel while Janus is grey and white (his face will eventually turn white, I am told).  I am not sure of the true gender of either bird.  They do vie for my attention almost exclusively, despite spending most of their time together.  They get frustrated with each other sometimes, when one tries to take the other's spot on their perch or my shoulder. By frustrated, I mean that they will squawk a bit and clash beaks with their mouths open. They do this to try to be intimidating to the other one, but I have never seen either one of them try to do the other one any serious harm.  The Problem:  I came home one day and noticed that Schala had a small hole on her beak (about halfway between the sizes of an ant and a ladybug [sorry struggling with something to compare the size to]). It's on her right side, just under the cere, and my first thought was that they fought and Janus got the best of her.  Schala shows no sign of pain, she doesn't favor it or shy away if you try to touch it. Her behavior has been perfectly normal since we have been watching it (it has been about 3 days). It hasn't gotten any worse, any bigger, or changed any color (there is no red or anything, just a small dark hole). Other than the hole itself, there are no other negative signs. She has no trouble getting around, drinking, or eating. I don't think the hole goes all the way through, but it's very hard to tell because it is dark and she doesn't like holding her head still for very long.  I would be devastated if anything happened to either one of them, but I'm not sure what to do. I don't want to end up taking her to the vet if it's nothing (especially if she gets scared, knowing how fatal stress can be for birds).  I thought about getting a divider cage, so that they could still be close, not get lonely, but still be forced to respect each other's boundaries.  Questions:  Is there any chance that this hole could be caused by anything other than her sibling?  Will it ever grow back?  What should I do to best ensure the health of my sweet little 'tiel and hopefully the healing of this little cavity? "
1847,"Why are balls of fur behind my dog's ears, and how do I get rid of them?","I recently came into possession of an adorable Shorkie Tzu - a Shih Tzu-Yorkie mix. She has rather long hair, with tufts of fur (like little balls) behind her ears.  Why do these form, and how do I get rid of them? "
1848,Is overhead cable running leash suitable for all dogs?,"I have been told that such a running leash is not recommended for pyrenean shepherd dog. The advice was, that if I want to let a dog of this breed out alone, I should build a fenced place for him to run without a leash. Using an overhead cable leash would drive my dog insane, or to similarly undesired effect, only I don't remember the advice so well anymore.    This kind of keeping a dog outdoors is quite usual in my country, especially in the countryside, where many dogs are of one or another variety of hunting breeds. Why would a pyrenean shepherd be different? What other such breeds there might be then? And can there be other reasons for not using overhead cable leash? (Naturally only one dog per cable, so they won't get tangled.) "
1849,What should I do if my cat stops eating and starts hiding more?,"My cat is usually really social. Loves to be cuddled, loves being around people, always crawls in my lap. Today, though, he spent the day hiding in my closet and in his cat tree. He didn't really eat a lot of his wet food breakfast, which is usually a big event in this house. He did eat some treats I brought to him, and cuddles when I come to him, but he doesn't really come out much. His eyes are clear, his nose feels the same as always,and he doesn't appear to react at all to me checking his belly and limbs and such for abnormalities (I didn't notice any but I am also not a vet).   For reference, he is about three years old, an indoor cat, and the only pet in my house. I don't have any plants or anything in my house that he could have eaten.   What should I do? Is this a wait and see situation, or a call the vet in the morning one?  "
1850,Is it problematic to encourage a dog to behave one way with one person but not others?,"I enjoy it when my 3 year old dog jumps up on two hind legs to greet me. I also enjoy doing a small dance.  However, I don't want my dog to do with to other people.  So far, this has been his behavior.  He will jump up on me, but not other people. Is this problematic? Am I going to have trouble down the road?  Are dogs able to know that it's ok to jump on me, but not other people? "
1851,My guinea pig is either scared or is excited by my cat?,"When ever my cat comes to sit in front of my guinea pigs cage, my guinea pig Alma continues doing whatever she was doing but after a little bit it’s like she gets excited? She’ll do zoomies around the cage, pop corn and even go to the front of the cage and sniff my cats face. My cat seems really confused by it all, and sometimes gets scared maybe because she’s not acting like prey? I’m not sure if I should be worried about what my cat doing anything as he seems more curious but I’m also not sure if my guinea pig is excited or scared.  "
1852,Something appeared below my cats eye in 12 hours,"Something appeared below my cat's eye. and 12 hours before, there was nothing.  This was him yesterday 00:00    This is him 12 hours later on    First I thought that he might have had scratched himself somewhere, but now, this is him 24 hours later on, right now.    To me it seems like it has grown a little.  We found out this week that he has 3 tumors, 2 in the kidney and one in the intestines. Due to this, he has been barely eating and has lost a lot of weight.  We have a doctor's appointment today, but I would like to know your comments, if you have any idea what the cause could be.  Could be it be mushrooms? Could it be due to malnutrition? Could it be that he has cancer and it has metastasized?  I really have no idea what kind of ""thing"" could grow THAT FAST! "
1853,How do I make my cats scratch their scratching posts?,I bought scratching posts but only 1 of my cat bother scratching it.  They instead scratch my expensive furniture. So what should I do?  Put Catnip? 
1854,How can I help my sick leopard gecko?,"Two years ago my brother got a pet leopard gecko. We still don't know it's gender but I will say him.   For two years he was fine and looked healthy had a fat tail and ate fine. The only problem was that his cage was missing a cool moist hide and only had a warm dry hide, and we rarely even put calcium on his food and mostly fed him mealworms. Besides that everything else was fine. At the time I had no idea his cage was not set up properly and he had to have supplemented crickets because he was perfectly healthy so I didn't do the research, also he was my brothers pet not mine and I was only 13 so it was really my Dad's job not mine. Anyway for the past few months he has started to scab up, get sores, lose weight, stop eating, instead of shedding all at once he is just constantly shedding parts of skin, it looks like some of his bones might be broken, or the tips of some of his fingers might be missing it is hard to tell. My dad took him to the vet and all they did was give him vitamin shots and tell us to bathe him twice a day. I also started doing my own research and made some adjustments that should help him. I built a temporary moist and cool hide for him to go in that he likes more than his warm hide, I give him a bath in warm water daily, I put a wet cloth over part of his tank to increase humidity, and since he is not eating I started to feed him this medicine that as all the nutrition and calories he needs and an appetite stimulant so he will start to eat live insects again.  Even after these adjustments he still shows no sign of getting better and I have no idea what to do. Should I get him euthanized because I think he is in pain or what? Also my Dad is cheap and won't take him to the vet again or buy anything extra.   What should I do ?

1855,Confusion over the term pit bull/terrier,"I understand that in a lot of people's minds, including my own, there is confusion over the term ""pit bull"". I've read the Wikipedia article on ""Pit bull"" and it explains that it's not a a dog breed, but a generic name that encompasses a number of different breeds. Quoting the introductory paragraph:     Pit bull is the common name for a type of dog descended from bulldogs and terriers. The pit bull-type is particularly ambiguous, as it encompasses a range of pedigree breeds, informal types and appearances that cannot be reliably identified.   From this blog there are two photos of dogs that the blogger has labelled the ""Pit Bull Dog"", however after searching there is no officially recognized name of this type. In the blog it is mentioned that this ""Pit Bull Dog"" is also known as the American Pit Bull Terrier, which indeed is a recognized breed of dog.  I'm particularly confused because of the differences in appearance between the dogs in photos purportedly of American Pit Bull Terriers. On this blog site we have these two:     And in other places these are also American Pit Bull Terriers: From Wikipedia:   Top left: American Pit Bull Terrier Top right: American Staffordshire Terrier Bottom left: Staffordshire Bull Terrier Bottom right: American Bulldog  From what I can see there is quite a large difference between the first two photos and the photo at the topleft of the last picture.   Similarly, the following photo is the main photo at the beginning of the American Pit Bull Terrier article on Wikipedia, and although in this case I see more of a resemblance to the first two photos I posted, to me it seems there are quite significant differences. The first two photos show dogs that are much more short-legged and stocky. Also the faces looks quite different to me. And how about the ears?    Assuming these are all photos of the American Pit Bull Terrier (for the montage image I'm referring to the topleft photo only), is it my imagination that there are massive differences between each individual of the American Pit Bull Terrier, even greater differences than one would see between individuals of most other breeds of dog?   And I also found these images in an image search. Essentially they distinguish an American Pit Bull Terrier and an ""American Bully"":      (APBT standing for American Pit Bull Terrier)  I don't know what the American Bully is, but they surely do look like the American Pit Bull Terrier from the first two photos. Can someone help clear up my confusion? "
1856,Will my hamster take damage if I film him with an IR camera?,"I'm currently using my Raspberry Pi combined with a No-IR camera module as a camera to livestream my hamster's home to my mobile phone. Now, the IR-camera itself does not output any good pictures at night without an additional source of IR light.  I was thinking about getting something like this:   Browsing through the web, I stumbled upon the statement that IR radiation may cause harm especially to  the eyes, but also other parts of the body (which I didn't consider before, but sounds pretty logical now).  Now I wonder, would my hamster be safe if he was constantly exposed to such an IR light source? Or would any harm, even the slightest bit, be done to him? "
1857,How do I make my cat accept the new vacuum robot?,"The situation  I recently bought one of those vacuum robots that wander around the house to clean it.  I set it to clean the flat twice a day (it takes ~1 hour to clean the whole flat), and I'm having a problem with my cats.  I have an european/domestic cat and a Maine Coon (both approx 3 years old), male and one female.  The first time I turned on the vacuum, the european followed it a bit scared around all the flat and after few hours it stopped caring too much about it. It simply tries to stay away from it the minimum necessary to feel ""comfortably safe"".  The Maine Coon was on top of the scratch post when I started the first time the robot, and she followed it with the sight all the time without getting down from it.  The problem  I noticed she's very scared of it and she always tries to be in a different room from the one of the robot, but still she always try to keep an eye on it to see where it is.  The real problem is that she isn't scared of it only while it's wandering around, she act weirdly all the day, taking glances at the robot by time in time and walking ""flattened"" when she's near it.  About her  She's usually very social and isn't scared by visitors or anything, she's genuinely curious and never scared. So I'm wondering why she's so scared by this vacuum robot? The weird thing is that the european is the one that usually gets scared by noises and visitors!  They are both scared by my (""old"") manual vacuum and always run in a different room when I use it. Because it's much louder than the new vacuum robot.  Attempts to fix the problem  I tried to make her play near it while it's turned off and to feed her still near it, but she's still quite scared.  How can I make her accept the ""new kid""? "
1858,Mali Uromastyx: Stick thing sticking out of Femoral Pore,"I picked up my Mali Uro today, and noticed a stick/hook thing sticking out of one of her(?) femoral pores. I searched around, and people have mentioned ""bulges"" on the pores, but I couldn't find any mentions of a ""stick-like"" protrusion. I tried lightly pushing on it, but it seems securely fastened to her thigh. Poking at it doesn't seem to bother her either though.  Unfortunately, my camera's autofocus is broken, so the pictures aren't great, but here's what I could get:     Is this normal? I don't recall having ever seen this on any other Uros that I've had.  Also, if someone could give me a hint as to [her] sex, if possible, it would be appreciated. I've always assumed she's female because of her behavior, but she also has male features like yellow hands.    Two days later, and it's still there. It looks like it's actually gotten a little longer. I tried poking at it again, and it still seems like it's well attached. It still doesn't appear to bother her though.  "
1859,Are higher-cost cat foods any better than ordinary ones?,Is it just a sales trick to get us to spend more? What are the ingredients that make it worth the extra money? Would the mid-range food be legal if it was so bad? I refer to wet food. 
1860,How to train a stray cat where I will feed it?,"For several months we have a stray cat visiting our house regularly. She was pregnant, and has given birth to 4 adorable kittens on our roof.  When she was pregnant, we had forbidden her from entering the house by:   picking up and put her outside (mostly done by me) scare her when she approached the door (mostly done by my parents) shut the door right when we see her approach the door   We fed her every few days, but now we don't. However, rarely we still give some leftover (meat or bones) on outside of our terrace. We fed her on the same regular spot.  However, after her giving birth, we allowed her to wander around the house in hope she will move the kittens to our house (not on the roof). Combined with current lack of feeding, this result on her sniffing around the kitchen and stealing chicken meat from our kitchen.  How to solve this problem? How can we establish that we won't feed her outside the regular spot, and we will only do it (maybe) twice a week? "
1861,Can I feed wild Aphids to my Fire Bellied Newt,"I've had a Fire Bellied Newt for going on 10 years now.  I've fed her all sorts of frozen and packaged food, she prefers blood-worm.  I've recently had an Aphid problem with my pumpkin patch and while reading about them I came across the fact that they are favoured by Newts.  I know that Newts are pretty sensitive so would it be safe to offer these pests as snacks for my Newt and give her something more interesting in her diet or is the risk of contamination/contraction too high?  This question would suggest not but I've found references from articles and zoos which state it's generally pretty safe.  Specifically though, Aphids CAN be the target of pesticides although my personal garden has none and is pretty secluded from public areas.  Is there even a way I can make this safer? "
1862,Social component to grass eating,"I am aware that pretty much all dogs eat grass. Some say they puke from it, while mine eats it to soothe her belly when she feels sick. It actually prevents her from puking. My dog will eat pieces of grass pretty much every time we are out and I know dogs who go to a specific place on every walk just to eat grass, so there seem to be plenty of reasons why dogs eat grass.  What I've been wondering is: When we meet dogs that my dog likes (one specifically) they will run and play and then stand next to each other and eat grass together. This made me wonder if there is a social component to grass eating. I've never seen other dogs eat grass together and it usually is my dog that initiates this behavior. As I've now searched the internet for quite a while and came up with nothing on this....  Have you ever experienced this behavior in a dog? Is there any evidence that grass eating can have a social component? "
1863,Are underwater snails strictly bound to 'under' the water?,"I recently bought a little aquarium, which I stocked with live plants to create a sort-of-natural environment.    I haven't stocked the tank with any fish at the moment, but I have noticed some tiny little snails. They must have been attached to the plants and I'm fine with them being there for now. What I am a little concerned about is whether these snails can survive out of the water? I'm currently watching one moving closer and closer to the top of the tank, where there is a small gap to allow air pipes, etc. through.   Is it likely that these snails will venture out of the water, and into my room, and survive to tell the tale?  Can snails found in fish tanks, survive out of water?  Update: snail is breaching the water. "
1864,Burying and growling,"My dog just did something she had never done before. I gave her a treat, but instead of eating it she went outside and started to bury it near our tree.   About two months ago she had puppies and even when they're just walking nearby her treat she starts to growl at them.   Is this normal? Will she hurt her babies? Why has she started doing this? "
1865,How does chewy treats promote clean teeth and gums,"I bought edible Nubz chewy treats and on the bag it says it promotes healthy gums and teeth. How exactly does it do this? Wouldn't it just stain the teeth more? Also, is this actually healthy - should this only be kept as treats or could it be used as a meal?  Ingredients: wheat starch, glycerin, powdered cellulose,dried chicken, lecithin, natural flavor and natural bacon flavor.   Guaranteed Analysis: crude protein 2%, crude fat 0.5%, crude fiver 8% and moisture 15%  Picture of the treat:  "
1866,"Mystery Snail laid eggs in a terrible location-, hatchling health help","I recently put two of my mystery snails together (originally separated between 2 tanks). They spent almost an entire day together ""piggy backing"" each other. Woke up and feed my fish this morning and found an egg sac on my filter (pictured). I'm worried because snails usually lay eggs right above the water line, and the condensation from the tank keeps them moist.... But this will not happen in the position she laid them. I've propped my hood in a manner that might help, but being that far from the surface, will the babies still drop into the water safely? And I'm concerned about them drying up there. I'm trying to avoid removing them to put them in a ""paper towel incubator"" because it can do alot of damage. What should I do? Will propping the hood (like pictured) be sufficient? If not, what's the best way to remove it without damaging the eggs?  Sidenote: I moved the female into this tank because she had shell damage due to soft water, and I wanted to get her into harder water for her she'll as quickly as possible without further malnutrition while I slowly increased gh, so fish weren't shocked. It's only been a week and it's showing improvement, but I'm curious if this will negativity effect the baby snails (if they hatch), or if water quality - not mother's health, is what effects their development? I also cannot increase water level because I have babies in a hang off nursery that hangs low, and they'd have no air at the top if I add water.    "
1867,Blister or infection?,"My dog was neutered about 14 days ago. And the wound healed very well said my vet(about a week ago) and it seemed like it too. However, a couple days ago, right next to the surgical sight (not actually on it), a red blister type thing appeared. And today it's gotten a bit bigger. I've taken a picture and posted it on this post. Is this something to be worried about and needs immediate medical attention? Also, for the last week or so, we've been playing with him and taking him to the park. So could that have aggravated the issue?   Also, I don't know if this information will help, but when we was neutered, they patched him up with medical glue instead of stitches. He doesn't lick the wound nor pay it any attention. He doesn't seem to be in pain either in that area. "
1868,Can Frontline Combo cause short term personality changes in my cat?,"When I‌ apply Frontline Combo on my cat's neck, for a day or so he becomes slow and sort of affectionate! As if a human on opium.   This drug is supposed to deter lice and ticks for a month (though my cat still got lice!).  The ingredients as indicated on the box:  Fipronil 50mg (S)-Methoprene 60mg Butylhydroxyanisole(E320) 0.1mg Excipient QSP 1 pipette 0.5 ml   I'm wondering what are  biological effects of this drug combo?   How does it work in the cat's body and brain?  "
1869,How Can I Bring My Newly Mid-Crate-Training Puppy to My Partner's House to Sleep?,"I have a 13-week old puppy for almost a week now. He's a very good dog but with a lot of very normal puppy qualities (about 50% there on potty training, pretty good at crate-training, chewing on everything until I give him a toy instead, etc).  Normally (pre-dog) I spend the weekend at my partner's house who also has a dog (three-year-old). Also very well behaved but doesn't do crate-training -- sleeps on the bed, etc.  Is there a solution I'm missing to still stay at her house without accidentally messing up my puppy's crate-training?  I originally thought I'd bring the crate with me, but I don't think her dog would allow a dog to be in a crate overnight without trying to play, etc. And the apartment isn't big enough to separate them unfortunately. (Same with my place.) I could let him sleep on the bed there but he's doing a good job at crate-training and don't want to accidentally mess it up. Any ideas I haven't thought of? Thank you! "
1870,Why is my dog suddenly scared of the water dish?,"About three days ago, my dog approaches the water dish like he's thirsty, but dances around it like he's scared of something. He will finally drink, but after annoying the hell out of me with ten to twenty minutes of whining.  He's weird around other things, like corners on a hard floor, doors that aren't open wide enough ... you know how dogs are. He acts like that around the water dish.  So I figure something happened. Maybe water went up his nose or something and he blames the dish. I emptied the water into another identical dish and he lapped the droplets from the old dish without hesitation, but was wary of the new dish.  Is there something I can do? Are there any other ideas? "
1871,Why does my dog constantly try to lick my butt when i get home?,Whenever i get home from work everyday i get greeted by my great dane and he runs up to me in the door way and insists on kissing me but when i walk a little furter he stucks his face up my butt and tries to lick ( keep in mind that i don't let him do this) but my question is that does this happen to anyone else and how have other people stopped this behavior? Thank you!  I understand why he smells me there but why does he lick? 
1872,How I can recognize a queen ant?,It seems it's illegal to ship live queen ants in US.  Therefore how I can recognize if I'm having a queen in my ants colony? Or how authorities would recognize? 
1873,Can I use expired subcutaneous fluids (lactated ringers) on my cat?,I use lactated ringers to deliver fluids subcutaneously on my cat with kidney disease. I noticed today that one of the bags' expiration date has already passed.   Is it safe to use? What are the risks/dangers? 
1874,How can I positively identify a dog which was stolen from me 1.5 years ago?,"I am an amateur siberian laika dog breeder. A year and a half ago, one of my dogs, a female a West Siberian Laika, was abducted while I was away. A dog has been found that may be her, but I need to be able to look at the dog and identify her.   How will I be able to make a positive identification of a dog after 1.5 years? She has no sign whatsoever how to identify her. She was with a male dog and had pups with him, I still have the male dog and some of her pups, could that help?  I still need to figure it out a protocol where I could make a decision like this:  1) test1 Y/N  2) test2 Y/N  ....  decision Y/N  It would be better that I could identify her in 20 minutes or so.  Any help or hint would be welcomed.  I told everybody I could identify her because of some secret mark, this was a lie to be sure they would not try to fool me with an other dog.  Also, I have no photo of her expect a bad quality photo where you can't see the motives and colors of the fur. I put no microchips and no tatoos as I never thought she may be abducted. "
1875,Exercising a Rottweiler,"I'm new to the ownership of a rottweiler and am wondering about how much exercise a young Rottweiler should partake in. I've read a couple of articles saying too much exercise is unhealthy for the joints and muscles of a rottie.  By exercise I mean running which I do a lot of. I am wondering how far or long makes it unhealthy because there are miles of trails I usually go to, so could I rest for a while and then continue further?  Basically what I'm asking:   How far of running(light jog) is unhealthy for a rottweiler specifically? Could I rest with my rottweiler for 15-20 mins and run more? Is running even an effective way of keeping a rottweiler (physically)healthy? [Extra] At around what age should I lessen the amount of exercise  "
1876,Can a grizzly bear be kept as a pet?,"I saw that video a few time ago. It shows the story of Brutus the Grizzly which is living as a pet with his owner.  I take grizzlies as dangerous animals and so I think the grizzly must have been castrated, had his fangs and claws removed ( and so this makes the whole thing quite cruel ).  Is it possible to have a grizzly bear as a pet? Is it legal?  "
1877,Will our cat try and hurt the new kittens he is related to?,"We have a 7 month old male kitten/cat. His mother lives in the same apartment block and she and he have access to eachother's homes. My neighbour who owns the mother watches over our boy while we are at work which helps keep our minds at ease specially as we were easing him into the outside world.  Mummy cat was pregnant with her second litter (she will be spayed soon) when the neighbours left for an overseas trip a few days ago - we gladly agreed to cat-sit as we have done in the past. I didn't put too much thought into the fact that she would give birth while they were away, as the neighbours seemed to handle the first birth so effortlessly.   The 3 babies were born today (Sunday), and I just realised when we are away at work all day, our boy will be in the house with her and the babies. What are the chances he does not understand what the kittens are and will try and play with them? Alternatively, he understands what they are and will try and kill them to claim territory? Looking at the new babies colouring I am confident that they have been fathered by the same Tom that hangs around our area that fathered our boy, so our boy is 100% related to this new litter.  Our boy has not been neutered  - I will be organising soon as soon as time and finances permit. His reaction to them so far has just been to slowly/timidly approach the box, peer over the edge, and then just as slowly retreat. He does this about once an hour, the rest of the time going about his usual business in other areas of the house - playing, napping, eating  - without us even having to encourage him to be away from them. Is this a sign that he has no hostility towards them? I had always thought if a male cat were to kill kittens they would attempt to do it at first sight.  "
1878,How to deal with a big change in a dogs environment?,"I know similar questions have been asked, so I'm going to be more specific about my problem.  My parents have 2 friendly dogs, a beagle and a rottweiler, of 12 and 10 years old respectively. They have lived all their life in a house with a 150 m2 yard, in a city which is fairly dry (350 mm/yr of rainfall). They are used to live outdoors only, and have problems behaving indoors. Out of necessity, my parents are now moving to an apartment and have to give away the dogs, therefore, I am going to take them.  Since I lived with the dogs almost all their life, and I'm still the only one to take them out for a walk whenever I visit, they have a strong feeling for me. The problem is right now I live in a town which has a lot more rain (1910 mm/yr) and a yard which is about 50 m2 with no roof. Plus, my neighbors have 2 female fox-terriers and the yard division is a fence. Me and my wife both work, so the dogs will be alone most of the day and I can't leave them inside.  My question is, what recommendations can you give me to manage this big change? Is this new environment suitable for the dogs or should I find another solution? Is it possible to deal with the rainy environment while keeping them outdoors?  My idea was that my father stayed at my house with the dogs to give them company and watch their behavior until they got used to the new environment. I'm also thinking of building a small roof area for them in the yard. "
1879,"Is it okay to swear at my pet, as long as I do it nicely?","I don't have kids, so I don't have to set any sort of example when I'm at home. So when I'm talking to my pets I will sometimes use swear words towards them.  Like if they run into a wall while they're playing with a toy, I'll call them dumb, or if I'm holding out a treat for them and they act like they want me to bring it to them, I'll usually say something like: ""come here you little [explicitive]"".  I know non-human animals don't speak our language, so they rely on the tone of our voice to understand what we mean.  So is it okay for me to swear at my pets since my tone of voice isn't angry? Or am I demoralizing them in some way? "
1880,"Our cats eyes keep watering but she seems fine, should we be worried?","When we adopted our cat from a rescue &amp; re homing centre a few weeks ago she had very watery eyes.  We were told it was most likely the shape of her face and that she'd been seen by a vet who confirmed there was no sign of infection in the tears.  Her eyes are still very watery and the tears tend to have a brown colour to them, however her eyes are otherwise bright and clear. There is no sign of her eyes being blood shot or the third eyelid being visible. She doesn't fuss at them or show any sign of them irritating her.  So, is this normal? Should we be bathing them? (she hates that)  Any advice would be welcome. "
1881,How should I react to two fighting cats?,"Several questions have addressed how to get cats to get along together.    How to stop two male cats from fighting How can I encourage two cats to get along?  How do we handle two female cats in the household demonstrating alpha behavior?  How to get cats to coexist in peace?  How much dominance is normal in 2 cats at play  Recommendations for introducing kittens to adult cats   Each of these situations has the potential to create a fight between the cats. While the fight is happening, what is the best way for me to react? Should I stop the fight (if so, how) or let it go on, and how can I tell the difference? "
1882,Why is my cat meowing so much?,"Our cat is about two years old and we got her from a shelter. Recently has been meowing almost non-stop as soon as she sees us, unless she's relaxed, like when we're petting or brushing her. I feel like we give her enough attention; we love our kitty!   I've also noticed she meows even more when I'm in the kitchen making food.   They sound like ""happy"" meows (soft, higher-pitched in tone). It doesn't sound like or seem like she's in any pain or discomfort.   Is it because she wants attention? Or wants a sample of what I'm preparing? Is there something she is trying to tell us? Should I even be concerned? "
1883,Are annual booster vaccinations necessary for dogs and cats that are no longer in contact with communicable diseases they're preventing?,"I have 2 pets (a cat and a dog) that receive booster vaccines every year for communicable diseases they're no longer in contact with. They have been adopted from a shelter in non-Schengen area EU country where they had contact with many sick animals with canine distemper, canine hepatitis, etc., but for the last 2 years that I have them within the Schengen area EU, they have been out of that environment, and in no contact with any communicable diseases these booster vaccinations are helping to prevent.  Exclusively from their health point of view, and the health of other animals they're in contact with, is it still necessary to give them these booster annual vaccines, on top of those required by law in my country, like the annual rabies vaccinations? All animals are otherwise healthy and show no signs of being infected or carrying communicable diseases. Is there still any point in them receiving shots for communicable diseases they're for years no longer in contact with? "
1884,"How can I train my cat to stop ""demand meowing"", but not ""request meowing""?","By demand meowing, I of course mean that loud, aggressive, nonstop meowing.  I understand that you can positively reinforce silence by rewarding a cat when it stops meowing (eg, ""Training your cat to be quiet""), but I don't understand what amount of time to allow after a meow for the reward - if she gets a reward as soon as she is silent for one second, doesn't that still reward the meowing? I'm also not sure whether responding to a ""polite request"" reinforces demanding requests, or if these different meows can be treated differently in training.     For example, we give her dry food throughout the day, but if we just   top it up at various times, it may sit too long and not get eaten. If   she tells us that she wants some biscuits, that is helpful. She also   gets canned meat once a day, but lately she's started to become very   demanding up to 2 hours before the usual feeding time. We always wait   it out, and make sure to give her the food once there is a gap in the   meowing, but it is a great distraction up to that point and so far   hasn't diminished the behaviour.      Similarly, we don't want to leave the door open all day; if she wants   to go out, it's helpful for her to tell us. But if it is not   convenient for us to let her out, because we're going out or to bed,   she starts to get very loud and demanding. We do keep a clean litter   box inside for her, and sometimes we'll place her in it in this   situation, but it has never proven effective (maybe because she   doesn't actually want to go to the toilet!). (NB she has never had any issue   with using a litter box, and will use it no problem when it is the   only option [after moving to a new house, for example], but she does   strongly prefer doing her business outside).   Is there a way to stop her from vocally demanding something without dissuading her from politely asking, or is this just too confusing for her? Will us waiting out the nonstop meowing eventually get her to stop doing it in general? Or is there perhaps a way to distract the cat into forgetting about what she so adamantly wants in the first place? "
1885,How to remove a tick on a dog?,"Since I have my dog I check him for ticks when we're back from walks in the backcountry. So today I noticed one, then after checking carefully another one. Hopefully there is no other.  So the question was: what should I do to remove it ?  I had to improvise a bit. I used tweezers, trying to get it as close to the skin as possible (to remove the whole beast). Is there a better way ?  Here is what I removed.   "
1886,What are the effects of ticks on dogs and does it transmit diseases?,"I recently removed two ticks from my dog.  What are their effects on dogs healths? I heard about tick poisoning.  Apart from these direct effects, do they transmit other diseases? "
1887,At what age can I consider that my dog is an adult?,"Unlike humans, there is no legislation that says that at insert-local-legal-age-here a dog becomes an adult. However, there is a lot of information (mostly on food) that is different depending on if your dog is a puppy or an adult.  At 11 months old, I have no idea if my dog is a puppy or not! How can I tell?    I realize that this question is similar to this one (At what age can my dog be considered old?) that was closed for being opinion based. But as I mentioned, since there are a lot of products targeted at ""puppies"" and at ""adult dogs"" I believe that there has to be a factual answer out there, at least in the eye of the food industry. "
1888,"What terms are used for mice that are fed to snakes, and what are their meanings?","This term ""hopper mouse"" just got used in a recent question, and it seems to be a term that only people that have experience with snakes know. So what is a ""hopper"" mouse? What are the other terms used, and their definitions? "
1889,Is my cat afraid of guinea pigs?,"About 8 months ago we got a cat from the shelter. About two months after that we bought two guinea pigs.  The cat seems to be both interested and afraid of the guinea pigs. When the guinea pigs are just eating, sleeping, or whatever she likes to watch them very closely. She even sometimes steps into their pen, sits on the roof of the little house the guinea pigs have. Sometimes she drives away the guinea pigs by touching them, usually when she has lots of energy and needs to be played with. When one of the guinea pigs looks at her directly, she immediately backs off.  When we allow the guinea pigs to roam the living room she keeps her distance though. If a guinea pig comes to close she runs away as if she's afraid.   How can one explain this behavior? Is my cat afraid of them? "
1890,Is it possible to raise a cat not to be a threat to pet birds?,"We own 2 cockatiels but also love cats, so we're wondering whether it would be possible to have one without endangering the birds?  Would a kitten growing up with these birds be friendly with them, or is bird hunting an instinct that cannot be unlearned?  It might be relevant that the cockatiels are not really tame and don't let themselves be petted. They probably would keep their distance from the cat as well. "
1891,How can I eliminate set-in dog urine scent from a carpet?,"Our 15-year-old dog has decided she no longer wants to be house trained.  As a result, we have several set-in dog urine spots in our carpet.    We have a consumer Hoover ""steam"" cleaner and have repeatedly gone over the affected areas on several occasions, but can't get rid of the odor.  Is there any hope for getting rid of the smell?   We don't want to replace the carpet yet, as it's likely she'll keep repeating the behavior.  Are there any ways to effectively remove the smell?  How can I know if the smell is permanent and the carpet/padding need to be replaced?   "
1892,What is the Tellington TTouch method and what are the benefits for dogs?,"The dog of one of my relatives has fear and anxiety problems. A few months ago the vet suggested micro-massaging the dog. I didn't know what it meant at the time.  Recently I heard about the Tellington TTouch method (TTouch if for Tellington Touch) and realised this was probably what the vet was referring to.  The method appear to be based on a set of touches performed on the dog in some specific ways and it is mentioned that benefits include higher relaxation state, increased learning performances, improved injury healing, etc. The picture shows a TTouch being done on a dog's ear.  It has apparently been used with different animals, including horses, dogs and ... humans. The main source of information seems to be the author's website and a bunch of books from the same person.  What is this method and in what cases could its use be beneficial to the dog mental or physical health? Are there scientific data supporting its benefits?  I'm now reading the book ""Getting in TTouch with Your Dog: A Gentle Approach to Influencing Behavior, Health, and Performance"" so I might answer part of the question later but I'm also looking for an answer based on sources or references from other authors.    "
1893,Is it okay to feed my cats canned tuna?,"I opened a can of tuna today and my cats went absolutely insane over the smell. I let them have a very tiny piece and they absolutely loved it.  What I'm concerned about is that it's canned tuna. There's already another question about whether or not feeding fish to cats is okay. But I think that question is asking more about fish that are fresh, or frozen. Not to mention the two answers are divided on whether it's harmful, or okay to feed sometimes.  I want to know if canned fish is okay to give to my cats, at least as the occasional treat? Or there are ingredients in the canned fish that is harmful to cats? "
1894,How to improve the condition of a very fearful dog?,"The dog of one my relatives suffer from extreme fear reactions and his life is about finding ways to hide in a dark corner of the house and spend half a day there.  I'll try to describe the dog's behaviour and give my understanding of the problem. In short: how can we help the dog overcome his general fearful state of mind ?  About the dog  From time to time he just ""shuts down"" when noticing that the owner wants to go for a walk. He'll either hide or just ""act dead"". He often does that while on walk too, for no obvious reason. It doesn't to be related to a specific thing (like cars or other dogs). He think he's in such a general fearful state that with time he associated many neutral situations with things that were initially starting his fear reactions.  He is clearly afraid of fireworks.  The dog was (in my view) not properly socialised and/or exposed to enough stimuli (cars, people, other dogs, loud noises, etc.) in his early life (from 8 weeks to his final shots, probably around 16 weeks). The reason was that the vet advised to keep him in the house for that period to avoid any potential problem before his first shots. Now that I know how important early socialisation is, this seems a bit crazy to me but that's what happened.  The dog is not showing signs of agression. When facing a ""fight or flight"" situation he definitely chose the second option.  The dog is a two and half years old Border Collie, pure breed. I don't have much information about the breeder. The family of the owner reports that the mother was fearful.  So all of that is far from perfect and it is quite sad to see the dog in that state of mind.  I don't have detailed explanation but apparently the vet tried to help the dog reach a more relaxed state with micro massaging. I think he was referring to the Tellington TTouch method (see the related question, the picture there is not the dog I'm talking about here).    Potential solutions and questions  For dogs with specific fear-related problems I think the way to treat the dog is with classical counter-conditioning and desensitisation. However I think the difficult part is that it is too easy to go too far too quickly and to actually flood the dog. There have been many criticism that it is what Cesar Milan does quite often in the presence of fearful dogs (not my goal to start a debate here but in this case it is my main concern).  So as in this case we have a generally fearful dog, how should we proceed ? I don't know if the best strategy is to work on each fear reaction individually, gradually exposing the dog to them. Or if it is better to treat the problem as a whole. If so, I don't know how and I don't know what the techniques are. This is my main question. What is the clinical definition of the situation ? "
1895,Correct use and efficiency of anti-ticks collars,"As I mentioned in two questions (How to remove a tick on a dog? and What are the effects of ticks on dogs?), my dog got a few ticks recently and I decided to act.  The dog had a topical combined treatment (Stronghold: heartworms, ticks, fleas and scabies) over the last months.  In addition we bought an anti-tick collar. The general question is: What is its correct use? (Can the dog wear another regular collar? Should the collar be worn all the time?). Then, if used properly, what is its efficiency: How quickly is it killing or detaching the ticks and are there any side-effects? "
1896,How important is bloodwork before anesthesia?,"Our 5.5y pug had died after his anesthesia started taking effect. He was there for Brachycephalic Airway Syndrome, and seemed healthy otherwise. He had removed few bad teeth 4 months ago with all the blood test being perfectly normal. On clinic, they did ""full workout"" testing and x-rayed his chest. All fine. The theory is, he was living with heavy oxygen debt and anesthesia slowing him down was simply too much. But looking at the invoice and quick call back there, the clinic didn't do any blood tests. They claim it's not a standard procedure and while I understand my knowledge is limited, it's killing me that could perhaps show something and prevent him undergoing the anesthesia.  How important a blood work is? Could it warn about low oxygenation?  EDIT: Clinic has explained a blood testing was deemed not needed according to their extensive practice and what they learned about him from other tests. Their original ""he seemed healthy"" was indeed backed up strongly when described in detail. They did experience a few similar cases but there's still no clue what are the indicators to look for, except all were brachycephalic dog breeds.  Blood test wouldn't help with oxygen level. (see the accepted answer) "
1897,Moving Stray Cats Feed Location A Couple of Blocks Over,"I recently stumbled upon two litters of kittens and a couple of adult cats on my way home. The kittens are not of nursing age and some approach me without issue when I offer food. I started feeding them in the location I would find them as I headed to my own home but now I am hoping to get them to my yard for safer and regular feeding purposes. If all goes well I would even like to try TNR. How can I get the cats to follow me to my home or to recognize my yard as their feeding space when I have already started providing food in the one location? How can I be sure they will find me instead of thinking I just stopped feeding them, when I really just changed spaces? I haven't been doing this for very long so it may be easier to change spaces sooner than later. I just do not know how. My home is about two blocks over from the current spot I see the cats.   Any help or advice is appreciated!  "
1898,Can I take my mini-pig to the beach?,"I have a young mini-pig (he'll be about 8 months old when we're thinking of doing this). We're looking at taking a vacation in the future that would give us a chance to take him for walks on the beach. However, we're a little worried.  I know that sodium can be deadly for pigs. And what place has more sodium than the beach and ocean?! Our little guy loves to root everything, so I wouldn't be surprised if he ends up swallowing some dirt and water--which I know will be chalk full with salt.  Will this be alright for him at 8 months? Or is it a better idea to avoid the beach entirely? Is there an age we should wait for to take him to something like this? "
1899,Why are my 6 flame tetras not swimming like normal?,"Usually I see my 6 flame tetras cooped up in the low corners of my tank. The water temp is perfect, and I am working hard to get the perfect pH level, but when I look at my fish, the’re always either low and close to the walls, or lower, and in the 2 back corners! Are they ok?? They sometimes swim in the open, but for a short amount of time. Please help! I love my fish!! ([website]"
1900,Can feral cats be moved?,"In most spay and release programs cats are returned to the same location they were found in.  I imagine that in some cases the original area is undesirable.  In this case is it possible to release the feral cat in a new area, allowing it to remain feral?  If so what is required to keep the cat in the general area of release?  My basic line of thought is that, there are no outdoor cats in our neighborhood and I would be willing to provide food and shelter if a captured feral needed a new location.  "
1901,Why did all my goldfish suddenly die?,"I have read this question, and this one, about goldfish/pond life suddenly dying. These situations are similar, but not identical to my own, and so I'm not sure whether this question is a duplicate.  We came back from a weeklong holiday yesterday, and had a look in our pond. We were happy to see that our two adult goldfish, and their four new babies were doing rather well. We pulled out quite a lot of pond weed, and topped up the pond with water from the hose. We also sprayed some of the surrounding plants with the hose, and some of the water may have run off into the pond.  We have woken up this morning to find all the fish dead, overnight. There were several tiny fish which we hadn't noticed (they look like recently hatched eggs) which are also dead - around 7 total in all.  What could have caused this? Reading around, it looks as though we may have had an issue with oxygen in the water - my intuition tells me that topping the pond up and pulling out (admittedly a lot of) pond weed shouldn't have caused a problem like that, but is that right?  It looks almost as if the fish were all electrocuted, but our pond also contains rather a lot of water snails, and they're all fine. We have in the past had several frogs residing in the pond, and there's no sign of them (either dead or alive).   The pond also has a lily in it, the flowers of which were pushed under water by the filling up of the pond last night. The pond is about 1 by 2 metres.   We also have two cats (it seems clear that the cats didn't do this, on the basis that all the tiny fish are also dead, and the bigger fish don't look damaged physically on the outside), and whilst I don't think that they drink from the pond, I'd like to confirm that we shouldn't panic and drain the pond or anything right now? "
1902,"How to socialize unneutered female and male rabbit, before or after neutering?","Situation:  We own an unneutered female rabbit, since one week she is alone because her partner died. The search for a new partner is difficult, because we want an adult neutered rabbit-man for her, dwarf, no teddy fur and no lop ears. We have found one male rabbit, but he is unneutered. (Searched in animal shelters and small ad)   Aim:  We want to exclude the cause, that they absolute dislike each other, before we neuter the male. But we do not want the female to become pregnant.  Question(s)  Is there the chance to do so?   Can neutering change something, so it works before, but not after it?   How big is the risk, they see and at once start to mate?  Background  The actual owner of the male would take him back, if the socializing do not work well. I assume neutering is not part of this. Additional I want to spare the male the neutering, if we can not keep him with our female. "
1903,Setting up new fish tank for new fish - will using decor from my existing tank help spur the bacteria growth process?,"The guy at petsmart told me if I used the bacteria-established cartridge filter from my existing tank in the filter of the new one for a few days, it would help set up the bacteria (this is all before adding livestock of course). Problem is that my existing cartridge filter doesn't fit in my new filter for the new tank. Would transferring one of the pieces of decor from my existing tank (that has growth on it) work the same way? Or not at all? "
1904,"I used too much tetra pond algae control, and now my koi are dying","I had 15 beautiful koi, all about 5 years old. They were very healthy, but the other day I put too much Tetra algae control in their outdoor pond, and now 2-3 of my koi are dying a day.  If I put them in another pond I’m scared I will shock them. i only have five left; they seem to be ok, but they may be a little sick. One is just trying to breathe and swimming on its side trying to get air from the pump.  Is there something I can do to save them all? I put the sick one in a pond by himself just to see if he would get better. I didn’t do anything special to the water. I know I should have let the water sit a while, but I had to do something. I did put a small pump in the other pond. I’m sure I will wake up and find more dead koi. Is there any way to help them? "
1905,Cat eye infection,"The mother cat gave birth to three kittens in our backyard, after the first month i noticed one of the kittens eyes have some ""rheum"" and is semi closed. i thought maybe go away by it self (bad mistake)...  In second month when they started walking outside the kitten both eyes was completely closed so i take him to a vet.  (a side note about vet; in the small city where I'm living there is not an ""experienced"" vet which is expert in cats or dogs. they just do cows and sheep vaccinations etc...)  Vet injected a dose of an antibiotic and another dose of dexamethasone and prescribed:   Si fixim syrup 5ml a day Prednisolone 5mg 1/10 every 12 hours Chloramphenicol 0.5% one drop every 12 hours Sterile eye drop every 8 hours B-complex vitamin syrup 5ml a day   It's the third day that I'm using those medications for this poor kitty and even though the ""rheum"" is reduced but his eyes still closed (until i clean it using eye-drops) and still have inflammation. his eyes outside corners is PURE RED(is not visible in the picture) and when i use eye drops kitten is in pain... :(  Other than that he's playful and eats well.  I changed their ""nest"" and cleaned the whole backyard so they can live in an clean environment. don't know what else to do to cure him, he's too young to become blind!  Is vet prescribed the correct medications? if yes why the inflammation isn't going away?  If medications isn't the right one and you're a vet please suggest another prescriptions. i can't afford to take him to another vet. it's pretty expensive in here...   "
1906,Can I leave my Red Eer Slider turtles alone for 4 days?,All my family members (including me) need to leave the city for a family function for 3-4 days. I have 2 red ear slider that I have to leave at my home for the duration.   I have 2 questions:   Can I leave them unsupervised in their tanks with the appropriate amount of food for several days?

1908,Puppy pees when touched or scolded,"One of my female dog gave puppies 4 months ago. One of the girl pup, that's not adopted by anyone yet, still is with us. The thing is, she's brave and confident, but pees when scolded, or when we try to scare or shoo her. After that, she keeps wagging her tail and comes to us for us to pet her, but pees again on the first touch. I've had dogs my whole life, but haven't seen this kind of behavior before. Why is she so scared? How can we teach her not to be?    Also to mention, my young cousins live in the same house, they might tease or hurt her slightly in our absence, but that's happened with all our dogs before too. None of them behaved like she does. "
1909,Do aquarium turtles require basking everyday?,"Sometimes my turtles are not active at all. They appearing floating on surface, not even moving subtle. I generally change water in that case.   But I also think that not giving them proper open air, Sunlight also making them in-active. I am not sure, is it really an issue? If yes, I will make bask every in shaded light near window everyday. If No, how should I handle this situation?  Edit: Added more info.   Light source in aquarium - CFL 8 Watts, only 1 Aquarium size = 24X36x24.5. Gravel at the bottom of aquarium and some plastic flowers for looks. They like sit on them also. I don't how they do but they can spend hours sitting on them. Filter - Two submersible filters. They generally like to sit on top of filter :). Maybe they want to get close to the CFL attached on top of Aquarium.  One Air bubble maker - Air stone strip, so that mosquitoes can't sit on surface and lay eggs. What kind of turtle - I dont know but you can see pictures in my other question here Red flesh coming out my turtle&#39;s tail  "
1910,How quickly do Belgian Tervurens grow?,"I recently got a Belgian Terv puppy. At just shy of nine weeks, he weighed 9 pounds 5 oz. Three weeks later, he weighed 10 pounds 8 oz, a net gain of only 1 pound 3 oz. I was surprised, the vet was 'meh'.  He is eating a 5 star rated puppy food (dogfoodadvisor.com), was one cup 3x/d. Good energy, normal stool, looks healthy, but so furry, hard to tell if he's too thin or not.  I started adding toppers to his feeding and added an extra feeding/day to get him to eat more. Plus, for training treats, I'm giving boiled chicken, beef or other high-quality treats (freeze-dried liver, etc.).  I've looked for growth charts for the breed and I can't find any.  Because of intermittent regurgitation and vomitting, there's a small chance that the pup can have an esophageal or pyloric problem. The pup is scheduled for a visit next week, and if inadequate weight gain, this will be followed by a barium swallow study.  I spoke with the breeder (450 miles away, mind you) who at first wanted to switch out the puppy for another one (what? No, I've bonded to this puppy) and when I ran the possibility of a medical problem by her, she literally screamed at me not to get the puppy tested, not to trust the vet (""They don't know what they're doing! They know nothing about this breed! They're only in it for the money!""), and when I said I would trust the vet, she threatened to reclaim the dog because of abuse, so I think she's out of the picture.  I've tried two other puppy foods to see if the pup likes one more than another. He looks great to me, but definitely smallish.  Any suggestions? (Googling BT growth rates gets me no helpful hits.) "
1911,Seeking advice on planted aquariums,"My aquarium below: (10 gallon),  After the wood sinks completely I want to add a proper substrate and plant some seeds (bought a few online) of various sorts of grass.  Also bought natural substrate gravel but I'm not sure if the grass could grow on it or on the driftwood.  I want to add gravel and plant all over the bottom and on the driftwood if possible.  If anyone has any advice or ideas of what I could buy/change in this setup or planning of mine  Also - recommendations for good gravel for plants (mind the reasonable budget) would be appreciated.    EDIT:  Wood is from shop,  Gravel from here:  [website]On description it is noted as 2mm-4mm in diameter. "
1912,How can I reduce feeding my fish to keep my snail population under control?,"I posted the other week about some snails I had noticed in my relatively new tank; where I was warned that it would be wise to get the snail population under control while I can. Sure enough, the snail population has increased - not to the point where they're out of control - but if they continue to reproduce at the rate they have, I'd give it a few weeks before I've got myself a ""problem"".   I'm fairly positive that they're bladder snails, and I have since purchased two assassin snails in an attempt to keep their population under control - though these guys seem fairly chilled out so I'm not sure how helpful they've actually been so far (FYI, they've been in the tank for four days).   I've read time and time again about reducing the amount of food that you feed your fish, as ""less food = fewer snails"". However, I'm completely unsure of how much less I need to feed my fish to have an impact upon reducing my snail population. My fish supplier suggested to feed twice a day but I'm wondering if once a day may be more helpful to nip this in the bud? Or whether I should carry on feeding twice, and just use less food both times?   Additional info: I have 9 tetra, 3 guppies, 1 bristlenose catfish and 3 amano shrimp. I feed them twice a day (morning and evening), a combination of flakes for the tetra/guppies and pellets for the shrimp/catfish. Once or twice a week I will use a daphnia or an algae wafer alternative for example, to create a more varied diet. I remove any left-over food which is visible to me but I know there will be some which sinks into the gravel and slips through my radar. I siphon my gravel relatively regularly to remove this and there isn't a clear abundance of algae as of yet - but my snail population is still increasing?   I have come to the conclusion that the unseen food is the issue and that I need to reduce the amount I feed my fish to minimise this. And so, my question is:  How can I reduce the amount I feed my fish, to effectively minimise the reproduction of pest snails, without harming the fish? "
1913,Safest way to get rid of cockroaches found close to dog's house?,I recently have found that cockroaches are partying next to my dog's house which is outside in the back porch. I want to get rid of them but since my dog likes to sleep in or next to his house don't want him to smell potentially dangerous pesticides.   Is there a safe way to get rid of the cockroaches without risking my dog's health? I found and sprayed outside his house with a natural repellent named 'Fleriana' that claims to be non toxic and that is safe for pets. It seems to do the trick. 2 days have passed and I haven't spotted any roaches.  Any other ideas/suggestions? 
1914,Taming feral cats,"How do I earn the trust of a feral cat? I do not have meat or cat food, what can I feed them? Should I try to touch them or let them come for me? I have never seen kittens of 1-10 weeks old, where do they live? "
1915,Door Protector for dogs that like to Hang Out the Window,"My dog likes to hang out the window as we drive. And, as a matter of clarification: He's in a harness attached to the seat with enough room for one leg to dangle (and scratch things) (It gets adjusted as needed to keep him safe from falling out). This is fine in my car, as I've already dinged it up and I don't care about the paint job (I drive em till the engine drops)...   But in other cars - including Hers - we do care about the paint job and have a desire to get or do ""something"" to protect the door - inside and out.  I like the look of this from Amazon:   And we like the looks of this as well:    One is ""Magnetic"" and sits on the outside... the other is cloth and sits on the inside - protecting inside and out.  The issue is that we'd like a single item, if possible (since the window DOES need to go up and down). Maybe the second one, with magnets added to keep it attached to the door on the outside?  Does anyone have tips/tricks/suggestions on how to protect the inside AND outside of a door for a dog who loves to ""hang out""? There seems to be plenty of options for the inside of a car... but not many for the ""Outside"" and nothing that does both that I've seen. "
1916,What should i do with my parakeet is still on her eggs after 30 days and what happen to her?,My parakeet is still in the nesting box with 7 eggs and it been almost 30 days and she is still on them ? What should I do ?? Will she have more eggs soon or do I remove everything? I have 3 females and 2 male in the cage? Should I leave the box in the cage? 
1917,How does a snail clean a fish tank?,"I don't keep fish, but I've wondered about this.  From what I understand, snails are introduced to a fish tank to keep it clean.  Fish produce waste and the snails eat this along with algae.  Don't the snails themselves produce just as much waste though?  Are we just converting one kind of wate into another?  Why doesn't this need cleaning? "
1918,Can animals count?,"So this is the question: can animals count? If so, and if it implies some intelligence degree, why they fail to do less complex tasks?  For instance, a female duck may lay eggs in a tree hole. The offspring need to jump from the tree as the mother calls them in the ground. She will wait until all of the little ones are with her: so she knows somehow to count. Correct? That proves some level of intelligence. However she is not wise enough to round around an obstacle like a mesh panel or a fallen tree branch to get more food. Why?  Please only serious and solid answers.  Thx  p.s. I'm not including those with ""sufficient"" intelligence, like simians, dolphins, etc. "
1919,What might be a typical stomach ulcer healing process and timeline?,"Sadly, my cat (11yr, male neutered) was recently diagnosed with moderate inflammation of his intestines (IBD) and a stomach ulcer.  Which explains his occasional vomiting over the last couple of months, which suddenly increased to the point where he refuses all food and is on a feeding tube.  The longer-term vomiting is likely due to the IBD, but the food aversion and severe vomiting is likely due to the ulcer (according to the vet who did the endoscopy). At least it wasn't cancer, it seems like?  My cat is now on a number of anti-nausea drugs (metoclopramide, cerenia, and ondansetron) and also ulcer medication (sucralfate).  Of all the nausea things, only metoclopramide seems to actually do much, which makes its 4-5h duration rather unfortunate (he'll vomit up to dry heaves despite the other two, though only done 2 doses of ondansatron so far). Mostly, he just hides himself away feeling sick and his only enjoyment is chin scratches.  Has anyone else had a cat with a stomach ulcer and have insights on the typical healing process?  I am particularly wondering how long the healing process is likely to be.  I should ideally be introducing foods to eat, but there is really no point right now when his primary mission in life is currently ""Hide behind the couch and try not to vomit on myself."" However, it is my understanding that his appetite should probably return once the ulcer is resolved. Anyone have insight or tips about a typical successful treatment process (e.g., medication issues, dietary, how long it takes a stomach ulcer to heal)?  Update Note: It might actually be the sucralfate that is the only one that does much, rather than the metoclopramide.  I tend to deliver their doses close together, and their durations are similar. When I recently gave the sucralate a bit later, he tossed his cookies despite a metoclopramide dose.  Update 2: Unfortunately, the poor boy did not make it. The ulcer would not heal for some reason, leading to persistent anemia and death.  Lack of B12 due to his earlier vomiting might have been a contributing factor (he got a shot, but probably too late). As a note, switching from Hills a/d to Royal Canin Pea-Duck did help him stop vomiting and keep food down, but he was just too weak couldn't recover. If I could re-do this in a similar situation (ulcer caused by IBD), it would be to:   Switch immediately to a high-calorie rare-protein diet (pea-duck is good, about 190/can, while venison and rabbit are lower-calorie, at least for Royal Canin) Start on weekly B12 shots as a preventative measure (they're cheap and shouldn't hurt anything even if unneeded), and Get regular bloodwork done so you can track trends for healing of the ulcer (at least once per week). Drooling - Be aware that excessive drooling may not be due to nausea, but might be due to anemia also. Hind leg weakness - Be aware that weak hind legs is often related to nervous system issues, such as those associated with B12 deficiency (which can be caused by vomiting, diarrhea, or lack of absorption due to bad IBD). Consider switching food as soon as bile vomiting starts to increase (e.g., vomiting on a mostly-empty stomach, rather than during or directly after feeding), since kitty's immune system might have started rejecting that type of food (seems to be what might have happened with Hills a/d, which worked great for 2 days and then went rapidly downhill). IBD sometimes means the cat's gut will learn to reject certain foods, so just because a food worked well at one point doesn't mean it will be good even a few days later.   All of these in addition to the standard of care (e.g., sucralfate).  All of these eventually were used for my cat, but not all of them were immediate (and they could have in theory all been started up-front). There's still a pretty good chance my cat would not have made it, since the ulcer was not healing well, but it might give a bit more of a fighting chance. "
1920,"My dog is becoming unusually hyper. Whining, won't hold still, and jumping/nipping at me","My dog is just over a year old, so full blown puppy stage... but she is constantly hyper. I don't mean like burst of energy then she lays down. She is always moving. I'll play with her, take her on walks, let her go to the bathroom regularly...but she just jumps on me and whines like she needs something, then when I pay attention it's more play. If she does sorta lay in my lap she's constantly moving positions and biting at my hands and legs. Then I'll pet her and she'll start play growling and biting more. It doesn't matter how many times I tell her 'no'. She keeps doing it. It doesn't matter how much I play with her, She is never tired. Is ADHD in dogs? She did jump out of my hands when she was little and hit her head on concrete.. could that be it? or maybe the breed? She's half Mini Schnauzer and then the other half was a mutt that I think was a Chihuahua-terrier mix.  I don't know what else to do. My boyfriend hates her because she does the same thing to him. She's sweet if you can get her calm enough for a few seconds..I hope she grows out of this. Her mom was my dog too and was never like this.  "
1921,Can cats release faeces from getting scared?,"Yesterday, I was taking care of the trash. I took out the regular black trash bag and opened it through swinging it around (I hope you get what I mean). I was in the kitchen, which is right next to the stairs.   When I started 'swinging' the trash bag, one of my cats started running down the stairs like she was being chased by a dog. Long story short, she ran down the stairs so quickly, and then she dashed right under the trash bag and ran for the living room.  From my understanding, she must have been on the stairs, because I expected her to run as far away from the sound of the bag (she should have ran upstairs in this case), yet she went downstairs.   Now, here's the dilemma. Around 5 minutes after my cat dashed to the living room, I went upstairs and found something dark on the floor right on top of the stairs. The room wasn't lit up at the time so I touched it to verify what it is. It was poop, and it could be easily said that it was recent. This is the first time it happened. I mean, my cats already heard the bag and so I already know that they are terrified of the sound it makes. They have never had an accident with releasing faeces or peeing anywhere other than the litter box.   The thing I am confused about is whether that bag really scared her. I mean, the poop is there and that's a clear sign that it all happened at the same time, but my cat was at the top of a fairly long staircase. It's so long that I really doubt she would have ran down the whole set of stairs, and if anything she would have ran to a room upstairs.  What do you think? Is it likely that she released faeces due to getting scared?    Rejected edit note: Suggested edit has changed the word ""faeces"" to ""feces"" only in the title, while the edit should have also pursued the spelling of the word in the question body. Faeces and feces are both the same. I am using faeces due to the area I live in. Feces is used in North America according to this site, however both versions are technically correct. "
1922,What is best material for ground cover of an outdoor dog run?,We want to build a dog run in the backyard for our German Shepherd pup.  She likes to chew rocks.  Horse stall rubber mats? Cement blocks? 
1923,Minimum fence height for Labrador Retriever?,"I have a 10 week old purebred female yellow Labrador Retriever. She was bred from a various bird hunting family, and their dogs are slim and in great shape. From what I could find online, they are more of an 'English' style Lab, even though it appears there is no official distinction.  I am going to build a fenced area in my back yard that has shade/sun/cover. We already have a larger back yard that is fenced at 6 feet high, but I don't want her roaming the whole back yard during the day while we are gone. The long term plan will be that she can go outside to it via a dog door at any time when she is older and can be left alone without needing supervision during the day.   The overall area of this will be 300 sq. ft.  The problem is that I don't know how high I should build the fence so that she cannot jump over it when she is fully grown/most capable. I've heard a lot of conflicting numbers from other websites, with some stating their dog jumped over a 6 foot fence!? Is that even possible?  I respect the SE community answers, so I've come to ask what you think. "
1924,Why is there a worm in my dogs waterbowl?,So my puppy has worms she's been dewormed 4 times and still has them! The worms that come out when she poops look like rice and today when I went to clean her water bowl out there was one of those worms in it!!! Why is this??? Please help me thank you 
1925,Can I put 2 different batches of baby rabbits together,"I have 2 does and one buck, both does are pregnant and I want to put them together with their kits. I have 1 huge cage because I want to put the baby rabbits in there with their moms. Will that be okay or will they kill the kits? One of the does is 6 days behind the other.   I am going to separate them, for when they give birth and build nests, for two weeks. After that, will it be okay to put the kits and their moms together? "
1926,How to prepare for cats well being if I die suddenly,"I am sixty-three my cat is four, we live alone. I am in good health, my vet described my cat as ""spoiled"" and had nothing bad to say on her home visit, so no expense is spared if anybody has ideas for her safety in the long-run.   Or am I just worrying unduly?  Suppose I have a heart attack and she is left unfed? I want to know about alarms that alert the Police or whoever could get to the cat. "
1927,At what age should I start trimming a bearded dragons claws?,"I have a baby bearded dragon (3 months +/-) When should I start looking to trim her (suspected but not sure) nails? and would it be prudent to just leave some sand paper in her cage so she can ""file"" them while running around? "
1928,When do Star tortoise lay eggs,I have a pair of Indian Star tortoise. I have make them to stay together since last one month. What is duration that my female will lay egg after breeding? Also How much time it will take for a baby to comeout once the eggs has been laid?

1930,Why does my rabbit try and make my bed wrinkle free?,"Ruby is a 3 year old English spot, she lives in our bedroom.  I don't have video but I did find a couple of videos online, they show a little of the behavior. I have talked to others who's bunnies have the same habit, so it seems pretty common.  It is hard to get good video because once I get the camera out she gets distracted.      Rabbit making bed (youtube) Happy Bunny Rabbit Makes a Real Bed - Cute &amp; Funny (youtube)   It will often happen just as I climb into bed, which makes wrinkles.  She jumps up on the bed, gives me kiss, then starts pushing the wrinkles out of the bed.  Her hind feet placed firmly and she pushes out with her front feet.  She moves forward and pushes some more.  After a couple of minutes she stops and snuggles in for bed time petting and snuggles.  The other time it happens is shortly after my wife makes the bed.  Ruby will jump up on the bed and make sure all the wrinkles are pushed out.  She will occasionally dig a bit like you see in the videos, but it is 90% pushing.  Some times she pushes so far ahead that her back feet slip out behind her and she is stretched out in superman position (arms straight ahead, feet straight back, and on her belly).  I can understand the digging behavior, but what is it that causes a rabbit to push wrinkles out of the bed?  "
1931,How can I stop my neighbor's dog from jumping the fence?,"I have two dogs and a big back yard, and my neighbor also has two dogs.  For a long time, when ever I've been playing with my dogs in the back yard, one of their dogs whines because it wants to play.  Several months ago, she dug under the fence in various places along the fence line.  My neighbor is lazy and did nothing to prevent it (he does not train her or even take her on walks, so naturally she wants to come over to my yard because she is bored).  To remedy the digging, I put cinder blocks along most of the fence where she was digging under.  It worked for a while, but then last week she managed to jump over the fence while I was playing.  My two dogs were out with me, and she got in a fight with one of mine and injured her.  Since then, the dog is very determined to come over now that she knows she can jump the fence.  My neighbor is in denial that she is jumping, even though I have personally witnessed it two times now.  I told him several times that she needs to be taken out on walks so she is not so bored.  Anyways, it's gotten so bad now that I can not let my dogs out in the yard without their dog coming over.  Just now, I let my male dog out and was playing fetch, and within one minute I saw their dog jump over the fence.  She got in a fight with my dog, but luckily my male is a bigger and he put their dog in its place and I was then able to tie her up.  My other female dog is still recovering from her injury.  I am afraid to let her outside because of their dog, but she is very depressed from sitting inside.  Does anyone know what kind of legal action I can take (in California) to resolve this?  Talking with him has gotten nowhere - he clearly does not care and won't listen to my suggestion to either put her on a long leash in the backyard or to keep her in the house.  Am I allowed to take their dog to animal control if she comes into my yard?  Can I get their dog taken away from them?  I feel sorry for their dog because it's not her fault - she is bored and neglected and her owner is irresponsible.  She also has behavioral issues which will only get worse.  She is young still so with training she could be a great dog, but her owners are setting her up for failure.  What can I do? "
1932,"Why are my goldfish acting this way, and how can I remedy it?","So I bought two goldfish on Wednesday, and the shopkeeper did not tell me to cycle the tank or anything. I bought the gravel and tree on Thursday and my auntie gave me an air pump and filter around Thursday tea time.  Today (friday), I bought some weekly cleaner to kill ammonia and nitrates. I washed the gravel and tree using fish tank water. This morning they looked okay, swimming around, but I had to move my 10 liter tank as the wires are tripping hazards.  Before putting them in the tank I left them in a bag to get used to the water, after adding the weekly cleaner and changing some of the water, it still looks cloudy even with the air pump and filter.  Now they are going to the side of the tank and trying to swim to the top but floating back down and swimming backwards so I turned the air pump off, and they are barely moving now, just sitting on the bottom behind the tree. Here is a video to help understand: [website]Why are my goldfish acting this way, and how can I remedy it? "
1933,Have there been cases of cat owners in high rise apartments being legally required to install screen (safety nets) on windows?,"Sure, cat owners should worry about their cats jumping out the window.  I'm concerned with negligent/irresponsible cat owners.  For example, what if I see my neighbor's cat everyday on an open window of a high rising building, and I warn the owner about the risks, and one day the cat falls.  So my question is: Are you aware of cases in which owners were held legally responsible in those situations? Or do you know of a SPCA chapter lobbying for passing local laws requiring cat owners living in apartments above, say, fourth floor to install screen (safety nets) on windows? I know of apartments where different tenants have had multiple cats injured and die over the years. Unfortunately it seems acceptable for well-meaning though inexperienced cat owners to dismiss such real risks. "
1934,Why does my cat have an upset stomach?,"I typically feed my cat a boiled fish fillet, ""Hoki"" ... ([website]This week we ran out of the Hoki and it was over a day before I could get back to the store to get some, so was feeding my cat canned tuna in the meantime. When I reached the store I discovered they were out of it, so settled for mackerel pieces instead... I boiled these up last night, removed all the bones, and tested him on a handful of it. He loved it initially, enthusiastically chomping away... and then I was shocked to see him walk away from it leaving 50% of it untouched.   After 15minutes he had a burst of diarrhea in his litter-box. I threw the rest of the mackerel away.  Half an hour later he had another burst, after which he was licking/cleaning his genetalia incessantly, and hissing at me if I tried to go near him (he wasn't like this with his previous diarrhea attack a month ago). I went to bed and woke up several times in the night to see him sitting in my bedroom, yet again cleaning his private parts each time.   This morning I inspected the house for any more diarrhea bursts, I could only find what looked like some streaking on the rug, but not sure how that would come about if he was cleaning himself so diligently. Was it a case of 'leakage' that he was trying to deal with, and what happened on the rug was him momentarily giving up on cleaning it away?   There was also a small pool of vomit with  large chunk of undigested mackerel in it. This morning he was still cleaning himself, and hissed at me again when I tried to go near him. He also refused to eat any tuna and curled up in the dining room to sleep at a time that he does not usually go to sleep. I noticed he was also working his mouth a lot, licking his chops as if he had just had a large meal. I did manage to pick him up for a while to hold him up to some running water as I was afraid he wasn't being proactive with his water bowl. He drank a lot of the running water.  He woke up again when he heard me going outside to put out the trash and came out to play in the garden momentarily... he seemed his old self for a bit, but is back inside curled up asleep again.    Do you think it was the mackeral that is causing this, or the 1.5 days of canned tuna?  "
1935,Is it normal for my dog to be sick after worming?,"I have a 11 month old female Weimaraner and every time we worm her she gets quite sick. Symptoms are lethargy and vomiting (usually she vomits only once).   We are currently using Panoramis Brown (27.1kg-54kg) but she only weighs 26kg, this is what the vet recommended. We had previously used Advocate but we switched because it was making her sick. We also worm her during the day on weekends so we can watch her, and never on an empty stomach.   Is it normal for dogs to be sick after worming? Should I try a different worming tablet? "
1936,Why does my cat lick the fur off her lower belly?,"I have a cat who licks her lower belly almost bare.    The bare patch extends forward just past her rear nipples.  She started this behavior a year or so ago, when she was around ten years old. The height of the fur in this patch varies: sometimes it is almost bare, other times (such as in the picture) it appears she is letting it grow.  She also occasionally bites at the area, so there are a few spots that look like scabs.  Her sister, from the same litter, does not have any of these habits.  A vet told me it was a psychological issue, and he gave her a shot which helped for a week or two.  Why does my cat do this? Would a vet be able to make her stop? Is it worth being concerned about? "
1937,Do I have to stop using halter leash/gentle leader?,"We bought a head halter/gentle leader leash for our two puppies in an attempt to stop them pulling so much on their leash during walks.  The leashes are great because they mean I can actually walk both my dogs at the same time without them pulling me in a direction when they decide. Most of the time on walks they are off-leash anyway, but in populated areas I like to keep them on their leashes to ensure they don't attempt to jump/say hello to passers-by who would rather they didn't have muddy paws all over them!  My question is, my dogs are now over a year old - is there a limit to the age at which these leases can be used? Are there any negative effects of using these kind of leashes over a long period of time? "
1938,Light Spectrum Visible to Hamsters,"I'd like to build an infrared tachometer for my hamster's wheel, but I don't want to distract him with a light source. Therefore I want to choose the wavelength of the LED for my hamster not to see it. Being a nocturnal animal I suspect him of having some IR sensing capabilities.  What spectrum of light does a hamster notice? As a bonus question: Are they colorblind as many sources say? "
1939,Using cornflour to save a leaking egg,Somebody posted this picture of a leaking gecko egg on Facebook and asked for advice to save it.     Leaking fertile egg :( laid 9.3.14. Any ideas to save it?         People suggested sprinkling cornflour on it to work as a sort of paste to seal it shut.    Is this sound advice? Could there be any possible side effects?  They advised localising the sprinkling on the split area. Are there any other things like that to watch out for? Are there any alternative methods for saving the egg?  
1940,What are the stages in a leopard gecko's life cycle?,"What is the life cycle of a leopard gecko? What different stages of development (hatchling, sexual maturity, ""menopause"" equivalent) are there and at what age do they occur?  Is it different for male and female, or the same? "
1941,"What is a ""rub""?","I keep seeing the word ""rub"" when people are talking about reptiles (it was also possibly used in a conversation about rats, but that was a while back and I might be misremembering).  From context, I can tell it's a container pets are kept in, but I can't glean any more details than that. What exactly does it mean? And does it apply only to reptiles, or can it be used for amphibians, arachnids, small rodents...? "
1942,How to choose good plants for a tropical fish tank?,"If I was considering building out a tropical fish tank for my home and wanted to create a good landscape (waterscape?) for both the fish and our visual impact, what are some of the things that I should be considering in my selection and are there examples? Are there special lighting considerations? Filters?  I would probably be keeping fish like tetras, corydoras, and similar.  "
1943,How do I get my cat to wear a tuxedo for several hours?,"My cat is quite dapper and handsome, so when we sit down for a candlelight dinner, he should have the proper attire.  Therefore, I would like for my cat to wear a tuxedo.    What is the best way to get my cat to wear a cat-sized tuxedo or tuxedo costume?  I plan for him to be dressed this way for several hours.  I may expect him to wear the tuxedo for consecutive days, but generally only for special occasions.  He will not have a cane, but answers should consider that I will potentially give him a top hat.  Bonus points if you can figure out the monocle.  Of note, Mr. Pickles is going to be sharing a nice candlelit dinner with me, and consuming food on his own; therefore he cannot be restrained or otherwise rendered incapable of doing so. Valid answers must take this into account.  To summarize, what's the best way to keep a semi-complex costume on my cat? "
1944,How can I tell when I need to trim my goat's hooves and how do I tell if I've trimmed them short enough?,"How can I tell when I need to trim my goat's hooves? I trim them regularly but am not sure if I do it often enough or if I'm being over-zealous. Or maybe when I'm trimming them I don't trim them short enough so I have to do it too often?  Also, when do you start trimming a kid's hooves? Is it a certain age or does it depend on the length of the hooves? So far I've been doing it just a very little at a young age with the idea of getting them used to it young. "
1945,"Our sheep had too many babies and was temporarily paralyzed, how can I prevent this from happening again?","A couple years ago one of our sheep had five babies. They all survived but one had to be fostered to another mom and a second had to be bottle fed. The mom was temporarily paralyzed in her back end. We took care of her, moved her around on a tarp and made sure she stayed in the shade and had food and water and a few days later she was able to get up again and eventually was back to normal. Obviously, we won't let her mate anymore, on the off chance she would have too many again and be hurt.   But how can we make sure this doesn't happen again? The year that happened many of the Ewes had more than two. Is it possible that it's because they had too much nutrition and were overweight? The Ewes in general were VERY large that year. The babies from the other Ewes also seemed to be pretty big. We want to make sure our sheep stay healthy and not overweight so that their pregnancies are dangerous. How can I prevent this scenario from happening again? "
1946,Should I feed hot dogs to my dachshund?,"I am considering feeding my dachshund some hot dogs and/or sausages. I witnessed my friend feed his dachshund multiple sausages, and the dog seemed fine afterwards.  Is this wise?   Beyond having society label him a ""cannibal"", are there any actual inherent dangers to feeding my dachshund (or, for that matter, any canine) a hot dog or variant thereof (frankfurter, sausage, bratwurst, kielbasa, blood sausage, etc.)?  If there are dangers, what are they?  Does it matter if the hot dog is pork, beef (Kosher or not), other meat (chicken, turkey), or vegetarian (soy, etc.)?  Are there safe hot dog-esque alternatives?  Essentially, I'd like to know how safe it is to feed hot dogs to a dog. "
1947,How to treat a 20 year old cat with pancreatitis?,The vet said my 20 year old cat has pancreatitis and possibly parasites. Would you give her an antibiotic? How would you treat her?   ALT. (sgpt). 112 BUN. 51 Precision psl. 42 Lymphocytes. 954 Eosinophils. 1484   What would be your diagnosis and prognosis?  All other levels are normal. 
1948,Preferable flows in aquarium?,"I am in the process of setting up an aquarium, and experimenting with the water flow.  It's 100x40x60cm (60cm high). I employ an HMF in one of the back corners, so there is no well defined ""inflow"" - water is entering the HMF over a large surface area.  The output is currently a relatively tight beam on the top edge of the HMF, blowing diagonally horizontally  across the water surface, then finding its way downward at the opposite side of the aquarium, while the side nearer to the HMF sees only very little movement. There is quite some motion going on at the surface, in a relatively tight stream originating at the outlet.  Is this generally an OK approach? How would I know whether everything is fine or not? I see no immediate problems, maybe except for the fact that larger plants near the ""hard"" part of the stream will be quite impossible (which in fact could be a problem for me; I'd like to have plenty of plants in the background...).   Right now, since there are no animals yet, it is a good time for experimentation. I use a 3D printer to make my own pipe/fitting stuff, so am not limited in any way either.   TL;DR: What would be the ""standard"" / optimum way to distribute the water in such an aquarium?  EDIT: The HMF (Hamburger Mattenfilter) looks like this: [website]"

1950,Cat making herself dirtier by grooming,"My elderly cat has been having some teeth trouble, which may be related to what is going on. She eats only wet food, and after eating she will groom herself as normal. However, it seems that she still has food in her mouth when she starts grooming, because she only makes her fur dirtier. Is this because of her bad teeth? Aside from fixing the tooth problem (it will be a while before she can have surgery) is there anything I can do to discourage this? "
1951,In which case rabbits give noise?,"My female rabbit gives noise if she is grooming her back. It sounds like her breath gets out because of to small space for air in her lungs. Like a human with a big belly making noise by getting the hands to the feets.   Now I am worried if she has pain, because I heared, rabbits gave no noise, only in big pain.  When do rabbits make noise? Are there reasons not connected with danger or pain? "
1952,Preventing inbreeding in Muscovy duck flock,"I have 4 adult muscovy ducks. A drake and hen each of blue and black. I have no idea of their lineage, so they may or may not be related, as they all came from the same flock. The black hen has a dozen 5 week old ducklings, and the blue hen is sitting on approximately another dozen eggs, due to hatch in the next couple weeks.  What steps should I take to avoid issues like birth defects due to inbreeding? Is it necessary to get rid of all the drakes (including babies), and introduce new drakes to prevent problems? "
1953,Is there any research showing dangers to cats from dried Permethrin?,A sister site has a post Is Permethrin safe for cats after it dries? it has a well referenced answer saying that cats should be kept away from Permethrin before it dries.   But there have been some answers and comments suggesting that some veterinary professionals believe Permethrin can harm cats even after it dries.    Is there any research showing dangers to cats from dried Permethrin? 
1954,How to litter train a cat if both my husband and I work away from home all day?,"My 8 years old boy loves cats, but I work a full time job and of course my son would be at school at the same time that I work.  I would like to get a cat, but am concerned about how to litter train it if I'm not with it all day. Is it something easy? How long does it take to get it trained? "
1955,Mother Cat Attacking 3 Weeks Old Kittens,"My pet cat has two kitten, each 3 weeks old. Suddenly I'm noticing it sometimes bites and scratches the kittens with legs when making ""meow"" like sound.  Is it normal? Is the cat only attacking the kittens playfully or to teach? "
1956,Do cats learn how to hunt from their mothers?,Do cats learn how to hunt from their mothers? Do orphaned cats not know how to hunt as well or at all? 
1957,"Accidentally gave dose of antibiotic 8 hours early, 4 hours after the last. What should I do?","About a week and a half ago I adopted a kitten from a shelter. Within the first week he began showing signs of an eye infection. Quite severe by my standards, but I’m not a vet. I took him to the vet and she told me that to give him .25ML of clavamox every twelve hours. On the box it says  “when reconstituted each ml contains 50mg of amoxicillin and 12.5 mg of clavulanic acid as the potassium salt”. However, she also prescribed him eyedrops and I accidentally messed up the times to give them and gave him a dose of antibiotic when he was supposed to get eyedrops. This makes it a dose given 8 hours early, or 3.5 -4 hours after his last dose. He weighs a bit over 2lbs.   Now I am at a loss as for what to do, I cannot call my vet as it is nearly 2 in the morning. Do I give him the eyedrops? Is this a death sentence?  "
1958,Why does the Dog let its head drop hard onto the floor when it rests?,"My sister owns a Bernese Mountain Dog of about four years old, which she had since he was a few months old, and appears to be in robust health. He gets his check-ups and no red flags have been raised. The dog likes to relax in front of the fan or radiator, depending on the weather, and my sister's house is mostly laminated wooden floors.  When the dog decides he is ready to lie down and have a rest, he will lay down like any other dog but when he lowers his head to the floor, it's as if he just lets it fall without effort. It always hits the floor with a noticeable thud! It is the kind of noise that makes me think it would be painful or uncomfortable for any other dog (or a person). Even with other Bernese dogs, I have never noticed them do that. The dog has done this for as long as I have known him.  My sister has never expressed any concerns about it. I am merely curious as to why the dog might do it. Do Bernese dogs have a high pain threshold? Or is it just simply for efficiency's sake, letting gravity do the work? "
1959,Male kitten bullying his sister out of food?,"I have just gotten two cats, and I've never had cats before. My boy (3 months) is  growling? at my girl (4 months). They've always eaten together; with wet food it wasn't a problem, but I'm now putting dry food in the bowl. My boy is acting really aggressive towards the other while eating. I put their food in separate bowls, but my boy is still being a jerk. He eats his food as fast as possible, then goes and tries to take my girl's food. I've tried putting them in other rooms, but my boy doesn't eat until he comes out. I don't know what to do and to be honest, I don't really want to supervise their eating all the time. What should I do? "
1960,Should I get my leopard gecko a Substrate?,"So, I just got a leopard gecko about 4 days ago, its been years since I got one, I already have a good feeding schedule, and he looks happy and healthy, and sometimes lets me hold him.  I was chatting online and someone recommended that you should always get a Substrate rather than the normal soft hair-mesh that comes with the cage.  He specifically recommended coconut substrates, like this one: Zoo Med Eco Earth  So my question is, should I get this for him? Also I have another gecko, under the care of my sibling.  Also if anyone has any extra advice for what to do and what not to do, feel free to post it at the bottom of your answer. "
1961,"What, if any, are the risks to a cat that ingests urushiol?","Cats and dogs do not suffer the allergic reaction to skin contact with urushiol that we humans do.  What about ingestion?  Imagine the following hypothetical1 near-worst-case2 scenario:  A human has walked through a patch of poison ivy, creating direct contact between the leaves of the plant and his shoes.  Further, this human steps in a small pile of rabbit pellets.  A few minutes later, he enters his home and kicks off the shoes.  Thereupon a cat, lured by parfume du bunn&eacute;, licks the shoes.  What health risks are there for said cat?    Footnotes:  1: If you read the edit history of this question, you will note that it is motivated by a real situation involving a very low but non-negligible probability of ingestion.  However, I realized overnight my actual question is about the hypothetical, not the real.  2: Of course, the full-on worst-case is a cat actually eating a poison ivy leaf.  If an answer wishes to address this, go for it, but I think second-hand ingestion as described is more likely. "
1962,Roomba robot vacuum for dealing with cat hair?,"Our cats shed lots of hair, so I spend a significant amount of time with a broom just picking up hair. This literally destroys my back.  So I was thinking of buying one of those robot vacuums that just move around the house, like a Roomba. It looks something like this.  My question: will this actually help? The reason I ask is that my cats are always shedding, so does that mean that the vacuum will always be on and moving from place to place?   What else do you recommend? I also bought a swiffer, but I haven't used it yet. "
1963,How old is too old to rehome a genet kitten?,"I've been researching genets (particularly common and Angolan) as pets. From my understanding once they bond they bond for life and are highly intolerant to home/owner changes. I've also heard that they will get along fine with larger animals (e.g. cats and dogs; anything smaller is a snack) as long as they are raised around those animals.  Now, when looking for kittens, there are various ages, from newborn up to 7 or 8 months (the oldest I've seen).  My question is, when do their bonds primarily form? How old would be considered too old to bring a genet kitten into my home? "
1964,Dog new at the office; should I force walks to stimulate him more?,"I am dogsitting my parents dog for a period of 2 weeks (he is used to staying 1-2 days, 2 weeks is new to him) and he goes with me to the office during the day. He is a 9 year old chichuahua mix, on the 'large' side of the chihuahua scale.  Normally he would go on 2 walks a day and spend the rest of the day around the house, in the garden, interacting with my parents or their cats.   8:00 - A 15-20 min walk 15:00 - A 15-20 min walk   Currently this is our schedule:   8:00 - Garden time for 15 mins 9:00 - 10 min walk 12:00 - 10 min walk 15:30 - 10 min walk 18:00 - 10 min walk  19:00-22:00 as much garden time as he pleases   And ofcourse I play with him during the day whenever he offers me a toy or looks bored to me.   However, he seems to not enjoy the walks at all. He doesn't with my parents and he does so even less in this unknown environment.  Should I wake him during his naps to go for a walk he seems to not really enjoy? Or does him saying no to the walks suggest he is stimulated enough? "
1965,Is a 3-4 Month Puppy Too Young to Start Using a Gentle Leader?,"I have a 14-week old Shepherd mix puppy who definitely pulls on his leash when we walk, but that's as to be expected at this age, so that's actually not why I was thinking about getting him a gentle leader.  He's got a bigger problem of eating literally anything loose on the ground; I'm attempting to train him out of it but that's obviously going to take some time. While that's happening, I was thinking about getting a gentle leader attached to a harness just to gently keep his head up. But I obviously don't want to do anything that would hurt him or cause any future problems so I wanted to see if this was a good idea in general -- and if it's not, if it's something with regards to his young age or not? "
1966,What is wrong with my betta fish? Fin rot? Velvet?,"In the picture submitted you can clearly see a healthy betta fish in the top 3 pictures. Those pictures are from May 2017 when he was first brought home from the pet store. The bottom 3 pictures are from last night.  This is a betta fish. I wasn't aware of the type of care that these fish truly need. I did however do weekly 100% water changes adding conditioner to the water each time. I fed him 2x every day. He was active sometimes but preferred to stay in some artificial plants found in the tank. Last night I changed the water and that's when I noticed something was truly wrong. After I put him in the tank it stayed at the surface and I could see a clear struggle to breathe. Or as you can see in the pictures, it sunk to the bottom and stayed there for a while. I tried feeding it but it would not move. It did not even acknowledge the food. I am ashamed to admit that I have yet to get a kit to test these values so I am unaware.  Currently it is in a 1.5 gallon tank. This tank has been set up since May 14 2017. I do not have a filter. Again, I've been misinformed about the care that these fish need. I read online that if you do weekly 100% water changes you do not need a filter.  There is only 1 fish in the tank. I've had this fish for about 4 months  I have added a new betta hammock last night. Also, I added a heater about a week ago. I also noticed that this new conditioner that I bought has white flakes in it? I have purchased this conditioner before and it did not have white flakes in it.  I know I have failed as a fish owner and I did not realize the damage that I have caused it. I know it is not much but I recently order a new tank and am waiting for it to arrive. "
1967,Couple of same-sex Djungarian hamsters?,"We want to avoid keeping a couple of Djungarian hamsters to prevent breeding. Is it more natural for the animals to keep just one solitary hamster, or two of the same sex? And if two, males or females? In such a case we'd get siblings to reduce possible initial animosity. "
1968,What's the Difference Between Pulling Back on Leash and Stopping?,"There's one thing about leash training that I can't quite wrap my head around regardless of how many of these I read:  If your dog is pulling ahead of you on their leash, the advice is always never to pull back, which makes sense. But does this include just stopping in your tracks? Isn't that automatically creating tension even though I'm not moving/pulling that will still cause him to instinctually pull against?  My puppy definitely walks with the leash pulled tight especially if he sees something and I'd like to have him walk with slack but don't want to stop walking if that's not what I'm supposed to do because it obviously still creates leash tension. "
1969,Cost of keeping a dog vs cat,What will be the average food cost (per month) for having a dog vs cat? How much will vet cost (average) (per year) for a dog vs cat? 
1970,Kitten always gets dirty from stool,"I have approx 3 month old kitten. After poo it usually put hands on the stool and hands get dirty.  It is really annoying because then it roams around and smell is everywhere, is it due to the size of litter box? Does it need more space? The litter box is kind of a tub, round, and triple the length of kitten.  Sometimes I just pick it up as he is done with poo and I put the sand over the poo. Need guidance. It is my first pet. "
1971,What types of kitty litter are there and what else can be used as kitty litter?,What types of kitty litter are there?  What type of materials can be used as kitty litter?   Answering the following question got me searching for some resources on here.  Kitten always gets dirty from stool  I've searched the site here and here to look for this question and cannot find it.  Related: Can desert/beach sand work as an alternative for litter? 
1972,Will my kitten remember me after a day of interaction?,"So I saved a stray kitten (about weeks old, not too sure) from a car that was about to run over her. I was looking for its mother but I wasn't able to find her. It was getting late so (this was probably a bad idea but I really had no idea what to do) I took her to my house and took care of her for a bit. After awhile, the kitten was getting attached to me (I think she thinks I'm her mom?) but unfortunately, I'm unable to keep the kitten until she is months old.   I have someone to take care of it until then. But would the kitten remember me after months? It sounds unlikely but I would really like to know because I'm attached to her and it breaks my heart to be apart from her... "

1974,Should I get my baby cottontail rabbit who is extremely domesticated neutered?,"I know it is very risky to get a rabbit neutered.  My baby is wild but acts very domesticated.   He has his own bedroom and it is right next to my bedroom. He gets loads of attention and lots of handling. I love him very very very much and he knows this. He is given many treats, much talking to, much brushing and very very very much love . He does not spray, he very rarely bites and he allows me to handle him as much as any other rabbit woman. He is extremely loving and friendly and very comical. I don't see a reason to get him neutered since his behavior is wonderful just the way it is.  I am nervous that the risk involved in getting him neutered is not worth it since I have no behavioral problems with him. If I do not have him neutered will this greatly increase his chances of getting cancer?  I know that is that way in dogs and cats because I am very experienced in having all different types of animals and I have my whole life. I believe in neutering all of my animals but I know is extremely risky in neutering rabbits, especially a wild rabbit and I'm not comfortable taking the risk. What are your thoughts?  "
1975,Is second hand exposure to (non-nicotine) vaping harmful to my pet?,"I recently read a blog post on the dangers of vaping around cats. Obviously ingesting the vaping fluid could be a serious emergency, but the post also states:      Additionally, cats living with someone who vapes are exposed to the second-hand aerosols from the vapor that is exhaled into the air. These particles may also settle into household dust. As cats come in contact with the particles, they will ingest them via grooming themselves.   I have friends who use e-cigarettes without nicotine to reduce their dependence on cigarettes (they have the oral habit). I've been told that the exhale of these products is just water vapor. Are there additional cancer causing materials in the vapor that could cause harm to their pets? How much risk is there? "
1976,How do you socialize a bunny that has been locked in a cage for many years with very little socialization?,"My grandma has had an unwanted bunny for about 4 years now. He is very skittish and not friendly because he has never been socialized. I was wondering if there's still hope for him and if he can be socialized so he can be let out of his cage more often and actually be able to enjoy it. Currently, my grandma says she only lets him out when she cleans his cage and she puts him into a hallway that is blocked off with a gate so he can't get out. When he is put into the blocked off hallway he often just sits in the corner regardless of someone is in there with him or not. He also kicks a lot if you try to pick him up to be put back into his cage. Is there anyway we can try to socialize him? Does anyone know any rescues that may take him if we can't? "
1977,Dog charges at other dogs,"I have a Boston terrier, female, 2 years old. We've been socializing her ever since she's been a puppy and she's generally well behaved. She sometimes tends to be stubborn, but is a good dog overall.  However, there is one type of behavior that I would really like to correct with her: when we are outside, leashed or not, and she sees another dog, regardless of the sex, size, or breed, at first she freezes and looks at a dog for about 10 seconds, and then charges like mad (she is really, I mean really, fast dog). If the other dog is big, it let's her come and she usually just runs past it and then makes a full circle only to make another go. But, if the other dog is small or has low confidence, it reads it as an attack and gets defensive, and the dog owner almost always reads it as my dog being aggressive.  It feels like she is super excited when she sees another dog. And whilst this may appear as an cheerful character, it is actually quite burdening. Has anyone had any experience on this subject? How do I explain my dog to take it down a notch? "
1978,What are the ways to help my cats feel better during a heatwave?,"Recently, the majority of UK was hit with heatwaves, and as I am writing this, it's a flaming 90 F/ 32 C. Comparisons aside, it is the hottest it has been in the past few years, for London.  Since yesterday, one of my cats exhibited some behaviour where she would lie down and hug the cool wall, while stretched out. Overall, my cats seem to be slightly affected by the heat, as seen from them constantly lying down stretched out as much as it's possible for them, in shady areas. We don't let them go outside due to living next to an active road.  Last night, my mother gave us wet mini towels to cool our bodies down during the night, so that we can sleep comfortably etc etc (she didn't give the towels to cats, to clarify. We have other family members as well). Today, I came up with an idea to put a moist towel on my cat's belly, while she was 'sunbathing' in front of the window. She seemed very grateful, started purring, nudging my hand with her nose, so I assumed I did a good thing for her. She then fell asleep. She is currently still sleeping.  Is this a good thing if it's not too wet? What other ways are there to help my cats feel more comfortable? "
1979,Cat stopped burying poop in litterbox,"My 15 year old cat, who has arthritis, has stopped burying her poop in the litterbox. Shes had arthritis for a few years and she's always buried her poop but has stopped doing so for a couple of months now. Nothing in her environment has changed, that I'm aware of. We have two other cats who she doesnt care for, but they've been with us for fifteen years as well. Do you know why a cat would stop burying--could it be related to her arthritis, is it something psychological, etc? How can I get her to start burying again?...it stinks! "
1980,How can I stop my black skirt tetras from fighting?,"I bought 2 black skirt tetras along with some other fish for my 10 gallon tank. The next morning one of the tetras died, from stress i think. The other tetra was on its own for about 5-6 hours. Then I added another black skirt tetra into the tank. Now the old one keeps trying to nibble at the new ones fins. He tore a piece off and every time the new one starts swimming around he gets chased by the old one. And now I'm noticing he's started to nip at my other fishes fins. What is the cause of this? How do I stop it? If I take the bully fish out and put him in a different tank for a week or two and put him back in the 10 gallon tank, will it make him less aggressive? Im scared the new one will die soon :(  "
1981,Why do dogs have black eye juice?,"I always wondered; why are the bodily fluids, etc. that accumulate (and usually dry out) in the corners of a dogs (and cats too, I think) eyes black?; but in humans, it is not? "
1982,long-lasting sisal cat tree?,"Need to know if there is a way of making my cat tree/s last longer than 2 months. I did not buy the most expensive one, at £30, but it all but worn away by kitty enjoying her scratching sessions.   Do I need to spend more? or is sisal just sisal regardless of price? I have already trimmed off the shag, the sisal that sticks out that kitty's scratchings have caused, and now comes the time to replace it. "
1983,"Can a dog that has had all his shots for parvo, still contract it?","I have a 1.5 year old Boston terrier who when he was a puppy got all his shots, including 3 for parvo. My roommate recently got a puppy. 10 weeks old? it was sick and when the vet checked he was confirmed for parvo. My dog has been playing with him and sharing toys/water/food with this puppy(possibly even ate his poop) is he at risk for parvo? I'm so scared for my boston. I hope this is the right section.   "
1984,My cat bites my hand mildly after hearing cats in my phone,"One of my two cats called Chilli happened to bite my mother's hand, but it wasn't anything to be concerned about. It was a mild bite. My mother was trying to see how our cats would react after hearing cats meowing in a video on her phone. Chilli came towards her and bit her hand, then left.  Around 2 months after I happened to be doing the same thing as my mother did. I played the same video on my phone that was played two months before, and I got the same result. Chilli bit my hand very lightly and then retreated as soon as the video ended.   What does this mean? Is she not fond of the meowing?  Also, this is the specific video: Link "
1985,How to use Aquarium Substrate Soil,"I recently bough this Soil, as required dirt for aquarium (i don't know how to say in your language that desn't mix with specific kind of dirt, but the thing that root of plant live within). Here are some images:       The seller said it's good foryour plants , and it contains muck(or equivalent), and it help my plants. I have 90WX30dX40h tank, which is filled with semi small and big grit, with height of around 2 or 3 centimeter. small filter inside tank that contains nothing special, soon will add a hanging on small filter, which may fill some part of it with bacterial things(which i don't now about), and remove one sheet of active coil due to that.  Ok back to aquarium soil... first... is this alone enough for aquarium? i didn't find any tutorial, or one that i find and randomly it was also in stackexchange, it used too many special word, which is unknown for me, made it very hard, second, i have very low budget and aquarium stuff are very expensive toward my earning. Ok so the question are: 1. It says for typical 60CM tank (57L) recommanded usage is 8~11, so my tank recommendation should be around 15~20, but the package says it's one litre (first i filled most of the tank with grit and i have low budget), so does this enough for not too many plant (i mean buy providing requirment, not keeping the root of plants)? 2.can it fill the cover the floor(90X30) how many more do i need to reach the need(due low budget), not recommendation?  3.do i need to use any thing else beside it (hope fully non expensive stuff)?  4.does it hurt for fish or snail? 5.where should it be? below or top of grit? 6.it says it help bacteries, but does it provide a place for them to live or i still need other things for that(and again below or on top?) 7.i have two big and a very small air stone, which i put them at the very buttom, and i like to hide them, does they hurt these soil? the package seem to be wet inside and have steam on it.  Here is some photo from my aquarium to specify the grit i used, or filter, or cooling, ...:     "
1986,What is this scabbing and hair loss on my cat's ear?,Hi my cat is about 4 years old now and something that we just recently came to notice is that he has a bit of scabs and peeling/hair loss on one of his ears. Were not sure what it could be but we're really worried. This is the first time I believe this has happened. Could it be something like mites? Mange? He doesnt really scratch at it. It is also not red or inflamed it is just flaking off. If anyone could help me I would be really thankful.  
1987,Are Shiba Inus a good first dog?,"I realize that this question may be a bit open ended, but the follow up question is not.   I have never owned a dog before, but almost everyone I know has one. Until recently I've had no desire to get one until I saw a Shiba Inu a while back. With further research about the breed, I've quickly found out that they cannot be off leash (for the most part), are somewhat independent, and issuing commands to them may be difficult. These seem like deal breakers, but are they?  I want a dog in which will be my buddy instead of getting easily bored, and one in which will not attempt to compete for leader/not listen to me, as they are very intelligent. I've also seen that they are much like cats (one of which I own), and can be independent. The also don't like being touched which may become difficult. Despite the fact that I'd follow all leash laws, it remains that I'd want to have some time with it off to play/fetch. As I live in an apartment building with no enclosed yard, this seems difficult.  With more research I believe that I like Spitz dogs, such as this, this and this, however, many of the dogs I've looked at seem to be difficult to handle. A Canaan for example; I've simply heard many reasons as to why they may not be a good choice as they are very alert like a wild animal.   Are the above reasons deal breakers? Why or why not? Are Shiba Inus a good first dog choice for a male living in an apartment with no backyard?  "
1988,My young cat doesn't like the foster kittens I bring home?,"I have a 7 year old cat and a 1 year old cat. I had fostered before I got the 1 year old and my older cat didn't seem to mind, so we have it another go and agreed to foster a young kitten with a cold. We quarantine her in a separate room from my resident cats. A few days ago, the kitten bolted out of the room and ran down the hall, and was stopped by the one year old cat, who looked spooked by this new thing in the house. Since then, he has not wanted me to touch or pick him up, and he never sleeps on my bed with me like he used to. I love fostering, but I want my resident cat to be happy and loving like he once was. How do I get him back to his old self? Should I introduce them when the kitten is healthy again? "
1989,Why is my new adult male dog compulsively marking and humping the air?,"Background: Got this guy today from a local shelter. A 6 year old un-neutered male teacup chihuahua mix (I think a Jack-chi). Adding him to a household with two other dogs, a 1-2 year old female teacup chihuahua, and a 4 month old male teacup Chi-winnie. All being crate-trained.  The problem:   1) Whenever the new guy is handled, urine leaks out of his penis, he gets an erection, and starts an involuntary-looking humping/masturbating motion. Even petting his back.  2) Whenever he's outside, he compulsively lifts each leg, one after another, urinating until nothing comes out, then keeps on doing it, and keeps on doing it, etc. On a walk around the block he wanted to stop every two feet to do it. And something about it seems involuntary, certainly not aggressive, as he's the most timid little guy.   The two things above really amount to the guy being totally disfunctional. What's going on, and will having him neutered next week fix this?  Note - We haven't had him meet the female yet, though their crates are nearby. We had the two males meet outside the house and surprisingly they got on well. But within a minute, the new guy was lifting his leg dripping everywhere, and then came the erection and the contortions/humping.  EDIT:  Forgot to add this possibly important detail. It seems he's been living the last year at the shelter...underneath the friggin' front desk with a bunch other little dogs. (?!) "
1990,Is it standard procedure for vets to check if a cat is pregnant before spaying?,"Before cats are spayed, owners can choose to have blood-work done to see if the cat can undergo anesthesia. During this blood-work, do veterinarians usually check for the hormone (hCG?) indicating whether the cat is pregnant?  In other words: Is it standard procedure for veterinarians to check if a cat is pregnant before spaying her? "
1991,Am I being jealous over my kitten?,"So, a little backstory first: this is my first pet. I've had dogs growing up and, for whatever reason, whenever we got a new pet it was always my siblings'. Whether it hamster, rat, bird, or puppy, somehow I never was apart of the ""picking out the pet"" process nor naming it- though, as the eldest child, I was always the one taking care of it.  So, I graduated college recently and landed a dream job back in my hometown where my grandparents are located. I had always told myself that once I landed my first ""real job"", I'd get myself my first true pet. I ended up deciding on a gorgeous and adorable Bengal. The adoption period of waiting the 12 weeks for her (to come of 12-weeks of age) was absolute hell in anticipation and but it was definitely worth it.  I've had her for three weeks and she's amazing. We go on car trips together, to the park, I play with her constantly, etc. And of course, other than the money, vet fees, and playing with her at least 2-3 hours a day after work (she has so much energy!), I've spent an earnest 50+ hours from before I had adopted her (in making my decision), waiting for her to come of age, and even once I got her in research. From dieting to play, to psychology and positive reinforcement- I've researched it all to be the best pet-parent possible.  A few days ago, I dropped her off at my grandparents so that they could take care of her while I pack my apartment up. There's going to be a lot of heavy lifting and coming in-and-out of the apartment, so it really wasn't the best place for a playful kitten to be around. Now, I've taken her to the house a few times already so she's familiar with them and my family. I also wanted her to get adjusted because I'm actually going to rent a room from my grandparents because it's mutually beneficial (I save money to pay off school loans and they get a sizable rent check for one room); just for a year or so.  Well, in the few days that I've been away, my grandparents have absolutely fallen in love with her. Which I'm glad! Except... it's been all fine-and-dandy but I'm a bit taken back by some of the things my grandmother has said.   First, let me preface that one should get the stereotype of typical old people out of their mind ASAP. These are young folks who play Pokemon Go, watch my nephew on the daily, and are always out and about. So it's not like they sit at home ""bored"". My grandmother has wanted a pet for YEARS and my grandfather has sternly said no because he didn't want to clean up after it. My cat is okay in his book because it's not his problem (aka mess). Additionally, while my grandmother is the sweetest person I've ever met, she's also very... manipulative? cunning? She convinces my grandfather year after year to spend thousands on new iPads, iPhones, fancy vacations, etc. She get's what she wants and I've seen her pull some shady tactics to do so. A pet is the only thing she's wanted over the years that she hasn't gotten.  So, here's where my story comes in: in the few days that I've been gone, she's sent me tons of texts about how much my grandfather loves the cat and how much bonding time they've had. She's sent me 18 pictures and only one has been of my cat alone. The rest are of my kitten cuddling on my grandfather's bare chest in bed in the morning or my kitten cuddling with my grandmother.  Then today, as my grandparents are leaving for vacation and I'm heading back home, my grandmother and I have this texting conversation:     Grandma: I will miss her. Ha      Me: Yeah, she's such a cuddle bug.      Grandma: She likes to join you when going to the bathroom. Ha.   (I'm thinking in my head uhhhh TMI? I don't want to think of my precious, innocent kitten sitting with my grandma while she takes a dump lol)     Me: Is grandpa all packed yet?      Grandma: Ha yep      Me: He just didn't want to leave the kitty :P      Grandma: Probably. He is pretty smitten by her      Me: Poor guy is gonna have his heart broken when I take move out :P      Grandma: No cause she is staying. Ha ha      Me: Haha nooooope. She was too expensive lol   (As a male, I can't admit that I love her to death so I make a financial joke instead)     Grandma: No, she's our Christmas give from you. ha ha      Me: Maybe I'll get you one of your own but she's mine! lol      Grandma: But we love her!      Me: So do I!      Grandma: But you left her. Ha   (This is where I felt I was either being jealous or sensitive. This isn't a funny joke to me. I left her for a FEW days so I could pack my apartment without my kitten getting hurt/in the way and I had mentioned a few times to my grandmother that I felt so guilty for leaving my kitten and really missed her. ""But you left her"".. I just don't find that funny but actually mean)     Me: Well she goes back in my room when I get back :O      Grandma: We will see... Ha ha   Am I being too sensitive? I feel like she is passively aggressively trying to take my cat or implying that they she wants my cat. I have a feeling this may present issues when I move in, such as them feeding my cat treats whenever or acting like she's theirs. I understand a good argument is ""their house, their rules"" so to suck it up, except I paying good money for rent.  Am I okay feeling like the ""But you left her"" and ""We will see"" line is a bit too much? "
1992,Why would a pet run away?,"A few hours ago Diamond, my pet parrot (Bronze Winged Pionus, nearly 2 years old) bolted out the front door.  I say ""ran away"" because he wasn't lost or spooked, but appears to have deliberately left in a very uncharacteristic action.  I know intelligent pets, of any species, can do that. Cats are nomadic by nature and it's no mystery that one might just feel like moving on. Dogs are territorial and strongly attached to the home and the family. When I was a child my dog sometimes got loose but it's more like she just wanted to stay out or run around more than I did, not ever going away.  My sister had one dog that would get loose at any opportunity but was interested in roaming the neighborhood and was once caught (by the pound dog catcher) next door.  Hey, the fact that a job called ""dog catcher"" even exists is suggestive.  Diamond, a parrot, lives in the house and never goes outside. He tends to keep to a few comfortable areas and doesn't just hang out or explore just anywhere: his habitat in the kitchen, the back of one couch, and a laundry drying rack (also in the kitchen). He'll sit on my shoulder, but doesn't like to join me upstairs in my home office.  He never mooches or grabs food from somewhere even if plainly visible.  But, flying a lap around the connected rooms downstairs is how he indicates that he wants food (or something different from what's already in his dish). I thought maybe it's instinctive in meaning that flying away from a food-depleted area to some fresh ground is a natural meaning to coordinate the flock.  But, he only does that in front of me (or my wife), not whe I'm upstairs. He is getting attention by buzzing us, not getting the urge to go somewhere.  (When we're not downstairs he will call for attention).  So what would posess him to just fly out the door? That is so not like him!  My wife was coming upmthe walk with groceries and I opened it just as she got on the porch. Diamond was in his ""castle"", his primary safe place, and he just up and whoosh.  I thought he must be coming to one of us, but he flew over and past her, not targeting her.  Then I thought he must be just outside, scared of a strange situation: but he was nowhere to be found.  Why would a in-house pet just up and leave, against everything in his usual behavioral patterns? "
1993,How to react to dog on dog violence?,"We have 2 dogs at home: a small 35 lb 6 year-old female hound mix and a 75 lb 4 year-old female pit bull mix. The pit will lash out at the hound so violently that she will force the hound to gasp for air, yelp in pain and often rips away parts of the hound's skin around the neck.  The pit was never mistreated as we got her from a loving home when she was about 6 months old. The hound was a shelter rescue, but has always been very friendly and highly social.  QUESTION  How should my wife and I respond to this? I used to just let it go, but there was frequently blood drawn and I began to fear for the safety of the hound. It's gotten to the point where it is obvious that the pit means to inflict damage to the hound and I have to physically separate them. It usually takes putting the pit in a chokehold, wrapping my legs around her body and putting enough of my body weight on top of her to force her flat and prevent her from being able to rip away the hound.  When she's not being aggressive, she's very playful and sweet. I have noticed that she responds negatively towards the hound upon waking the pit up, the pit being accidentally injured at play - stepping on a foot or tail, if they happen to cross paths near the garbage can, if we pet the pit while she's eating and after she gets verbally scolded.  We are planning on having children soon and are worried about how the pit will respond to a baby. We don't want to give the pit away, but maybe she needs a different environment to thrive?  Sorry for the wall of text, but thanks for your time. "
1994,How do I get my cats to stop being territorial towards my rabbit?,"I've had two indoor cats for years and a few months ago I adopted a Holland lop rabbit. The transition for the cats has been fairly easy because we kept the bunny penned up unless we were around to keep an eye on things. About a week ago, the cats started to misbehave, and I realized that all of the events have been happening around the bunny's pen. They've started peeing in things around the bunny's cage (like their cat bed, my schoolbag, any shoes we keep lying around), and last night when we opened up the bunny's pen I caught one of them trying to use the bunny's litter box.  I know that change is difficult for cats, but we didn't have any problems until about a week ago. The cats haven't acted aggressive towards the rabbit at all (in fact, one of the cats runs away from the bunny), but I think they feel like the bunny is invading their territory which is why they think they need to mark the house around the bunny cage. How can I get them to stop?? I can't keep the rabbit penned up all day, but I don't want the cats to feel like I'm replacing them. Any advice would be appreciated. "
1995,"How to handle a cat's ""bathroom"" needs when confined to a travel crate?","For travel my cat will be confined to a crate for up to 30 hours. I will be able to give him attention, food, and water throughout but likely not able to take him out. How should I handle his digestive/urinary needs? Do I include litter in the crate (though then he is surrounded by it)? Can he hold it that long? Include ""potty pads""? "
1996,Does purring affect my cat's breathing rate?,"Hunter was recently diagnosed with restrictive cardiomyopathy (a heart condition that led to fluid accumulating in his heart and lungs).   We were instructed to monitor his condition by measuring his breathing rate regularly. To do this, we should count the number of breaths (an inhalation and exhalation) that he takes in a minute. We were instructed to do this when he is relaxed or asleep.  When he's relaxed he's usually purring. Does purring affect his breathing rate? Should we only measure his breathing rate when he's not purring? "
1997,Will owls attack small dogs?,"Over the past week I have noticed an owl hunting in our neighborhood at night. I have seen the owl in some of the trees in our yard.  I haven't seen the owl well enough to determine what kind it is, but it looks large while flying and it makes the classic who-whoo-who-whoo sounds when sitting in our trees.  Do I have to worry about it hunting my small (~8 lb) Pomeranian/chihuahua when I let her out at night?   If so, what can I do to deter the owl from coming in our yard and do I need to go out with my dog to protect her? "
1998,What is this clear sticky mucus coming from my leopard gecko's vent?,   There is a clear sticky mucus coming out of my male gecko's vent. It looks a bit like what you see on eggs in females.

1999,Can a baby bird's feathers be dyed?,"I was reading a recent question by a new bird owner whose bird was very colorful when purchased but has become less colorful.  A quick look online shows bird prices can vary greatly by significant amounts, at least partially based on the bird's color.  Can a bird's feathers be dyed? Is there a monetary incentive for breeders to dye baby birds? Would there be any harm to the young bird?  How would a potential new parent tell whether the bird they were considering had been dyed? "
2000,Laser pointer: does a no-win situation risk psychological harm to cats?,"When using a laser pointer to play with the cats, I've always been careful to end the session by giving them a physical toy to play with.  I've assumed, without any actual basis, that putting them in a no-win situation where they could never actually catch the bait would lead to frustration or possibly aggression.  But I've noticed something: my cats are on to this trick, and they love it anyway.  When it's time for play, one of them in particular will run to the table where I keep the laser pointer and look at me expectantly.  He watches me pick it up and turn it on, and he switches between watching the dot and watching my hand.  When the session ends he's become less and less interested in a physical toy to replace the red dot.  Is there anything wrong with pure laser-pointer play?  If I skip the part where I try to transition to a physical toy, am I likely to have behavioral problems later?  The cats are middle-aged indoor-only neutered males.  They also enjoy thing-on-a-string toys but lose interest more quickly than with the laser pointer.  They run away from the battery-powered ball.  All other toys are cat-powered (e.g. batting a toy around the floor). "

2002,"A Kitty fell down to a hole in alley, Please help me with your ideas to get him out!","I was just sitting in my room and my aunt told me there's a kitty cat right on a small hole in the middle of the alley trying to get out but when i went to get him out a car was just passed and it made him fall in there...  I really hurried but the damn car was already passed and the cat was fallen, i looked in the hole with my phone's flashlight and it seems like maybe 6~10meters under ground and i think its dry in there. (but i think its wastewater, i don't know!)  I don't know the right english word for it but there's a door to the ground (!) like a round circle disk... it looks kind of plumbed and clunged, i don't know if these are the right words i'm just searching them from the dictionary!  So what should i do? i really feel bad! I know my aunt should've get him out herself, but ""she's afraid of cats"" ! what's there to be afraid of especially when he's life is in danger!? And trust me, in a city/country where there's no animal control and there are holes in the middle of ground; the 911/fire departement don't care about a cat! so no hopes from them!  Update: I just looked in the hole again with my phone's light and i saw him standing looking at the ground like the how most animal do when they're looking for food i guess! he wasn't that much small but he wasn't an adult cat either.  So now i'm sure that its dry down there and there was some garbage...  Update 2: I called the fire departement and the person who answered said call tommorow morning in daylight we can't come now for such problem and its dark now... (its 12:40 PM here) i just hope he survives it down there and they come tommorow.  Update 3: I called them again and they said this kind of problem isn't something we can do something about! and if you're really feeling bad and pity about him you can try sending a cotton rope in there and when he grabed it pull him up... I think i'm gonna try this!  Update 4: I just used a Laser and a flashlight again and i saw him again so i rushed back in to home and told people to come and see him but when they came he wasn't there! maybe the laser light scared him away! Are they scared of laser light? should i not use the laser again?   I read in an article in wikihow that a laser light (dot) can make a cat on a tree to follow the dot and get out of the tree thats why i used the laser...   Fortunately even though they didn't see the cat it made them believe me and understand the cat is really down there, so my aunt called a pet doctor she knew and he said if you're really sure the cat is down there alive, I know a group that will risk their life to come and save him. I'll keep this topic updated...  Update 5: So two man came and they really looked in the hole with a better flashlight they had and the other one even tied his phone to a wire and wraped it with a tape... and send his phone down there while it was recording and it's flashlight was on, but the recorded video didn't really had a perfect quality (it wasn't bad though, just not perfect) and we didn't see the cat in the video but we saw that it seems like this hole was connected to another one like this was a stair to another level of ground...   But before they came my cousin said he saw the cat! so thankfully there's lower doubts and we know he's still alive. The man tried talking to the cat i don't know how to say this in english, he was like making kissing sounds and stuff like that to make the cat come to us... He said the cat can't grab this rope and we need fabric so we clew some old clothes and send them down there and he said let this be in there so if he sees it he grabs it and climbs up... i'm not gonna sleep tonight to keep checking... wish/pray us luck guys!  Update 6: There is a lot of good and bad news, but i'm really tired now, i'll update here later. just wanted to let you know that i didn't give up! "
2003,Economics of single-parenting a dog (i.e. daycare options),"A few months ago I got an Alaskan Husky puppy with my girlfriend, which we were planning to raise in part as a test of our ability to have a child together.  Unfortunately, things didn't pan out the way we planned. We broke up, and while the ex-girlfriend initially took the puppy with her, after several weeks she determined that she can't keep up with the puppy's energy and the puppy and I get along together way better than she did with it anyway.  I love the puppy to death and there'd be no problem, except that:    I work from 8am - 6pm every weekday My home is small and I do not have a fenced in yard   This is only an issue in terms of daycare -- meaning I have no problem getting her the exercise she needs and whenever I'm not at work I greatly enjoy watching her. However, daycare seems to be an impossible-to-solve issue.  I've been asking around at the dog park and is seems that the major dog daycare facility in my area (which is Baltimore, MD and Columbia, MD) is called ""Stay Pet Resort"". They open early enough and close late enough that it work work for me, and I could get over the extra hour a day I'd spend commuting, however the cost of a monthly pass is [tex]25-30/day and some expect tips.  I have a well-paying job, but with student loans and credit card debit, I can't possibly afford [tex]550 + 6% sales tax * 12 months) out of my post-tax income to go to daycare.  So, my questions are:   Are there more affordable daycare solutions I'm not thinking of, given that I have no family or friends in the area who could help out? Is this a normal/reasonable cost of daycare per month?  "
2004,Is it possible to train dogs to detect Hypoglycemia?,"Is there any evidence that dogs can detect hypoglycemia in humans? If yes, how is that possible?  How is it possible that we can use that ability to train a dog to alert a diabetic when sugar levels are critical? "
2005,Does clipping a cat's claws affect its climbing ability?,"I admit I am against clipping a cat's claws, so I have no experience in the area. Because I don't clip the claws of my cats I naturally have not seen how it affects them. Most of my concern is about the climbing ability of a cat after its claws have been clipped dull. Can a cat climb just as well with clipped claws as with needle sharp claws?    Below is a photo of a climbing tree that has no platforms until the top of the tree. Can a cat climb it easily with clipped claws? How about an outdoors cat climbing a natural tree, which could be more difficult to climb than a sisal-rope coated indoors tree?    "
2006,"Robotic pets included, what options are there for a cubicle pet?","Note: I am intentionally using 'pet' a little bit elastically here.  I'd like to have a preferably furry office pet without cruelty. It would be nice to know I could have a hamster, but that bears at least two obvious objections besides eccentricity: I don't know that one could bring a hamster to work and take it home on the weekends without being cruel to the hamster, and bosses would have a legitimate concern about allergens even if there were not some rule on the books against mammal pets. I've had a Furby 2.0 as an apartment pseudo-pet before discovering uncanny valley effects, and I've kept a tribble and an electronic goldfish, and I know that some places will let you keep fish if you take care of it appropriately.  What are the closest approximations available to keeping something furry as a pet that will not run afoul of animal cruelty or bosses' reasonable concerns about what you bring to the office? "

2012,Can diatomaceous earth be used for flea control on shaved or hairless dogs?,"My understanding of how diatomaceous earth (DE) works is that it's rubbed into the dog's coat. As fleas move through the coat, they come in contact with particles of DE, which pierces their carapaces, causing them to dehydrate and die.  Given that, can DE be used for flea control on shaved (e.g. the Poodle in a Continental clip or Portuguese Water Dog in a lion clip) or hairless (e.g. the Xoloitzcuintli [a.k.a. Mexican Hairless] or Chinese Crested) breeds? If so, how should it be used? "
2013,What are the ideal starting fish populations for this 20-gallon long aquarium?,"My son is going to get an aquarium.    We picked out a 20-gallon, long aquarium (along with some plants and decorations).  I have yet to pick substrate, pump/filter, etc.  I'll be setting it up and taking care of it until he is old enough and responsible enough to maintain it on his own, but we've let him pick out what will go in it.  Fish:    neon tetras fancy guppies cherry barbs golden barbs    Non-Fish   African claw frogs apple snails (for cleaning)   Considering the size of the aquarium, how many of each of the above creatures should I get to start?  Are there general guidelines for starting populations?  It has been many, many years since I've kept an aquarium.  I'm assuming I want more than one of each, since they're all small.  I also recall that the guppies I had as a kid tended to breed pretty fast.  Are there ideal numbers I should shoot for for each creature, in order to keep the fish happy and healthy?  This answer seems to indicate I'll be looking at a maximum of between 10 and 20 total fish (assuming I remember the size of the 4 fish species I listed correctly), but is there a minimum?    Do some of these species do better in larger numbers, and others in smaller groups? Should I start out at small numbers to account for population increase due to breeding? "
2014,Sit/down/stand training: do dogs associate the movement or the final position?,"I'm training my dog the different positions (sit, stand, and down) with an implied ""stay"". That means that when I ask him to sit, he's supposed to stay in that position until I ""release"" him.  For ""sit"" and ""down"", so far so good.  But then I realised that these first steps are easy because in the initial position the dog is usually standing.  I was struggling to train a ""sit"" from a ""down"", then I realised that might be the problem, I added another cue to ""sit from a down"" and he quickly got it.  So the question is: are dogs learning the movement or the final position?  Similarly what about a ""stand"" cue? In my case it means ""stand and stay"". But if the dog is already standing, he just has to stay. Do I risk confusing him by using a single cue?  What is your experience with this? "
2015,"What does it mean to ""overstock"" a fish tank?","""Overstocking"" is a term used when keeping fish.

What does it mean? "
2016,"Is my cat's aggressive behavior playful or mean, and how do I stop it?","My boyfriend and I moved in together a year ago, each bringing one cat.  The older cat moved with me on moving day and the younger one arrived a few days later.  One cat is an eight-year-old female. She's pretty calm and quiet, doesn't like playing so much, and doesn't even climb up the furniture or the tables.  The other cat is a three-year-old male; he likes to play aggressively (biting, scratching, hunting) and is very loud.  We may have presented the cats to each other poorly, as it seems that they simply hate each other.  Both cats are neutered.  The problem is that the younger cat likes to hunt the older one and corner her.  He sometimes slaps her when she's walking near him.  When she's cornered, she starts to hiss and growl.  Frequently, this ""game"" becomes dangerous if I do not stop them.  When I come back home from work, I often see scratches on the noses or eyelids of both cats.  They fight this way several times a day.  We've already tried Feliway (more than once), spray water, and confinement. Nothing works.  It's been a year since this started, and the behavior is the same.  I read ""How to get cats to coexist in peace?"", and tried the suggestions.  When I leave home in the morning, I move each cat to a separate room, with a door separating them.  We've been doing this for two months, and still no success: when we leave them free with minor supervision, they eventually start ""playing"" again.  They have a lot of toys in the house. They have cardboard castles with holes, and I play with them every day, with toys (including a kinder surprise inside egg); we try to give them variety.  I do not know if the younger cat is acting aggressively due to jealousy, a mean streak, or is just simply being playful.  I'm scared because of the scratches, and I fear that any day one of the cats will lose an eye or worse.    How can we handle this situation? "
2017,How to rescue cat from high perch,"I have two cats that can't seem to come down from their high (~20') perches inside a wooden barn.  How can I get them down?  The frame of the barn consists of large (~12x12 inch) vertical and horizontal beams.  The vertical beams are spaced at about four feet.  Over the last few days, they've worked their way up near the top.  I'm not certain they haven't been down, since I have another (ground based) cat running around, but the overall food consumption indicates they have not been eating and their positions haven't changed for over 24 hours now.  Recently, I put boards near their perches that lead to a lower levels.  And I've put food on those boards, about 1-3 feet below their current positions.  My ladders will reach anywhere but I'm afraid I could knock them down if I try to grab them.  I've recently put food about one foot below one of them and about three feet below the other.  Background: I recently adopted/rescued/?? three feral cats from a county sponsored program (chipped/snipped/clipped).  I didn't expect them to be very friendly, but two are terrified of people.  The terrestrial cat is quite social as long as you don't try to touch him.  After the prescribed three weeks in crates in the barn, I released them.  The two immediately started climbing the walls.  The other tries desperately to get stepped on.  Update:  I placed food and water right next to them and they have both eaten a little.  One is looking better and getting around some (still staying 12+ feet up).  The other still seems a little lethargic but has moved to a less precarious position.  I feel like can manage it now.  I think they went about three days without food or water. So in the end, I think both answers I received were important.  I gave them an easy way to get down via boards at a reasonable slope, and I put food right next to them, which I've subsequently moved a little further away.  It may be a while before they get to the ground again, but I think we'll get there eventually.  Another Update: It turns out that the terrestrial cat is quite territorial and would not allow the others near the ground.  Moved him to a different part of the barn and one of the high-up cats started coming down to visit.  But he would chase the other high-up if she came down lower.  It's a mess. "
2018,Are pets sensitive to good music?,"I was wondering, as a cat owner if pets are sensitive to the music we listen to and at which extent?  I noticed more than once that when listening to music on a computer with speakers, my cat approached and stayed close to the speakers. Then I was wondering if it was a coincidence or if he could enjoy what I listen as well as I do. Does it has preferences for some music genres? Can he hate some? Can he recognize some songs? Is it innate or does it have to be ""trained""?  I was wondering about pets in general, but if it's too broad for this site, you can focus on dogs and cats, or even only on cats. "

2020,guppie male harassing females,"Background  I have 2 female guppies in a ~60 L planted aquarium, temperature ~25 deg C, internal filter, relatively hard (but not too hard) water. They've been on a diet of standard flakes. Change about 1/3 water every 1-2 weeks. Until recently they shared the aquarium with a male, all adults. There were another 3 females and another male prior to that. The females were placed into the aquarium about 2 months ago, the males maybe a month after that. One by one fish have been dying. The first to die was a female which looked to have a small white blotch, something I did not notice at the store. Another two females and one of the males died shortly after after losing weight, not always showing clear signs of the culprit disease ( I assume water conditions and food were ok). I don't know the age of the fish, but the females are/were pregnant when purchased.   Question   Despite his small size, the surviving male had been harassing the females, following them and biting them at every opportunity. After the latest casualty of unknown cause I concluded that the stress of being chased may have been a contributing factor to the deterioration of the other fishes health, so I decided to remove the male to another container. Because some of the fish clearly suffered of some disease I presumably cannot blame the male entirely. In addition, I noticed that a fry had been born, and wished to minimize the chance of cannibalism.   What has me a bit puzzled is that now that the females are not engaged in flight behavior, as they are not being chased, they seem to forage more, and I fear that they might instead now cannibalize the fry. This has left me wondering what strategy the male was pursuing in chasing the females? Might the harrasment actually serve to protect the fry? I doubt that this is the males progeny as the females were already pregnant, so I am assuming the male was simply attempting to destroy the pregnant females together with any eggs or fry within, but I am not entirely sure.

2022,Can I get some advice on a good setup for my leopard gecko?,"I got a leopard gecko about 2-3 weeks ago, he seems healthy and happy, he runs about and seems okay.  Im just seeing lots of mixed reviews online about how to take care of them.  Like for example: Some people say the leopard geckos need a UVB light to live (I have a UV Black light already)  And other people say it's un-needed and it makes the vivarium too hot.  Is there a ""perfect"" or atleast ""By the books"" definition and advice page or place where I can be sure Im taking care of my gecko.  Also I usually place my cage next to a window on the back side of my house, where no sunlight shines, just ambient light.  Is this a good thing? Or should I keep the blinds shut. My sister's baby leopard gecko is far from any window or natural area, and he seems to be depressed and unhappy, Constantly hiding in his house, never really coming out, my sis's gecko also fails to eat ANY form of waxworm/mealworm.  Can geckos really ""hate"" some types of food? My sis's gecko has been eating them fine about until a week ago. Now he just eats crickets. "
2023,Is cholla wood safe for a bug terrarium?,"Specifically, is cholla wood safe for a lidded terrarium that will house springtails? . i'm not going to put any vertebrates in there. just springtails, maybe isopods later on. I know cholla is reptile safe, but is it bug-safe? . Context: The terrarium is currently being used to root cuttings from houseplants, it's got potting soil and baby spider plants, philodendron, and pothos. I'm going to be adding springtails as a cleanup crew to help eat dead leaves, since in my experience isopods do a little... too well in my setups (breed like crazy and eat the plants) so i'm just gonna use springtails by themselves.

2024,Resident cat not staying in the house when new kitten is out of safe room,"So, we rescued our cat in February and decided to get a kitten 2 weeks ago. We have done everything the internet suggest and kept them separate. The kitten has his own room and our cat the rest of the house. At first our cat reacted badly to his scent and hated going upstairs where he was shut away. She didn't even come up to bed with us, which was unusual because she loves bed time. Over the course of the week she started coming up and stopped reacting badly to his scent and was instead rubbing her cheeks in our hands and started to come to bed again.   We bought a dog cage to put in our living room to put the kitten in to get the cat used to seeing and hearing him. The first couple of times we only left him in with her (under our supervision) for 15mins- half an hour. At first the cat didnt stop growling the whole time the kitten was in the room. We read online that we should show the cat lots of love when the kitten was in sight but we couldnt as she would start to growl more and hiss at us instead. After a week of doing this she got a bit better and could be in the room without growling unless the kitting started meowing. The kitten started to hate the cage so we got a baby gate and did the same thing but through the baby gate. Things started to look better but now our cat will not stay in the house at all. She will come in at night and come to bed when she knows the kitten is shut in his room. But if we are downstairs, even without the kitten she will not stay in.  We aren't too sure how old our female cat is as she was found as a stray - we estimate around 3-5 and she is neutured. The reason we got a kitten was because we had seen her acting nicely with some cats in the street. We understand that taking it slow and going back steps is good. But we can't even get our cat to stay in the house unless it's bedtime. I also understand that it has only been 2 weeks and these things take time however i am just after further advice to see if there is anything we could do to help her. We have also bought some pheromones one upstairs and one downstairs but they dont seem to do much  Is this normal behaviour? Will she ever accept the kitten? Is there anything else we can try?  "
2025,Seeking advice on managing and adopting a stray cat,"I live with 2 cats in a quiet residential area in Tokyo.  For the past few months, a stray cat keeps coming to our house and I've been feeding him everyday.    He spends most of a day in our backyard lately, and I'm willing to adopt him if he is okay.  However, he seems to be afraid of humans and would never let me touch or even approach him.  He always moves away no matter how slowly and gently I or my wife try, but keeps coming back and watching us and meows as if he actually wants to become a member of our family.   I also want to take him to a vet for inspection before welcoming him, but I'm not sure how it is possible.  Are there any steps should I take?  Should I induce him to come inside the house instead of trying to stroke him first?  I don't want to do anything against his will, but definitely he is interested in us and depending on us (in terms of food and dwelling, at least).  I consider using a trap to capture him as the last resort because it may scare him and deteriorate our relationship.  Any advice in the situation like this? "

2028,Chicken overfeeding therapy for cat?,"My cat keeps craving chicken and human food generally. I thought I'd just cook for more people but I read feeding human food to cats is not healthy long term. I don't have time to prepare well balanced meals for cats.   So I thought maybe I could try out a psychological trick, of overfeeding the cat with chicken until she gets sick of it and maybe willingly goes back to cat food after 2 weeks or so. If, as I read, chicken doesn't contain the nutrient the cats need, her organism probably automatically makes her like cat food (I give her usually wet food) more again?  I read also many people say ""don't spoil the cat"", ""teach the cat this and that"" but I feel bad for her, since I myself also can eat what I want, when I want, and if the cat wants to eat chicken why not give her chicken until she doesn't want it anymore? Nature is wise and if this is not enough, the cat should soon want to eat something else.  Anyone has experience with this? "
2029,"In my multi-dog household, can I expect to be able to take my dogs to the backyard all together?","Background:  I'm currently crate-training and house breaking three chihuahua/chihuahua mixes. And I'm thinking of adding a fourth chihuahua to the new pack-in-the-making. But the only real hang-up is the added time it requires to take each dog to the backyard to relieve itself one by one. Which leads me to my question.  Question:  Once crate-training is more or less at an end, and the dogs have transitioned to being a pack, can I look forward to leading them all to the backyard together to relieve themselves? Or is it that people usually find this to be impossible and end up having to take each dog out individually forever?  Note: I already have a no-play or hangout policy after relieving themselves in the yard...and it's not a place where we play otherwise either. "
2030,Turtle: How do you feed mealworms?,"So I've just come into the ownership of a Mexican wood turtle. It's a long story but normally with something like this I'd do a lot of research prior to accepting the responsibility. In this case I didn't have the chance.  He's around 4 years old  I've been told he's very fussy with eating but loves live mealworms so we have some.  How often should they be fed?  We were given a 'bowl' for him to eat out of however everything I've read online seems to lead to the idea that as a turtle he'll feed in the water; but from what I understand they like to dig and hunt for insects. How should I give him the live meal worms? Should I drop them into his pond for him, or should I place them into the shallow bowl he has and let him have them from there? I'm concerned they may crawl out into the substrate - is this an issue? "
2031,What is this white layer growing in the snail shell's entrance?,My snails have been making a layer of... something(?) around the entrance to their shells.  I don't know what it is.  They remain in their shells until I remove the layer which is really bothering me.  Can someone identify the stuff and tell me how to prevent it? Thanks!  
2032,Most humane way to emergency euthanize an injured cat?,"I really hope I will never have to do this, but today something happened which made me think about it.  I was pulling a jacket out of my backpack, and my big, heavy bicycle lock came with it. It fell to the floor from about 1.5 meter height, and landed right next to my cat's head. The cat got super scared and jumped away, but nothing else happened.  Now, if this lock had hit the cat on the head, or landed on its back, there could be some serious injury. Let's say the cat got mortally injured, but not outright killed, and had to be put down. What would be the most humane way to do euthanize it? Should I put her in the car and drive 30 minutes to the vet? Sounds like a lot of suffering. What if I don't have a car? Or this happens in the evening/night when no vets are open? I don't want my cat to suffer for many hours.  In my area there is an arrangement between vets so there is always at least one vet open at any time of the day, but there were some funding issues with this, so this arrangement could have been shut down.  Sorry for the morbid question, but I would like to be prepared. "
2033,Tips on essentials before I bring my dog hiking?,"I am considering bringing my dog hiking and possibly build it up to camping overnight. Is there any essentials you recommend I should bring other than the obvious water bowls, food, leash, harness and blanket to sleep on? Are little booties, life jackets etc necessary purchases? Has anyone any other useful tips?  Edit: My dog is a husky, german shepherd type mix so he's a big fella, quite excitable and sometimes nervous. He has a very good recall most times.  "
2034,Aqua plants and fish poop,Currently I have an aquarium that has a pebble bottom. Smooth and round pebbles both big and small. I am toying with the idea of introducing live plants to my aquarium. I would like to avoid soil substrate. Will it be possible to grow live plants using just the pebbles?  One of the reasons for considering to have live plants is due to the fish poop that gets in the pebbles. I am hoping that these left over poop after siphoning will become fertilizer for the plants? 
2035,Shiba Inu/Poodle being crate Trained - Can I leave him in the bathroom,"My wife and I have a 3 month old Shiba Inu/Poodle mix. The crate training is rather hit and miss, and that could be because my wife his home with him during the day and he is likely peeing without us realizing it (she keeps as good of an eye on him as she can).  I work a full-time job and my wife is leaving for a week (we will have had him for 2 weeks when she leaves). My plan is to get home over the lunch hour, but it will be about 5 hours on both sides of lunch before he is let out.  He peed in his crate for the first time today as my wife had him in there for about 3 hours to prepare him for next week.  I am wondering how to handle next week.    Should I keep him in the crate even though he may pee in there (and potentially become unhappy with us)? Or should I leave him in a bathroom with his crate, food, water, and some toys in there?   I know if I take option 2 he may have more accidents, but I think it could be less of a shock for him and make the week easier on him. "
2036,How to take care of my dog's teeth?,"My 2 year old dog is starting to have yellow teeth, especially the ones in the back of his jaws. I was wondering, what is the right way to take care of a dog's teeth without overdoing it?   I want my dog to be healthy...not to have a hollywood star's smile or anything. For now I use only dental sticks, but are they enough? Should I wash his teeth and if yes, how regularly? "
2037,Is raw meat a suitable substitute for grain-free dog food?,"I have a 4-year old female Boxer who must be on a grain-free diet as part of a broader treatment of her persistent ear infection. The problem is grain-free dog food is a heck of a lot more expensive than say, beef.  Are there any important precautions I should be aware of before putting her on a raw diet? Obviously I'll be sure to keep things sanitary and not feed her any kind of especially bacteria-ridden meat like cheap stuff or uncooked chicken. Anything else? I don't want to be surprised by something I did woefully wrong (or didn't do).  Secondly, how much of other things like vegetables should I use to supplement the meat? It just seems like a ton of fat and protein, which I guess is good, but what specifically would she be missing, and how much of it would be necessary to balance her diet?  Lastly, I've been told two different things. The first is to withhold any food for 24 hours before putting her on a raw diet (which really doesn't make sense to me), and the second is to gradually work it into her normal diet before eventually letting it take over (which makes more sense but I've heard more of the former than the latter).  Any help would be much appreciated. "
2038,"Am I feeding my rabbits a balanced diet? If not, how to get there?","Does feeding need to be corrected? And in which direction(s)?  Where I am now:  I have two rabbits born end of Feb 2016. Siblings, one male (castrated) and one female. They are both small for their age. I got them from a rescue place. The person I got them from said they have a genetic defect whereby they will grow slowly.  During the first few weeks I owned them I learned the muesli style pellets (muesli plus pellets) was not good for them, so I weaned them onto 100% pellets in a week. No problems there.  For the rabbits I provide the following daily amounts combined (not each).  Approx equal volumes of hay and greens. Total volume approx the same as the volume of the rabbits.  The greens comprise approximately equal amounts of nettles, young blackberry runners and dandelion leaves with some white clover in lesser amounts. Once a week I’ll go to the nearby fields and collect a large bag of these, mix them up and store them in the fridge.  70g pellets (recently increased from half that amount). Pellets are Vitakraft Emotion - I just realised these are for dwarf rabbits.  4 blackberries - either fresh off the bush, else from the freezer as I froze this year´s glut of blackberries.  1 tablespoon ripe nectarine or apple - fresh or frozen.  A small cucumber cut into 4 pieces lengthwise (usually about 10cm long, diameter 3 - 4cm).  Occasional amounts of any of celery leaves and stalks, lemon basil, peppermint, broccoli leaves, radish tops (all taken from our garden).  They have a 7 square metre circular run I improvised by wrapping 10m of chicken wire round the garden trampoline. It provides both space and shade. I used to move food from their hay rack in their main hutch to this play area, but I have stopped that now. I want them to eat the grass. They will eat grass. But not much during the day. They seem to like grass more if I pull a few strands and feed them through the chicken wire.  They don´t seem to be addicted to the pellets. That is, they will nibble on them and move on but they are usually eaten in 24 hours.  They will eat everything, but the hay only sparingly. So that means everything I give them is eaten, except the hay. I drop in some food in the morning around 07:30, and replenish in the evening, 19:00 to 20:00. In the morning they seem hungry, and know they are going to get their breakfast, but overnight they only eat the greens.  I have tried hay I made myself from fresh meadow plants (which I think is superior to anything I have bought, but only because it is still green :P ), nameless hay from the local supermarket, and I just took delivery of some Timothy Hay, “meadow hay” and also some dried dandelion leaves (intended as a reserve for the winter, provided they eat these).  So far I have given them only the Timothy hay, and they didn't seem to be impressed by it.  Where do I need to be?  Are they getting enough fibre from the greens I am giving them? But what about winter when there are no fresh greens like this?  Enough protein, minerals and vitamins?  How can I get them to eat more hay? "
2039,Why is not possible to make serology exam in animal's blood with hemolysis?,"I am not from the medical area but I am struggling with a trouble with my pets and it seems that no veterinary here in my city know how to explain this to me. I have two cats and I need to make an internacional travel with them. To accomplish this, I need to make serology exam on them. But, something is happening with the blood because is happening hemolysis after taking it off.  Though I have made some researchs about why hemolysis happens and none of them convince me at all, my question is: why serology can not be made with a tiny hemolisys in blood? I have took the blood of my cat three times to prove she does not have anger disease and lab (the unique in Brazil which is allowed to make this) is saying they cannot make the exame because the blood had a really really tiny hemolysis. Is this truth or it is only burocracy? (I already have heard this theory)  Thanks for helping me. "
2040,Are Cavalier-Poodle able to run over 2km?,"My wife and I are thinking about adopting a 2.5 year old cavapoo (50% Cavalier- 50% miniature Poodle 8.5kg).  Scenario  I have a very large office at work and am thinking I could take the dog with me to work everyday. I work at 2km from home and am biking everyday on concrete path that would be safe for a dog to run next to the bike (except if the concrete would hurt the dog's paws). The trip is mainly flat and I take about 4-5 minutes to make it but I realize I will have to slow down for the dog. Intuitively, I'd think that such a trip would be too enduring for such a relatively small dog but I might be mistaken as I have little experience with dogs (and even less with small dogs).  Question   Is an adult cavapoo able to run over 2km on concrete twice a day? How much time would it take to a cavapoo to run over 2km? I live at Vancouver, BC. The temperature does not get too high but the winter is very rainy. Will the dog be happy to run under the rain?   I could also take the cavapoo in a bucket in the morning and allow it to run on the way back in the evening, or systematically take the cavapoo in the bucket for half the trip. Does one of these alternative sounds like a better idea? "
2041,Getting a cat - advice for working people,"My girlfriend and I both work, but are considering getting a cat. I'm wondering if this is acceptable and if there are any specific considerations that need to be made for the welfare of the cat.  Reading online, I have seen that some breeds aren't well suited to this and some cats may be better off in pairs to give them a friend for during the day when everyone is out at work.  We have a small house and can give access to the garden/outside.  What do I need to consider? Is there anything I need to do or anything I should avoid getting/doing? "
2042,"Training a dog to ""sit pretty""","How would you proceed to obtain a nice ""sit pretty"" from your dog?  Clicker training is about clicking the right ""approximations"" at the right moment.  So what would be the sequence of approximations that one should aim at?  I imagine that starting from a sit and using a target (I use a stick with a cat-toy ball) is a good start, then clicking for the two front paws off the ground ? "
2043,Why would my cat seem to prefer 'liquid' food?,My cat does like his wet food but seems to particularly enjoy the liquid part of the food. He'll lick all of the jelly or gravy from the food first before eating any of the meat or fish chunks and sometimes will leave quite a lot of the meat behind but never leaves any liquid or jelly. Has anyone else found this with their cat?  Perhaps this is because he gets unlimited amounts of dry food too and needs a fair amount of liquid to compensate. He does have a water fountain with a pump and filter which gets emptied out and refilled every few days which he seems to use regularly too. I don't see any signs that he's overweight or overeating.  Why would my cat seem to prefer the liquid from 'wet' cat food? 
2044,Are blank pet passports available outside of the EU?,In Europe vaccination history and pertaining information about your pet are collected in his pet passport. Now we moved away from Europe and are about to get another pet (in addition to the ones we brought with us).   The problem is: The EU only sells passports to veterinary doctors (even though the passports apparently serve no other purpose than the person's convenience). But collecting vaccination information in the form of loose sheets of paper is ridiculous! Let alone the fact that the microchip info etc. is missing.   So my question is:   Can I order pet passports online?  I don't care if it's made in China and is a fake.  Click here if you don't know what I'm talking about. 
2045,Why do animals try to stay awake when they need sleep?,I found a video on YouTube of animals drifting off and trying to stay awake (by jerking their heads etc. like humans do). Why do they do this instead of just letting themselves fall asleep?  
2046,What qualities are essential for a Search And Rescue dog?,"I've been watching some documentary and these dogs are of course super impressive.  So these dogs obviously must have some good physical capabilities and are very well trained, over many years.  At the same time it seems that rescue dogs are often selected, trained and given to emergency response teams.  On what basis are they selected? What are the essential qualities they should possess? "
2047,Foster dog suddenly violent,"We took a foster dog 4 days ago and he's been a bit depressed, not eating nearly enough, no matter what food we give him, but all in all he is very calm and quiet. He's trained and does tricks, not violent even to cats. Slowly he's started to play with us and get close to us.  Hes a mixed shepherd, about 40 kilos, 4 years old and was taken to the dog house a few days before we started to foster him.  Today we took him to a coffee hose (no the first time) and people came up to pet him (not the first time either) and suddenly out of nowhere he attacked them in a violent way we've never seen before. No damage was done but he bit the guy's pant's and made a little bit of a scene.  A few questions:   Any idea why this might happen? Are we to expect more reactions like this out of nowhere? How to react to this behavior Can we see this coming? More importantly - we were considering adopting him after the foster time is over and we're having second thoughts, is there any way we can know if he is dangerous to us?   Right now we're a bit scared of him, not because of the reaction itself but because it was so sudden and unexpected. "
2048,How to carry or transport a pet parrot in Indian Railway,"I have three parrots, I have to move to another state. How can I carry parrots in Indian Railway?  Specifically, which type of cage or food is required, or else what do I have to do. How can I care for my parrots (physically and mentally) during the journey?  Note: I asked about the procedure, which documents are required (I heard that I had to get a certificate from the High Court), and things like that at Travel.SE.  "
2049,Why do dogs and cats eyes reflect light? Does bright light affect their vision?,At night when the light is pointed towards dogs and cats their eyes give a gleaming effect (greenish light). It even happens during a flash of a camera. I've seen this on a cat and the dog and afterward both stared for a while.  I don't flash lights into my animal's eye on purpose but while finding my way in darkness I need to watch my step. Even when the light falls on their eye they do not turn away or move their head other way they simply stare on. Is it disturbing for them to have the light shine on their eyes? Does this have any effect on their vision or its just a temporary effect which fades (as in humans vision when exposed to a flash)? 
2050,"Is it safe to take a small (such as a robo or chinese) hamster in airplane, or can they ""explode""?","I am planning to fly from USA to Hong Kong and wanted to take my small chinese hamster with me. My understanding is that a hamster would probably have to ride in the cargo hold with other animals (dogs etc).  But I was told by a friend that very small animals like the chinese or Roborovski hamsters are unable to deal with the cabin pressure (or lack thereof) in airplanes. What that friend told me made it look like as if the hamster might explode.   This sounds like an urban myth to me but is it correct? Is it safe to take hamsters on an airplane, or should I instead try to find someone to take care of it here while I am abroad? "
2051,Dog obedience scent discrimination,"I've been watching this video from Cruft 2015 , that's a demo from obedience winners.  If you fast forward to ~10' there's the scent discrimination exercice.  It seems that the correct cloths have a red mark on them. Is it always the case? Won't the dog just pick that one all the time then?  Edit: again in this video where the correct cloth is clearly different from the others. "
2052,how can I tell if my silver shark is pregnant,"I have two silver sharks in my aquarium. Today I noticed that one seems to have a couple of bumps on its under belly (see pic) also is hiding at the back of the tank, but usually swims around in the open area. How can I confirm if this is pregnancy/carrying eggs (sorry I'm not sure of the biology on this), or something wrong with the fish? Also if pregnant what steps should I take next?  Shark1 not pregnant Shark2 possibly pregnant Shark2 possibly pregnant "
2053,Red flesh coming out my turtle's tail,"I have two turtles in one tank. One of these turtle, day before yesterday got red flesh coming out of its tail, other one was pulling it out.   I removed the hurt turtle from the aquarium and put it in a tub.Its perhaps its dick coming out of its tail, I saw here [website]Since turtle's dick (not sure it is dick)it has stopped eating and dick is also not going back. I am so worried, dont know what to do?  Here are few pics, showing how it looks:    "
2054,"Sit and down at a distance, should I ask someone to be my ""assistant""?","Clicker training and positive reinforcement are my way to go and I think I have a proper understanding of these principles.  However, it is very rare to see tutorials, videos or live training with two people, one being the ""trainer"", the other one being the ""assistant"".  So for example, would we benefit from that while training for sit/down/up/etc. at a distance?  I can imagine letting my dog sniff around while someone keeps him on a loose leash, then I call his name, get his attention and ask him to sit. My dog will most probably come towards me before sitting. Then having someone next to him to prevent him from doing so could be a nice help. I would do that with a dog that already good training with sit/stay at a distance, so that the assistant would just need some gentle leash pressure to stop the dog and wait until he sits.  Does anyone have experience with that? Could it be a real plus or do you have argument why this is a better way? "
2055,Should we crate our puppy during their first car ride?,"If a puppy has yet to be introduced to a crate, is it more stressful to crate the dog (and thus possibly create a bad association with the crate) or should we try some other method of transporting the pup during his/her first ride home?   I was thinking I could possibly sit in the back of the car and hold the pup on my lap by the collar while petting and soothing the pup, but this seems a recipe for disaster.  Should we just toss a treat (puppy kong?) in the crate and hope for the best? Or is there a way I haven't thought of? The ride should be a mere hour to ninety minutes, depending on traffic.  "
2056,What if a cat seems annoyed by her whiskers?,"My cat has long whiskers. And she constantly rubs those whiskers on things, like they itch.  I read up a bit, and it says that's just their way of declaring ownership with scent glands and such.  Okay, case closed.  Except it really seems like she's frustrated with the sides of her face.  And if you physically grab her whiskers and just kind of pull on them, she seems more satisfied than annoyed.  Like she's happy you're pulling on them, and if you rub the base of the whiskers she seems even happier.  As a human who finds beards being itchy and wanting to shave, I am wondering about her point of view.  I've read about trimming whiskers being cruel because cats want to use them for knowing how wide their bodies are etc.  But she is clearly having issues with it and I can literally tug on the whiskers and she seems more relieved than annoyed.  Is there any record of overlong whiskers actually annoying a cat?  Has a cat ever seemed happier after a whisker trimming?  The cat hates nail clippings too, but foregoing that meant she cut up her ear scratching it.  Is there something foundational about whiskers where it is not something you should ever worry about because ""they are supposed to be as long as they are due to cat science"" ? "
2057,Why does my Maine Coon dig around his water before drinking?,My Maine Coon digs around his water dish before drinking. Is this something that's common with  Maine Coons?   Why does he do this? 
2058,Alternatives to neutering a male cat,"Our male British Shorthair is a bit over 4 months and reaching the age we should consider neutering him if we want to avoid spraying and other side-effects of him sexually maturing.   Still, as a young cat he is very mild tempered, and always stays indoors in a spacious apartment on a high floor.   Is there any chance to avoid the annoying parts of sexual maturity without neutering him? Can perhaps the fact that he will not be coming in contact with other cats prevent him from marking his territory by spraying? And what about developing aggressiveness when he is in heat?  And are there any (perhaps pharmaceutical) alternatives to surgical neutering? "
2059,Rabies from a cat? Under what circumstances?,"In the country where I live there has been a mild rabies outbreak, which in turn has prompted the authorities to enforce obligatory vaccination of all cats and dogs, even ones which don't go out. It's an issue that (according to my vet) may put the cat's life in danger since the spot of the rabies vaccine has a higher possibility of developing a tumor in the future.  Of course a cat can (even playfully) bite or scratch you, but is there a real danger from that? And how can a cat kept inside contact rabies? Is rabies possible to be contacted by the cat even without being bitten or scratched by another ill animal e.g. by contacting bat feces? "
2060,Why should I take a cat to a vet for regular check-ups?,"Cats are healthy animals in general, aren't they? Now I just noticed ""regular vet check-ups"" mentioned twice (only twice - I searched) here in Pets. (link, link)  So far I've taken our cats to a vet only for their vaccination(s) and de-sexing ops, or if there is a health issue at hand. This means a visit to a vet once every two or three years, depending on the vaccination renewal period. That does not sound like what is meant with ""regular check-ups"", which sounds like twice a year at least, if you ask me.  Why should I take a cat to a vet for a check-up, if I don't notice anything amiss with the cat? "
2061,My cat has started licking paper; what does this mean?,"One of my cats (the one who needs to be discouraged from biting, in fact) has, in the last few days, started licking papers that he finds around the house (mostly on my desk).  He last saw the vet two months ago and all was in order then, and I haven't observed any other behavior changes or suspicious symptoms.  We've made no (known) changes in his environment (indoor cat) or diet.  He has toys to chew and otherwise play with (that he likes), and I try to make sure he gets enough interactive play time.  He's not chewing on the paper, just licking it.  He seems to prefer photocopies and laser-printed pages to other sorts, and has shown no interest in newsprint, magazines, or books.  What might be prompting this new behavior?  Or is it just that cats are weird sometimes and he's just going through a phase -- spring is in the air, or something like that?    Update: six months later he still does this (and I stop him when I see him doing it), so it wasn't just something seasonal.  He's been to the vet since I asked this question and the vet found no problems in his mouth or his bloodwork.  It is possible that he only does this when I'm around (I wouldn't know, not having a cat-cam); I now wonder if it's a weird way of demanding attention.  (Male, neutered, indoor-only, estimated age 6-7.) "
2062,"My Maine Coon sometimes vomits hair-balls, should I be concerned?","From time to time we come back home and we find rather disgusting hair-balls vomited by our Maine Coon.  From what I read these are hair-balls and it might be normal that the cat vomits them. However I don't know if at some point I have to worry.   The cat has to eliminate the hair-balls. Is it normal to vomit them? Does an increase in frequency means that something else is wrong, like a change in the food? What can I do to prevent these vomits? (annoying for the cat I assume)  "
2063,Allergies to cats developing after six months?,"I recently gave away our one year old Persian male cat after keeping it for 10 months. After 8 months of keeping our cat, my wife developed asthmatic symptoms, but since we gave the cat away my wife is fine.  Was it the cat or something else? Or is it possible to have such symptoms after 8 months of keeping cat?  And secondly, is there a possibility she will have same problem if we keep a dog? "
2064,What live plants are safe to plant in a vivarium with an Emerald Swift?,"I recently bought an Emerald Swift, and want to add some live plants to his vivarium. What live plants are safe for me to put in there with him? He's an obligate carnivore, so I can't imagine that he'd really nibble on any of the plants, but are there some plants that I shouldn't put in with him?    Here he is looking grumpy:   "
2065,Is there anything special I have to do for a skinny pig?,"As a kid, I had many many guinea pigs. I loved them, they were cute, and fun, and relatively easy for me to take care of. I was considering getting another one now that I am an adult, and then I saw skinny pigs. From what I can tell, they are a lot like guinea pigs, but hairless.     Keeping that in mind - if I decide that this is the pet I want, is their care the same as the average guinea pig? The person at the pet shop said that it was, but I know sometimes that people at pet stores don't know everything about every animal, so I wanted to make sure I was best prepared before I took on a new pet.   Do I have to do anything differently with a skinny pig than I would with a normal guinea pig? "
2066,Why do my cats twitch when they're sleeping?,"When both of my cats sleep they start to twitch, all over their bodies. their paws/toes, ears, whiskers, tail, even their sides will all twitch as they sleep. It's cute because it looks like they're dreaming about catching a mouse or something, but it seems detrimental for actually getting rest. They don't do it all the time while they're asleep. More so when they first fall asleep, then off and on while they continue to sleep.  I know it's normal for humans to move around in there sleep, rolling over to a more comfortable position and things like that. But this seems almost too violent of movements to be constructive to getting a good night's sleep. So why do they do this? Are they dreaming? "
2067,How do I keep my neighbor's cat from defecating in my yard?,"One of my neighbors (not sure which one) has a cat that keeps defecating in my yard, I keep finding remnants every other day.  While amusing, I don't have time to build the motion activated scare machines depicted in these videos     How to stop cats pissing on your car How to stop cats forever   However, commercial, and home made scented products seem to have mixed reviews:   shake away liquid fence citrus sent   Further, it seems that using a low voltage electric fence to deter cats and dogs is not allowed in the US.  What cat deterrents actually work? Are there other ways to keep a cat from defecating all over my yard?    Related: How can I keep my neighbor&#39;s dogs out of my yard? "
2068,Why is it not common for cats to be taken for walks?,"I often see people out walking their dog to get them exercise and fresh air. However, I have never noticed someone taking their cat for a walk, although I have seen cat harnesses and leashes for outdoor activities with felines.   Why is it less common for cats to be taken outside for walks? Don't they need exercise and fresh air, too, (especially when they're young and hyper and active) or do they get enough indoor play-time? "
2069,What should I consider before allowing my pet to be a blood donor?,"I searched for pet blood donation online and found there are several organizations.  I don't have any numbers, put there are potentially hundreds in the USA.  Looking at few sites, it appears there is no 'standard', this claim by one organization The only veterinary blood bank licensed by the USDA and the California Dept. of Food and Agriculture. We are inspected and approved for shipping by the Canadian Ministry of Agriculture. implies there are significant differences in quality across the available organizations.  So if I was considering allowing my pet to be a blood donor, what should I look for or consider before allowing them to participate?    If I have more than one emergency vet to choose from, what kind of questions should I ask about the source of their blood supply, while doing my pre-emergency research?  "
2070,Why do some cat's behaviors change when there's a full-moon?,"I've been living with several cats for many years. All of them are lovely and good natured. But I observed some very interesting thing; two of them really change their behavior during the full-moon phase. All routine behaviours change, they start to fight with each other, and start to scream insanely all day long, without any reason.  Are there any studies, or has there been research done about this weird and interesting circumstance? Is there a link between the full-moon, cats, and the term ""lunatic""? "
2071,Are rawhide bones or natural raw bones potentially dangerous for a dog?,"Chewing can be a very rewarding activity for dogs and it also provides mental stimulation and helps clean their teeth. So I'm planning to give a bone to my dog from time to time, to keep him busy, but what is the better choice?  I've read this question Are chicken bones dangerous for dogs? where this answer discusses the dangers of cooked bones. So cooked bones are out.  That leaves two choices: rawhide bones or natural raw bones. We can also distinguish between the regular rawhide bones and the pressed rawhide bones.  Can they be dangerous for the dog? Is one choice better than the other one? Should I avoid bones altogether and use rubber chew toys? "
2072,How can I get rid of a goldfish,"A few weeks ago my wife rescued a goldfish from a public fountain. We put it in a fishtank lended by our neighbors then we installed a filter and some decorations.  The thing is that :   after a few days the kids lost interest, I'm not sure the tank is big enough for the fish (16 liters)  I don't like cleaning the tank so I ""will do it tomorrow"" and the poor guy basically lives in yellow / green water   How can I get rid of it? Can I put it in a river?  Thank you.  Edit  Thank you for your answers!  Just to be clear : I asked this question to avoid any kind of animal abuse of course.  By chance, my aunt installed a pond in her garden yesterday. She agreed to take my fish and plans to add more of them in the next days.  Edit 2  Ok it's done : I gave the fish to my aunt. She decided not to put it in her new pond but in an other one she had before but I didn't know. It's 100 times bigger than my tank, there is vegetation and other fishes. There is a filtration system and oxygenation system. The water is super clear. Some of the fishes in there are 15 years old so I think the little guy will be alright. "
2073,Why does my cat LOVE coconut oil?,Just curious if anyone understand why my cat seems to go crazy for coconut oil?   Do they have different ways of perceiving taste than us?  I have tasted the coconut oil and the flavor is very mild. I don't understand why he likes it so much. 
2074,Why is my dog very weak and having difficulty to move?,My dog has been with us for 14 years. He's not a pure breed but probably around 3 feet long.   I woke him up yesterday to give him some food. And he could not stand up properly to eat the food. He tried his best and his legs were just weak and wobbly until he started panicking and howling but still unable to stand. After 20 mins of eating he calmed down and was able to stand. But he's having a hard time walking and a little wobbly. Is this a nerve issue or muscle issue? Can it be supplemented with vitamins? 
2075,What percent of cats are 'lap cats'?,My male ginger tabby cat just loves to come curl and sleep on my lap while I work on my desktop which is heart-warming most of the time.  But I've read that many cats prefer to stay/sleep at a certain distance from their owners. So I'm wondering how common is this lap-loving behavior among cats? Is it more prevalent among certain cat breeds?  
2076,Possible trip away from home for 7-10 days - 3 cats in household - cat sitter or cattery? What to look out for?,"I have 3 'mature' cats (age 7, 7 (littermates) and 12). All get on fine and often hang out and nap together, eat together happily, use the same litter boxes etc.  We have been taking a few overnight trips and leaving the cats at home overnight with enough supply of food, water etc. We remotely monitor the house with smart cameras to make sure everything is ok. While away the cats don't seem upset in any way, in fact they seem to enjoy the napping time and eating whenever they want - although they are pleased to see us when we get back!  I did once take a trip of about 4 days and had a neighbour drop in twice a day, which went ok but I don't want to impose on neighbours for much longer than that as that's a bit cheeky! (And the neighbour isn't really a cat person!)  Now we are potentially planning a trip away from home for around 7-10 days.  The options seem to be to book the 3 into a cattery or to get a cat sitter (we don't have a suitable person nearby who we could rely on to come by daily or twice a day).  Which do you think is a better option? To book the cats into a cattery or get a cat sitter to visit them at home?  Here's what I have thought of so far:   Cat sitter - stay in familiar surroundings but potentially left alone for much more time in total. Cattery - secure environment, no chance to 'run away' thinking that we are not coming back, more interaction? - unfamiliar environment.   What should I look for in a cat sitter or cattery? (e.g. some of them send photos and updates via WhatsApp or similar which I like the sound of!) "
2077,Hens and no rooster : What happen to hen and their unfertilized eggs?,"I looked for the answer but didn't manage to get clear informations.  If I have a bunch of hens, but no rooster, hens will lay unfertilized eggs (AFAIK).  From what I read, hens will brood them anyway, but then what ??   How long ? Will they notice at some point that the eggs is not going to hatch/gets rotten ? Will they die brooding ""for nothing"" at some point ?   Eggs will rot at some point, what happen to the hen then ?  My main question is :  1) What happen to the hens and to the eggs if I don't pick the unfertilized eggs ?  2) What happen to the hen if I do pick some eggs, but not all of them ?   3) What happen to the hen if I do pick every single egg ?   2) and 3) are kind of related to 1), I can ask other questions if necessary, but I think it's close enough so that one answer can cover every scenario. "
2078,How clean are pets?,"I am troubled and afraid of pets because of hygiene reasons but almost everyone is telling me I should not consider hygiene as a reason to avoid them and be appalled.  I am a person that loves hygiene. I dislike and avoid physical contact with humans when dirty and/or sweaty.  How clean are pets by human hygiene and human medicine standards? Can a human not allergic to them get moderately sick because of contact with their dirt, mud or anything else they bring in?  I have had my fair share of health burdens.  I am a cancer patient (Pilomyxoid Astrocytoma in the Pons of the Brainstem, I have right eye extremely blurry vision after scaring of a corneal ulcer due to sterile, exposure,friction ceratitis(corneopathy) because my right lacrimal gland does not produce tears. Right sided absolute cofosis. And paresis or paralysis of several nerves. My left side vision and hearing are not that much affected. I have complex partial epilepsy due to cancer.  My Question is:  How clean are pets by human hygiene standards? "
2079,How to stop my cat from urinating on the new carpet?,"My kitty is 12 years old. He's indoor/outdoor. We moved a couple months ago and now either the door is left open so he can come and go freely, or he's trapped inside. He hasn't tried to get me to open a door at this place, he either goes out if it's open or seems content to stay in...except this.  He has never had issues using the litter box. Even if I forget to clean it for a few days, he's never urinated outside of it.  I bought a new shag like carpet for the living room. It's beautiful. It adds color, my toddler loves it, it's soft...and my cat wants to pee on it. Not a specific corner, he's tried all over it (it's 5' x 7'). He looks right at me and squats down. I've only not stopped him once. I haven't seen him use the litter box since I first caught him, but there aren't other random places being used and it's not somewhere I would know for sure (I have two cats so it's been used but could just be my other kitty who I have seen). He hasn't tried to urinate on the carpet when the door is open to the outside, only when he's trapped in, but it's getting colder and I can't leave it open forever soon.   I took him to the vet - no medical issues they could find.   I don't want to get rid of this carpet. I love my cat more obviously but I also can't have him urinating in the middle of the living room where my two year old plays.   Is it the texture? We've never had a shaggy carpet before. Is there a way to get him to stop? Do I just need to give up my beautiful rug? "
2080,Is cheap human food for street dogs good for their health?,"I live in a place where there are lots of stray dogs. The number is quite high. I try to feed most of them but they are a lot in number. I'm a minor and do not earn much, so I feed them some cheap food but it's not at all bad food and it's only one thing most of the time, biscuits. They can hardly get hold of food like this.  I have some friends that help but they are also minors and cannot afford quality food because their parents and ours don't agree. It's okay. They help us to get doctors when there's a serious problem but not for everyday food.  Ingredients of that particular biscuit:    Sugar Salt Invert Sugar Syrup Edible vegetable oil IN 223 (Dough Conditioner) Wheat flour Baking soda Milk solids Emulsifier (diacetyl tartaric acid, IN 472 esters of mono and diglycerides of edible vegetable oils) Raising agent IN 503(ii) (Ammonium hydrogen carbonate)   We collect money and buy these biscuits in bulk.  There's been a rumor going around too that these things damage the dog's liver system. I don't know if that's true or not.  Is this harmful for them? If it is then what should I switch to which can be cheap? (not asking to recommend the food, not the actual question but just a hint can be very helpful) "
2081,What could I feed a dog if my budget is small?,"After reading this question: Is cheap human food for street dogs good for their health?   I thinking about cheap foods for dogs (for example stray dogs one wants to support), if one does not have the budget to buy common dog food.  Which foods could I serve a dog, if the aim is to feed very cheaply and as healthy as possible? "
2082,Two pet cats suddenly fight,"I have had two cats, 4 years old, that I raised from kittens. One boy, one girl. They've tolerated each other and can sometimes be seen sitting on the same perch together. They have their moments of ""UGH I hate you!"" and bat at each other and yell, but what they did this morning was so different.   They puffed up, screamed, and fought light two absolutely feral cats on the street. I had to leave for work, but I'm not convinced I'll be going home to living cats.   Could a feral animal outside set one cat off? My girl cat was at the window when I heard the commotion. I went over to check it out and she had flown into a fit which, I assume, made my boy cat panic and then they went at it. I was definitely caught in the cross fire trying to pull them apart. I was definitely panicking, which I know doesn't help the situation, but I wasn't sure what to do. By the time I left for work, they were under different pieces of furniture yelling and hissing at each other.   I spoke to them calmly and could pet the boy cat, but the girl cat was still completely nuts. They were both wholly different cats I'd never seen before. I've seen cats fight. I've seen my cats fight. I have never seen aggression like this ever.   What would have caused this? Will they get over it? Is there anything I can do to help mitigate cat fights like this, without sacrificing my own skin? Would it be best to leave them alone for the day to figure things out?  "
2083,Goldendoodle puppy outsmarting us for going outside / coming in?,"Background  So we have a Goldendoodle that is about 8 months old now and has learned many things so far. She knows that if she goes to our side door, we will open it, and she gets to go to our fenced in yard to goto the bathroom.  When she wants to come in she does the reverse, where she goes to the door and barks a few times to be let in. This is great so far!  First Problem  This part is good for bathroom training but she also realizes that outside = play as well so she will constantly go by the door and bark many times a day to go play outside. The actual play itself isn't really a bad thing but more of an annoyance that she will go there so often. We can usually tell based on when she eats or drinks if she truly needs to go out for bathroom or just wants to play. If ignored at the door she will eventually go find something else to do inside.    So how can we curb this so she still goes to the door when needing to goto the bathroom but not constantly all the time? Is it bad that we ignore her whens he goes there if it is just for play?  Second Problem   For the same process, if we want her to come inside (like if we are heading out or something else) we will call her name followed by ""Come"". She will come to the door and sit at the bottom (which drives me nuts). We have tried using high value treats to get her to come up the stairs which works about 50% of the time but now I think she may be waiting a the steps because she knows if she waits there, she will get a treat to come up. We do give her treats when she comes in by herself as well to try and show that she gets it either way for coming in. So I feel like she is a very smart dog here and am unsure how to get her to come in more consistently so does anybody have any suggestions? "
2084,We found a dove. How do we care for it?,"We found one dove from outside so I want to know how old this bird is and what I can do for it?  I searched the internet and, based on it's photo shown below, I think it must be an adult.    This link suggests feeding carrots:     Doves should be offered fresh fruits and vegetables alongside seeds   and pellets. These add diversity to the bird's diet and give it a wide   variety of nutrients. Some items to give your dove include lettuce,   kale, broccoli, carrots, and apples   The photo of this bird shown below:    And     How long does it need to stay with me and what care does it need?  Update:  It has been better, although one week ago when I let it to try flying in my room, it's left wing has been fixed but now it has been stopped.   I am scared and haven't let it try flying in my room again so I put it in a cage in our house yard. Here are some pictures of it:    And this is its food (Is this enough / too much?):    I would greatly appreciate it if you kindly give me some feedback on this question. "
2085,training middle-aged cat to excrete outside,"summary: ~10-year-old female has been venturing outside for several months, after (per unverified claim) having been an indoor-only cat. She will come inside to excrete (urinate, defecate), then go back outside. How to train her to excrete outside?  details:  I have lots cat experience, but have never hosted a cat who was able to go outside but would not also ""go"" outside.  In April 2018, my mother got a cat from the local pound. (I do most of the catcare as part of eldercare.) The pound folk said the cat was 9 years old, had been indoor-only, and been declawed (front only) by her previous owners (as well as spayed). She was also definitely box-trained (very quickly taking over the local box), but has some non-standard excretion behaviors:   She will occasionally urinate (though not, fortunately, defecate) in the bathtub. This doesn't bother me--in fact, I prefer it, since it just goes down the drain without using up cat litter. (FWIW, she will not urinate in the adjacent shower stall, though she will go in there and look/sniff around.) She will not excrete outside: in fact, she will go out (unfortunately requiring someone to hold the catdoor (or another door) open--but that's a topic for another question), then come back in (which she usually does herself--i.e., she readily opens the catdoor from the outside but not the inside), excrete in litterbox or bathtub, then go back outside.   How to convince her to excrete outside?  Some additional data which may be relevant (or not):   She's the only cat in the house, and possibly the only cat in the neighborhood, though I occasionally see/hear evidence of ferals. Fear does not seem to be a factor, as she readily goes out and sniffs around, or sometimes just sits outside and watches. (She's not much of a hunter--having caught only 1 of the abundant local pocket mice, of which one of her predecessors caught at least 1 a day--but when one of the local rabbits ambles by, she and the rabbit will sit and stare at each other for amazingly extended periods.) I currently let her go outside only during (or just before/after) daylight  due to her inability to climb. She very much likes to go out at daybreak and nightfall, and would probably go out later at night if allowed. She has never, in my experience, gone farther than ~20 m from the house. This is not due to frailty--she's quite fast, and an excellent jumper, for a cat of her age and (rather small) size--but she's just not an exploring cat at present.  "
2086,My pet has a superficial wound on his foot. He's limping. How can I relieve his pain and cover the wound from infection?,"I took my Weimaraners, Cain and Abel for a late night walk last night. Not sure how but Abel hurt himself. He has a wound on his front, left leg and a slight limp. Don't want to wrap it with anything as I know he will have ripped it off the second I leave him to his own devices.   What can I do to help him:    Not infect the wound as he most definitely will from walking around Cover it so that he does not experience any pain and the wound does not get dirt and bacteria on it?   Thanks! "
2087,Can anyone explain me about this cat's behavior?,"I am watching this video on youtube. Is the cat trying to get close to the baby or is it some kind of aggressive behaviour? By the way, the cat in the video is a female cat and gave birth to three kittens last year.  "
2088,"Rabbit losing hair around face areas (eyes, nose and mouth)","I recently purchased a rabbit from a pet store. During the purchase, the rabbit have already had a wound on his back. It seems going to be better. After 2 days, he shed the fur around his mouth and nose area, but I can't find the shedded hair in the cage area. The next day, he started to lose fur around his eyes. He stop drinking water and just eats carrots.  What may be the causes? Is it virus?  "
2089,"Cat diet success vs unhealthy weight loss, how do I determine a healthy target weight?","I have a cat, domestic long hair, ragamuffin mix, male, 15 years old and in good health (bloodwork last month was stellar, and he doesn't act a day over 8), but I am concerned about his weight.  His weight has always been in the 13-14 lb range. He is a relatively large cat and also was a bit chunky on his underside. For years I fed him 4/3 cup dry food per day split morning and night.  In August 2014 he weighed in at 14.7 lbs and I decided to put him on a bit of a diet and started feeding him for a 12lb target weight, 1 cup per day split, Iams pro health senior dry food.  In August 2015 he was at 13.1 and much more active, so I changed nothing.  This month, August 2016 he was at a startling 10.1 lbs. He is as active as ever and like I said clean bill of health but I am slightly concerned. Vet does not seem concerned, and 10.1 lbs is normal for a Cat (TM) so it's hard to judge. I can't tell if this is bad, or if it is healthy, because I'm used to him being heavy.  Also it's hard to judge because I just shaved him, so he looks about half the size he usually does. Fwiw he does not look boney to me, at least, I can't see his ribs at all. He's got a bit of loose skin on his belly where his fat used to be.  For now, I have added 2.5 oz wet food in the morning to his normal daily 1 cup of dry food (his stool was slightly dry, although he was not constipated, that was his only issue).  One of my mistakes is I don't own a scale, I'm going to start monitoring monthly. But my questions are:   This seems sudden and was definitely unexpected, is it something I should be concerned about? How do I determine what a healthy target weight is for my cat? I mean Google gives a range for the ""average"" weight of ""a cat"" but there's too much variation to just pick a number. How can I judge what a stable healthy weight for a given specific cat should be? How do I know when to increase / decrease food portions?   I realize this question may be all over the place, what I'm really asking about is how to figure out what weight is healthy for any cat, based on observations of their health and activity (I have another 2 year old too and I suspect I'm going to have to watch her weight as well some day). "
2090,Betta hitting walls of tank in 'panic episodes' - What is causing this?,"Today my Beta started swimming like a mad man and hitting himself on the side of the bowl and ornamental plants. You can hear him crashing against these things.   I'm scared he's hurting himself. After some time has passed, he will have another episode. After these episodes he just lies at the top of the waterline and doesn't move much. He's not eating normally, but it's the thrashing that really has me worried.   Does anyone know anything about what this behavior could mean? Am I getting ready to loose my fish? "
2091,What is Fly Strike?,"I heard someone talking about ""fly strike' and their pet, what is it? Can it be prevented and/or treated?  "
2092,Male cat keeps trying to mate with female kittens,"Our story starts around a few months ago when a female cat gave birth to a 4 kittens in our backyard. At the time we didn't know what to do so we called RSPCA and asked them what we should do and they told us ""the mother cat will take care of the kittens just leave them alone and they will go away"", however my mother didn't want to leave them alone because she thought they would starve and she started buying food for them and the mother.   When the cats started opening their eyes this orange tomcat that walks around our neighbourhood randomly started coming to us and eating the food, at the time we thought nothing of it. However one day he decided to take one of the kittens overnight, (we know he did it because he was trying to accomplish it all day but we kept stopping him). We ended up thinking that he had eaten the kitten and we thought we could do nothing about it. One month later he comes back and starts to do this thing where he goes on top of the mother cat and bites her neck (mating I assume) However the mother cat doesn't allow him to do this and she usually walks away or fights him off.   Fast forward another month and now he is trying to do the same thing with the KITTENS! WHERE HE BITES THEIR NECK AND JUMPS ON THEIR BACK (again I assume this is mating).Roughly about 2 weeks ago he took another one of the kittens overnight however this one ended up coming back on its own. We always shoo him away. Recently the mother cat has stopped spending less time with her kittens and going away more and sometimes doesn't come back for a few nights We all assumed this was to get away from the male tomcat.   This morning he came back and started doing the thing where jumps on their back and starts biting the kittens necks again (one of the kittens has gotten to the point where the fur has started falling off and you can see some of his skin on his neck which is really disturbing and worrying). The mother cat has gotten to the point where she always runs away when she sees the tomcat and doesn't come back for a bit  We are really worried for the kittens and don't want them getting pregnant and having litter at such a young age. You are probably wondering why we haven't just brought the kittens into our house however when we do that they just hide behind the fridge or go into a really dark corner with wires which is really dangerous. What should we do? Is there people we can call to come take the cats away? We live in the UK so if you can give us any UK related homes or something to come take the kittens away. We are worried almost everyday.  "
2093,How do I get my mickey mouse platy back into labor?,"How can I get my mickey mouse platy to start birthing the young again? She had given birth to three - I wanna say - preemies because an egg was laying at the bottom of our breeder tank that I had her in she at two of the babies I was able to save the third baby and that baby is doing well.  I moved the mother back into the main tank and have the one baby in the breeder box. The babies where born on August 18th 2016 and it's now four days latter. The mother is still swimming and thriving, but still looks pregnant. She eats and is pooping really well and she is looking square in the normal pregnancy way too. She is showing signs of trying to go back into labor by hiding slow swimming movements too. Any advise on what to do?  I have the temp set between 78°F (25,5°C) and 80°F (26,5°C). I also have moved the live plants into the main tank and bought a separator to have the platy on the one side of the main tank and the Molly and cat fish on the other side. Our molly is not pregnant. This is I believe the platy's first set of baby fry. I have a ten gallon tank. "
2094,How can I tell if my cat food is spoiled?,I ordered wet cat food from Chewy - Sheba brand pate perfect portions. When I opened the container the consistency was different than usual. Instead of sort of solid wet it was more of watery with some consistency so not watery like liquid. The expiration date is good and the smell was good too. It seems like it was stored in a humid environment I guess. Anyway I fed Ali (my cat) some. He licked it and seem to like it but I am still concerned there is something wrong with the food. So my question is - is it okay I feed this to my cat? And if it is spoiled or not or if I should be aware of something? I don't know I just never had this happened before so I'm confused.  
2095,Eyeball going crazy in a Cockapoo,"I adopted a Cockapoo (not a F1 generation) puppy of 9 weeks old yesterday. He seemed very healthy and we saw the documents from the previous visit in the veterinary the breeder did, stating the dog is healthy (although had fleas).   Today, the puppy's left eyeball is very clearly not centered. Here is a picture    The breeder said he was in good health. I just sent him the picture but he hasn't answered yet. I also tried to contact the vet but the clinic is currently closed.  Can you give me some advice? What might likely be going on?  "
2096,Aquarium Filter... What's the order?,"Yesterday I bought a filter (top filter): a Sea Star HX-1480G, with F.Max is 2800L/H (which i means that it moves 2800 Litter of water per hour).  I installed   1 layer of a polyfiber pad at the bottom, a mix of a nitrate remover pad and a phosphate remover pad in the next layer, then on top filter peat/torf (any thing you call it, i got the word from text on the box, it says it decreases PH and KH) which the owner called substrate, or something like that.   In the morning i was reading the torf box, and it said ""Place after the mechanical-biological filteration, or hang directly in the aquarium netbag."", so I'm woried whether I might have misused it.  I also didn't get the bacteria media.  Questions:  Should I replace all these filtration layers monthly, or just the pad? I am facing higher costs due to exchange rates when importing these supplies.  (The filter has a large net so that I can't put some of my media without a pad over it, otherwise they bypass the net, and go inside the aquarium.)  Also the filter is rather full, what should I do if I want to add bacteria media?    Edit (2017/20/04)    previewsly i used to put flat stuf below, also the polyfiber, then the anti phosphate and another things above it, and then all other things as it is.  due to your answer, i reorder my filter today:  The bag contains ph-kh turfs, and other things beside it as you see, you know them better, i don't know well.  then the anti phosphate and anti nitrate  then the polyfiber, as there were old and for the flat surface above, they didn't fit the whole area, but i think it's ok for now... and then put them together..  is it right? "
2097,How to test if fish tank will break and flood my house?,"So in my city every year we have the council organised collection of large items for disposal, where people put the items out on the kerbside for collection. Mostly it really is just garbage, however sometime people just don't want it anymore.  I found an aquarium with a stand. I'm wanting to test to see if it can be a fish tank (not a half filled turtle tank), and want to know how to test if it is strong and sound enough and won't cause a flood or leak or the stand collapse when I bring it in to my house and fill it.  Assuming the test method is to take it outside, fill it up and see if it explodes   how long should I leave it filled up for the test to show any leaks? are there any other tests I should do? after emptying it and moving it inside, what are the signs to look for when filling it again that would indicate imminent failure leading to it flooding my house.   The tank is 120cm x 37cm x 45cm, LxWxH measured on the inside surface of the glass. That is 200L (52.8 gallons). The sides are 6mm and the base is 10mm thick glass. The stand provides support to the tank only around the perimeter of the tank on the 25mm box steel the stand is made from. There is no support under the middle of the tank.    I have a solid pine plank that is the right size and 26mm thick that I could put foam sheets on top of to provide more even support if you think it would be better than relying on the 10mm thick glass bottom.    Edit: well it holds a full load of water as shown in the pictures, at least overnight, and I can't find any external wet spots..  Edit 2: I moved the tank inside about 1.5 years ago and it is still leak free. I even added a 1.2m long 100 mm diameter pipe 3/4 filled with gravel to the top of the tank for an aquaponics grow bed. The pipe is supported by a couple of planks resting on the front and back panes of glass. Note some decorative house plants may leech toxins to the water and kill your fish. I've not had that problem with edible vegetable plants. "
2098,My cat won't eat food that she normally likes,"We're in a bit of a weird situation with our cat Rosie (female, 8 years old).  We've had her for most of her life, yet have never seen her refuse to eat her food as much as she has this week.  More specifically:   Rosie seems to be in good health, though we haven't taken her to the vet in a while.  She's not on any medications. Rosie is an outdoor cat; she walks around our neighborhood, but usually comes inside once or twice a day. She has not vomited, urinated, or pooped any more or any differently than usual, to the best of our knowledge (remember, we don't know where exactly she goes). She's lost a fair bit of weight recently, but she doesn't seem any more lethargic or frail than usual. This has only really been going on for the past week.   We've tried feeding her the following:   Several varieties of wet and dry food (mostly fish-based) Our dog's food Some combination of the above mixed with a special kind of goat milk   And we've tried giving it to her in the following ways:   Outside, near the door we usually let her in from Inside my room (she likes me the most) With our other cat temporarily locked in another room (she hates him)   Rosie normally eats this stuff.  She'll also eat the following (but we haven't tried it as we don't have any right now):   Turkey Cheese (either real cheese or vegan substitutes--though we've abandoned the idea of our pets eating vegan) Leftover fried rice   Is it possible that Rosie is sick?  Is she being fussier than usual?  Or is she just preparing for a modeling gig we weren't informed about? "
2099,How do I help my older cat maintain weight?,"We have a two cat household which includes a 16 year old skinny, spayed female and a 6 year old porky, spayed female. The older cat is a grazer, the younger eats everything in sight.   The old cat is healthy, but has gradually gone from about 7 1/2 lbs (her average adult weight) to 6 lbs. over the last 3 years. I am currently feeding her wet cat food every time she asks, about 9/10 times a day. She eats pretty much all I put down for her, leaving a crumb or two for ""porky"". Even with this feeding on demand, she continues to lose weight.  Is there a high calorie cat food that would be advisable for an older cat? Or any other advice for me to help her maintain, or even gain some weight? "
2100,"Ourdoor cat attacked my dogs on a walk, what should I do?","I have two small minpins, and as I was giving them their evening walk a cat darted out of the bushes and tried to attack them. My first reaction was to sling my dogs behind me, which forced the cat to overshoot and zip past us. As soon as it did, it stopped and came right back at us, so again I slang my (now yapping) dogs behind me, and it overshot. Again, it turned around and came back at us.  I was getting tired of playing matador and I didn't want to hurt my dogs by throwing them about by the neck, so on the cats next pass I managed to hook my foot under it and toss it away - not a kick, but as gentle a punt as I could manage to tell it to get lost. Again, as soon as it landed it came back, and as I was out of options I kicked it straight in the face, launching it right back into the bushes. I heard it scurry away and it never came back.  After we got home I checked my dogs to see if they'd been hurt, and thankfully there wasn't a scratch on them.  What should I have done in this situation? I feel bad for hurting an animal (especially since I don't know if it was feral or not - I was too busy protecting my dogs to notice a collar) but I couldn't think of any other way to keep it away.  If it was somebodies pet, could they take legal action against me? Or is it the owners responsibility since their pet was attacking mine? "
2101,Tube seems really small,I'm looking at different cages for our hamster (can't remember what kind she is...she's just avg size) but the tubes/tunnels that come with them seem really narrow for our hamster.  Can they fit thru a tube that is smaller than they are?? 
2102,How does a bird know its owner?,"I have cockatiels that always fly to my dad, or sometimes my grandpa. They rarely fly to my mom or me - only when we have food. We think it's because the previous owner was male. But how do they recognize the owner? Do they recognize gender? Is it based more on auditory than visual input? Is olfaction involved? "
2103,Are stray cats dangerous to newborn kittens?,"A stray cat gave birth next to our building a few weeks ago. We check in on her almost every day. She has been taking care of her kittens well, and us, as well as other neighbors have been leaving cat food and bowls of water around where she's nesting with her kittens. Right now, the kittens are about 4 weeks old, are just starting to meow and explore around their nesting area, not yet able to stroll too far.   Gradually, more and more stray cats have been drawn to the area due to the opulence of food and water. Some of them were always around, but more and more of them have been starting to show up. Right now, around the building, there are about a dozen cats, where before there were around 7 or 8.  Some nights, I hear intense cat fights occur outside. I can't tell if the mother or the kittens are involved somehow in the fights because the area isn't well lit at nights, but when I check on them in the morning, they all seem well and healthy.  My question is - could stray cats pose any danger to the mother or the kittens? We are meaning to adopt the kittens, but want to wait for them to ween from their mother, ideally at around 10 weeks. I realize that separating a kitten from its mother earlier than this increases the risk of health or behavioral damage, but if the kittens could be in danger, what would be the right course of action? "
2104,How dangerous is the current situation for my turtles?,"I have two Red-eared turtles (I was wrong in my former question about them being ""trachemys scripta scripta"": they are trachemys scripta elegans; don't know whether it makes a significant difference in the question I have now, but just to clarify the readers), in my aquarium (50x30x6cm water, some rocks and dry stuff, and a warmer). I clean my aquarium once a week, replacing the water, and everyday I add two drops of methylene blue to the aquarium (and also feed them, once a day).  The warmer got broken (don't know why, nor how - I just saw the turtles were less active today, and the first thing I checked was the water warmer and temperature: the warmer was like scratched in the surrounding glass). I don't know when did it broke, but was between yesterday night (perhaps 10pm, or today after 00hs) and today morning (before 8:30am). I disconnected it when I saw it scratched. At 13:00hs here, I'm planning to buy a new one. Current environmental temperature (11:30hs now) is 21°C.  Is it somehow dangerous for the turtles the current situation? Should I take additional* cares/checks on the turtles?  (* besides running as fast as I can to buy and install a new warmer) "
2105,Would an alligator decoy work to deter herons in a state where alligators don't live?,"I've heard that placing an alligator decoy in a pond will deter herons from visiting stopping by to eat all the expensive koi that live in it.  This made me curious, because I live in a northern state where alligators don't exist, would a decoy still be effective in deterring herons? Presumably herons migrate south during the winter, and should be aware of the threat that alligators pose, but would they recognize that alligators don't live this far north and ignore the decoy? "
2106,Can I leave a water dish in a Kenyan Sand Boa's tank?,"Sand Boas need warm/hot temperatures and very low humidity, generally speaking. During shedding, for snakes having trouble, especially eye caps, I've read that putting a water source (or humidity source) in the boa's environment can help. I'm concerned about the ability to retain the standard humidity levels though.  Is it generally recommended to leave a water dish in the tank, full time? What about only during shedding? "
2107,Is my red eared slider eggbound?,"My female red eared slider has been showing signs that she wants to lay eggs for the past week, with a small appetite, wanting to leave her home, and is constantly digging with her legs. Because of this, I've moved her to the kitchen where she has laid a few eggs underneath a rack last year. However, a week has gone by and although she exhibits digging motion, she hasn't laid any eggs.   Yesterday (this is what worries me) she has completely stopped trying to leave her home, does not exhibit digging motions when she is let out, and has a large appetite. It's like she's given up on trying to lay eggs. On top of that she looks slightly depressed and bites people to try to touch her, which is irregular. I'm worried that she has failed to find a proper nest and has decided to keep them, in other words egg-binding which I've discovered whilst searching the net.  Should I be worried and take her to a vet? Or should I wait a while to see if she wants to lay eggs again, and prepare a proper nesting area for her? "
2108,How can I remove multiple ticks from a dog quickly?,"There's a female stray dog in my area who was recently spayed and as being spayed in a poor Indian government hospital she's got ticks all over her body.   Manual removal of the ticks is not possible because she won't sit still for long, and I can't give her a bath for a month as she was spayed recently.   Is any spray which will help to get rid of ticks? And also is there any natural anti-tick stuff? "
2109,How do I choose an Omega-3 supplement for an elderly dog?,"I've read that it is recommended to give Omega-3 to elderly dogs (especially ones with arthritis) (for example, here).   My dog is a 15 years old female medium sized, mixed breed (probably mostly German Shepard), weighing approximately 25 kg (55 lbs).   My questions are:    What amount of Omega-3 should I give her? Does the source of the Omega-3 matter (e.g. fish oil)?   "
2110,Getting a puppy to toilet outside?,"Ok so I read over... this question and there were some really good tips here, however... My 3 month old Shetland Sheepdog just won't go outside in the first place...  He is paper trained for inside, and in the day he has someone come see him to look after him, to let him out in the garden etc. Our aim is to give him treats when he toilets outside - at this point I'm not fussed about where in my garden he toilets so long as it IS in my garden, however he has stopped toileting outside and waits to go inside again. He used to toilet outside, and would receive plenty of fuss etc for doing so. He has a daily 20 minute walk - with a good 20 minute break in the middle where we sit and he can sniff around and relax - but he won't toilet on walks either, even when we walk with a friend and her dog goes.  Recently we spent 4 hours out with a friend, in her garden, on a walk etc and he held his bladder for the entire time and only went when we got home, which seems an incredible feat for a 3 month old small breed pup...   What we are doing... is that when he starts to go to the toilet inside we open the back door and move him to some newspaper outside (this is linked to how my in laws toilet trained their Shelties) however he then just clams up and won't continue... Until he is allowed back inside. Often he will toilet inside and then sit at the back door and ask to go out, which is the wrong order!  What can we do to improve this situation? Will moving him outside eventually click, if we use treat training, and as he becomes more controling of his ablutions?  Update taking Cedrics advice we played ball in the garden for a good 10 minutes and got our first outdoor wee wee in three weeks. Duely rewarded too! "
2111,Are fatty cheeks on a cat indicative of a communicable disease?,"I live on a pretty big property and we've had all kinds of animals. We got our first cat about 10 years ago, when my dog ran off and brought him home. She hatched him and licked him to his annoyance for the rest of her life. Besides that, he's a little hellion. He beats the other dogs on a regular basis and seems to have a special hate for other cats. He is fixed, but he hisses and attacks other cats.  For whatever reason, a new cat has been coming around and my cat doesn't seem to mind him. He/she isn't exactly feral as I'm pretty sure he used to be the neighbor's and just ran off. He's usually pretty shy, but came up for me to pet him/her tonight. He seemed okay, with just a little scabbing on his body, which I assume is for fighting, as my cat has gotten similar ones in the past.  However, when I was running my hand down to scratch it's chin, I felt it's cheeks. They were very large and round. It was like that on both sides. It felt firm and fatty. The cat wasn't really fat anywhere else, not skinny, but not fat. What I'm worried about is it being a symptom of something wrong with it that could make my cat sick.  So does this sound like the cat could be sick or does it just have fat cheeks? I realize that no one on here is a vet and that you can't see the cat. My cat experience is fairly limited, but I've never run across one with fat cheeks like this one. I just want to know if there are any communicable cat diseases with swollen cheeks are a symptom? Thanks. "
2112,Affectionate Pawing & Meowing,"Why does my cat affectionately paw me on the face every time I sit on the toilet?  It is quite cute. Only on the toilet.  At other moments in the day, why does he meow as if he is talking to me too?  He is definitely not asking for the door, or something to eat. His bowl is never empty. He never goes out, unless it is an accident. I make a point of ignoring him just to be sure he doesn't learn a behaviour.  Often when he meows now, to test him, I pick him up and cuddle him and bounce him in my arms like a baby. He enjoys that, especially the scratches I give him. I think he is just lonely, especially when I come home after a long day - so he vocalises.  These are both new behaviours.   To put my question in context, he is two years old. Was castrated at 8 weeks. But was born very wild - a real gutter, rescue cat. The mother was fixed and then permitted to live outdoors. She was not rescue-able - a real savage. She was too distressed in captivity. She even looked like a very small mountain lion from her colours. :)  It makes me wonder because her son, my tabby can also display quite aggressive, wild behaviour too. He will on other occasions arrive out of nowhere and throw his front paws around my leg, as if - I learned - he was practising taking down prey. My other cats never tried to kill me!   He also bites, for no reason, my daughter - out of the blue. I think this might be a pack order thing. He won't do that to me.  Until this cat, my Caesar Milan methods have worked on my former cats - a good bite and take-down made them calm submissive :P Not so much this cat. Although right now he is cuddled next to my leg, very subordinate :) very much a member of my pack.  So the ""affectionate"" pawing thing I read on the post below is quite the opposite answer I was expecting.  All the same, I learned from other cats that after you have them shaved for the first time, they spend more time on your legs or lap just to get warmth. I believe the warmth helps tame them and reduce anxiety. Good training-bonding idea?  So I'm confused. He paws my face to be affectionate. He vocalises because he is lonely? At other moments he stalks me like prey? And he puts my daughter in her place?  Ref: Why does my cat keep patting my face?

2113,What are the considerations for metacam vs aspirin for a rabbit in longterm therapy,A recent comment on How to give aspirin to a rabbit? brought up the topic of Metacam (Meloxicam) vs Aspirin (Acetylsalicylic acid) for long-term pain management in rabbits with arthritis or other age-related issues. They are both NSAIDs or Nonsteroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs.    What are the known risks and benefits of metacam vs aspirin for long-term pain management therapy in rabbits?   Answers that focus on herbivore research are preferable to answers with research based on carnivores or omnivores.  
2114,Is cleaning a dog's floppy ears necessary?,"Me again. So my baby, Peanut, now a 14 month old female spayed Dachshund is growing into herself. I figure she's as big as she'll get, which is pretty darned small. (She's a miniature.) I've read that bathing your dog regularly (more than, say, once every couple months) is not recommended. We don't, and she really doesn't need it. She rarely smells 'dog-ish'.     Knowing that, is it recommended to clean out her ears? A Dachshund is a 'floppy-eared' type.   If it is so recommended, how often should we do it? I am currently cleaning them weekly, but they never seem to need it.  "
2115,What is the difference between salmon/fish oil for a cat and a human?,"One of my cats is suffering from a nasty bought of dry skin. He's a new adoptee, and is quite overweight. I am feeding him a healthy amount of wet food, and although he has access to free feeding of dry, does not seem to participate in the munching of the crunches.  I noticed the dry skin fairly soon after adopting him, but have tried to give him time to adjust to his new diet. The problem hasn't resolved itself yet, so my next step is to try some salmon oil or fish oil. I have consulted a vet on this.  Only, the oils marketed to pet owners are incredibly overpriced compared to the capsules marketed to humans. I want to buy the cheaper option, because it irks me that the cat version is $10 or more simply because it has ""for cats"" on the label.   Are they truly equal? If I buy the human salmon oil, can I just pop it open onto his wet food and be done with it, or is there ingredients (or lack of ingredients) that make the cat salmon oil special?  (picture of his disarrayed lazy self: [website]"
2116,How long does it take for furosemide/lasix to be effective in a cat?,"Hunter was recently diagnosed with restrictive cardiomyopathy (a heart condition that led to fluid accumulating in his heart and lungs).   We were instructed to monitor his condition by measuring his breathing rate regularly. To do this, we should count the number of breaths (an inhalation and exhalation) that he takes in a minute. We were instructed to do this when he is relaxed or asleep.  Hunter is currently receiving 10 mg of furosemide (lasix) every 12 hours to reduce fluid retention in his lungs. We were instructed to administer an additional dose (10 mg) if his breathing rate becomes elevated (normal for him is about 22 breaths per minute). We were further instructed that if his breathing rate continues to be elevated (or is above 40 breaths per minute) we should take him to the nearest emergency vet.  When I have to give him an additional dose of furosemide, how long should I expect it to take to become effective? If his breathing rate is elevated but below 40 bpm, how long should I monitor him before taking him to the emergency vet? "
2117,How to do an 8-hour road trip with a husky puppy,"I will be travelling with a female Siberian Husky puppy in about a month from now, and by then my pup would've been 2 1/2 months old. I'm a bit uncertain on how i'm going to do this, I've crawled the net to find resources but they're too general and I believe this is the best place still to ask this specific question to pet owners who have done similar based on knowledge and experience.   I will try to be as objective as possible and will also accept the most objective answer.  Here goes :  Trip Details  1) I live in the Philippines, it's tropical country, but so far most huskies living here have adapted to the kind of climate. (But not direct sunlight of course).  2) The road is 330 kilometers (about 205 miles). Partly dirt road, partly asphalt. A little climb from here and there.  3) Trip usually takes about 8-9 hours at an average of 50-60kph with moderate traffic.  4) I ride a toyota Avanza, a mini SUV (about 7 seats), A little cramped up but good.  5) I drive alone, no one will be with me. (that kind of makes it a problem)  Question :  I'm a little paranoid but I really want to do this correctly and safely (both for me and the puppy). So, how do we survive this kind of trip? Some questions I would like to ask would be :  1) Pet crate or should I fold the seats and let her roam free inside the car? Or should she be in the front seat, or maybe on top of my lap while I drive?  2) Medications? Do they ever get dizzy? or something similar perhaps?  3) Food? should I feed her before the trip? if then how long before the trip? Should or shouldn't I feed her along the way? at how much time intervals?  4) How often should we go for stops?  5) Other details I might miss?  Thanks! "
2118,"How can I teach my parrot to say ""Help! I've been turned on into a Parrot!""",We just got a lovely parrot named Jhon. We want to teach him to yell that he has been turned on into a Parrot.  Is repetition the only way?  Are there any rewarding teaching method's using food like we do with dogs? 
2119,How to get a roommate's dog to stop harassing girlfriends?,"The problem: I bring over a date to the house. Roommate's dog does not leave us alone.   Well first, violence is not an option since it's usually a big turnoff to company. Separating the dog from us with a baby gate makes it cry and whine. Acknowledging the dog makes it worse, and he doesn't do it unless I have someone relatively new, thus making it hard to reproduce and ergo train.  My dog goes and finds a place to sleep when I have someone over, but from the very beginning as a puppy I taught him that he's not the center of attention and should not be around unless there's a reason. So this good behavior is just a side effect of proper training from the start.  This dog does not have that benefit of good, proper training. How can I train someone else's dog to mind his own business? Any tips? It is very aggravating since the dog in general doesn't have manners. "
2120,How do I control weeds with dogs present?,"Is it safe to use round-up on my weeds and / or weed and feed in my yard, although the dogs go out in the yard?  My concern is if they eat the weeds, they would be poisoned, or they could possibly even be harmed by walking in it.  If both these products are harmful, do you have any suggestions for weed control that is safe for pets? "
2121,"Can cats be ""picky"" about the brand of food they eat?","The cat I had growing up was very picky about the kind of food we gave him. He had a thing for Meow Mix dry cat food. If we bought him any different brand, it seemed as though he wouldn't eat it as much or as quickly, so we always stuck with the Meow Mix to keep him happy and well fed. He also refused wet food.  Why did he do this? I have heard of cats having a preference between dry and wet food, but is there really that much difference in the brands of cat food that he could taste? If so, what makes one brand more preferable to cats than another? Or was this all in our imagination and he really didn't care either way? "
2122,How can I stop my cat's playful yet aggressive behavior?,"I have recently (three months ago) adopted a cat from a rescue shelter. He is around 1 or 2 years old, and probably a Maine Coon mix. Half the time he's a sweet, affectionate lovebug, but the other half of the time he's a hyper terror. He will attack and bite (hard!) my feet when I'm walking around, and will sometimes do the ""halloween cat"" pose with his back arched and tail poofed out.   How can I get him to channel his playfulness at his toys (of which he has plenty), rather than my feet? What is the best way to react when he bites to stop him from doing it? Would getting another cat so he has a playmate help? "
2123,How should I select a puppy from a litter?,"I've heard different recommendations on how to pick a puppy from a litter to fit a person's needs/lifestyle. I've heard that if I live an active lifestyle, then I should pick the one that runs up to me first, because that one is going to be the friendliest, and easiest to train.  On the other hand, I've also heard not to pick that one, because it will have the most energy, and therefore harder to train. So if I don't live a very active lifestyle, or if I have children, then I should pick the one in the back instead, because it will be the gentlest and calmest.  But, I've heard that the one in the back is also a bad choice, because it's more likely to have problems socializing.  I've always gone by look (a bit shallow I know), but is there really a way you can tell from a litter of puppies how they'll be for the rest of their lives? Is there any truth to these guidelines? "
2124,Is there a home remedy for a dog with a stomach flu?,"My dog has had diarrhea for two days. :( Is there anything I can give him to settle his stomach? He's not eating or drinking much. He was hiding all day yesterday and lying around, which is out of character for him, so I think he feels pretty bad. I just put him in his crate since he was making a mess, too. Someone once told me pedialyte can be given to dogs if they get dehydrated, so does anyone know about this too?  "
2125,"Do puppies ""grow into their feet""?","Some puppies seem to have feet to big for their body.  I have often heard that this is an indicator of a dog that will grow to be a larger dog.

2126,Cat Crohn's Disease - What can he eat?,"My cat has Crohn's disease, which basically means he throws up from almost anything.

2128,Can I locate my cats' feeding maze close to their litter-box?,"I have two cats. We feed them wet food daily (in the kitchen far from the litter-box) and we provide them free access to dry kibble all day long.  The litter-box and the feeding zone are located in the ""no-dog"" part of the house and are in the same room.  We've never add any (apparent) problem with that setup: both cats are using the litter-box with no issue and both cats are eating a few times a day.  I know this is not the ideal situation but we've never add any problem and I'm trying to find a balance between the theoretical ideal setup (2+1 litter-boxes, feeding in another room, etc.). Should I worry about that?  I'm also planning to change their bowl with a feeding maze (see picture). Would it be acceptable for them to ""play"" close to their letterbox? Should I just try and if they use it conclude that it is OK with them?   "
2129,Got a new second cat. previous cat is not happy,"I have a 4 month old cat and now I got a second kitten. They don't really like each other. My first cat hisses at the new kitten at eye contact and the kitten hides in a corner next to the closet. I have already separated them and given the kitten some time to get used to the room. Later the old cat came along and doesn't seem aggressive to her. She does her own thing as usual only as soon as she sees the new cat, the hissing starts again and the kitten hides. But from the first cat comes no aggression, only hissing and a look of death (no hump either).  The problem now is that I can't keep the two cats away from each other any longer, because I only have one litter box and I always have to seal one off.  Furthermore, I noticed that my first cat also starts to hiss at my hands after my hand has taken on the smell of the new cat. My first cat also hisses at the corner where the new cat was hiding, even though she wasn't there at the time.  seperated, both cats are very calm. Both are female.  Currently I am still on vacation so I can with the cats but when I have to work again I am afraid that the new kitten will have to hide my entire working time in the corner next to the closet from fear.  My question to you would be:  What can I do to get both cats used to each other with currently only one litter box? What do I do when I am going to sleep today? "
2130,My dog killed a bunny in my yard,"I adopted a lab from the local shelter about a week ago, he is about 1 year old.

I let him outside my yard and my neighbor's bunny got in and my dog killed it. Should I be concerned for my cat and will this trigger some sort of change in his behavior?

I will not need to leave for the treatment (ie it is not being fumigated). Should I remove my bird from the premises while this is happening? If so, for how long?  --  As an update, I ended up not removing my bird from the apartment. One of the two rooms of my apartment was being treated, so I put her in the non-treated room prior to the exterminator arriving, and kept her there for about four hours after the treatment. She was next to an open window in this room.  "
2132,"Former stray - LOVES pets, hates seeing hands","About a year ago, my parents adopted a stray female tortie who used to hang around our backyard. She would wait at the door and beg to be let in so they finally gave up. She's been to the vet, she was someone's pet at some point (not feral and litter trained) but had been out on her own for years.  She loves attention and will scream meow at you until you pet her. She jumps on our laps and motor boat purrs while you pet her. But if she sees your hand, she flips out, jumps up, hisses and swipes.  Then she immediately throws her butt on the ground next to us and side swims (not sure how to describe it, she uses her paws and claws to push herself around on the floor in circles?) while you scratch her back. She purrs, loves it, asks for chin scratches - and then again, catches sight of our hand or even wrist and loses her sh*t.  She never really gets us and her claws aren't even out when she swipes, but it's definitely a fear based reaction. We don't know much about her history but think she was mistreated somehow. It's the quick switch back to wanting pets and the randomness of her getting set off that confuses me.  We board her at a vet when we're on vacation and they love her, she has no health issues and is definitely not feral. Any thoughts on how to pinpoint what causes this, or how to get her used to seeing our hands? I don't know what she thinks we're petting her with!!  Thanks in advance. "
2133,My rat is grieving over missing cage mate,"One of my rats died at 800 last night. I let the mate out to run while I cleaned up the cage. I never thought to let him say goodbye to his brother. He was not acting himself, normally running like crazy, let me pet and scratch him.    I still have the body. It hasn’t bee 24 hours yet. Is it wise to let him see the body at this point? He is eating and drinking so far but his look is different.   And should I get him a replacement?  Thanks "
2134,Cat is losing fur around neck and ears. Is it some kind of disease? How to cure it?,"There's an outdoor cat who comes to our home very often. I don't know what has happened but her fur around neck has almost gone. Even on her head and ears, the fur has started to fall out. Also she has little blood oozing out of the areas where her fur is thinning out. Is she suffering from some kind of disease? What can I do to help her out? Note that she's a feral cat and doesn't come into our hand for us to take her to vet.  "
2135,Can dogs become lovesick?,"Our dog (male, a bit less than 2 years old, not neutered) has changed his behavior for a few days now:   He whines quite often, a lot more than he did before he eats only half of his bowl of food, and isn't interested in treats like he used to be he seems to want to cuddle all the time - he used to like that previously, but much less than now.   We're considering taking him to the vet, however   his nose, tongue, and eyes are just like they've always been, no fever, dry nose or teary eyes or anything he likes his walks like he always did when we let him off the leash, he loves running around, chasing birds, anything, and doesn't seem the slightest bit exhausted   so he doesn't seem to us like he was sick. He had gut worms about 4 weeks ago, got a pill from the vet, and there haven't been any signs of worms or eggs in his poop ever since, so we can rule this out. Also, he gets about 2 hours of exercise per day, plus time in the garden, so we don't think he's bored (and he doesn't show any signs of boredom like chasing his tail e.g.).  Our neighbor said we shouldn't worry, he just wants to have sex, and the whole episode should be over in 2 weeks. I know that female dogs are in heat for a while every now and then, but males? Could this explain his behavior? Or should we take him to the vet, just to make sure? "
2136,Spots on cat's nose,"I have recently noticed several spots on my black cat's nose. At first I thought they were just dust spots but they don't wipe off and have a slightly raised texture. He seems to have developed a few more since I first noticed them. They are not filled with an kind of pus. They are small and just slightly discolored from his normal black nose, probably around 10 bumps.  Should I be concerned about these spots? What might they be? "
2137,Obesity in indoor cats compared to outdoor cats,Are there any statistics / findings on obesity rates in strictly indoor cats as compared to outdoor cats? Does giving a mostly indoor cat some time outside often result in noticeable weight loss? 
2138,Efficient aquarium cooler,"I wonder if it'd be a good idea to cool an aquarium with an external source of water, e.g., pool water. Because my tank runs hot in summer (~30C) and needs to be brought down to 25C, I was thinking if it'd be a good idea to have the extra (plastic?) storage cooled by circulating a ring of (salt) pool water around it. Will this likely be effective? Plastic storage probably won't be ideal since it's an insulator.  Any idea appreciated. "
2139,How does my dog know we're almost home?,"When I'm driving home from some place and my dog is in the car, he always knows when we're close to home (say, a minute from home) as he gets all excited. My question is: how does he know we're almost there?    He's a very small dog on the car floor, so he doesn't see out of the windows. I think smells are to rule out too because this happens with all the windows closed and even if there's food in the car, the smell of which should cover any subtle hints. And I don't see how the vicinity of my house should smell differently than the rest of the small village I live in. He could have memorized a set of turns on the road to the house, but there are at least 3 different roads we could be coming from, and I doubt he's smart enough to have memorized and recognize all of them just by feeling the turns.   what's my dog's secret sixth sense? Either I'm underestimating dogs' sense of smell or their ability to memorize routes from just feeling acceleration in turns, I think. "
2140,Can a red belly black snake kill a horse? How would I know if my horse has been bitten?,"My horse was eating and jumped back from her feed bowl and wouldn't go back to it. I thought she may have been stung by the electric fence, but thought that was strange as she was well aware of how to avoid it.  So I took some feed in to put in a tyre feeder that was on the ground and I could move it away from the fence. She wouldn't come near it. So I pulled the tyre feeder away from the fence (only a foot it was heavy) and found a red belly black snake curled up under it.   The horse knew the snake was there.   Someone told me they thought their horses were being killed by red belly black snakes and it got me thinking. Red belly black snakes are venomous, but they're not aggressive, they avoid people. I don't know much about their interactions with horses. Interestingly the snake moved very slowly. It was something my son and I commented on. It was later in the day and there had been plenty of warmth and sun (it's Spring), so either the snake was scared or possibly injured, although I could not see any visible signs of injury.  Are red belly black snakes venomous to horses? How can I tell is my horse has been bitten? "
2141,How can I train cats to have consistent behaviors with minimal reinforcement?,"My parents have two cats, who are great cats, but have learned some slightly annoying habits since I left for college.  My parents don't maintain reinforcement of what I taught the cats.    I will have the cats for 2-3 weeks, and plan to use that time to teach them better habits for my parents.  Unfortunately, I know that whatever I teach the cats will not be consistently enforced once I return them to my parents.  The habit I'm most interested in addressing now is Silver's tendency to start meowing excessively, and get right underfoot when he thinks someone is about to get out the wet cat food (once a week).  I want to make him less of a nuisance when the food is being prepared.  His trained ""good"" behavior will be rewarded by only giving him his wet cat food if he behaves.  My parents will not enforce this rule; he will get wet cat food regardless of his behavior.  I plan to convince him that food is a reward for his ""good"" behavior, so he will maintain the ""good"" behavior longer.  I can handle the training; my question is, what exact training is most likely to stick, considering the teachings will not be properly enforced?  Another example is if I teach him to sit on a vocal command until he is fed, my father won't use the command until Silver has annoyed him, at which point Silver may have already figured out food is incoming and he doesn't need to listen to get his food.  Should I train Silver by putting the can away when he starts begging for it, to try to teach him that begging means he doesn't get a reward; will that stick with him longer then the idea that sitting gets a reward?  In a nutshell, how do I get the most idiot-proof training that will stick to the cats without anyone consistently reinforcing the habits?  I plan to continue reinforcements on my weekend visits. "
2142,How to interact with a cat that has fleas?,"I'm returning home to my outdoor cats. The problem is that they were not given flea medication during this time. This is what I'll do as soon as I'm back and see them. Between the time it takes for the medication to work and kill the fleas, how should I interact with the cats? Should I wash my clothes after? How? And is washing my hands enough to prevent me from getting them? "
2143,How do I choose a good brand of cat food?,"For both dry and wet food, what criteria can I use to determine on my own if it is a high quality food for my cats (normal, healthy cats)?  In the past I've had experiences where, when I told the vet what food I was using, they would say ""Don't use that, it's not good food, use this other brand instead."" How does the vet know? I would like be able to make those kinds of decisions on my own because the brand my vet explicitly recommends isn't always available.  However, it's problematic because price (""it's more expensive, it must be better""), packaging (""that design looks professional, it must be better""), and labeling (""the words 'healthy' and 'recommended' are on the package, it must be better"") are very distracting. I don't actually know what I'm looking for. The only thing I'm somewhat confident about is choosing the appropriate target cat age based on labeling.  What should I look for in a good food? "
2144,How do you put one cat on a diet when you have two cats and only one needs to lose weight?,I have two cats and one is very over weight (18 lbs) while the other is a very healthy weight.  The smaller cat never over eats but the larger cat always eats too much.  I keep dry food out for them all the time but that method of feeding is clearly not working for the larger cat.    I've thought about trying to put the smaller cat's food up higher but the large cat is still very agile and can get wherever the smaller cat can.    Any suggestions as to the best way to helping the larger cat lose weight without completely changing the smaller cat's routine?  Also any thoughts on the best amount of food food to start feeding the larger cat when I put him on a diet? 
2145,Rabbit integration tips & tricks?,"I am currently trying (and failing miserably) to integrate my two outdoor rabbits. My first rabbit (Diego) is a neutered male 1 year old Lionhead, he is very friendly, confident and usually very well behaved and has never bitten anyone (human!) ever. My second rabbit (Yoda) is a neutered male 6 months old Netherland dwarf (he was given to me as a surprise gift) he is very timid and can be very shy but is also very friendly and is not a biter either.  Now I know the fact that a large difference in breeds/size and the fact they are both males is a factor here, before any of you jump to that.  Not integrating them is not the end of the world as I will simply have them live separately, however i thought it might be good for my rabbits to be able to be 'friends' and have the company. I have tried quite a few times to slowly introduce them to each other on neutral territory for 10 minutes at a time, the first few times were fine (lots of sniffing and grooming each other) however it has only gotten worse. Yoda is very inquisitive about Diego and will sniff, lick and sometimes he actually nuzzles into Diego's bottom region but Diego now refuses to get along with Yoda and will try to bite and (on one occasion) growls, once this happens they are immediately separated again and Yoda is checked over. I have also tried putting Yoda into a large cage each day and putting him in Diego's run for Diego to see that Yoda is there and see how he feels about him, Diego would be inquisitive about Yoda and would sometimes lay, groom himself and eat next to cage with Yoda.  My main questions are they just too different? Could it ever work despite gender/size issues? Do any of you have any tips or tricks for integration?   (one trick i've heard of and yet to try is to put vanilla essence on their noses to supposedly trick them into thinking they smell the same..?) "
2146,High nitrate level in tap water,"I'm quite new to owing fish, we have a 65 litre (14g) tank with 6 minnow, 2 danni, 2 platy and a Hong Kong plec which has been running for around 1 month.  During this month I have learnt a lot about water chemistry and would like to ask some advice on how to move the water chemistry in the right direction.  The stats for our tank are: PH: 8.2, Amonia: 0.25ppm, Nitrite: 0.25ppm, Nitrate: 40-60ppm  The stats for water directly out of our tap are: PH: 7.2, Amonia: 0.25ppm, Nitrite: 0ppm, Nitrate: 40-60ppm  (Both test acquired using an API test kit)  I would like to know how if a PH of 8.2 is within a good range for the fish in our tank (if not what could be done to correct this)? What would be the best cause of action for reducing the nitrate levels in our water? I am guessing that regular water changes won't make much difference to the nitrate levels as they are so high straight from the tap.  So far I have added the following chemicals with water changes: Tetra AquaSafe, Tetra EasyBallance &amp; API Quick Start. The Tetra chemicals have been used since the tank was acquired, the API Quick Start was used during a 25% water change done yesterday.  I have also started replacing the fake aquarium plants with live plants as I have heard that they can help to reduce the nitrate levels in the water.  Is my only/best option to buy bottled water or are there other/more effective solutions? "
2147,Is it okay to let dogs play in a backyard with a pool unsupervised?,"Our 6 month Golden Retriever really enjoys playing in the back yard that has a pool. She has not been in the pool yet but does not seem interested in it either way.   She plays in the back yard but I worry if she accidentally fell in the pool, she may not find the steps out. I will teach her how to swim this summer but the real issue is getting back out.   Is a pool ramp the best strategy here?   Are there any other ways to keep a dog safe with a pool? "
2148,Do recently neutered male dogs have a tendency to gain weight?,"My dog is being neutered as I'm writing.  He is a Brittany, 21 months old and is quite light weight (15.5kg). He's having quite a lot of exercice, a least 3 hours off leash per day in a dog park or in the woods.  What should I expect in term of weight gain? Should I pay close attention in the coming weeks/months? "
2149,Cat throwing litter out of box!,"My cat throws her litter way out of her box. I've used mats, newspaper, and AstroTurf but she manages to fling it way beyond even that. She won't use a covered box either. It doesn't matter if the litter is fresh or a few days old she does the same thing and sometimes she digs and doesn't even use the box it's like she's digging just to dig! I really have no idea how to break her of this behavior and any input would help! How can i stop this behavior??? "
2150,How to humanely discourage a dog from barking?,"After reading this very unpleasant next item (a dog whose muzzle was shut with electrical tape) I became curious: how would you humanely discourage, prevent or forbid a dog to bark excessively ? "
2151,Do I need to fence of my balcony to prevent my rabbit from falling down?,"I live in an apartment several floors up, and I have a balcony with vertical railings that are large enough for a rabbit to pass through.  How well do rabbits deal with heights like this?  Do I need to add chicken wire and/or board of a part of my balcony to prevent the rabbit from falling down? And if so, what's a good way to do it (and how high should this be? 50cm? 200cm? A meter?)  A picture of said balcony:   "
2152,Is a life jacket for long haired dogs a requirement?,"Our Sheltie, when fully grown, will be joining us more and more in our outdoor life styles. He's already experienced geocaching, but has mountain climbing, hiking and kayaking to come. Also both sides of our family are heavily into sailing / yachting etc.  We are expecting that he will require a life jacket, as Shelties are incredibly long haired and he may possibly struggle even in calm water such as a canal (Grand Union, England).  There is a small (very small!) Yorkshire terrier in the family who has a life jacket for his trips out on the family boat (at sea) and I know they struggled to find one. However for now we will keep Blaze to calm waters on the canals.  What I want to know is... Should we make him wear a life jacket even if he is perfectly ok swimming in calm water? Would his long hair effect his ability to swim or would it be more of a struggle? "
2153,What are these odd bumps on my Dachshund's cheeks?,"Our Dachshund puppy has started to grow three odd bumps: one on each cheek and a smaller one on the underside of her chin.    Please examine this photo taken just a moment ago...    I have circled the bump in red. It has two hairs growing out of it.  The symmetrical one on her right cheek also has two hairs growing out of it, and the less pronounced bump under her chin has about 5 hairs growing out of it.  What problem, if any, do these odd bumps (or moles?) indicate?  Or alternatively, should we approach the vet to have them removed? "
2154,How to get rid of fish oil stink on a dog?,"I gave my dog a cap of fish oil and now he reeks of fish. I don't even have to go anywhere near his mouth to smell it. I can smell it from the end of the leash and while I sit on the couch and him on the floor. Also, I made sure that the bottle of fish oil caps wasn't expired.  To those who give their dogs fish oil, does it really make them smell like that? He only had one cap and I didn't follow through anymore. Is this normal?  And ultimately, how do I get rid of this smell? "
2155,star trek cookbook pet food question,"In the star trek cookbook there's a cat food recipe under the data character entry, now my question is how effective is it as a homemade cat food? Would it work as dog food?    The recipe (Catfood #219, subroutine |DataSpot\Nancy|):     1 pound liver, kidneys, hearts, haggis or other organs      water to boil meat in      2 cups bran      2 cups old fashioned oatmeal or rolled oats      1/4 cup canola or other cooking oil        Boil meat in saucepan with water until cooked, cool, then mince/grind   up.      Mix in water used for boiling and other ingredients until you have a   dough like mixture.       Preheat oven to 250 degrees      Form kibble or bite sized biscuits from the dough.      Arrange biscuits on oiled baking sheet and bake for 3 hours      Turn off oven but leave sheet inside, then air-dry biscuits for   another 24 hours.    "
2156,How can I treat mosquito allergy in cats?,"I have two cats who have an allergy to mosquitoes. It creates scab-like sores on their noses and ears that bleed easily.  The vet gave me this stuff called Ovitrol to put on their heads with a cotton ball to keep the mosquitoes away but it's not working. I got rid of everything in the yard that could hold standing water and sprayed the area with repellent.  I want to take them back to the vet but I'd like to be armed with some options and information. Usually when my other cats have something like a flea allergy, they can be given a steroid shot to help the allergy clear up. Is this an option for them? I'm a little trepidatious of long-acting shots of late. Could they be put on an oral steroid to help?   Everything I find online talks about getting rid of the mosquitoes, and not how to treat the allergy. Looking for people who've had more experience with this. Thanks. "
2157,My cat won't play,"I recently adopted a cat, she's five years old, polydactyl, fixed and declawed. My question is, why won't she play and how could I get her to? Also, she sometimes chews on her toe pads, almost like they're bothering her, why does she do that? "
2158,How do I make a cat understand something is wrong?,"I'm currently trying to sleep after my 3 month old kitten broke one of my favorite frames into pieces. He knows he's not supposed to be on that shelf. I've consistently forbidden him, never let him reach it, said ""no"" countless times, put him on the floor if he even reached with his front paws, which he did a couple times, after seeing a shiny bracelet that caught his attention, but he didn't show that much interest besides that. Yet, it didn't matter. And I saw him do it. It was not an accident, he didn't simply bumped it aside. He deliberately pushed it off the shelf with his paw and watched it fall and explode on the floor. He's been here for almost 2 months. This came out of the blue.  I've had a cat for 16 and a half years before. She never did such things, so I'm desperate. My aunt has 6 cats and they never do this sort of thing. I've listened to her advice about being firm, consistent, etc. Doesn't make a difference.  He also spent the whole day throwing a book and a pair of glasses on the floor from the bedside table every second I turned around. If I looked at him, he would sometimes run guilty, but sometimes he'd just completely ignore my warnings and keep conscientiously misbehaving.  He doesn't respond to blowing on his face, touching his nose, and even if I pick him up to put him on the floor, he bites so fast and hard, it barely gives me a chance. He often play bites, too, at least I think that's his point half the time I reach my hand to pet him. I take my hand away, tell him not to do it, even removed myself from his presence. It doesn't work. Many times I am not even interacting with him, and he runs to me or my boyfriend and bites. It's OK when I can get away, but when we're laying down to sleep and he runs at our arms and fingers, it hurts.  People have referred to lemon helping to keep them away from places. Zero effectiveness with my cat. He likes lemon. Everything people told me to do, and everything I read about, he either likes it instead of being displeased, or is not affected whatsoever.  I do not understand. I always treated him kindly, he eats good food, his litter box is cleaned everyday and changed regularly, too, we play with him, we love him and show it, I just don't understand what else to do.  He's so tiny and cute and sweet to us when he's calm. He lets us pet him everywhere, pick him up, kiss him wherever we want. Heck, I can have my nose on him if I want to, we just sync and chill.  Why is he so double-sided? What could I be doing wrong? "
2159,How to setup a planted aquarium,"I have a 4 feet by 6 feet hole newly introduced on one of my walls. This wall in particular, separates the foyer and the drawing rooms in my house. I have mentally worked out a plan to use this hole for a couple of needs, such as placing my TV, and some books may be. Now, I have a left out space of 3.5 feet by 3 feet (thickness of the wall is 1 feet including the projection slabs) where I think it is appropriate to place a planted aquarium. Here is a representational image of what I'm planning to do. The blue box is the proposed aquarium.    Notice that, there will be view from both sides of the aquarium.    Here is the view from the other angle.    The approximate measurement of the aquarium will be 106h X 95w X 30d (all in centimetres).  I have no experience whatsoever in this domain. So I would like expert opinion on the following questions.  My Questions   How viable is such a project? (Alternate opinions also welcome) Is it possible to build this tank leak proof and without additional structural support given the large height requirement? How difficult and practical it is to build a double sided aquarium? How costly this project will be approx? (I'm living in India) My plan is to put very tiny fishes, in small numbers (like 3-4 guppies). What species should I look for?  "
2160,My dog won't eat his kibble unless I'm sitting right there?,"I don't have to hand feed him and he is not starving himself. I'm just curios, if I put his food in his bowl and leave the room, he won't eat until I return and he knows I'm not leaving? I'm curios on how to fix this?  I do have my roommates dog with me all the time but have to feed them separately. Until we work out their issues. So when I put my dogs food down and leave to go put the other dogs food down, neither will eat unless I'm in the room. But my roommates other dog will eat no problem? It's frustrating! I just want them to eat. I can't be in 2 places at once? Maybe a cage will help.  I'm sorry my dog is a 1 yr old male unnuetered pitbull, bull mastiff, lab mix, my roommates dog that's always with me is a 5 yr old male, nuetered, cavishon, a Kings Charles Spanish, b ishon mix, and the other dog is a 10 yr old male nuetered golden retriever lab mix.

2161,"My Black Cat (Named Ki-Ki), won't eat cat food anymore!","When we adopted our black cat Ki-Ki, he would eat cat food just fine when he was little. 2-3 years later he wants me to feed him only human food because we sometimes gave him scraps of meat we cooked. Could this be the reason? Has he gotten addicted to human food and not like cat food anymore? The only time he eats cat food is when I am in there with him, as if he doesn't like to be left alone. What is happening to Ki-Ki?? "
2162,How can I help a cat who seems afraid of his harness?,"TL;DR My cat panics when I try to put him in a harness and I'm not sure if he's just afraid of his harness or if I'm doing something wrong. Are there any tips on buying cat harnesses? Is there something I can do to make him more comfortable with the harness?  Some background:  My aunt has a dog and a cat and, when she leaves on business trips, she brings them to my place and I look after them. I have a hedgehog and the dog is (rightfully) skeptical about bugging her after he got too close to her. The cat is curious, but knows not to bug her. So I'd say they all get along, essentially. I have to walk the dog every day, and the cat always tries to get out around the time that I go to take the dog out.  I can get the cat to come back (he's pretty obedient, despite being a troublemaker), but he seems to get lonely if the dog isn't around with him. He tends to misbehave when I leave to take the dog on walks (scratches furniture, meows a lot so the neighbors complain, disturbs my hedgehog to the n-th degree) whereas if I go to work and come back, he's usually pretty good (plays with toys, sleeps, leaves my hedgehog alone). My aunt is going away for a little longer than usual, and my apartment neighbors are normally lenient about the cat when my aunt leaves for a week or so, but I can't subject them to constant meowing for a month.   Furthermore, my hedgehog is used to quiet and dislikes when a shadow lurks overhead, like most hedgehogs do. The cat makes a lot of noise and jumps on her enclosure very often when left alone. If this were to happen continuously for a month, I think my hedgehog would get sick from stress. I do usually move her out of the living room and into the bedroom when the cat is around, but she still gets pretty stressed from the cat meowing more (and louder) than usual. Also the door doesn't lock, so the cat can still get into the bedroom. In my eyes, leaving the cat at home is not an option.  This summer, my aunt is leaving her cat and dog with me for a few months (she says it could extend into next year) and is going to be living out of the country, although not permanently. I'm pretty sure I should be dealing with this problem now, so I figured the best thing to do is learn to walk the cat. I'm looking after them now while my aunt is out of the state, and I've bought everything I need to start walking the cat.  I'm having difficulty, though, since I can't get him on a leash/harness. He does want to go outside, and if we're just in my yard he's pretty much safe, but he tends to get fussy when I use a leash/harness. Usually I can get him to do pretty much anything, but he hates this for some reason. He only put it on once without complaining and since then he's been a nightmare. I thought it might be too tight and brought him to the pet store to have them check, but they determined it was a good size and let me swap out for a set made of a different material after the ordeal we went through trying to get the harness on him. (They thought the material was itching him.) It isn't working. Surprisingly, he doesn't seem to be too upset with me even though I'm usually the one subjecting him to this.  Right now, I take the cat in a cat carrier while I walk the dog and I've been going to a park with fewer dogs in preparation for when the cat is ready to walk on a leash. I could probably keep that up, but he's miserable whenever he's in the cat carrier. How can I make him less frightened of his harness? Is there something I should be considering when looking for one outside of just the size and material? "
2163,Can cats see optical illusions the same way we can?,"After seeing this gif I am curious to if cats can see optical illusions in the same way humans can.  The image on the paper the cat is pouncing on appears as though it is moving to us. And things that move seem to attract cats' attention. So this makes me wonder if the cat also views the image as moving.  Do cats perceive things like optical illusions the same as we do?  If so, do other animals, like dogs, see things the same as well? "
2164,Does my puppy have the hiccups?,"I was worried  when my puppy started to have these strange shaky movements, as shown in this video.  It seems to have stopped at this point.  Does he just have the hiccups? Is this usual for dogs or puppies? "
2165,Are there any effective non-toxic methods of controlling parasites in dogs?,"The veterinary pharmaceutical industry appears to be very keen that I expose my dog to toxins on a regular basis in order to prevent parasites taking hold.  I have heard that there are more natural alternatives, such as both feeding and dusting her coat with diatomaceous earth and/or garlic&mdash;especially when combined with periodic stool analysis.   Is there any basis to these claims? Have the effectiveness of these (or any other) ""natural"" solutions been researched scientifically? Have the methods of action been identified? Have any harmful side-effects been noted?  "

2168,Leg injury confusing the vet,"My doberman puppy (10 weeks) hurt his leg playing on the stairs a couple weeks ago. The vet said no hurry for bringing him in, since large dog breeds pull muscles all the time.  When we got him in, the vet took an x-ray and showed us what looked like a fracture, but with some weird swirling patterns around it that she has never seen before, and didn't know what to make of. We let her take another x-ray. She still has no clue.   Possibilities she has thrown at us go all the way from bone cyst that would require removal of the leg-bone to an old fracture (perhaps right around birth?) with the swirling indicating remodeling of the fracture, which my pup subsequently aggravated. It's been about a week since the visit, and he has a supportive wrap on his leg that lets him put pressure on it and walk around.   I swear I can't let him out to pee or eat without him doing his best to tear around the house. He doesn't appear to be sick or in any pain, and I think he is actually bouncier and more energetic than our great dane pup (1 year now) ever was. Nothing but nap-time is keeping him from playing.  If he had never gotten the xray, I wouldn't be concerned about him right now AT ALL, assuming he could use his leg without the cast. (He was starting to walk on it, gently, right before he went to the vet).  Now the vet wants to take a couple more xrays([tex]) test for valley fever([tex]) and some other stuff, too. We have spent close to $700 on this pup in the last month, a couple hundred more on the dane, had to put down a cat with an incurable virus infection, and we are raising 4 children. The money just isn't there for all of this.  What are things we should focus on, since I can't afford to focus on everything? "
2169,"Why do my clothes acquire a bad ""dog smell"" after laying in the wardrobe for a long time?","We proudly own a 3 year-old mix of Labrador and golden retriever. We care about her, and regularly wash her using the appropriate shampoo for dogs.  The dog itself never has any kind of unpleasant smell on her fur. She loses a lot of fur, but not more than average for her breed(s). Still though, we've noticed that some of the clothes hanging bit longer in the wardrobe will start accumulating a dog odor.  What causes this odor and how can I remove it? It's not somehow connected with her health, is it? "
2170,Do miniature cows with cat like agility exist?,"Do miniature cows exist which can be taken as a pet in home? Ideally they should be genetically improvised to have the agility and enthusiasm of a cat. It may sound impossible but I imagine it to be realistic,So does such a miniature pet cow exist or can it be bred? "
2171,Is it normal for dogs to have slightly congested breathing?,"For a little while now I have noticed that my (8 month old) puppy often doesn't breathe entirely cleanly.  It's most noticeable when she's relaxed and being petted (but not so much when she's asleep).  It isn't congested to the point that she's unable to breathe through her nose, but one can hear mucous being sucked down as she inhales.  Occasionally one can also see a small amount of nasal discharge.  I raised this with my vet, but predictably the puppy wasn't exhibiting any signs at the time: he listened to her lungs with a stethoscope and couldn't hear anything wrong, so was fairly unconcerned and dismissed my report as likely to be attributable to a canine cold or heyfever (reminding me in the process that puppies, like babies, are still acquiring immunity against common infections).  That all sounds plausible enough, but the fact that it has persevered for so long without any improvement is beginning to make me wonder whether something else could be to blame.   Is it normal for dogs to breathe like this when they're relaxed (and I've simply never before noticed it in other people's pets)? If not normal, how long should it take for a viral infection to clear in a young, but otherwise healthy, puppy? If not normal and ""chronic"" (by virtue of not having cleared by the time that it should), does it warrant further investigation given that it doesn't appear to be causing her any particular harm?  I suppose it could indicate a problem with her immune system, or even be a sign of some more serious ENT issue: but I'm not inclined to put her through a whole load of unnecessary tests.  "
2172,Would our indoor cat be less demanding if we could let her outside?,"We live together with a cat in a flat in the second floor (one above the ground). She has been an indoor cat all the time so far. When she was at my girlfriend's parent's house she could have gone outside, but did not want to.  Now in the flat, she tries to get onto the balcony when I am doing laundry or so. Once I am back in, she will sit in front of the glass balcony door and meow. I have the impression that she wants to go out. A couple of weeks ago, she started to go onto the balcony, and we watched her. She just sat under the dryer and looked around. A couple of days ago she slipped through the railing onto the neighbor's balcony and went a bit into their flat. Today, I was putting up clothes and she darted from the flat onto the balcony and through the railing. Luckily, the other door was closed, but it took a while until she came back.  My girlfriend is very worried that she might harm herself somewhere, and we are not really sure how the cat would get outside and inside from the second floor anyway. The ground is just some 2.50 meters down, so I guess she could get up with some sort of rope or ladder if she really wanted. We live rather close to the city, so there are some larger roads in reach.  She often wakes up from dozing in another room and meows continuously until she is in the other room and I pet her a bit. Often, she will come close to me and meow in a demanding tone, then behave like “pet me, but don't touch me!”. I do think that she might feel a little bored since there are no other cats around and she does not care for any toys, except a laser pointer which I do not want to use.  Would you think that it would be good for her to go outside on her own or on a leash? Or would that confuse her in a way that would be negative overall? "
2173,How do I stop my Shiba puppy from screaming at the top of his lungs everyday at 6am?,"How do I stop by Shiba puppy from screaming at the top of his lungs everyday at 6am, both in the short term and in the long term?  He is currently being crated at night and for a few hours during the day.  He screams for 10 minutes or so whenever we put him in the crate as well, or when he hears us come home.  We try our best to completely ignore him until he stops, which we know will / should help in the long run.  However, we live in a townhouse so we also just can't let him wail all morning, out of respect for our neighbors. Also, it would be nice if my wife and I could keep our own sanity.    What can we do to prevent this? "
2174,Do I need to trim a rabbit's nails?,"I know that I have to clip my cat's nails every now and again, and that got me wondering about my sister's rabbit - does its nails have to be clipped as well? Can we use the same style of nail clippers on the rabbit as she has for her cat?   For reference, the cat's nail clippers look like this:    "
2175,Are there specific vegetables I should not be feeding a rabbit?,"My sister's rabbit is given a variety of vegetables (carrots, peppers, lettuce (not iceberg), and so on). Basically, my sister gets whatever is available, and gives the rabbit bits of whatever we have for fresh vegetables.  Are there any vegetables we should avoid giving the rabbit? Or is anything fair game? "
2176,At what age can/should a baby rabbit (kit) be separated from its mother?,"I know that rabbit gestation is 28 - 31 days, and that the mother can get pregnant immediately after birth. Does that mean baby rabbits can be weaned when they are 4 weeks old?    Assuming the mother is not having another litter at the 4 week point, when is the best (mean/median) time to wean the kits?  What is the longest that kits should be left with their mom?  "
2177,How to correctly clean my dog's ears?,"My young Brittany has the inner part of his ears getting dirty quite easily.  It is not smelling badly and there is no pus. So I think they just need routine care.  When should I decide that they need to be cleaned? What is the correct way to clean them?  I fear that if done incorrectly it could ""push stuff further inside"" and that could lead to infection... "
2178,Do white cats prefer to hang out on light-colored objects?,"We've only had black cats and our past and present cats seem to like to hang out on dark-colored objects (e.g. navy blankets, gray sweatshirts, etc.). They are often difficult to see there and we always assumed that was their intent. But we're wondering how true that is. Do cats seek out spots that make them harder to see? In particular, do they choose areas that match their coats, indicating knowledge of their own coloring? For example, do white cats prefer to hang out on light-colored objects? "
2179,How do I stop my cat from peeing on rugs and linens?,"We have two cats who are litter trained, but one of them occasionally pees on rugs or linens instead. According to my fiancée, the cat was accidentally toilet trained on a towel as a kitten, and now she likes to pee on towels and similar things like rugs and blankets. While she did manage to re-train the cat to use litter, the cat will revert to peeing on linens occasionally, especially in times of stress. How can we reinforce the cat’s litter training and discourage peeing on rugs and linens?  Note that we have already removed most of the rugs from the house, so the cat doesn’t have many opportunities to pee on them. However, the bathroom is becoming a problem, as we need towels or rugs on the floor while bathing, and the cat has peed on them twice this week. Strangely, the cat seems to leave the kitchen floor mats alone – I don’t know what’s different about those.  Likewise, we keep the bedroom door shut when we’re not in it, so that the cat can’t pee on the bed. Unfortunately, that’s getting to be a problem too, as the cats will sometimes hide in the bedroom so that we can’t shut them out of it. This all would be much easier if we could just trust the cats not to pee on fabric – especially because the whole house has hard floors, and it’s more comfortable with rugs.  I don’t know whether this is relevant, but the cat has done this right in front of me several times. Unfortunately, I know just enough to recognize when the cat is about to pee but now how to stop it. I grew up with dogs and know how to shoo them before they pee, but it doesn’t seem to faze this cat.  Related: “How can stop my adult cat from urinating in inappropriate places?” but in this case, the behavior is not new, and the cat was accidentally trained to pee in the inappropriate place. "
2180,Reasons of aggressive cat and even not playing at all!,"My cat is around 2 years old. Its Persian male cat. He has no any partner.  I don't know what's the problem with it! It is not playing at all, also it is not responding to my voice (except there is something which he really wants like food, opening door when he wants to go outside). Also, it is very aggressive when we try to play with him, few times he has attacked me with a horrible voice. I was so scared.!  How can I help him to get normal again? And what can be the causes for such problem? He is with me even when he was 3 weeks old!   Do I need to spend more time with him? Or he really needs a partner? Or he wants to go out? Or he is bored from me and even don't want to be with me?   :( or there is some other issue with him?   Your help will be highly appreciable "
2181,"My cat recently bit me, what should we do?","When I am watching TV or walking in my house, she jumps up and bites me. I locked her in the cage as punishment. But after I release her, she is still doing the same thing. Why does she like biting people? What should I do? "
2182,Moving dog from warm to cold climate,We recently adopted a rescue dog from Houston and we live in Colorado. He's never experienced a cold winter and for sure not one like Colorado gets. Given that adopted him so close to winter will his body know to adjust and develop his winter coat?  Or will that be a change that happens next year after he's adapted to living in Colorado?  Thanks! 
2183,How do dog daycares/hotels protect from pests?,"Clearly, animal shelters inspect dogs before taking them in. I also imagine there being quarantine areas for newcomers.  How do smaller for profit doggie hotels/day cares or grooming shops deal with this? Some of these can be pretty posh and I don't imagine well off customers would tolerate getting back a flea infested dog. However, if there are multiple dogs on the premises, one of them could easily bring in such pests. Or is the detection rate of an experienced handler good enough to rule out such problems?  I know that especially dogs from wealthy families are unlikely to have such issues, because they will likely be given preventive treatment (collars, powder etc). I just want to know how business owners protect themselves from an irresponsible minority of dog owners. "
2184,Should I be allowing my kitten to bite my fingers?,"I have a ~5 week old male kitten. I've been raising him well and he gets a lot of attention. He purrs every time someone touches him and is a generally happy kitten. However, I am wondering if I should be allowing him biting my fingers. He enjoys a 'game' where he lays on his back and I tickle his stomach and he tries to grab my fingers (with his claws extended) and if he succeeds he ends up biting them. He is definitely aware that this could potentially hurt, as he never extends his claws nor bites my face, even when touching it, but he does do so with my fingers. It doesn't really hurt since his teeth are only just growing in, but should I be stopping him from doing this? Will this lead to a bad habit, and leading him to potentially painfully bite people/me when he is older and has stronger teeth? If so, how do I show him this is not ok? "
2185,Is it ok for persian cat to go to home yard,"We have a Persian cat who is free to go out into our yard:  Two days ago when he was out there, I heard some sounds from afar and saw another cat with smaller body size than him. When I reached them I saw that the other cat was in this position:    I was afraid of a fight between them and try to shoo the other cat, but it went to another corner of the yard and again mine followed it. Its position was similar to the above, so this time I tried to scare the other cat and it ran away.  I'd like what is the reason for this kind of interaction?  Is it better to let him go outside (any time in the day or in some specific times)?  Is it possible my cat (boy) could find a girlfriend by himself in this contact, if yes, what months are better? "
2186,Can a cat get FIV from a fight wound?,"My cat came last night with some blood stains on his jaw and head, apparently been injured during a cat fight. Since then he has not eaten and just curled at his bed. I'm wondering what is the worst case scenario? How likely is it that he's got FIV from the wound? "
2187,Aeration of fish tank,"Should I keep the air pump of my fish tank on , all the time? What is the rate of  oxygen absorption in water  at 25 degree Celsius? I have a primitive type of aeration system where a thin tube is  suspended in water with its other end to the motor. "
2188,Can I accidentally brush my cat too much?,"Is it possible to brush a cat too much, trying to remove the loose hairs? Can I overdo it and brush a cat so much that it gets bald or bald spots?  Lots of loose hair is always coming out of the fur of my cats especially with change of seasons.  According to the vet my cats are European shorthair and I have no reason to doubt that, but their fur is pretty thick in comparison to the neighbor's European shorthair cat. "
2189,Nervous about my male cats neutering procedure,"I'm hoping to get an appointment to get my one year old boy done this week... as he has started targeting his little 2 month old sisters that live in the same apartment block... Not nice.   I'm feeling anxious about not being able to feed him the night before the op. I've read online that they need to stop eating by midnight the night before, but my Vet is telling me that we have to stop feeding him by 6pm of the day before! A totally different and very stressful scenario from the midnight one. Who is right? the 500 articles on the internet or my Vet? I can't get a second opinion... I live in a small developing country and it's this centre or nothing.   Will my boy be traumatized by the waiting period? I know that even if I make an appointment for 9am, and they take him into the waiting cages, it may be an hour or so before he gets seen to and I may not be allowed to be with him. I know after the op he will either wake up at home... or wake up back in the cages but too groggy to comprehend where he is... regardless I've got it in my head he will be so traumatized that even when I bring him home he may not be able to recognise he is home and safe and will try and flee. It sounds ridiculous when I say it out loud but I don't know what to expect.   Should I take time off work for his recovery period? If for example I collect him at 4pm of the day he's had the surgery... should I not go in to work the next day?  "
2190,How should I acclimate a puppy to the playing of a musical instrument,"My son plays the saxophone and practices every night. The sound of a live instrument playing solo in the house is far different from having the radio on--it has much more resonance.  My best idea so far would be to have my son give the pup a rawhide (so her mouth is busy and less likely to bark) and keep an eye on her while softly playing scales for a few minutes, then remove the rawhide after he was done playing, so that the playing was associated with the rawhide fun and keeping the mouth busy. Then he could slowly work up the time and volume.  Are there better ideas or any direct experience with this kind of situation? Would it be best to start with low scales? "
2191,Other than fire what concerns are there from sweating hay?,"When hay is too moist/wet/green and baled or stacked tightly it can heat up and cause fires (Don’t let your hay profits go up in smoke, Michigan State University) there are multiple reference to this on the web. I know that warm, moist, oxygen free can lead to botulism growth but I am not sure what the moisture and temp required are leading to this growth.   Looking around the web the major concern I see from sweating hay is fire, in fact I really have not found any other documented concerns, but I remain personally concerned.   Other than fire what health concerns are there from sweating hay? If there are concerns, what means of mitigation can/should be taken?   My Scenario A couple of weeks ago, purchased 25 bales, 1st cut timothy hay within a day or so of it being baled. placed in my enclosed 5x8 utility trailer with two 4 inch vents. All bales seemed dry when loaded.  The weather here in Pittsburgh has been hot and humid. Opened the trailer to grab a bale of hay and the outside was moist, there was condensation on the roof of the trailer.  Put my hand in several bales of hay and all were just a bit warmer then the air, and still dry inside. The hay was discarded out of caution and new hay was purchased.   Clarify I am feeding house rabbits.   "
2192,Neutered male cat still trying to mate?,"Our 8 month old male cat was neutered this morning. Back at home after surgery, still slightly groggy, he immediately attempted to mate with his mother, at least 3 times within an hour.   Why would he do that when he is in pain and drugged? I thought neutering was meant to immediately quell that desire? "
2193,Repetitive Paw Licking,"My wife and I adopted a wonderful 5 year old female Pitbull about a year ago. Shortly after we got her she started licking her paws, not just normal cleaning of the paws but repetitive licking until the pads are all bloody and she cannot walk on them without limping. I clean and bandage them and she leaves them alone, lets them heal and does it again. To be clear, it isn't just one paw, it's all of them.    I contacted the dogs previous owner and asked her if she had ever experienced anything like this, she said no, and of course I just have to take her word for it...  The dog has been to the vet numerous times, even to different vets.   The first vet said she had food allergies and suggested putting her on a grain free food.  The second vet said she had skin and food allergies and suggested adding Claratin, she also said the dog had a yeast infection in her paws and put her on steroids for 60 days.    I've changed her food to a grain free salmon recipe, put her on the claratin, gave her the steroids and she still won't stop licking.  So my questions are this, what else could be causing the licking? Is there anything I can to stop this destructive behavior?    Notes:   We live in an apartment, all the grass is watered by a sprinkler system and I do not believe any fertilizers are being used. She is up to date on all of her shots She gets monthly FrontLine flea treatments, bought from the vet not online vendors. I've tried deterring her with rawhides and kong bones, she isn't interested.

2194,My turtle is pregnant what do I do?,"I recently got a turtle at the pet store for free because she is to large to fit in their tank after someone left her there. (8 inch shell length) A few days later after we had her She layed an egg and a couple hours later accidentally cracked it, so we had to throw it out. She has not layed an egg since and its been a day, should I be worried? And, we placed her in the bathtub with half water and half sand about 2-3 inch and don't have space for more and right now sand is all we have, and I want her to lay her eggs so she wont die from infection or so, what do I do?  "
2195,"As a cat person, how to coexist with a ""misbehaving"" dog?","TLDR; I've tried for a year to coexist with my girlfriend's dog, and things have gotten better, but it's still not liveable for me. Is there anything else I can do?    My girlfriend and I moved in together a little under a year ago, and alongside her came her Pomeranian and two cats (in addition to my own cat). I've had a lot of difficulty adjusting to this dog over the past year - especially only ever having kept cats in the past - but we've put a lot of elbow grease into making things better, and have made a lot of progress.  The problem I'm facing now is that, even with remarkable behavior improvements and a year to get acclimated, I'm still having a lot of trouble coexisting with this dog - and I'm worried we're running out of options to make the situation any better.  First, things that have gotten better:   At first, he was an incorrigible barker (as Pomeranians are), literally setting off any time he heard a leaf drop outside. Daily chasing of cats, jumping on the table to steal food off plates, barking for attention whenever we leave the room, snapping at anyone that tried to touch his bed while he was laying in it. After some in-home training classes, a few months of positive reinforcement, and the purchase of a remote-controlled citronella collar, most of this behavior has subsided. Mostly. Part of the problem was my own behavior as well; I learned quickly that you can't admonish a dog like you can a cat. A spritz from the squirt bottle doesn't deter them, it just makes them irritated and bark at you instead of that leaf. Training classes taught me how to get him to respond to me instead of just aggravating him.   Now, things I'm still having trouble with:   My girlfriend and I are sleeping in separate rooms because of the dog. He sets off anytime someone opens the door while he's sleeping and wakes him up, as a fear/alarm response. We've tried training him out of this, but he's overprotective of my girlfriend so we haven't had success - he's being stubborn about this one. We've tried putting him out in the hall, but he just ends up fighting with the cats, so this is the only peaceable solution for now. There are times I'm watching TV and idly petting, not paying attention to where my hand is going. This is safe behavior with cats - if you hit a spot they don't like, they just squirm and walk away. With the dog, if you hit a spot he doesn't like, he suddenly nips at your hand. He's never drawn blood, but it's always a rude surprise nonetheless. We admonish him when it happens, and have been giving him positive reinforcement when we pet him and he doesn't nip - but it doesn't seem to be stopping. We've also taken him to the vet to make sure there's no injury or skin irritation - it's just his way of saying ""stoppit!"". These are really the only ""good moments"" we share otherwise, so this one might be getting under my skin the most. Training commands can only go so far when they're reactive. He still chases the cats and snarls/barks at them, he just doesn't do it as frequently - and we can stop him a lot sooner. There's still the hackle-raising stress when he sets off. There are also still mornings that he barks when my girlfriend gets up to get ready for work - which is a problem because she gets up considerably earlier than me. He responds quickly when she uses his ""quiet"" command, but still - all it takes is one bark to wake me up. After months of a 6am wake-up call when my alarm is set for 8am, I'm going batty.   I'm not sure what else to do. Neither of us are willing to get rid of him - for better or worse, he's a member of the family. We seem to have hit a wall in terms of how much we can fix, and none of the resources we've tried have been able to push us past it. The lack of further solutions over the past few months has me in despair - something has got to give, and as it stands it's going to be our relationship.  Is there anything else I can do, to improve his behavior (or mine)? I'm at the end of my rope. "
2196,"Cat suddenly peeing inside, usually goes outside somewhere, and is skitterish around us","Our 5 year old Female cat, Oreo, has suddenly become afraid of us and will run and hide behind the couch when we come into the room. She is normally friendly and wouldn't do this. She isn't aggressive when you try to pet her, she just tries hiding from, and avoiding your hand. I'm unaware of any of us accidentally hurting her or scaring her.   I've also noticed that she has started urinating inside when she would normally go toilet outside in the garden somewhere. She would scratch at the door to let us know she wants to go outside. She doesn't meow to be let in anymore either.  What's going on? Should we take her to the vet?  Any help would be much appreciated. "
2197,How can I make my barfy dog feel better? (Gross detail warning),"Three times in the last week, our dog has vomited unexpectedly (ie. we weren't driving and he hadn't been eating grass) and each time it has been bright (bright) yellow and slightly liquid/foamy. I haven't changed his diet at all, and I'm definitely not embarking on any vegan diet experiments, but the answers to Dog vomiting yellow/white foam since being fed vegan food seem to suggest this is acid reflux.   Today, he was trying really hard to get my attention and I was trying really hard to work and eventually he deposited some diarrhea on the bathroom rug (not a bad place, cleanup was straightforward, if foul) and then when I realized what was up and took him out he threw up within a block of our house and then dragged me to a grassy median a few blocks away and worked really hard to squeeze out some more dribbles of diarrhea.   Since then, he hasn't been eating or drinking. His nose is dry and he looks miserable and he won't play with me. It's been a few hours.  I'm not sure what might be going on. The only thing that has changed in his diet is that we have been giving him some chicken hearts sometimes for treats. I think my husband gives him more than I do -- I chop them pretty small. But we've had them for several weeks (they're cooked and frozen, we thaw one or two at a time and chop them up) and he only started throwing up in the last few days.   Is there anything I can do for him to make him feel better now? I've used pumpkin for soft stools in the past. I don't want to start giving him a bunch of new food that's just going to end up making him sicker, but if there's something I can do to help him feel better I'd like to do it.   Should I give him some squash? Or leave him be for now?   UPDATE: He's fine. He was so energetic on his night time walk that it didn't seem necessary to take him to the vet. I'd still be interested in knowing more about how to tell when vomiting is severe enough to warrant veterinary care, however, and whether there are foods that are better or worse for a dog with an upset digestive tract.    He had another bout of diarrhea on July 8, and again this week, July 22. Two weeks apart to the day. The timing still seems bizarro, but on our vet's advice we took his food away for the night and gave him only rice.   Still seeing how this plays out.  "
2198,"How do I give a cat *with a cone* liquid medication, by myself?","My cat just got spayed. She has a head cone on. She has fresh sutures on her belly. She is a fighter, and she is clearly mad about this whole thing. I have to give her 1cc of antibiotics (amoxicillin) in a syringe twice a day. Also I live alone, and I can't call somebody to come over to help me twice a day every day for the next two weeks, that's not feasible.  I can't do it. It's simply not happening. I struggled for an hour this morning and got nowhere.  I read How do I give my cat oral (liquid) medicine?. I watched [website]I tried wrapping her in a towel. Looks easy in pictures, except my body does not contort in the way necessary to keep her from moving. I tried wrapping her in a towel, then using my left hand I guess... I grabbed the front of the towel to keep it tight around her body then leaned in to trap her between my chest and my elbow, but then I can't keep her head still.  I tried tightening the towel then awkwardly leaning on the towel itself to hold it closed, while using one hand to sort of reach into the cone and grab her cheeks, but she backs up and my body isn't constraining enough to keep her from slipping into the towel.  She's the softest cat I have ever met and has zero friction against the towel, which is making this even more difficult.  No matter how tight I have the towel her front paws have a way of... almost squirting (lol) out the front of the towel and directly into my exposed skin. I put on a long sleeve shirt and tried again.  I can't grab her chin because she has a cone.  If I scruff her and hold her down I still can't keep her head still in the cone, and I can't use any spare fingers on my scruff hand to hold her head still because... the cone. And I don't have a third hand.   I tried holding her between my legs facing me, with one hand holding her down, and the other hand grabbing her head with thumb and index finger while somehow holding the syringe between pinky and ring finger, then using my chin to depress the plunger. That... didn't work. It might of, if I were a contortionist.   I tried sitting on the floor, with her between my legs facing me, my right leg flat on the floor but bent to keep her from going backwards; my left leg over top of her to keep her from jumping out, one hand on her face and the other hand coming over top of that hand with the syringe. I couldn't figure out how to make this work and gave up.    I tried with her facing away from me, on the floor, where I kneeled and tried to hold her between my knees, with my feet touching to keep her from going backwards, and one hand holding her head, but then the head holding hand gets in the way of the syringe because I have to reach in from the front because of the cone. Nothing makes sense.   I also don't want to be too rough with her underside, given that a surgeon yanked her ovaries out then sewed her back up less than 24 hours ago.  Plus she was terrified of the syringe right off the bat, and is really, really angry at the cone. I'm being gentle. I'm petting her. I'm talking to her softly. I'm doing everything I can to calm her down, and everything seems to go so well until the moment she sees the syringe.  I looked at the cone after reading the suggestions below to take it off. It's got a lot of plastic tabs to undo and after current struggles I'm not confident I could get it back on, so I am not going to attempt to remove it, even though I'm sure this is the way to go. A more easily removable cone would be nice; but it will take a few days for one to arrive unless I can find a vet with a nicer one.  I've also tried giving her canned food (half of a small can) with the liquid mixed in. She can't really eat it well with the cone on, though, and also doesn't seem to be into it (her normal diet is hard food). I can sort of convince her to eat it if I put it on a spoon and hold it out for her, but not enough to get her the full dose.  This appears to be impossible.   How do I do this? But like, really how do I do this? It's one thing to say ""wrap your cat in a towel and hold her still"" but keep in mind that I have a fairly typical human body with two legs that bend at the knees, two arms that bend at the elbows, and five normal length fingers on each hand with the standard set of knuckles. Plus the normal laws of physics apply.  "
2199,How do I know if my cat has worms?,"Are there any specific signs my cat will show if he has worms?  I know that horses can get diarrhea, loose weight or don't gain weight and that you can detect some of the worms in their fecal.  But as my cat always goes out to poop, it's difficult to test his fecal for worms or see if he has diarrhea or something like that.  Is there any other way to find out if I have to deworm him? "
2200,What should I monitor while changing my dog's diet?,"After some research on dogs nutrition I'm considering changing his diet from commercial dry kibble to home cooked food. I would do it progressively: kibble in the morning and home cooked chef's surprise in the evening.  There are obvious signs I would watch for: food avoidance, vomiting, serious change in behaviour.  What else should I check/log? Should I monitor his weight regularly?  The dog is a 7 months-old Brittany. "
2201,Restricting the duration of volunteers walking dog at a local shelter,"My local shelter accepts volunteers to walk the dogs. However they limit each walk to a maximum of 20 minutes.  I'm a bit puzzled by this limitation. Considering that shelter dogs generally live in a very stressful environment I think that this policy is quite bad for the dog: the dog experiences even more stress when getting ready for a walk as he knows it's going to be short. Even with no prior experience, imagine this: the dog is already under stress. He meets new people. He goes for a walk. After 10 minutes he has to turn back and go back to the shelter.  People walking a dog in view of adopting him will have no chance to see the dog in a ""normal"" state of excitement or stress.  Their argument is that this gives more chances to the dogs to be adopted: the dog can't be adopted if he's not in the shelter.  Are there studies about shelter dog adoption considering this problem? Or other sources suggesting that this could be beneficial/detrimental to the dog? "
2202,How can I tell whether adopting a second cat is a good idea?,"I have a 7-year-old female cat, adopted from the Humane Society last September. About a month ago we moved from a two-story house into a smaller one-bedroom condo. Perhaps because I brought a lot of familiar furniture, she seems not to be very anxious in this new place, but she's become rather inactive. She has perches to look out the windows, but there's not as interesting of a view as there was at the last place. She doesn't play with toys unless I'm controlling them, and even then she loses interest pretty quickly, and I'm not always home. She has also become pickier about her food and water - she won't eat dry food any more, and she doesn't drink water any more. I'm afraid that she's understimulated.  For this reason and others, I'm considering, in the near future, adopting a second cat. I understand that a young male cat would be the best choice in this situation. But I don't know whether my cat would actually get along with another cat. At the house we lived at previously, she and the neighbour's cat would sometimes fight at the window, and those are the only interactions between her and another cat that I've witnessed - but they were never properly introduced or anything like that, so I don't know that I can predict how she would interact with a new roommate based on that. I don't want to go and adopt another cat and have her hating me and the intruder forever...   My question is: are there any behavioural signs, that I can observe without having another cat around, that might indicate whether she could coexist with or even enjoy the company of another cat? Am I misguided in thinking in the first place that adopting a second cat could be a way to bring some life into her? "
2203,What causes a dog or a cat to shed?,"My Long haired cat sheds a lot. It's insane how much fur he loses, and yet there always seems to be more of it. It doesn't seem like it's tied to the season because he sheds during the winter too, but he's also inside all the time, so I can kind of understand that he wouldn't need more fur since he's not out in the cold.  On the other hand, I had a labrador as a kid who would shed tons in the spring. It seemed pretty clear that there was a winter coat of fur, and a summer coat. Which makes sense since she spent most of her time outside.  So what makes dogs and cats shed their fur? Is it defined by seasons, or are there other reasons? "
2204,I stopped giving my cat dry food for 4 days and after 4 days she started vomiting with dry food,"I adopted a cat a little over a month ago. She is one year old. At first, I bought a small bag of Purina Indoor dry cat food to make sure she liked it before buying a big bag. I also bought some Friskies cans of wet food. During the first month, she seemed to like the dry food and did not have any problems with it. When I ran out of the small bag, I gave her only wet food for about 4 days before I could go get a big bag of dry food since she seemed to like it. The cat has been vomiting since eating from the new bag. For the moment I just switched back to wet food while I figure this out. I read that cats have to get used to eating dry food if they spend time without it. Is 4 days enough to make a cat not being used to dry food? What could it be?  At first, she started leaving coin-sized poodles. I could not identify if they were vomit or from coughing up fur balls since the poodles were so small. I could also notice she was spending more time in the hunched up loaf position with her head down. For the next two days, I noticed she was not eating almost anything. Then, I saw her vomit a lot of bile and some undigested food. This was shortly after eating. Later that same day, she vomited a more solid chunk of semi-digested food. This was also relatively shortly after eating. Like a big log of paste with pieces of dry food. (I am just being specific since I read that different kinds of vomit mean different things with cats).  We are going to the vet just in case, but I am uneasy and wanted to know if I should be very worried.  I know it might not even be the food, but I have no idea what else might cause it. Since I stopped giving her dry food she seems to be acting normal and I have not seen any more vomit.  Thank you! "
2205,Dog may have eaten staples,"My dog may have eaten 3 or 4 staples, while playing. Is there any danger for its health? I think it will emit them, but in case it doesn't what are the possible effects in its mood? "
2206,How can I stop my dog from peeing on our neighbor's door?,"My dog in general is well behaved and only pees outdoors... Except in one case where the dog will pee if another dog had once peed there.   Because of this, about once every two months, when we go out to walk, my dog will pee on my neighbors door inside out appartment complex because long ago a dog came in and peed there. (Turns out the friend of someone else in the building brings another dog in once every two months....)  And yes, my dog is leashed, and I keep the leash as short as possible while going up the stairs.  The hallway and door are tiled . How can I get rid of the scent or retrain the dog that this spot is not allowed to be peed on?  Below is a picture of the door being peed on. Its on the top right of the stairs.  I read on one website that if I put food or dog treats on the spot, it will prevent the dog from peeing there because dogs won't mark where their food is? Would that actually work? How could I implement that in this situation?   "
2207,Language problem: what is tetra?,"I hope the question is valid for this group. Unfortunately, I am not English native speaker.  If someone refers to ""tetra"" what species do they have in mind?  Image search on Google gives many different results, also the list on ""tetra"" article from Wikipedia.  I'm asking because in that question it is not said (however the species name is not important in the question) "
2208,Why do dogs rub themselves in other dogs' feces?,"From time to time, and in what appear to be completely random intervals not apparently connected to any particular events, my dog decides to rub itself in other dogs' crap when I take it for a walk.  Is there a particular reason for dogs to do this? Also, (and aside from just pulling on its leash when I see it's about to happen) is there a way to prevent them from having this behaviour? I ask this second question because I have no idea what kind of instinct leads a dog to do this. "
2209,"Does this koi carp injury need attention, and how would I treat it?","We have a large koi carp (I would approximate 50cm long) that has an injury to its head — a gash which has left a triangular flap of flesh about 4cm wide. There is no sign of blood, and the inside of the gash is white. This injury occurred within the last 36 hours.  Photos are below, and if necessary, I have a video that I can attempt to upload if it provides a clearer visual.  My question is, does an injury of this type require medical attention? If so, how would one go about treating this wound?  (Consider me a complete newbie in fish care, as somebody else used to care for them.)     "
2210,Can I use any bulb in lighting my aquarium?,I have a 2watts led bulb and I am planning to use it as a lighting in my aquarium of volume 20 gal. My question will be can I use it without harming my fishes? And in general can I use any bulb as a lighting for my aquarium? Thanks a lot. 
2211,What do I look for in a good cattery?,What sorts of things should I look for in a cattery when I visit?  I have an old(er) cat who needs to go to a cattery for a week and I'm unsure as to what I should look for to tell me a place is good or bad. Are there decent review sites out there?  If it helps I am in the UK (Buckinghamshire). 
2212,What are the pet health concerns with using Diatomaceous Earth as an insecticide?,"A couple of answers (1 ,2) on flea treatments have suggested the user of Diatomaceous Earth (DE) for flea control.  I have heard there are possible health concerns for my pet.  Is there any evidence supporting health concerns in humans or pets with the use of DE for treating fleas? What dosage/application rate is documented as safe or unsafe? "
2213,What are the pet health considerations for selamectin for treating parasites?,Selamectin is a topical flea and other parasite treatment for pets.

2215,What are safe plants to let my cat chew on?,"Someone mentioned in an comment about my cat and his love of string that I should give him something else to chew on. They suggested oat grass, but are there other types of things I can let him eat?   If possible, I'd like to make a ""cat garden"" in my window, a sort of salad buffet of sorts I can offer to my cat. What sorts of plants are safe? "
2216,How much meat is enough for my dog?,My dog is a 5 years old schnauzer that weights approx 23lbs.  I usually give him 1.5-2 cups of dry dog food per day.  I would like to switch him to real food. I understand that the majority should be meat protein. How much oz of meat should I give him? And what should I mix in with the meat? (my dog is slightly allergic to chicken) 
2217,How can I stop my cat from eating plastic?,"One of my cats will eat anything that is soft plastic.  He will eat shopping bags, cellophane wrappers, anything.  Fortunately, he hasn't had any issues.  I've seen plastic in his poop, so when he eats it, at least it passes.  Once I heard him gagging somewhat in the middle of the night.  I got up and saw him with a couple inch strip of plastic hanging out of his mouth.  He was happily munching it down.  I grabbed it and started pulling it out of his mouth.  It was 3-4 feet long.  He had gotten into the trash and ate the cellophane wrapper from a large box.    I have gotten in the habit of making sure there is never any plastic around, but every once in a while he finds some.    How can I teach him not to eat plastic?  Also I want to know, what is causing my cat to eat plastic? "
2218,Is an Italian Greagle a quiet enough dog to have in an apartment?,"I recently heard about the mix/designer breed known as the Italian Greagle, an Italian Greyhound and Beagle mix.  They are very beautiful dogs, with the elegance of the Italian greyhound but with a slightly more filled out build.  My question is how much the Italian greyhound genes minimize the beagle's persistent vocalization?  In other words, are they quiet enough for apartment living or do they retain too much of the beagle genes? "
2219,My cat suddenly stopped using the litter-box to defecate,"I have read this question, but no answer seems to help here.  My cat is an eight-year-old neutered male, and I have had it for five years.  He has always used the litter box, but sometimes defecated outside of it (always just in front). I figured that he didn't like the box (too small), and fixed it years ago. Also, I did some tests with different types of litter to see which he was comfortable with (the one I currently have is really efficient at neutralizing the smell).  Until then, when he did defecate in front of his litter-box, it was always related to one of two causes:   He was not happy (we sometimes lock him up inside the bathroom when we clean up the flat; it is his way to say that he disapproved of it) Because the litter is dirty and/or smelled bad   But for the last month or so he refuses to use the box to defecate at all, even if the box is clean and the litter is new. He always defecates just in front of the box. Thankfully, urination has never been a problem.  I haven't changed the litter brand, the ""cleaning stuff"" brand, location of the box,  or anything that could have disrupted him. I know cats can easily be stressed by small environment changes, but I can't see anything that could have stressed him.  I don't think my cat is doing this out of anger, but what my cat does really look like a ""I show you I am not happy"" behavior. Maybe he is stressed when we lock him up and stress leads to this behavior?  I will bring my cat to a veterinarian next week if the problem isn't solved by then. I didn't do it yet, because ""health problem"" seems like an unlikely cause (apart from that, his behavior didn't change at all).  Except for unforeseen health problems, do you know of anything else that could bring a cat to change this kind of behavior? Can a cat suddenly not like a litter brand anymore, for example? "
2220,How do I introduce an orphaned kitten to a nursing mother cat?,"I have a nursing mother cat with 4 kittens, and I now I been brought an unrelated kitten that needs to nurse.    How can I get the nursing mother to accept the orphan, and nurse it?  Is the age difference of the orphan and natural kittens important for a successful adoption? "

2222,What common house/garden plants are dangerous to dogs and why?,"What common house/garden plants, if any, are dangerous to dogs and why are they? Are some potentially fatal? "
2223,How to introduce a large playful dog to a kitten,"This isn't quite the same situation as the question asked here: How can I introduce a cat into a household with dogs?  It's also not something that's happened to me. And - fair warning - this did not end well.  People I know found an abandoned kitten that was just barely old enough to be away from its mother. They have two large dogs. One of the dogs is very playful and does not understand ""small and fragile"".   They were keeping the kitten separated from the dogs to prevent accidents, but the kitten got out of the room when the dogs were around, and the playful dog accidentally killed the kitten (they had to supervise this dog closely when their child was a baby - the dog despite training has never managed to understand that it can break something small and delicate). They're devastated.   How could this tragedy have been prevented?  "
2224,How can I make my dog comfortable with riding in the elevator?,"We have a charming once-feral puppy. We've had him for two months and only just got him going on regular walks in the last week. (see How do I convince my dog that a collar or harness is not the end of the world? for more on that).  The thing is, he's absolutely terrified of our elevator. He sits in the corner shivering. I'd take the stairs but... well that's another issue. He hates them. Given the choice, he'll run to the elevator and then shake the whole ride.  I tend to say soothing things like ""you're a good dog."" and ""it's okay"" but I've read that I'm just reinforcing his fear. How should I handle his fear?  He has to go downstairs a few times a day, and I hate traumatizing him. Should I just ignore his fear and figure he'll get desensitized eventually? Or can I do something to make it easier on him? "
2225,Why won't my dog take the stairs?,"I've gotten some good reassurance here about our feral rescue shepherd. (See How do I convince my dog that a collar or harness is not the end of the world? for back story). We've finally worked out our slip lead technique and started taking him for regular walks. He's absolutely terrified of the elevator, but definitely prefers it to the stairs. After taking him up and down some staircases in the park, I decided the problem isn't the very concept of stairs -- he does just fine on them -- but something about ours in particular.  So I basically drag him to the stairs (+1 for polished tile hallways) and then he walks down them. He's slowly getting better about going down -- I don't have to drag him again around each bend (we're on the 5th floor) anymore, but he is having no part of going up the stairs.  Going down, I think self-preservation kicks in. He can either walk down like a normal mammal, or he's just going to fall. So he walks. But going up he just fights and fights. I don't want to push him too hard so I usually give up and take the elevator, but I don't like it. He hasn't shown any aggression in the elevator but I'm still not comfortable with other people getting on and off while he's shaking in the corner because I'm not confident he won't lash out. And plenty of people are scared of dogs. I don't want to ask someone with fear of dogs to share a confined space like that. So I'd really like to get him taking the stairs up and down.   Suggestions?

2226,Why has my turtle stopped eating carrots?,"I'm feeding my river turtle some carrots and in time it stopped eating them. Are there any reasons why, or things I should look out for? Will it affect my turtle's growth rate? "
2227,What can I do about my Pugs itchy red ears?,My pug is one year old and for the past year he has been getting itchy ears every once in a while. When I look into his ears they are red and sometimes hurt from all the scratching that he does. Is this normal? What can I do to get rid of this and prevent it from coming back? 
2228,Why does my cat reject half her food? Is it stale? How can I fix this?,"Why does my cat always leave behind food, and refuse to eat it later when combined with new food?  I'm not overfeeding...  I'm not giving my cat more than she can eat, but rather she seems adamant to leave behind her food.  After several days, she will end up with an oversupply of left-overs.   Its not the bowl or comfort issues...  I initially researched it, and I thought perhaps she did not like her wiskers touching the side of the bowl -- hence she would not eat from the fringes of the bowl.   Perhaps she is spoiled...  That was not the case. I tried bunching her food together to the middle of the bowl and topping it off with a very small amount of new food, perhaps ""tricking"" her into thinking the whole pile was new.   She seems to reject anything that was previously a left-over, and there is no tricking her.   It seems likely she is sensing something by smell that I am not fully grasping.   She is possibly making health decisions, and her food is not good in her eyes...  The food is ""Friskies"" and I had switched to fish-based ingredients when I was told her poultry-based food was causing a rash that she had (I had been inspecting it's cause for a year or so)  The only thing I can surmise, based on what I know of my cat, is she is instinctively rejecting portions of her food based on her own sensitivities.  But how do I know for sure? Is this common cat behavior?  I'd like to stop wasting food as well as get to the bottom of this issue.  An extra note...  My wife and I have a cute little feud over this. She says I spoil her, whereas I think the cat is probably having a real problem I don't understand. Yet on that ""spoiling"" level, if I ever cook fish she is extremely interested in our meal and begs a great deal. Of course I feed her the fish!  Spoiled kitty? Malnourished kitty?  Deranged kitty? "
2229,Can a stray dog be healthy on a diet of only milk?,What should I feed a stray dog? Currently he is fed milk twice a day.   Is this enough for him or does he need any other nutrients? 
2230,"Cat comes back after 4 days, meows loud, and wants to go back outside again","My cat (female) left us 4 days ago and didn't came until today. When she came back she was dirty, didn't want to be touched, didn't want to eat or drink even though it was very warm outside. After like 2 minutes with us, she started consistently meowing and giving us signs she want to go back outside again.  Is this normal? Is there something wrong with her? "
2231,Warm weather walkies and water,"With the warmer weather, the 'walkies duty' hasn't lifted. When going out for longer walks on hot days, I've been taking with me a bottle of water and a bowl.   But I thought I'd ask - what's your 'rule of thumb' of how far you're going before you'd consider taking a dog drink with you? I've tended to assume up to about an hour walking, and 30m running/playing. Is this too long? (On a warm day)  And are there any better solutions to taking a backpack with water and a (fold up) bowl with us?  "
2232,What is the real chance my 8-week puppy gets parvo?,"I have an 8-week old cocker spaniel - poodle mix. I'm told she's had her first parvo shot out of three.   I live in a relatively well-to-do neighborhood with very, very few stray dogs. We have a front yard and a back yard, with the backyard completely gated and dog-proof. The gate joins the house where the front and back yard meet, probably about forty feet between the sidewalk/road and that gate.  For a couple reasons, we really didn't want to let the puppy go to the bathroom in the backyard a few minutes ago (minutes-old tree spray, probably innocuous but playing it safe).   We got lucky and the puppy didn't want to go to the bathroom before the spray dried out (really super hot here). But if she had (because this will probably come up again): What is the real chance my puppy gets parvo if I had let her relieve on my front lawn? How common is it among dogs, and do more dogs come that far up on my lawn than I think? How much does that first shot do? "
2233,Cat pulls his claws off while being transported,"My cat hates the car and his travel box (plastic with wire mesh). He claws at the boxes air vents / grill and goes a bit crazy when we drive, which leads to pulled off claw sheaths and a bit of bleeding. How do I stop him from doing this? Is there any solution other than sedating him? "
2234,How can I keep my dog in my back yard?,"My sister has a Siberian Husky, and just moved into a rental home. Her previous home had a fenced backyard (6 foot privacy), but this home does not. How can she easily keep her dog in her yard?  They've used an overhead trolley on him before, and he didn't care for it. At the time, they had another dog and they would get tangled together, so that may have been part of the problem.  They're considering installing an invisible fence (the landlord will deduct improvements from the rent) but they aren't sure if it will be effective through his thick fur. What other options are available?  He was on a regular walking schedule for the 6 months they lived in my parents' basement, and once he settles down in the new home he should return to that fairly easily. In their previous home he enjoyed just hanging out outside sometimes, and they'd like to be able to allow him to do that. "
2235,How effective are cat/dog dental water additives?,"My mom swears by a water additive that claims to help with dental care (similar to Healthy Mouth, just a different brand).   They're not something I know a lot about, but I do know that my cat has some issues with tartar in his mouth and the like. I have tried brushing his teeth, but that is a very difficult process, and I was wondering if something like this would work instead.  Is it a viable alternative? Does it have actual benefits? Is it something I should be giving to my cat? "
2236,Should I be worried that my cat is making a huffing noise?,"I have a six year old diabetic Devon Rex cat.   Yesterday she was sleeping on the chair next to me. Suddenly she lifted her head and started making a strange huffing noise, almost like she was hyperventilating at an extremely fast pace. At times, she included a small noise that sounded a bit like a quack. She did it three times in a row, and each spell lasted about 15 seconds. Her eyes weren't showing signs of panic, and she looked calm throughout the entire thing and after, but it really freaked me out. Afterwards, she continues laying and looking serene, but continually licks her lips.  She's done this a few times now, but it scares us. She's always healthy other than the diabetes when we take her to the vet. She's never shown signs of allergies, and there's no pattern as to when it happens.  Why is she doing this? What is it? Should I be worried? "
2237,Kangkong (morning glories) as rabbit diet,"Since I got a rabbit a couple months ago, he's been eating mainly kangkong, a vegetable popular in Southeast Asia in the morning glory family. (It's also called ""water spinach,"" but it is not a Brassica.) Some research (1, 2) suggests that this food is alone suitable for raising healthy rabbits, but mine is a pet, not livestock.   He has never eaten any hay. When we go for walks, he likes to nibble on grass and random plants, but it's not a significant part of his diet. He seems healthy and active. There was some tooth decay, but it's gone away since I stopped feeding carrots and tomatoes. He eats his poop and then leaves hard pellets, which is supposed to signify good digestive health.  Today I finally found some hay. He sniffed it with curiosity, then turned it down.  Should I be concerned? Is there a longer-term risk? "
2238,"Is trancing due to fear, or vice versa?","My rabbit is virtually fearless. He does not run from cats or running cars, showing curiosity instead. (The one time he got up close and sniffed a cat, he did become startled and put a couple meters of distance from it. And he does hop away from moving cars, but not as fast as he could.)  Issues of outdoor protection aside, my question is about the physiology of trancing. (I've only done this to check his teeth, by the way.)  When he's upside-down, he'll kick for a couple seconds before he rolls his eyes and passes out. After I put him back, he seems none the worse for wear. He goes right back to his usual friendly self. I thought this was normal until I saw ""Can trancing a rabbit have cumulative negative effects?"":     The immediate side-effects of coming out of TI include things like increased respiration, heart rate, and plasma corticosterone (a steroid found in many animals).       …      the response after release is to escape and hide which, after all, is the purpose of TI in the first place   My bunny is certainly uncomfortable with being upside-down, but seemingly no more than if he's picked up awkwardly. As for the rest, he just gets really sluggish. Is this unusual? It seems to conflict with the common explanation of tonic immobility. "
