0,How do I calculate the inclination of an object with an amateur telescope?,"Suppose I would like to calculate the inclination of a satellite from the ecliptic. Would it be possible to do this with an amateur telescope? How would I go about doing so?    Note: A good answer should tell what kind of telescope an amateur would need, what measurements they would need to make, then what calculations they would have to perform to get the inclination (or the ""instantaneous angular measurement from the ecliptic at the time of measurement""). "
1,How are the compositional components of exoplanet atmospheres differentiated?,"How are exoplanetary atmosphere compositional spectra distinguished from those of the parent star(s), from the composition of the planetary surface or any other factor?  Is it actually possible to determine the atmospheric composition precisely using this method?  Are there any specific examples of such an analysis having been performed on an exoplanet? "
2,Why can't light escape from a black hole?,"I've heard that light can't escape from a black hole. Can it? If not, why? "
3,Are astronomers researching or trying to find signs of worm holes?,"In many movies and in the popular culture wormholes are often referenced, as well as ""faster than light travel"", which seems almost to be the same thing, is possible.  Are astronomers seriously considering and researching this phenomenon? What could be the signature of wormholes? Would next generations telescopes as ELT able to detect such signatures? "
4,"Can ""dark matter"" be the additional mass from the speed of the Galactic Cluster?","Considering that the Earth orbits the Sun at 100 000 km/h and that the Sun orbits the Milky Way at almost 1 000 000 km/h, could it be possible that the galactic cluster orbits some super cluster at speeds approaching 1 000 000 000 km/h?   If it did, how would that affect the mass of the cluster and how would we know or be able to measure it?   Can you show any calculations to prove that this additional mass is not in line with what's measured for ""Dark Matter""?  "
5,Why is only one side of the Moon visible from Earth?,Why do we only ever see the same side of the moon?  If this is to do with gravity are there any variables which mean we might one day see more than we have before? 
6,How do star densities work?,"If we take a look at stars more massive than the Sun, their densities vary a lot. UY Scuti is an extremely low-density star that's only 8.5x more massive than the Sun, but is 1000-2000x its size. r136a1, on the other hand, is 256x more massive than the Sun, but is only 30x its size. Neither of them are main-sequence.   The Sun has a lower mass than both of them, yet it's also smaller than both of them.  It doesn't seem like mass makes a big difference. Both reach hydrostatic equilibrium at completely different sizes. r136a1 has a much stronger gravitational pull than UY Scuti, but it should also have much more radiation pressure, right?  So how can we determine the density of a star? Is there a formula? "
7,"Is it proper to refer to objects beyond Neptune as ""Kuiper Belt Objects?""","It seems to me that nowadays the more proper term is ""Trans-Neptunian Object"".  Is there any difference between Kuiper Belt Objects and Trans-Neptunian Objects?  If not, is one term preferred over the other? "
8,Precise declination of Moon,"The moon follows 5.14 deg inclined path. the ecliptic and the Moon's path coincide are called 'nodes', and they travel around the ecliptic in a period of 18.66 years.  Once every 18.66 years, the ascending node coincides with the vernal equinox, and the Moon will reach declinations of about +28° and -28° (much more than the Sun, which reaches ±23°); this is called a 'major lunar standstill'. 9.33 years later, the opposite is true, and the Moon will only reach ±18° during a 'minor lunar standstill'.  I read [website]The 0.88 deg, to time is 53 min, I think it seems to coincide with the fact the moon rises, 53 min sooner, over each day. Is this related to this? 13.2 deg * 4 min/deg = 53 min   The maximum inclination of the moon, for standstill, can it be specified by the eclipse point? On, august 21 2017, an eclipse occurs in 28.88 deg on latitude point. Is this angle the same as the inclination angle specified here: [website]I just want 28.88 deg = 28 deg 53' confirmed.  "
9,How do we know the current state of the universe by observing it from Earth?,"Since light travels at the constant speed and takes more than a billion years to travel from the distant parts of the Universe, how do we know the state of the distant regions? Do those still exist or not? Is our picture of the Universe outdated? "
10,What do gravitational waves allow us to understand?,"Before reading this question, you should read this paper.  From what I understood, we managed to detect gravitational waves for the first time.   Is this discovery going to help us understand something we haven't understood yet? Dark matter? Galaxy movements? FTL travel? Gravity manipulation, Interstellar style?   Though I understand the discovery, I'm a little confused about what it will actually improve for science.   So, what are the doors this discovery will open ?  "
11,Neutrino producton rate over time,Has the rate of neutrino production in the universe varied over time? Are there more or less being created now against the early days? 
12,"A non rotating asteroid of huge mass collides with earth. After the collision, does the length of the day on earth change?","A non rotating asteroid of huge mass collides with earth. After the collision, would the length of the day on earth increase or decrease? Why? "
13,What is the current accepted theory as to why Venus has a slow retrograde rotation?,"According to this NASA overview, the planet Venus is unique (amongst the major planets), Venus has a slow retrograde axial rotation, taking 243 Earth days to make one rotation (which is longer than its orbital revolution).   What is the current accepted theory as to why (and how) Venus developed this anomalous slow retrograde axial rotation? "
14,Can any information leave a black hole?,"Referring to this question, is there any information that can leave black holes? Are they causing a permanent information loss in our universe? "
15,"What is this thin, square-ish object on asteroid Bennu? How big is it?","What could this square thing be? Roughly how big is it? From BGR's Our first up-close look at the Bennu asteroid is a messy one:        rotated, 2x zoomed, and sharpened. unscientifically:   "
16,Can an astronaut ever reach a Black Hole theoretically?,"Ok, bear with me, while I try to explain the question I have.  I read that time slows as we approach a black hole.  So, suppose,theoretically, as astronaut is approaching a Black Hole. And he gets near enough now that time starts slowing down.  If you remember this equation: v=d/t  So, at the moment, t is going infinity, so it means  V is going zero. So the astronaut can never the reach the Black Hole because time is slowing down and its taking longer and longer for him to approach the Black Hole.  But then again, we know, a Black Hole sucks everything and that light cannot even escape it.  So, what's happening to the equation above then? [ this time it means v is going infinity and so, t is almost zero], so the astronaut will be sucked almost immediately.  Which one is the correct theoretical answer? "
17,Can a drastic change in a stars cycle cause harm or affect a nearby star system?,"If Alpha Centauri A our neighboring star happens to shift into a Red Giant or a Planetary Nebula, Will our star system be affected? And if so is there a ripple effect throughout the galaxy causing a disturbance or activating a nearby star to shift into a new cycle? "
18,Why is it said that the far side of the moon's crust is thicker?,"This video states that NASA has determined that the far side of the moon's crust is thicker than the near side's crust. How did they determine this?  Please note I'm not asking for theories or hypotheses on how this came to be, but rather if the difference in thickness indeed is measurable scientifically today.  [So off-topic: If it is in fact true, I favour the theory that the centrifugal force of the earth's gravity along with the fact that the far side is always pointing outwards, is responsible for this and not some other moon smashing into our moon etc. as is shown in that video.] "
19,What are the differences between a Black Hole and a Supermassive Black Hole,"From what I understand, the mass of a black hole should be nearly infinite, how much more massive can something get?    Is the name to be literally interpreted such that a Supermassive Black Hole just has more mass? Or rather, is a Supermassive Black Hole just a regular Black Hole with nearly infinite mass that is larger in diameter? If the difference is in fact a change in diameter, how are the changes in size with the retention of the immense mass reflected in the Supermassive Black Hole's gravitational field?  "
20,Navigation using moon phases,"How to navigate with possible maximal precision using moon phases?  The Moon is the brightest celestial body seen in the night sky, and it is possible to find even through moderate clouds. So it's a good natural object to use in navigation when a compass is not available.   A full Moon is quite an easy case - it's directly on the opposite site from the Sun. However, in the other phases, are there tables or mnemotechnical methods allowing to determine the north based on moon shape, assuming the time is known? Are they different depending on geographical height? Is it possible to estimate both north and the time of the night, when only the geographical height is known? "
21,highspeed black holes or neutron stars on (almost) head-on collision course and kinetic energy,"First: I don't think this is a duplicate question. There are related question on mergers of black holes that orbit around each other etc., so please read on.  I'm having a hard time picturing what might happen in the following scenario: Assume two black holes of the same size on an almost frontal collision course with a very high relative speed of x km/h (replace x with whatever would be necessary to enable the scenarios described below).  If their event horizons don't ""touch"" I'd assume their courses will change considerably but it would be a normal flyby - right ?  But what happens if their event horizons ""touch"", if their event horizons ""overlap"" just a few meters ?  On the one hand both objects have a massive kinetic energy with opposite directional vectors. And on the other hand nothing can escape below the gravitational radius.   Where does all the kinetic energy go ? Would the two black holes extremely deform, like creating a long string before they collapse into spherical form?  And what if in a similar scenario one of the two objects is a neutron star. Would the neutron star be ripped apart when it scrapes the black hole on high-speed flyby ? "
22,A question about using both the Simbad and the Gaia archive,"It seems a bunch of people, including myself, have got it into our heads to create a 3D visualisation of the stars around us - one where you get to fly around them rather than view them from the viewpoint of Earth.  This means, obviously, that I'm limited to stars that have parallax values, which in the case of the Gaia archive is about 2 million whereas in Simbad 100 000. The reason why I'd like to use both is that Simbad appears to have more useful information, including names and types of star. Also, amazingly, the highest parallax (in milliarcseconds) in gaia is in the 200s, which suggests that alpha centauri is not in the archive! My hunch is that Simbad is the place to go for nearby and named stars, whereas Gaia has higher numbers.  I imagine (perhaps incorrectly) that there is a way to identify a Simbad star on the Gaia database and vice versa. Gaia has a bunch of id values (solution_id, source_id, random_index) whereas on Simbad there's just the one (Identifier). I have the suspicion that Simbad may have more columns I'm not aware of.  In any case, my plan would be to query both archives, and weed out multiples based on an identifier of some sort. Maybe there's a third database that links the two? Maybe I'm missing something obvious? Perhaps there's the perfect page out there that tells me precisely how to do this which has eluded my googling.  Any help would be greatly appreciated. "
23,Why can we observe the Cosmic Microwave Background no matter the direction we look?,"I often read that the CMB was released from everywhere in the Universe, in every direction.   If that statement is true, can someone elaborate what ""everywhere in the universe, in every direction"" means ? If not, why can we observe it in every direction ? "
24,Is the colour of a wave from a far galaxy the same for us as for a galaxy which lies between?,"Because of the expansion of the universe, light from a far galaxy is redshifted. The expansion of the universe will make the wavelength of light longer. But is the colour of such light the same for us, as for an galaxy which is between us and the far galaxy.   I first thought that a further galaxy's speed was higher than ours, but I don't think that's right it is relative. But is the speed of the far galaxy from a view of the further galaxy higher than from our view? I don't think so because the universe is expanding faster the further you look. So for the further galaxy the speed of the far galaxy is less high than from our view because the far galaxy is further away from us.   So is the conclusion right that the colour of the same wave is more red for us on earth than from the further galaxy? "
25,What is the accepted theory as to why Uranus' axis is tilted so severely?,"The planet Uranus is another solar system anomaly, where according to the NASA profile has an axial tilt of 97.8 degrees, also considered to be retrograde.  This NASA summary ""Uranus"" suggests the current theory of a large planet-sized impact earlier in its history.  Does the planet-impact theory still hold true or have new accepted theories come to light?    Most of all, are there any results from any simulations available?  A note, this is posted as a separate question to my other question ""What is the current accepted theory as to why Venus has a slow retrograde rotation?"" as the axial tilt is significantly different. "
26,What is driving the expansion of the Universe?," Is it just the momentum from the Big Bang? If yes, how can it account for the acceleration of the expansion? Why isn't the collective gravitational force slowing it down? What part does dark energy play in the expansion?  "
27,"Determination of orbital elements for Trans-Neptunian Objects, how?","How are orbits calculated for Trans-Neptunian Objects?  I understand there are six standard parameters for defining an orbit (link) but I am not sure how telescope observations translate into these parameters.  Telescope observations tell us where the object is on the Celestial Sphere but can't even tell us (without a good spectroscopic line to do a redshift analysis with) how fast the object is moving towards or away from us.    Additionally, the motion of these objects on the sky is dominated by Earth's motion relative to the objects rather than the motion of the objects themselves.  This seems to me to offer additional complications.  My question is: how do 2-D observations get fit with a reasonable degree of accuracy to a 6-D parameter space with the additional complication of Earth's motion relative to the object?  Don't be afraid to be mathematical in your response. "
28,"What aliphatic compounds were found on Ceres, and how where they identified?","Los Angeles Times's article NASA's Dawn mission finds life's building blocks on dwarf planet Ceres says;     While the scientists aren’t sure exactly what the compounds are, the fingerprint is characteristic of material containing carbon-hydrogen bonds, and may include components like methyl and methylene.   I've located the mentioned Science article Localized aliphatic organic material on the surface of Ceres but it is paywalled.  What was found? Is it some spectroscopic feature? Aliphatic compounds are hydrocarbons that are not aromatic. Is there a spectral feature that says ""I am not aromatic"" specifically, or does this just mean that aromaticity was not detected? "
29,Relocation to Mars,One billion years into the future and the Sun has swollen in size and it is now not possible to live on Earth due to the heat. Mankind has relocated to Mars where the temperature is more favorable now than on Earth. My question is how much time has this gotten us before we can't live on Mars any longer because the Sun is dying ? The next step I guess will be to relocate to another Solar System ? 
30,What causes a star to become a pulsar?,"What processes does a star undergo to become a pulsar? Does it take a very specific star with a certain set of qualities such as ""Just the right mass, diameter, and composition,"" or is it a freak accident that certain stars live out their remaining life as a pulsar? "
31,L4&L5 positions?,"I know that, in L4&amp;L5, the distances to the two main bodies should be equal. Still, how can I calculate that distance with accuracy? How can I know that that distance is inside the equipotential surface? Let's take, as an example, the Sun-Earth system and the Earth-Moon system. Thank you in advance! "
32,How hot can a planet be?,"Given that some exoplanets, particular ""Hot Jupiters"", orbit very closely to their parent star, how hot can these planets become?  What is the hottest exoplanet discovered so far? "
33,How often do they move most/all of ALMA's dishes?,"The Phys.org article Unknown treasure trove of planets found hiding in dust reports on recently published radio measurements (~1.3mm) of planetary systems forming around stars in Taurus:     Scientists base this scenario of how our solar system came to be on observations of protoplanetary disks around other stars that are young enough to currently be in the process of birthing planets. Using the Atacama Large Millimeter Array, or ALMA, comprising 45 radio antennas in Chile's Atacama Desert, the team performed a survey of young stars in the Taurus star-forming region, a vast cloud of gas and dust located a modest 450 light-years from Earth. When the researchers imaged 32 stars surrounded by protoplanetary disks, they found that 12 of them—40 percent—have rings and gaps, structures that according to the team's measurements and calculations can be best explained by the presence of nascent planets.   The article ends by saying:     Going forward, the research group plans to move ALMA's antennas farther apart, which should increase the array's resolution to around five astronomical units (one AU equals the average distance between the Earth and the sun), and to make the antennas sensitive to other frequencies that are sensitive to other types of dust.      ""Our results are an exciting step in understanding this key phase of planet formation,"" Long said, ""and by making these adjustments, we are hoping to better understand the origins of the rings and gaps.""   Changing from 15AU to 5 AU suggests a roughly factor of 3 increase in the overall scale of the pattern of antennas. The linked paper in ApJ Feng Long et al. has a preprint in ArXiv as well, which says:     All observations were obtained from late August to early September 2017 using 45-47 12-m antennas on baselines of 21∼3697 m (15∼2780 kλ), with slight differences in each group (see Table 1).   Several years ago I remember reading about the design of ALMA and there are a lot more places to put dishes than there are dishes. I think there were five optimized configurations that all looked to have a similar spiral shape, but each one was maybe a factor of 2 or 3 larger than the previous.   Since the dishes take time to move and setup and calibrate, this probably doesn't happen that often.  Question: How often does it happen? How often do they move most of ALMA's dishes to change resolution?  If there's a site that shows how ALMA is set up now, and what the next setup will be and when, that would be great to know about as well.    above: ""Until recently, protoplanetary disks were believed to be smooth, like pancake-like objects. The results from this study show that some disks are more like doughnuts with holes, but even more often appear as a series of rings. The rings are likely carved by planets that are otherwise invisible to us."" Source Credit: Feng Long/ALMA "
34,Multiple aerobraking,"I moved this question to more related : Space exploration  I spent a lot hours with Kerbal Space Program recently and I am courious about one thing.  I got into orbit of moon and then I was able to get back to orbit of ""Kerbal"" (the home planet in this game, similar to Earth) and land succesfully.  I did not have much fuel left, therefore I wanted to save as much as possible for anything that can happen during landing. When I was at my Apoapsis (which was as far away as moon) from Kerbal I used fuel to get my periapsis to only 50km, while Apoapsis remained the same. The trajectory was very ""ellipse-like"".  What happend? When I was aerobraking at 50km with more than 3000m/s speed, the apoapsis decreasing, while periapses remains almost the same. Then I was catapulted ""back to the space"", but with shorter trajectory around kerbin.  I did this multiple times and after some time, my speed at periapsis decreased to 2400m/s and after that, the apoapsis got as low that I stayed in atmosphere and landed.  The point is - I did not have to use as much fuel to get low orbit, I slow down a lot with repeating ""slow a little with aerobreaking and then go again to space"".  I am curious - why this is not used in reality? At least I did not hear about it. I am thinking that probably real materials do not take lightly ""burn and freeze"" multiple times...? "
35,Circular orbits,"First of all, I'm studying orbits for a hobby: world building. Unfortunately, my mathematical abilities approach a ridiculous low threshold, which means I am stuck with reading the simplest explanations, which in turn leave me asking tons of fairly basic questions.  Allow me to start with a simple point. I know that Kepler's Laws state that planetary orbits must always be elliptical. I also know that Earth's orbit varies from more elliptical to less elliptical, and that its less elliptical stage is nearly circular.   So... what would happen if Earth did have a circular orbit? Why is it impossible for any planet (or moon, by the way) to orbit another body in a perfectly circular path? "
36,Bright lines in a continuum spectrum,"Dark lines in a continuum spectrum is common. But are there bright lines too?   By the stimulated emission process, the light can also be amplified, right?  In this case, we should get bright lines instead of dark lines. "
37,How many stars can stay close to each other without collapsing?,"Is it possible for two stars to exist close to each other?   ""Close"" is relative; let's assume that two stars are close to each other if they are at the center of the same solar system.   It's possible for this to happen with 3 stars. But what about more? How many stars can be the center of exactly one solar system without collapsing because of gravity? "
38,How does the Event Horizon Telescope implement the interferometry?,"The BBC article Event Horizon Telescope ready to image black hole describes the Event Horizon Telescope, a coordinated observing technique with several radio telescope arrays across the globe forming a synthetic aperture with an Earth-sized baseline.  [tex]  ...when plugging in 1 millimeter for [tex], and with [tex] and [tex] the radius of, and distance from Earth to Sagittarius A*, the black hole in the center of the Milky Way Galaxy of 20 million km and 26,000 light years, respectively. (values taken from the article).   The equation I've written shows that millimeter wavelength interferometry with an Earth-sized baseline has the possibility to resolve the existence of some structure with scale of the black hole's event horizon.   My question is How does the Event Horizon Telescope implement the interferometry? It would certainly be impossible to bring all signals together to a central site and perform the interference there in real time as down-converted analog signals, and quite difficult/expensive to do it with dedicated, synchronized digital optical fiber lines. Is the massive amounts of data sent as IP packets over the internet to a central correlator (numerical interferometer)?  The article mentions atomic clocks and lots of hard drives, and I have a hunch these have something to do with it.    above: ""The eventual EHT array will have 12 widely spaced participating radio facilities"". From BBC. "
39,Do all the objects in the universe exert force on all other objects?,"Do all the objects in the universe exert force on all other objects? Like a type of gravity; also, how much does it decrease as it gets farther away? "
40,Discovery of Near Earth Objects (NEO's),"Near Earth Objects (NEO's) have been mapped by NASA and JPL since 1990's. The graph below shows how many of these potential planet-killers have been found and classified over the years. I am curious as to why there have been so many more 140 meter to 1 km NEO's discovered, as opposed to NEO's with a diameter of 1 km or more. I think it is as simple as there are just more ""smaller"" objects left over from the formation of the solar system? Am I correct in saying this, or are there deeper astronomical processes at play here?   "
41,Do the orbits of planets change sometimes?,Do planets sometimes wobble and get off their paths? What if an asteroid were to hit it? 
42,What uncertainty does an error bar signify in astronomy?,"When an astronomer talks about her/his topic and shows an X/Y-plot with error bars. What should one assume that those error bars represent? 1 standard deviation? Or 2? Or some specific significance level like 95% or 99%? Is there a generally understood convention for this, or does it vary depending on topic? I've noticed that it is very rarely explicitly stated what the meaning is of the range which the error bars cover.  And how are the cases treated, where exact observations reveal a variation in the actual population? Not ""errors"", but natural true certain variation. Are there other bars to illustrate that range of true values, as opposed to the variation due to observational uncertainty? "
43,"If nothing travels at the speed of light, except light, how can a black hole also pull light into itself?",Is it because it has super massive gravity and energy? Or is it some sort of an anti-light component in it because it used to be a star? 
44,What are the Gamma rays and Cosmic rays effects on humans and equipments?,"First of all not to consider me a conspiracy theorist, but isn't landing on the moon a questionable issue? I am really not an expert in astronomy but let's assume that a moon landing has happened.  1- How would the Gamma rays and cosmic rays affect the equipments on the lunar surface and would these equipments function normally like on earth?  2-Could the enormous amounts of solar energy bursts be avoided somehow for protecting human flesh?  3-How is it possible for an FM or any kind of data transmission type be achieved in an environment that has nothing but an empty space? How would the electromagnetic waves travel and enter the earth's atmosphere to be captured by the receivers?  4-What is the bright lunar surface real temperature and is there a way to equip an astronaut to protect him from the over-heat?  Thanks for sharing any ideas that could explain these points not just for me, but for interested people who might view this question. "
45,The black hole binary that was detected by advanced LIGO - how do such hypergiant binaries form?,"With today's announcement of the historic detection of gravitational waves from the merger of 36 solar mass and 29 solar mass black holes 1.3 billion light years away, one can not help but wonder how such a black hole binary system was formed.  Has there ever been any observation of a hypergiant (class 0 or Ia star) binary system in the optical or other EM radiation? I would expect that these observations would be rare give the short lifespan of these stars.  If a black hole binary formed from a binary of population 3 stars with masses over 600 solar mass, how long would one expect that they would remain in orbit around one another before they merge? "
46,Will an observer falling into a black hole be able to witness any future events in the universe outside the black hole?,"I know someone or something sucked into a black hole could not survive, but is the bending of light so immense that an observer falling into a black hole will be able to witness any future events in the universe? That would definitely be cool :D I have a feeling this won't work though... so could you explain in detail why? Thanks. "
47,Explanation of the isochoric and isobaric instability conditions of interstellar medium gas clouds,"The question Why are there no ISM clouds with temperatures between 100 and 6,000K? has an accepted answer of the form:     Let [tex], [tex], and [tex] be the number density of hydrogen, the temperature of the gas, and [tex], where [tex] is the number density of the [tex]th component of the interstellar medium. We can then write the criteria for thermal equilibrium as   [tex]   where [tex] and [tex] and the heating and cooling functions, respectively, and [tex] is defined through those functions and [tex]. If the equilibrium is unstable,   [tex]   for entropy [tex].        This leads to different instability conditions, termed the isochoric and isobaric instabilities (Field (1965), [tex]). These can be determined from the temperature, pressure, and density of the gas (also assuming that the gas can be approximated as an ideal gas).   which is not helping me understand why there aren't any beyond saying simply ""because they are unstable.""  I think the key is to understand what the ""different instability conditions, termed the isochoric and isobaric instabilities"" refer to - what those terms mean.  Is it possible to provide an approximate explanation of these two instability conditions in words that would not presuppose the reader has substantial depth in statistical physics?     There may in fact be an explanation in this answer, but I need something unwound a bit further. Also possible help in the several answers to this question.  edit: I've looked at this and this as well, and I know there is a region when the line labeled ""heating rate"" has a negative slope, but I don't understand what this actually means. Is there something like a gravitational effect (triggered by density) or a phase change or chemical reaction that 'triggers' this instability?  "
48,What is Gravitational Lensing?,What is the effect known as gravitational lensing? How does it work? What objects would be able to cause this effect? 
49,How probably is it that galaxies will extinguish?,"In the nebulaes of galaxies are stars born, but the gasses and dust they are made of comes from exploded stars (fe supernovas). So it looks like these processes can go on continuesly. But is that really the case, or does according to entropy(?) galaxies extinguish because fe the galaxie went too big so gravity has no opportunity to form other stars any more. And before colliding with other galaxies it is passed away. So is there any sign that galaxies are getting smaller or less active? "
50,What would be the sizes of the bodies created from Jupiter's trojans?,"If all trojans from the Greek camp and all the trojans of the Trojan camp were combined into two bodies respectively, what sizes and masses these bodies would have? Would they qualify as dwarf planets? Would they be greater than Ceres? "
51,What is the upper and lower limit of temperatures found on stars?,What are the most extreme temperatures (both hot and cold) stars have been detected  at?  Is there an upper and lower limit for the detected temperature of stars? 
52,Is Planet Nine shepherding the Kuiper Belt?,"Is it possible Planet Nine is shepherding the Kuiper Belt similar to the way Jupiter shepherds the asteroid belt?   I understand that very little is actually known about Planet Nine at this point, but has it been postulated that it has control over the Kuiper Belt? I don't exactly intend to read any theoretical papers on the existence of Planet Nine because I am sure it will be way over my head, but I understand that it is from the position of several Trans-Neptunian objects that its existence has any merit at all.  So, I am wondering if part of that theory includes the Kuiper belt as a whole? "
53,"Why is the detection of gravitational waves such a ""Big"" deal?","I'm a non-scientist. Today's announcement of LIGO's detection of GW waves has been heralded as ""huge"" –on the same level as the Higgs Boson detection. I realize this is the last remaining part of Einstein's theory of general relativity to be directly observed. Is that why it's such a big deal? Does this mean the theory is now on pace to become the  law of general relativity?  Side note: I had the privilege to visit and take a general tour LIGO in WA in 2000 or so and found it quite fascinating from a layman's pov. I've been waiting for this day ever since.  "
54,How can maser emission be unpolarized?,"I was reading that:     However, unlike Galactic sources such as W3(OH), the emission is unpolarized and the 1667 MHz line is stronger than the 1665 MHz line.   but how is this possible? Does not the 1665 MHz line and 1667 MHz line correspond to a particular transition and dipole moment? Won't emitted photons naturally have a polarization?   Furthermore, they state:     The characteristics of the λ18 cm OH mega-maser emission differ from those of Galactic maser sources, such as the main line intensity ratio (T1667MHz/T1665 MHz > 1), large linewidth (>100 km s^−1), and unpolarized emission.   But why is unpolarized emission expected from extragalactic masers (arising near AGN) and not galactic ones (arising in circumstellar and interstellar environments)? "
55,what is gravitational force?,Gravitational force is particle or wave? I know that gravitation depend of the mass and the rotation speed but what is the transmission medium of this wave the same like transmission medium of the light ? 
56,What kinds of technologies are required to directly image exoplanets,"I have read that immensley powerful telescopes such as the European Extremley Large Telescope will be able to directly image the atmospheres of exoplanets, and even determine their rotation rates.   I am wondering, what are the obstacles that prevent current telescopes from achieving this; how will these obstacles be overcome exactly by the new telescopes such as the EELT; and tentativley when can we expect these kinds of telescopes to come online?  Also, is it theoretically possible to build a telescope (earth or space based) that can discern fine structures such as clouds, or surface features of exoplanets (or is this in fact the level of detail that will be achieved by telescopes such as the EELT)? "
57,What happened just before the Big bang?,Does the CMB contain any clues to what caused the Big Bang? Does a mathematical model theorize it?  
58,"How does ALMA produce stable, mutually coherent ~THz local oscillators for all of their dishes?","The ALMA (Atacama Large Millimetre/submillimetre Array) radio telescope's band-10 capabaility is now operational, per this answer. That's confirmed by NRAO's First Science with ALMA’s Highest-Frequency Capabilities.  According to this site ALMA's bands and frequencies are as follows:  band  wavelength   noise   frequency         (mm)        (K)      (GHz)  1    6.0 - 8.5     26     35 -  50  2    3.3 - 4.5     47     65 -  90  3    2.6 - 3.6     60     84 - 116  4    1.8 - 2.4     82    125 - 163  5    1.4 - 1.8    105    163 - 211  6    1.1 - 1.4    136    211 - 275  7    0.8 - 1.1    219    275 - 373  8    0.6 - 0.8    292    385 - 500  9    0.4 - 0.5    261    602 - 720 10    0.3 - 0.4    344    787 - 950   900 GHz (0.9 THz) is quite a high frequency for a radio receiver! Each ALMA dish down-converts received frequency to a baseband of a few GHz before they get digitized and sent to the correlator for digital interferometry, but you still need an ultra-stable local oscillator (LO) for downconversion, and all of the LO's of all of the dishes need to be mutually coherent. That's quite a feat considering they can be tens of kilometers apart!  Question: How does ALMA produce stable, mutually coherent ~THz local oscillators for all of their dishes?    As suggested in this partial answer to the question How does the Event Horizon Telescope implement the interferometry? hard drives collect digital data down-converted by local atomic clocks, probably using GPS as a secondary reference, then brought to a central location for post analysis.  I am guessing that they spend a significant amount of time trying to reconstruct coherence at the millimetre (picosecond) level, but that option is not available for ALMA as data is continuously recorded at some large fraction of 24/7, and the huge volume of data at a location where magnetic hard drives don't work is overwhelming. So they need to get it right the first time. "
59,"Since the Universe is expanding, is it accurate to say that a galaxy is 5 billion light years away?","Isn't it better to say that the light from the galaxy took 5 billion light years to reach us and it is a very old picture of it? However, if light travelled back to the galaxy at the constant speed and an observer was stationed to record it wouldn't it take longer to reach because of the expansion of the Universe?   Also if it still exists after 10 billion years or not we could not predict. So is the picture of the Universe more of a timeline of events rather than like a conventional map that shows distance between points.  How do current day theories tackle these issues? "
60,What astronomical observations would give conclusive proof of alien life?,"There are several ways we are coming closer to answering the question ""is there life elsewhere in the universe?"". One is by first understanding very well the origin life on our own planet. Another is by trying to look for radio signals from extraterrestrial civilizations. Another is to try to search for habitable exoplanets, and eventually examine the habitable ones in detail via direct imaging. Another is too look for evidence of life or life that existed in the past right in our own solar system (for exmaple on Mars, Titan, Europa, etc).   1) Have I missed any other astronomy-related approaches to answering this question?  2) Short of radio contact from an ET civilization, or a visit by aliens, or the discovery of life/past-life in our solar system, what would give conclusive evidence of alien life in the galaxy?   For example:  In 20 or so years when we develop the technology to directly image exoplanets, we will be able to determine their chemical composition and characterize their structure. If astronmers who study exoplanets found what they are looking for -evidence of oxygen and other biomarker gases - this might be highly suggestive of life, but not conclusive evidence. What kinds of observations of an exoplanets could enable us to say with ceartainty ""there is life on this planet""? Short of telescopic observations of truly unbelievable detail, I cannot think of a way that we can look at a planet and say ""yes there is life on it, or no there is not"" other than perhaps if seeing lights on the dark side of the planet.   Edit: Actually, I forgot the obvious scenario where there are trees/grass on the exoplanet.  But I don't think the plant life is required to be a different color from the rest of the terrain, and a planet with aliens does not have to have plant life. So we might not be able to detect life visually. "
61,Deep space radiation distribution,"What frequency distribution law applies to a random point in deep space that is assumed to be far away from any particular source of radiation.   Can it be expressed by some form of Plancks/Bose-Einsteins/Fermi-Diracs laws or a mix of all of them?   What would be the mean frequency/wawelength?  Would the mysterious ""dark energy"" be a major contributor to the distribution? "
62,How does an accreting black hole acquire magnetic fields?,"There is actually a similar question on this site: Can magnetism escape a black hole?, however the answers do not focus on accretion, which is my main concern, so I start a new one.  In Kip Thorne's book Black Holes and Time Warps: Einstein's Outrageous Legacy, there is a paragraph in Chapter 9, describing how the central black hole of a quasar (or radio galaxy) acquires a magnetic field through accretion:     Where do these magnetic field lines come from? From the disk itself.   All gas in the Universe is magnetized, at least a little bit, and the [accretion] disk's gas is no exception. As, bit by bit, the disk's gas accretes into the hole,   it carries its magnetic field lines with it. Upon nearing the hole, each   bit of gas slides down its magnetic field lines and through the horizon,   leaving the field lines behind, sticking out of the horizon and threading   it [...]. These threading field lines, firmly   confined by the surrounding disk, should then extract the hole's   rotational energy by the Blandford—Znajek process.   Unfortunately this description does not seem clear to me (although Thorne generally is excellent in explaining things throughout the book). To be specific, I cannot get a picture of the gas ""sliding down"" its magnetic field lines through the event horizon, while making the magnetic field ""stick out"" of the horizon at the same time. And here Thorne did not seem to point to any original research papers for further study.  So, my questions are:  (1) Do today's astronomers still believe that disk accretion is the main process by which supermassive black holes acquire a magnetic field?  (2) If the answer to (1) is ""yes"", then how can I build the picture (if there is such a picture) that Thorne is trying to convey in his paragraph?  (3) Is there any research paper that addresses this problem to some detail?  Any help is appreciated! "
63,Quantum Mechanics after the detection of Gravitational Waves,"Of course everyone knows by now of the detection of Gravitational waves  But, since General Relativity and Quantum Mechanics don't get along, can we say now that this detection proves that Quantum Mechanics doesn't actually apply and that General Relativity did prevail?  Another question: how can we identify the ripple's origin (let's say whether it's a result of the big bang or another big event)?  EDIT 16-2-2016  I was reading an article today and I thought I'd share it here; It's basically saying that without a third detector we can't triangulate the signal.  Some scientists tried ways to observe the light of the event directly after the observations of the wave but they couldn't detect the merger simply because it's too far away or too faint to be observed with our current technology. "
64,"How are exoplanets with 10,000 day periods discovered with the radial velocity method?","The radial velocity technique has apparently been used to discover exoplanets with extremely long orbital periods of ~10,000 days. For example, see this link:  [website]If the period of a planet is ~10,000 days, then the period of the star must be the same. However, this would mean that observations would need to be made over ~30 years to get a complete picture of the radial velocity variation of the star, a time which is far too long. How then are radial velocity measurements used to discover such planets? "
65,Is their any clue where gravitons come from?,"Everything which has mass has gravity. Some theories hypothesis that gravitons are responsible for that, but do they have any clue where they come from? Like gluons are interacting between quarks and photons between eg electrons. But does gravitons have, according to those theories, also have a kind of particle on their own with whom they are interacting with. Or is it possible that fe gravitons are also coming from quarks? "
66,"Travelling, flashing Star?","I have recently gotten into observing the night skies and learning about the stars/ star systems that are visible to me using an app on my phone. For the last month or so Venus and Mars appear in the early evening followed by some of the regular constellations (Orion, the two Canis'....) and later in the night skies Jupiter followed closely by the moon with Saturn peering out before daybreak. Yesterday night at around 20:15hrs I was looking up at the clear skies as I happened to be outside. I took a peek at the bright stars Sirius, Canopus and Rigel before concentrating on the Pleiades. As I was looking at that, one of the stars seemed to disappear in front my eyes. I thought it an illusion and carried on looking and about 6-7secs later a star appeared to the right of where I thought I saw one disappear initially. The light stayed for about 2secs and off it went again. I felt like someone was flashing a torch or even space station personnel having a call and response (baffled). One thing I was sure of was that it wasn't a plane as I am an Aeronautics man by profession and am familiar with all aircraft strobes. Another 6-7secs later it reappeared even further to the right than the second time round. For the next 11mins or so it came on and off at those regular intervals and yet still traveling to the right until it was out of my sight. tried to record a video of it with my phone but it wouldn't pick it up nor could it the other brighter stars. I was almost convinced by the end that it was some celestial matter but for the flashing light at exact intervals. Is it one of satellites in orbit? If so, is it normal for it to be equipped with flashing light/ strobe? "
67,How can we learn the inclination of the orbiting plane of the exoplanets using radial speed method?,"I heard about the radial speed method to discover exoplanets a few years ago, however, these questions kept confusing me. If we know a planet star of mess [tex] is orbiting a star by interpreting the  radial speed of the central mass, how can we tell wether this is a even more massive object whose orbiting plane has a larger inclination? Further more, even if we know the angle of our sight and the axis of orbit, can we determine the direction of orbit?  Thanks in advance. "
68,Heat from other Stars,Does the Earth receive any heat at all from the millions of other Stars in our Galaxy ? Is it light that is bringing the heat and perhaps it cools down on the long journey in Space getting to the Earth and that's why no significant amount of heat is getting here ? 
69,Can black holes collide with the Sun? In that case what will happen?,Can a black hole collide with the Sun?   What will happen in that case? Will the Sun survive? 
70,On what scale does the universe expand?,"According to the theory (or my understanding of it), the universe is not only expanding, but speeding up.  If the galaxies are moving apart, are the solar systems within them also moving apart from one another (&amp; the planets within them), if they are, won't the Sun be moving away from the Earth?  Does the expansion of the universe occur at all scales or just large (inter-galactic) scales? "
71,What is length of the universe on lights perspective,"According to Einsteins theory of special relativity, when something is travelling close to light speed, travel path is contracted. When the traveller is light itself, does it see the travel path contracted to zero? In another word, does light see length of the whole universe is zero? How? "
72,What would the night sky look like if Earth orbited an intergalactic star?,If the Earth and its host star were located exactly in-between the Milky Way and Andromeda would the night sky be completely void of light?   Would stars be visible to the unaided eye?  So there could be a civilization that exists in which the night is completely void of light? …that would suck  
73,Why is it strange that outer stars in a galaxy are travelling with the same speed as inner while the total mass is also increasing?,"Astronomers say that it's strange that the outer stars of a galaxy are travelling with the same speed as the inner stars. Therefore they introduced dark matter to solve this strangeness. The theory that the inner stars 'have to' go faster is that because they are closer to the center so the gravity is more, like the earth is closer to the sun and faster than Neptune.   But what I wonder is, whether the fact that just the outer stars are attracted to more mass, because there is more mass of stars that are within the orbits of the outer stars, explains the equality? So in this view it is not so strange that they have the same speed because they are influenced by more gravity. Or is it that this extra influence is considered to be too little to explain the equality?  "
74,"If space was n>3 dimensional, would clouds of particles still turn into 2D disks due to gravity?","I don't fully understand why clouds of particles which turn into galaxies and solar systems usually result in an (approximately) 2D shape, but whatever. Would they still result in an almost 2D shape if our space was n dimensional with [tex] and the laws of physics were the same (adapted for that [tex])? Or would it be an (approximately) [tex] dimensional shape?  It would be of interest to have an answer to this question under the assumption that the attractive force was still proportional to [tex] even when the dimensionality is greater than 3.  "
75,What is the unit used for star brightness due to skyglow?,What is the name and unit of the quantity in which star brightness due to skyglow is measured? How can it be measured from RAW image files of stars? 
76,What proportion of planetary systems have been found with 'Hot Jupiters',"According to the NASA website ""The strange attraction of Hot Jupiters"", one of the main types of exoplanets that have been detected are Hot Jupiters, which are      These are behemoth worlds that orbit close to their parent stars, blocking a fraction of the star’s light when it transits in front.   Planets that are from as large as Saturn through to far larger than Jupiter, orbiting in a matter of days very close to their parent star.  Something our solar system does not have.  What proportion of star systems have Hot Jupiters within their systems?  Is it a case that Hot-Jupiter-less systems such as our own are unusual? "
77,Distance of a planet to the star?,"QUESTION:  Suppose we discover a planet orbiting a nearby star.  The distance to the star is 3 pc.  We observe the angular radius of the planet’s orbit to be 0.1 arc sec.  How many AU from the star is the planet?   **CONCERN: I am not sure what ""The distance to the star is 3 pc"" means. The earth's distance to the star? or the sun's distance to the star? or even better, the planet's distance to the star??!!  Any explanation of the question would be greatly appreciated!  My initial approach was some fixed position (say sun/earth's distance) to the star is 3pc,  so I will have    0.1 arc sec = 3pc/distance, and solve for distance as the answer. (I reckon this is a very simple question for astrophysics, but I need to get basics right) "
78,Gravitational wave detection time difference between LIGO Livingston and LIGO Hanford,"Quote from LIGO's news release:     By looking at the time of arrival of the signals—the detector in   Livingston recorded the event 7 milliseconds before the detector in   Hanford—scientists can say that the source was located in the Southern   Hemisphere.   GPS coordinates of LIGO Livingston: 30.5630018,-90.7763949 GPS coordinates of LIGO Hanford: 46.4554032,-119.4092701  Distance: 3030.13 km  Now if the gravitational waves propagate outwards at the speed of light a difference of 7ms implies the following maximum possible detector distance:  299792458 * 0.007 / 1000 = 2099 km   Where am I wrong ?  Update:  As pointed out by james-kilfiger in the comments below, the calculated 2099 km is the minimum distance and not the maximum ... these waves seem to have caused some mental derangement ;) "
79,Estimating the angle covered by the star trails and deducing how long the exposure lasted,"How would you estimate the angle covered by the star trails and deduce how long the exposure lasted in the following image?    Here is the photo's caption:     Star trails beyond the Gemini Observatory on Mauna Kea, from which a laser beam forms a guide star on the Earth's ionosphere that enables the use of adaptive optics. In this long exposure, the laser beam tracks across the sky, making the visible arc. (The object in the sky at which the laser was pointed changed several times during the night.) Note that stars rise and set at an angle (not perpendicular) relative to the horizon, because Hawaii is about 20 degrees north of Earth's equator. Also, the farther a star is from the pole, the more its path looks straight, over a short distance.   I read the answer to this question about how to measure star trail angles     The only star trail angles I'm familiar with deal with astrophotography.   You set up a camera, put the film in, open the shutter for a time exposure of the stars. As the stars appear to revolve around the earth, they make ""arcs"" on the film.      To calculate the angle of the arc, use the formula: 1 minute of time = 15 minutes of arc. If the answer is over 60, divide by 60 to get degrees of arc. So: 12 minute exposure = 180 minutes of arc or 3˚ of arc length for your star trail.    I'm not sure how to approach this problem since the answer uses time to calculate the angle of the arc, but no time is given here. "
80,"What qualifies as a good place for stargazing, i.e. with least light pollution?","I know that minimal light pollution is a must for stargazing, and a place which is away from civilization is better.

84,Why is Neptune true anomaly decreasing?,"So I've been having fun with trying to determine where the perihelia of different planets are (using JPL Horizons).  And by the time I got to Saturn, something weird started happening. I've noticed that at some moments true anomaly (that I've used to track perihelion time) started falling rather than rising. I've also noticed that it seems to be only a slight effect, which also demonstrated ~ 17 days period. So I though: perhaps that's the effect of Titan, right? Problem solved.  Yet now I look at Neptune's true anomaly (see the last column on the picture) and have absolutely no idea what's going on. Can somebody explain, please? How is something like that even possible? It's like the planet decided to go backwards for a change.  My settings are:  Ephemeris Type [change] :   OBSERVER  Target Body [change] :  Neptune [899]  Observer Location [change] :    Sun (body center) [500@10]  Time Span [change] :    Start=1900-01-01, Stop=2100-12-01, Step=1 Y  Table Settings [change] :   QUANTITIES=18,41  Display/Output [change] :   default (formatted HTML)   "

86,Solar Eclipses for dummies: Step 1 - moon equatorial orbit around a planet without axial tilt,"Note 1: I've studied downvoted questions and decided that I either asked too many questions or I sound like I'm setting a fantasy world. So I'm editing my question accordingly.   Note 2: I'm a language teacher. I learnt equations with variables but that was over 20 years ago and I remember little of it; I never learnt trigonometry and other more advanced maths, that's a fact, but if there's no way around it I'll do my best to tackle it.  Note 3: My approach to understanding eclipses, due to the above stated handicap, is removing all the complicating factors (namely, the axial tilt and the moon's 'ondulating' orbit). I assume that, if I can fully understand such a simplistic scenario, I can then follow the mechanics of the real Earth scenario.  Therefore, I have written below the points I am confident are true. The ones I don't know are asked as questions (Q) and formatted in bold.    Every new moon would be a total solar eclipse. The path of totality would always cover the same area: a 250km  wide corridor with its centre at the equator (so 125km over the northern hemisphere and 125km over the southern hemisphere).  I think the path of totality wouldn't always cover the same area, e.g. always over Africa, so Q1: Is there a simple formula to predict which areas would be in the path of totality? In real life, the moment of totality can vary from seconds to seven minutes. But in my study example, Q2: the period of totality should always be the same, right? Because the crossing path of moon and sun is always the same (while in real life the Moon can overlap the Sun at different angles and going in different directions) Q3: How can I calculate this period of time? What about the latitudes for whom the solar eclipse would only be seen as partial? I understand that the nearest to the path of totality, the more covered the sun will be, and vice-versa. Q4: Is there a set value that says e.g. for each km, another degree is visible?   If this question is still not ideally adjusted, please leave a comment so I can further improve it. "
87,Transit Depth Color Versus Transmission Spectroscopy,"One of the tools being developed for the study of exoplanets is called transmission spectroscopy - basically looking at how passing through the exoplanet's atmosphere changes the spectrum of the star. The problem, though, is that spectroscopy is hard, and requires a big telescope, probably space-based. This makes the process slow. It seems that it would be very useful if we would triage the data using broad-band photometry to more quickly limit the presence of compounds like water, [tex], and [tex]. Looking at a plot of Earth's atmospheric transmission, with a breakdown by chemical compound, it seems like looking at the color of the transit depths in and between the windows in the wavelength range from 1 to 20 microns, might provide a plausible alternative to quickly get information on the atmospheres of planets and brown dwarf stars.  For the exoplanets, specifically, the wavelengths blocked by an atmosphere make the planet, effectively, bigger at some wavelengths than at others, depending on the opacity at that wavelength, the thickness (density) of the atmosphere, and vertical extent of it.  The question is: is this practical? Specifically, with a 1 to 2 meter class space telescope that simultaneously images in 2 to 8 filters? "
88,Does earth's Umbra reach Sun-Earth L2?,"Moon can be fully eclipsed by the virtue of being fairly close to Earth. Any body distant enough will not be eclipsed fully, Earth's disc not fully covering Sun's disc. How's that for anything at the L2 point?

89,Is there a name for this type of orbit of a natural satellite?,"Is there a name for the orbit of a natural satellite of a planet who's period is the same as the rotational period of the planet, but the orbital motion has the opposite sense than the planet's rotation?  If there isn't an existing term or name, how would it at least be described, technically?  How much does the tidal effect affect satellites in a retrograde orbit? "
90,How would Jupiter's brightness relative to our sun seem to a remote observer (observing from a remote star),Given that Jupiter is 5 AU from our sun and a remote observer viewing our solar system from some other part of our galaxy looks at it.

91,Can a moon have a moon?,Is it possible for a natural moon to have a natural moon? What is the limit to when satellites on satellites becomes to unnatural for it to be possible? 
92,Is the Earth Really Spinning? (honest question),"Most people consider it common knowledge that the Sun's ""movement"" in the sky is only perceived due to the Earth's ""spin and movement"".  Based on this, you'd think that the stars in the night sky (when viewed with time lapse photography) would take a path in the sky similar to the sun. After all, both the sun and stars are practically stationary over the course of one day, given their accepted distances from the earth.  Yet, time lapse photography shows this is not the case.  Compare these photos:  1) Time Lapse of Sun  2) Time Lapse of Stars  3) Time Lapse of Moon  If the Earth's spin is the primary reason for ""movement"" of things (farther than clouds in the sky), then why do the sun and moon move through the sky in a similar fashion that is totally different from the sky-path of the stars? The Earth is said to spin around 360 degrees every 24 hours. It seems to me that everything in the sky should move in one direction where I live (Texas).  To me (in Texas), it seems the stars should sweep from horizon to horizon over the course of the Earth's night-spin (like the sun and moon do). Yet, the time lapse photos show circular paths in the sky for the stars. That would make sense at the poles, but not in Texas!?  -Lonnie Lee Best "
93,Difficulties in finding Jupiter,"I am new to astronomy. Jupiter is now visible to the naked eye but I have difficulties in locating it with my (new Newtonian reflector) telescope. The lowest magnification I have is 36X, which I guess is part of the problem(?). Any tips for the beginner..? I feel that if I knew any star constellations, it would help in locating objects. "
94,Adiabatic versus convection,I am reading about the interior temperature structure of Jupiter. It says in various texts that there are regions in Jupiter's atmosphere which are well-approximated by a dry adiabatic lapse rate.   Does this mean that in these regions there is convection happening? Is adiabatic just a general synonym for convection? 
95,Precessing of the Earth,"It's been known that the Earth's axial tilt varies from 22.5 to 24.5. Does this result in a wobbling while the value of the tilt varies about these two limits? If so, how does it affect the mechanics of the Earth's movement (its rotation and revolution about the Sun)? "

99,Why do Earth and moon move apart but binary black holes move closer?,"According to the accepted answer on Is the moon moving further away from Earth and closer to the Sun? Why?, the moon is receding from Earth because tidal forces and friction cause energy to be lost.  However, according to LIGO's website,     As the two masses rotate around each other, their orbital distances   decrease   as they lose energy radiating inspiral gravitational waves.  Why do the bodies move apart in the Earth-moon case but closer together in the black hole case?  If both opposing phenomena are present but a different one is stronger in the two cases, what determines the fate of a system? "
100,Total number density of galaxies and problematic expression in practise,"This post comes from physics exchange forum, I have transfered it here, maybe I will be luckier since I have not received answers on the other forum.  Here is the issue :  I am asked to give the formal expression of the total number density of galaxies and explain why is this expression problematic in practice.  From what I saw from my research and into my lectures, I have found the follwing relation which gives the number of galaxies [tex] with magnitude [tex] (number counts) :  [tex]  [tex]  I don't know what the teacher wants to highlight, i.e by saying that the formal expression of the total number density of galaxies is problematic in practice, given that I even haven't the kind of expression or equation which gives the estimation of galaxy density.  1) Concerning this distribution to use, do you advise me to use a distribution as a function of magnitude, mass or a distribution as function of luminosity (like Schechter) ?  2) I have seen on web the HMF (Halo Mass function) but it seems to be about the dark matter halos : can we count one dark matter halo per galaxy ?  3) But the problem is here is that a dark matter halo is more massive than the galaxy hosted in this halo : how can we deal with this ?   If someone could help me, this would be kind.  PS: I have also to explain why the estimation of galaxies density is difficult and problematic.  4) What are the issues when we want to estimate density of galaxies ?  Concerning the distribution as a function of luminosity, I have found the Schechter luminosity function :  [tex]  UPDATE 1: my apologies, [tex] and [tex] represent apparent magnitude and not masses.   But the questions remain about the counting of galaxies and the computation of total density at large scale.  In practise, what are the major problems when we want to estimate this density ?  UPDATE 2: people here not really motivated by this bounty ... feel free to ask for precisions about this post .  For the moment, I am faced to know at which scale I can compute a mean density : have I got to take into account this scale since it seems to have a dependance between density and volume considered, doesn't it ?  Is there a general formula to express this dependance ?  Regards "
101,How long does it typically take to make a telescope yourself for the first time?,How difficult is it to make a telescope oneself? How much time would it take for a first-timer? What are the typical pitfalls? 
102,Constructing a periscope/telescope - trouble with lenses,"Not sure if this is the best place for this, maybe physics would be a better fit, but I'm trying to build a periscope and am running into an issue.   Traditional mirror periscopes work well, but when I look into the one end of the periscope, I see the reflected image at the end of a long tube. I figure that using some combination of lenses, you should be able to make it look as if the position of your eye/head was actually at the top of the tube looking out at the world rather than looking through a tube.   My thinking here is that when you look through binoculars or a telescope, you don't see the inside of the tube, just the enlarged image. So shouldn't you be able to do the same thing but without the magnification?  I purchased some lenses from Amazon with focal lengths of 200mm and -100mm and based on some optics simulators assumed(incorrectly apparently) that I could arrange them 10cm apart and then another set reversed on the other side like so:  `````()````````````````)(```````````)(``````````````() 200mm````````-100mm``-100mm```````200mm  () = convex lens )( = concave lens  The thinking here was that one set would condense the image down so that the walls of the tube were no longer visible within that viewing angle, and then the other reversed set would reverse that and the image would be back at normal size to my eye, it would just look as though my eye were actually at the opposite end of the tube.   This didn't work. The image is close to life size, but the tube looks even longer: a foot long tube has turned into a 3 foot long tube, and the circle I can see the world through is very small.  Is this a pipe dream? I feel like it must be possible if they used periscope in military applications for years before electronics and fiber-optic cables were invented.   Where did I go wrong? Any guidance would be hugely appreciated.  Edit: some follow up questions  Am I stuck having a small field of view out of the end? Or would using a lower focal point(wide angle) lens allow me to see a wider angle?  Also, is there any way to have a variable length tube? For instance if I'm looking around a wall, is there a way to install the lenses so that the tube could be ""telescoped"" out to look around a thicker wall? "
103,Is it ever possible that the graviation from the mass of kinetic rotational energy will overcome centrifugal force?,"This is, I think, somewhat intuitively obvious, but this comment got me thinking about this:  what is gravitational force?  ""Rotation speed can create centrifugal force opposing gravity and making things lighter,"" Rotation also stores energy, and energy is mass, per [tex]. A body spinning sufficiently fast will exert higher gravity, e.g. a slowly-spinning neutron star will have a weaker gravitational pull than equivalent neutron star that spins very fast.""  Intuitively, my answer is ""no way"", added mass by rotational velocity I would think, could never be extensive enough to counteract the ""flicking off"" or centrifugal force of very fast rotation.  Even with a Neutron Star I would think it's impossible, but I'm not 100% sure, so I thought I'd ask.  If we ignore relativity from motion but not [tex], as that's the crux of the question  Centrifugal force = [tex]  Kinetic energy of rotation = [tex]  Mass equivalent of kinetic energy = [tex]  gravitational force [tex]  so if we apply the gravitational force of kinetic energy  [tex], or, simplified, [tex]  and we compare the two equations  Centrifugal  [tex] additional gravitational   [tex]  we can remove [tex] from both on the top and 1 [tex] from the bottom  additional gravitation ratio to centrifugal force = [tex]  [tex] and [tex] are numerical.    [tex] is very small, [tex] is very big and the ratio grows smaller as the radius grows larger.  gravitational constant:   $6.67408 × 10^{-11} m^3 kg^{-1} s^{-2} c = 2.998 x 10^8 m s-2  the ratio, unless my math is broken, centrifugal force to additional gravity from added mass by kinetic energy of motion = [tex], so you'd need a hugely small r, almost a plank length or a singularity where the added gravity from kinetic energy of rotation would overcome the ""flicking off the surface"" or centrifugal force.    When I work out the units, I get meters per kilogram, which I don't think is right.   The units should cancel out with a ratio of two forces in opposite directions, so I think I made an error, but I don't see where I made it.  My question is two fold.    1) is my math broken? and if so, where?   and 2) is the added mass from kinetic rotational energy ever relevant, say in a very rapidly rotating Neutron star?   Could it ever assist the Neutron star in collapse or add gravity?, I can see how it could add to flattening, as rotation flattens objects naturally and perhaps, add a speck of gravity on the polls where centrifugal force is zero, but logically, I think, rotational energy would end up spinning any non black hole object apart, long before the added energy of rotation had enough mass to make a measurable difference on gravity.    Is my sense right or is there a situation where added mass from energy of rotation could overcome the centrifugal force? "
104,Is the moon moving further away from Earth and closer to the Sun? Why?,According to The NASA Moon Facts page:     The moon is actually moving away from earth at a rate of 1.5 inches per year.   Why is the moon moving further away from the Earth? Is this a result of the moons formation that set it in motion to spiral away from us? Or is this a resultant force of the gravity from the Sun and other large bodies? 
105,Which rotational frame does the universe prefer?,Which rotational frame does the universe prefer? We say that the earth rotates once per 24 hours. But is this the master frame? What is the solution to Newtons Bucket Problem?  I would like if the answer is a detailed explanation. I know about high school math and science and participated in a astronomy olympiad. 
106,number density of Dark Matter Halos Versus number density of Galaxies,"Can we count only one dark matter halo for each Galaxy ?  Indeed, I am trying to estimate the total density of galaxies in given volume and I have often seen on physics exchange and other forums the estimation of dark matter halos distribution (as a function of the mass of halo or as a function of Luminosity).  If I could count one galaxy per halo, this would make the things simplier but I think that things are more complicated, especially since a halo and the galaxy associated to this halo have not the same mass, so distribution mass is different (mass of halo is not linear towards the mass of galaxy, isn't it ?).  If someone could help me on this issue, regards "
107,Will we see gravitational waves from the big bang?,"This is almost identical to an unanswered question already asked, but I want to put it a different way. The announced LIGO event was from a localized source. I assume that gravitational waves from the Big Bang would come from ""everywhere"" like the CMB, so I don't see how LIGO or the next generation observatory (ie. eLISA) would detect this.  One thing else I would like to know, if anyone is aware: I watched an hour long webcast on You Tube and the question I had during the whole time was asked just as the webcast went ""off the air"". My question is that, since this announcement is about five months after the detection and since it happened ""right away"", has anything else been detected over the last five months? (Has LIGO been continuously observing? I know that the upgrade is still in progress and sensitivity should get about three times better.) "

109,Why search for water?,"Most of the news about extraterrestrial search focuses on possibility for existence of water and temperatures like earth. Why do scientists feel this would lead them to extraterrestrial life?     After all, we are searching for something that doesn't exist on earth. Why do we assume it would have behavior like us? Maybe the matrix inside their cells is of acetone or something else. Water may not play the role in their lives as it does for us. Maybe they can sustain high temperatures, maybe they can live in extreme cold. Why should we look for earth-like planets, isn't there a baseless (of course it's not baseless, there must be some logic which I want to know) assumption that the aliens are human-like (or any species on earth)? "
110,Why does radio astronomy offer higher resolution images than optical?,"According to this lecture,""Radio astronomy has several advantages over optical astronomy...We can make the highest resolution images, and see things happening on the smallest scales.""  Why is this? If resolving power, [tex] then shouldn't shorter wavelength light result in smaller angular resolution i.e. better resolution? "
111,Orbital eccentricity variation of the other planets?,"On Earth, it's fairly well published, mostly in climate change related articles, that the Earth's orbital eccentricity operates on a 413,000 year cycle with roughly 90,000–125,000 year variation within that cycle.  Source  The cause of this variation is primarily the other planets, with Jupiter and Saturn usually mentioned as the primary causes (same link).  Question is two fold.   How stable is the Earth's orbital eccentricity cycle?  413,000 years sounds enormously precise, but logically, I would think small changes in planetary orbits would create some variability.   Is the 413,000 years well established and repeating or is it more uncertain?  And, do we have a good estimate of other planets orbital eccentricity variation?  I looked, but couldn't anything at all on other planets eccentricity cycles.   The closest I came was this gravity simulation chart below.    90,000 year eccentricity chart of the 4 inner planets here, and method used.  Source. "
112,How would humans with appropriate equipment navigate the surface of Saturn's moon Titan on foot?,"Taking into account the physical characteristics of Titan (e.g. surface gravity, atmospheric pressure), what would be the most efficient method of motion for an astronaut to navigate the surface of Titan on foot?  Would it be a leaping or hopping motion? Or would it make more sense to walk somehow? I'm unsure how the friction of the ground would accommodate for that.  For the purpose of this thought experiment, lets assume that humanity has the necessary equipment to put an astronaut on Titan and to have protective clothing to enable reasonable safety from environmental hazards on the surface.  Thanks in advance! "
113,Does the Sun rotate?,"The planets rotate as an after effect of their creation, the dust clouds that compressed span as they did so and the inertia has kept it rotating ever since.   It's fairly easy to prove that planetary bodies are rotating just by watching their features move across their respective horizons.   This seems less easy to discern for amateur astronomers  in the case of the sun though.   Does the Sun also rotate as a by-product of it's creation? What evidence is there to support this? Does the sun have any discerning features that make it evident it is rotating? "
114,Why can we detect gravitational waves?,"Now that LIGO has finally measured gravitational waves using a huge laser interferometer, to me, the question remains, why was it possible? As it is explained in many news articles, gravitational waves are similar to water waves or electromagnetic waves, they just do not exist in a medium like water or space, but space-time itself is the transport medium. If space-time itself gets contracted and expanded by the gravitational waves, so does any means of measurement. The ruler you use for measurement (the laser beam) gets deformed while the wave travels through the measuring device. Otherwise the ""ruler"" had to live outside of space-time, but there is no outside. If space-time was a cup filled with pudding, on which we had painted a straight line with 10 marks, pushing into the pudding slightly with our thumb does bend the line, but for us, there remain 10 marks on the line, because to measure the extension, we had to use a ruler, outside of our space-time (pudding) to measure, let's say, 11 marks. But, well, there is no outside. I assume the same happens not only to the 3 spacial dimensions but also to the time dimension. Because they ""did it"", what am I missing? "
115,Exo Planets and Planets difference?,"After hearing that it has been confirmed that we found seven similar exoplanets like earth. I thought exoplanets were dead stars. After doing a little bit of research I found out that exoplanets are planets that are orbiting a star, NOT the sun. But isn't a star like the Sun? Can someone please explain this to me? "
116,Simple rule to find some of the zodiac constellations after sunset?,"How do I find some of the constellations of the zodiac without remembering their locations on the sky?  I think it should be quite simple if you are located in the northern hemisphere and you know  1) which astrological sign it is right now (this month) 2) where the sun set 3) the number of hours left until sunrise 4) the order of the constellations in the circle of the zodiac: Aries, Taurus, Gemini, Cancer, Leo, Virgo, Libra, Scorpio, Sagittarius, Capricorn, Aquarius and Pisces.  Straight forward logic says that it is enough to make calculations in order to understand where they should be, but I can't find any such rule on the internet. Maybe it is not so simple. Have you seen such a rule? "
117,Radio Astronomy and Imaging,"So, I've been starting to investigate radio astronomy, and am wondering about if certain things are possible from an amateur standpoint. I was looking at this powerpoint(that discusses building a tiny radio telescope), [website]On Slides 11, 12, and 13, it shows various radio emissions overlayed on the orion constellation. As well as Slide 17 and 18.  I'm wondering, is the data acquired in these images, doable from an amateur standpoint? From previous research I think I can build some detection devices for the Hydrogen Line emission(1420Mhz/21cm line), and that could lead to data(per my initial/basic understanding)  that's shown in image 1. Am I right in that assumption, and are the other emissions or data doable from an amateur standpoint? "

121,How to derive the redshift of GW150914?,"We all know LIGO has detected gravitational wave(GW) directly. prl   The LIGO team argue they detected the merger of two solar mass black holes([tex]) at z=0.09.   My questions are  It seems GW has Doppler shift too. There is a GW spectrum with emission or absorption lines like optical spectrum?    Figure.2 of the PRL paper seems to be very simple. Generally, people take their masses derived seriously? There may be other models which can give different masses. It is different from Taylor binary which was observed many years.   What does a 100HZ GW mean?  That is the frequency of the two arms shrink and extend?  What does the frequency stand for in the binary system?  The discovery can not be confirmed. DO you think the team win a Nobel prize only after other facilities like LISA find GW again? "
122,Are there collected data about the direction of rotation of black holes and the direction of the magnetic field?,"Is there a relation between the direction of rotation of black holes or neutron stars and the magnetic dipole moment of BH or neutron stars? BTW, are there different directions of this two parameters for suns?  Edit  I want to be sure there are or there are not the direction of rotation (which one can expressed by an arrow on the rotation axis) and the direction of the magnetic field (expressed by an arrow from the south to the north pole (both arrows are simple conventions)) parallel only. I'm not sure that the direction of the magnetic field is observable at all. And the comment from Zibadawa Timmy about pulsars perhaps a good extension to my question about BH, neutron stars and Suns.

123,What would happen if those gravitational waves were much stronger?,"What if those gravitational waves detected would be actually so strong that the distance of those mirrors moved would be larger? Not 1/1000th of proton but rather one millimeter, or one meter or even more? What would happen to us? How big would these black holes had to be and how much energy would be released in such a process? "
124,Are the Trappist-1 planets in stable orbits?,"The Trappist-1 planets all orbit very close to each other.  During NASA's press release, they mentioned that these planets are close enough to disturb each others orbits.  Is this system stable over a long time scale?  Or could we perhaps just have imaged this system before one or more planets is ejected or destroyed?  Later into the press conference, one of the scientists says ""these planets should have formed further out and migrated inwards"".  Could they possibly still be moving inwards, or are their orbits now stable? "
125,"Do all objects get larger in an ""expanding universe""?","I'm envisioning an analogy of the universe as a plane with marbles in that plane to represent different planets.  Now, if this plane expands how does this work? I assume that it is not like 'nothing' becomes 'something' then but rather expanding/stretching the universe; but doesn't this imply that everything around us is actually stretching/becoming bigger (like every atom/quarks) becomes a little bit bigger? Or is it just the space between those subatomic particles and combinations of these become bigger?   An example could be the structure of carbon dioxide becoming larger, but only because there is more space between the carbon and the oxygen atoms. "
126,How long does it take to produce a star? Why does it take that long?,"I wonder, why stars take a really long time to become stars? Is it because it needs to gain mass? Or heat up? Something like that? And could it be sped up at all? "
127,Are the Trappist-1 planets close enough to be tidally heated?,"According to the NASA press release, the Trappist planets are close enough (only a few million kilometers) that ""the tidal forces between the planets are not negligible"".  The speaker says that this could cause ocean tides on the planets.  Are they close enough that the tidal forces could heat the interior of the planets? "
128,What effect does the Moon have on the near Earth asteroid population?,"Does the big (0.012 Earth masses) Moon of Earth clear away NEAs, Earth orbit crossing asteroids, in a significant way? Venus and Mars don't have large moons, do they therefore have larger or smaller population of near asteroids than Earth would have if it were in the same orbit?  The outer planets have large moons, but also lots of captured asteroids, trojans and centaurs. Does a large moon even help gathering such objects, rather than ejecting them? Moonless Mercury and Venus seem to be pretty clean. "

130,"Why when we look through a telescope in space, do the billions of stars not block our view from seeing further?","I know that we are able to ""see back into time"" by looking very far away through telescopes such as the Hubble telescope, but my question is, wouldn't you run into at least a couple of stars that were blocking your vision when you were trying to look even farther?   Imagine a big Boulder in front of another smaller Boulder  and if we are looking from the side of the larger Boulder, we wouldn't be able to see the smaller one because the bigger one was in the way. Hopefully that simplifies my question. If it is as simple as that, wouldn't we miss stars and not be able to view them? "
131,Why haven't more captured small moons been found?,"Shouldn't captured moons have the same size distribution as asteroids? And asteroids are more common the smaller size they are. Moons are likely captured if they are in highly inclined orbits, and those moons should've originated as asteroids or Kuiper Belt objects. But there are only two moons, out of 194 known, smaller than 500 meters in radius. Aegaeon and S/2009 S1 both of Saturn. Although it is expected to exist over a million asteroids smaller than that. And all of Pluto's moons were large enough to be found before New Horizons arrived (sorry Alan Stern, no moon for you!)   Is this purely an observational bias?  Is it expected that the planets are surrounded by a myriad of moons too small to have been detected yet, from hundreds of meters down to dust grains? Do they all somehow gather into planar rings below a certain size? (I think the main line is that a ring system forms as a result of a single collision or tidal crunching event). Or what mechanism makes them lack small to tiny moons and dust?     How would this asteroid size frequency plot compare to a moon size frequency plot? "
132,What would be the outcome for life in our galaxy if the merger of the Milky Way and Andromeda creates a Quasar?,"If predictions are correct, the Milky Way and Andromeda are set to collide in around 4 billion years. If, when this occurs, a Quasar is formed by matter being accreted to the common galactic center (perhaps with the two supermassive black holes forming a binary), what would be the outcome for life in the new galaxy?  It's known that galactic collisions were much more common in the early universe; most Quasars are observed at high redshifts. It isn't clear if there are other conditions necessary to produce a quasar other than just the galactic collision itself, so obviously this is just speculation, but it is clear that Quasars are some of the most energetic systems in the Universe; if one were ignited so close to home, would every trace of life in the galaxy go out in a blaze of glory?

134,Why do shooting stars burn close to the ground sometimes?,I saw a shooting star as I was standing on the roof of my home. My home is double storey. And the height of that shooting star that I saw was maybe 10 to 13 meters. It was burned down at that height. My question is why haven't the shooting stars burnt completely when they enter the earth's atmosphere where the air is thick? Why sometimes a small piece gets to come very close to the ground and then burns? 
135,Is it possible to model a solar thermal concentrator using Zernike polynomials?,"This question might seem a bit off-topic, but I guess there are a lot of people here that know about optics, telescopes, etc.   I would like to simulate solar thermal systems that focus solar radiation, e.g. heliostats or dish Stirling. Usually they are simulated using raytracing or Gaussian cone optics.  Basically, I would like to simulate the optical system and get the resulting image of the sun on some surface.  In the end I would like to calculate the ""flux distribution"" (~brightness) of the reflected radiation on some sort of receiver. The receiver could be a plate with heat pipes beneath or a Stirling motor. I would like to create images like [website]So far, I read that Zernike polynomials can only be used to simulate optical systems with circular apertures. This is not the case for my application. Currently I am evaluating the optical system using Monte Carlo raytracing (GPU based) , which yields the very high accuracy that is needed.  We have not done any work on this so far, but for very large mirror arrays, e.g. 25000 heliostats, the raytracer takes quite a while to converge. And calculation time is a very critical point when in comes to optimizing the positions of the mirrors to avoid the shading and blocking amongst them.  This is why we are looking for faster ways to evaluate the optical performance of these systems while still getting highly accurate results.  Do you think it is possible to simulate them using Zernike polynomials? The simulation needs to consider surface errors of the mirrors, astigmatism and non-ideal focal lengths. Can one use Zernike polynomials only for arbitraty optical systems? "
136,What is the current accepted hypothesis of what caused Triton's retrograde orbit around Neptune?,"According to the NASA overview about Triton, this, the largest satellite of Neptune is unique in that it has a retrograde orbit around Neptune.

140,What's that ring that only now appears in black hole illustrations?,"  If you'll notice, space time starts to deform near the black hole, but then at considerable distance from the black hole' surface, images in the background become ultra-distorted, but then as you look even closer to the black hole, the distortion starts to look normal again almost like nothing is happening except for a minor fish-eye lens effect.   If space-time distorts in a monotonic way as you approach the surface of a black hole, how does this ring of ultra-distortion exist? Why doesn't the image look even more distorted at the surface than at that ring? "
141,Why can't different regions of the universe be the same as they have the same origin?,"The horizon problem states that because of the speed of information can't be faster than light and the distances between far regions are too big there is a problem because they look quite the same. Therefor, the inflation is introduced.  But what I don't understand is why those regions can't be the same without inflation or something like that? They have the same origin and the universe was in the beginning too empty to make a difference for the direction you went. So in my simple understanding, it is rather expected that they should be the same but why are cosmologists think different about that? "
142,Is there any support for the Big Crunch Theory? Could there have been a partial Big Crunch in the past?, Is there proof in either the CMB or other observed astronomical phenomena for Big Crunch? Could there have been a partial Big Crunch maybe like a cluster of Black Holes colluding to create a disappearing zone in the Universe?  
143,How to determine the ellipticity of galaxies in SDSS,"What is the best approach to determine the ellipticity of galaxies in the SDSS DR12. I have read this page. Are those really good methods?   Do flux-weighted second moments (as given in the stokes parameters) really give the correct value for ellipticity?   Also I am not sure what table field they actually refer too (in the Galaxy view) when talking about the method using the Adaptive Moments. For example where can I find the m_rr_cc value for the method described here?  Update  I have calculated the ellipticity of a spiral galaxiy with two different methods using data from SDSS DR7. First I used the method using the stokes parameters and second I used the values for isoA and isoB. Both calculations where done in the r-band.   The data can be obtained with the following CAS Query:  SELECT     g.objid as objId,     /*  stoke parameters*/     q_r,u_r,      /*  iso_a, iso_b */     isoA_r,isoB_r FROM Galaxy AS g WHERE     g.objid = 587722982832013381   yielding the result  objId: 587722982832013381    q_r : -0.1206308     u_r: 0.002988584     isoA_r: 169.3949     isoB_r: 84.78848   The ellipticity by stoke parameters is given by  $$ e  = 1 - \frac{b}{a} = 1 - \frac{1 - \sqrt{Q^2 + U^2}}{1 + \sqrt{Q^2 + U^2}}. $$  The ellipticity from isoA and isoB is very given by  $$ e  = 1 - \frac{isoB}{isoA}. $$  But I get completely different results when I use isoA and isoB or the stoke parameters. I get:  ellipticity from stoke parameters: 0.2153498356 ellipticity from 1-(isoA/isoB): 0.4994626166   The results can be reproduced with the following python code:  import math  def ellipticityStokes(q, u):     e = 1 - ((1-math.sqrt((q**2) + (u**2)))/(1+math.sqrt((q**2) + (u**2))))     return e  def ellipticityNormal(a, b):     e = 1 - (b/a)     return e  q = -0.1206308 u = 0.002988584   isoA = 169.3949   isoB = 84.78848  print(str(ellipticityStokes(q,u))) #0.2153498356239003 print(str(ellipticityNormal(isoA,isoB))) #0.4994626166431221   Looking at the image    (and compare with this website from Buta) I would say the value 0.4994626166 (from isoA and isoB) makes more sense. The value calculated from the stokes parameters is just wrong I think.   What is the mistake here? I would expect both calculations to yield similar results.  However for newer data releases isoA and isoB are not available any more because they seem not to trust those value? What should I do with newer data releases as DR12? "

150,Minimum Mass Solar Nebulae Scaling Factors,"I'm attempting to build a MMSN, I've been trying for about... a week to get an intuition on the scaling factors for calculating the mass of the disks, I'm not entirely sure how to think about it. I feel as if the concept is extremely simple but that I'm thinking of it incorrectly. Can someone explain what exactly these scaling factors account for and how one would calculate them? I'm not looking for a solution, I'm looking for intuition on how these scaling factors are found.   My understand is that you pick an element, (Fe), and compare that to the solar abundance (does this mean the abundance of Fe in the sun? From there I would look at the abundance of Fe in the cores of the planet and compare them somehow to get some sort of scaling factor. From what I understand Fe makes .14% of the suns mass, so if I know lets say that neptune has a mass of 17m(earth) how would I start finding the scaling factor.   Thanks!  "
151,Is the American Astronomical Society 230 years old?,"The BBC News item Light shed on mystery space radio pulses is interesting enough in its own right. But I noticed that it is reporting on news from the 231st meeting of the American Astronomical Society.  These kinds of meetings are usually annual; for example the 120th Annual meeting of the American Physical Society will be in 2019.  Were there enough astronomers in the US in 1787 to have an American Astronomical Society and it's first meeting?  If it turns out that the answer is that meetings were more frequent than annual, why would that be?  "

155,What conditions would lead to this event around the black hole in the Pictor A galaxy?,"  This is a picture of a jet of particles exiting the supermassive black hole in the center of Pictor A galaxy at nearly the speed of light. Source  This event is supposedly created from a black hole of 40 million solar masses. The full quote here:     The newly released picture shows the terrifying power of an actual   supermassive black hole located in the galaxy Pictor A, some 500   million light years distant.  This black hole is about 40 million   times the mass of the Sun (that’s about 10 times larger than the black   hole at the center of our own galaxy), and if it were to replace the   Sun within our Solar System, its event horizon would swallow the   orbits of both Mercury and Venus.   Now a quick search to Wikipedia would show a abundance of supermassive black holes many, many times larger than that supermassive black hole as well as a few that are around the same mass as that.  To my question: What set of special conditions that surround this particular supermassive black hole such that it is capable of creating this spectacular event?  Edit for clarity: By this I meant the jet and the hotspot. "
156,What is the formula to predict lunar and solar eclipses accurately?,"A number of ancient civilizations had devised methods to predict exact dates and times of such eclipses, marking them as important events. Hence I assume the predictions were based on calculations, which should be quite easy to do now. So what is the exact formula to predict the exact date and time(this is optional, but desirable) of lunar and solar eclipses? Also how to calculate if the solar eclipse will be visible from a particular location or not? "
157,Is it fruitful to search for a correlation between rates of in-falling matter in black holes and the expansion rate of our universe?,"To my understanding, white holes are hypothetical objects that are time-reversed black holes; black holes gravitationally ""suck in"" matter whereas white holes ""spit"" matter back out. As such, I think it's a nice idea that the Big Bang could be the ""spitting of matter"" via a white hole (assuming such an object exists).   This got me wondering how one could experimentally test for such an object. Since the expansion rate of the universe is increasing, could one possible explanation be that a white hole is continually ""spitting out"" matter such that an increase of flux of in-falling matter/space could be observed as an increasing rate of expansion of out-pouring matter/space? While I don't know of a way to detect this, I was wondering whether the following idea was fruitful or not.   Given that a supermassive black hole is believed to be at the center of every galaxy, given that most galaxies (sans Andromeda) are receding away at a speed proportional to their distance relative to us observers, and given that the spatial distribution of matter in our universe is isotropic and homogeneous, could one build a simulation of such a concept? To emulate isotropy and homogeneity, one could use a random number generator corresponding to a uniform distribution to place ""galaxies"" along a grid; accounting for gravitational forces, one can simulate the time-evolution of these galaxies and compare rates of in-falling matter to find a correlation between the rate of in-falling matter and the expansion rate of the universe (likely as a function of time-elapsed, and age and size per black hole). While the simulation does not definitely prove anything, providing a correlation could be interesting in my opinion.  Is this a stupid idea, or is there a potential to build upon this idea? If it is not fruitful, I am curious as to why. "

159,How do we know the order of the new Trappist-1 planets?,"Using transit photometry astronomers were able to discover Trappist b through h. Based on this question we learn that the naming of planets is based on their distance from their star (b being the closest).  But how do we actually determine the distance from the star? From my understanding with transit photometry we basically just see a shadow against the backdrop of the star. That can tell us the planet exists, but how do we know the distance between the planet and the star? "
160,Impact of Atmospheric Water vapour on Optical Observations,I would like to ask; how does Water Vapour in the atmosphere interfere with astronomical observations? Is it in the same manner as Carbon dioxide?    What brought this to mind is the following: A member of Monash University staff claimed recently in a newspaper in Australia that both CO2 and H2O absorbed heat and hence their presence needed to be reduced for astronimical observations. Hence the siting of optical observatories on mountain tops where the absolute amount of water vapour in the atmosphere is reduced by the relatively low temperatures there. 
161,Why do pre-main sequence stars show lithium in absorption?,"This paper and this paper state without discussion that the presence of lithium absorption in the stars they observe as strong evidence of these stars being pre-main sequence stars. Because they state this without any discussion and justification, I assume that it's a commonly known and accepted fact.  The second of the two papers also state without discussion or justification that some observed strong H[tex] emission was also evidence of the stars being pre-main sequence stars.  Googling around I was able to get a partial answer for why this is so.  Pre-main sequence stars retain their primordial lithium as they collapse, but at some point around when they become main sequence stars, the lithium in their photospheres is destroyed by fusing with protons. I haven't been able to find anything describing why H[tex] emission is associated with pre-main sequence stars, other than this has been known for a very long time (since before at least 1945).  I am wondering   What is it about becoming a main sequence star that causes the lithium to fuse with protons near the surface? How fast is the lithium destroyed, and does this destruction occur right when the star enters the main sequence?  I'm wondering how definite the presence of lithium absorption is in saying whether a star has entered the main sequence or not. Why is H[tex] emission such a prominent feature of pre-main sequence stars?  "
162,Can a bullet be fired on the moon and sent it into orbit?,"I know you need oxygen for the ignition, but presumably, if the bullet is impervious (or water-tight) and if there is a little air enclosed in the bullet case, wouldn't that be sufficient to fire it ?   And, giving the speed, would that be enough/too much to send it into orbit around the moon ? Would you need to fire it at a certain angle ?(which will presumably make it an elliptic orbit) "
163,Orbital plane evolution and planet discovery via transit method,"I'm aware that our solar system is largely/roughly on a single orbital plane, but haven't other star system's orbital planes been scrambled by billions of years of interaction?

164,Is it possible for any of the planets in the TRAPPIST-1 system to have moons?,All of the planets in the TRAPPIST-1 system are all orbiting very closely and are somewhat large. Would it be possible for at least one of the planets to have a stable moon in orbit around it?

166,How does moonrise/moonset azimuth vary with time?,"In my tenacious attempts to observe moonrise (surprisingly difficult in a poor weather heavily urbanized hilly area with frequent bad smog, with busy work schedule and a bicycle) I was frequently trying to find good observation spots that would provide view to open distant horizon at specific azimuth.  While generally similar moon phases correlated with similar moonrise times I found the azimuth to vary in a way I have a difficult time to put my finger on. Sure there's a roughly monthly cycle of ""wobble"" between deviating about +/- 30 degrees north or south from ""pure east"" but while the mechanics of correlation between hour when the Moon is visible from behind the horizon and the degree it's lit by the sun are quite clear to me, the way its - or is it Earth's? - orbital plane is ""off"" relative to the ecliptic plane and Earth rotation plane eludes me. Could someone provide a sort of guide - preferably something that acts more as help in understanding the mechanics, as opposed to providing raw mathematical solutions, what does this deviation depend on, and how it changes with time? "
167,"Finding a location geographically of a celestial object, in this case the moon at one of its quarters","Years ago it was mentioned to me the New Yorker magazine had a Young Moon “contest”; who could find the youngest moon; the thinnest crescent after a new moon. I knew enough to know that I would have to know exactly when the new moon occurred and more importantly where. The Thin Crescent wouldn’t be too hard as it would follow closely the sun. Still, not knowing where the new moon happened meant that I could see anything from nothing to a one day old moon. I knew the moon traversed about 13 degrees of arc a day in so doing about 7% Of its disc was illuminated so my chance of seeing a very thin crescent depended on the new moon happening to the east of me by some 6 to 12 hours, as the “record” was something in the realm of 9hours.  So the question arose in me “Where on the globe would an observer see any of the quarterly phases exactly over their meridian?” This question led to almanacs that used hours, minutes, seconds and hundredths of seconds of measurements, all starting from the celestial spheres Greenwich or zero longitude, the Vernal Equinox, that semi-fixed(a 26,000 year cycle) starting place for celestial longitude. My question is, how can I find and use that “exact” beginning zero “longitude?  I am being hobbled here by being forced to use the very nomenclature I don’t understand. I mean I understand it, it’s simple enough, I just don’t know where to start. How do I find right ascension 18h23m52.34s on the celestial sphere? Is there a bright star at the vernal equinox that is used to fix that spot in the sky?  I begin to think I’m communicating with a machine that can’t extrapolate...no matter, as long as I get an education. Ok then here’s a question: how can I find right ascention(ra)18h 23m 52s standing out in the desert some night? I don’t need declination as the object is large and I’ll know it when I see it.  "
168,How do stars or galaxies get their spin?,"It is my understanding that when a star, a planetary disk, or a galaxy forms, the rotational momentum of the whole system is conserved.   Due to the smaller size of the resulting object, it will spin with a significantly higher speed than the original nebula.  What I do not understand is where the original rotation comes from. Why should a random dust cloud have an overall spin? Wouldn't the impulses of all particles in the cloud tend to average each other out?  Is there some alternative source of spin or a reason why nebula have an inherent spin? "
169,How long have the TRAPPIST-1 planets been in a habitable zone?,"The planets orbiting TRAPPIST-1 are in orbits around their star much closer than Earth orbits Sol. However, since TRAPPIST-1 is a cool brown dwarf, some of the planets are in an ""inhabitable zone"", where the temperature would not be too extreme for life as we know it.  What I wonder is, how long have those planets been in an inhabitable zone? The wikipedia page says that TRAPPIST-1 is older than 1 Gyr. But, how much of that time has it been a cool brown dwarf?  In other words, since the abiogenesis of life and the evolution of living organisms has dependency on time, how much time has life had a chance to develop in the star's habitable zone?  For this question, I'm not concerned about the chemistry or other characteristics of the planets themselves. "

175,What is the current routine of modern astronomy?,"With about all visible stars catalogued, measured and photographed it seems that chapter is closed. I realize currently while amateur astronomy is big on cataloguing all asteroids in the Solar System, the ""Big Boys"" are now primarily busy with discovery of extrasolar planets. But that's certainly not all. Sure there's a lot of unique research, new, unexpected discoveries, assorted ""odd"" research like SETI, and so on, but I'd like to know what is the ""daily bread"" of every astronomer nowadays?  What are the current typical, routine tasks of an average professional astronomer? What is being observed/measured/searched for? What challenges occupy most effort and time?

180,"In galaxy optical spectra, why are Hbeta and Hdelta sometimes absorption lines?","I've heard that [tex] and [tex] lines in galaxy spectra might be either emission lines or absorption lines, is that correct?  From Wikipedia, Balmer lines are usually emission lines in the spectra of spiral and irregular galaxies probably due to the presence of type A stars.

184,Retrograde motion and Kuiper Belt Objects,"As seen from Earth, planets such as Mars and Jupiter exhibit retrograde motion when they are near opposition (from Earth).  I am wondering how this effect extends to very distant objects, such as those in the Kuiper Belt.    Since objects in the Kuiper Belt orbit the Sun at a velocity much slower than Earth (or Mars or Jupiter for that matter) because of Kepler's third law I'd imagine that retrograde motion for these objects is more extreme in the sense that these objects are seen to be in retrograde motion for a longer time and over a larger portion of the sky (in an angular sense) than would be seen for any of the planets.  In an extreme case, is it possible that a very distant Kuper Belt Object (KBO) would never be observed in prograde motion?  I imagine that if you were to observe a KBO that was in the direction of Earth's motion then there would be no contribution from the Earth's velocity on the observation and you would be able to see the object in prograde motion, no matter how slow it was travelling. However, such an object would likely be obscured by sunlight, since objects that lie in the direction of Earth's motion lie above the day/night interface on the Earth.  My question here is that, given real-life observational constraints (like sunlight) how far from the Sun would an object have to be to never be seen in prograde motion?  You can be mathematical. "

This is approximately what I had in mind:  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  How do I build something like that? I'm primarily interested in observing sunspots, but would also like to know, if there is any way for me to safely observe Sun's coronal activity to any appreciable detail with an enthusiast grade newtonian/dobsonian telescope?

"
190,What area of Proxima Centauri would need to be occluded for the effect to be observable on Earth?,"One of ideas of how Breakthrough Starshot could communicate data from Proxima Centauri is to have a massive swarm of the solar sail powered craft to pivot (with their sails) synchronously, taking either 'sideways' or 'head on' orientation to the star - in effect either obstructing it or revealing for an observer 'behind' - on Earth. If the swarm is big enough, it would cause an observable dimming of the star - and timing the pivots right it could encode data in the star's visible luminosity.  The primary question of viability of this idea lies in 'how big a swarm?'. What percentage, or what absolute area or a star like Proxima would need to be occluded for the effect to be observable? We can notice transition of exoplanets quite reliably so that would be the upper bound, but what's the smallest object area that would make a detectable difference? "

192,What effect does time dilation have on bodies orbiting close to Black Holes?,"As far as my (somewhat basic) knowledge of astrophysics goes in general the closer to a star your orbit gets smaller (because you travel less distance) and faster (because you're deeper in the gravity well and need to go quicker to avoid falling in.)  But what happens on bodies orbiting close to black holes and subject to time dilation as far as an external observer is concerned?  This question isn't about interstellar but it's a good point of reference. Take the water planet they drop onto where gravitational time dilation is enough to make 20 or 30 years pass to the external observers while only a few hours pass for them. (I don't know if this is a realistic rate(?) of time dilation.)  What would the apparent orbit of their planet be to the external orbit and what would his orbit appear to be for them? Even though he is further from the star would he complete more orbits in the elapsed time despite being further from the centre of the system? And would they appear to be orbiting ""slower"" than him from his point of view.  Out of interest, though perhaps a second question is more appropriate, how would the apparent difference in relative orbital speed affect rendezvous manoeuvres if at all?  For example would the standard decelerate and fall into a lower orbit still apply but the trajectory plotted from a static observer look weird as time dilation set in? Or would the manoeuvre have to be different to account for the apparent velocity difference? What would a non-circular orbit look like in this system when observed from a circular orbit?  Also is the velocity required for orbit so close to a black hole high enough that speed based relativity also comes into play? "

200,Is the universe always expanding,"Currently we observe that the universe is expanding. And this expansion even goes faster and faster.  Why do we know (or presume) that this expansion started slowly at a singularity (i.e. big bang) and is getting faster and faster?  Did a serious scientist ever presumed that the universe might be oscillating, i.e. like a breathing bubble? Currently the universe is expanding but who knows, perhaps in 1 Million year we will observe a shrinking universe and 3 Million year later again expanding - provided the humans will still exist at this time which I doubt.  Of course, this would open many new questions like: How and when did it start? What is the frequency and amplitude? But let's keep this question off side. "

205,How does the Gamma Ray Burst that occurred when 2 black holes merged compare to other GRB's?,"A Gamma Ray Burst was detected 0.4 seconds after the gravitational wave event, GW150914, caused by a black hole merger, and it was in the same part of the sky. It is uncertain whether that Gamma Ray Burst was associated with the black hole merger. The odds of a GRB being coincident (or just background noise) is 0.22%. That implies a 99.78% chance the black hole merger was related to the GRB. Later analysis suggests the GRB was just a background event that occurred in the same place in the sky at just 0.4 seconds after the black hole merger, and therefore not related.  While a GRB may have relativistic jets beaming out from it in opposite directions, research ""excludes the possibility that the event is associated with substantial gamma-ray radiation, directed towards the observer."" I interpret that to mean this GRB did not have relativistic jets, but was omnidirectional. (Not sure how astronomers came to that conclusion.)  Anyhow, whether it was coincident or not, I am asking about how the energy output of that GRB compares to other GRB's. The Wikipedia article in the link says the ""energy emission in gamma-rays and hard X-rays from the event was less than one millionth of the energy emitted as gravitational waves.""  How much energy does a typical GRB emit? What was the spectrum spread of a typical GRB? Over what amount of time does a typical GRB emit that energy? (How many seconds?)  How do the energy levels, spectrums, and time durations of other GRB's compare to the GRB associated with the black hole merger?  If it is similar to other GRB's, that would support the hypothesis this GRB was just a coincident event at nearly the same time and location in the sky.  If this GRB has different energy emissions and time duration than other GRB's, that would support the hypothesis it is truly associated with the black hole merger.  When you answer, please provide data, citations, or quotes from original research. I am not looking for unsupported speculation, but real analysis supported by real data. "

207,Why black holes have positive energy?,"How could Hawking get the conclusion ""[...] and black holes have positive energy. That’s why empty space is stable. Bodies such as stars or black holes cannot just appear out of nothing. But a whole universe can.""? It would make sense to me, if a black hole has negative energy.  Quote from book The Grand Design, page 180:     If the total energy of the universe must always remain zero, and it costs energy to create a body, how can a whole universe be created from nothing? That is why there must be a law like gravity. Because gravity is attractive, gravitational energy is negative: One has to do work to separate a gravitationally bound system, such as the earth and moon. This negative energy can balance the positive energy needed to create matter, but it’s not quite that simple. The negative gravitational energy of the earth, for example, is less than a billionth of the positive energy of the matter particles the earth is made of. A body such as a star will have more negative gravitational energy, and the smaller it is (the closer the different parts of it are to each other), the greater this negative gravitational energy will be. But before it can become greater than the positive energy of the matter, the star will collapse to a black hole, and black holes have positive energy. That’s why empty space is stable. Bodies such as stars or black holes cannot just appear out of nothing. But a whole universe can.  "
208,Theoretical sudden appearance of a black hole in BBC drama show *spoiler warning*,"I asked this on the ‘movies’ stackexchange site but they suggested I ask here, it’s a purely hypothetical query based on a BBC drama show called ‘Hard Sun’, feel free to kill the question if it’s inappropriate here.  In the TV show’s series finale an expected ‘extinction level event’ happens and appears to be a black hole close to our sun, it already has developed a spiral of hot gas around it drawn from the sun.  Clearly this is fiction but I’m keen to understand just how badly-considered this is. Firstly the show is set in London and everyone seems amazed when the image below rises from the dusk yet clearly it's been in existence for the time taken to create the spiral (hours at least?) so nations east of the UK would have seen it for that time and reported on it globally surely?  My real question is more around is there any potential scenario where a black hole of that size could develop suddenly and get to that size quickly enough for that image to be a surprise? My understanding, very much as a scientific-layman, is that a black hole of that size would have to have the mass of at least one of our suns to get to that size (probably more) - is that a valid assumption? If so where has the mass come from? Also wouldn't the sudden existence of something else with at least the same mass as our sun suddenly appearing at the centre of our solar system have enormous gravitational impact on everything in the system, including Earth? We'd have massive volcanic/tectonic impact wouldn't we?  So again sorry if this is inappropriate, I was just incredulous at how badly-considered the scientific aspects of this fiction were and wanted to check that my understandings were correct.

Like discovering a new massive object (moon or even planet etc.), or that a planet area is habitable   I was assuming it’s very unlikely because we have good measures and models (gravity based or other means I guess) but those few papers (sorry I didn’t bookmark them) have me wonder. How much do we really know of our nearest environment, before looking at interstellar stuff?  "
210,What is the science behind the polar light shapes,"Is there any scientific explanation that causes polar lights (aurora borealis/australis) to have their unique shapes?  Specifically:   Rayed Arcs Dual Bands Corona   (Images on NASA Pdf)  This site (by NASA) proposes:     The different shapes of auroras are a mystery that scientists are still trying to    unravel. The shape seems to depend on where in the magnetosphere the electrons    originate, what causes them to gain their energy, and why they dive into the    atmosphere.   (Subsection: Why do auroras come in different colors and shapes?)  I am specifically asking if there are any scientific observations (formulas or even simulations) that could describe such patterns (or even similar observations from fluid or gas dynamics). Furthermore, if it forms a rippled ring for instance, there should be a wave-like function, right?  Afterall, they could also be in a straight line..  Aurora - NASA Pdf "

212,"If the earth was not tilted, what would be the north star?","What is earth tipped toward? The simple answer is Polaris.  The axis (one end of it) points at Polaris, so that's what it's tipped to point at.  But when we saw ""toward"" what do we mean? When it is tipped ""toward"" one thing, what is it being tipped ""away from""?  If earth were not tipped then the equator would lie in the same plane as earth's orbit.  Earth being tipped 23 degrees means it is tipped 23 degrees ""away from"" alignment with its orbit.  So a 0 degree tip would be ""not tipped"" and a 23 degree tip is tipped 23 degrees in some direction.  What direction is it tipped in?  Another way to ask this would be, what would it be tipped at if it was tipped a full 90 degrees in the general direction in which it is currently tipped 23 degrees?  Imagine a coordinate system with two axes in the plane of earth's orbit and one axis perpendicular to that plane.  Earth's orbit stays in the plane, and the angle that earth is tipped points to, let's say, negative X.  So the line through the north pole and south pole lies in the XY plane and the earth's orbit lies in the XZ plane.  I want to look at stars and be able to see those axes, so I want to know what stars they roughly point at.  A cleaner way to ask this might be, what would be the north star if earth wasn't tipped? What would be the south star? What if it was tipped 90 degrees? That gives four of the six stars I'm looking for. I'm not sure how to phrase the question for the other two.  I want to call these stars ""untipped north"", ""untipped south"", ""winter"", ""summer"", ""spring"", and ""fall"" because the direction of the stars would be the same as the direction earth is from the sun during the extremes of those seasons (northern hemisphere).  [EDIT]  The plane of earth's orbit is aligned with a celestial (infinitely distant) great circle called the ecliptic.  It inversely happens to also be the path through the sky that the sun takes over the course of a year.  There is a latitude/longitude coordinate system where the equator is the ecliptic called ""ecliptic coordinates"".  So the question is actually:  Using ecliptic latitude and longitude, what 6 stars are at:   0, 0 0, 90 0, 180 0, -90 90, 0 -90, 0  "

215,"Moons of migrated giant planets: Icy, Rocky, or none at all?","My understanding is that gas and ice giants form outside the ""snow line"" of their protoplanetary disk, then sometimes through gravitational interactions they are able to migrate into the inner star system.   In this situation, if the giant planet had moons, what would they be like?   Would the planet be able to bring initial moons with it? Or would they be lost? If they are kept, are they likely to retain an icy composition due to forming outside the snowline? If not, can it form or capture new moons post-migration?  "
216,Using setting circle for Right Ascension,"I'm a little bit confused about the setting circle of my EQ5 mount. Basically, I'm trying to find M42 nebula using Sirius star as reference. So, considere that I did the following steps:  A) Polar aligned for south pole B) Pointed the telescope to Sirius star C) Adjusted the RA wheel to 6h45m and DEC wheel to -16º42'   Now, I want to view the M42 nebula basing only in the RA and DEC wheels (without using the finderscope or whatever).   Then, I did:  D) Changed the coordinates in the EQ5 mount to match RA 5h35m and DEC -5º23 E) Spent 5 minutes performing the step above (D) F) Looked in the eyepiece   So my questions are:   1) After doing all these steps above, will the M42 nebula be 5 minutes away from the center of my eyepiece? So instead of using RA 5h35m I will need to use RA 5h40m?(??)  2) If yes, will I need to perform all the above steps every time that I want to see a new object? I mean, as fast as I can, to minimize the RA error...  3) And if the answer is yes again to Question (2), how useful is the setting circle under these conditions for you?

218,Calculate the time when Arcturus passed through the meridian,"   If the observer observes Arcturus passed through the meridian about 23:00:00 of 28 April. Find the time that Arcturus passed the meridian in 29 April. And what day does the Arcturus will pass the meridian about 01:00:00?   I think that when Arcturus passed through the meridian, the hour angle will be 0 degree. Sidereal time equal hour angle plus right ascension. right ascention of any stars always be the same. So Sidereal time will be as same as every times while the star located at the meridian. And it doesn't matter because solar time equal sidereal time minus 12hr. Do I understand something wrong? And how do I do this question?  Adding question;  Your answer was very clear. But if I consider about the moon instead ex; the observer is at the equator and saw the moon which has a declination of 0 degree set at 11:00 PM yesterday, what time the observer will see the moon set today? I try to use the thinking process like this again. I know that the sidereal month of the moon is 27.32166 days. I calculate the solar month of the moon from 365.24219 of solar year divided by 12, and I get 30.43684 days per solar month. From subtracting both of these numbers, I get 3 days plus about 2 hours 45 minutes and 52 seconds. So to answer this question I will get 2 hours 45 minutes 52 seconds behind. My answer is that I will see the moon set at 13:45:52 PM. Do I right? I don't understand why the time I get is behind instead of earlier as the question about the Arcturus I asked before. I'm also not sure that does the declination of the moon and the position of the observer relate or not too. Thank you very much:) "
219,Relationship between metallicity and color? Should Pop. I stars be blue?,"I have found in numerous places such as this website: [website]  Population I:    metal rich [Fe/H] > -1    disk stars    open clusters    metal rich makes stars redder      Population II   metal poor [Fe/H] &lt; -1     halo stars   globular clusters    metal poor makes stars bluer   And I also found (from: [website]  Population I stars include the sun and tend to be luminous, hot and young, concentrated in the disks of spiral galaxies. They are particularly found in the spiral arms. With the model of heavy element formation in supernovae, this suggests that the gas from which they formed had been seeded with the heavy elements formed from previous giant stars. About 2% of the total belong to Population I.      Population II stars tend to be found in globular clusters and the nucleus of a galaxy. They tend to be older, less luminous and cooler than Population I stars. They have fewer heavy elements, either by being older or being in regions where no heavy-element producing predecessors would be found. Astronomers often describe this condition by saying that they are ""metal poor"", and the ""metallicity"" is used as an indication of age.   If Population I stars are metal rich and therefore appear red, how can they be luminous, hot, and young, and concentrated in disk (the region of star formation)? Shouldn't they appear blue? How does color relate to metallicity?  Hot stars should be blue, shouldn't they? As stated here for example:     A star’s color is critical in identifying the star, because it tells us the star’s surface temperature in the black body radiation scale. The sun has a surface temperature of 5,500 K, typical for a yellow star. Red stars are cooler than the sun, with surface temperatures of 3,500 K for a bright red star and 2,500 K for a dark red star. The hottest stars are blue, with their surface temperatures falling anywhere between 10,000 K and 50,000 K. ([website]Also, this question is a little similar but not quite: Metal rich or metal poor?  There is a graph: [website]I'm not sure if the colors there correspond to the colors of the stars, but they used blue to refer to old stars. Why? "

222,Problem with denoising the BICEP2 data?,"This question pertains to this article which talks about why the BICEP2 measurements of B-mode polarization in Cosmic microwave background radiation turned out to be noise from galactic stardust. They go on to add that the Plank data of the noise does not lend to getting a good B-mode estimate from the BICEP2 data.     However, the results of the joint assessment would suggest that   whatever signal BICEP2 detected, it cannot be separated at any   significant level from the spoiling effects. In other words, the   original observations are equally compatible with there being no   primordial gravitational waves. ""This joint work has shown that the   detection of primordial B-modes is no longer robust once the emission   from galactic dust is removed,"" Jean-Loup Puget, principal   investigator of Panck's HFI instrument, said in the Esa statement.   ""So, unfortunately, we have not been able to confirm that the signal   is an imprint of cosmic inflation.""   Can someone explain why(from a signal processing perspective) exactly the detection of primordial B-modes is not robust even after the emission from galactic dust is removed? And what are the proposed workarounds to tackle this problem? "
223,Can we see the stars at the edge of the Milkyway?,"This question proved much more difficult to formulate than I initially imagined. It concerns how far out in the Milky Way that we actually see with different telescopes. I know the Milky Way disk is about 100k light years wide, its halo a couple of times that wide, and most of the naked eye stars are within 1000 light years. I also know that when many stars are close together they are more visible, which means we can easily see for example the double cluster in Perseus at about 7000 light years with our naked eyes. But if you take a large telescope and peer into the distance, how easily do you see through the star fields until the point where you have no more foreground stars in the field of view, and all that is there are the numerous faint galaxies lurking in the back. For example, in the Hubble Deep field you see a few stars. Are we looking at the last few stars at the edge of the Milky Way, or are there more hidden in the field that we can't see because they are too far away/too faint?  I realize that there are dust clouds in the Milky Way obscuring the view, so if you look towards the galactic center you would definitely not see all the way to the other side. But lets assume we're looking perpendicular to the galactic plane. Lets also say that you're using a 16"" telescope, allowing you to see maybe down to the 15th magnitude. Do you see the stars at the edge of the galaxy?  Another way of approaching the question... From what I've read it seems we estimate the Milky Way to contain about 250 billion stars. I also read that the Gaia satellite will map about 1 billion stars. Does that mean our best telescopes are only able to discern 1/250 of the stars in the Milky Way? Of course all stars on the other side the galaxy disk are hidden from us, so they surely account for a large portion of the invisible stars. But looking straight up from the galactic plane, can we see the last galactic stars before the empty intergalactic ""void""? "
224,"What can be learned from, or noted in this LIGO Orrery video?","The Ars Technica article Physicists detected gravitational waves from four new black-hole mergers notes that     This brings the total number of events detected by LIGO and Virgo to 11.

Our goal is the simulation of black holes and other extreme spacetimes to gain a better understanding of Relativity, and the physics of exotic objects in the distant cosmos.   so quite a substantial amount of math and physics went into this work.  But as an outsider I don't really understand what I'm looking at.

Edit: thank you to barycarter for bringing to attention that the Kepler binary stars would look like one star from the surface of their planets. However, there must be, somewhere, a binary system where both stars are visible, such that the shadows are affected.

Is it deduced from the orbits of the various comets? I think so.  Why it does not spread into a more disk like object?  "
233,What would the tides on the Trappist-1 planets be like?,"In the recent press conference about the planets orbiting around Trappist-1, one of the astronomers mentioned that the planets are close enough to each other that the tidal forces between planets are non-negligible. Supposing there were oceans on 1, 2 or all 3 of the planets in the habitable zone. What would the tides on these planets look like?  Because the dynamics of planet-planet interactions would be quite different from a planet-moon interaction, the tides would be far more complicated than a sinusoidal low-tide/high-tide at any given point on the planet. The abstract of the Nature paper on these planets states:     The six inner planets form a near-resonant chain, such that their orbital periods (1.51, 2.42, 4.04, 6.06, 9.1 and 12.35 days) are near-ratios of small integers.   What effect would this have on the tides? How powerful would the tides be? "
234,Entropy of black hole,"A line from one of the answers on a different question got me thinking:     The simplest way to see this is probably that a black hole has a much   higher entropy than a star or even another type of stellar remnant of   even vaguely similar mass and so there simply could not exist a   spontaneous process by which a black hole develops back into a star.   Now, I agree a black hole turning into a star seems far-fetched since it's a one-way trip (like you can't recover a block of sugar from a glass of water to that exact form). But as far as I know entropy is the amount of disorder. A black hole is denser than a star. For a density that high, I assume a certain amount of order (inverse entropy?) is required. It's an enormous amount of mass in a small amount of space, keeping itself together. Sounds to me like a system, not like a random collection of mass.  How can the amount of order necessary for such dense objects as black holes be lower than that of the star they originate from? "

He said that gravity waves can be used to detect objects that cannot be seen using telescopes. Therefore, could gravity wave detectors be used to confirm the existence of the theorized ninth planet? Even though it doesn't have a high enough albedo to be seen, it would still be detectable gravitationally, wouldn't it? "
236,Difference in Ephemerides Position:- PlanEph 4.2 (VSOP87) vs JPL Horizons (DE431),"I have obtained the hindcast position of Mercury relative to the Sun for the epoch 2000-Jan-01 12:00:00 using two methods: PlanEph ver 4.2 (Dos-based) and JPL Horizons DE431 (online).  The two methods give positions which are over 2000 Km apart.   Details are presented in the following figure:-    I presume that such a large discrepancy is due to some error of specification or understanding on my part.

238,Star revolving a star,Are there any star system(planet system) where a star revolves around a star? Is it theoretically possible? 
239,What will happen when landing on Jupiter?,"Jupiter is a gas giant, so landing on it will not be like landing on Earth, our Moon or Mars etc., as it does not have a solid surface like these.  If we have a hypothetical spaceship or probe landing on Jupiter, and it can withstand the enormous pressure, what or how will be the sequence of events?  I already read this:     A major problem in sending space probes to Jupiter is that the planet   has no solid surface on which to land, as there is a smooth transition   between the planet's atmosphere and its fluid interior. Any probes   descending into the atmosphere are eventually crushed by the immense   pressures within Jupiter.   What I do not understand:   Is this enormous or immense pressure of atmosphere or Jupiter's surface? While descending, will we know that we have transitioned from the atmosphere to the surface? Why does animated footage (real or conceptual) of Jupiter appear like a high viscous liquid (e.g. lava) rotating in an opposite direction, rather that gas(es)? Does Jupiter have an inner solid core?     I've already gone through these:   Is Jupiter made entirely out of gas? Could we fly/drive through Jupiter? If Jupiter is a gas-giant then why don't its features change?  "
240,Equinox sunrise sunset direction,"Looking at sunrise and sunset data around 2017 vernal equinox (because of GMT timezone I took London) [website]Date  Sunrise      Sunset        Day Length  Solar Noon 16    06:12 (92°)  18:07 (269°)  11:54:55    12:09 (37.0°) 17    06:09 (91°)  18:08 (269°)  11:58:53    12:08 (37.4°) 18    06:07 (90°)  18:10 (270°)  12:02:52    12:08 (37.8°) 19    06:05 (90°)  18:12 (271°)  12:06:50    12:08 (38.2°) 20    06:03 (89°)  18:13 (271°)  12:10:48    12:07 (38.6°) 21    06:00 (88°)  18:15 (272°)  12:14:47    12:07 (39.0°) 22    05:58 (88°)  18:17 (273°)  12:18:45    12:07 (39.3°)   We see that 12-hours day happens around 17-18 of March, however the Vernal Equinox takes place on 20 March 2017, 10:29 GMT.  I understand that due to refraction in the Earth's atmosphere and due to the fact that sunrises and sunsets are defined by the top of the Sun's disk, sunrises are ""earlier"" and sunsets are ""later"", so the 12-hours day indeed should happen before the equinox.  But why the directions of sunrise and sunset are east--west on that same day? The above factors should not influence directions, should they? "
241,"How precisely is planetary tilt defined (the tilt direction, not just the angle)?","The earth's axis is titled 23.4 degrees with respect to the ecliptic. Since this tilt is responsible for the seasons, it's clear that the tilt is in the direction away from the sun on the shortest day of year in the winter (on the northern hemisphere). That uniquely defines the tilt direction for me. How do we define the tilt direction for the other planets, though? What is the proper way of determining in what direction the tilt of a planet occurs? "
242,How does gravity have an effect from the inside the event horizon of a black hole with the rest of the universe?,"According to general relativity, as I understand it, the space around a black hole's event horizon is distorted by gravity, such that the distance to a point approaching the event horizon from an observational point further out from the EH approaches infinity.  So if the distance to any mass inside the EH appears to be infinite, how does this mass assert gravitational effects outside the EH?  Perhaps a different question, what is the difference between the gravitational effects of a mass inside the EH of a black hole and a similar mass that is outside the cosmic event horizon of an observational point? "
243,Why are gas giants colored the way they are?,"As I understand it, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune are all made primarily from varying proportions of hydrogen and helium.  Despite this, Jupiter is very red, Saturn is yellow, and Uranus and Neptune are blue.  Why the difference in colors for planets with similar chemical makeups?  Or do they not have similar chemical makeups?  If such an explanation is available, I would like specific descriptions of why each planet is colored the way it is. "

245,What methods exist to calculate the ellipticity of galaxies,What methods exist to calculate the ellipticity of galaxies and what are their drawbacks? I have asked this question about ellipticity in the SDSS but I want to know about general methods for cases where I have just an image of a galaxy.  I do so far know these methods:   ellipticity from stoke parameters or the flux-weighted second moment as described here.  from adaptive moments as described here (which would allow me to do shear calibration). fit an ellipse on a particular isophote as decribed here.   My question is whether there are further methods I am not aware of. Does there also exist a method when I fit an ellipse to all isophotes? And how would I calculate the 'average' from it (such that the spherical center does not contribute to much)?  I would like to learn about the pro and cons of each method. I am especially interessted in methods that get close to what people would estimate by eye. I would also be glad to hear about references (textbooks or papers) for the different methods.  
246,Why are all quasars so far away?,"Why are all quasars so far away?  If the universe is homogeneous, we could expect to have a homogeneous distribution of quasars, but all of then seem to be far away from Earth. Why is that? "
247,What does the 'amplification factor' of gravitational microlensing mean?,"At first I assumed the amplification factor meant an increase in brightness. But since the equation: [tex] is independent of mass, this make no sense to me. Wouldn't everything be infinity magnified (if its mass independent empty space should work, right)? Even if its simply not valid for a zero mass, everything would be amplified by an arbitrarily high amount any time even a neutrino passes arbitrarily close to the right [tex]? But if its not brightness, I don't know what signal is being amplified. "
248,What should I expect to see with my telescope with what EP's?,"Recently got a Celestron 130 SLT (first ""real"" scope) and have a question. I have the following:  130mm F/5 newtonian, 650mm focal length scope  9 and 25mm factory EP's (more on that later)  Svbony 2x barlow  Very, very dark skies (100 miles from any cities, out in the desert, light pollution maps show ""zero light pollution"" on the maps anywhere I view from once I'm 5 minutes from home). I don't have expensive glass, I don't know what I'm doing... but at least I have this going for me :-)   4500 elevation with low mountains on either side, 10-25 miles away  (don't know that it matters)   20/20 uncorrected vision (if that makes a difference)  I am curious what I should expect to be able to see with my scope, and at what magnification I should see them at? I plan to buy 3 EP's, and want to know the lowest and highest I should buy to see what I ""should"" be seeing. I don't want to pursue things that I won't be able to make out clearly anyways, or buy the wrong EP's for seeing those things. I see anywhere from 25 to 60 X your scope size, which is a wide range of mags.   I have beautifully-dark skies, so I'm not sure if the EP has to do with light pollution also, or solely ""seeing"".   Will I be able to make out cassini's division? Will I be able to complete the messier list?   I have nothing in-person to compare my scope to, so I'm relying on random internet information, which tells me my max magnification is anywhere from 150 to 250, and varying features and objects that I will be able to see. Any input will be greatly appreciated. I plan to start the lunar observing program soon (LOVE the moon, mostly because of my spaceflight interest and occupation), and have only looked at the moon so far, along with learning my constellations.   Thanks!  (PS, whatever EP's I buy, I am willing to spend up to 80 a piece, on 3 total new ones (or 2, the 25mm seems ok) "
249,James Webb detection capabilities,"This question has (in a sense) been asked before, but not adequately answered, so let me put it a different way. How far away could James Webb be from Earth and still detect biosignatues in its atmosphere from radiation transfer during a transit? Also, what would be the easiest lines to detect (ozone IR lines?)? How would this compare with the scrapped TPF mission and how would it vary with stellar type of the host star? "
250,How did LIGO verify that the gravitational waves originated 1.3 billion years ago from two specific black hole collision?,"So they finally found gravitational waves.  That's cool and I trust is the case, but how did they confirm it originated 1.3 billion years ago and that two blackholes merging caused it and what distance it came from?   I am not sure if the extent of variation in the laser wavelength can tell us all this above information..   Any clues ? "
251,calculating paralax angle from observations,"Say I have 2 records, in horizontal coordinates of the azimuth ([tex]) and altitude ([tex]) of the moon at the same time in two different places that are [tex] degrees apart (taking the angle from the centre of the earth and assuming the earth is a perfect sphere). Is it possible to calculate the parallax angle of the moon between these two points with only the values above? if so how and if not what other values would I need? "
252,Why there are other planets in our solar system?,"Earth receives sunlight from Sun; in a similar way, do we receive any kind of energy from other planets?  My question is: We are dependent on sunlight, which is energy from Sun; similarly, are we dependent on other planets as well? What would happen if they weren't there? "
253,How do I measure occultation for the upcoming lunar eclipse?,"I'm trying to simulate the lunar eclipse on Jan. 31, similar to this simulation I made of last year's solar eclipse, using Three.js. I have the minute-by-minute coordinates for the Sun and the Moon in the J2000 frame -- where Earth is always at [0,0,0] -- and need to calculate the degree of occultation at each moment.  I'm treating the Sun as a point, since that's how 3D lighting works in Three.js, and came up with what I think is a clever solution to account for the penumbra: I calculated what size the Earth would have to be to create the penumbra from a point instead of a large spherical light source, like so:    (This obviously isn't to scale, but the inner circle would be the actual earth, the black lines are the penumbral rays from the Sun, and the blue lines originate from the center of the sun but reach the plane of the moon (the little gray guy) at exactly the same point.)  To test whether this actually works, I need to calculate the occultation of the moon and my imaginary Penumbral Earth (which is 8154.15km in radius), and compare those figures to Fred Espenak's calculations.  I found this StackOverflow post on how to calculate the angle between two vectors in 3D space. What I can't figure out his how to determine the apparent width of that angle and whether it is greater than the sum of the apparent radii of the Earth and Moon. I thought the Law of Cosines would be sufficient, but it accounts for the distance between the Earth and Moon as well. Here's a to-scale simulation showing the path of the moon over 24-hours on Jan. 31, with the Sun way off-screen:    One idea I had was to measure the vector from the sun to the outer edge of the fake earth, and the vector from the sun to the inner edge of the moon, but cannot figure out how to determine the points on the sphere where these vectors would be tangent. (I posed this question to Math StackExchange, but am hoping there's an easier way.)  While SPICE (via the Python wrapper spiceypy) was perfect for getting the locations of the bodies, it's occultation function doesn't allow for an arbitrary location of the observer, which eventually I will need to account for.  Is there an easy--or difficult--equation for occultation? Thanks! "
254,Are they really sure this isn't an Airy disk? How was that ruled out?,"How do they know that this is a spherical shell of gas, and not just something like an Airy pattern-like artifact produced by the VLT's large interferometric aperture?  Image from: [website]I get 180 pixels from center to the first minimum, and 72 pixels = 4 mas. That makes the first minimum at 10 mas or 4.8E-08 radians. The wavelengths are around 1.6 microns so that would correspond to a circular aperture of 40 meters using 1.22 λ/d.   Are they really sure this is a real shell, and not an Airy disk? How was that proven?  From [website]  “We were able to construct an amazing image, and reveal the onion-like structure of the atmosphere of a giant star at a late stage of its life for the first time,” says Antoine Mérand, member of the team. “Numerical models and indirect data have allowed us to imagine the appearance of the star before, but it is quite astounding that we can now see it, and in colour.”      Although it is only 15 by 15 pixel across, the reconstructed image shows an extreme close-up of a star 100 times larger than the Sun, a diameter corresponding roughly to the distance between the Earth and the Sun. This star is, in turn, surrounded by a sphere of molecular gas, which is about three times as large again.      T Leporis, in the constellation of Lepus (the Hare), is located 500 light-years away. It belongs to the family of Mira stars, well known to amateur astronomers. These are giant variable stars that have almost extinguished their nuclear fuel and are losing mass. They are nearing the end of their lives as stars, and will soon die, becoming white dwarfs. The Sun will become a Mira star in a few billion years, engulfing the Earth in the dust and gas expelled in its final throes.      Mira stars are among the biggest factories of molecules and dust in the Universe, and T Leporis is no exception. It pulsates with a period of 380 days and loses the equivalent of the Earth’s mass every year. Since the molecules and dust are formed in the layers of atmosphere surrounding the central star, astronomers would like to be able to see these layers. But this is no easy task, given that the stars themselves are so far away — despite their huge intrinsic size, their apparent radius on the sky can be just half a millionth that of the Sun.      “T Leporis looks so small from the Earth that only an interferometric facility, such as the VLTI at Paranal, can take an image of it. VLTI can resolve stars 15 times smaller than those resolved by the Hubble Space Telescope,” says Le Bouquin.      To create this image with the VLTI astronomers had to observe the star for several consecutive nights, using all the four movable 1.8-metre VLT Auxiliary Telescopes (ATs). The ATs were combined in different groups of three, and were also moved to different positions, creating more new interferometric configurations, so that astronomers could emulate a virtual telescope approximately 100 metres across and build up an image.      “Obtaining images like these was one of the main motivations for building the Very Large Telescope Interferometer. We have now truly entered the era of stellar imaging,” says Mérand.      A perfect illustration of this is another VLTI image showing the double star system Theta1 Orionis C in the Orion Nebula Trapezium. This image, which was the first ever constructed from VLTI data, separates clearly the two young, massive stars from this system. The observations themselves have a spatial resolution of about 2 milli-arcseconds. From these, and several other observations, the team of astronomers, led by Stefan Kraus and Gerd Weigelt from the Max-Planck Institute in Bonn, could derive the properties of the orbit of this binary system, including the total mass of the two stars (47 solar masses) and their distance from us (1350 light-years).

256,How do moons get captured?,"A moon-sized object is running loose in the Solar System, perhaps after a planetary collision.  As it approaches a planet, it's presumably following an approximately hyperbolic path.  If it goes on past, it's still on the same hyperbola, on a curve mirroring its approach (presumably).  How can the planet ever capture it, whatever the body's velocity?  Why doesn't it either collide or go on past? "
257,minimum size for a black hole to capture a photon,"If a photon is moving past a black-hole, what is the minimum size of the black-hole that will capture the photon and prevent the photon from going onto orbit around the mass? Do black-holes exist that have a stream of photons orbiting them?    "
258,How to derive uncertainty on photometric magnitudes of extended objects?,"Suppose I have an astronomical image in some bandpass and I do photometry of an extended source (i.e., a galaxy). I measure an enclosed magnitude within my aperture or galaxy profile. What is a straightforward recipe for obtaining a realistic uncertainty on that magnitude? Can I just do something like 1/(S/N) or is that only for point source photometry? "
259,Is Earth losing orbit?,Is the Earth losing or gaining distance from the sun overall? Could asteroids over time add weight to the Earth and push it farther from the sun more than having a degrading orbit around the sun? Does asteroids and space dust increase the mass the the outer planets over sustaining or pulling the Earth from the Sun? 
260,Why would all places appear to be at the center of the universe's expansion?,"I just watched an iMax planetarium video that claimed that no matter where you are in the universe, it will appear that you are at the center of the universe and all things are expanding away from you.   What the heck?? Can someone please explain this?  "
261,Is the flat curvature of the universe in the 5th dimension?,"It is hard to imagine that the universe could have a flat curvature while I've read that it is at this moment the most likely.  When you look around the universe is expanding in all directions, so it looks like a spherical ball shaped universe. Nevertheless the curvature is until now measured flat.   But how to understand that something that has in all directions galaxies look flat. So I thought perhaps they mean that is in the 5th dimension, in analogy with an ant who can't see that the line he is walking on is actually 3 dimensions.  But I read that If the true value of the cosmological curvature parameter is larger than [tex] we will be able to distinguish between the three models (spherical, hyperbolic and flat) even now. So I think how is something in the 5th dimension measured as it is beyond our capability of experiencing?  So somewhere I miss something but what? "

263,Frequency of gravitational wave detection,"You may have heard in the news that the LIGO experiment recently detected a gravitational wave.  Though I'm not an astronomer, the paper is a good read and mostly accessible. The detection of the gravitational wave is one thing, but the black hole merger is quite new to me. From the data I could collect in the paper and this site, the source is estimated at 1.3 billion years, and the chirp lasted only a few milliseconds.    My question: what is the frequency of events of this size order? Is there any estimate of the density of such events in the universe? "
264,Could there be massive charged “rivers” in interstellar space?,"Some suggest that there might be currents of charged particles moving at 0.98c in interstellar space.  Since this is tainted by association with the crack “Electric Universe” cosmology, my first impression is to be dismissive of the possibility.  But, proponents point to current observations and ideas, so I thought I’d check on this claim in and of itself.  Given what we do know, are such currents possible or excluded?  And, if possible, could they be massive enough to propell a space craft bearing a large sail? "
265,Greenhouse effect on planets,"Venus has a greenhouse affect because its atmosphere is 96 percent carbon dioxide. However, although mercury is closer to the sun it does not have the greenhouse effect because it has no atmosphere and only an exosphere. I was wondering why doesn't mars have a greenhouse effect like Venus? They both have around 95 percent carbon dioxide in their atmosphere and consist of an atmosphere. In addition, I was also wondering about what are the requirements to have a greenhouse effect on a planet? "
266,"What are the present, and potentially the future roles of data scientists in Astronomy?","I am a data scientist and curious about their roles in modern Astronomy, both now, and in the near future. What are type of roles and projects where data scientist are most active in Astronomy? What are the basic solutions provided by data scientists in astronomy. Are there data scientists as principle investigators, or are they at least team members in research efforts? "
267,How do elements with only one shell emit light?,"Electrons move to higher energy levels and drop back (electron migration). When they drop levels, photons are emitted and the wavelength/frequency emitted is based on how many levels are dropped. My question is, how does this work with elements with only one shell, such as hydrogen? Also, what determines how many energy levels are dropped? "
268,How fast can and do gravitational waves travel?,"I was thrilled by the recent announcement of the detection of gravitational waves. The media has done a great job explaining them and the theory behind them and I get the concept fairly well.  But if it's a warping of spacetime, not a particle phenomenon,  (or is it somehow?) How fast do these waves travel through space? Is it  constant or variable? Slower than the speed of light or even faster? If spacetime has no resistance per se, the what would keep them from traveling infinitely fast?  I'd love to understand it better and hope my question makes sense. "
269,How did we differentiate lights from stars?,I got this question while watching the COSMOS TV series. I couldn't find the right answer in google.    I read about Stellar classification and it states that we can classify the stars based on their spectral characteristics. My question is how can we be sure of which particular star the light is coming from. Since Earth is getting light from so many stars How the the light is classified?  Even if we can get different spectra then how can find their exact sources?   
270,Determination of High-Accuracy Distances of Terrestrial Planets from the Sun,"I understand how in olden days the Sun-Planet distances were estimated using:-  (i) measures of planet orbital periods ([tex]) from analysis of observations over several centuries;  (ii) Kepler's 3rd Law [tex] applied to the planet orbital periods to determine the relative lengths of the Sun-Planet semi-major axis distances ([tex]) expressed in terms of the AU (astronomical unit = distance from centre of Earth to centre of Sun);  (iii) particular Earth-Planet distances along Solar radials were measured using Parallax techniques such as that by Casinni for Mars and Transits of Venus;  (iv) From one or more Earth-Planet radial distances the length of the AU could then be determined by simple algebra.  (v) Other Sun-Planet distances could then be determined once the AU length was found.   Modern ephemerides e.g. those issued by JPL use various techniques:-     The orbits of the inner planets are known to subkilometer accuracy through fitting radio tracking measurements of spacecraft in orbit about them. Very long baseline interferometry measurements of spacecraft at Mars allow the orientation of the ephemeris to be tied to the International Celestial Reference Frame with an accuracy of 0′′.0002. This orientation is the limiting error source for the orbits of the terrestrial planets, and corresponds to orbit uncertainties of a few hundred meters.       The orbits of Jupiter and Saturn are determined to accuracies of tens of kilometers as a result of fitting spacecraft tracking data.       The orbits of Uranus, Neptune, and Pluto are determined primarily from astrometric observations, for which measurement uncertainties due to the Earth’s atmosphere, combined with star catalog uncertainties, limit position accuracies to several thousand kilometers.   from Folkner et al 2014.  I understand how spaceraft telemetry has been used to obtain highly accurate distances between Earth and the terrestrial planets.  But I am not clear about how highly-accurate distances can be determined between those planets and the centre of the Sun.   Question  Do such (Sun-planet-distance) determinations still basically rely on (the more accurate Newtonian version of) Kepler's 3rd Law relating planet orbital period and Sun-planet semi-major axis distance?    [tex]  What other methods or assumptions are used/involved?  EDIT - Afterthoughts  After further thought prompted by feedback from  u/atmosphericprisonescape my question boils down to  ""How are the positions (over time) of the Sun's Centre tied-in (with sub-kilometre accuracy) to the 4D space-time array of triangulated, high-accuracy, telemetry-derived, Terrestrial planet position determinations.   I guess that Kepler's 3rd Law is not invoked as such. Rather, high-accuracy (sub-kilometre) determinations of the position of the Solar centre presumably require (in addition to the high-accuracy planet positions) some specific deterministic ""motivation model""; i.e. a model of motion-determining factors.    These factors would include Newtonian Inertia, Newtonian Gravitational forces and Non-Newtonian factors leading to additional orbital angular velocity (cf Non-Newtonian Perihelion Precession and General Relativity as described at  wikipedia/Apsidal_precession ).    The ""motivation model"" would constrain the relative positions of the Sun and planets via their involment as motion generators, reactors and enactors.  "
271,Special Relativity as Applied to an Interstellar Starship?,"I'm once again confused by the twin paradox. Let's say I am on an interstellar starship flying at 0.6c from a star 30 light years away from Earth to a star 50 light years away from Earth and 40 light years from each other. How would you estimate the difference between the time on the ship when you reach the destination versus the time a person on Earth thinks it should be? Now let's say I travel back to the original star (In both circumstances, I accelerate at 1g until reaching 0.6c.) I would assume that I could use the twin paradox formula to determine the difference in elapsed time on the ship from that measured by a clock left at the first star.  Now, let's say I'm traveling in the same manner (1g acceleration until reaching 0.6c and 1g deceleration for the same duration until arrival) beginning at Earth, traveling to 16 stars and returning to Earth. I am thinking that the time difference between the ship clock (date) and Earth time would be based on the distance and acceleration/ deceleration segments of each leg of the journey independent of the components of the travel vectors in the direction (toward or away from the Earth). Am I right??  Would Earth send messages to the ship based on conventional measurements (ie Physics 101)? I would want to determine the difference between the time on Earth when the message is sent and the ship time when the message is received, considering of course the time of transit of the message (at light speed). "
272,Maximum spin rate of a black hole?,"I have just been watching a podcast called ""Deep Astronomy"" and the discussion was about a super fast spinning black hole discovered with the NuSTAR space observatory. This black hole was modeled with high confidence to be spinning at about 99% of the maximum spin rate. They stopped short of saying that the tangential velocity of this spin rate is ""c"" (and how can a singularity have a ""tangential velocity""?) They did say that the event horizon at maximum spin of a stellar black hole is about 1-1/2 km. and that if a black hole were to spin faster then the result would be a ""naked black hole"" that would defy the laws of physics (GR).   Also, shouldn't all black holes spin extremely fast (conservation of angular momentum) or would a retrograde accretion disk slow it down. Could somebody clarify this whole ""black hole spin thing"" without getting too complicated?? "
273,Planetary observations: what to expect from the Powerseeker 50AZ?,"I bought the Powerseeker 50AZ, which has D=50mm; F=600mm F/12 which comes with 3 eyepieces: 20mm, 12.5mm and 4mm.  As far as I can tell it's not possible to colimate this telescope. As suggested here this is a very important part to see sharp images.  I have tried to observe jupiter and mars with it and jupiter I could see a dim small blurry image and mars a very tiny dot with absolutely no way of seeing details on any of those in what seemed the best focus I could get from them. The only thing I can see details is the moon really. Also I have observed in what seemed very clear sky conditions.  So my question is: How much can I expect to see from planets with this telescope?  With this current setup should I be seeing jupiter and mars in more details?   UPDATE: Equipment link  [website]"

276,Does natural satellite(s) of a planet affects its orbital velocity around a star?,"Please excuse me for a lay question.   As we know, to calculate the orbital velocity, we take the mass of the orbiting body, the mass of the body being orbited and the distance between the two bodies into account.   However, we don't really care about the natural satellite(s) (of a planet) in the calculations. Why are they insignificant? Why isn't the whole system involved in the calculations? "

278,Why doesn't the equipartition theorem disallow spinning dust?,"This excellent answer to the question What is the physics of the “spinning dust” contribution to Cosmic Microwave Background measurements? Is well sourced. The abstract of one of the papers there, Purcell 1975 Interstellar grains as pinwheels begins with:     Contrary to the assumption usually made in theories of grain alignment, the rotational energy of an interstellar grain is likely to be very much greater than 3/s kT, where T is the gas temperature, or the grain temperature, or any other temperature in the system. Any more or less permanent irregularity of the grain’s surface with respect to accommodation coefficient, distribution of H-H recombination sites, or photoelectric emissivity will result in an unbalanced torque capable of spinning the grain up to high angular velocity. Such a grain is, in effect, the rotor of a heat engine.   In the body of the paper, the first example given is of a sort-of gedankenexperiment involving a hypothetical Crookes radiometer with the gas removed. The author explains that it would spin up to high energy (without saying how):     [...] The kinetic energy of the rotating paddle wheel is now enormously greater than it would be if it were immersed in, and en equilibrium with, a 6000 K radiation field, for then it would exhibit only a residual “Brownian rotation” appropriate to that temperature. So the wheel is really a heat engine, depending on the difference between the temperature of the vanes and that of the radiation field to which they are exposed.   Without the gas to cool them, I suppose that after the whole thing reaches equilibrium temperature the black sides radiate more strongly than the white sides and so there should always be a torque, and the final speed and kinetic energy would be limited only by friction and other practical losses.  This excellent answer to the question What is the difference between gas and dust in astronomy? points out that there is no real distinction between the two, but that they are limits in size, gas particles being small and dust particles being large(r).  So if dust can become pinwheels, then I have a hunch that very very large molecules can do this too, and if so, then so can smaller molecules. All you need is some mechanism for torque. Molecules can certainly have a non-uniform distribution of  H-H recombination probability just as dust can, and they can have some regions that are concave and some that aren't.  This makes me wonder if these gas molecules no longer obey the Equipartition theorem of thermodynamics. The spinning dust certainly doesn't.   Question: How can spinning dust and by induction, my hypothetical spinning molecules avoid conforming to the equipartition theorem? Why doesn't the equipartition theorem disallow spinning dust?     Source borrowed from here  Bonus points: Is that little arrow ([tex]) pointing the wrong way? "
279,"As a black hole passes through spacetime, does it affect it?","Nothing in the universe stands still. It's always on its way from somewhere to somewhere. A black hole follows a trajectory through the universe, moving from one locus in spacetime to another locus. Deep inside each black hole is a point that we've never been able to characterize.My question is, does the singularity, and possibly the powerful gravitational fields around the singularity have any measurable effect on the area of spacetime it passed through? One imagines an undeformed area of spacetime. After some time, a black hole passes through this spacetime, then moves on. Does the spacetime it passed through simply go back to being everyday, garden variety undeformed spacetime? "

283,Explain to a 4-year old why people below the equator are not tilted or suspended upside down,So I just bought a globe for my extremely inquisitive soon to be 4-year old son. He knows the very basics of the solar system and knows that we live on planet Earth and also knows the concept of gravity.  While i was explaining to him what the illuminated equator line is he asked me How do people stand below this line? (Look at the globe from a 4 year old's eyes and you will wonder the same)  I explained to him that earth is not as small of a sphere as this globe depicts and almost everywhere it will be relatively flat but then he said there are so many places on this globe at the bottom if you live there earth will be above you and gravity will hold you upside down.  How do I explain it to him?

The only reason I've seen from my research is ""because it's there"", but I'd like to know a more scientific reason. Evolutionists state the reason is ""because the Belt will give us more clues to the formation of the Solar System""; but I don't buy into that theory. Some dreamers say that asteroids may one day be mined for precious minerals; but this is only a far-off dream.  Theses three reasons given are all unsatisfactory; could a professional or knowledgeable amateur astronomer help me out here? "
288,Symmetry in Hawking radiation?,"I have a question concerning how Hawking radiation works.  As I understand, a pair of particle-antiparticle may pop to existence near the event horizon (from a virtual particle).  Then it might happen that the negative particle (antimatter) gets captured by the black hole whereas the positive particle (matter) escapes.  This results in a net loss of the black hole mass. If you repeat this process an astonishing number of times the Black Hole might end up completely evaporating.  Am I right so far? (Even if the explanation is not very mathematical)  My question then is:   This assumes that when a pair particle-antiparticle is created, a bias towards antiparticles being captured and particles escaping must exist.  Otherwise, the mass of the black hole might fluctuate, but in average for big numbers of pairs, equal percentage of particles and antiparticles would be captured/escape.  So, is there really a bias needed for the black hole to loose mass, or is it something wrong about my understanding of Hawking radiation?  Thanks "

How often would both moons be full at the same time, overlapping each other like a bullseye? How often would lunar eclipses occur for Moon A? How often would lunar eclipses occur for Moon b?

This can be done visually with ds9, but I have no idea of how I can access the fits file and determine the coordinates of the boundary of the image.   Any advice? I don't know much about the fits format, but it won't open with a usual text editor like gedit.  Edit: Now I have a more specific problem. I have four points in the sky defined by their declination and right ascension. Is there a simple way to check if these coordinates belong to the image coded in the fits file?

292,Sky photography through compositing images in software?,"I've read about and seen some rather sophisticated rigs for night sky photography that allow for ultra-long-exposure photos by counteracting the rotation of the sky by rotating the camera with it. The problem is mechanics for such rigs is rather complex, expensive and not entirely within reach of an amateur.  I was considering a different approach:    Set the camera on a firm tripod or whatever, leaving it motionlessly. Use intervalometer in the camera firmware to take multiple photos of moderately long exposure, short enough that the stars don't blur into lines. Save each as RAW so that the trace amounts of light captured in each of them don't get lost. Either using more bright stars as markers, or even calculating the misalignment of the photos basing on movement of the sky and lens geometry composite the images in software, to obtain good images of the night sky.   Obviously I wouldn't get very far with high zoom images, as the field of vision would shift away long before I'd get enough light in for a good photo, but obtaining a photo of a fair section of the sky from a relatively wide angle lens should be doable.   Is such approach used or even viable? Is there such software ""out there"" already or would I need to write my own from scratch?  "
293,Black hole without singularity?,"My question is about the equivalence about having an event horizon and having a singularity.  In one side the implication looks pretty obvious:    A singularity implies having an event horizon and therefore a black hole. Since the mass is compressed in a zero volume space, if you get close enough there will be a point where the escape velocity gets bigger than the speed of light so you will get a black hole by definition.   But what about the opposite? Does having an event horizon imply the existence of a singularity?  Could it be that you have a neutron star massive enough to reach a escape velocity equal to the speed of light but not strong enough to make the matter collapse?  Even if such star can not exist because the strong force collapses before reaching an event horizon, this doesn't mean an equivalence.   It just means that for some specific value of the maximum strong force this is not possible, but image now an imaginary exotic matter that has a way bigger strong force.  For such ""science fiction"" matter, it would be possible to reach an event horizon without collapsing to a singularity, right?  Or is it really an equivalence between this two concepts, such that no matter how resistant matter is to collapse it will never reach an event horizon? "

I didn't realize the collision of galaxies could result in black holes, but it got me wondering. If you lived in one of those galaxies, what would happen to you? Would your planet be destroyed in the blink of an eye at some point? If so, when?  Would the sky gradually fill with more and more stars? If your galaxy became a black hole, how would you experience that? All at once or very gradually? "
296,Is there a timeline for the naming of the TRAPPIST-1 worlds?,"For the moment, the TRAPPIST-1 worlds are just known by their official designations, like ""TRAPPIST-1a"" etc. NASA made a casual tweet asking people what they would name the worlds, and there has been some talk of naming the worlds after Belgian beers due to the origin of the ""Trappist"" name, but I haven't heard any official talk about what names might be given to the new exoplanets.  I'm wondering, is there a timeline (either official or traditional) for the naming of these worlds? Based on previous names given to astronomical bodies, are they likely to have names within the year, or is it likely to take at least five years or something, or is it completely unpredictable? "
297,Would a killer asteroid shattered into thousands of pieces produce the same devastation?,"If we blow up a global killer (in the 3 - 20km range) days before impact into enough pieces that none of the them exceeds, let's say, a 30m diameter and the impact pattern is dispersed over most of the athmosphere, would that be a possibility that the impact energy is soaked up with less catastrophic consequences than the hit of the asteroid in one piece? Or would the distributed energy heat up the athmosphere so much that it would kill higher life instantly or eventually over chemical/biological chain reactions? Or would the early impacts heat up or disturb the athmosphere so much that later (in the range of seconds or minutes) impacts would experience not enough friction so that there would be a surface bombardement with millions of little pieces?

299,Future of CMB observations: How will our knowledge of the early universe change?,"The Planck satellite has been presented and awaited for a long time as the ultimate experiments for measuring temperature fluctuations in the cosmic microwave background (CMB) over the full sky.   One of the big questions that still need answer and that Planck might help clarify is about the dynamics and driving mechanisms in the first phases of the universe, in particular in the period called inflation.  Thankfully there is room for improvements at small scales, i.e. small pieces of sky observed with extremely high resolution, and more importantly for experiments to measure the polarisation of CMB. I know that for the next years a number of polarisation experiments, mostly from ground and balloons, are planned (I'm not sure about satellites).  For sure some of these result will rule out some of the possible inflationary scenarios, but to which level?  Will we ever be able to say: ""inflation happened this way""? "

This provides fuel for vehicles and air for the crew to breathe. Can a similar plan work to settle the moon? Are there enough resources on the moon for a settlement to be self-sufficent? Is there enough water on the moon for this to be viable? "
302,Are the planets Trappist-1 in the solar system?,"I'm an Astronomy noob, but I'm interested in learning how stars and planets work. Everything started with the Trappist-1. I read about it, and it's fascinating. However, it's impossible for me to localize it with my current state of knowledge. Therefore, I would like to ask some general questions here.   First of all, during high school, I have learned that we are in the solar system and there are some planets orbiting the sun. Easy to remember and imagine, but there are stars, planets, constellations, etc. which I can't manage to relate to this basic system that I learned about.   And what confused me a lot are these two pictures:     and    And this definition of an exoplanet:     An exoplanet or extrasolar planet[...]   From the pictures, I can see that Trappist is in fact in the solar system. Is this right? And if this is right, why in the world did it take us so many years to find it? We have one Voyager that is almost out from the solar system. Couldn't it find it before? And is it possible to find more planets in our solar system? Is it because Voyager went only in the x-y direction, and not ""perpendicular"" to the orbits?  I'm sorry for asking these stupid questions, but I simply can't build new knowledge on my current low-level understanding of the solar system. This is my current knowledge:    Can you please help me to answer the above questions? "
303,Who gets to name Planet Nine if it is confirmed?,"According to Wikipedia, ""On 20 January 2016, researchers Konstantin Batygin and Michael E. Brown at Caltech announced calculation-based evidence of a massive ninth planet in the Solar System.""  If visual evidence or another researcher confirms the existence of Planet Nine, does the actual discovery warrant naming rights, or would this go to our Caltech friends?  I know from this question's answer, that:      ""Since the beginning of the 20th century the IAU is setting the standards for naming celestial bodies including planets. However, the IAU doesn't set the names, it only sets the standards.""   Does the 'discoverer,' or the 'confirmer' get to name (theoretical) Planet Nine? "
304,How could a hobbyist astronomer determine apparent magnitude of a star?,"Apparent magnitude is a rather complex way to determine the brightness of a star. Quoting the introduction text from the linked to Wikipedia page:     The apparent magnitude (m) of a celestial body is a measure of its   brightness as seen by an observer on Earth, adjusted to the value it   would have in the absence of the atmosphere. The brighter the object   appears, the lower the value of its magnitude. Generally the visible   spectrum (vmag) is used as a basis for the apparent magnitude, but   other regions of the spectrum, such as the near-infrared J-band, are   also used. In the visible spectrum Sirius is the brightest star in the   night sky, whereas in the near-infrared J-band, Betelgeuse is the   brightest.   While it is of course a useful measure also for the slightly more casual, non-scientific observer to help determine the observed star from its neighboring cluster, or identification in general, I always wondered if there is a way to measure apparent magnitude with enthusiast-class equipment, and what would these procedures be?  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apparent magnitude scale and observational limits (Source: ESA Science)  Also interesting would be a description of what level of precision and enthusiast can get with such equipment while measuring apparent magnitude of a distant star. If you need specifics to answer the question, such as precise available equipment or subject of observations, please feel free to choose at will any that would broadly match the capabilities of enthusiast-grade equipment. "
305,"Jupiter FM - What are practical and inexpensive ways for the amateur detection of signals from Jupiter, especially of the transit of her moons?",What modifications to a standard AM/FM or shortwave radio are needed in order to be able to detect radio-wave signals emitted from Jupiter?  Would it be possible to detect the transit of the major moons and even minor planets (maybe even Ceres and Mars) using this method? 
306,Can the moon appear to be in any position in the sky?,It seems to me that the Moon has appeared in many locations - apparent locations - in the 'dome of the sky'. I know that the Sun follows an arc from east to west and that the arc is smaller in winter than in summer. Therefore the Sun cannot appear in every location in the 'dome of the sky'. My question is: can the moon appear in any (every?) location in the 'dome of the sky'? 
307,What are practical considerations for backyard radio-astronomy detection of black holes?,"Evidently, direct observation of a black hole for an amateur astronomer, such as described for what professionals do in the question ""How are black holes found?"" would be nigh on impossible, so the observations would be based on their effects of the surrounding matter (specifically, accretion disks and jets) and more likely detecting the radiation signals.    Given that the locations of many black holes are known, what practical considerations would a backyard radio-astronomer need to consider to attempt to do detect black holes?  Amateur radio-astronomy detection of pulsars and gamma ray bursts are discussed practically in Introduction to Radio Astronomy (Society of Radio Astronomers), this question is to see what practical considerations would be needed to extend those techniques to detecting black holes. "
308,Could a close passing star be captured by the Sun's gravity?,Earlier I read an article here stating that a binary pair of stars passed within 0.8 light years from the sun. That made we wonder why the stars weren't captured by the Sun's gravity since the sun's gravitational influence spans over 1 light year.  Could a passing star be captured by the Sun's gravity? if so how close would it have to be before it was captured? 
309,How was water formed?,We know that a planet is formed from the nebula of gas and dust. Gravity pulls the particles together in a core. So we all know that the gas cloud is a cloud of hydrogen.    But how did water form? From where did oxygen come? How did it combine to make [tex]? 
310,Moon orbits crossing each other,"Some planets, such as Mars, have 2 or more moons. Giants, like Jupiter of Saturn have a lot of moons!  How likely the orbit of one crosses another one's orbit? Is it possible for two moons to collide? If yes, what would exactly happen? "
311,Shouldn't all moon orbits be inherently unstable?,"A hypothetical simulation starts with a planet called Earth in a perfectly circular orbit around a star called Sol. There is also a moon called Luna in a perfectly circular orbit around Earth.  Question: Can Luna's orbit remain perfectly circular or does it become elliptical over time? At what point does it become stable? Never?  Thinking: The distance between Sol and Luna is not constant, it fluctuates as Luna orbits Earth. Therefore the pull sunward also fluctuates. Shouldn't this cause all moon orbits to eventually deteriorate into longer and longer elliptical orbits until they collide with the planet they orbit? "
312,How can the orbit of a Kuiper Belt Object be differentiated from the transit of a rogue planet?,"Related to the question ""Are any Pluto-sized objects remaining to be discovered in the Kuiper Belt?"" and the fact that most of the Kuiper Belt objects have very elliptical orbits, the question begs, what observational techniques are used to confirm that the object being viewed is an orbiting Kuiper Belt Object, as opposed to the transit of a rogue or 'orphan' planet? "
313,Why are solar systems heliocentric,"So this may be an incorrect assumption, but from my knowledge solar systems are heliocentric and there are always suns. (I realize to be a solar system there must be a sun semantically.) But it seems to me that planets and stars are just bodies of mass, so are there cases of solar systems where the star is just one of the bodies of the system and orbits around a super massive planet? And similarly are there 'solar systems' without stars, where there are a group of planets orbiting a massive planet at the center of the system? "
314,Is gravitational energy released when a body contracts?,"Kelvin stated that gravitational energy released due to contraction was responsible for the energy radiated in the stars. Although the theory was wrong, was the assumption practically right? If it's right, how does contraction take place? "
315,"How to view Jupiter with 4.5"" Newtonian Reflector","I have a 4.5"" Newtonian Reflector and I took a look at Jupiter the other night.  I was able to get a reasonably sharp view of it and see a number of it's moons, but I was unable to see any surface details, it was pretty much just white glare.  I'm not sure if it's possible to distinguish any surface details with the telescope I have, so any advice on best setup would be useful.  I have a few accessories:   x2 barlow lense 10mm eye piece 25mm eye piece 6mm eye piece moon filter color filters   Would anything else, other than a more powerful telescope, help me?  I was unsure if I might have an alignment issue that was causing this, but as I could make out the moons as sharp dots on the planetary plane, I assumed not.  Any advice would be welcomed. "
316,Which galaxy is receding from the Milky Way the fastest? What is known of the mechanism behind its recession?,"Galaxies are always in motion relative to the Milky Way. My question is, which galaxy is receding the fastest from our viewpoint?  What is the theorised mechanism that causes this? "
317,"When we see the Sun, do we actually see its past?",The Sun's rays hit our eyes around 8 minutes after they are emitted from the Sun. Does this mean that the Sun that we see is always the Sun as it was some 8 minutes before? I strongly think this must be happening; is it really a fact? Do we always see the Sun's past? 
318,"If the moon wasn't receding from Earth, what would be the impact on the weather and tides?","Moon is slowly receding from Earth, which means that after its formation it was much closer to the Earth than now. How would weather look like if it wasn't receding at it would be now as close as at the beginning?  Surely, the tides would be much higher, but how big would be the difference? I've also watched document stating that the hurricanes would be much stronger. Was there any simulations, how much stronger they would be? "
319,Orbiting around a black hole,Is it possible (for either a satellite or a planet) to orbit around a black hole? Do they attract everything around themselves into the center? Or they just affect gravitational force just like stars? 
320,Why Did Mars lose its Magnetic Field?,"I had heard that Mars once had a planetary magnetic field, but that it is now gone? What happened to it? "
321,Can Magnetars destroy planets?,"Magnetars are the most magnetic things in our universe. Because of how powerful their magnetic fields are, they could split every single atom apart from each other in our body.  Because of this could they destroy planets (rocky or not)? If so, how close would the planet have to be? "
322,When will a day on Earth & Mars be the same length?,"I read on Wikipedia that:     As on Earth, the period of rotation of Mars (the length of its day) is slowing down. However, this effect is three orders of magnitude smaller than on Earth because the gravitational effect of Phobos is negligible and the effect is mainly due to the Sun.[19] On Earth, the gravitational influence of the Moon has a much greater effect. Eventually, in the far future, the length of a day on Earth will equal and then exceed the length of a day on Mars.   So, how far into the future exactly will it be when the length of a day on Earth and Mars will be equal? Also, for how long will their day lengths be within say, one second of each other?  By ""day"", I mean the Mean Solar Day. "
323,Earth and ferromagnetism,"Earth's core is a giant liquid iron ball actually. If I know well, the magnetic field of our planet (that protects the surface from some particles comes from the Sun) can exist because as Earth rotates, the liquid iron core also rotates, and it generates a magnetic field.  However, ferromagnetism has strict conditions. How can the liquid and hot core still be ferromagnetic? How is it possible for Earth to have a magnetic field generated by a body that is not even solid? "
324,What is the origin of the OBAFGKM classification system?,"Once a body has been identified as a star it is classified into a subsection of either O,B,A,F,G,K or M (I think there are also 3 more letters recently added)  What is the origin of this classification system? Do each of the letters stand for anything?    "
325,3000th Question: What does the future of astronomy look like with the next generation of telescopes?,"What will the benefits and advantages be of the upcoming generation of telescopes such as LSST, E-ELT and JWST? And more broadly where will this leave astronomy in 10-20 years time?  This isn't a direct duplicate of (What are the next planned space telescopes?) because I want to know what the aims and benefits of such telescopes are, and what new ones might have been planned since. "
326,How can we tell that a short-period binary is tidally locked?,"Observationally, how can this be established?   What is known theoretically about the process?  Are there any reference papers to read? "
327,How dense would planet earth have to be to have the same gravity as Jupiter?,"I was reading this question about how small could a planet be while having earth-like gravitational pull.   This got me thinking, how dense would planet Earth have to be to have the same gravitational pull as Jupiter while all the other factors staying the same (even if it is impossible in the real world)?  If there are any formulas could you please explain them so I understand them please?  Edit  Sorry about some of the confusion but I meant keeping everything but the mass the same. "
328,Does the Moon have any oxygen in its atmosphere?,"Since the moon has gravity, it's almost impossible that there aren't some gasses trapped on the surface by the moon's gravity. Has any free-floating oxygen been found on the Moon? If so, in what concentration? "
329,Why are a few things in our universe named after chocolate?,"Like the title says, why are a few things in our universe named after chocolate?  For example, there are the Milky Way, galaxy and Mars.   Is there a reason for this or not? Or is it that the chocolates were named after them? "
330,Why does squinting make hard-to-see objects clearer?,"So I, like most other astronomy enthusiasts, have, at some point, not been able to see something clearly, such as a star, and have had to squint to be able to see it better. When this happens, the object seems to become clearer, but the light seems to gain a cross, or sometimes a hexagon, or an irregular line shape when doing so. I've noticed a similar effect on different models of telescopes, especially the newtonian reflector series. More on this here: ([website]"
331,Internal heat and planetary differentiation,"I was reading an article on planetary differentiation, and apparently internal heat production plays a major role. There are several sources of such heat described, such as tidal heat, radiogenic heat, etc. What I did not understand however is how, on chemical level, does warming up a system ""heterogenize"" it. Logically, wouldn't an addition of kinetic energy mean that molecules bump around more violently, therefore becoming more mixed up?  Or does this 'internal heat' story mean that the heat is actually escaping the planet, therefore kinetic energy is lost, therefore the planet is actually cooling down?  source: [website]"
332,Does Light Year is their past?,"I just wanted to know if what we can only see out-side of our planet is just the past of other objects?  If 1 Light Year is equals to 365.25 Days, then I saw an object outside our planet that is 1 Light Year away from us, does it means I just saw its past 365.25 days ago? "
333,How are binary star systems created?,"I don't know how common it is for a system to have two stars (or perhaps even more) but how do they arise? Is that due to the stellar accretion disc, or the composition of the stellar nebula?  Or are most of them created by a collision of stars? "
334,What theories are there in explaining the formation of the Pluto-Charon system?,"After reading the question and answer to Effect of Charon on Pluto, a further question is this: how is the Pluto-Charon relationship explained?  Specifically, what theories are there in how did the Pluto-Charon system was formed?  Additionally, does this explain the presence of other moons (Nix, Hydra etc)? "
335,Does the Sun turn around a big star?,"The Moon orbits the Earth. The Earth orbits the Sun.  Does the Sun orbit another bigger star? If so, does this star orbit, in turn, a very big star? ... etc ...     What are all the intermediate subsystems up to motion around the center of the Milky Way?   "
336,Relationship between temperature of nebula and size of star,"I was wondering, in the process of star formation, does the temperature of the nebula that produces a star play a role in the size of that star? I mean, it's only logical that the size would depend on the amount of matter around.But then, if the temperature is lower, that means that the net density is lower, so the star would 'absorb' less matter. Or is that not a factor, and the growing star would gobble up anything on its vicinity? I've encountered some contradicting sources and I'm trying to double check. "
337,Why is dark energy density given in grams per cm$^3?$,"According to Wikipedia article,     The density of dark energy ([tex]) is very low, much less than the density of ordinary matter or dark matter within galaxies. However, it comes to dominate the mass–energy of the universe because it is uniform across space.   Other sources I found also give the density either as percentage of mass of the universe, or just as mass density like above, [tex] or similar.  In about all other applications and contexts of usage of energy density, I'd find MJ/L, or other units of energy per volume. Why is energy of density given as mass per volume, and how do I convert it to more familiar units? Using [tex] ? "
338,Why is there free magnesium in the ecliptic (if there is) and why would some be orbiting within the ecliptic plane but retrograde?,"This answer to the question What direct or indirect observations of dust can one make by eye or with binoculars? mentions Brian May's thesis and it's connection to Zodical Light:     Brian May (CBE):           In 2007, Brian May, lead guitarist with the band Queen, completed his thesis, A Survey of Radial Velocities in the Zodiacal Dust Cloud, thirty-six years after abandoning it to pursue a career in music. He was able to submit it only because of the minimal amount of research on the topic undertaken during the intervening years. May describes the subject as being one that became ""trendy"" again in the 2000s.         Brian May's Thesis: A survey of radial velocities in the zodiacal dust cloud      And for good measure, Brian May's announcement of IAU's naming of the asteroid 17473 Freddiemercury YouTube: [website]I believe that MgI stands for neutral, atomic magnesium, and since this is optical (not X-rays) this would have to be free atoms, or perhaps molecular, but not bound magnesium in compounds or metals.  Question: Why is there free magnesium in the ecliptic (if there is) and why would some be orbiting within the ecliptic plane but retrograde?  The abstract in full:     This thesis documents the building of a pressure-scanned Fabry-Perot Spectrometer,    equipped with a photomultiplier and pulse-counting electronics, and its deployment at the Observatorio del Teide at Izaña in Tenerife, at an altitude of 7,700 feet (2567 m), for the purpose of recording high-resolution spectra of the Zodiacal Light. The aim was to achieve the first systematic mapping of the MgI absorption line in the Night Sky, as a function of position in heliocentric coordinates, covering especially the plane of the ecliptic, for a wide variety of elongations from the Sun. More than 250 scans of both morning and evening Zodiacal Light were obtained, in two observing periods – September-October 1971, and April 1972. The scans, as expected, showed profiles modified by components variously Doppler-shifted with respect to the unshifted shape seen in daylight. Unexpectedly, MgI emission was also discovered. These observations covered for the first time a span of elongations from 25º East, through 180º (the Gegenschein), to 27º West, and recorded average shifts of up to six tenths of an angstrom, corresponding to a maximum radial velocity relative to the Earth of about 40 km/s. The set of spectra obtained is in this thesis compared with predictions made from a number of different models of a dust cloud, assuming various distributions of dust    density as a function of position and particle size, and differing assumptions about their speed and direction. The observations fit predominantly prograde models fairly well, but show a morning-evening asymmetry, different in the two observing periods. Models are investigated containing various components, including prograde and retrograde orbiting dust around the Sun, a drift of interstellar material though the Solar System, and light from distant emitting matter. The implications for possible asymmetries of the Zodiacal Cloud are discussed. Other researches on the Zodiacal Dust Cloud, before, during, and after my observations, are reviewed, including recent insights into its structure, orientation, and evolution, up to the present day, and my observations are evaluated in this context.

339,What are the cloud-like blobs in the Martian southern hemisphere?,"In a very recent edition of New Scientist, an article Mystery cloud-like blobs over Mars baffle astronomers (16 Feb, 2015), detailed that     on 12 March 2012, amateur astronomers around the world noticed a strange blob rising out of the planet's southern hemisphere, soaring to 250 kilometres above the surface.   According to the article, this anomaly grew to be about 1000km across and even had 'fingers' stretching to space.  The article, details several theories (some being a bit wild) including atmospheric processes, aurora and stretching reality quite a bit - aliens (from the article, not me).  An image of the plume is shown below (a still image from this YouTube clip, which states that a 2nd plume was observed some months later:    The plumes appear to have formed in a region called Terra Cimmeria.  What are scientific theories, models etc for the formation of the cloud-like blobs in the Martian southern hemisphere?  "
340,What observations will be done during the New Horizons flyby of Ultima Thule?,"On New Year's Eve 2018, the New Horizons spacecraft will fly past Ultima Thule (2014 MU69) at about a third of the distance it flew by Pluto some years ago. So it should be able to get some detailed photographs, but the closing speed is rather high. What scientific observations will be done during the flyby?   Is it a case of a couple of snaps, assuming the camera is pointed correctly? Or is there more that can be done? Any other instruments that will get useful data? "
341,What are the characteristics of solid carbon dioxide on the Martian poles?,When carbon dioxide forms on Mars is it like ice or snow? How dense is newly formed solid carbon dioxide? Would more carbon dioxide form inside a pit vs a flat plain?  How thick or deep does solid carbon dioxide accumulate on Mars?  [website]
342,How long would it take for a rogue planet to evaporate in the late stages of the Universe?,"I've read once a popular science book, in which the author calculated how long would it take for the most massive black holes to evaporate because of Hawking radiation. He claimed that after that time the Universe will be the soup filled only with elementary particles.  However, what would happen with celestial bodies that aren't black holes? For example, a rogue planet of the size of Earth, drifting somewhere in deep space, in an extremely cold Universe? What known effects would cause that planet to evaporate? How long would it take? "
343,Enhanced Star-Gazing with Special Glasses,"I watched a video yesterday on how telescopes not only magnify images but also increase the amount of light entering into your eye, allowing you to see things not normally visible with naked eye. Would it be possible to create a ""telescope"" with no magnification, a wide field of view... say ~190 degrees left/right, ~120 degrees up/down (the average human field of view), and small enough to wear? Essentially creating glasses that allow for better star gazing?   A side question is do night vision goggles let you see more stars? or does the increase in ambient light from earthly objects negate any increase.  "
344,What resolution is needed to see a quasar through the galactic center?,"The center of the galaxy is densely packed with stars and obscured by a whole lot of dust between us and it. For those reasons, groups that study the motion of stars around the super-massive black-hole in the center of the Milky way need to use big telescopes at near infrared wavelengths. Questions of dust obscuration aside, what resolution would a telescope need to have to pick out a background quasar looking through the center of the Milky Way?  SDSS QSOs start at around 8th magnitude (Vega) in 2MASS photometry ([tex] and [tex] bands), and rise like a power law as flux goes down Here's a quick and dirty plot of SDSS QSO survey made from SDSS data release 10 made using topcat. I would convert the graph to counts per solid angle, but I'm too lazy to look up the survey area of the SDSS spectroscopic survey right now.    There's a quick and dirty example of the effect I'm describing in Figure 2 of the Ghez et al. (2008) paper Rob Jeffries linked to below. The difference between the red points and blue points is both exposure time (more photons) and higher Strehl ratios (a measure of how close to diffraction limited the image is and, hence, a proxy for resolution given the same optical system).  Generically, you could say that the question is: how do we determine the confusion limit in images with point sources? This is just specifically applied to the field of view on the sky with the highest density of resolvable point sources available. Concretely, say we wanted to resolve [tex] magnitude sources in views of the galactic center, what resolution is required to do so?  Getting to the full answer to the more concrete question ""how deep would we have to look to see a background quasar"" would require additional information: size of field of view, and dust extinction along the sight line. So, for simplicity, I'm assuming that if you're resolving [tex] magnitude sources in [tex] band, you're probably seeing a quasar. Thus we only need the projected density on the sky of sources brighter than that cutoff, roughly, and some description of how resolved sources need to be from the background brightness to detect them to answer the question. "
345,How do stars affect the orbits of moons?,"I asked a question previous similar to this, but I'm wondering, can a star make a moon move closer to its planet or further away? How? "
346,Is the SOI a spherical region or a oblate-spheroid-shaped region?,"The Wikipedia article on Sphere of influence states that:     ""A sphere of influence (SOI) in astrodynamics and astronomy is the   oblate-spheroid-shaped region around a celestial body where the   primary gravitational influence on an orbiting object is that body.""   (Emphasis added.)   It then gives an expression for the radius of the sphere of influence.   Is the SOI a spherical region or a oblate-spheroid-shaped region?  If it is an oblate-spheroid-shaped region, then why? "
347,How often does Earth cross the galaxy regions with higher supernovae activity?,"According to Summa Technologiae, a book by a Polish author Stanisław Lem that based his science fiction novels on scientific research of the era, the Earth crossed in the moment of forming of life the arms of the Galaxy, with high supernovae activity, which triggered life creation. Afterwards, it moved to regions with low supernovae activity, which enabled the preservation of existing life.  I'd like to test the validity of this claim against current research. How often does the Earth cross regions with higher concentrations of stars (and therefore, much greater chance of gamma burst wipe)? Additionally, how many times the probability of nearby supernova explosion is higher in that regions? "
348,How large can a ball of water be without fusion starting?,"How large can a ball of water be without fusion starting?  Peculiar question: some explanation might be necessary. My young son is into ‘space’ and astronomy. One of his posters says that Saturn could float, if a sufficiently large ocean could be found. Obviously that wouldn’t work: Saturn’s atmosphere would peel off and join or become the atmosphere of the larger body, and then Saturn’s dense core would sink.    But could such an ocean even exist without fusion starting? "
349,Temperature of the Sun's rays,What is the temperature of the light that leaves the Sun towards the Earth and does it cool down during it's journey here ? If it doesn't cool down then how come it isn't frying the Earth ? Is it our atmosphere that is preventing it from doing so or does it cool down during it's trip here in space ? 
350,How to convert Log(g) vs T_eff to y vs (v-y)?,"I have a plot in Log(g) vs T_eff coordinates from my stellar evolution model. The parameters of the model are M=0.8 M_solar, [Fe/H]=-1.19, Y=0.245. I want to convert it to the y vs (v-y) coordinates (Strömgren photometric system) in order to compare my model with observations of NGC 6752 globular cluster. How do I make this conversion?  This paper provides a table that includes the following columns: Log(g), T_eff, V, (B-V), (b-y), m1, c1.  I think I could use this if I can figure out how to calculate y and (v-y) from these data. Is it possible? "
351,"Advice on first Telescope (refractor vs reflector), Barlow lens","I am planning on buying my first telescope. I am getting an 80mm refractor and a 114mm reflector for the same price range. Which would be a better option? Further, would a Barlow lens solve the chromatic aberration issues with a f/5 refractor? "
352,Did the Late Heavy Bombardment Period Happen Because of a Stellar System Collision?,"I was thinking about the impending collision between M31 and the milky way galaxy, and I've heard that since a galaxy is mostly space most of the contents of both galaxies would be just fine. Could a similar effect be responsible for the late heavy bombardment era? Just instead of galaxies, stellar systems? "
353,Is it unlikely for a meteor to hit the day side of the earth?,"I have binge watched a lot of documentaries and movies about meteors hitting the earth. The one pattern I have seen, even in the science-fact documentaries like Nova, is that the animations show meteors hitting the earth on the day side. By that, I mean at a near 90° angle in the center of the day zone. As if it were to hit the earth at high noon.   What seems unlikely to me is where the meteor hits. It seems intuitive to me that statistics would favor a meteor strike on the night side of the planet rather than the day side. Or, possibly from the transition between day and night if the meteor came in from the side.  Is my suspicion correct? Is it unlikely for a meteor to hit the earth on the day side and far more likely to hit the night side?  To clarify, I'm thinking of significant meteor strike, like the Chicxulub impact  that killed off the dinosaurs. If something that massive came in from the day side, wouldn't it more likely to have been captured or redirected by the sun because of the sun's gravity? "
354,snapshot of solar system,"I am working on a little project where I want to simulate the solar system to teach myself working with python and OOP.  I want to calculate the orbits ""real"", from tangential velocities and gravitational accelerations. For this, in order to not only get circular orbits, but the real, eccentric orbits, I need kind of a snapshot of the solar system with positions and tangential velocities at those positions of the planets (and their moons, but I highly doubt that exists).   EDIT: I think something like the velocities at the Apoapsis should be enough to derive a reasonably right orbit from it, right?  I don't even know if something like that exists, or where to get it from. Does anybody happen to know something of this? "
355,Distance from the sun can equal a hospitable planet?,It is said that planets are continuously moving away from the sun.

356,"From original burst, fraction of stellar mass still surviving on Main sequence","Suppose that all stars in this galaxy were born in a single major-merger burst event about 10 Gyr ago. From this original burst, I want to compute the fraction of stellar mass still surviving as stars in the main sequence ? For this, I have got to use a Salpeter IMF, and a star formation range between 0.1 and 120 solar masses.  What I have done is starting from Salpeter IMF : [tex]  with [tex] a constant normalization.  From this, I integrate from [tex] to [tex]  [tex]  This result depends on the valeur of [tex] and I don't know how to deal with it in order to get [tex] ?  Moreover, it seems that I have to take into account of the age of the major-merger burst event (10 Gyr).  From these 2 principles, how could I calculate the fraction of stars surviving in the main sequence ?  Any help is wlecome, Regards "
357,Why does the Earth have a tilt of ~23°?," Is there a reason that the Earth has the tilt that it does (~23°)?   How do we know which way is supposed to be 0°?

358,"What experiment does this ""Tracing the History of Starlight"" video try to explain?","The YouTube video Tracing the History of Starlight with NASA's Fermi Mission describes observation by the Fermi gamma ray telescope  of EBL (extragalactic background light) gamma rays from 2,000 Blazars. It seems to suggest that they used an attenuation measurement of the gamma rays to determine... I'm not exactly sure exactly what was determined by the investigation discussed in the video.   The attenuation is due to reverse pair-production, two photons in, and an electron-positron pair out. I am not sure if they measured 511 keV gamma rays from subsequent annihilation of the positrons, or attenuation of the primary gammas, and I am also not sure if the experiment was used to measure the primary gamma ray rates, or the total density of UV-Vis-IR light photons with which the gamma rays annihilated.  Question: Is there a simple but physically clear way to explain all of this; the experiment the video is supposed to be explaining?  How do they differentiate attenuation due to revere pair production from attenuation by say Compton scattering considering dust and gas?   "
359,Is our universe flat?,"I heard our universe is flat. Then one question is puzzling in my mind. If our universe is really flat, why we measure distance from any point across in a spherical way. In other words, why we say, the comoving distance (radius) is now about 46.6 billion light years. If this radius is only treated for observable universe, then how does science find that the universe is flat knowing nothing beyond the limit of the universe.  There are some questions in SO, however, they do not assimilate what I intended to know. In this question, for instance, OP asked about whats the shape of the universe. And also there are some terms related to black holes, 3D shape, ball etc. Apart from those complexity, my intention is simply to be clarified, why we call our universe flat? And by word flat, what I meant ""having a level surface; without raised areas or indentations"". Am i missing any alrernative meaning of flat here? "
360,How do they measure sub-centimeter wave height on a moon of Saturn?,"Michael Stevens from V-Sauce has a video called The Mandelbrot Set on a different channel. At 12:56 he says:     There’s a moon of Saturn that has liquid hydrocarbon lakes that literally have waves that are only like a fraction of a centimeter large, but, you could surf that, right?   While Michael occasionally does indeed say things that appear to be wrong I'm guessing he got this correct.  How are waves a fraction of a centimeter tall measured on a moon of Saturn? How is the existence of these waves either measured or deduced? "
361,How many planets are there in this solar system?,"So, in school (that's a long time age) they have been teaching us there are 9 planets in our solar system.   Mercury Venus Earth Mars Jupiter Saturn Uranus Neptune Pluto   But every now and then I keep reading stories about another ""dwarf planet"" (Eris, discovered in 2005) that - depending on what source tells the story - is another planet according to the astronomical definition, while other sources say that it isn't a planet. Some even say Pluto isn't a planet anymore either.   The result: I'm confused due to the contradicting stories. Even Wikipedia isn't clear about Eris and only writes (emphasis mine):     NASA initially described it as the Solar System's tenth planet.    Initially? So, is it a 10th planet or not? Fact is, there is another ""something"" out there and it surely seems to look like a planet. Yet, some people keep stating there are 9 planets in our solar system, while others say there are more than 9 planets, and then again there are people stating that the latest definition of ""planet"" has kicked out Pluto too so there are actually fewer than 9 planets in our solar system.  Trying to get a definite, official, and astronomically correct answer I can actually rely on, I'm therefore asking: How many planets are there in this solar system?  EDIT  The ""Definition of planet"" at Wikipedia doesn't really help either, as it states:     Many astronomers, claiming that the definition of planet was of little scientific importance, preferred to recognize Pluto's historical identity as a planet by ""grandfathering"" it into the planet list.*      * Dr. Bonnie Buratti (2005), ""Topic — First Mission to Pluto and the Kuiper Belt; ""From Darkness to Light: The Exploration of the Planet Pluto"""", Jet Propulsion Laboratory.

Ideally, an astronomical trusted source and/or paper. "
362,A moving star at 6pm (Indonesia Time),"After I back from Minimart, it's about 6pm though, I saw the sky, yeah a beauty evening sky, but I sense a something weird from the sky, It look like a star at first it moving in low speed, I Though that was a Kite or plane, but it cant be plane cuz it moved up then turned right then turned left and get back. it size and it light same as a normal Stars. It's move like as Kite, but it so bright like star. after a few minutes, it's stoped move, but then its Moved Fastest Like A shooting stars, and yes it has a tail like Comet,that moved in Light speed.  after that I got back to home, I asked to my friend on FB, I said that I saw a moving star, I didnt say it when, but my friend asked me back, ""was that do along 6pm?"" ""whoa, how can be You know that?"" and then my friend said if that was an UFO he ever saw that many times.  (sorry for bad English) "
363,Measuring the size and the geometry of Universe,"When we would be able to tell with surety that universe is finite or infinite? How can we exactly determine the density of the universe so, that we compare it with critical density, in order to determine its geometry?

364,Can a black hole turn back into a star?,"I understand that a black hole happens after a star exhaustions elements capable of undergoing fusion.  Without the energy produced by fusion the remaining mass of the star collapses on itself and forms a black hole.  I conclude black holes must be deficient in hydrogen, helium and elements that undergo fusion in stars.  I understand that hydrogen and the like undergoes fusion in stars in part (or completely?) because of the gravitational pressure which occurs in stars.  Suppose a young star replete with hydrogen merged with a black hole.  My question: would the result be a larger black hole, or a radiant star with a very massive heart?  Could a massive infusion of (fusible?) elements reboot the black hole back into a star? "
365,What is the specific heat capacity of interstellar clouds?,"Star forming molecular clouds and especially Bok globules are low temperature [tex] K environments with density on the order of [tex] kg/m[tex], mostly hydroogen with about 1% dust. What is their heat capacity?  I have tried to find good data for low-temperature heat capacities for hydrogen (which would be nice to have anyway), but most experiments also use dense hydrogen rather than the by Earth standard very low-pressure molecular gas of the clouds. Are there any decent estimates of how much a given increase in energy increases the cloud temperature? Or should one just use the ideal gas approximation for a diatomic gas and assume [tex] per mole?

366,"Can my Sky Watcher Infinity 76P ""make the sky bright"" & do I want it to?","I've seen quite a few time-laps films where the Milky Way is seen as bright and filling the sky, as some fantastic glowing cloud full of glittering stars.  I wonder if it is possible to see this (or something a little similar) through a telescope using my eyes (not a camera)?   It seems to me that you would want as little magnification as possible to see the sky like this, and it would be all about gathering as much light as possible? This answer describes this scenario as ""Low Brightness"" (and low resolution) objects.  I have a Sky Watcher Infinity 76P telescope. At the moment, it has a 30x erecting lens that tends to wobble in its helical mount, and doesn't give a good image. I've read claims that with a non erecting lens and a bit of care, this telescope can give good images.   Are non magnifying lenses available for the Sky Watcher? Or would I be better off taking a different approach completely, such as buying binoculars? I'd like to be able to share this with my children, and they find the existing Sky Watcher lens hard to use – as well as its wobble, I think this is because it has a narrow ""exit pupil"" (?), so that you need to get your eye in just the right place. Can I get a low magnification lens that is more forgiving for the user? Can I expect to be able to see something from my backyard in a small UK town? Some of the shots in that film I link to seem to show clear bright sky pictures when there are other sources of light on the ground, or even the setting sun.   Many thanks. "
367,"Why is our solar system ""tipped"" about 63° with respect to the plane of our galaxy?","Our own solar system is ""tipped"" by about 63 degrees with respect to the plane of the galaxy. Has it ever been researched or is there any scientific theory which could explain the reason why our solar system and solar systems in general are not ""in-line"" to the galaxy's plane? What exactly determines the orientation of solar systems? "
368,Why don't astronomers use meters to measure astronomical distances?,"In astronomy distances are generally expressed in non-metric units like: light-years, astronomical units (AU), parsecs, etc. Why don't they use meters (or multiples thereof) to measure distances, as these are the SI unit for distance? Since the meter is already used in particle physics to measure the size of atoms, why couldn't it be used in astrophysics to measure the large distances in the Universe?   For example:   The ISS orbits about 400 km above Earth. The diameter of the Sun is 1.39 Gm (gigameters). The distance to the Andromeda Galaxy is 23 Zm (zettameters). At its furthest point, Pluto is 5.83 Tm (terameters) from the Sun.   Edit: some have answered that meters are too small and therefore not intuitive for measuring large distances, however there are plenty of situations where this is not a problem, for example:   Bytes are used for measuring gigantic amounts of data, for example terabytes (1e+12) or petabytes (1e+15) The energy released by large explosions is usually expressed in megatons, which is based on grams (1e+12) The SI unit Hertz is often expressed in gigahertz (1e+9) or terahertz (1e+12) for measuring network frequencies or processor clock speeds.   If the main reason for not using meters is historical, is it reasonable to expect that SI-unites will become the standard in astronomy, like most of the world switched from native to SI-units for everyday measurements?  "
369,Can eternal inflation and gravity explain dark energy?,"First of all, I have absolutely no background in astronomy and physics. I just watch a lot of ""i-hope-scientific"" youtube channels talking about physics and astrophysics and I can kind of follow the maths and concepts.  So, I was thinking, with absolutely no physics to support this:  REAL QUESTION STARTS HERE:  Say, the big bang happened everywhere, followed by inflation that never stopped. This is wat eternal inflation described (if i am correct)  Then, as eternal inflation goes on and more and more universe outside of the observable universe is created. Then there would be an unlimited amount of mass outside our observable universe.   Can this mass create an gravitational effect on the galaxies in our universe?  We are at the center of our observable universe, so the gravitational effect of all the mass outside our observable universe would never affects us. But from the perspective of another galaxy, it would be affected by a bit of universe that is outside our observable universe.   Then you might explain the effect that galaxies that are farther away from us move faster away from us. And that galaxies closer to use move slower away. Then you can explain this by saying that the galaxies farther away are closer to the ""unlimited"" mass outside our observable universe. And thus are more affected by this. And that galaxies close by are less affected.  The theory with dark energy claims that dark energy causes an outward push from the inside of our universe. Wouldn't this be indistinguishable from a gravitational pull from the outside?  Also, could this explain the red-shift we see in light from the far end of the observable universe? If I remember correct, gravity can red-shift light if the light moves away from the source of the gravitational pull (as seen near black holes). Light form the far end of the universe has moved trough the gravitational pull away from the ""infinite mass"" of the outside universe.  This was my idea, and I would like to see where I am thinking wrong.  One thing where I obviously might be thinking wrong is that this effect would be homogeneous throughout the universe and it should cancel out. But is this also true when you throw some relativity into the mix? "
370,Can the shedding of radiation of stars contribute to the red-shift of the universe?,The sun is losing mass(1.5cm per year) by emitting radiation and the orbits of the planets are widening because of the weakening gravity of the sun.    Are most of the stars shedding mass via radiation also decreasing the total mass of the universe contribute to the increasing redshift of the universe?   Aside from the loss in mass/gravity. How much force is coming from the radiation pushing on itself from inside the universe?   Where does all that lost mass from radiation go from the universe? 
371,Why do rocky planets form?,"When a star system forms from a cloud of gas and dust, why doesn't the dust migrate towards the centre of gravity with the gas to form a star? Why does dust in the accretion disk aggregate to form rocky planets, rather than fall into the proto-star? "

Days 1581 to 1587 the light curve is exactly flat (also days 803-809 not shown here). Is the real data for those periods lost?   Are such features commonplace or another particularity for KIC 8462852?

374,Affordable night sky photography,"As an amateur with limited budget, I'd be interested in taking photos of the night sky, trying to capture more detail than human eye armed with a lens of comparable parameters to what I have in my camera normally could see. I doubt I'd ever get down to details as fine as Jupiter's moons, but I'd hope to see detail of some nebulae I have a hard time seeing through my inexpensive telescope, stars too dim to notice in less-than-perfect conditions etc. I'm interested in taking full-sky images just as well as zooms on specific objects too.  Currently, I have a lower-end SLC camera, with two lenses - good sharpness though lower aperture with 50-120mm focal length, and a wide-angle, high-brightness one (about 12-50mm) currently. Firmware hacks allow me to take photos of arbitrarily long time, and I have the remote to start and stop it without touching the camera, and generally software-wise the camera is quite powerful. One of the lenses (the longer focal length) is of ""standard professional"" quality level too.  Is this sufficient to get started? If so, what kind of settings should I use? If not, what other kind of entry-level equipment would I need to obtain/build on budget to get started with night sky photography? "
375,Declination calculation,"My task is to calculate current declination and right ascension for some artificial Earth satellite. For example ISS.   I am using latest TLE data for extracting keplerian orbital elements and then calculate current cartesian orbital state vectors in ECI frame.  From the position vector I directly calculate declination and right ascension, using cartesian to spherical coordinates conversion.  Right ascension gets calculated correctly but I am having problems getting the same result for declination as the one displayed by satellite trackers.  Speaking of satellite trackers, I don't understand how is their declination value even correct.  Declination is an angle measured north or south of the celestial equator.   Celestial equator of course is on the same plane as the equator of Earth.  Then how is it possible that, when a satellite (ISS in this example) is almost directly above Earth's equator, satellite trackers calculate declination to be around -29° ?      Shouldn't the declination angle be zero?  My calculations for this ""ISS above equator"" example did give declination to be close to 0°.  Who is doing the calculations wrong and why? "

377,Are Barlow Lenses Good For Deep Sky Observing?,"I'm using a 750mm (focal length) by 150mm (aperture) newtonian reflector and I've been curious about using Barlow lenses on deep sky objects.   Some of the astronomers at my local observatory say that if you get the lens selection correct so you don't lose any light through the eyepiece, you don't need a Barlow lens. While others say that the Barlow lens doubling the focal length of the telescope allows me to see deep sky objects better than without it.   So, is a Barlow lens an effective tool for deep sky observing? If not, what should I use it for?  Note: I already have a 2x Barlow lens. "
378,Is it possible for two stars to be in a horseshoe orbit around a much larger star?,"I was reading about how Saturn has two moons, Janus and Epimetheus, that swap orbits once every four years.

One thing that would make me more comfortable than an argument gedankenexperiment involving a modified Crookes radiometer with the gas removed would be some kind of experiment showing that simply being exposed to some very low pressure hydrogen, or photons, can make dust spin at anything close to 20 GHz!  These days optical trapping of particles in very high vacuum is readily accessible for example, so I think if someone wanted to try to make GHz-spinning-dust they could certainly have a go.

Aparently planets can't form with the amount o angular momentum the system has in its early stages. I think I understand where that excess comes from, the collapse of the nebula onto itself and provoking a spin. Then there are many hypothesis on how it's evacuated, which are mostly pretty logical.  Now my question, as a beginner in the study of physics, is this: Why does the angular momentum even need to be evacuated? If the angular momentum is too big, why can't planets still form? Does this have something to do with too much kinetic energy in the system? Thank you! "

I believe it can be done, or theoretically be done using gravity itself as a ""force"" that pushes outwards instead of inwards. A similar question was asked here, which speaks about why objects in the universe are round, which as stated, is due to Gravity. I understand Gravity is the strongest, most consistent ""force"" in the universe and to traverse it we have to push against it - jets, propulsion, etc. Never the less, I am perplexed why gravity's forces make objects round - eventually or over time. Why can't it turn a planet into a cube for example? Why can't Gravity make objects flat, and perhaps round at the perimeter? If I can answer this question, I am sure I can find a way to ""bend"" Gravity for my invention. "

399,Looking for help in understanding how black holes can move,"I'm looking for help in understanding how black holes can move through space. This is probably a trivial question for anyone who knows astronomy, but probably due to my lack of education on the topic, I can't come up with an answer or visualization on my own.  Specifically, my confusion is as follows:   I saw Dr. Kip Thorne in a documentary on black holes state that there is no longer any matter in a black hole once it forms. He said something like, the matter was there, but it has been crushed out of existence and basically has been transformed into the energy that produces such a great curvature of spacetime. From that description, it seems to me that within the event horizon of a black hole it is simply this enormous ""dent"" in spacetime itself that is moving around.  I also saw Dr. Andrew Hamilton in another documentary state that within the event horizon of a black hole (again paraphrasing), space is falling toward the singularity so fast that it effectively drags everything with it (including light). Based on 1 (no matter remains in the black hole) and 2 (space is being pulled towards the gravitational singularity from all directions), I try to picture the black hole moving, and it seems to me that if, say, the black hole moves in one direction, I can see how its event horizon is also moving, bringing that bit of space into it. But how can the other end of the black hole let space ""escape"" in order to complete the motion?    I am pretty sure I am just missing something here, because as I have learned, black holes have been found in galaxies and solar systems and many other places where they have to be moving. But I want to understand why it is that space itself can cross the event horizon when other things can't. And along those lines, it seems amazing to me that a black hole could be in essence a kind of scar in spacetime that can also move through it.  Thanks for any help and sorry for the wordy question.   UPDATE: Thanks for the answers so far. I hope someday I'll be able to comprehend them fully. :-)  I would like to add some further context that better illustrates my question.  If you go to the video here and watch the first minute or so (up to around 31:00)  [website]you can see Andrew Hamilton explaining what I have a question about along with an animation to illustrate the description.   On the one hand, we have spacetime curved in such a way that the black hole structure remains intact - that is, there is a constant event horizon generated by that extreme curvature. But on the other hand, Dr. Hamilton describes a flow of spacetime between the event horizon and the inner horizon, and he says it is plausible that within that area, space itself (which has no substance, in his words) can be described as flowing in and being flung back out.   I don't understand how space can have these two opposing properties - (1) a curvature that is maintained in order for the black hole to exist, that is, a curvature generated because matter can interact with the space and (2) a flow of space that sounds like it is not subject to a restriction of crossing back out of the event horizon.  It's that apparent difference between (1) and (2) that I want to understand better.  Thanks! "

401,Does rotation affect gravitational lines of force,"I was reading about rotating pulsars and other more-massive objects spinning at absurd speeds (hundreds of revolutions per second), and there was one point of which I was not clear.

402,Why is there so much methane in space?,"In school I learned that methane is organic matter and that it is a possible product of crude oil refinement. However, recently I read that Uranus has huge methane storms and the Saturn moon Titan even has lakes consisting only of methane or ethane.   Now, I'm wondering, how does all that methane get out there?   Is it the result of organic processes or is it created in the cores of suns like other elements? Do we even know?  Methane is also a pretty complex material. Do we know sources of more complex molecules other than methane in such quantities? Except life on earth?  "
403,Mean and true Sun,"I have problems to understand the point of ""mean sun"" and ""true sun"". As I understood the mean sun is set in the center of the earth orbit (which is a circle). So Ptolemy, Copernicus and Brahe used the ""mean sun"", however they knew that this isn't the real position of the sun? Did they do that due to the reason it would fit with the mars oppositions?*  (*Three of them used circles to describe orbits of planets. But if they want to link that together with the observations it wouldn't fit.)  Is that right? So even Ptolemy knew that the sun isn't in the middle of the orbit of the earth?

404,Deducing distance of closest neighbor galaxy from expression of correlation and mean galaxy density,"The original post was on physics exchange but I prefer to move it here :  I am trying to estimate the distance of closest galaxy neighbor knowing the expression of number of neighbors [tex] into a volume [tex], the mean density [tex] and the correlation function, i.e with this expression:  [tex]  with [tex].   I must precise that expression of [tex] is valid for [tex] between [tex]  I take into my calculation the following value for [tex] : I tried to choose a typical value for this density but it depends on which scale we consider (galaxy cluster, super cluster, very large scales ...), so maybe don't focus on this value.  What it interests me is to have elements to answer to the following question : How could I infer the distance of the closest galaxy from us?  UPDATE 1: Maybe I should take the lower limit of validity for the definition of [tex], i.e [tex] and so:  [tex]  So I would have:  [tex]  But by taking [tex], I am already located myself like the closest neighbor was at [tex], am I not ?  Is this reasoning correct?  Any help is welcome  "

407,"When astronomers ""look into the past"" are they accounting for the expansion of space?","Every time astronomers look ""13 billion"" years into the past, not only is there more space than there normally would be at that instant which increases from observation to observation, but there was also expanding space for eons prior to that which must offset photons over those billions of years.

408,How do they know how far out Farout is? (2018 VG18),"The Carnegie Science article Discovered: The Most-Distant Solar System Object Ever Observed begins:     Washington, DC— A team of astronomers has discovered the most-distant body ever observed in our Solar System.  It is the first known Solar System object that has been detected at a distance that is more than 100 times farther than Earth is from the Sun.      The new object was announced on Monday, December 17, 2018, by the International Astronomical Union’s Minor Planet Center and has been given the provisional designation 2018 VG18. The discovery was made by Carnegie’s Scott S. Sheppard, the University of Hawaii’s David Tholen, and Northern Arizona University’s Chad Trujillo.      2018 VG18, nicknamed “Farout” by the discovery team for its extremely distant location, is at about 120 astronomical units (AU), where 1 AU is defined as the distance between the Earth and the Sun.  The second-most-distant observed Solar System object is Eris, at about 96 AU.  Pluto is currently at about 34 AU, making 2018 VG18 more than three-and-a-half times more distant than the Solar System’s most-famous dwarf planet.      2018 VG18 was discovered as part of the team’s continuing search for extremely distant Solar System objects, including the suspected Planet X, which is sometimes also called Planet 9.  In October, the same group of researchers announced the discovery of another distant Solar System object, called 2015 TG387 and nicknamed “The Goblin,” because it was first seen near Halloween.  The Goblin was discovered at about 80 AU and has an orbit that is consistent with it being influenced by an unseen Super-Earth-sized Planet X on the Solar System’s very distant fringes.      The existence of a ninth major planet at the fringes of the Solar System was first proposed by this same research team in 2014 when they discovered 2012 VP113, nicknamed Biden, which is currently near 84 AU.    That's great! But the next bit confuses me.     The discovery images of 2018 VG18 were taken at the Japanese Subaru 8-meter telescope located atop Mauna Kea in Hawaii on November 10, 2018.      Once 2018 VG18 was found, it needed to be re-observed to confirm its very distant nature. (It takes multiple nights of observing to accurately determine an object’s distance.)  2018 VG18 was seen for the second time in early December at the Magellan telescope at Carnegie’s Las Campanas Observatory in Chile.  These recovery observations were performed by the team with the addition of graduate student Will Oldroyd of Northern Arizona University.  Over the next week, they monitored 2018 VG18 with the Magellan telescope to secure its path across the sky and obtain its basic physical properties such as brightness and color.      The Magellan observations confirmed that 2018 VG18 is around 120 AU, making it the first Solar System object observed beyond 100 AU.  Its brightness suggests that it is about 500 km in diameter, likely making it spherical in shape and a dwarf planet. It has a pinkish hue, a color generally associated with ice-rich objects.   Question(s):   How was the value of 120 AU actually determined?  or at least, how could it be determined if the explanation isn't readily available? Is this measurement more of an orbit reconstruction, or a parallax measurement of current distance?   below: ""Discovery images of 2018 VG18, nicknamed 'Farout,' from the Subaru Telescope on November 10, 2018. Farout moves between the two discovery images while the background stars and galaxies do not move over the one hour between images. Image is courtesy of Scott S. Sheppard and David Tholen.""

409,Statistics of elements abundance in exoplanets,"Recently, I encountered the concept of carbon planets - planets, which would be, unlike the Earth, formed mostly by carbon, instead of oxygen, silicon and magnesium. (I am not counting iron, which is mostly locked in the core). Now, I am interested in the planetary chemical compositions in general. I found interesting articles investigating the topic of variance of the planetary chemical compositions (for example here or here), but it is quite hard for me to make an overall picture of the state in the field.  I would like to ask on these things:  1. What typical compositions of terrestrial planets are expected to occur? (I guess there will be plenty of correlations, some groups of elements occuring together as they are bound, for example to the CNO cycle or other nuclear cycle.)  2. How much different the chemical compositions of terrestrial planets really are? (I.e. are all terrestrial planets mostly similar to each other, or should one rather expect that every planetary system has unique ratios of elements?) "

Now, the question is what will be the new orbit of the object around the other body? What are all the components of that orbit such as eccentricity, perihelion. Can the system even be solved exactly or only analytically?   "

413,Did this paper just argue that there is surely life on Titan?,"I just read the popular press version of a new paper, and now I have a question about Titan.  Here are some quotes from the pop article:     A rocky, ocean-bearing planet with more than 0.1 percent methane in its atmosphere should be considered a potentially inhabited planet, the researchers say. And if the atmospheric methane reaches levels of 1 percent or more? In that case, “potentially” doesn’t cut it—such a world would “likely” be home to alien life.   ...     Thus, methane and carbon dioxide together, unaccompanied by carbon monoxide, on a rocky, ocean-bearing world would best be interpreted as an airtight sign of anoxic life.   Now, some information about Titan from the Wikipedia page about Titan:  Titan's atmosphere     Stratosphere:         98.4% nitrogen         1.4% methane         0.2% hydrogen     Lower troposphere:         95.0% nitrogen         4.9% methane         -OR, depending on who you ask-         97% nitrogen         2.7% methane      The density of Titan is consistent with a body that is about 60% rock and 40% water.      There are trace amounts of other hydrocarbons, such as [...] carbon monoxide [...].   If I understand correctly, 'trace amounts' of CO is in line with the requirements stated in the Catling paper.

419,How do observational astronomers manage streaks and other artifacts from objects in Earth Orbit?,"There are thousands of satellites and spent rocket parts in low earth orbit (LEO). Mostly near the lines of dawn and dusk they can be in sunlight while observatories below are still viewing the night sky, as are the observatories like Hubble (also in LEO).  They are moving roughly 7 km/sec and as seen from Earth that motion will be roughly a half-degree per second, depending on distance.  Considering the number of observatories imaging the sky at any moment and the number of objects in LEO, streaks across images must be happening quite regularly.  While that would strongly impact a one-hour exposure on emulsion, these days solid state imaging is used and these are probably regularly buffered to provide the dynamic range necessary to capture dim objects with very bright images in the same field.   While a fraction of a second streak by a satellite will not normally completely obliterate a long exposure, it is still a problem and it seems would have to be managed in an accepted and systematic way.  Question: How do observational astronomers manage streaks and other artifacts from objects in LEO? Since these things are (usually) carefully tracked and their trajectories predictable, do observatories, or at least observers, ever plan ahead for these events, or schedule to avoid them? Or is it just handled automatically in post-processing?

420,Brown dwarfs and planets,"As far as I know, a brown dwarf is a 'star' whose core never underwent a fusion reaction, so it never became a star.   So I was wondering if, apart from orbiting a star, is there any difference between a massive planet and a brown dwarf?   I heard that they found an exoplanet 5 times the mass of Jupiter, and say a brown dwarf was in a binary pair where the other is a star: What stops it from being classified as a planet?   I guess what I am really asking for is a clearer definition of a brown dwarf. "

If an earth-like planet were orbiting our nearest star, excluding the sun :-), would we have detected it by now?    It seems current techniques tend to find large planets orbiting close to their star, or for direct observation, find large planets further away from their star.  Likewise, we have found many very large planets very close to their star (e.g. hot Jupiters), and some rocky planets somewhat larger than earth close to stars, but not very many (if any) that are very similar to earth (e.g. distance from star and size).

427,Earth's Versus Catastrophic Meteor,"How evasive is the Earth to Catastrophic Meteors?  Google says the Earth is approximately 92.96 million miles from the Sun. It also says the suns radius is 432,474 miles.  Therefore, it is 93,392,474 miles from the Earth to the center of the Sun:  92,960,000 + 432,474 = 93,392,474 miles   I've heard the Earth's orbit is elliptical, but to keep things simple, let's just say the orbit is a perfect circle. Therefore the radius of this circle is 93,392,474 miles. This would mean the diameter of our orbit would be 186,784,948 miles:  93,392,474 x 2 = 186,784,948 miles   The circumference of a circle is π x the diameter of a circle. Therefore, the number of miles in Earth's orbit would be about 586,504,736.72 miles:  3.14 x 186,784,948 = 586,504,736.72 miles   So, the Earth travels about 586,504,736.72 miles in one year. Since there are 365 days in year, that would mean that Earth travels about 1,606,862 miles in one day.  586,504,736.72 ÷ 365 = 1,606,862.292383562   That would mean the Earth travels about 66,953 miles per hour:  1,606,862.292383562 ÷ 24 = 66952.595515982   And this would mean the Earth travels about 1,116 miles per minute:  66952.595515982 ÷ 60 = 1115.876591933   Lastly, this would mean the Earth travel about 18.6 miles per second:  1115.876591933 ÷ 60 = 18.597943199   Google says the diameter of the Earth is 7,917.5 miles. So, as fast as the Earth is traveling, a catastrophic meteor has about a 7 minute window to hit target Earth.  7917.5 ÷ 18.597943199 = 425.719119329 seconds 425.719119329 ÷ 60 = 7.095318655 minutes   What are the odds of a catastrophic meteor hitting the Earth?

430,Expansion and Gravity,If space is undergoing accelerated expansion then regions of space are becoming inaccessible to us even at light speed. If gravity is bounded by light speed then inaccessible regions of space no longer contribute gravitational influence on us. If true wouldn't gravity waves... tiny variations in gravity given sensitive enough equipment... be all around us as matter crosses the threshold and becomes inaccessible to us? Does this violate conservation? 
431,Are black holes really singularities?,"Can't black holes just be super dense objects? They could still be black (having the color of black never really required special physics, after all) and have a really strong gravitational field. If we suspect that it actually absorbs light due to its gravity then it is possible that there is gravity strong enough to capture light, not letting any radiate out when matter falls into this object.  I'm just having a hard time accepting that anything can exist with an infinitely large property as it would lead to infinitely large mass leading to infinitely large forces... that would just destroy the universe infinitely fast, wouldn't it? So I think a supermassive object can be a badass just as well without having to be a singularity. "
432,What was earth's mass before the collision with theia?,"Assume the ""Big Splash"" or ""Giant Impact"" (whichever name you prefer) theory is more or less correct.   EDIT: With so many variations of this theory, with so many names and qualifiers on them, such as ""direct impact theory"" and ""glancing blow hypothesis"", etc., let's assume that the impact was direct enough that nothing of Theia (other than Earth and the Moon) was left that was large enough to for its gravity to compress it into a hydrostatically equilibrious shape, and scatters too much to coalesce (on its own) in to anything large enough either.   Assume ""Theia"" was the size of Mars (some variations on the theory use other sizes, but for the sake of this question, let' stick with Mars)  How big was Earth before the impact?    It can't be as simple as ""Earth+moon-Theia(mars)=pre-impact size"", can it?  Because there must have been some debris ejected completely from the earth+moon system, right? or was it such a small amount that it can be considered negligible?  "

This high density suggests a comparatively large iron core (compared to the rest of the planet).  Recent studies reported in ""NASA Antenna Cuts Mercury to Core, Solves 30 Year Mystery"" (NASA, 2007) have confirmed the presence of a molten core, surrounded by a silicate mantle (depicted in the illustration below (from the article):    The question is then, what is the current accepted theory as to Mercury has a still-molten core and a density like that of Earth?

434,Orbital resonances and position of planets,"I am interested in quick generation of planetary systems for programs similar to Space Engine or Pioneer Space Simulator.

Which resonances are stable, and which are unstable in the long term evolution of the planetary system? "

439,Expansion of Space,If Space is expanding between the Galaxies then why isn't it also expanding between the Stars within the Galaxies as well ? In fact why isn't Space expanding within our Solar System ? 
440,Are galaxies moving away from us faster than before?,Are all galaxies moving away from us at constant speed even those that may be moving in our direction as the space is being formed? How does nothingness appear to push matter? A black hole sucks as space is compressing (being stretched without stopping) or compressed (like how our Sun pulling all planets) and is it the opposite phenomenon that show universe is expanding? 
441,Parking a telescope at a Lagrange point: is this a good idea from a debris point of view?,"The James Webb space telescope is supposed to be located at the Earth-Sun L2 Lagrange point.   Do we expect the region around that point to have a higher concentration of space debris, asteroids, dust, etc...? Would this be a matter of concern for bringing the telescope safely in position (i.e. require extra dust shield)? Do we expect however the exact Lagrange point to be free of any matter since it would take an acceleartion/deceleration for matter to actually reach that exact location? How large would be this 'debris-free' zone? "

443,How a star's rotation affects a star in the main sequence?,"I searched and have found that the questions mainly focus on neutron stars, white dwarves and black holes. This was not what I looked for.  Basically, the bigger the star's mass is, the more intense is its fusion reaction and the shorter is its lifespan in the main sequence. Now, imagine that a star spins much faster. There will be less surface gravity at the equator than at the poles. How does a fast rotation affect the star's fusion reaction?   Will the pressure of the star's mass on its core be lower at the equator and therefore reduce nuclear fusion rate? Will there be a deeper convection because of the Coriolis effect? What shall we notice in term of longevity in the main sequence, luminosity and emission spectrum of a fast rotating star compared to a slow rotating one of the same initial mass?  "
444,Aaditya L1 mission ISRO,"ISRO's next mission to the Sun is Aditya-L1, (also here), which will be placed at the Sun-Earth Lagrangian point L-1.   Why it is not placed near L-4 or L-5, since these are stable equilibrium point whereas L-1 is unstable equilibrium? What is the advantage to placing Sun-observing satellites like Aditya near the L-1 point? "
445,Could there be Earth-like planets in binary or trinary systems?,"Could Earth-like (suitable for Human habitation) planets exist in systems with 2 or 3 suns, have any been found?  With more than a single star, isn't it likely that the habitation zone would be too irregular, gravitational forces be irregular/strong and numerous other issues? "
446,Is it possible that the Sun has a binary partner (the Nemesis Theory) that has eluded detection?,"I just recently learned about the theory that our Sun has a small companion star with a 26 million year orbit. This theory came about when it was realized that mass extinction events happened approximately every 26 million years. My question is not whether or not this is possible as that has been asked before; my question is how could we have missed it?   When we look for exoplanets in the Universe, we are sometimes able to detect a slight wobble in the parent stars. Along those lines, if the Sun had a companion star, how would we not notice the effects on its rotation/orbit? If the sun and this companion star were locked in a 26 million year orbit, would we be able to notice the orbit?   Finally, when you have a star system like ours, with so many planets, is it possible to tell which planet is causing which specific motion in the Sun? For example, let's say we traveled to a different star system a few hundred light years away, and we were studying our solar system. Would we be able to look at the way the Sun wobbles and determine how many planets were in orbit around our Sun, or would we only be able to say that there was one, or simply that there may be several? I guess, the root question is how accurately can we judge the contents of a star system based on the perturbations in the star's orbit? Thank you kindly for your time.  "
447,Do unattached objects contribute to a planet's gravity?,"If you could measure Earth's gravity with infinite precision, and did so both with Earth and its full population, and Earth with no people, would there be a direct difference in gravity? Is this even a valid way to think of gravity? "
448,Is the surface of TrES-2b actually dark?,"The exoplanet TrES-2b is known as the darkest planet ever found, reflecting &lt;1% of the light that hits it.  What does it mean in respect to the surface? What would we see below the atmosphere of this planet? Is it a ""shadow planet"" with an atmosphere so thick and dense that it blocks all light that would reach the surface? "
449,Is there a variation of ISO 8601 for julian calendar dates?,"If I want to write a date in the Gregorian calendar, I can write it in the ISO 8601 format; today would be 2016-02-20. The advantage is that there are many parsers available to let computers read in this kind of date. But what if I want to write a Julian calendar date, as astronomers often do? Is there a similar widely-accepted format, and selection of parsers, to use with the Julian calendar.  While I'm at it, what if it's an ancient date where we don't know how many solar days ago it was; instead it is an astronomical phenomenon calculated in Terrestrial Time (more or less atomic time) or by dating decay of radioactive elements? Is there a standard way of writing such a date? "
450,How do you calculate local time from local sidereal time?,"There are many calculators online to convert local time to local sidereal time, but I can't find any resources to convert the other way.  Can you convert back by doing the same conversion backwards?  I found equations on this website to convert to LST.  Would it be valid to use this equation to convert back:  $$ UT = \frac{LST - \frac{L}{15} - 6.697374558 - 2400.051336*T - 0.000025862*T^2)}{1.0027379093} $$  where [tex] is the time in Universal Coordinated Time, [tex] is the Local Sidereal Time, [tex] is the longitude, and [tex] is:  $$ T = \frac{JD-2451545.0}{36525.0} $$ where JD is the Julian Date at noon UTC.  Once I've calculated the time in UT, I then add or subtract 24 until the result is within 0 - 24 hours.  Then I can convert from UT to local time.  I would prefer to have this as accurate as possible.  I did a calculation using this, but according to Stellarium I was off by about an hour.  Could this be due to Daylight Savings time or something?  Here is the Python code I made to do the calculation.  LST = 8 + ((37 + (5.642/60))/60) JD0 = 2457813.5 L = - 106.6056 GMST = LST - L/(365/(23 + ((56 + (4.1/60))/60))) T = (JD0 - 2451545)/36525 UT = (GMST - 6.697374558 - 2400.051336*T - 0.000025862*(T*T))/1.0027379093   while UT &lt;0:     UT += 24   LT = UT - 7  while LT &lt; 0:     LT += 24  "

453,A point of light moving between the stars,"I noticed you replied to a question before about this topic and i came across your answer. Way back in the 80s when i was in my teens i saw a point of light moving between the stars at a steady rate across the sky. It was about the same size and brightnesz of those visible. It was moving in such a was as it approached a star ir veered off left or right then continued on its original path across the night sky. I showed my sister who was older than me at the time. It kind of reminded me of a whiplash efect using gravity to maintain spèed. Mabie too much Star Trek, but you get the idea. I am not an astronomer so forgive my ignorance, but a plane or a satalite would not move in this manor would it? I am convinced to this day that it was not one of ours. Can you clarify this as it was definately avoiding the stars? "
454,Is dark energy evenly spaced throughout Universe?,Are there certain parts of the Universe that are expanding faster than others? Is there anyway to definitively measure this? 
455,Is there any update on the Availability of Event Horizon Telescope Images?,"There has been no news on the obvious public channels from the EHT project since last (Northern) summer. Does anyone have more information on when any results from the April 2017 run might be released?   A secondary question is has the data from the April 2018 run been successfully gathered? I know they have to wait for Antarctic spring to ship the hard drives from the South pole, but that should have arrived a couple of months ago. "
456,Could science be lost if a phenomena is observed before predicted?,"An observation could validate the predictions made by a previous theory. If something unpredicted is observed, then a new theory which is compatible with the observation should make predictions which later are confirmed by new observations.  But what if no such new predictions are possible to make? What is the scientific status of a theory which after the fact is only compatible with all data, but which cannot make any new predictions? If it would be considered weak, does this mean that discoveries through observation can actually destroy science?  Is this a valid argument for delaying the construction of better observatories until theories have matured given all existing data? Kind of comparable with the forward planetary protection argument which says that human spaceflight to Mars should wait until it is certain that there's no life there which could go extinct when it meets Earthly life. "
457,Maximum distance for earth eclipse,"First of all sorry if this question was already asked, but I made a small search here and on google and I couldn't find any answer, so.. Here I am.  I was reading NASA's webpage about the Webb telescope, and I noticed that they are saying that one of the sides will be very hot.  I thought that one of the reasons to put the telescope on the L2 point was to avoid ""seeing"" the Sun, but apparently the L2 point is too far to have Earth fully cover the Sun.  So.. What is the maximum distance from Earth you have to be in order to have our planet block the Sun? Of course neglecting the effect of the atmosphere, which creates a sort of ""halo"" even if the Sun is fully covered.  Moreover what will the telescope see towards the sun? Just the star with a very tiny dot in the middle, or a very big black dot (optionally with the moon moving around it), or... What?  Thank you "
458,Why are the high density regions in outer space black holes?,"The escape velocity of an object is given by the following formula.  [tex]  As far as I am aware, the mass of the star which formed the black hole is the same as the black hole itself, the only difference is the black hole's density.   Now, the escape velocity of the star which formed the black hole is not as high because light can escape the star. Considering the equation above, [tex] is constant, [tex] is constant, however, [tex] changes resulting in a much smaller region as compared to the star. Consequently, it's the radius which determines the high escape velocity of a black hole, not its density. Then why is it that I always hear that black holes behave the way they do because they are highly dense regions in spacetime? What am I getting wrong? Thanks. "
459,North Pole Right Ascension/Declination to axial tilt conversion,"Wikipedia , on several asteroid articles, claims that right ascension and declination of the North Pole can give you the axial tilt of the object. What formula is used to convert these 2 values into the axial tilt? (Ceres, for example, has an R.A. Of 291 degrees and a declination of 59 degrees; its axial tilt is approximately 3 degrees. How is this figured? "
460,Why do astronomers use supernova to measure distance in space?,"Why can't the distances between our Sun and the celestial objects be measured directly and instead had to rely on looking around for supernova? Is these events frequent, evenly distributed and lasting enough for astronomers to measure any place in our observable universe? Is this method of measurement more preferable than others currently?does this method had any limitations such as an absent of supernova nearby? "
461,Apparent size of the super blue blood moon,"Is it normal that super blue blood moon is much smaller than before the eclipse? If so, why? I'm quite positive it's not cloudy here. On my TV, they broadcast a live super blue blood moon from the 4th floor, and it looks big and red. You think they use a telescope? "
462,Do the gases in the Earth's atmosphere affect the color of a lunar eclipse?,"As the sun's rays pass through the Earth's atmosphere only the red light gets through. Is this the result of specific gases in the Earth's atmosphere filtering the red light?  Does all of the nitrogen and oxygen affect the sunlight shining through it?  Let's say the Earth (or just about any earth-like planet) has an atmosphere made mostly of green chlorine. When the sun shines through the chlorine atmosphere and hits the moon during a lunar eclipse, would the moon appear green? Would different gases result in the moon becoming different colors? "
463,Precession of the Equinox,"I just learned about precession of the equinox, i.e. the Earth's axis tilts one degree every 72 years.   And it takes 72 years/degree x 360 degrees =  25,920 (years in one cycle)  There are many theories to this, i.e.   Sun's gravity is affecting the tilt of Earth's axis Sun itself is revolving around another star, and it takes 25,920 years, hence the slow tilt of Earth's axis   I googled whether the Sun revolves around something else, and according to NASA.gov, Sun revolves around center of Milky Way it it takes 230 million years.  Now, I am confused between precession of the equinox and Sun revolving around another star.  Does precession of the equinox have anything to do with the Sun revolving around another star? Or is it simply the Sun's gravity acting on the Earth?  What is the explanation according to modern science? I understand there were astronomers in the past who deduced that the Sun revolved around another star and it took 25,920 years. "

And if so, would it have appeared like a star that grew brighter and brighter each night?  * I know, there were no humans at the time. "
469,What is the current accepted theory for the fate of hot Jupiters?,"It is well established that one main feature of many hot jupiters is their close proximity to their parent star, usually the equivalent of being within the orbit of Mercury.  So, these planets are gas giants and are very hot (hence their category).  However, a few discoveries have lead to questioning about what is the fate of these planets.  example 1: HD 209458b  a.k.a. ""Osiris""  According to the NASA page ""Dying Planet Leaks Carbon-Oxygen"", Osiris is doing more than 'evaporating', it is leaking carbon, oxygen alongside hydrogen in an envelope behind the planet that has been detected from Earth.  The significance of carbon and oxygen is stated from the article:     Although carbon and oxygen have been observed on Jupiter and Saturn, it is always in combined form as methane and water deep in the atmosphere. In HD 209458b the chemicals are broken down into the basic elements. But on Jupiter or Saturn, even as elements, they would still remain invisible low in the atmosphere. The fact that they are visible in the upper atmosphere of HD 209458b confirms that atmospheric 'blow off' is occurring.   It is stated in the article that Osiris is likely to become a hypothesised class of exoplanet known as a Chthonian, which is defined in ""Evaporation rate of hot Jupiters and formation of Chthonian planets"" (Hebard et al. 2003) as     new class of planets made of the residual central core of former hot   Jupiters   These would be similar in size to Earth, but considerably denser.  example 2: CoRoT-7b  According to the NASA article ""Most Earthlike Exoplanet Started out as Gas Giant"", CoRoT-7b is an Earth-sized planet where a hot Jupiter usually is found, they describe it as     is almost 60 times closer to its star than Earth, so the star appears almost 360 times larger than the sun does in our sky,"" Jackson said. As a consequence, the planet's surface experiences extreme heating that may reach 3,600 degrees Fahrenheit on the daylight side. CoRoT-7b's size (70 percent larger than Earth) and mass (4.8 times Earth's) indicate that the world is probably made of rocky materials.    The high day time temperature means that the star-facing side of the planet is likely to be molten, any tenuous atmosphere is also blasted away.  Scientists estimate that many Earth-masses may have been boiled off.  It also seems that the decreasing mass is causing the planet to be drawn closer to the star  -cause more material to be boiled off, hence the mass to decrease.  To summarise on of the scientists in the article:     You could say that, one way or the other, this planet is disappearing before our eyes,""   The question  As these are only 2 examples of a possible process, the question is, what is the current accepted theory as to the fate of hot Jupiter exoplanets?  Could this also be the reason a hot Jupiter does not exist in our solar system? "
470,Strength of core-envelope coupling in stars,"For a star with a given Zero-Age Main Sequence (ZAMS) mass, as a function of metallicity how strongly is the star's core coupled to its envelope?  I understand that the core-envelope boundary is only (semi-) well defined for Main Sequence stars that do have a core, and that in principle the final spin (angular velocity) of the core should depend on the spin of the star prior to losing its envelope in a mass transfer event. I've read, here for instance, that the core should be nearly completely uncoupled from the envelope, however in this recent paper they assume that the coupling is sufficient enough to determine the natal spin of the stellar core (see figure 1).  Is there a simple way to understand the strength of core-envelope coupling in terms of the ZAMS quantities of the star, without performing full stellar population synthesis?  I asked this question at the Physics SE but it has received very little interest. "
471,Comparing Light Collection Between Pupil and Telescope?,"The amount of light collected for a period of time is proportional to the area of the collecting aperture. We use our eyes -pupils have diameters of approximately 5 mm-, binoculars and telescopes. How much more light can we collect with a 50mm pair of binoculars compared with our eyes? And with an 8-inch telescope? If we could have access to a 10-meter class professional telescope, how large would the gain be?  50^2/5^2= 100 times more light  8in = 203.2 mm  203.2^2/5^2= 1652 times more light  10000^2/5^2= 4000000 times more light  Did I solve this problem correctly?

474,Location of the milky way in August in Death Valley,"I am going to be in Death Valley around August 8th. I was hoping to take a milky way shot with my camera when there. I would be shooting around 10pm.  I am using google maps to scout out popular viewpoints in Death Valley for potential locations for the shot, as I will be getting terrestrial objects in the frame.  From what I have read , I believe the milky way will be visible most of the night, and best viewable in the earlier hours of the night. In addition it will be in the south sky.   So will it be precisely due south? Or will it be slightly south west or south east? If I could pinpoint the location, it would be easier to scout out a spot.  Thanks! "
475,Will gravitational waves too far away ever reach us?,"Gravity is the curvature of spacetime, and its effects travel at lightspeed. However, space is expanding; eventually, light from distant galaxies will become more and more redshifted, and we will no longer be able to see them (source).  As such, there is a limit to how far we could ever possibly see, since light too far will never reach us due to the rapid expansion of space...or at least, if I'm understanding this correctly.  Now, gravitational waves travel at lightspeed. So, after enough time, when an object's light no longer reaches us, will its gravity no longer affect us either?  A better rephrasing is: at a certain point in time, will the gravity of any extremely distant object — even the most massive stars, black holes, or galaxies — simply not affect us whatsoever, in the slightest? "
476,Telescope and its construction,"I want to build a reflecting telescope in my home. I've attached a drawing of my plan that contains some explanations of what I understand so far, and highlights the parts of the design for which I have questions.  What type of mirror should i use, parabolic or spherical, and what are the factors considered when making that decision?   Does the glass used to make the mirror affect the incoming light rays? What about the secondary mirror in the middle of the tube?  Are there other things to consider that would help for higher magnification?   Some telescopes have a glass window at the front where light enters the tube, why is that? Would I need to add it here?   "
477,What practical considerations are there for amateur observations of transiting exoplanets?,"Obviously, I am not referring to actual viewing of the exoplanets themselves, but detecting their effects on the brightness of the light emitted from the parent star (as in the diagram below from The Institute of Astronomy, University of Hawaii).      I would imagine that a good quality telescope, would be about to detect and record the effects of the exoplanet transiting the parent star.

Why? about the tides transferring energy to the Moon and pushing it from Earth, I have a question:  How is that energy actually being transferred to the Moon? The creation of tides requires energy, so I would expect that this should take energy from the Moon, slow it and cause it to eventually fall back to the Earth. Why isn't that happening?  Finally, if this is the general mechanism, would other moons that orbit around planets with a liquid surface and causing tides, be receding from their parent planets? "

If you measured the parallax to Arcturus, 90 mas**, how luminous would Arcturus be?  I am struggling with solving this problem. I realize that I might need the formula: [tex] for flux vs. luminosity and distance, but I do not know how to solve it.

482,What is the specific term for time of the night when there is no moon?,"There are times when the sun goes down and it takes a while for the moon to rise, because the moon obviously doesn't rise with the sunset whole year. I guess this happens only when the moon is full. Also, in some days, moon sets in the midnight and there is no moon on the sky for the rest of the night. So, I was wondering what that time period of the night is called when the moon has gone down, or has yet to rise? Can we call it 'moondown'? I am not talking about the new moon when there is no moon the whole night. Please help, and thank you in advance! "

Is there a schedule for at what times it will be able to register new gravity waves? Even if no formal schedule is available, what main factors determine the scheduling?  I suppose VIRGO in Italy, to get started in 2016, will operate mostly simultaneously with aLIGO. Or would its design require another type of schedule? "
485,How to configure Celestia to work with a spherical mirror projection on a dome,"I find hints around the web, e.g. [website]The problem is that I can't find any documentation on how to configure Celestia to warp the generated image, so it can be used in such a projection setup.  For Stellarium\Nightshade I found some references, e.g. from spherical projection guru, Paul Bourke, and I expected to find similar resources for Celestia.   Can Celestia be configured for a spherical mirror projection system? Can you point me to documentation on how to set up Celestia for a spherical mirror projection system?

486,"How much of carbon, sodium, silicon, and magnesium does the Sun have?",I've just begun learning of Astronomy and I can't figure out why any stars would begin their life with such elements if nuclear fusion hasn't created them.

How did time behave during the radical inflation shortly after Big Bang? "
489,How far apart is the dust in the Sombrero Galaxy's dust lane?,"In his answer to this question, TildalWave made this remark:     I think that first, we have to properly appreciate the size of the Sombrero Galaxy. It is roughly 50,000 light years (15 kilo parsecs) in diameter. That might be only half of the diameter of our own Milky Way galaxy, but still makes each and every pixel on the photograph you're attaching in your question stretch more than 100 light years in distance.   Here's the photograph:    Since it almost feels like I can see individual 'pieces' of dust in the lane, it would follow that the particles must be very far apart. Just how far apart are they? Are they grouped in clumps, or relatively evenly space? "

492,In what manner is the spectrum of a black body really a continuum?,"Usually they say the spectrum of a black body is a continuum and emits radiation at every frequency. Is it really a continuum like a line or are there (small) intervals?  For example, can a body emit at 700nm and also at 400nm and everything in between, or at very small intervals like at 400.000001nm and 400.000002nm etc.? So is it really like a wave or line which implies a kind of infinity of wavelengths or is it more or less like discreet lengths although very close to each other? Or is it not really known because measuring is in a certain way always with discreet numbers (like 400.0001)?  As I understand it, it should always be at certain discreet numbers, firstly because the electrons from which the radiation comes only have a discreet values, and secondly because collisions between atoms/protons/electrons create energy at certain set wavelengths. But that is just my interpretation.  So what is the reality of black body radiation? "
493,Stellar data for data mining,"Where could I find detailed data from stars? Like spectrum, x ray and so on ?  Because I would like to do some data analysis on it.  "
494,Would Adaptive Optics be Useful in Radio Astronomy?,"This Question and Answer got me thinking. If atmospheric seeing at visible wavelengths is the result of refractive index inhomogeneity, would it also be a similar problem for mm to cm wavelengths? From a quick search, the index of refraction of air at STP is about 1.0003 (visible) and 1.0002 (radio).  If it is not, is there a way to understand quantitatively why it is not a problem?     Images from Wikipedia "
495,Why is it impossible to estimate the inclination of an exoplanet with the Radial Velocity Method?,"The formula of the radial velocity is:  [tex] with [tex]  Being [tex]the systematic velocity of the system, [tex] the mass of the planet, [tex] the mass of the star, [tex] the mean motion and [tex] is orbital period of planet, [tex] the length of the semi-major axis of the planet, [tex] the inclination of the orbital plane with the ecliptic, [tex] the eccentricity of the planet, [tex] the true anomaly at time [tex] and [tex] the longitude of periastron.  It's well known the usual procedure. You have data about the instances [tex], the radial velocities [tex] at time [tex] and then you also have the measurements uncertainties [tex]. With that data, you can estimate 6 parameters: [tex], [tex], [tex], [tex], [tex] (the periastron passage time) and [tex]. After you estimate these parameters, you can calculate (if you know the mass of the star and you assume that [tex]), [tex], which is known as the minimum mass. So, as far as this way shows, you got no way to estimate the mass of the planet and the inclination separately.   But what if instead of estimate this set of parameters, we introduce another one? Just one with all the parameters in the equation: [tex], [tex], [tex], [tex], [tex], [tex], etc.? Couldn't that be possible? But nonetheless, it's always assumed that it's impossible to know the inclination with the RV data. Is there some reason why? "
496,To what extent do the spin of smaller celestial bodies reflect the spin of the larger system’s of which they are a part?,"One can ask whether two objects are spinning in the same direction or not. For example, the Sun, Earth, Luna, most of our solar planets (except Venus and Uranus), and the planets’ satellites all spin in approximately the same direction. Likewise, the orbits of these bodies are in the same direction.   I understand that the rotational plane of our solar system is tilted about 60 degrees relative to our galaxy’s. If you project one rotation onto the plane of the other, I have the impression from maps that they may have opposite orientations — i.e. if we face north to south, our solar system’s rotation is counterclockwise, and our galaxy’s rotation is clockwise. Correct? What about the rotations at other scales of the larger systems we are in, such as our local star cluster, our local galactic cluster, and so forth? Thank you. "

Are there any disadvantages to 2-inch eyepieces? Are 2-inch eyepieces only advantageous with longer eyepieces?  
499,What is the light that we see from a neutron star come from?,What hold the electrons in orbit? Is it gravity or the atomic attraction between the protons and neutrons?   I asked this question on Physics SE I hope I improved on the quality enough to do better here.      Is the light we see from a neutron star from the neutrons or the electrons?

501,Can I build a telescope with a lens from a CD-ROM as eyepiece?,I saw some article on the web about making an eyepiece of a telescope with the lens from a CD-ROM. Will this really work? I have an objective lens of 100 cm focal length. What will be the magnification if I could make a refractive telescope? Can I see the planets and moon with that? Can anyone suggest the arrangement of the lenses? 
502,What are the current observational limits on the existence of Dyson spheres/swarms/rings?,"A Dyson sphere/swarm/ring is a hypothetical structure an extra-terrestrial entity would construct to collect a large fraction of its host star's light, and would likely generate a fairly strong infrared signature that could potentially be detected by modern infrared surveys (such as WISE). Do we have any meaningful constraints on the existence of these structures within the Milky Way (or beyond) from these surveys? What sorts of natural phenomena could be confused with such structures, if they existed? "
503,Would humans hear gravity waves from a binary BH fusion nearby?,"The frequency of the gravity waves detected by aLIGO recently were in the audible sound spectra. Actually spanning over half of the keys of a piano, I've been told, during 2/10 or so seconds.  Would a human ear sense a gravity wave if powerful enough? The waves going through empty space from the event horizons, through the walls of a spacecraft and through the ears of astronauts. Would one actually hear a ""zip"" sound because space makes waves inside our ears? "
504,"How did they make a video of the center of the galaxy, and what is it exactly that's flashing there?","The ESA video ESOcast 173: First Successful Test of Einstein’s General Relativity Near Supermassive Black Hole includes a clip of images of stars at the center of our galaxy orbiting around SgrA*, a presumed supermassive black hole. This isn't visible light because it's obscured by dust, so it may be radio or long wave infrared, but I don't know.  In the middle, I can see something flashing at whatever wavelength this image has been produced from.  Question:    How are these images obtained, and what process is it that is believed to be causing that flashing?   GIF made from video at around 02:50:      Six annotated frames from GIF highlighting the flashing that I'm seeing.   "
505,Is the Milky Way Galaxy predicted to collide with a neighboring galaxy?,"Topic  I've read several articles online that state that our galaxy will collide with a neighboring galaxy in the future, but there is no evidence about it happening.   Question(s)     After reading a few articles on the topic, I started to wonder:    When will it happen? Which galaxy will collide with our own? Is it even going to happen?   (your post should answer all three)  It's a scary but oddly interesting theory, and a little enlightenment would be much appreciated! :)  Not a duplicate--  I'm asking if the possibility that any galaxy will collide with our own, not just one. "
506,Can visible wavelength spectroscopy study an exoplanet's chemical composition directly?,"I know spectroscopy of light in visible wavelengths is very effective for studying and determining the chemical composition of bodies within the solar system and bright objects outside of it. However, can this same method be used with exoplanets?   In looking about some related articles, I've learned that it is possible, if a planet passes between us and its star, to filter out the star's light leaving only what passes through the planet's atmosphere. But what if there is no such occultation? Can we filter out the star's light in other wavelengths like UV or infrared and look at just the planet via its own emitted radiation (assuming the planet is large and hot as these are what we are most able to detect at this time)? "
507,What happens to the information on the event horizons of two merging black holes?,What happens to the hairiness/information on the horizons of two black holes if they collide?  After Hawkin the information of the matter which has fallen into the blackhole is encoded on the surface of the event horizon. What happens to the information of both blackholes when the event horizons merge?

513,At what wavelengths can black hole Sagittarius A* be observed from Earth?,"The supermassive black hole in the center of the Milky Way is blocked by dust and gas clouds as seen from where we are. Which wavelengths are blocked and which are most undisturbed for observation of Sagittarius A* and its immediate neighborhood? Does the matter between us change for example polarization at some wavelengths or cause disturbances other than blocking the light? Could galactic cosmic rays, heavy ions, from it be detected if they were emitted, or would they be deflected by magnetic fields?  By the way, at what distance from us is the most dust located? Is it concentrated in one region or are there several dust clouds in the way? "

If so, what primary differences in ratios and/or densities of gasses would have to exist? If not, why not? "
515,What observational constraints are there in detecting the presence of volcanism on exoplanets?,"This question is somewhat related to my earlier question How are the compositional components of exoplanet atmospheres differentiated?, but this about a specific surface-atmospheric phenomena - volcanism.  Using our solar system as a rough analogue (where asides from Earth, Venus, Io and Triton have active volcanism, probably more), volcanism should be not uncommon amongst exoplanets given the right conditions.  Obviously, we could probably only detect either the massive shield, plateau volcanism, or prolonged volcanism from multiple vents.  What observational constraints are there in detecting the presence of volcanism on exoplanets? "
516,How far above the Earth's surface does interplanetary space begin?,The Kármán line is often cited as the beginning of outer space.

Is it the Earth's magnetopause? 
517,How are the element abundances calculated for a meteorite in the Hydrogen log10 scale?,"In astronomy, solar abundances are often calculated or tabulated per [tex] H atoms.

521,"Detecting the Chicxulub impactor, right now","Say an asteroid identical in all ways to the Chicxulub impactor (size, mass, materiel, orbital type, etc) was about to hit us.  (Again!)  As of exactly early 2018,  given our known instruments and indeed our known watch-out-for-asteroid-collisions systems,  in fact,   when would it be a reasonable certainty, that we would know about it coming?  (Only days before hand?  Weeks - months - years - decades?)   Are there any gotchya factors?  (Such as ... we'd likely miss it if it came from 'above'? 'from the direction of the sun'?? etc.)  Any perhaps current limiting use cases?  (Something like ... ""anything over K km we'd know for sure Y years ahead of time, smaller than that no chance..."")  I guess, some folks on this list are familiar on a day to day basis with our ""known instruments and indeed our known watch-out-for-asteroid-collisions systems"" ...  but to the layman it's an unknown!  And technology is very topical, of course.  I guess the answer is changing in a Moore's Law -ish way from year to year.

522,Why does it take so long to transmit an image from New Horizons to Earth?,"I just got the news that the New Horizons space probe has passed by some remote planet on the edge of the solar system.   I was surprised that the guy from NASA says that it might take 24 months from us to get the photo of that planet.   The solar system is not that big, right? It is slow because the signal transmission is slow, right? But why is the transmission so slow? "
523,"How do we know how the Sun (or any star, for that matter) will evolve?","The evolutionary path of the Sun has been described in some detail, and, subtle differences aside, it's been described as such for decades - the Earth-engulfing red giant stage, the helium flash, etc.. It would seem that the knowledge necessary to make such a prediction has been around since the 60s, if not earlier.  How do we know it will happen, and on the timescales described? If we make some measurements/estimations of the mass and composition of the Sun, and use our understanding of nuclear physics - energy of fusion and so forth, and an understanding of Newtonian physics (or do we have to invoke Einstein?), do the predictions just inevitably fall out?  Could the predictions be wrong? Is there any significant measure of uncertainty, perhaps due to sensitivity of certain calculations to initial conditions, etc?  Is the red giant future of our Sun a firm conclusion, or just a likely possibility among a range of others and commonly talked about merely because it seems the most likely one? "
524,Need help understanding the recent observation of extra-galactic planets!,"The new paper Probing Planets in Extragalactic Galaxies Using Quasar Microlensing (also in ArXiv) is too mind-boggling for me to understand exactly what is happening.

There are thousands of planets seen in another galaxy, which do not orbit stars? There is discussion of ""emission close to the event horizon of the supermassive black hole of the background quasar""... there are too many unusual things going on at once for me to fathom.  Is it possible for someone to sort out the basics of what's happening? The Quasar is in front, and the galaxy containing these planets is behind? What emission? "

It orbits is such that a person who is on equator see this satellite on Zenith every 12Hours.  a. Find Satellite's Period.  b. What is distance of satellite to person when it Sets on person's horizon?  My problem with this question is:  For the first part: somewhere said period is 12hours. Somewhere else said the person on equator also moves (Earth Rotation) so 12 hours is P/2 and P= 24hours. What is the right answer?  For the second part: Which of the following figures show the position of satellite when it sets? (Figure 1 or 2?)     
526,How can a supernova cause a gravitational wave?,"With the recent results of LIGO, I read a lot how limited the detection capabilities where and how one could only expect to measure the most extreme events like black hole mergers and supernovae.  I get the black hole mergers, since here we see an ever higher frequency gravitational interference of two large bodies. But how can a supernova cause a gravitational wave? All the mass is still there, it is just thrown out  isn't it? So from far away shouldn't the mass still be concentrated on a relatively small place and thus the gravity from the recently exploded star should remain unchanged, right? "

Features:   1)Magnification: 18x - 90x  Eyepiece Diameter: 5mm (18x), 10mm (60x)  Objective Diameter: 50mm  Focal Length: 36cm  Tripod Height: 38cm  Main tube Color: Silver  Net Weight: 1.78kg  Case Size: 43cm(L) x 10cm(W) x 26cm(H)  2)Optical Design: Refractor Mount Type: Altazimuth Ideal Usage: Astronomical and land observation Focal Length: 500 mm Aperture: 40 mm Focal Ratio: 13 Highest Useful Magnification: 94x Finderscope: 2 x 20 Lens Coating: Fully coated Light Gathering Power: 33x Limiting Stellar Magnitude: 10.5  3) 2x Barlow Lens and Enhanced Stability The Celestron Powerseeker 40AZ black comes with two extra eyepieces, one which is 20 mm and magnifies up to 25x and the other one is 8 mm which magnifies up to 63x. It also includes a 2x Barlow lens that almost doubles the magnifying capacity.  4)Meade NG60-SM Altazimuth Refractor Telescope Meade's value priced NG60-SM Altazimuth Refractor is an affordable entry level telescope that features an easy to use Altazimuth mount with slow motion controls for precise tracking. The complete package includes a sturdy metal tripod, a red dot viewfinder, two 1.25 inch eyepieces and a star diagonal, and a software DVD with instructional video. The NG60-SM Refractor Telescope comes disassembled in a compact box, but the instructional DVD video guides you through all the steps required for assembly. Go ahead and try it out in the daytime, that's the best time to align the red-dot finder scope while looking at a distant tree or telephone pole. The optics of Meade's NG60-SM produce an image that is right side up but the diagonal mirror reverses the image left-to-right. That's no problem most of the time, but an optional correct image diagonal is available. The low power 25mm eyepiece produces a magnification 28X which is just right for spotting the Moon or the planets, while the 9mm eyepiece (78X magnification) can be used to zoom in for more detail. The MH25 eyepiece at 28X shows a lovely view of the Lunar disk in a dark sky, while the MH9 eyepiece at 78X shows literally hundreds of craters on the Moon and begins to show the rings of Saturn and the cloud bands of Jupiter. For even better views it's easy to add better eyepieces. My best view of Saturn, for example, came with an optional 6.4mm Super Plossl eyepiece, about 110X magnification. The Altazimuth mount included with Meade's NG60-SM is lighter and easier to use than an Equatorial mount, yet the slow motion knobs make it easy to keep objects in view. The rotation of the Earth causes the Moon or planets to appear to drift out of the eyepiece, but the slow motion knobs make it easy to keep the telescope on target, even with a high power eyepiece. The telescope is sensitive to vibration, however, so a high power eyepiece can be difficult to focus.  So which 1 is best?????  I wanna see Saturn its rings,Jupiter and its moons,mars,venus, basically planets and their moons "
529,How to name planets outside our galaxy?,"Recently, planets outside our galaxy have been discovered.  How would be the convention to naming these planets?

530,Current limitations in radio-astronomical spectrometry analysis of local interstellar cloud's hyperfine structures,"I've been trying to wrap my head around capabilities of current radio-astronomical spectrometry technology to isolate not too distant tenuous sources, say, chemical composition and density of the the interstellar medium right in the neighborhood of our Solar system. In essence, what is our local interstellar cloud made out of and how much of it is there:  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  We've had much success so far in isolating distant radio wave sources and analyzing their hyperfine, i.e. molecular level composition. Same goes even for interstellar medium composition down to molecular ions of diazenylium (N2H+) that is surrogate to the presence of unobservable, nonpolar N2.  For example, P. Caselli et al. from the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics presented a paper (PDF) on J = 1 → 0 transition of N2H+ at 93 GHz toward the quiescent low-mass cloud core L1512 in Taurus, back in 1995. That is 18 years ago!  What I don't understand is, what's preventing us, with current technology, from isolating local low-mass formations in the radio wave spectra from its background noise and analyzing its hyperfine structure through radio-astronomical spectrometry? Is the signal to noise ratio simply unworkable and the density of the local cloud too thin to filter it out from its background? Or have such observations actually already been done, and we already have molecular data on the local cloud that I'm not aware of? "
531,Reason for disqualifying Pluto as a Planet?,Pluto is no longer a member of the planets in the solar system.   Why was it disqualified as a planet?  What is the criteria for classifying an Astronomical Object as a Planet? Does this criteria apply to all Star Systems or just our Solar System?  
532,How big are the rocky/icy cores of Jovian planets?,"The size of Earth? Or bigger?

533,How can we tell that the sun is moving with theories such as the theory of relativity?,"In a nutshell, the theory of relativity says that we cannot know that the ether is moving because if we were on the sun, the earth would seem to be moving and visa-versa. Apparently, we can't find absolute motion; we can only find relative motion.   How do we know that indeed the earth moves?  What is relative motion? What is absolute motion?   "
534,Why aren't planet orbits circular?,"Please forgive the simplicity of my question.  I have only had basic science courses.  Common sense seems to indicate that planetary orbits should be very close to circular, any perturbations having been eliminated over the ages.  Could it be that the composition of the planet be influencing the pull of gravity to produce a different gravitational attraction due to its mass?  I mean that if a planet were composed all of one substance, would the planetary orbit be perfectly circular?  I think about earth having constantly shifting water and gasses and even solids that affect its own rotation.  Might these shifts also affect the orbit of the planet around the sun, or does the total mass of the earth and moon together determine the orbit? "

537,Are there expanding-universe cosmological models that do not include inflation?,"I'm happy that the universe is expanding, because we have good scientific evidence in the form of galactic redshift. The Wikipedia Hubble's law article gives what I think is a fair explanation of that. It redirects from cosmological redshift and maybe gives too much emphasis to Doppler shift, but no matter. Because like I said I'm happy that the universe is expanding. Even if there was no evidence, my understanding of general relativity would be telling me that the universe just has to expand. For the life of me, I still don't know why Einstein didn't predict it.     But what I'm not happy about is inflation. I take note of articles like Physicist Slams Cosmic Theory He Helped Conceive where Paul Steinhardt is critical of inflation. He says things like this:     ""The whole point of inflation was to get rid of fine-tuning – to explain features of the original big bang model that must be fine-tuned to match observations. The fact that we had to introduce one fine-tuning to remove another was worrisome. This problem has never been resolved"".    I empathize. I don't empathize with his cyclic universe, but I share his view that we have not explained any feature of the universe by introducing inflation. In fact, I would dispute the claims that inflation explains why the universe is isotropic, homogeneous, flat, and bereft of magnetic monopoles. I'd even say that I think inflation is a solution to a problem that doesn't exist. But as the Wikipedia article says:     ""The basic inflationary paradigm is accepted by most scientists, who believe a number of predictions have been confirmed by observation;   I don't. I'm just some IT guy, but I'm like ""the substantial minority of scientists who dissent from this position"". Steinhardt is mentioned, as are John Earman and Jesus Mosterin. I can read their paper on SciHub. But what I'm struggling to find is any big-bang cosmological model or models that don't feature inflation. It seems to be included in all big bang literature and images, including this ""wine flute"" public domain image courtesy of NASA:    Can anybody point some out to me? In other words my question is this:  Are there expanding-universe cosmological models that do not feature inflation?   "
538,Could dark matter assist with star formation?,"This is related to the question: ""Can dark matter decrease the Jeans length?"" If dark matter assists in any way with star formation, shouldn't it be detectable by precisely measuring velocities in young open clusters?

539,Do massive bolide entries coincide with meteor showers?,"Are exceptionally large, bright, meteors (such as Tunguska or Chelyabinsk) more common during common meteor showers like the Perseids, or the Leonids?   If not, why is that? Do the meteor showers simply not carry any more massive pieces? "
540,How useful are filters for spotting nebulae?,"Recently I've been trying to spot a couple of nebulae, IC59 and IC1318. The skies at the site are modestly dark (4.5 on the Bortle scale), I'm using an 8"" scope, and I've slowly scanned around the areas endlessly with a low magnification/wide angle eyepiece but I haven't been able to find either of them.   Is a filter likely to significantly help in this situation? Would a nebulae filter be more helpful than a light pollution filter? "
541,Why stars are not visible in photos of Planets from space,"The night sky from many parts of the Earth, away from any city lights and pollution, is full of starts, mostly the stars of the Milky Way Galaxy is what fills the night sky densely.  In many photos of outer space capturing the planets of the solar system there is always the black background, not even one single star to be found (I searched for photos of Saturn, Jupiter and even Earth, didn't find any peck of light around it which may be a star)  My question is, why this happens? I've told myself regularly that there can be three reasons for that   The exposure of the camera is too low to capture the stars that might luckily be in the background of a planet's photo. The stars are too spread out each other that in most of the photos there might not even be a star in the dark space behind the planet.  The telescopes taking the photos aren't powerful enough to take the photos of the stars clearly (very much related to the 1st point, but instead of the exposure of the camera I believe it is the telescope that's not capable or maybe made for that)   I have tried looking for answers but didn't find much, maybe if the photo was taken from an angle from where the Milky way galaxy is just right behind the object i.e planet here, we may have seen some twinkling in the background? Or am I wrong?  "
542,Could the big bang have created super massive black holes?,"I understand that space was compressed to a single point and that during the big bang all points within that expanded away from each other at phenomenal speeds. I also have heard that during this the universe wasn't the same everywhere, as in small quantum fluctuations that expanded to macroscopic scales.   Would this mean that higher density than normal areas could create massive black holes? Maybe not as big as the ones today but perhaps large enough to solve some of the problems with super massive black holes being observed in a short amount of time after the big bang  I am not asking ""why didn't the universe turn into a singularity?"" I am asking ""Could the variable density afterwards create many singularities which could explain for the problems associated with super massive blackholes?"". "
543,Does a magnet outside a black hole affect one inside it?,"If I had 2 really strong magnets, and I threw one into a black hole, while holding one outisde it at a safe distance, what would happen? Would the magnets affect each other in any way? Would one push/pull the other? "
544,Celestial impacts,"Have we ever observed, or better yet, recorded, an impact from a comet/meteorite/fragment/etc on another celestial body? For example, in all its time orbiting Mars, has the MRO observed anything impacting the surface?  All the other objects in our solar system that we've observed (aside from gas giants) are either speckled or virtually covered with craters, but I've never heard mention of actually seeing one of these impacts happen. At a basic level I'm curious if we've ever actually directly seen one, but what would be even better is if there's a publicly-available video of it happening. "
545,"Why do ""they"" portray colliding black holes like that?","When I see an animation of two colliding black holes anywhere, it looks like two merging beads of water. But why would the event horizon form a bridge during collision? There is no material flowing in-between. Wouldn't the event horizons ""push"" each-other away as they merge?(the effect not the black hole itself) For what I understand the gravity would poorly, but surely, be canceled out. Wouldn't this ""push"" only disappear from view as they got significantly closer, where it still exists but is trapped in a much larger one?  Just to make sure, as I see the similar questions: I don't mean what happens as they collide, but rather why isn't this portrayed if it does this effect at all? "
546,Can life survive on the equator of cooled and fast rotating white dwarf or neutron star?,"As I know, some stars produces carbon, nitrogen and oxygen when they are old and become white dwarfs or neutron stars. And even their surface gravity is strong, it may rotate very fast so that the surface gravity is diminished, hence materials such as rocks and water can present at the surface normally.  My question is, is it possible for life (eg:bacteria) to survive on the equator of white dwarf or neutron star if it is cooled and rotate very fast? Or is it even possible for the equator of white dwarfs or neutron stars become the origin of life? "
547,Obtain tangent point (origin) of the Standard Coordinates system,"In a previous question (Transform pixel coordinates (in FITS file) to equatorial), Rob supplied a great source that describes the process of obtaining celestial coordinates for objects in an observed field.  The source mentions the tangent point in its description of the Standard Coordinates system:     These are the projection of the RA and DEC of an object onto the tangent plane of the sky, i.e., the plane tangent to the sphere of the sky that intersects the sky at the tangent point (which is usually somewhat offset from the image center). The X coordinate is aligned with RA and the Y coordinate is aligned with DEC. The origin of the standard system is at the tangent point in the image.   I would've assumed that the tangent point (ie: the origin of the standard coordinates system) would be located at the center of the observed field. Apparently this is not correct, hence the questions:   Why is the tangent point usually offset from the image center? (See Edit below) How is the tangent point [tex] obtained?     Edit  I've found the answer to the first question in The Handbook of Astronomical Image Processing, Berry, R. &amp; Burnell, J. (Willmann-Bell, Second Edition 2005).  In Chapter 9 of this book, Astrometry is discussed. Standard coordinates are introduced in page 253 and the effects that disturb the tangent point [tex] are discussed in page 254:     In real life, however, [tex] is inevitably somewhat off the center of the image, and the x and y axes of the detector will be rotated through some angle. (...) In addition to displacement and rotation, the detector might be slightly tilted relative to the incoming light; the manufacturer's figures for the pixel dimensions might be slightly inaccurate at the CCD's operating temperature; and in the case of scanned photographs, the axes may not be perfectly orthogonal and equally scaled.     (Figure 9.2, copyright of the Authors)  However, in page 258 (after explaining how to obtain X,Y from known positions of reference stars in the frame) the authors convert the X,Y coordinates to equatorial coordinates assuming that [tex] are ""now known"".  I might have missed something obvious, but I don't see where these coordinates are obtained in the preceding pages. Question 2 thus, still stands. "
548,Why can't moon light (reflected sun light) turn the sky blue?,Does turning the colour of the sky blue need more luminous light? Does it depend on luminosity or some other factors are also responsible for this phenomenon? Why can't the moon light turn the sky blue even a little bit (at least the area near the disc).  Thanks   
549,How could a neutron star collapse into a black hole?,"White dwarfs usually do not collapse, as they have electron degeneracy pressure due to the Pauli exclusion principle. However, if one accretes mass beyond the Chandrasekhar limit, it is energetically favorable for the electrons to combine with protons and form neutrons. This gives us a neutron star.  However, neutron stars usually do not collapse into black holes due to neutron degeneracy pressure. How is it possible that beyond the LOV limit, the Pauli exclusion principle no longer prevents the collapse? Shouldn't it still prevent neutrons, which are fermions, from being compressed together any further?  I've seen answers involving quark stars, but those are purely hypothetical. What is the most accepted explanation for this? "
550,Exoplanet hunters ignored or ridiculed in the 1980s or 1990s?,"I recently came across this youtube video, in which a few people are singing about the history of exoplanet discovery.  It suggests that, in the 1990s, exoplanet hunters were largely ignored or ridiculed. Is there any truth to this? "
551,Infrared Astronomy for non transiting objects?,"I understand how infrared spectroscopy works for determining molecules in the atmosphere of a transiting object (like Venus from Earth). But how does this work for objects that don't pass between us and the sun? If the IR spectra is an absorption spectra, is the light emitted by a planet, like Uranus, enough for us to determine its atmoshpere's composition via IR spectroscopy? "
552,How does space time differ within a galaxy?,Not the same question but is similar to other marked duplicate.  How much time dilation  does the center of a galaxy can exist and sustain human life from our point of view? What would a day equal to each others point of view looking at each other?  I'm not asking about moving celestial bodies moving from each other but the difference in the gravity wells from the center of our galaxy being generally denser then the edge of a galaxy.      This is another way of asking if I wasn't clear above the line. Not to invalidate any answers.  Point 1 being near the center of the galaxy and point 2 at the the most edge the galaxy. How much would the differences in the galaxies gravity well point 1 being deeper in the center compared to the point 2 the edge effect time?   
553,What is tilt anisoplanatism for Laser-guide-star usage in adaptive optic systems?,How does tip-tilt mirrors correct such issue? What is the physical origin of the error?  
554,3D array in FITS data,"I am an amateur astronomer currently working on Spitzer telescope dataset with python (astropy and aplpy). From the examples in astropy's website, I understood that the FITS data is a way to represent image data with human-readable headers.  However, I now have a fits image ( SPITZER_I2_46469632_0000_0000_2_bcd.fits ) which is a 3D array of dimensions (64, 32, 32). I believe the second and third coordinates to be the length and height of the image in pixels. What about the first dimension? How do I interpret such images and NaNs in the data? "
555,How to mathematically describe a planet's eccentric orbit?,"Is there a formula for describing a planet's position along an eccentric orbit over time? I am particularly interested in the elliptical case (0 &lt; e &lt; 1).  I understand that the planet has a higher velocity closer to the perihelion. Ideally I would like to be able to calculate a planet's position on it's orbital path in relation to how far through it's orbital period it is, if that makes sense.   Alternatively, is there software (that doesn't require a university's budget) to work this out? "
556,Singularity at the time of origins,"According to the big Bang Theory, the universe have started from a point and it describes how the universe expanded from a very high-density and high-temperature state.The initial singularity was a singularity of infinite density thought to have contained all of the mass and space-time of the Universe. If it was so dense,  why didn't it engulf the other parallel universes just like a supermassive black hole?   If there are no other universes,  why the existing black holes didn't suck the entire universe yet?  "
557,Are there any hot jupiters orbiting red dwarfs?,"Do we know of any hot jupiters that could be orbiting a red dwarf (or, more probably, orbiting a barycenter between the two)? Is this scenario even physically possible? "
558,Why is sun's photosphere a million times less dense than air at the surface of the Earth?,"Sun's photosphere is about 19 times as hot as Earth's surface.  (Source: [website]But Solar surface gravity is about 28 times terrestrial surface gravity.  So, shouldn't the density of gases at the photosphere of the sun be comparable to that on the surface of the Earth?  Why is the density of Sun's photosphere a million times lesser?  (Source: [website]Essentially, what I am asking has been aptly worded in userLTK's answer, ""how can the photosphere be so light and almost vacuum like under such high gravity (28 earth gravity)""?  Some of the answers have suggested that this may be because the Sun's photosphere is ionised. This doesn't seem to be accurate. The Hydrogen ionisation at optical depth = 1 is only 0.04%. (Source: [website]"
559,"Open access table of visible stars with magnitude, coordinates, and possibly color?","I'm looking for a link to a table of visible stars that is open and available to everyone. It should have magnitude, RA, dec, and possibly some indication of color. This will be used to produce somewhat realistic night skies as a backdrop for showing the motion of the planets in the sky.  I'm not so interested in names, constellations, etc. These are of course useful to know and possibly to plot, but what I'm primarily after is the information necessary to illustrate star position, brightness, and some color information.  edit: to reiterate, ""...table of visible stars that is open and available to eveyone."" I'm assuming that in 2016 the visible stars are not behind a paywall, am I wrong? Approx RA, dec, mag - are these available for open access and usage? "
560,Thought experiment about our location in the Universe,"[I am sorry if this isn't the best place for this - it was either here or maybe on the Worldbuilding SE.]  I recently re-read one of my favourite childhood sci-fi books (Chocky by John Wyndham), and in it a young boy is asked by an alien being, where in the Universe our planet is.  It occurred to me that this is almost impossible to describe.  Nowadays, with Wikipedia and the Internet, we can get some of the way by stating that we're in a galaxy that is approximately 10 billion years old, light takes approximately 100000 years to cross it, and which is part of a local group, itself part of a cluster, and that part of a super-cluster.  Unfortunately the alien might then ask a follow-up clarification question such as what is a year?  So we go to basics - in base 60 (as opposed to binary or base 10), our basic unit of time is called a second, and there are 60 seconds in a minute, 60 minutes in an hour and 24 hours in a day - which is the time our planet takes to rotate once completely. Our planet orbits a local star (that we call the sun) and each complete orbit takes approximately one year, and light takes around 8 minutes to get from our local star to our planet.  Unfortunately our alien might then ask, but how long is a second? - so we then get into atomic clocks, caesium 133 and phases of radiation, followed by the next inevitable question: what is caesium. So we have to get down to the Periodic Table of the Elements and decribe an atom, atomic weight, and how to define caesium in a way that a far off advance civilization could relate to - not to mention perhaps a tangent about Prime Numbers.  So if our alien was lucky enough to be in contact with someone like Professor Brian Cox, or a physyicist with astronomical leanings, how would such a description and conversation go? "
561,Is Optical VLBI theoretically feasible? If not why not?,"There are plenty of optical interferometers in use with baselines of up to maybe 1km. As far as I can find out, they all work by directly collecting the light at all the telescopes, using mirrors to bring them together and then actually interfering them and observing the fringes with photodetectors.   Meanwhile, radio astronomers do interferometry over distances of thousands of km, but they do it quite differently. Essentially, they record the baseband electromagnetic waveform at each telescope, with an accurate timestamp, transport them all to a central location and combine them computationally.   So my question is whether in principle you could use the radio astronomers methods with an optical (or near IR) signal. Obviously the engineering and computational challenges would be formidable -- you would need to record data at speeds close to 1 Pb/s, timestamp it with femtosecond accuracy and do a ludicrously huge computation to recover an image, but that's not my question here.  On the one hand, it seems like the answer should be ""yes"" -- electromagnetic waves are electromagnetic waves. On the other hand, why should the phase of a photon observed in one telescope have anything to do with the phase of one observed in another? If you are digitising the data at each telescope, you are ruling out interference  fringes on a quantum level, just as happens if you find a way to measure which slit a photon went through in the double-slit interferometer. This suggests that the answer should be ""no"".  If the answer is ""no"" then what wavelength does the cutoff happen at? We have radio-style VLBI at 1mm now and optical-style interferometry at 1 [tex], what is possible in between? "
562,Sidereal time and right ascension,"I'm new to astronomy and have to make a star map that displays the stars above a current location. From the information I've pieced together I understand that declination is equal to the current latitude of the observer, however I am slightly confused about right ascension. My two quesions are;   If I work out GMST using the equations here; [website]If I want to find the sidereal time of, for example, Sydney, Australia, do I need to account for daylight savings at either location or do I simply add 11 hours to GMST?   Thank you for your help. "
563,Can hot Jupiters cause solar flares?,"I'm very new at Astronomy, and my knowledge is sparse. I've tried to be conscientious about my Wikipedia research but there's going to be a lot of things I don't know. Thanks for your patience.    BACKGROUND  I had read that hot Jupiters can cause superflares due to magnetic recombination. But checking Wikipedia I came across the following:     Not all planetary transits can be detected by Kepler, since the planetary > orbit may be out of the line of sight to Earth. However, the hot Jupiters > orbit so close to the primary that the chance of a transit is about 10%. > If superflares were caused by close planets the 279 flare stars    discovered should have about 28 transiting companions; none of them    actually showed evidence of transits, effectively excluding this    explanation.   - Wikipedia    QUESTION  Given this, and among modern astronomers in general, is the theory that hot Jupiters can cause superflares on the outs? Or is the article just saying that hot Jupiters can't explain these particular stars, while the model remains valid elsewhere? Do we have any solid evidence of a gas giant causing solar flares, super or otherwise? "
564,Farthest Orbit around the Earth?,What is the farthest orbit that can be achieved around the Earth? How fast is that?    Not the question below: Feel free to answer in a comment  I ask because of this question: [website]Is there an orbit exist where 2 objects going in opposite directions can intersect repeatedly with minor course corrections?  
565,Home telescope for viewing 2017 VR12,"News has come up lately about the impending approach of asteroid 2017 VR12 and how it might be visible to some backyard telescopes. However I've read conflicting or vague reports on what kinds of telescopes will be powerful enough to spot it.  I've got a modest but still decent little Celestron NexStar 4 SE, which is a 4"" Schmidt-Cassegrain. Can anyone say for sure whether that has the power to see the asteroid? Currently I just have the stock eyepiece. Would I need to get a better one to help out? "
566,How can an amateur astronomer verify the position of near Earth objects?,"Sometimes, hobby-astronomers use rather professional means to observe the big voids of space. Every now and then (think in months, not days) even I can locate an NEO (near Earth object).  Now, I'm assuming governments and institutions worldwide track such NEOs, have the best options to observe them, and most probably accumulated more data than we could wish for.  For hobby-astronomers who spot an NEO, it could be of interest to verify the location of the spotted NEO, and maybe even learn more about a specific NEO from additional data like name, type, path, direction, speed, first observed, etc.  Is there any publicly available, NEO-related database out there? Or is there a specific institution a hobby-astronomer can/should turn to to be able to learn more about individual NEOs? "
567,Can weak gravitational lensing or microlensing-induced wavefront distortion limit resolution of absurdly large aperture telescopes?,"This is a theoretical question.   This answer to the question If we had the right technology could we see a distant star in detail? (presumably space-based) primarily addresses the scaling of diffraction-limited resolution with aperture [tex]. For existing and near-future telescopes this is assumed to follow [tex].  Imagine a future optical or radio interferometric telescope of absurdly large effective aperture or baseline, say AU or even larger, operated similarly to the Event Horizon Telescope (local downconversion and timestamping, interferometry performed offline)  Could weak gravitational lensing effects or gravitational microlensing result in wavefront distortion that if not corrected, would result in degraded resolution? Note I'm not asking about distortion of the field, but instead a limitation to the resolution; degraded point spread function.  If so, would this problem be amenable to correction in the same way that atmospheric and ionospheric effects (visible and radio) are dealt with? Would it generally be static on the timescale of the observation? "
568,Are planets more likely to have dense materials at their cores?,"When planets are forming, does the densest material sink the core and the less dense material ""float"" on top? What I'm asking is that are the more dense materials more likely to appear in the core rather than the surface. I'm also wondering, can a planet have an iron surface and still have rock beneath the surface in its crust and core? "
569,Logarithmic scale for large distances?,"I understand this is an icky subject, but I recently got interested in units for large distances for applications in cosmology and what not (after hearing about the redefinition of the kilo and kelvin), and I was surprised to see many very weird units which seem difficult to use.  So I was thinking in astronomy distances only get larger and larger, so I looked to see if I could find any logarithmic scale for distances and I couldn't find any. Then again, I'm not an astronomer and not suited to argue anything.  Are there any logarithmic scales for larger distances, and if so why aren't they being used? And if non exist, is there a reason why(is it simply a bad idea)? Or is it simply a matter of keeping historical background? "
570,Problem about finding distance with magnitude given,"A star in Pleiades cluster has apparent magnitude of +12 ([tex]) determine it's distance from the sun? (We know the Sun properties such apparent and absolute magnitudes, distance from earth, luminosity, brightness (energy flux) and others but nothing is given about the other star expect that apparent magnitude).  My problem is that we don't have luminosity of the star. We can say:  [tex]  As we can see, we don't have luminosity of the star. Can this question be solved with this information? "
571,Does the Milky Way's movement through space have spacetime implications?,"The way I usually see spacetime explained, it says that if you just sit still, you are moving at 0kph and so you are moving at maximum speed through time (ie. time for you is flowing at maximum speed).  However, sitting still we're moving at the speed of our galaxy through space, which is about 600km/s.  The speed of light is about 300,000km/s.  So for simplicity's sake, let's say the galaxy is actually moving through space at 1,000km/s.  Does this in fact mean that if I sit still on Earth, time for me is actually flowing 1/300th slower than if I were sitting still with respect to the universe?  And does it also mean that if the Milky Way were travelling at 99% the speed of light, time for me would be flowing at 1% the rate of the flow of time for someone that was sitting still with respect to the universe? "
572,Do today's professional astronomers use earth rotation angle or sidereal time?,"I have read that ""earth rotation angle"" is the modern replacement for ""Greenwich sidereal time"". Is it actually the case that modern professional astronomers are using earth rotation angle? Either way, what is the reason for using the one they use? "
573,What is the standard reference point for measuring speed?,"Speed, as we know, doesn't exist without first having a reference point. We then say that the reference point isn't moving at all, and speed is then measured in relation to the reference point.  What is the standard reference point when determining the speed of objects in astronomy? Earth? "
574,Why do nebulae turn into accretion disks but planets do not?,"What are the factors that prevent planets from also turning into disks, like the stellar dust in a nebula does?  The Earth is not a perfect sphere, but rather it's squished at the poles and it bulges at the Equator, owing to its rotation working to squish it into a disk.  I'm tempted to say that the Earth couldn't become a disk because of the density of the material in it fighting back against being pressured into a disk in a way that in stellar gas you can't? But then, why isn't the gas around the gas giants a disk? Is it because of the solid nucleus of those planets fighting against that? "
575,Could a contracting Universe create the redshift effect observed by Hubble?,"What if we just can’t see far enough and the redshift actually shows the galaxies speeding up towards a gigantic black hole to where everything is converging, repeating a cycle that took place countless times “before” the big bang?  Complete text in this link: [website]Even in a contracting Universe, there is a region around the observer where all the galaxies are moving away; the galaxies that are moving towards the observer could be too far to be seen. If we can demonstrate this, we could challenge the conclusion that the Universe is expanding, based on the redshift effect observed in the “nearby” galaxies.    Let’s start with a simpler representation: 1 dimension only (1D). Assume that all the galaxies move along a single line. We could represent an expanding and a contracting Universe as per the images below:    In Situation 1, we have the currently accepted model, where galaxies move away from each other, at increasing speed, which creates the redshift observed by Hubble.  In Situation 2, we assume that in the contracting Universe the galaxies have a speed that is inversely proportional to the distance from the center (as in a sink flow where the particles accelerate towards the drain), galaxies 1 and 3 will display a red shift effect, because they are moving away from each other, while galaxies 4, 5 and 6 will appear with blueshift effect. However, in order to see the blue shifted galaxies it is necessary to see beyond the center of the Universe, which would be not possible either because of the distance or because of the gigantic black hole in the center traps light from galaxies 4, 5 and 6 preventing it from reaching us at galaxy 2.  In fact, assuming that from galaxy 2 we cannot see beyond galaxy 1, it is impossible to distinguish between situation 1 and 2. With this we have demonstrated that for a 1D Universe it is impossible to determine if it is expanding or contracting, simple because we cannot see far enough. What about a 2D space?  Consider two galaxies (1 and 2); consider that they form a angle beta, relative to the center of the universe (assuming that there is one); Consider that galaxy 1 is at the distance r from the center; consider that galaxy 2 is at a fraction of r (say xr) from the center.  We can calculate the distance between galaxy 1 and 2 as follows:    From the equation above we can calculate alfa and from  we can calculate d.  We also suppose that the speed along the radius can be calculated with the equation v = c / r, where c is constant.  Therefore we can calculate the position of the two galaxies after a period of time t, and measure the distance d between them to verify if d increases (redshift) of decreases (blueshift).  We can see that no matter what the fraction x is, there is always a minimum value for the angle beta, such that any galaxy within this angle will be moving away from the reference galaxy. Now assume that the universe is so big that we cannot see galaxies beyond beta. In this way, all that we can see is redshifted galaxies!  This means that even for a contracting universe, depending on how far we can see, it is possible to detect only redshifted galaxies. Does not this disprove the theory of expanding universe based on redshift? "
576,From where so much of energy would have arrived as was required for such a giant universe to have come into existence?,If we convert the mass of all the stars and all the planets which must be weighing trillions and trillions of tonnes by the equation E = m.c^2 it gets converted into an unimaginable amount of energy. Would so much of energy not have gone into the evolution of the Universe? I am at a great suspense whether the Big Bang theory or any other theory at all answers from where so much of energy would have come that would have got converted into so many trillions and trillions of tonnes of the mass of all the galaxies put together. How we can believe in the big-bang-theory unless we know from where so much of energy would have arrived?

An open access epdf is linked in the Washington Post article if you click from inside it: A self-taught astronomer spotted something no scientist had ever seen which is a good read itself.     His discovery, reported Wednesday in the journal Nature, is a landmark for astronomy. Buso’s images are the first to capture the brief “shock breakout” phase of a supernova, when a wave of energy rolls from a star’s core to its exterior just before the star explodes.

579,How might WFIRST help us better understand dark energy?,"In the video linked in the Space.com article What Would It Mean for Astronomers If the WFIRST Space Telescope Is Killed?, (available in YouTube as WFIRST: The Best of Both Worlds) after 02:00 Caltech cosmologist Yun Wang says:     WFIRST will allow us to potentially make ground-breaking discoveries, finding out what dark energy is. So this will tell us if dark energy is an unknown form of energy, or if its a modification of general relativity.   Without going too deep in to GR, how might that happen?   Question: What kinds of WFIRST observations  and interpretations would be used to potentially address the nature of dark energy?   Based on comments, I'll reclassify the following as an afterthought:  Is this in any way related to news about a recent observational non-exclusion of Erik Verlinde's theories (the guy who's ""Trying to kill dark matter""), discussed in Margot Brouwer's 2016 video Verlindes new theory first tested with weak gravitational lensing about the VLT Survey Telescope kilo-degree survey results (see also Cosmos Magazine's New theory of ‘dark gravity’ passes first test, but Einstein’s still on top, or am I mixing apples and oranges?

581,Why is the opening in the Anglo-Australian Telescope's dome so small?,"Many older or ""classic"" telescope domes have a horizon-to-zenith opening in the dome, and this helps speed up the thermal equilibration between the inside and outside air, decreasing turbulence and its effects upon resolution.    Source    Source  But the Anglo-Australian Telescope has second mechanism that tightly constrains the vertical extent of the opening as well, leaving just a tiny hole barely big enough for the telescope to see the sky.

582,Are the radial spokes in Saturn's rings reliably visible via ground-based telescopes,"In the mid 1970's, Franklin and O'Meara saw persistent ""radial spoke-like features"" in the rings of Saturn, that should not have existed due to the differential rotation of the rings.  A publication on this observation was rejected by a journal apparently on the grounds that the phenomenon was considered to be illusory (c.f Sciparelli/Lowell's Martian canals?).           From ""Seeing in the Dark: How   Amateur Astronomers Are Discovering the Wonder"" By Timothy Ferris.   My question is, how reliably were these features visible from the ground-based telescopes of the day?  Could sufficiently strong evidence for the existence been obtained before images from space probes?  Was the rejection of the paper reasonable in the historical context in which the paper was submitted? "
583,How can tidal heating lower Io's orbit?,"This answer to the question Is Io a magic energy machine? suggests that the energy from the internal heating of Io due to tidal ""squishing"" as it moves cyclically closer and farther from Jupiter in its elliptical orbit will come from the energy of Io's orbit. A lower energy orbit is necessarily smaller, and that actually means that the velocity will be larger. (When you want to raise a satellite's orbit to a higher altitude, you actually use thrust in the direction of motion to slow it down.)  Given that tidal forces are a little complicated (cf. Why is the Moon receding from the Earth due to tides? Is this typical for other moons?), is it a priori certain that the heating will lower Io's orbit, causing it to speed up? (Consider that Earth's Moon's receding is due in part to Earth's liquid ocean, and Jupiter is a gas giant.) Is it just the perijove that will decrease, or the semi-major axis?   How can a (seemingly, naively, on average) radial force cause a tangential acceleration? Io is tidally locked to Jupiter so its rotation around its own axis is synchronous to its rotation around Jupiter.  edit: fwiw if the gravitational interactions between Io and Jupiter's other moons causes the problem to be too complex to answer easily, I'm more interested in the basic dynamics of tidal heating and effects on the orbit of a single moon, rather than specifically Io's situation.

585,Is the structure of crystalized white dwarf related to nuclear pasta?,"There is news of an analysis of a large number of nearby white dwarfs revealing a ""pile-up"" at a certain point in their cooling which has been predicted to happen due to a phase change where nuclear material crystalizes. This is analogous to a mixture of ice and water remaining at 0C while it is in the process of freezing (or thawing).  What is this crystalline material like? Is it really a lattice of Carbon and Oxygen nuclei in some recognizable structure (cubic BCC... etc.)? Is it related in some way to nuclear pasta?  Nature: Core crystallization and pile-up in the cooling sequence of evolving white dwarfs "
586,Determining effect of small variable force on planetary perihelion precession,"Is there an analytical technique for determining the effect of a small variable transverse acceleration upon the rate of aspides precession (strictly not a precession but rotation of the line of aspides) of a planet orbitting around the Sun in a 2D plane according to Newtonian gravity law?    I have modelled such effects in a reiterative computer model and would like to verify those measurements.    The transverse acceleration formula is      [tex]   Where:-     c is speed of light,       K is a constant of magnitude between 0 and +/-3, such that [tex].       Ar is the acceleration of the planet towards the Sun due to Newtonian gravitational influence of the Sun, ([tex]).      Vr is radial component of planet velocity relative to the Sun (+ = motion away from the Sun)      Vt is transverse  component of planet velocity relative to the Sun (+ = direction of planet forward motion along its orbital path). Vectorially Vt = V - Vr where V is the total instantaneous velocity vector of the planet relative to the Sun.       Assume planet mass is small relative to the Sun      No other bodies are in the system      All motions and accelerations are confined to the two-dimensional plane of the orbit.   UPDATE  The reason why this is interesting to me is that a value of K = +3 in my computer model produces anomalous (Non-Newtonian) periapse rotation rate values very close within about 1% of those predicted by General Relativity and within a few percent of those observed by astronomers (Le Verrier, updated by Newcomb).  Formula (Einstein, 1915) for GR-derived periapse rotation (radians per orbit) from [website]$$ \boldsymbol{\omega}=24.\pi^3.a^2.T^{-2}.c^{-2}.(1-e^2)^{-1} $$  UPDATE 4  I have accepted Walter's answer.  Not only did he answer the original question (Is there a technique...?) but also his analysis produces a formula which not only confirms the computer-simulated effects of the transverse acceleration formula (for K = 3) but which also (unexpectedly to me) is essentially equivalent to the Einstein 1915 formula.  from Walter's Summary (in Walter's answer below):-  : (from first order peturbation analysis) semi-major axis and eccentricity are unchanged, but the direction of periapse rotates in the plane of the orbit at rate [tex] where [tex] is the orbital frequency and [tex] with [tex] the semi-major axis. Note that (for [tex]) this agrees with the general relativity (GR) precession rate at order [tex] (given by Einstein 1915). "

588,How to get ephemeris data for location?,How can I obtain ephemeris data which fits to a specific location? Differently phrased: I need ephemeris data of satellites which orbited a specific location. Is there a document where I can look up references?  Right now I am looking in ftp://cddis.gsfc.nasa.gov/gnss/data/daily/2019/ but the subfolders only contain weirdly named broadcast files which don't make much sense to me.   The reason I need these ephemeris files is that I want to test gps-sdr-sim with a USRP I got. I know that those ephemeris broadcast files contain data to every other satellite in orbit (but not in the same file as I understand).   I tried multiple ephemeris files with gps-sdr-sim but none of the data transmitted worked for the location I am in.  Any help would be appreciated.

590,What is the Northernmost Latitude of Saturn?,"My wife and I were watching a TV show last night, which takes place in Salem, Massachusetts circa 1693.  One character went to a particular place in the woods at a particular time to be exactly under Saturn.  I told my wife that Saturn could never be exactly above such a Northern latitude.  What is the Northernmost Latitude that Saturn could possibly be above?  By ""above"", I mean if you draw a line through the center of the Earth and through Saturn, the point on the Earth's surface that line passes through.  Also, how often would it reach that point?  Would it be every few years, or every few thousand years? "

592,How exactly is our universe mapped?,"Watching this youtube video shows that our planet is nothing more than dust in the wind.  At the 2:50 mark in the video, you will see a view of the whole Milky Way. At the bottom you will see this text   Light travel time from earth: 100,000 years  Which means if we travel at light speed we need 100,000 years to go far from the Milky Way.  If nothing can travel faster than light, and if it takes 100,000 years to go far from the Milky Way at light speed   How did they map our whole universe, which has a radius of 13.798±0.037 billion light years?    "
593,How tightly clustered are the CHIME-detected FRB repeats?,"In the past few days, journalists have been playing the usual ""X could be aliens"" game. This time, X is repeating FRBs from a galaxy 1.5 billion light years away. (Or is it 1.5 billion years ago? The proper/conformal time distinction isn't clear in pop sci.) I couldn't find the galaxy's name anywhere, but then I suppose a galaxy that distant might not have been named, even if it's now of some interest. Still, the claim of ""repeated"" bursts (regardless of their cause) made me wonder: what is our tightest empirical upper bound on how far apart the detected bursts' sources are?  I'm prepared to believe we can see 1.5 billion light years away, clearly enough to pin two events to the same 100,000-light-year wide galaxy, with no others within 2 million light years of it (these are plausible example numbers based on comparing the Milky way to Andromeda). They're small fractions of 1.5 billion light years, but not so small we couldn't resolve an image that clearly. On the other hand, I sincerely doubt we can prove any two bursts that distant are from the same star. I presume what's notable about repeat FRBs is they're so close together in time we expect the source to be common, but I'm curious as to how tightly observations constrain that. "
594,Lack of planets in the Oort Cloud,"With the current news about the possibility of a planet in the Oort cloud, I was thinking, why is the matter in the Oort cloud distributed so? It makes sense that inside the planet region there is not a huge concentration of comets and meteors, but why is the matter inside the cloud itself not agglomerating? It seems like there is enough matter to form not one or two, but many more planets. "

596,Difference in creation of solar flares and CME?,"What is the difference in the creation process of solar flares and CME (coronal mass ejections)? How do they relate to sunspots and coronal holes?   Here there are some good explanations about the flares' and CME's differences. But my question focuses on how each of them is created, and what are the respective conditions at the corona.   Edit: In an effort to make the questions more clear, I could add that as far as I can tell both effects result from magnetic reconnection, but in one case we have only energetic particles emitted while in the other we have whole chunks of plasma. Do we know which is the determining factor about which of the two will happen?   Also, I understand that flares are mostly related to sunspots while ejections are to coronal holes. Is this correct? If yes then it sounds like a pretty big difference.   (Please be reminded that specifying that the answer is not known yet is an answer.)   Edit #2: Please see this comment for further clarification of what the question is about.  "
597,What were the challenges for the ancients to observe the orbit of the Moon (instead of Mars)?,"Astrophysics can be said to have been founded by Johannes Kepler around the year 1600. He based his break-through science on data of the position of Mars in the sky and disproved the ancient ideas about circular orbits and epicycles.  But why wasn't this done far earlier, by using observations of the Moon? Wasn't it pretty obvious to a careful astrologer a thousand years ago, that the Moon does not have a circular orbit and does not describe epi-cycles? It is the easiest celestial object to observe, visible both night and day. Moon calendars may have been designed tens of thousands of years ago, there's no lack of observational data. Kepler instead used a few oppositions of Mars which take place only once every two+ years. Since the Moon is the one object which does orbit Earth, in a geocentric world view it should've been the perfect test of circular and epi-cyclical theories about its orbit. Its nearness causes a daily parallax between moonrise and moonset, but that wouldn't be beyond a genius like Kepler or many mathematical astrologers before him.  What made the orbit of the Moon difficult for the ancients to understand? "

Looking at the crude drawing on this NASA page shows only a Cassegrain-like geometry, but there must be additional goodies to obtain a similar resolution with a 10x wider field. Does it have three, four, or five mirrors like the E-ELT or the LSST (cf. What is a quaternary mirror and why does the E-ELT need one? and answers therein) or corrector lenses? What is the magic sauce that makes this possible, and is there at least a schematic diagram of the optics somewhere?    above: From NASA. "
602,Time-frame regarding cosmic expansion and the bound state of the Virgo Cluster,"Due to accelerating cosmic inflation, other galaxies and galaxy clusters will eventually race toward the Hubble horizon apparently away from us, placing them effectively out of our sphere of influence. Due to Virgocentric flow, nearby galaxies, including our own, may become gravitationally bound to the Virgo Supercluster, resisting cosmic expansion (for at least some time).  My question is, Is there any hypothetical time-frame for when this event happens? That is, in what supposed number of billions or trillions of years will the Virgo Supercluster become the only region within the Hubble sphere with which we may interact with?  Edit: Is such an estimate currently impossible? I know I've read one in the past, I just don't remember it well. Somewhen in the ballpark of a trillion years. All I'm looking for is an educated guess. "

604,Inflation cosmology: slow-roll inflation versus tunneling between two vacua,"In slow-roll inflation models, the early inflation of the universe is driven by the flat non-zero part of the inflaton potential, and it ends as the ball rolls down the cliff and the potential energy released leads then to the formation of matter.    However, as I have heard such slow-roll models are no longer deemed realistic today in inflationary cosmology, instead other models where the end of the inflation is explained by quantum tunneling of the universe from a state with higher vacuum energy density to another state with lower vacuum energy density are considered for example.    Why (from a physical point of view) are slow-roll inflation models no longer considered to be realistic, what are their disadvantages? What can models that explain (the end of) the early inflation by a tunneling transition between to vacua explain or describe, that slow roll models can not do? "

606,"Can gravity cause a Big Crunch, if the cosmological principle holds?","Say we have a closed universe that follows the cosmological principle. As a result, mass is distributed equally and, if as far as I know, gravity should have no net effect on the movements of galaxies (as in, there are no peculiar velocities).  However, in the Big Crunch, the Universe stops expanding and gravity causes the scale factor to decrease. How is this possible? Shouldn't gravity have no effect on a homogenous and isotropic universe?  On that note, if gravity actually caused a collapse, would gravity cause the comoving coordinates of the galaxies to change?

619,"How do tadpole, horseshoe co-orbital states arise and how are they stable?","A recent paper in Nature ""Planetary science: Reckless orbiting in the Solar System"" (Morais &amp; Namouni, 2017) presents the following series of four co-orbital states:    While I understand the development of the quasi-satellite and trisectrix states, I am unable to inuit the development of the tadpole and horseshoe co-orbital states.  From explanation provided in the article:     The tadpole and horseshoe shapes arise because the planet's   gravitational attraction alters the body's orbital path — the body   goes through a cycle of catching up with the planet and falling   behind, seeming to change direction from the perspective of the   planet.   How, when approaching the planet, does the body ""fall behind"" instead of continuing to accelerate toward the planet?  The only means that comes to mind is if the planet orbits faster than the body, but then I imagine it would   No longer be considered co-orbital (because it would have a different orbital period), and Would eventually be overtaken by the planet.   How, then, do these first two co-orbital states work?  Citation: Nature 543, 635–636 (30 March 2017) doi:10.1038/543635a "

625,"In planetary and astronomical science, what exactly is, or is not, a tidal force?","I'm wondering exactly in which situations forces between bodies are, and are not consider to be tidal forces in the context of planetary and astronomical science.  If two rigid, non-deformable spherical masses with shperically symmetric mass distributions orbit each other,  can we say there are no tidal forces or tidal effects there?  If one of them has a permanent, static deformation (e.g. quadrupole moments and higher) are there tidal forces then? If both do?  Or are dynamic, induced deformations required before we invoke the ""T-word""?  Can tidal forces be radial, such that they do not tend to raise or lower an orbit over time, or must they have tangential components, like the one that is slowly raising the Moon's orbit?

626,preserve information in a black hole,How is information preserved on the surface of a black hole? Is there an compression algorithm for storing the information?    What if there is a uniformaly complex object dropped to the black hole? Then there will be no compression of information. How is there enough space on the surface (2D) to encode something which is in 3D. The planck distance is the same in the black hole as in the universe. So how can the black hole encode information about an object in 3D that is both uniformly complex and as dense as the black hole? Or is there a law that says 3D objects cannot be more dense then some level - which is sufficiently sparse so that when collapsed to a black hole all its information can be encoded on the surface of a sphere?

629,What is the direction of the movement of the solar system in relation to the galaxy's plane,"I got from this answer that the axis of the solar system is tilted of about 63 degrees in relation to that of our galaxy, so I can assume that we move through space (at least locally) roughly in a direction that is 63° tilted in relation to our solar system's plane, is that correct?  If so, then: is there also some net velocity of our solar system (probably small) in a direction that is perpendicular to the galaxy's plane, as opposed to the main direction that is ""parallel"" to the galaxy's plane?  Thank you in advance.    EDIT  I think my question is different from this one in that the latter asks about the distance from the solar system to the galactic plane, with no regards as to the speed with which this distance is changing. On the other hand, I'm interested not on the distance, but on the speed with which this distance is changing, which can promptly be approximated with respect to time with a sine function from pela's answer, which was my main intention.

632,Is all of the data from the same program that found the Wow!-signal analyzed?,"I just read on Wikipedia that...     By 1977, Ehman was working at the SETI project as a volunteer; his job involved analyzing by hand large amounts of data processed by an IBM 1130 computer and recorded on line printer paper.    Emphasis mine.  From what I understand, the program had been running for four years before this happened, (1973–1995), and considering the amount of data that must have been generated and how bad humans are at doing boring repetitive tasks, it seems to me that the risk is very high that a similar event was overlooked. Here is a small example of the type of printouts he was looking at:    You can easily imagine a stream of 5IJSI in one of the 50 columns looking the same as 21121 to a tired human operator.  So I have two related questions:   Was manual human inspection the only analysis done on the data during the seventies, or did he just do it out of interest? Was the program set up to alert on any ""suspicious"" signals, for example anything above a certain threshold for at least two samples? Is all data digitally preserved? I assume that by the eighties, everything became trivial to store, but I'm not so sure everything was stored in the seventies when they just started. If the data is preserved, has further automated analysis been done on the data set before and after the Wow!-event to rule out anything similar?  "

For example, Maps of Time says,     Many of the ingredients of the early atmosphere (including much of its water), together with many of the organic chemicals that formed the first life forms, may have been brought to Earth by the comets that bombarded its surface for the first billion years of its life (~Kindle location 1922).   Why the presumption that these materials must be brought by comets? Did Earth even have the right atoms to make water and those organic chemicals (hydrogen, oxygen, carbon)? And what are comets doing with heavier elements in the first place? My understanding is that comets are (for most of their lives) very far from the run, and my impression was most of the elements other than hydrogen and helium and are concentrated close to the sun, with T Tauri Wind having push hydrogen and helium further away. "
634,Appearance of sun at geologic past,"After origin of Earth ( 4.54 billion years ago ) to today; what are the changes  through-which the sun undergone with time? , ( if seen from Earth. )  I'm doing some palaeobiology-landscape rendering; so I'm thinking if I want to add the sun in such pictures; should I draw it just like present day? Or the look/ appearance (colour, size, flames, position, halo etc) varied in observable amount through the geologic time-scale(precambrian-cambrian-ordovician-silurian-devonian-carboniferous-permian-triassic-jurassic-cretaceous-palaeogene-neogene etc). (the timescale terms provided just to hint the answerer the level of details may NOT to go )  Update: Here I attach a  small version of geologic time table to indicate time ranges.      from here .

635,Can radioactive decay rates be confirmed by looking at supernova?,"Radiometric dating relies on accurate knowledge of the half-lives of radioactive elements. Skeptics have argued that since many elements' half-lives are too long for anyone to have observed them, we can't know what they were in the distant past.  There are various counterarguments based on terrestrial evidence, like agreement between elements in the same sample, and corroboration from varves, tree rings, and ice layers.  Another counterargument I've seen is by looking at supernova, we get a window ""back in time"" to when their light began its long journey to us, and that much of this light was generated by radioactive decay, confirming that decay rates were the same then as now.  I don't quite follow this explanation, and would like some help. Distant starlight doesn't give us a rock sample in which to analyze proportions of parent and daughter elements. Does it still somehow give evidence of specific radioactive decay rates? If so, how?  I know next to nothing about astronomy, so please explain this to me like I'm a child. "
636,Is there a threshold on distance/size for a tidal locking?,"I know that some systems tend to tidal locking (such as earth-moon), which occurs basically because the difference in the gravitational pull on one side is significantly different from the pull on the opposite side. (There's a lot of great answers here.) But what can be considered a significant different? In other words, is there a threshold on distance or size in order for systems to tend to tidal lock?  Thanks! "
637,Blood Moon Identification in NASA reports,"Often I look at NASA's Eclipse Web Site. More specifically, I often look at the Index to Five Millennium Catalog of Lunar Eclipse. How can I tell if an eclipse results in a ""blood moon""? I know not all lunar eclipses result in a blood moon, but I do know that some do. So how can I know if one is from looking at it? A blood moon is the phenomenon whereby the moon in total eclipse appears reddish in color as it is illuminated by sunlight filtered and refracted by the earth's atmosphere. (Google)  Edit:  James K says this question may be a duplicate of another question. I want to know how to identify ""blood moons"" from looking at NASA's reports. The other question is more general. However the answer may be the same. "
638,Age of the universe,We know that the universe is approximately 13.7 billion years old. What methods did we use to discover this? How sure are we about its accuracy? 
639,Calculation of Eccentricity of orbit from velocity and radius,"For a school project I am making a gravitational computer model. As I want to Milankovitch cycles, I need to calculate the eccentricity of an orbit after the model has completed its simulation.  I have thought about calculating the eccentricity using the aphelion and parohelion height, but these are not available as it is a simulation and as it therefore stores the data for one point on the ellipse.  The data I have after the model has completed: X,Y,Z coordinates of points that it has saved X,Y,Z velocities of points that it has saved    I have been able to calculate the semi-major axis using the vis-viva equation. I have tried to get the value using the vis-viva equation but I got stuck as I think I need at least the Aphelion or Parohelion to calculate the eccentricity.  My question: Does anyone know how  to calculate the eccentricity at any given point in the orbit using the velocity and coordinates (without simulating all points around it)?   If not, does anyone maybe have a better idea/suggestion that I can try to gain the eccentricity values? "
640,In what timeframe is W26 expected to go supernova?,"All the news-articles say that it is expected to ""eventually"" explode. Which doesn't really tell me much. When is ""eventually""? Also, considering this is the largest star in the known universe and 16k light-years away, will this be visible? Will it be dangerous? "

642,When will we be able to detect Earth-sized exoplanets?,"I have heard that the only planets able to be seen outside the Solar system are Jovian-sized planets with the occasional detection of planets three times the Earth's size. But, as far as I know, we haven't seen any Earth-sized (due to the range of our telescopes?) extrasolar planets. When will we be able to detect them? "
643,How Does a Refractor Telescope Work?,"As I understand it, the difference between a reflector and a refractor is that a reflector uses mirrors on the back to reflect the light to the secondary mirror then the secondary mirror reflects the light to your eye focusing the image with each reflection. How then does a refractor use a lens to sharpen the image? Does it just sharpen the image and shoot it to the prism at the back, and into your eye? "
644,How can you determine the initial volume of a planet's atmosphere?,Since the surface pressure of a planet is determined by the mass of the column of gasses above it one would surmise that to determine the pressure you must know the volume and mass of the atmosphere.  Knowing the composition and volume of the gasses in the atmosphere would allow you to calculate their mass but how do we determine what that volume is?  Assuming we are only concerned with initial conditions when the primary atmosphere (created through accretion) was formed would the volume be arbitrary?  I hope this isn't too broad of a question. I'm trying to pin down a possible initial state that would be created when a new planet is formed and the conditions stabilize. 
645,Timescale of ignition of a protostar?,"What is the timescale of start of nuclear fusion as T Tauri type star transforms into a Main Sequence star?  Wikipedia article on T Tauri type stars mentions:     Their central temperatures are too low for hydrogen fusion. Instead, they are powered by gravitational energy released as the stars contract, while moving towards the main sequence, which they reach after about 100 million years.   The mentioned 100 million years is the period of the star being in its stable (well, as stable as the turbulent T Tauri type stars get) state without nuclear fusion. Then, once the fusion starts, we get between 3 million and hundreds of billions years of main sequence, depending on mass of the resulting star.  What I'm interested is how long is the period of transition between the two - ignition of the nuclear reaction - time between ""all energy produced by gravitational contraction"" and ""most of energy produced by nuclear fusion"".  I imagine this period could be quite short, and the effect quite rapid and turbulent as the initial fusion increases local temperature (and as result pressure) drastically, leading to conditions conductive for fusion spreading rapidly over the volume which is already on brink of entering the fusion everywhere within the protostar, essentially a nuclear wildfire encompassing the gathered gas, a chain reaction starting.  Am I right in my guess this process is rather rapid? Was it ever observed? Or contrary, does the intensity of the fusion reaction rise gradually and slowly from zero over many millions years of star formation?  "
646,How does interstellar matter density vary?,"Answer to my question partially answers this one, about density of intergalactic matter and matter within galaxy:     But it is mostly a hot, ionized void. How void? The density of the intergalactic medium is about 1 to 100 particles per cubic meter (you can compare it to the mean galactic density, of about a million particles per cubic meter, or that of Earth's atmosphere, of about 10^26 particles cubic meter). How hot? It can go from 10^5 to 10^7 K.   If we skip the most dense concentrations of matter (stars, planets, generally everything solid, liquid or plasma, and border conditions like their atmosphere) how dense interstellar matter can we find? What is the concentration of matter in densest nebulae that still don't collapse into bodies like planets or stars?  And conversely, how empty does the space get at its emptiest? I could imagine only very few particles in last their short moments of travel into the center exist under a black hole's event horizon, but other than that, how empty a space can be found in the universe, and where? "
647,Are Barlow lenses stackable for bright objects?,"I'm back to the refractor that I own, and I want to maximize the zoom capacity. I realized today that I own more than one barlow lens, and I was wondering if I could stack them together for looking at bright objects, like Jupiter. I'm aware that looking at anything else would probably be disastrous due to the stacked barlow lenses taking up more light. Is this an effective, or desirable way to approach the situation? What will happen if I do stack more than one barlow lens? Will it have the effect of an enhanced image, or will it do nothing but remove light? "
648,Could someone see anything while being inside black hole?,If we managed to survive in a black hole and move inside the event horizon then could we see the surroundings of the black hole inside the event horizon by source of light? Can the light not come up to the event horizon or does it have to travel through different spheres of the black hole and enter a sphere which won't allow the light to return to its previous sphere? If the we reach up to the singularity then can we ever reach up to the event horizon or would we get stuck in the point of the singularity? 
649,Does the sun have a feature like the red spot on Jupiter?,Does the sun have a feature or prominence like the red spot on Jupiter? Is there a feature that will remain as long as the red spot?  Maybe beneath the surface? 
650,What might cause a planet to have a significant tilt in their orbit?,"Most of the planets in our solar system all orbit along the same plane, supposedly because of the almost flat dust clouds that formed the planets.  But some planets, such as the one featured below, have a significant tilt in their orbits that separates them from the normal plane of orbit for that star.     Image courtesy of Science Daily  What might cause a planet to have such a tilt? Is this the star capturing a wandering body into orbit or is this a phenomena caused by the formation of these systems? "
651,"In theory, is there anywhere in the universe where velocity=0?","Earth is traveling at a certain velocity.  Earth orbits the Sun at velocity X.  The sun is orbiting the center of our galaxy at velocity Y.  The galaxy is orbiting (something?) at velocity Z. On and on...   In relation to zero, Earth has a velocity of X + Y + Z + (?).  Is it theoretically possible that there would be a point in space where nothing is moving and velocity is essentially 0?    If so, what would time look like at this point in space? "
652,Is a star powered by fission possible?,"Stars can easily fuse atoms to give of heat and radiation. But at Wikipedia it said that only sub-iron atoms give of energy when fused and take energy when split, and post-iron atoms is the exact opposite. So, if enough heavy elements got together could a ""reverse star"" be made in which it gives of light and heat through means of fission? How long would such a star last, and why aren't they common, if they even exist? "
653,How can I safely observe a Solar Flare?,Solar Flares obviously release extreme amounts of energy and extend thousands of miles out into space.   Because they are so big I would like to be able to observe some of these events through a telescope but I am wary of damaging both my eyes or the sensitive telescopic equipment.  How might I safely observe a solar flare through an amateur telescope? Might this be solved by using light filters to dim the amount of light entering the telescope or is a more specialist piece of equipment required? 
654,Simulation packages or theory to work with gravitational collapse of massive molecular clouds?,"So, I am getting interested in gravitational collapse of large molecular clouds that fragment and collapse into multiple stars. Are there well-known popular academic simulation packages that simulate these, for research purposes? Or are there papers or references I can use to write my own? "
655,Need help on Springel model for galaxy simulation,"I am working on a code for galactic dynamics simulation. Initial conditions (positions and velocities) are based on a model with a massive dark halo and a thin exponential disk.  Now, from the following paper ""Tidal tails in CDM cosmologies"", I am studying the response of the dark matter profile.  Here's a capture of the article part that confuses me :    Firstly, I don't understand how one gets equation (16) from the fact that angular momentum of individual dark matter orbits is conserved, i.e :  \begin{equation} r_{i}\,M(r_{i})=r_{f}\,M_{f}(r_{f})\quad\quad\text{(eq 16)}        \end{equation}  "" where [tex] and [tex] are the initial and final radii of some dark matter mass shell, [tex] gives the initial NFW mass profile, and [tex] is the final cumulative mass profile after the disk is formed.""  Question 1) Is (equation 16) got by the momentum theorem ? ([tex])  And how to prove it, i.e what's the demonstration to get (equation 16) ?  I don't understand what's the difference between [tex] and [tex].  After, it is said that [tex] is the sum of the cumulative mass of the disk and the dark mass inside the initial radius and author writes (equation 17 on paper) :  \begin{equation} M_{f}\,(r_{f})=M_{d}\,(r_{f})+(1 - m_{d})\,M(r_{i})\quad\quad\text{(eq 17)} \end{equation}  I would like to connect this equation with the total mass of galaxy which could be written (according to me) as :  \begin{equation} M_{total}\,(r) = M_{d}\,(r) + M_{DM}\,(r) = m_{d}\, M_{DM}\,(r) + M_{DM}\,(r) = (1+m_d)\, M_{DM}\,(r) \end{equation}  with [tex] the ratio between disk mass and halo mass.  Question 2) Could you help me to connect the total mass with this equation (17) ?  After with equation (18), author of paper writes that the final profile [tex] of the dark matter halo is then given by :  \begin{equation} M_{h}\,(r) = M_{f}\,(r) - M_{d}\,(r) \end{equation}  Question 3) So should I conclude that [tex] is the total mass of galaxy (disk + halo) as a function of [tex] ?  Any help would be great,  Regards  UPDATE 1 :  I have contacted the author of paper ""Tidal tails in CDM cosmologies"", i.e Volker Springel and here are its comments :     Question 1*) Answer: For simplicity, you can consider that all particles are on circular   orbits. The initial circular velocity of a particle is [tex], the final one is [tex]. The   corresponding angular momenta are [tex] and [tex].   Now, the angular momentum is an adiabatic invariant when the halo is   slowly compressed, hence [tex]. The latter equation then gives eqn   (16) when one plugs in the velocities.      Question 2*) ""I don't understand what's the difference between [tex] and   [tex] ?""       Answer:       [tex] is the initial and [tex] the final cumulative mass profile.      Question 3*)      I would like to connect this equation with the total mass of galaxy which could be written as :      [tex]      Answer : This can only be written for the initial distribution in   this form, where the assumption is that the mass that will later make   up the disk is distributed proportionally to the dark matter.      Question 4*)   Could you help me to connect the total mass with this equation (17) ?      After with equation (18), you write that the final profile M_{h}(r)$ of the dark matter halo is then given by :      [tex].      So should I conclude that M_f(r) is the total mass of galaxy (disk + halo) as a function of r ?   &lt; Answer : ""Yes.""   In conclusion, I can solve my question 1*) but not question 2*) nor question 3*)  Right now, my goal is to demonstrate how to get  :  $$\begin{equation} M_{f}\,(r_{f})=M_{d}\,(r_{f})+(1 - m_{d})\,M(r_{i})\quad\quad\text{(eq 17)} \end{equation}$$  Any help to acheive this is welcome, thanks "
656,Proof that Parallel Universes exist,"Today I heard on the radio that the Super Collider has discovered mini black holes.

657,How can I clean my lenses without causing scratching or damages to the lens surface?,"Sometimes you can be trying to observe very faint or very small objects in the sky and it wouldn't pay to have these obscured or marred by a scratch or dust on the lenses.  I keep to good practices and make sure to replace the cap on the lenses when finished in order to stop dust buildup but inevitably it will get a little dusty and dirty, taking this into consideration:  What steps do I need to take to ensure that my lenses are kept in top condition?  Can I simply use a damp cloth or sponge and dab the lenses or should I use a softer material, like someone with glasses might have a softer lens cleaner?  Do I require a special cleaning fluid or can a good quality clean be done without any additional cleaning agents? "
658,Dealing with damp and dew whilst stargazing at night or in the early morning,"Sometimes when using my telescope late at night or early in the morning, especially in the more humid of seasons, I notice i sometimes get dew buildup on the lenses.   How can I minimize damp buildup whilst using my telescope?  Simply dabbing away the liquid with a dry cloth doesn't seem to do the trick as I am still left with some water tracks and residue that I just can't soak up, this then means that all of the light is refracted providing a very fuzzy and blurry image.   What preventative measures can i take to stop damp build up in the first place? "
659,What reason is there to doubt the existence of the hypothesised planet Tyche in the far distant solar system?,"Please note, I do not necessarily believe in its existence, just after a scientific (hence, non-Wikipedia) reasoning to doubt the planet's existence, other than the ""we would have seen it"" argument.  I am, nor are the articles below, referring to the alleged 'Nemesis' planet, as in the question What are the current observational constraints on the existence of Nemesis?  According to the article Astronomers Doubt Giant Planet 'Tyche' Exists in Our Solar System (Wolchover, 2011), the planet Tyche is a hypothesised massive planet      by John Matese and Daniel Whitmire of the University of Lousiana-Lafayette, is not new: They have been making a case for Tyche since 1999, suggesting that the giant planet's presence in a far-flung region of the solar system called the Oort cloud would explain the unusual orbital paths of some comets that originate there.   Further information is found in the scientists' research paper Persistent Evidence of a Jovian Mass Solar Companion in the Oort Cloud (Matese and Whitmire, 2010), describe the hypothesised planet to be      of mass  1 − 4 M(Jupiter) orbiting in the   innermost region of the outer Oort cloud. Our most restrictive prediction is that the orientation   angles of the orbit normal in galactic coordinates are centered on    , the galactic longitude of   the ascending node = 319 and i, the galactic inclination = 103 (or the opposite direction)   with an uncertainty in the normal direction subtending  2% of the sky.   They posit that the elongated orbit of Sedna is a result of the presence of this planet.  So, the question, what reason is there to doubt the existence of Tyche? "

661,Is the moon rotation at complete standstill?,"Moon always faces Earth with one side, its spin period equal its orbital period - this is what we learn at school.  But I know Nature rarely operates in absolutes. I'd find it hard to believe Moon wouldn't spin relative to Earth at least very slowly. I searched but found no data other than ""doesn't"", so I'd like to ask - does the Moon stay turned the same side precisely - or do, over many years, new features show at one edge? If it does, how long would it take to make a full turn? "
662,Is it possible that some stars are already black holes yet we see light emitted from before becoming a black hole?,"For stars we see that are burning fuel at a fast rate, that are very bright, (or any star for that matter sufficiently far away from us) could it be that they are already black holes (the sufficiently large ones) and we are just seeing the light emitted during it's main phase? So, if so, is it safe to say that most of the stars are already dead that we see?  Edit: I appreciate all the answers. This has been a fascinating read. I also hate having to select a ""the answer"" when I gleaned something from all of them. "
663,Shadows of Light = Space or Dark Matter?,"Perhaps my title is misleading. but here is my understanding and I'm looking for confirmation.  You cannot have dark without light.  The only thing faster than light is darkness (i.e. shadows)  Stars are in the galaxy and are inherently bright.  Does this make ""dark matter"" mere shadows of extremely bright objects?  Is that also why it has to get dark before we can really see the majority of stars (subjective experience)?  Update:  With all due respect to user with answer below and thank you for taking the time to answer... I think this can be expanded on.  I have provided a source for my claims: youtu.be/JTvcpdfGUtQ   Check out the video, and it more explains my understanding of things...  Why I don't accept answer below:  Can you provide sources for your claims?  Also I didn't say you can't have DARK MATTER without Light , I said you can't have Dark, as in Darkness. I think you're getting hung up on Dark Matter which is a big part of my question, but not the entire question.  Also, are you claiming that all darkness in space is dark matter? I don't like to assume but for scientific purposes (not an accredited scientist) would we not agree that the measures made on dark matter were on a sample, and not the entire universe?  So to further question this, do shadows not exist in space? "
664,"Do astronomers, in principle, have more information about older phenomena than younger?","The further away we see, the older states of the world we observe. And the volume of the part of space which is observable, increases by the square of the distance to it. So there should basically be a million times more phenomena (data) observable about what happened a billion years ago, than about what happened a million years ago. Given good enough observatories.  This is obviously counter intuitive, and sorting it out for so called redshift effects doesn't help in that respect. Do/can we really (potentially) know more about things/events the older they are? Is there some epistemological problem involved in that? "
665,Why don't Neutron Stars form event horizon?,"Trying to compare density of Black Holes and Neutron Stars I came up with the following:     A typical neutron star has a mass between about 1.4 and 3.2 solar masses1[3] (see Chandrasekhar Limit), with a corresponding radius of about 12 km. (...) Neutron stars have overall densities of 3.7×10^17 to 5.9×10^17 kg/m^3 [1]   and     You can use the Schwarzschild radius to calculate the ""density"" of the black hole - i.e., the mass divided by the volume enclosed within the Schwarzschild radius. This is roughly equal to (1.8x10^16 g/cm^3) x (Msun / M)^2 (...)      The value of the Schwarzschild radius works out to be about (3x10^5 cm) x (M / Msun) [2]   Let's take a neutron star from the top of the spectrum (3.2 Msun) and same mass black hole.  Converting units:    Neutron star: 5.9×10^17 kg/m^3 = 5.9 × 10^14 g/cm^3  Black hole: 1.8x10^16 g/cm^3 x (1/5.9)^2 = 5.2 x10^14 g/cm^3    The radius of the black hole would be (3x10^5 cm) x ( 5.2 ) = 15.6km  The 3.2Msun Neutron Star of this density would have volume of 1.08 x 10^13 m^3 which gives radius of 13.7 kilometers  According to Shell Theorem, spherical objects' gravity field strength at given distance is the same for spheres as for point masses so at the same distance from center of same mass (point - black hole, sphere - neutron star) the gravity will be the same.  That would put the surface of the neutron star below the surface of event horizon of equivalent black hole. Yet I never heard about even horizon of neutron stars.  Either I made a mistake in my calculations (and if I did, could you point it out?) or... well, why? "
666,Two species of dark matter?,"At this point in time, evidence for the existence of dark matter has accumulated in many ways:    it affects galactic rotation curves plays a major role in cosmology, and the evolution of structure in the universe is predicted in copious amounts by gravitational lensing on a wide range of scales influences the dynamics of galaxy clusters   to name a few.  There are many known candidates for dark matter particles: WIMPs, axions, WISPs, neutrinos, etc (in fact, even bricks, though some other considerations would exclude them).  The question then is:  Why do we expect that only one type of dark matter particles is responsible for phenomenological dark matter?   For example, [tex]CDM cosmology, the standard cosmological model, requires dark matter to be cold (slow, non-relativistic), which is used to constrain the possible properties of dark matter particles. However, this doesn't actually imply, that dark matter is cold for all the astrophysical systems. For example, galactic halos could be made of warm dark matter, and halos of dwarf galaxies could be made of cold dark matter.  One might of course say that one-species model is the simplest one. The counter-argument would be that in reality there well may be many species. This in turn might have profound implications for astrophysical models.   To summarize the question: Is there any good reason, preferably supported by observations, to think that only one species of dark matter is present in all the models currently used? "
667,Question about Hubble parameter (Hubble constant) and measuring it,"I see this question in ""An introduction to modern cosmology - Andrew Liddle - Wiley Publication"":     In the real Universe the expansion is not completely uniform. Rather,   galaxies exhibit some random motion relative to the overall Hubble   expansion, known as their pecuLiar veLocity and caused by the   gravitational pull of their near neighbours. Supposing that a typical   (eg root mean square) galaxy peculiar velocity is 600 km/s, how far   away would a galaxy have to be before it could be used to determine   the Hubble constant to ten per cent accuracy, supposing      (a) The true   value of the Hubble constant is 100 km/s Mpc?      (b) The true value   of the Hubble constant is 50 km/sMpc ?      Assume in your   calculation that the galaxy distance and red-shift could be measured   exactly. Unfortunately, that is not true of real observations.   I really don't know how to start solving this. What do we need to find Hubble constant. I know [tex] but I don't know how to calculate the effect of peculiar velocity. we don't know [tex] and [tex] in Hubble formula, how to find [tex]? "
668,How can we tell if the asteroid 2013 TV135 will hit Earth in 2032?,"Some astronomers in Ukraine have estimated that there is a small likelihood (1 in 63,000) that the asteroid 2013 TV135 will strike Earth in 2032. (source)  Don Yeoman of NASA JPL says:     with more observations, I fully expect we will be able to significantly reduce, or rule out entirely, any impact probability for the foreseeable future.   How can we improve our estimation of the potential threat posed by 2013 TV135?  That is, what process and techniques are used to calculate and increase the accuracy of our collision threat estimation? "
669,"Do astronomers and astrophysicists more often use diameters or radii when discussing about planets, dwarf planets, exoplanets and stars?","Mathematicians much more often use radii over diameters when discussing about circles and spheres, because in mathematics the radius is more fundamental than the diameter (the sphere is defined using its radius).  But what about in astronomy? Do astronomers and astrophysicist more often use diameters or radii when characterizing planets, dwarf planets, exoplanets and stars? "
670,Is it possible to use the stars to determine the passage of time?,"I'm writing a science fiction short story which involves a group of people being in suspended animation for a very long period of time, on the order of thousands of years.  My question is, would an astronomer on waking be able to determine that a significant period of time has passed purely by making observations in the night sky? How accurate would they be?  For the purposes of the story, I'm more interested in what an astronomer could observe unaided or with a primitive telescope of the sort Galileo might have had early in his career (around 3X magnification).  Thanks! "

672,How uniformly is cometary debris distributed along the entire orbit of the comet?,"Meteor showers occur when Earth passes through debris shed by a comet (if I get that right). Does this mean that the entire orbit of the comet is strewn with debris? I suppose that the debris follows the same orbit as the comet core it was released from as it passed close enough to the Sun for ices of different kinds to sublimate. Is the debris that cause meteor showers somewhat evenly distributed along a huge ellipse crossing the orbits of Earth and (often) Jupiter?   Are such cometary debris streams, and not only those crossing Earth's orbit, somehow cataloged and characterized? "
673,Loss of atmosphere on Mars,"If the atmosphere on Mars was once much thicker, how was it likely lost?  Was it due to interaction with the solar wind, the small size of the planet, both, or something else, and approximately how long did it take to reach its current thickness? "
674,Light that travels eternally because of inflation?,"What happens with electromagentic waves that are emitted into  intergalactic space, but reach not any object because of inflation? Lets assume that photon A and photon B are emitted. Photon B hits some object, photon A enters a gigantic void or simply has nothing in its path, and heads for the horizon, so to say.  Relativity tells that A and B do not ""feel"" time passing. From our point of view B travels a finite time, while in the frame of B the object is reached instantly. However, since A will be eternally underway, what is going to happen? We have kind of a zero*infinity travelling time in the frame of A.  Do our models make statements about this? Or is there some explanation "
675,Calculating Radial Velocity from Hipparcos,"Using data from Hipparcos is it possible to calculate Radial Velocity.  If we take 19 Leonis as example, RV is -3.70.

676,Where does energy at the beginning of a star's lifecycle (before any nuclear reactions) come from?,"David Christian's Maps of Time has this to say about the period during which the first stars started to form from the diffuse clouds of hydrogen and helium that then made up the universe:     Under the pull of their own gravity, the clouds of hydrogen and helium began to collapse in on themselves...As gravity packed each cloud into ever smaller spaces, pressure built up in the center. Increasing pressure means increasing temperatures, and so, as they shrank, each gas cloud began to heat up (~Kindle location 1469).   The part I'm working on understanding is ""Increasing pressure means increasing temperatures."" Does the pressure itself cause the molecules to heat up? Or is it the kinetic energy that the particles pick up as gravity pulls them towards the center of the cloud? Or is the phenomenon here something other than increased energy per unit mass?  Of course, once the nuclear chain reaction gets started in the star it's not hard to figure out where the energy comes from. I'm talking about before that. "
677,How much did we know about asteroids at the beginning of the 20th century?,"When was the nature and size of asteroids discovered? I was under the impression that it was not until the 1980s or 1990s with deeper space probes and Hubble imagery that we learned the nature of asteroids. However, today the wonderful fortune UNIX script gave this quote from a man who died in 1910:     Noise proves nothing. Often a hen who has merely laid an egg cackles   as if she laid an asteroid.  -- Mark Twain   How would Samuel Langhorne Clemens have known enough about asteroids to make such a statement in the early 20th century? "
678,Why can't we see the supermassive black holes supposedly at the center of galaxies?,"Is gravitational lensing responsible for obscuring (figuratively) the supposed supermassive black holes at the center of our own and other galaxies? By ""see"" I mean relative to the measuring tools we are using. A radio telescope ""sees"" in radio waves.   In Hubble photos of galaxies, no black holes appear to be present in galaxy centers, at least not visually. How can this be explained? "
679,What are IRAS sources?,Do IRAS sources refer to star forming regions? I searched google and I came to know that it stands for IR astronomical satellite.But what do they search for? Please help me 
680,How can I observe the Orionid Meteor Shower?,"I would like to see the orionids sometime this week (October 20-26, 2013). What is the best way for me to observe them by naked eye?  Also, would I be benefitted by trying to look at them with a telescope or or are they too fast and spontaneous for most amateurs to capture? "
681,Why did Venus not lose its atmosphere without magnetic field?,"It is often stated that the magnetosphere not only shields the planet from cosmic radiation, but also prevents atmospheric loss. Why then did Venus not lose most of its atmosphere if it doesn't have a strong magnetic field? Is there another mechanism at play, or is the statement about the importance of magnetosphere to atmospheric loss prevention wrong?  "
682,What is radiation pressure and how does it prevent a star from forming?,This is a follow up to: Is there a theoretical maximum size limit for a star?  The answer there talks about the radiation pressure preventing a star from forming.     What reaction is causing this radiation pressure and why does this potentially prevent a star from forming? 
683,Sources of Turbulence in the ISM,What sources of turbulence exist within the Interstellar medium (ISM)? Which ones are physically the most important for newly forming stellar systems? 
684,Mass resolution,Can someone define mass resolution in terms of cosmological simulations such as the millennium simulation? Is it just the smallest mass that a dark matter particle can have and still be detected by the simulation?  
685,Does our sun/solar system orbit around any other celestial objects?,"Does our solar system orbit around another massive celestial object? Like a massive star or black hole for instance? From my understanding our sun rotates around the centre of our galaxy, thus our solar system follows. But I'm curious to know if there is/are other(s) gravitational force(s) that affect our suns? Other than the rotation around the centre of the milky way.  It would make sense to me that the gravity of massive objects would affect our sun, which in turn would affect our solar system, but I cannot find any answers other than ones concerning the ""galactic year"". "
686,How was Sugar Grove Station supposed to work?,Sugar Grove Station was an outpost designed to listen in on Soviet radio signals reflected off the moon.  How would this work?  Wouldn't the radio signals be distorted by the imperfect surface of the moon?  And wouldn't they also be extremely weak since they wouldn't be beamed directly at the moon? 
687,Is starquake unique to neutron star?,"I read from somewhere that astronomer use X-ray to observe the ""shaking"" not to be confused with wobbling of a distant neutron star, I think it is similar to what geologist using microphone to detecting sound wave (vibration) inside the earth (no pun) to find out its composition. How does a tightly packed super dense object like neutron star generate starquake? is this neutron star signature move... i mean trait? "
688,How dense are Saturn's rings?,"I assume that the A ring is the densest, but I might be wrong. Nevertheless, I failed to find any explicit information over the net about the minimum and maximum of densities for the different rings. As a less practical question: what would one see upon entering one of the denser rings? Would it be obvious that it is a dense but thin (few metres - 1 km) cloud of particles, continuously bombarding the spacecraft irregardless whether it orbits along within the ring, or one would not see more than just a distant haze (if lit by the Sun) that spans over the horizon? "
689,Why does the eclipse in this video look annular?,"In this article about the AS870 flight that flew through the umbra of the March 8-9 2016 solar eclipse, there is a link to a YouTube video showing the eclipse recored by a handheld camera in the cabin.   Of course this is personal video and not recorded for analysis, but the images - especially during the zoomed part - remind me of an annular eclipse, rather than a total eclipse. Below are some screenshots - the weak Fresnel reflections in the cabin window act a bit like attenuators (ND filters) and give less saturated, though distorted views. Basically they all look like donuts.  My first thinking was that if it was a total eclipse on the ground, it couldn't be annular at 35,000 feet closer to the moon. But thinking and looking again, the sun is near the horizon, and the plane at about 150 West longitude is not necessarily closer to the sun than observers on the ground were in Indonesia circa 120 East.  My question is - is that just corona, or is the plane farther away enough from the moon at this time and location to make the eclipse annular?   It may be helpful to read about hybrid eclipses.  note: I'm looking for a quantitative answer, not an opinion.  There is another version of the video on YouTube with more views, but the narrative doesn't hold a candle to double rainbow guy original and musical version.     Here is a screenshot of a typical AS870 flight from flightradar24.com, pretty much between 152 and 158 degrees west.    This is from the second link in the top line - the Alaska Airlines blog entry for the flight.    How an eclipse could possibly appear annular from a plane over one place on the planet while appearing total on the ground at another place on the planet 5,000 kilometers away (note, these occur at different times - the shadow is moving relative to earth and the earth is rotating):   "
690,Does gravitational lensing cause a black-hole to be the main 'source' of light in a given area?,"  Light gets bent around high-gravity sources, such as a black-hole. A source of light, say A, is directly observed in its 'true' position and some of its light is bent around the black-hole, X, which gives a second observation of A, called A'.  Does gravitational lensing cause the amount of emissions (detected as coming from the (point/position/direction) of X) to far exceed anything else in that vicinity?   Does this then make the 'black-hole' by far the brightest, noisiest thing to be observed? (kind of like waving &amp; shouting in a quiet room)  [edit - based on astromax's answer] I follow what is meant regarding super massive black-holes. Consider the following scenario: A suitable massive sun on dying contracts into a (small) black-hole. This black-hole will now cause a lensing-effect, but since it is small the amount of emissions so 'lensed' around it is very small and maybe too small to detect? or, it is detected but erroneously ascribed to be a type of sun or other type of emission source? "
691,What is the exact meaning of vicinity of Black hole or a disk? the same as inside?,"What is the exact meaning of vicinity of Blackhole or a disk? Is this the same as inside the horizon for black holes? If so, why people don't say inside of BH, simply. What is the difference?  I use this phrase actually! and it may seem obvious but not to me, please somebody make it clear. I searched but I couldn't find an exact answer.  Edited: Until which radius from Blackhole I can use this word meaningfully? It's not clear to me its astronomical dimension. ""near"" is not enough to me. If it could be inside a horizon and also outside of it, it makes a huge difference from point of view of the observer at infinity, as you know, how I can call them by the same name and sometimes I mean one sometimes the other one.  "
692,Pyramid shaped observatories,"There are some pyramid shaped observatories around the world, like the Solar Lab Pyramid in the Canary Islands or The Pyramid International Laboratory in Nepal.  I was wondering, why a pyramid? Because of its relative stability, or is there something else?    below: Solar Lab Pyramid in the Canary Islands.    below: The Pyramid International Laboratory in Nepal.   "
693,Do objects that are invisible to the naked eye occlude much of the stars to Earth based observers?,"I was looking at a star recently and some other object that appeared to be stationary in relation to the star was occluding the light to only one of my eyes. This is why it caught my attention.  I was able to move my head around this shadow and see the star but there was a definite tiny area where the star was clearly hidden. The object hiding the star also appeared to be a similar size to the tiny point of light of the star. Is this common to observe?  For the last few days I have been asking myself how many objects could be hidden like this (though most with shadows that engulf the earth); How thick are asteroid belts etc, that are between our eyes and the rest of the stars.  Is most of it hidden? "
694,Could stellar occultations be used to survey Kuiper belt objects?,"The first hint we had as to the shape of Ultima Thule was via an occultation study using an array of small telescopes. Has anyone investigated the feasibility and effectiveness of conducting a survey campaign using the same technique?  Given that this was managed for an arbitrarily selected object in a window of few years, it would seem that, if you just wanted to do the same thing for as many Kuiper belt objects as you can manage, that you should be able to get similar data for a significant number of objects a year at relatively low cost.    Edit: the kind of project I'm wondering about would be targeted at getting detailed shape (e.g. what fraction of KBOs are contact binaries?) and size data. For example a line of a few hundred 0.5m class interments at 100m to km spacing.    Edit 2: I guess I kind of didn't actually say what the target of the survey would be. To clarify, the objective would be to collect fine detail on the shape of KBOs. E.g. how common are contact binaries? "
695,Is there a natural process by which hydrogen is generated from heavier elements in the cosmos?,"we know that stars fuse hydrogen into helium starting at 3 MK; 13 MK in the Sun's core;  carbon fusion starts at above 500 million K, and silicon fusion starts at over 2700 million K for comparison; we know fusion stops at iron, because a star has to use more energy to fuse that than it gets back; so heavier elements are created mostly in a supernova (but also possible in small quantities by special processes like neutron capture); finally sun-like stars end up as white dwarfs, bigger stars as neutron stars, quark stars, black holes; and black holes ultimately convert themselves into radiation, in the far distant future when the stable black hole mass limit goes up high enough that even the most massive black holes evaporate;  [website]so my question is, will it be like Stephen Baxter said, that in the future only radiation will be left in the universe? Specifically, is there a natural process out there by which hydrogen is spewed into the cosmos, converted back from heavier elements, to regenerate the fuel for stars so that they may shine in the far distant future as well?  Of course we don't need to worry about this for the time being. This is only considering our concern with what will be 10^70 years from now. "
696,A greenish blue patch in the sky during sunset,"I observed a greenish blue patch in the red sky after sunset, and it stayed for not more than 5 minutes. It didn't curve or appear distorted; it was just like a carpet. Why is it so? Could it have been an aurora?   Thank you   location: 9° N, 78° E; Temperature 35 deg C.   "
697,"How far is the Earth/Sun above/below the galactic plane, and is it heading toward/away from it?","How far is the Earth/Sun above/below the galactic plane, and is it heading toward/away from it? We know the Sun is orbiting the galactic center every 225 million years. But how far are we from the galactic plane, and is the inclination of the plane of the Sun's orbit around the galactic center, as compared to the galactic plane, known?    According to this drawing    the Sun is traveling approximately in the ecliptic plane. However, the ecliptic plane is steeply inclined to the galactic plane, so if this drawing is correct (from voyager.jpl.nasa.gov) then this would mean the plane of the Sun's orbit around the galactic center is also quite inclined. And thus my question, what is the distance to the galactic plane, are we heading toward/away from it, and what is the inclination of the orbital plane of our Sun/solar system to the galactic plane? 3 questions I guess. "
698,Can we apply Kepler's law of planetary motion to the moons motion around the earth?,"I have been trying to understand Kepler's law of planetary motion for a while. So I was thinking, if it would even apply to the moon orbiting around the earth. Does the moon too orbit in an ellipse too? Does its orbit have the same properties as the earth's orbit around the sun? "
699,How is the distance from Earth to distant celestial bodies calculated?,"It's difficult for most people to grasp how distances between the Earth and distant celestial bodies are calculated. For example, when someone tells me that a given star is 100 light years away, how would I determine if that were accurate?  I think that my question boils down to three general use cases:   How can I calculate the distance between Earth and a local body in our solar system such as the sun, Jupiter, our moon, or Neptune? How can I calculate the distance between Earth and the nearest star outside of our own solar system, Alpha Centauri? How can I calculate the distance between Earth and an extremely distant object, such as a star 100-1,000 light-years away?   I've heard of using red shift to calculate large distances, but what exactly is this and how does it work? "
700,Why is there billowing dust in nebulae?,Why do some nebulae look like the billowing clouds? Wouldn't that require something like a viscosity in empty space? 
701,Integral Field Spectroscopy vs Fabry-Perot Interferometry,"Why are Fabry-Perot Interferometers (FPIs) and Fourier Transform Spectrographs (FTSs less common than Integral Field Spectrographs (IFS) nowadays? My understanding is that:   With FPIs and FTSs you have to scan your spectral range over time. This (A) Takes more telescope time, and (B) Is affected by seeing variations over time (i.e., different wavelengths end up having different PSFs). Limited spectral range. As a result, you have limited information about the observed object. I was also under the impression that reducing FPI or FTS data is more complex. However I do not have a reference to support this claim. It this true? If it is, can someone explain why? For some reason FPIs use Image Photon Counting System (IPCS) instead of CCDs. Why is that? Does this somehow make them ""worse"" than IFSs?   What other advantages does IFS have over FPI and FTS? "
702,Is there a strict chronological order that determines the shape of galaxies?,"Assuming no collision happens, do all elliptical galaxies eventually become spiral? also when a galaxy becomes spiral or barred spiral, can it switch between these shapes or is it set forever? "
703,How rare are earth-like solar eclipses?,"Solar eclipses on the earth are so spectacular because the moon has roughly the same size as the sun when viewed from the earth's surface. This is an incredible coincidence, and my guess is that it is a very uncommon phenomenon in the universe.  Is it possible to say anything sensible about the likelihood of a planet having a moon and a sun with same apparent size? Is it possible to make an educated guess about how many places in the universe you would be able to see an earth-like solar eclipse? "
704,How does neutron star collapse into black hole?,"We know the spectacular explosions of supernovae, that when heavy enough, form black holes. The explosive emission of both electromagnetic radiation and massive amounts of matter is clearly observable and studied quite thoroughly. If the star was massive enough, the remnant will be a black hole. If it wasn't massive enough, it will be a neutron star.  Now there's another mode of creation of black holes: the neutron star captures enough matter, or two neutron stars collide, and their combined mass creates enough gravity force to cause another collapse - into a black hole.  What effects are associated with this? Is there an explosive release of some kind of radiation or particles? Is it observable? What physical processes occur in the neutrons as they are subjected to the critical increase of pressure? What is the mass of the new black hole, comparing to its neutron star of origin? "
705,What discoveries have come from the DASCH project (Digital Access to a Sky Century @ Harvard),"@astrosnapper's answer to the question Could stellar occultations be used to survey Kuiper belt objects? mentions the TAOS-II project and asteroid occultation measurements (which occur on the timescale of seconds) and that got me thinking about the term Time Domain Astronomy.  A quick search led me to an Astrobites post with a catchy title A Big Step Backward for Time Domain Astronomy that (among other things) describes the DASCH project (Digital Access to a Sky Century @ Harvard).  The post is dated 2012 and says:     The project is working to (1) digitally scan all of the plates, (2) detect sources on the plates, (3) assign physical coordinates to the plates, and (4) measure/calibrate the magnitudes of all sources.  The end product will be a publicly available database which can be queried to produce the 100 year light curve for individual objects.  As a part of the project the team had to develop a specialized scanner, as commercially available units would have been too slow to finish the project in anything resembling a reasonable amount of time. As it is, when operating at full efficiency, the project can now scan and analyze 400 plates a day.  As of the writing of this article, 38,346 plates have been scanned (~8% completion; see Figure 2 for a map of their current coverage) and over 2.7 billion magnitudes have already been measured.   The article ends with:     ...Given that we’re only 8% of the way through analyzing the plates, we can look forward to further interesting discoveries from this survey in the next few years.   It is now six years later. Presumably the scan rate has accelerated a bit and a much larger fraction of the plates have been scanned, and techniques for reducing and analyzing the huge amounts of data have improved as well.  Since 2012, what new discoveries have been made from this effort? There may be too many to list, so a few highlights and a link to a summary might be the best way to answer. "
706,Is there a map of the galaxies?,"I see that there are many maps of a single galaxy, the Milky Way, showing the positions of the stars within our galaxy.  I could not find a map of Galaxies, however. Is there such a map? In lieu of that I suppose I could make my own map if I knew celestial coordinates of all the nearby galaxies and the distances to those galaxies. Is there such a data table readily available? "
707,Finding the lens diameter of a telescope by magnitude,   We have a telescope that can see stars with about +14 magnitude. how to find its lens (or mirror) diameter? (I mean the [tex] in formula [tex])   I don't know whether I can assume that the temperature of star is equal to temperature of the sun or not. but if we think that they are equal we get this:  [tex] if we solve this with what we know about magnitude of sun (-26.83 or something close to it between -25 to -27) and another things like radii we get:  ([tex] and from that and formula [tex] and [tex] we get something like D = [tex]. which is very big for a telescope. what's the problem? how to solve this? Is this answer correct? 
708,How Does Cosmology Constrain the Number of Neutrino Species?,"I've asked this question already on the Physics SE, but I felt it would be worth posting here as well.  I know that based upon theories of structure formation cosmologists can constrain the sum of the masses of neutrinos - if neutrinos were too light or too heavy it would simply change the power spectrum of the universe.   My question is how exactly is the number of neutrino species constrained by cosmological measurements (i.e. - [tex] as measured by WMAP or Planck)? The recent results from the Planck Satellite give us [tex], which is consistent with three neutrino species. How is this measured? "

711,How big do comets get?,"If my understanding is correct, Chury, the best explored comet so far is rather on the smallish side as comets go. Most comets observable with naked eye were so because they flew close to Earth, not because they were so big. I wonder, though, how big are the biggest ones.   Let's get it in two variants:   How big is the biggest known comet? (mass, diameter) Is there an estimate, or a theoretical limit on how big a comet can be? (for whatever reason, e.g. becoming a planet, breaking up due to tidal forces or whatever)  "
712,Why doesn't the vertical light beam get out of a black hole?,"I'm asking this question as a follow-up to if light has no mass why is it affected by gravity?  Imagine you’re standing on a gedanken planet, shining a laser beam straight up into space. The light goes straight up. It doesn’t curve, and it doesn’t fall back down. Now imagine it’s a denser more massive planet. The light still goes straight up. It still doesn’t curve, and it still doesn’t fall back down. Let’s make it a really massive planet. That light still goes straight up. It still doesn’t curve, and it still doesn’t fall back down:  But when we make our gedanken planet so massive that it’s a black hole, all of a sudden light can’t escape. Why? Why doesn’t the light get out? Why doesn't the vertical light beam get out of a black hole?  "
713,Naming of the planets of the solar system,"Planets of the solar system have been named with Roman mythology gods names. I have a few questions on my mind concerning that subject for a while:   Who decided to name them like this? When did the planets got named?   Finally, the ultimate question is: if the planets got named by the Romans, implying they had not technology to observe the solar system whatsoever, why some of the names match the color of the planets?    Mars is red - Mars is the god of war Neptune is blue - Neptune is the god of the oceans   Or maybe I am wrong (most likely) and the planets have been named more recently. "
714,How much of an effect does the moon have on Earth's liquid mantle?,"The gravitational pull of the moon is enough to create tidal forces of large bodies of liquid, i.e the sea.   I was having a conversation the other day about how to terraform Mars, and someone suggested that if Mars was to have a moon artificially placed there then its gravitational effects would help keep a liquid core flowing.  Does the moon therefore also have an effect on other large bodies of liquid on Earth? Does the moons gravitational pull affect in any way the flow of Earths liquid mantle? "
715,Are there more images with different filters available for the April 6 Hubble image of Jupiter?,"This recent HST image of Jupiter near opposition is described here and here and was made under HST proposal 14756. It was taken with WFC3/UVIS. It is made from three images using narrow-band filters at 395, 502, and 631 nanometers.   I am wondering if there were additional images recorded with filters at other wavelengths. If so, how could I go about finding them?   "
716,.2015: When last did both New/Full moon in a fort-night cause an Eclipse?,"Going through [website]March 20, 2015 - New moon - is a Solar Eclipse, and that the succeeding April 04, 2015 - Full moon - heralds a Lunar Eclipse.   Is it common that both New/Full moon in a fort-night cause an eclipse? When was the last time an Eclipse occurred back-to-back on a consecutive New Moon/Full Moon?  "
717,Photon Paradox?,"Imagine a photon reaching the Hubble Space Telescope today had originally been emitted from a star in the early universe 13 billion years ago. Einstein’s Special Relativity tells us, traveling at the speed of light, that from the photon’s frame of reference, no time will have passed for the photon between the moment it was emitted from the star and the instant it was recorded by the Hubble telescope. In addition, at the speed of light, the length contraction (or Lorentz contraction) is said to shrink the distance between these two objects (the ancient star and the Hubble telescope) to zero. But herein lies the apparent paradox in two parts: 1) In the early universe 13 billion years ago when the star first emitted the photon, there was no Hubble Telescope for the photon to instantaneously collide with from its frame of reference. In other words, how can the photon instantly collide with something which won't be invented for 13 billion years? 2) Given the complete length contraction of all points in space to zero at the speed of light, how can a single photon ever be absorbed at any one particular point when, if all distance between points in the universe is zero from the photon’s frame of reference, the photon will hit each and every point throughout the universe simultaneously, not just one?   If you could help me understand this apparent paradox in laymen’s terms, it would be greatly appreciated. "
718,Mars night sky - how many stars visible?,How would the night sky look like from the Martian surface?  Would there be more stars visible or less (compared to Earth)?  Would they appear brighter/dimmer/same? 
719,Gravitational eddies across the galaxy?,I read about natural gravitational eddies that travel in a wave that black holes have. They also have a strong magnetic field. Does those eddies follow magnetic field lines of the rotating black hole?  Can a galaxies have their own gravitational eddies like a black hole does?   
720,What are the challenges for the building and data analysis of the CHIME telescope?,"CHIME has discovered the second repeated fast fast burst recently. However, its structure is simple apparently. I wonder why we did not build a telescope before. What is the challenge? I just know its data volume is large. It is difficult to update the telescope?  There are 4 cylinders and 1024 antennas. What determines the distribution of the 1024 antennas? I mean why is it not just one longer cylinder? "

722,How would you relate the respective solar gravitational pulls of two planets?,"I was asked this question:     How much weaker is the gravitational pull of the Sun on Neptune at 30 AU, than it is on Earth at 1 AU?   How would I even begin to determine this? "
723,Are there other proofs of the expanding universe apart from the redshift?,"The theory of the expanding universe is so widely accepted, that the redshift is sometimes used as a measure of distance to far away galaxies.  But is it still possible that the redshift is caused by some unknown phenomena and not by galaxies moving away from each other?  Is there any other proof (apart from the redshift) that the universe is indeed expanding and far away galaxies are moving away from us? "
724,How Soon Could a Waxing Crescent Moon Be Seen?,"Question:     Apart from a Solar Eclipse, How much time is needed until a Waxing Crescent Moon be seen following a New Moon?    Would the time of year be significant? The Vernal Equinox + 1 Month. Could it be seen the same night that it occurs? Could it be seen in the day when it occurs? Would this be affected if the viewer was in a rural location, without lights? Or would city lights help?   Context:  Ancient Lunar calendars depended on observation of the New Moon, (like political / religious obligations).  What was the potential margin of error? Hours? a Day? (Not considering bad-weather.)  From Wikipedia - A New Moon Cannot be Seen:     In astronomy, new moon is the first phase of the Moon, when it orbits as seen from the Earth, the moment when the Moon and the Sun have the same ecliptical longitude. The Moon is not visible at this time except when it is seen in silhouette during a solar eclipse when it is illuminated by earthshine.   Related:    Is it possible for a person to not see the new moon at different places on earth? From which country or area is the new moon visible first?  "
725,Observation of Gravitional waves by LIGO from binary black hole merger,"I read the paper ""Observation of Gravitational Waves from a Binary Black Hole Merger"" [website]I tried to understand all the graphs and data observed in the paper. I am curious how these data and graphs conclude that the gravitational waves observed were because of binary black holes merger? Also what calculations and equations led to the same? Also how will the calculations and equations look if neutron stars were there instead of black hole in the same merger?  (graphs and data can be seen in the observation section in the paper) "
726,How big is one arcsecond at various distances?,"I've been reading this article [website]and a question came to my mind.  The minimum units are seconds ( ″ ). I picture an angle of 1 second as being like a ""cone"" going out from Earth. It's really small at the beginning but as you go further its width increases.  How wide does this cone get as you get further into the universe? How big is an arcsecond on different astronomical bodies? "
727,Musk's Roadster is now Russell's Teapot?,"Space Exploration Stack Exchange were not very fond of this question and closed it, so I think it might fit better here.   Summary: Assuming no foreknowledge of its existence, can Elon Musk's Tesla Roadster be detected and categorised from Earth?   Bertrand Russell argued the following, an argument that is now known as Russell's Teapot (emphasis mine):      Many orthodox people speak as though it were the business of sceptics to disprove received dogmas rather than of dogmatists to prove them. This is, of course, a mistake. If I were to suggest that between the Earth and Mars there is a china teapot revolving about the sun in an elliptical orbit, nobody would be able to disprove my assertion provided I were careful to add that the teapot is too small to be revealed even by our most powerful telescopes.   Well now we have a midnight cherry red automobile, between Earth and Mars, in an elliptical orbit around the Sun.     Now assume that this civilisation we have falls. The knowledge of this automobile is lost. Then in some centuries/millennia later humanity has managed to work its way back to a level of technology comparable to what we have today.   Could this automobile then be detected by ""our most powerful telescopes""?  I guess that we could detect it as an orbiting object; it is large enough to be found. Can you confirm or refute this guess?   And if the automobile can be found as an orbiting object, could it then be determined that this is not an ordinary space rock, but that there is something very odd about it? That is to say: is it possible to do any kind of characterisation of the automobile that makes it stand out as an unusual space object. There is some uncertainty about the exact state of the automobile after such a long time, but there is no question that chemically and optically, this will be no space rock, even in several thousand years. The question is if we can detect that.   Digging some more I found about the (re)discovery of J002E3, which turned out to (probably) be the Apollo 12 Saturn-IVB upper stage. I quote from this paper (emphasis mine):      Additional spectral observations were completed in May 2003 at the Air Force Maui Optical Supercomputing (AMOS) site. Through the modeling of common spacecraft materials, the observations of J002E3 show a strong correlation of absorption features to a combination of human-made materials including white paint, black paint, and aluminum. Absorption features in the near IR show a strong correlation with paint containing a titanium-oxide semiconductor.    So, in short: could we do the same with this automobile and find that this is not a plain old space rock? How close would it have to be for this?  "
728,"Concerning the ""Lithium test"" for Brown Dwarfs",Both low-mass PMS (pre-main-sequence) stars and young brown dwarfs can fuse lithium in their cores and the lithium can be depleted throughout the star/brown dwarf very quickly. Wiki. Then the Li I 6708A absorption line disappears from the object's spectrum.   Why and how can the Lithium test be used as an indicator to distinguish between young brown dwarfs and young low-mass stars?  Can somebody summarise in what cases we can tell whether an object is a brown dwarf or a low-mass star? 
729,Will the SKA's total bandwidth still exceed the Earth's internet's bandwidth?,"In the early 2010's there were many popular articles that said that the total bandwidth of the the Square Kilometer Array's optical fiber network for raw data from each dish would be larger than the Earth's internet. Here is just one example:  Wikipedia's Square Kilometre Array :     It would require very high performance central computing engines and long-haul links with a capacity greater than the global Internet traffic as of 2013.3   As you can see that link is broken.  The SKA project has several Precursors, pathfinders and design studies but the SKA proper has not been built yet, and perhaps is not even finalized.  Still, with available data, by the time it might be built (2025?) is it likely to still exceed the Earth's internet's bandwidth? "
730,What color is the Sky on other Planets?,"On Earth, the sky is blue.  What color would the sky be on other planets in our solar system? What about outside the solar system? Are there planets with purple skies, or green skies? Or are the all just blue? "
731,Why is TiO special?,"Red spectra of M stars are dominated by TiO(Titanium oxide) bands, which have become the primary means of establishing spectral types.see ApJ  Why is TiO special?   There should be much more Silicon elements than Titanium if we suppose the element abundance of M stars are similar to our sun.(Solar abundance is here). If similar，there should be much more SiO2 than TiO? "
732,"Tidally locked, and yet spinning?","Reading about Uranus almost 90° tilt, I was wondering if some rocky planet with mass concentration at one pole could possibly spin around its own axis, while still being locked to its star? Which means the more massive pole always points toward the star? "
733,Strange speck of light in the picture sequence of the approach to 2014 Mu69 (Ultima Thule),"In the picture sequence which was taken by New Horizons during the approach to Ultima Thule on the 3rd of Dec there can be seen a speck of light in the lower left corner, not as bright as 2014 MU69 but clearly visible.   Source: Here (German) or here (English), NASA / Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory / Southwest Research Laboratory / Henry Throop  Is there any theory what may have caused this signal? A particle from the probe itself, coincidentally passing in front of the lens? A variable star? A small object in the right distance and angle to be glimpsed upon by New Horizons? I think the latter would be an astronomically improbable event...  Here are some single frames of that image sequence, the speck is clearly visible on the 3rd of December.   "
734,Where might astrometric observations of the Roadster spacecraft be catalogued?,"  above: (see small red lines near center of image) Tesla Roadster. 18 Feb. 2018, 11:28 UT. The image above comes from the average of ten, 300-seconds exposures, remotely taken with the 16”-f/3.75 robotic unit (“Pearl”) of Tenagra Observatories in Arizona. The Tesla Roadster is marked with two red lines. At the imaging time, the car was about 3.5 millions of km from the Earth, that is 9 lunar distances. The object was at mag. 21.0. Image by Gianluca Masi (The Virtual Telescope Project) and Michael Schwartz (Tenagra Observatories, Ltd). From Virtual Telescope Project.  below: Zoomed in and cropped showing Roadster's image.      This excellent answer from @MikeG shows exactly how to find a list of observations for a minor planet. But I'd like to ask about a list of observations of an artificial object.  Currently the NASA JPL's Horizons site is also providing predicted trajectory of an unusual spacecraft which is referred to as Roadster. It is the cherry-red Tesla Roadster attached to a roughly 3.6 x 8 meter white rocket body in heliocentric orbit, and it has been tracked by many different observatories because of its unique circumstances. (some GIFs in this answer) Roadster's 4.6 minute rotational period was also recently reported.  Currently Horizons is reporting solution #7. They have been updating their solutions regularly as new observations are made and reported because as Roadster recedes from Earth it is rapidly dimming and will soon pass magnitude +20, so each new solution helps for the reacquisition of the object as it dims.     This trajectory is based on JPL solution #7, a fit to 269 ground-based optical astrometric measurements spanning 2018 Feb 8.2 to 13.4.   Would these observations still be catalogued in an astronomical database of observations? Since it's not a natural minor planet, it seems the Minor Planet Center would not be hosting this information, but it seems it should still be made available to astronomers for identification purposes.  But where?      The header of the Horizons output includes this:  ******************************************************************************* Revised: Feb 13, 2018          Tesla Roadster (spacecraft)             -143205           (solution #7)   Tesla Roadster (AKA: Starman, 2018-017A)   and this:  TRAJECTORY:   This trajectory is based on JPL solution #7, a fit to 269 ground-based    optical astrometric measurements spanning 2018 Feb 8.2 to 13.4.

735,Universe isn't infinite theory,"Forgive me if any of my terminology is off I am no physicist but I have wondered about this question for a while.  I have read in various books that if the universe was infinite, and uniformly created the whole sky would be white. This is because in every possible location in the sky there would be a star emitting light. Sort of like pixels, filling a screen.  I thought about this and wondered, doesn't this therefore imply that light is never absorbed by another medium?  What if a distant stars light is absorbed, therefore never reaching earth, giving the illusion that there are less stars? "
736,How to calculate luminosity in g-band from absolute AB magnitude and luminosity distance?,"How can I calculate the (non-bolometric) luminosity [tex] of a galaxy (or a star for that matter) over a given band from its AB apparent magnitude [tex] over that band and its luminosity distance [tex]?  For instance, consider the g-band which typically has a [tex] and a [tex]. Given this galaxy has an apparent AB magnitude of [tex] and luminosity distance of [tex] (i.e. [tex] if you are curious), what is its luminosity? I know I shold use the following equation, but I don't know what value to pick for [tex].  [tex]  I tried 5.12 from a website which is the value of [tex] in g-band but it gives me a different answer compared to when I calculate luminosity using flux:  [tex]  where [tex] is flux density and [tex] is the frequency width of the band (this is an approximation to the integration over frequency, assuming bands are step functions). So, how can I find luminosity using absolute magnitude?  Please provide your references. "
737,How are people converting intensities in Janskys to Kelvin?,"I'm reading some ALMA proposals and I am often seeing a conversion from Jy to Kelvin when, for example, people quote noise levels or source flux.  For example on their sensitivity calculator ([website]What's happening under the hood here? And why does their documentation treat sensitivities entered in Kelvin differently from when they're entered in Jy? Is this an interferometry thing?  Thanks "
738,Regarding the age / size of the Universe,"I believe the current estimated age of the Universe is around 14 billion years.  I just read in another post on here that the diameter of the Universe is around 90 billion light years.  This doesn't make sense to me, shouldn't the radius of the Universe be equal to it's age?  Unless the explosion caused particles to spread out faster than the speed of light? Is that possible? I thought the speed of light was a speed limit that nothing can exceed?  Sorry if there is something I'm not understanding here or if I'm trying to compare apples to oranges.  I'm only an astronomy enthusiast. "
739,Why doesn't a singularity spin infinitely fast?,"A question for a random reader passing through: because of the nature of things spinning faster when it gets smaller, wouldn't a singularity spin infinitely fast as it's infinitely small, if it has a spinn from the beginning that is? Btw I know what a ""ringularity"" but does it automaticly become one when rotational velocity is added? Is it just ""fake news""? "
740,What would a black hole merger look like?,"Ship 1 is out side the black hole. Ship 2 is nearing a black hole. To ship 1 it would appear that ship 2 would be moving slower to the point it would seem like ship 2 stopped moving the closer to the black hole ship 2 gets.  I imagine that 2 naked black hole(an infinity dense point with out a surrounding black hole) merging would look like a blur from the speed of them, but and because of the time dilatation is this gif picture below a good rendering of how the merger would appear to ship 1? Then how fast does a black hole move when merging??   "
741,How do solar winds affect the atmospheric composition and density of planets?,"Here is a bit of a newbie question, if you please.   The sun is constantly ejecting small particles via solar winds that come into contact with planets and other objects in our solar system. Do these particles contribute to the planets's atmospheres? Or do they do more harm than good? (define: good = contribute).  Do solar winds contain any larger atoms than helium. For instance, Oxygen?   My intuition on this issue is mixed since we have Mars with a very thin atmosphere, but Venus with a very thick atmosphere, neither having a very strong magnetosphere to protect them from solar winds. "
742,Why are black holes that massive?,"Today known most massive star, R136a1  weighs approximately 256 times the mass of our sun, how did supermassive black holes, with a mass of 10 billion times the sun form?  I understand, that when a star becomes black hole, its density increases, but does its mass also grow? "
743,Do integer multiples occur in astronomy data?,"I'm a statistics student, currently working on ""quantum inference"", which is the statistical problem of inference in the quantum model:  [tex]  which is similar to a simple linear model, except instead of [tex] being a known constant, it is instead a random integer. The prototypical example is von Mises's analysis of atomic weights in 1918, trying to assess the significance of the observation that they tended to be integer multiples of the mass of hydrogen. For more information on the subject see DG Kendall's overview.  I am not sure if I should continue working on this problem because the applications are so few, mostly in archaeology, where weights or lengths are often integer multiples of an ancient unit of measure. However, it occurred to me that there may be applications in astronomy.  For example, perhaps the brightness of a spot has been measured, and the spot could represent any number of objects which are not distinguishable at the present resolution. This could be a problem of quantum inference... but only if if were for some reason known a priori that all objects had to have the same brightness.  So, while that specific scenario might be implausible, is there some problem in astronomy data analysis that involves quantum inference in this sense? In other words, are there ever cases where a histogram of the data shows multiple, equally spaced modes? "
744,Infrared Region Telescopes,Why do we need to build telescopes that can view in the infrared? What exactly do we need to see in the infrared region? I know this seems like a really broad question but I'm just curious about it.  
745,Could the Sun's bending of light be measured on photographic plates before Einstein's prediction?,"It was predicted from Newtonian physics already in the 18th century that gravity should bend light, but not by as much as general relativity predicts. This was first confirmed during a solar eclipse in 1919. Surely, solar eclipses were imaged long before that. Didn't anyone notice that stars near the Sun were displaced? Hadn't anyone thought of testing the newtonian prediction of bent light? "
746,K-Pg asteroid impact,"Is it possible to determine what daytime the Chicxulub impactor striked the Earth 66 mya? Was it day or night, what was the current phase of the Moon etc.? Can sediments, rhytmites or something else hold this information? "
747,Do clouds on earth have an affect on a blood moon to the naked eye?,"I was watching the blood moon with a perfectly clear night- using only my naked eyes. At such a micro level, is it possible that all the shimmer I saw was an artefact of our atmosphere or just my poor eyes being the apeture? It basically had the look of a dark flame upon the moon- flickering.  My assumption was that the suns rays could be being attenuated through varied atmospheric densities causing a flickering effect. What is really happening?  Note... I wanted to observe it closer but snow and -9 degree weather prevented it. Bad to bring my telescope out in that. Also sorry for the shorthand. On mobile as well. "
748,Is our universe stable or metastable?,"I've been reading and thinking about this subject for some time, but I can't seem to find a clear answer.  After reading Q14:      Aspects of the Higgs boson suggest that our Universe is only   “marginally stable,” or is perhaps in a transition phase to a more   stable state that would result in a universe with fundamentally   different properties.   And this article:      With the discovery of the Higgs field, one question we can ask is   whether the Universe as a quantum system it is in a stable, low-energy   state, or in a metastable higher energy state?   According to the standard model of particle physics, the answer depends upon the masses of the top quark and the Higgs boson. The more massive the Higgs boson, the more likely the Universe is to be stable. The more massive the top quark, the more likely the Universe is to be metastable, or even unstable. From our current measurements of the top and Higgs masses, it seems that our Universe is metastable.  Maybe an answer already been found, but I just didn't find it, or am I not on the right level.   Is our universe stable or metastable? "
749,Jupiter-Venus conjunction is vertically aligned. I'm at 49° N. How is this possible?,"The very beautiful Jupiter Venus conjunction of ~ 2019-01-20 (practically something out of ""2001 A Space Odyssey"") is seen as ""vertically aligned"" in the dawn sky, Venus ""above"" Jupiter.   See this picture by Jeff Majewski at EarthSky.com to see what I mean (not sure I can copy it in here directly)  This should mean my ""vertical"" is aligned with the Ecliptic. I'm in northern latitudes (49° N), how is that possible?  And is this alignment geometrically linked with the ""Super Wolf Blood Moon"" which was very visible at the same time?  Update  The problem seems hard to explain so here is a little free-hand drawing.    The observer sits on the equator and is just being moved into sunlight by Earth's rotation (the image shows Winter Time for the Northern Hemisphere). The observer's ""UP"" vector lies in the Ecliptic Plane. This being so, and Jupiter and Venus also being in the Ecliptic Plane, the observer can see Jupiter and Venus aligned ""vertically"" (same azimuth), separated by a couple of degrees in elevation. As the day progresses, that vertical alignment will evidently cease as the line connecting the planets rotates relative to the observer.  This works on the Equator, but what if the observer is at higher latitudes? I can't get my head around the idea that the planets can be vertically aligned while still being on the Ecliptic Plane. "
750,Central temperature of a stellar model with combination of gas and degeneracy,"If we have a stellar density model [tex], where the star is composed of ions behaving as perfect gas and electron with non-relativistic degeneracy. The central pressure is due to both gas and degeneracy pressure. My final goal is to find central temperature of this model.  Now for the linear density model, I calculated the central pressure only for gas to be [tex]. And central temperature for only gas is [tex]  I know the Pressure for non-relativistic degeneracy [tex]. I was wondering to find central pressure for degeneracy, may I use the Lane-Emden equations for polytrops and simply find central pressure and temperature from there? Then add the two temperatures to find the maximum central temperature for a gas+degenerate star.  For Lane-Emden model, they also consider density dependence on radial distance, but they express the density function as [tex]. Is it equivalent to [tex] for gas model? "
751,How can a low-mass star increase its mass to 1.4 Msun?,"In my astronomy class I learned that a only low-mass stars (&lt; 0.5 Msun) will contract, and then become degenerate, until it is a white dwarf. However, we also learned about the Chandrasekhar limit, which states white dwarfs have a maximum mass of 1.4 Msun.   If the starting star has less than 0.5 Msun, how does the resulting white-dwarf reach up to 1.4 Msun?  Am I perhaps wrong in my assumption that the mass of the resulting white-dwarf depends on the mass of the original star? "
752,Is dark matter influenced by gravity of baryonic matter?,"As far as I know galaxies and clusters form along so-called ""galactic filaments"" which are influenced by a dark matter web that organises them in to this position in the universe. So it looks like dark matter attracts baryonic matter by a kind of gravity. But is it also true the other way around, and that 'our' mass has gravitational forces on dark matter? And if not why does it only go one way?  In a study scientists have observed the four colliding galaxies of cluster Abell 3827 and discovered that one of the envelopes of dark matter in the galaxy behind it encloses. The backlog in the system stands at 5,000 light years (50,000 million million kilometers - the NASA space probe Voyager would do 90 million years to cover that distance. Expected to create some lag between a galaxy and its associated dark matter when dark matter affects itself, however small, by other forces than the gravity.   See also [website][website]"
753,"What do the acronyms in ""AT 2017 gfo"" mean?","About 11 hours after the detection of GW170817 by Ligo/Virgo and the quickly succeeding detected GRB170817, a transient afterglow in the optical-nIR frequency appeared which showed many signs of r-process nucleosynthesis. This transient was given the identification AT 2017 gfo.     ""SSS17a, now with the IAU identification of AT 2017 gfo""   My questions are simple. What do the acronyms ""AT"" and ""gfo"" mean? And for that matter, what does the acronymn ""SSS"" stand for? I tried to do a quick search through the IAU website but all I could find were general instructions on how to come up with your own astronomical identifier. I suspect ""AT"" means astronomical transient, but I can not confirm.  "
754,How does the size of a naked black hole effect its photon sphere?,"What effect does the size of a black hole have on the size or density of the photon sphere and it's proximity to the horizon?   For example: A person is in space looking at 2 black holes, one of them big and the other small. Could the bigger one appear smaller because of the way space bends around it?   If yes, can a large enough black hole be completely hidden behind the gravitational lensing? Could a dense photon sphere around a black hole look like a spherical distortion to distort the horizon or hide the black hole completely?   "
755,Why do most of the myths behind constellations originate from Greek?,"Why do most of the myths regarding constellations happen to have begun from Greek civilization? Why not other civilizations?   Most people who lived in the past era probably observed star patterns in the sky and created their own constellation myths.     Also, I would like to know more about some of the stories regarding the myths of those constellations.  "
756,Why do comets appear to have a continuous supply of dust?,"Comets orbiting the sun have a tail that points away from the Sun, due to the solar wind.   (Strictly speaking, a comet can have both a type I tail - ion tail, and a type II tail - a dust tail. This question is about the type II tail - the dust tail).   Now I understand that some of the source of the dust is volatile materials in the comet oxidising due to the comet's proximity to the sun. But surely some of these comets have been orbiting for hundreds of thousands of years (if not millions). Why do they still have unspent fuel? Why are they still dusty? Hasn't all the dust blown off by now?  My question is: Why do comets appear to have a continuous supply of dust? "
757,Dark matter inertial mass,"We know the existence of dark matter because we can test its gravitational mass (e.g. in gravitational lens) but, since we cannot see this matter, how we can be sure that it has an inertial mass, and it is the same as the gravitational mass? In other words, does the principle of equivalence apply also to dark matter? "
758,"Would a spacecraft just go ""through"" a gas giant?","From my understanding of the word gas giant, it is a planet composed of entirely a gaseous atmosphere, and so planets Jupiter and onwards fall in this category.   That being said, what would stop a spacecraft from just going right through any of these planets?  For earth, a spacecraft would firstly rapidly disintegrate approaching the surface of earth, and if it happens to still have part of itself, it will collide with the surface.  For gas giants like Uranus, if a spacecraft is able to counter the gravitational forces and slow down, could it actually ""go through"" Uranus? "
759,"Why do we need the ""mean"" in mean free path?","I was introduced to mean free path in my astro physics class,  and the professor posts a question for us to ponder: ""Why do we need the ""mean"" in mean free path?""  This further makes me to wonder what is the mean free path for, and how is it used? "
760,Can you simulate artificial gravity by using an electromagnetic field?,"If you create a electromagnetic field under a surface could you then create artificial gravity effect by wearing magnetized clothing and shoes?   Or could you bombard objects that you want to experience gravitational forces with artificial gravitons or graviolis? Or inject or drink a ferrofluid (non-toxic) like that used in rocket fuel?      A ferrofluid (portmanteau of ferromagnetic and fluid) is a liquid that   becomes strongly magnetized in the presence of a magnetic field. A   grinding process for ferrofluid was invented in 1963 by NASA's Steve   Papell as a liquid rocket fuel that could be drawn toward a pump inlet   in a weightless environment by applying a magnetic field.      [website]What I mean is create the forces of attraction and then make the objects you want to attract attractive, obviously.  This is as opposed to using other methods such as acceleration or centrifugal or centripetal force (or in addition to it).  "
761,"Angles in Moon, Earth and Sun system","Consider the vector positions of the center of mass of Moon, Sun and Earth, [tex], [tex], [tex], respectively, in a given reference frame.   Consider:   the angle between the vector [tex] and [tex], the angle between the vector [tex] and [tex], the angle between the vector [tex] and [tex].      Does any of these angles have a name in astronomy, or can be important for some specific reasons? If so, may you please give me some general indications of why this is the case, and point to some references?  "
762,How does gravity really work,"I am only 12 years old and I'm constantly wondering and trying understand how gravity really works. On YouTube everyone always talks about objects warping space time around themselves and uses the analogy of a trampoline. I still don't understand gravity because if space were like a trampoline, then earth would be spiraling in towards the sun along with all the other planets, right? So could someone explain to me how gravity really works without the trampoline analogy? "
763,When will the last total solar eclipse occur?,"Because the moon distance from earth grows, how long will it take, that it is no longer possible to see a total eclipse but only circular eclipses? And does it make a difference if you are on the mount everest or on sea level? "
764,Laser Collimator For Dobsonian vs Newtonian,"Will a laser collimator like the Gosky 1.25 Metal Laser Collimator, [website]"
765,Which of Jupiter's moons did I most likely see?,"I was gazing through my binoculars at Jupiter last night and noticed 3 (maybe 4) tiny dots in line with it. A first I thought they might have been background stars but quickly realised their colour was similar to that of Jupiter and their brightness was larger than expected considering their size. As a result, I'm pretty certain I was looking at Jupiter's moons.  Presumably, I was seeing the largest of its moons (Io, Europa, Ganymede, Callisto). They were far too tiny to see any details, obviously, but would it have been only those moons I could see? I assume the rest are too small. And is seeing those 4 moons as tiny bright dots through my 7x50s feasible? "
766,Can the Keck Observatory be improved with a third telescope?,Can the Keck Observatory resolution be improved by adding a third telescope? I imagine that that would be cheaper than building a completely new telescope? 
767,What star system/Galaxy did LIGO observe the gravity wave?,"Are there any coordinates for the Black Hole system, or galaxy for which the LIGO observations, observed the gravity wave? Any coordinates of the black hole system for which the gravity wave signal has been observed?  "
768,Life in sufficiently hot rogue planets,"The Milky Way has a bright center we can't see directly because of space dust. Are there's regions of the galaxy free of that dust that could receive all that light and radiation, right? Would it be possible to exist an 'ecosphere' around the galaxy's center where planets receive as much energy from it as the Earth receive from the Sun? Would it be possible to rogue planets orbiting the galaxy's center at that distance to sustain life?  Or it's the case that interstelar dust always blocks most energy? Even in a 'polar orbit' around the galaxy's center?  If so, how many of them could exist? More than planets orbiting stars?  "
769,How strong is the gravitational stretch we experience from the edge of the universe?,"How much gravitational effect do we experience (e.g. maybe -.00001 G or smaller) from the edge of the visible universe?  By edge of the visible universe, I am talking about the region of the cosmic microwave background and beyond.  In the past, the universe was very hot and dense, and we are seeing the light from this time period as the Cosmic Microwave Background.  It took slightly less than the age of the universe for that light to reach us, and it has become extremely redshifted with the expansion of space.  Since gravity apparently travels at the speed of light, we should be experiencing a gravitational effect from this shell around us as well.  As I understand, the universe was extremely dense back then, and it is around us in every direction, which would intensify the gravity greatly.  However, it is extremely distant, which would weaken the gravity greatly.  I don't know if redshift would affect gravity as it has the light from the cosmic microwave background, but if so, this would weaken the effect greatly as well.  With all this in mind, I am curious, what would be the effect of gravity from the edge of the universe on us?  Note: I would expect this to be a very small outward effect in all directions, something like -.00000001 g or something like that, but not 0. "
770,Is there a maximum temperature a planet can have?,"This may sound a little bit confusing, but I will try to explain. (I have done research on this topic already)  I have looked at the temperatures of planets and I was wondering, is there a point where a planet is at perigee and it's temperature cannot reach any higher? Let's just say the planet is tidally locked, and is currently at perigee. Would the planet be at a point where it's temperature can no longer be increased at the current distance from its star? "
771,What affects the evolution curve of a star's luminosity as a function of time?,"Take a star of a given mass (say [tex] or [tex]), what affects the star's luminosity as a function of time and how much? (metallicity?, rotation?)  It seems to me that stellar evolution is basically set by the laws of physics; if we know certain parameters (e.g., mass). Of course, that's the trick since we can't directly measure the mass of a star with no companion(s).  I have run across a few issues with published values being in conflict. For example, this study gives the age of Zeta Tucanae as being about [tex]. However, mass/radius/luminosity is given as 0.99/1.08/1.26 relative to sun (Wikipedia sources). If you look at an evolutionary plot of the Sun something is wrong here. (I'm guessing mass.) By the way [Fe/H] is given as -0.18. "
772,What are the lines in this Solar Cycle graph?,What do the lines in this NASA graphic represent?  Why does Solar cycle 22 have a peak of nearly 300 (assuming that peak represents the maximum observations at the same time) and this link says the peak is 212)?   
773,Movement of the stars relative to my position,"I live in the Pacific North West (Washington State, US). I have watched the skies for years, looking for constellations that I recognize and keeping track of them. One of them is Orion. As I have watched Orion I noticed that it travels East to West as I look to the south. It traverses the line that is the Milkey Way...   My question is. If the stars that make up the constellation of Orion move East to West from my position, looking up and South. Why does the Milky Way seem to stay in the same position? How is it that the stars that make up Orion move but the stars that make up the milky way appear to be fixed?  Thank you in advance for any input. "
774,"What does the word ""compact"" mean in astronomy/astrophysics?","I have seen countless times the adjective ""compact"" in astronomy, e.g. compact stars, compact binaries, etc. I would like to know, what exactly is this supposed to mean? From this source, I am led to believe that ""compact"" is meant to denote objects of the greatest matter densities in the universe, i.e. white dwarfs, neutron stars, and black holes. Is this correct? "
775,Can I slice off a piece of the Sun?,"Bear with me. I want to explain this to my 6 and half year old.  If, all things being equal, we could reach out to the Sun with a suitable implement, a gigantic space knife, could we cut a piece off the Sun? Take a slice from it? Do we end up with a body of Hydrogen and Helium, or is it impossible to extract anything from it?  I know that the Sun is a massive ball of plasma, the sheer mass compressing the gas through gravity until fusion is achieved. What I have been asked is, effectively, what happens if you try to take a piece of that plasma? Of our sun?  "
776,Gravitational field released during supernovae,"During the collapse of a star at the commencement of supernovae, the intense pressures force fusion and fission to create the heavier elements and release vast amounts of energy. As this energy/mass is released - the gravitational field must also decrease in an instant, and as this ""Warping of space time"" is instantly released and returns to flat space (Or flatter space) - does this create or contribute to the explosion of the supernovae itself? I have always been puzzled by the concept of the collapsed outer layers ""Bouncing off of an in-compressible core"" as the source of the explosion. Isn't this instantaneous ""Relaxation of the curvature of the space"" not what we see as the explosion? "
777,Do other planets affect the Earth?,"Let say Mercury, Venus, the Moon were all in alignment between the Earth and Sun. They are all closest to each other in respective elliptical orbit.  On the other side of the Sun you have the rest of the planets.   Would their gravity combine to have any gravitational effects on the Earth? Or are they all too far away? "
778,Effect of Hot/Warm Jupiter atmosphere loss on other planets,"Let us suppose a solar system with a Hot/Warm Jupiter HJ (with a semi-major axis somewhere from 0.5 AU to 0.0001 AU) and an Earth-Like planet EL in it (with a semi-major axis of about 1 AU). Let their orbital inclinations be a couple of degrees apart. Let the star be a G2V or so, like our Sun.  According to this and other sources, we can tell that Hot Jupiters are ""bleeding"" atmosphere due to their proximity to their sun. Some of it, I presume, gets pushed out with the solar wind farther out into the solar system, at least as far as the EL is.   What effect will this bled atmosphere from HJ have on EL, if any? If there is an effect, when does it happen? On all of EL's orbit, despite the different inclinations? Only when EL crosses a transit node? Only when there's a transit (or rather, when EL passes through the transit node a certain amount of time after HJ does, to account for the velocity of the atmospheric particles through space)? Will this bled atmosphere be (naked-eye) visible from EL? What would it look like? Would all of this have any effect on life/civilization on the EL?  "
779,Does the Sun's light travel fast enough to have a straight path to Earth?,"Hopefully this question isn't too silly.  When we travel through space, we use a curved path following an orbit to reach our destinations.   As far as I'm aware, we could take a more straight line approach but it would require much more deltaV (both in reaching the speed and in slowing down when reaching the target to be captured.)    However the path would still be slightly curved because of the curvature of space and because of orbital tracjectory when leaving Earth.  Does the light escaping the Sun move fast enough to follow a straight line path until it hits Earth, or is it curved in those 8 minutes?  What about to somewhere further like Pluto? "
780,Reasons for orbital inclinations,"I see that there was already about Pluto's orbital inclination, but I would like to ask a more general question.  Why do planets have orbital inclinations?  And is there any particular reason, other than chance, for Mercury's inclination being so small?  Thank you! "
781,Are there any galaxies which fell out of sight horizon due to cosmic expansion?,"If farthest galaxies run away from us with acceleration making them exceed speed of light, we should expect them to disappear from sky among time with increasing quantity. Did we observe this? Can we indicate next galaxies to eliminate and their time of decline?  My question concerns galaxies moving with all speed ranges, not only ones greater than speed of light. "
782,How strong is the gravity from half of the distant universe?,"I would like to know, how strong would the gravity be from the distant universe if we were somehow able to remove half of it.  For example, if everything behind us did not exist, how strongly would the stuff in front of us be pulling?  By distant, let us consider everything beyond 10 billion light years (e.g. remove all the closer stuff).  How many G's acceleration would I experience (discounting the fact that I would be in free fall and wouldn't feel it)? "
783,How can the equation of state for cosmic strings and domain walls be derived?,"In this article which nicely explains why it is really the quantity [tex] which is relevant to determine if the expansion of the universe is accelerating or decelerating by making use of the for this question relevant second Friedmann equation  $$ \frac{\ddot{a}}{a} = -\frac{4\pi G}{3}(\rho + 3p) $$  it is mentioned that for cosmic strings   $$ p = -\frac{\rho}{3} $$  which has the effect that they dont contribute to the ""non-inertial"" expansion of the universe, and for cosmic domain walls we have  $$ p = -\frac{2 \rho}{3}  $$  which leads to an accelerated expansion of the universe.  Whereas I understand the derivations of such equations of state for radiation, ""ordinary"" matter, and a constant source of dark energy, I have not yet seen analog calculations for cosmic strings and domain walls.  So how can the equation of states for topological defects such as cosmic strings and cosmic domain walls be derived? "
784,How do we know background radiation does not come from undiscovered galaxies?,"Each year while observing voids, astronomers discover more and more unexpected galaxies within them.     How do we know the cosmic microwave background radiation is not the weak light from distant galaxies?  How do we know cosmic microwave background radiation is not stars' light reflected by dark objects?  "
785,How does a Bahtinov mask work?,"For focusing the image of a telescope, one can use a Bahtinov mask. How does this mask work, and how did Mr Bahtinov get the idea to cut such a peculiar shape? Is it possible for me to design my own focusing masks? "
786,Is there a connection between Jupiter's orbital period and the Sun's solar cycles?,"The cycle of solar maximums and solar minimums are each about 11 years, which is close to the orbital period of Jupiter. I thought it was a numerical coincidence, until google turned up some results of a possible connection. A lot of it is beyond my head though.   I was under the impression that there are gaps in our knowledge regarding Jupiter's core, which would likely be the driver of its magnetic field. And since solar cycles are related to sunspot activity, which in turn is related to the magnetic field of the Sun, I am struggling to find even a basic understanding of the cause-effect relationship (if there is one).   Is there a connection between Jupiter's orbital period and the Sun's solar cycles? Or is it blind speculation? "
787,Are there events in universe which we receive first from their neutrino's instead of their photons?,"Neutrino's are very small though they have mass. Because of that it is probably that the don't have a speed faster than photons.  But is it in all events, like supernova's or else events, where it is possible that we first receive their neutrino's instead of their light?   Perhaps gravity or other interactions could change something in their way to earth? "
788,Can I see comet ISON from Saudi Arabia?,"I live in western Saudi Arabia, I am trying to see the comet ISON, reading here and there tells that I can see it by naked eye somewhere next to the constellation leo, I used an app to tells me where constellation leo is but I could not see the comet.   Is it visible from Saudi Arabia? if so, in which direction (west, east, etc.) and what time is the best to see it? "
789,Could mirrors be replaced with CCDs?,"Why do telescopes use mirrors that simply reflect photons, when they instead could be covered with large sensors to register them? Reflection is all good and well, all thanks to silver and beryllium for that. But wouldn't it be better to electronically register the photons directly instead of after having them bounce around between stupid mirrors? Would any data be lost in a pure CCD-telescope without any mirrors or lenses?  Couldn't a large wired CCD light sensor send the detected signals further in a smarter way than a stupid physically reflecting surface can do? It's the same photons and the telescope itself doesn't generate any new information about the distant galaxies it reflects. Why physically bend mirrors for adaptive optics, instead of bending the raw binary data with an algorithm for the same effect? "
790,"Years, months, days, and ... weeks?",Why do we divide time into weeks?  Is there any celestial reason why humans do this?     one year: earth revolution around the sun  one month: moon revolution around the earth  one week: 7 days = ???  one day: earth rotation about its axis  
791,How much mass will the Sun have when it becomes a white dwarf?,"In 4 billion years, when our Sun sheds all of its outer gas layers and turns into a white dwarf, how much mass will the white dwarf have compared to what the sun has today?  Will the planets still orbit in the same way, or will the reduced mass cause the planets' trajectories to change, so that they eventually leave the solar system? "
792,Which telescope to choose and some general questions,"I'm playing with the idea to buy a telescope for years now and finally decided to do so. There are two which I consider:   The Celestron NexStar 127 SLT Mak and the Celestron NexStar 130 SLT  I already know the difference between a Refractor and Maksutov-Cassegrain and for which observations they're suited for best (and also that the Mak doesn't need collimating).  First question: Which would be the better choice for a beginner and eventually astrophotography?  Second question: Is it possible to buy just the tube later (so I can reuse the motors and the tripod)?  Third question: As I've read, the tripod is pretty wobbly, so is it possible to replace the tripod later on (or is there a norm for the mounts)? "
793,Can we find rocks from Venus or Mercury on Earth?,"As we know, we can find rocks from Mars on Earth, how about Venus and Mercury? Is that not found yet? Or it is impossible to find them because they are closer to the Sun, and debris won't go far away from the Sun? "
794,Is Jupiter's rotation slowing?,"According to Wikipedia, re Europa's tidal flexing:     the tidal flexing kneads Europa's interior and gives it a source of   heat, possibly allowing its ocean to stay liquid while driving   subsurface geological processes.The ultimate source of this energy is   Jupiter's rotation, which is tapped by Io through the tides it raises   on Jupiter and is transferred to Europa and Ganymede by the orbital   resonance.   [website]Does this imply that Jupiter's rotation is slowing over time, since it is losing energy due to raising tides on Io?  (Or just generally, does raising tides cause rotation to slow?) "
795,What exactly is it that is being magnified 50 times in this gravitational lensing observation?,"In the Los Angeles Times news item Scientists get a rare view of a type Ia supernova magnified 50 times what exactly is magnified 50 times?   This supernova is really very far away. Is it somehow imaged by the gravitational lensing and being resolved — the actual supernova itself?  edit: I believe this is it, but it's behind a paywall (will confirm in due course): [website]above: From the Los Angeles Times. Photo credit: Joel Johansson    above: ""This schematic image represents how light from a distant galaxy is distorted by the gravitational effects of a nearer foreground galaxy, which acts like a lens and makes the distant source appear distorted, but brighter, forming characteristic rings of light, known as Einstein rings.

796,"Stellar systems: what is the difference between virial, dynamical and thermodynamic equilibrium?","I'm currently going through Binney &amp; Tremaine (2008) on my own to learn about stellar dynamics. I also have been perusing additional online resources such as this scholarpedia wiki.   Often when distinguishing between collision-less vs collisional stellar systems, the virial theorem is invoked along with the equations for ""crossing time"" (also known as ""dynamical time"") and ""relaxation time."" A large galaxy is said to be collision-less because its relaxation time is many orders of magnitude higher than its age, whereas a dense stellar system (e.g., a globular cluster) is collisional because its relaxation time is less than its age.   But what is the relationship between this so-called ""relaxed"" state and virial, dynamical, and thermodynamic equilibrium? What do the three different kinds of equilibria intuitively mean?   For example, I have heard that large galaxies are assumed to be in virial equilibrium and then people derive ""dynamical masses"" (why not ""virial masses""?). What would it take and/or mean for a large elliptical galaxy to be not just in virial equilibrium, but also in dynamical or thermodynamic equilibrium? "
797,Changes to Earth's orbit,"Any time a spacecraft comes in close proximity to a planet and if the spacecraft has the right angle then it is able to use the planet's velocity to move itself further into space.  According to Newton's 3rd law: every action has an equal reaction.  In this case when the spacecraft uses for example the Earth's gravity to speed up, Earth will move towards the spacecraft. Earth's orbital change will be very small because the spacecraft's mass is small compared to Earth's mass but what if a big asteroid comes in close proximity or what if we use Earth's gravity to catapult our spacecrafts and keep doing it for an extended period of time.  What could happen in this case? Could that have a dramatic impact to Earth's orbit? "
798,Do planetary rings have geometric bounds?,"Are there any bounds on where a planetary ring can form and maintain orbit relative to the planet?  Do they have to be in a circular equatorial orbit?  Is there a min or max altitude, say with respect to the Roche limit, geosynchronous orbit, or other points in space? "
799,Does the given radius of a planet/moon include its atmosphere?,"In NASA fact sheets, such as this one for Venus, a radius of the planet is given.  Is that radius the radius of the surface of the planet, or of the envelope of atmosphere?  Put another way, if calculating the angular diameter of a planet/moon from a location, do I only have to look up this radius, or do I have to look up this radius along with the atmosphere height to determine the angular diameter? "
800,Can it be inferred that our cosmological horizon has increased over time?,"If I am right, we can see only those stars that lie within our cosmological horizon, and there may or may not be any stars beyond that. Given last 150 years of using telescopes, and since then our cosmological horizon must have increased by about 150 light years, have we seen any new galaxies, stars? If given enough time, say 500 years, new stars are found, can we be sure they have become visible against not being formed, say, 150 years after big bang? "
801,Will Neptune be visible with the naked eye if I am standing on its satellite,"Assume that I am standing on one of the many satellites of Neptune. Will I be able to see the planet with my naked eyes (without any sort of visual aid).  If I was to stand on Moon I would be able to see the Earth because the light from Sun is reflected off Earth into my eyes and I am able to see Earth. In case of Neptune, the distance between Neptune and the Sun is so great that the sun would look like any other star (a bit brighter). In that case if I am looking at Neptune would I be able to see it ?  What about the other gas giants ? "
802,Is the Milky Way Visible from Nebraska?,"Is the Milky Way Visible from Nebraska?  If so, where is the best place to view it, and also what would be the best time of night to see it?  I know this is probably a very novice question, just trying to get a better understanding of what I can see.  If it helps, I'm south of Omaha. "
803,"Helium rain inside metallic hydrogen within Jupiter, conditions and experiments?","In response to today being pi day (also see [website]This year's NASA activity includes the problem set Helium Heist: A 'Pi in the Sky' Math Challenge. Below is a cropped screen shot of the illustration from this PDF version.  The part of the text that I found most striking is:     It has been hypothesized that the helium was depleted out of the upper atmosphere and transported deeper inside the planet. The extreme pressure inside Jupiter condenses helium into droplets that form inside a liquid metallic hydrogen layer below. Because the helium is denser than the surrounding hydrogen, the helium droplets fall like rain through the liquid metallic hydrogen.   Question: Roughly what are the pressure and temperature thought to be at this depth in Jupiter? Is this regime at all accessible experimentally on Earth to confirm that these two fluids are immiscible, or is this behavior purely theoretical?    below: cropped screen shot from here (NASA). Click for full size.   "
804,How would I measure that I'm at a pole?,"How would a person measure that he is at a planetary pole? My first inclination is to use a sextant to ensure that the Sun remains at a constant inclination. However, due to the orbit around the Sun and a possible planetary axial tilt, the Sun's inclination may vary over the course of the year and that could affect measurements if the length of the day is a significant portion of the length of the year.  A second inclination is to try to identify a pole star or at least the point about which distant stars rotate during the course of a planetary rotation. The observer could then (at least in theory) measure the inclination of this point assuming that planetary precession takes a long enough time (as on Earth). However, in the most likely chance that there is no bright star near the pole, I don't see how a sextant could measure reliably the inclination of a blank point.  Perhaps the first method could be used, but with other objects in the sky (stars) in place of the Sun. Thus, if a given star's inclination does not change as it (apparently) revolves around the horizon, we are at the pole.  Are there any better methods, assuming a completely self-contained system (i.e. no external satellites)? "
805,What happens if two or three stars collide with each other?,"After finding out that there is a solar system with three stars, I did extensive research. I couldn't get a definitive answer. What would happen if they collided with each other?  I know there would be total destruction everywhere, but I would like to know what, including more scientific short- and long- term effects, would happen?  If you can't explain three stars, two stars colliding would be okay. I'm still an amateur at astronomy, so please don't make the answer too complicated. "
806,Doesn't gravity attract objects in space until they collide?,If the formula to calculate the force of gravity between two objects is:  [tex]  why do planets stay in orbit? Or is there another formula at work?  
807,"If the density of nebular distribution increases symmetrically in all directions, how does space curvature explain it?","Edwin Hubble, in The Observational Approach to Cosmology, wrote     Thus the density of the nebular distribution increases outwards,   symmetrically in all directions, leaving the observer in a unique position. Such a favoured position, of course, is intolerable.   My first question is: do more recent observations still show a symmetrical nebulae density increase? Or did Hubble just do a miscalculation, misinterpretation of an observation etc.?  Apparently, Hubble can solve this problem with spatial curvature. Further below, he writes     Therefore, in order to restore homogeneity, and to escape the horror of a unique position, the departures from uniformity, which are introduced by the recession factors, must be compensated by the second term representing effects of spatial curvature. - There seems to be no other escape.   I understand how an expanding Universe explains the symmetrical redshift, but I fail to understand how it explains the symmetrical increase of nebulae density. "
808,What do we know about the lifecycle of the Milky Way (or any other spiral galaxy)?,I know that the Milky Way will collide with Andromeda in the distant future but my knowledge about the lifecycle of a galaxy is very lacking.   I was surprised that Wikipedia is so sparse on information in this topic. So how can I visualize its lifecycle? What will happen in the future?  FYI: I just found this very informative video on the topic. 
809,What happens over time as a neutron star cools?,"My understanding of a white dwarf star is that, although it hasn't happened yet due to the age of the universe, eventually as it loses energy due to radiating heat and tidal forces, it will cool to become a black dwarf - essentially a black ball of carbon.  What happens when a neutron star eventually cools? What is left, and do we know what it would look like? "
810,How are the photos of the Milky Way taken?,"We are inside the Milky Way, right? So, how are we able to take photos of the Milky Way? "
811,How could I determine what areas of the Milky Way will be visible?,"There is a new moon on Saturday, and the forecast in my area of Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada calls for clear skies on that night.  I would like to take a widefield astrophotograph.  I have no idea what areas of the milky way will be visible, and where they will be located.  What are some steps I could take to determine this?  Are there different dense (photogenic) portions of the milkyway visible at different times of the year?  Are there certain constellations associated with the dense portions of the milky way that I should be looking for?  I would like to further develop my knowledge of astronomy, for the purpose of widefield milkyway shots. "
812,Do moons have moons?,"Have we discovered any natural satellites of natural satellites of planets or dwarf planets? Even very small, or relatively short-lived - e.g. ringlets around Saturn's moons, some meteorites orbiting Jupiter moons, or something to orbit Charon? Or is the Star-Planets-Moons the deepest naturally ocurring orbital recursion level? "
813,Protocol for establishing longitudinal meridians on other heavenly bodies,"When we first observe a new heavenly body (it could be a new star, asteroid, etc.,or a minor planet in our own solar system), are there any procedures set in place for establishing a system of longitudinal meridians?   Being that a prime meridian is an arbitrary concept that you can pick and establish anywhere, is a location decided based on a physical feature, or perhaps from the first points of data we gathered when making detailed observations of the heavenly bodies for the first time?   What about heavenly bodies with no easily discernible or non-stationary features (Gas Giants)? Also does the IAU regulate this process?   I have always wondered if the USSR and the US shared common reference points for locations such as on the moon.  "
814,What are the reasons for referring to equinox J2000 or the equinox of the date?,"(Background: Trying to learn something about the mathematical and computational part of astronomy I have acquired a copy of Meeus' ""Astronomical Algorithms"" and implemented the material up to Chapter 33 in Java, with only one major sidestep: VSOP87, for which I obtained the full data set and ""translated"" the FORTRAN program.)  VSOP87 exhibits the reason for my question: you can compute rectangular/spherical heliocentric positions either for the reference frame J2000 or the one of the given date. Clearly, if I want to observe some planets tonight, I'll compute the data for today's equinox. On the other hand, there is the possibility of a transformation between equinoxes of different dates.  So why are these methods (here and for other methods, too) provided for both reference frames? Was it the (then) weaker computer performance?  Only a little later, iauPlan94 provides the result only for J2000 although Meeus in the chapter dedicated to the paper of J.L.Simon e.al. provides tables with data from their theory for J2000 and the equinox of the date.   What would be good reasons for today and the years to come to refer a computation to J2000?  "
815,Mars night sky -- Phobos and Deimos?,"I'm having a debate about how bright Martian nights would be, in terms of both the sky itself and ground illumination. This answer seems to indicate that the stars would be only dimly visible, and wouldn't provide enough light to see by. However, the question remains of how much illumination the moons would provide. I've seen it said that Deimos would appear about as bright as Venus does from Earth, and that Phobos would be about twenty times brighter, but it's not clear to me how that compares to e.g. our own moon's illumination. So how bright would it look? Would it be enough to see by? "
816,Stars in constellation patterns by catalogue number?,"I need a resource that can tell me the stars that make up a constellation (pattern), preferably by Henry Draper or some catalogue number? All i can find is lists of every star in a constellation (area) or incomplete lists of stars by name.  If this doesn't exist can you suggest a way to work it out myself?  "
817,Are all impact craters circular?,"I'm aware for over 100 years the reason has been known how impact craters are almost always circular, but my question really is has there been any recent insights in the area? What other topologies are physically possible?  "
818,How can the information encoded in a boundary be changed in holographic principle?,"When information is encoded in a boundary of a bulk, following the holographic principle, it would raise a universe in the boundary with physics determined by the information encoded on it.  My question is: Can this information (once encoded in the boundary) be modified or changed? Can it be modified without changing nothing in the bulk? "
819,Why the continued obsession in measuring the year as a multiple of days?,"Pick a any notion of year and any type of day measurement.  Outside of history and the common cycle of day an night, why are these viewed as integrally or even fractionally commensurate?  Why all the stunts with leap days and leap seconds, etc... when we now have atomic clocks?  These tricks seem like mathematical voodoo in the modern age.  Why not decouple the two and say that day X belongs to year Y if at 12:00 noon of that day is ""in"" year Y?  My point... what if we measured Neptune's orbital period as a multiple of Mercury's orbital period?  It would make about as much sense.  Yes, let's have leap mercury orbits and leap milli-mercury orbits.  Outside of historical considerations and the tangible nature of the day I think this analogy is exact.  We could have a calendar nearly identical to our own while decoupling the two time measurements.  Edit Comment How do you know what a year is without a calendar?  See, there you go again!  You measure a year in multiples of the smallest feasible, measurable unit.  In other words, you measure a year just like all the other durations in science.  Calendared time durations are the exception, not the rule... Uncoupling between two independent quantities is the rule, not the exception.  The intellectual exercise is how to make sense of falsely coupled time durations. "
820,What is the ultimate fate of a cluster of galaxies?,"We're fairly aware clusters of galaxies drift apart due to space expansion, which will drive them out of each other's cosmic event horizon eventually, leaving them separate, alone, each a single ""body"" within its local observable universe with no means to communicate or influence other clusters.  The clusters themselves are held together by gravitational binding that keeps them from being internally torn apart by space expansion, at least assuming density of dark energy doesn't increase drastically eventually.  What will happen to the cluster though? At first I assumed its black holes will swallow all its available matter, and connect into one single, lonely black hole. But then, neither are black holes ultimately eternal, due to Hawking Radiation, nor do they swallow all the stars, supposedly most stars escaping their gravity well.  Well then, what current theories say a local cluster of galaxies will transform into as t→∞ ? "
821,How are the world's biggest telescopes cleaned?,"How are the world's biggest telescopes, (such as the Very Large Telescope for example) cleaned?  My research includes what I have read about CO2 cleaning here. Are there any other ways to cleaning the mirrors? What if we were talking about the (cancelled) Overwhelmingly Large Telescope? "
822,What is the direction of a comet's dust tail before and after perihelion?,"I recently created a visualisation of comet ISON's orbit. However, I received a critique that the dust tail of the comet should be pointing away from the Sun after perihelion.  As far as I know, the ion tail of the comet definitely points away from the Sun as it is blown away by the solar wind.  I want to know what is the direction of the dust-tail of the comet, before and after the perihelion. Is it always trailing the path of the comet (to a fair degree of approximation) or are there other significant effects? "
823,Determining line ratios in planetary nebula,"I know that the line strength ratio tells us how hot the electron plasma in a nebula is, and also give information about the electron densities in the nebula. But how do you compute the line ratios? Say we consider two emission lines (both forbidden) decaying to the ground state. If I have the Einstein A coefficients and the statistical weights, how do I compute the line ratios? Any explanation (preferably with examples) will be highly appreciated. "
824,Does Hawking radiation in fact bring mass into the universe?,"As I understand virtual particles pairs, e.g. electron and positron spontaneously pop into existence for tiny period of time, then they annihilate.  When virtual electron and virtual positron annihilate we should see two photons emitted to opposite directions, right? If so, shouldn't we detect photons appearing from vacuum for every such pair?  Also, when a pair of virtual particles pops near event horizon of a black hole one particle may be captured by the black hole, while the other escapes it. Both particles have mass and energy. Thus caught particle brings the black hole its mass. Then how the black hole loses mass through Hawking radiation? Shouldn't it gain mass instead? "
825,Is it possible to observe if there is traces of life on an exoplanet?,"We can observe exoplanets, but is it possible with today's technology to observe if there is life as we know it on an exoplanet? What do you look for when doing this kind of observation?  "
826,"In my mid-forties, I believe I have seen Pluto for the first time with the naked eye","Early this morning going out on the balcony, I looked up on a star chart app to verify it was Jupiter I was seeing.  Then I noticed the alignment of Mars, Saturn, and Pluto on the app.    Never being able to identify it before, I stared at where Pluto should be and I'm pretty sure I saw it.  My only question is - since it's said that planets shine and stars twinkle, it did seem that Pluto was flicking a bit.  Is this normal?  Something to do with the relatively low luminosity and greater length of space? "
827,What happens to a star after it has become a red giant?,"When our sun reaches the end of its lifetime , it will turn into a red giant. How long will it be a red giant, and what happens after a star has been a red giant? Does it turn into a planet after a long enough time spent, when it has used up all its helium? "
828,Why can I see the dark side of the moon?,"Last weekend (29/30 April) the sky in my area (Central Europe) was pretty clear and the Moon was nicely visible. Funnily, one could not only see the sunlit area of the Moon, but also the dark side* could be easily recognised throughout the whole evening from blue hour until dark night. I attached two photos of the Moon that should illustrate the effect. The pictures (sorry for the poor quality) needed to get a little overexposed to capture the illuminated dark side, but with plain eye the effect could be well seen. We were speculating about the reasons why the non-sunlit area of the Moon could be seen.   diffraction of sunlight through the atmosphere can be neglected as the Moon doesn't have an atmosphere.  reflection of light that in turn was reflected from earth (Sun -> Earth -> Moon -> observer) sounded a little unlikely to me a psychological effect that kind of mentally completes the shape of the Moon, because we know it should be circular, sounded ok to me. But could be debunked as the dark side stays visible if one covers the bright side on the photo?    So I guess the  sunlight has to reach the dark side of the Moon somehow differently.  What could be provide enough light to make the dark side visible?  * not the far side of the Moon, but the non-sunlit area of the Moon    "
829,Does the Earth orbiting around the Earth-Moon barycenter cause a measurable centrifugal force?,"I just realized the Earth is not a stationary object with the moon orbiting around it.  As shown in this minimalist animation from Wikipedia, the Earth actually orbits a common barycenter with the moon.  If this was a carnival ride, people sitting in the moon and on the far side of the earth would certainly feel the centrifugal force acting on them.    However, this is a very large system in reality, and the Earth also has quite a strong gravitational force felt on the surface anyway.  So when it comes to accurately measuring gravity or doing experiments that rely on gravity, how big of a factor is this centrifugal force?  Does the apearant force of gravity fluctuate from 9.9 m/s^2 to 9.7 or is it more along the lines of 9.800001 to 9.799999 (assuming the average is exactly 9.8, which is a simplification).  Or is there something I'm missing that means the force is non-existent? "
830,Is there a upper limit to the number of planets orbiting a star?,"Our sun has 8 planets orbiting as well as a number of dwarf planets. Are there any calculations that hint as to whether this number is close to some theoretical maximum value or are we simply an average solar system in this particular way?   I could imagine that if you have many planets, they will likely interact with each other. Can you calculate any theoretical value for the maximum number of planets which have long-term stable orbits around their own star?  "
831,ECEF to ECI conversion,"How to perform the conversion of (r,v) vector from ECEF to ECI (J2000) coordinate frame?  What I tried  I multiplied the matrix ([cosA -sinA 0] [sinA cosA 0] [0 0 1]) by the state vector, where A is Greenwitch mean sidereal time.  This equation shows that the Z axis doesn't change. However, I have the ephemeris of a real satellite in both coordinate frames, and there Z axis differs!  Where is the issue? "
832,Do we know the exact spot where big bang took place?,"If you rewind the universe back 14,7 billion years, all matter were in one spot, and then started expanding. Do we know where this is in reference to our own solar system? And is there anything there? Or are all matter in the universe just blown inn all different directions and none is left at the ""original"" spot where it originated "
833,2002 Planetary alignement,"In april 2002 the inner planets had aligned and this event was captured in this beautiful photo:    But, according to this website simulations for the date, Jupiter was pretty much away. Is that possible? Can Jupiter saw as a straight line even be so far from the other planets?   "
834,Gravity on a right rectangular prism?,"Let's assume there is a right rectangular prism floating about in space, what would the gravity be like across its 6 flat surfaces? What gravity would you experience if you set foot on the rectangular prism's surface? Would it be the same as on Earth? Or would it be different the further along the surface you walk?   Let's assume that this right rectangular prism has a constant density and has a mass equal to Earth's. At any point on the surface of this prism, would gravity vary? That is, would it be an extreme variation than compared to one traveling across the surface of Earth? How extreme would this differential be?  Here's a rectangular prism with specific dimensions in mind.    "
835,"Is it ""weird"" that all disc galaxies rotate once every billion years?","In a recent paper (Cosmic clocks: A Tight Radius - Velocity Relationship for HI-Selected Galaxies by Meurer, et al.), it was noted in the conclusion that:     [This] implies a constant orbital time of ∼1 Gyr at [the outermost] radius [of disc galaxies].   Given what we knew about disc galaxies and dark matter up to this point, is this an unexpected conclusion? My sense is that it is strange that all disc galaxies have a constant rotation regardless of their size, but my intuition may be wrong. I know that dark matter speeds up the rotation of the outer parts of disc galaxies, but isn't it strange that they converge on this value? "
836,Is the full moon full everywhere on the planet?,"When the moon is full, fully lit by the sun, will it appear full everywhere on the planet?  E.g. if I where to set the date for the next three full moons for say: Sweden, Bali and Seattle how different would those dates be? "
837,How the watches are showing perfect time?,"The actual time for one day is 23hrs, 56mins, 4.1secs right? Then how can the clocks and watches can show perfect time?  I mean, if I observe the sun rise at 6:00am this day, tomorrow I should observe it before 6:00 or I can say at 5:56 approximately as our measuring devices follow 12+12 i.e., 24hr day. But in practice again it will be 6:00am when the sun rises. How it is possible? "
838,Most important feature of a telescope,"I was taking an astronomy test, the following question came up:     The most important function of the astronomical telescope is:         Resolving power   Light gathering power   magnifying power   focal length      The focal length obviously means nothing here, as well as the magnification (that can always be done later). As far as resolving power and light gathering power go though, they both seem to be ""equally"" important, in that without the first, there is no detail, and without the second, there is no image.  It does seem that exposure time can compensate for a lack of light gathering power (what matters is the product between the two), but nothing can compensate for resolving power.  My professor seems to think the answer is resolving power. Why is this? Is this some well known idea in astronomy? "
839,Is it possible to calculate the focal length of a refactor I built?,"I am trying to build a very low cost refractor telescope. It's for a project, so I need to be able to provide ""data"" about the telescope. But it seems I can't calculate anything (magnification, to be more specific) without knowing the focal length of my telescope. However, because I built it myself, I do not know what my focal length is. How can I find that out, or how can I calculate the magnification?  On another note, what is the best combination for the best magnification? I am not looking for anything great, just the best magnification possible.  I can have a 50mm lens with a fl of 50cm, 30cm, and 20cm and a 38mm lens with each of the same focal lengths. Which is the best pair? "
840,Unknown moving objects,"Last night, I used my new Sony WX500 camera to get long exposure pictures of the sky from my backyard.  I used the ""Heavens Above"" app to find out when satellite flares would happen and I even got a great picture of the ISS passing overhead at roughly -2mag.  I was able to identify many flares that I had gotten pictures of when reviewing the pictures today.  However, this is where it gets odd.    Some moving ""things"" didn't match what was supposed to show according to the app.  Some were accidentally caught in the pictures I took, and I'm sure there aren't any flares that the app showed me.    What could they be?  Shooting stars?  Forgotten or broken satellites? "
841,Total mass of light?,"I know that light is considered as energy, and as such has a mass.   So it is certainly taken into account in universes models and calculations.   So I'm wondering: How much of the total mass of the universe does light and electromagnetic waves accounts for? And how much does it contributes to its expansion?   Is it positive or negative? Since it is considered as mass only, it should decrease expansion somehow. Am I right about this? "
842,Can the supernova remnant SN 1572 be observed by amateur astronomers?,"The SN 1572 remnant, also called Tycho's supernova remnant, is beautiful in X-ray images. It seems to be rather dim in visible light. Are there any amateur photographs of this object? How long are the exposure times needed to get a nice picture? "
843,What's the fastest moving object in the universe?,"We know that nothing can have proper velocities larger than the speed of light in vacuum. But are there any objects in space that get close to it? Any comets, or other objects thrown by gravity or supernova explosions that were hurled to incredible speeds?  "
844,Does Ceres have an exosphere similar to the Moon?,"Thinking about the question and answers for Does the Moon have any oxygen in its atmosphere? begs the question, despite being considerably smaller than the Moon and further away from the sun, does Ceres have a similar atmosphere as the Moon? "
845,How was the time of equinox measured in ancient times?,"In the book ""The Crime of Claudius Ptolemy"" by Robert Newton, on page 81, it reads as follows:     When we measure the time of a solstice, we measure the time when the   meridian elevation angle of the sun has an extreme value, a maximum in   the summer, and a minimum in the winter.... When we measure the time   of an equinox, on the other hand, we measure the time when the   meridian elevation takes on a specified value.   What does he mean by a ""specified value"". What specified value?  Also, how would the ancients have determined the time of the maximum, or the specified value? Time devices in ancient Greece, like water clocks, I suppose would have significant errors. Would they just start the water clock when the sun rose, then marked its level when the ""specified value"" occurred? That method would seem to have a lot of error. "
846,What are the periods of Saturn's rings?,"I don't mean necessarily a granular chart of all of the different rings at different distances, but is it days? Weeks? "
847,Could the Moon naturally capture a large asteroid and keep it as a subsatellite? For how long?,"(Edited at James K's recommendation to stay on-topic for this SE.)  From my reading on this SE and from Googling I've gotten conflicting reports on the viability of subsatellites this close to the Sun, but a naive application of the Hill Sphere equation suggests that if it got captured at all, a large asteroid could theoretically orbit the moon in a stable orbit.  What I don't know is this:   For how long? Longer than a couple hundred thousand years, such that humans on Earth wouldn't have known anything else? Longer than a million years? Probably not longer than a billion, due to the tidal effects decaying the asteroid's orbit, but is that a bad assumption? How eccentric would the asteroid's orbit be? Would it be unlikely for it to orbit with negligible eccentricity, whether on the ecliptic or not? If so, what kind of eccentricity/orbital inclination would be reasonable?  "
848,Could we verify the structure of a black hole by observing an orbiting object?,"Can we determine the physical structure of a black hole by observing its gravitational effect on objects in orbit?  There are three possibilities that I see, and would like to test:   Singularity at the center - The traditional view that there is a singularity at the center (e.g. all mass is concentrated in the center). A structure where the black hole is filled throughout with matter inside the event horizon - My proposal, due to gravitational time dilation slowing / stopping time (e.g. a singularity will not form until an infinite amount of time has passed).  If the answer to my question on this subject here is correct, we should observe either possibility 2 or 3:  Does matter accumulate just outside the event horizon of a black hole? A hollow shell, with matter only on / near the outside edge of the event horizon - My proposal, combined with the ""vapor bubble"" behavior, as hinted at in some of the answers to the linked question.   Would these three possibilities differ gravitationally in ways that could be observed (e.g. by observing orbiting stars), or would they be identical from the outside?  If they would produce different results, I would love to see what result it is that we actually observe!  We have observed stars orbiting the super massive black hole at the center of the galaxy.

849,How exactly is the Initial Mass Function (IMF) calculated?,"The Initial Mass Function (IMF) is the empirical function which describes the initial masses of a population of stars. My questions are,  1) What are the various IMF's which are used?  2) For each, what type of population do they describe? (e.g. - galaxy, dwarf galaxy, globular cluster, etc..)  3) And how are they actually calculated? (meaning, do they come from simulations/observations, and what assumptions are made about each?)   Entire answers and pieces of answers are all welcome. Formulae (in latex, please) are encouraged. "

852,Can BY Draconis variable stars sustain any form of complex life?,"I wanted to ask this, because while I was working on two fictional planets back on the Worldbuilding SE, one of them being habitable, which orbit the 61 Cygni A star of the 61 Cygni binary star system, I realised something: 61 Cygni A is a BY Draconis variable star.   Here is the Wikipedia article link for more information.   My problem is: can a BY Draconis variable K-class star like 61 Cygni A permit the development of complex life, unlike its partner, 61 Cygni B, is a flare star that can barely get life past the primordial stage, if any planets are there? Or does it have some problems in that regard? If so, what are those problems that a habitable world in that star system could have, and other star systems of the BY Draconis variable star category?

853,How fast will the sun grow when it becomes a red giant?,We all know that our sun will become a red giant in a couple of billion years? But how fast will the process be when it starts? Would it be theoretically possible (disregarding the deadly effects of this event) for a human to experience the sun as its present size until it swallows earth? 
854,Can we tell how fast bodies are moving away by measuring their frequency?,"It's clear the universe is expanding because light from distant bodies, like galaxies, are shifted towards the red side of the spectrum.  In other words, the light measured is more red than it should be when compared to laboratory results.  This is great for measuring the distance to other bodies, but can't we also measure their velocities of departure by measuring how fast the light from these bodies is becoming more and more red over time?  That is, v is directly proportional to the change of frequency divided by the time elapsed? "
855,Is the shape of observable universe and shape of space same?,I have read that Euclidean space is considered as flat space and Minkowski space is flat space-time. So when we say our observable universe is flat are we saying that the space is flat or space-time is flat? I know the Planck data has proved the space to be flat but is it only space or space-time? Since in general relativity matter curves space-time and not just space. 
856,What might the surface of Jupiter's rocky core look like?,"Jupiter is posited, in some models, to have a rocky core about the size of a few Earths.  If we could see through the thick gaseous atmosphere, what topographical features might we find on the rocky core?  I know that no probe has ever sent data from Jupiter's (hypothesized) solid surface, and that orbiters probably can't penetrate the clouds to produce a topographic map, but do we at least have any educated guesses as to what sort of surface features are and are not likely to exist?  For example, given Jupiter's massive gravity, would the surface be extremely smooth?  Or would it not be out of the question to observe things like impact craters or mountain ranges? "

How is it possible? Why an arch and not a thick straight line? 
859,When is Earth closest to the Sun?,"When is Earth closest to the Sun?  Well, you say, perihelion of course.  But perihelion is when the Earth-Moon barycentre is closest to the Sun. Not Earth itself.  The barycentre is on average 4,671 km from the Earth, which should mean that even if the orbit of the Earth-Moon barycentre around the Sun were perfectly circular, the Earth-Moon orbit around the barycentre would cause an oscillation in the Earth-Sun distance by twice that amount on a monthly basis.  That should be enough to move Earth's closest approach to the Sun away from perihelion.  Considering this, how many days from perihelion may Earth's closest approach to the Sun be?  Question inspired by: What place on Earth is closest to the Sun? "
860,Time Dilation and Particle Decay,"I am teaching myself astronomy and I'm working on a basic problem regarding time dilation around black holes.  The question is basically this: if a neutron were ejected from a nucleus at a distance of 3km from a 1 solar mass black hole, how long would it appear to take for the neutron to decay (the assumption here is that the neutron would decay in 15 minutes... right on the half-life) to an outside observer?  My first thought was that we'd never see it decay, because 3km is the Schwarzschild radius of a BH of that mass, so the frequency would basically be [tex] and we'd never observe the decay event.  The text notes the time dilation   $$ \frac{\Delta t'}{\Delta t_\text{obs}} = \frac{\nu_f}{\nu_i}$$ where [tex] is the the time difference between two events at the source and [tex] at the observer.  We can use the relativistic red shift equation to get the wavelength difference (9.2 in my case using 1 solar mass and a radius of 3km) so that wouldn't be infinite, just big. For a 15 min [tex] then, the [tex] would be 15 min * 9.2, yeah?  So my two answers obviously contradict each other. What am I missing in my approach here? "
861,Why does Uranus and Neptune have more methane than Jupiter and Saturn?,"So the standard theory of the solar nebula is that in the region of the gas planets, ice and rock could condense to form planetesimals, which could then accrete Hydrogen and Helium to form the gas giants. The giant planets are all mostly hydrogen and helium, but Uranus and Neptune have relatively large amounts of hydrogen compounds like methane (that's what gives them their color).  My question is why did that happen? How did Uranus and Neptune get their methane? My impression is that all the gas giants were far enough out for methane to condense into ice, so how did Uranus and Neptune end up preferentially with methane? "
862,Information speed and our view of the cosmos,"It is common knowledge that when we look at the stars we look back in time. And most stars are thousands of lightyears away from each other. The information that photons cary about the position of a stellar object can be really deceiving about their true position.  Do astronomers take lightspeed into account when they map stars ? If so, how do they figure out the true position of a star.  With all that in mind do galaxies really look like what we see in our photographs? If a galaxy has a diameter of bilions of lightyears, what we see could be a really skewed and warped image of the real galaxy. Can we computationaly reverse the warping ?  EDIT Image 1 and 2 explain what I mean by ""Warping"". Stars closer to the core move faster and in combination with their distance from the viewer, information by light should give the impresion of a more ""spiraly"" galaxy as it whould take less time to reach the observer. Image 2 whould be the ""true"" shape of the galaxy if the effect could be reversed (I applied a counter clock-wise warp distortion)  An other factor of false position are gravitational lences. Although gravity from black holes do give the maximum distorsion, gravity from other stars could divert light reaching us. The diversion is negligent but can get big for astronomical distances (Image 3). Am I right ? If I am, do Astronomers even bother to make simulations to map the known sky as it whould be in real time ?   "
863,Which class of objects in Solar System carries more mass?,"Could you help me sorting this list in terms of total mass carried by these classes of objects?   The star (Sun) - it's very big but only one. The planets (incl. dwarf planets). Certainly beaten by the Sun, but... the asteroids, meteorites, comets, all that rubble. They aren't heavy individually but there's a lot of them. the interplanetary medium. It's very low density, but it overshadows the rest by far in terms of volume occupied.   I'm not sure where to attach the moons - some of them are larger than some dwarf planets, some are definitely more asteroid-sized. I guess - whoever decides to answer this, is free to pick where they'd like to include the moons (or maybe to split them between the two classes, say, attaching the ones with hydrostatic equilibrium to dwarf planets, and bundling the rest with the rubble)?

866,How to estimate uncertainty of measurements of equivalent widths?,"I'm measuring equivalent widths of absorption lines using a spectrum of a star. I make two or three measurements of each line by making reasonable gaussian fits of the line with IRAF's splot tool. Then I calculate the mean of the measurements, which serves as my final equivalent width estimate.   What is a good way of estimating the uncertainty of this measurement?  My current method  I'm currently using half of the range for the uncertainty. For example, if I made two measurements 10 and 16 mA (milliangstrom), then the mean is 13 mA and uncertainty is 3 mA. This gives the estimate of equivalent width to be 13±3 mA. Do you see any problems with this method of estimating uncertainty? "
867,Roche limit - calculation with centrifugal forces,"Let's assume there is a small natural satellite oribiting a massive planet. The satellite rotates synchronously (revolution period = orbital period) on a circular orbit, both bodies are homogenous and rigid. The question is, how to find the Roche limit with regard to centrifugal forces?  With use of Wikipedia I understand that the Roche limit is basically the orbit where difference of gravitational forces between the planet and two points in the satellite body (its centre and a surface facing to the planet) cancels the gravitational pull of the surface of the satellite to its centre. Wikipedia also states that more accurate is to include also the centrifugal force on the surface of the satellite due to its rotation.  Why is not included the difference of the centrifugal forces acting on satellite centre and surface facing to the planet, caused by satellite's orbital movement?  Are there any other forces I need to take into account, for example orbit of the whole sytem around a star? "
868,"If Venus had moon before and it fell back to Venus, why don't I see a unique, very big crater?","Does lack of a very big crater support the idea that Venus never had big moons before?   If not, why can't I find a very big crater from the moon impact? "

But what I get is like an image on the screen, which can be zoomed, and I'm not sure what I'm looking at.  What further process should I follow to make some analysis of Jovian radio signals at 20.1 MHz beyond just looking at the image (spectrogram? waterfall plot?) that the software produces?  Here is an example of the Radio Skypipe II output from their link:   "
870,"3 years later, how strong is the evidence for planet 9?","I came across post in quora where somebody said that ""most astronomers no longer think Planet 9 exists"" and being somewhat shocked by that, I did a google search and found a fairly recent article that claims exactly that.  It can take several years to prove a negative within pretty good certainty, as opposed to a discovery which can be checked pretty quickly.   Because I don't want to wait several years, I wanted to ask if the general consensus is that Planet 9 probably doesn't exist?  Or is there still a respectable amount of belief among astronomers in the original evidence and any new evidence that's followed?  If it ends up not existing, I'll be sorry to hear it.   It was a fun story when it lasted.   "
871,Is the flat earth cosmology scientifically justifiable today?,"With binoculars or telescopes you'd be able to see to other countries if the earth were flat. And looking out at the ocean we can see where the earth curves and things like the top of ships, not the whole ship. Unless those who think the earth is flat believe they are looking at the end of the world when looking out at the ocean? How do they arrive at this position? "
872,How Does IceCube Trace a Neutrino to its Source?,"I read the following claim in an article (Lisa Grossman, ""Origin of Cosmic Oddities Proposed,"" Science News, February 17, 2018, 8).     ... IceCube has already traced an especially high-energy neutrino to a single active black hole ... IceCube [Neutrino Observatory in Antarctica] could eventually trace neutrinos back to [active black holes in] galaxy clusters.   Aren't galaxy clusters at least millions of light-years from Earth?   Such neutrinos took millions of years to get to Earth. Other sources could have been in the path of the neutrinos in such a distant past. Are neutrinos affected by gravitational lenses as light can be? Is such tracing possible because neutrinos react so weakly with matter?  "
873,Would drinking melted ice water from Mars taste like sparkling water?,"Does water on Mars form from the atmosphere as ice free from salt? Does water desalinize through the evaporation and transpiration?  When the fresh top ice is placed in a container then pressurized to melt, would the water be carbonated?  Particulates of salt and dust is less in the atmosphere during a Martian winter so would the ice that forms be also drinkably cleaner?  [website][website][website]"
874,Any information on the salt content of Mars' atmospheric dust?,"Answers to and comments on How to drink water on Mars? suggest that one would not want to drink melted water ice obtained from exposed surface deposits near the poles because it may contain various salts and other dangerous chemicals (perchlorate salts are one particularly nasty suspected component of mars soil and it's water content).  Mars' atmosphere contains dust even when there are no dust storms, and in this answer it is explained to be the cause of the reddish color of the Martian sky as has been photographed by several Mars landers and rovers.  Are there any measurements or even models or predictions on how much of the particulate matter in Mars' atmosphere could be tiny particles of salt, or salt mixed with other minerals? Put more simply, how salty might Mars' atmosphere be?   Martian sunset (credit: NASA/JPL-Caltech/Texas A&amp;M/Cornell) borrowed from this answer. "
875,Galactic extinction as a function of distance,"I am looking at several galactic sources in the [tex], [tex] and [tex] bands and I want to calculate their absolute magnitudes. I can get the apparent magnitude and I know the distance so I just need to account for extinction to acquire the absolute magnitude. I first used the NED Coordinate Transformation &amp; Galactic Extinction Calculator but the calculated extinction values are too high. I figured that this is probably due to the fact that my sources are relatively close ([tex]) and I am thus only looking through a fraction of the dust that these coefficients were calculated for.  If I lower the extinction coefficients to a certain fraction of NED's value (say 60% in a particular case) then I get the expected answer but I'm looking for an accurate way to choose this fraction. I've looked for a method to calculate the extinction coefficients as a function of distance but haven't been able to find anything. Does there exist a map of extinction as a function of distance (and galactic coordinates) in the galaxy from which I can extrapolate the information required? Is there a way to calculate the extinction coefficients ([tex], [tex] and [tex]) for an object in the galaxy a known distance away? I found IPHAS which seems to be the right idea but I'm not sure if I can use it to get what I want (or how). "
876,Is it possible for stars not to rotate?,I'm just curious about that the existence of non-rotating stars. Is it physically possible for a star not to rotate at all? Does magnetic braking eventually stop the stellar rotation? 
877,Why are distant objects observed in the near infrared?,"I was reading an article that explains why JWST is a successor to Hubble and not a replacement for Hubble. They explained that Hubble's science pushed astronomers to look at longer wavelength. And then they said:         In particular, more distant objects are more highly redshifted, and their light is pushed from the UV and optical into the near-infrared.   So basically to observe the first galaxies, astronomers have to observe in infrared. My question is why distant objects require observations in the infrared?   Is it because they are at a very large distance from us, so the light has lost a lot of energy on its way so it's detectable in the infrared?  "
878,How to trim CCD overscan and amplifier turn on/off regions,"I have begun reducing images I collected with a telescope and CCD detector. I read in the the ""Handbook of CCD Astronomy"" by Howell that I need to trim overscan regions (as well as possible amplifier turn on/off) regions before I can compute the gain of the detector. However, it is not thoroughly clear where this boundary is.   If we treat the CCD detector as a matrix of pixels, then I know that the overscan region is along the edge columns. To visualize this, I computed the average and standard deviation along each column of pixels to view the variation in intensity from column to column. Below I inserted the left side of two amplifier matrices on my CCD detector:     The blue is the column-wise average and the green is the column-wise standard deviation. The y-axis is the (arbitrarily scaled) intensity and the x-axis is the pixel distance from the edge of the CCD array.   My question is essentially: how much of the blue and green curve should I cut-off?  Edit: additionally, it should be noted that I am using the method outlined in ""CCD Data..."" by Massey &amp; Jacoby (1992) link to compute the gain.  "
879,Is the earth bombarded equally in all directions by neutrinos?,"Perhaps it is hard to known for sure because neutrinos are very difficult to detect, although they do go through the earth in very large numbers. But are they passing through the earth equally from all directions or is it really depending on particular events in the universe. It's probable that the sun generates a lot of them, so perhaps in the daytime we receive more of them than at night. But besides the sun's radiation, are the neutrinos coming from everywhere? Or is it possible that the majority of them comes from one direction, and perhaps even has an influence on the earth's movement? "
880,Leaving the Milky Way,"If we had a hypothetical spacecraft, would it be possible to exit our galaxy, wait for some time and enter back into another section? Will this method be more efficient that a more traditional flight path?  "
881,How can I calculate how the debris of an object ripped apart at the Roche limit will spread out?,"Let's say I have a moon orbiting a planet at a distance [tex]. Eventually, [tex], where [tex] is the Roche limit of the moon-planet system. I can figure out the mass of both bodies by experiment, as well as their radii, and thus their density (which is how I can calculate the Roche limit).  I'm curious as to how the debris will spread out, though, once the moon is ripped apart. Can I calculate the inner and outer radii of the newly formed ring, based on what I know? Or is there not a direct relationship between these radii and the initial conditions? "
882,Is there any practical use for astronomy?,"Although astronomy is very cool and the things we are learning are awesome, is there really any practical use to knowing the things we know about the universe?    Do other fields of science draw from the current tome of astronomical knowledge? "
883,"If I point a camera at a ""+x"" visual magnitude object, how to estimate how many e- (carriers) are produced per second?","In this answer I estimated that if a DSLR (digital SLR) camera with an aperture of 40 mm were pointed at a satellite in geostationary orbit with a visual brightness of about +11 magnitude, it would produce roughly 200 e- per second in the camera's silicon sensor.  I did a similar estimate here.  The estimate is only slightly better than order-of-magnitude. I assumed that the spectrum was reflected solar, and the average photon had about 2.5 eV of energy.   Is this about right? Is there any better way to do this starting with a given number meant to be ""visual magnitude""?    I understand there are plenty of different definitions of magnitude that involve the specification of a specific band, (e.g. UBV) but when you are handed simply a visual magnitude, how can one estimate number of photons electrons in silicon?  Yes, a precise calculation is quite sophisticated, but here I'm asking only for a good way to estimate. Let's call a silicon CCD's QE 0.8 and flat for example.  "
884,How is it possible that the CMB approaches the earth from all directions?,"I presume that the photons from the CMB approach the earth from all directions, otherwise we couldn't detect them with a picture where it is present everywhere in the universe with a tiny anisotropy.  Now the CMB is a result of the big bang. Another result of the big bang is that in all directions we see galaxies moving away from us, like we are in the center of the universe (which is probably not the case).  But why are all the galaxies (except a few) moving away from us while the CMB is approching us. What is the reason for that difference? Or aren't those photons coming from everywhere? "
885,Could Hot Jupiter systems sustain Trojans?,"My understanding is that there is a gravitationally stable region between the Sun and Mercury where asteroids could - in theory - orbit for long periods without being perturbed. However these hypothetical vulcanoids are seemingly non-existent; it being likely that their orbits decay through other means besides the influence of a planet, such as the Yarkovsky effect. We also have trojan asteroids, which share the orbits of planets such as Jupiter but spend their time in the leading and trailing Lagrange Points, keeping their orbits stable.  If a Hot Jupiter such as 51 Pegasi b were to host trojan asteroids, would their proximity to the planet allow their orbits to remain stable for longer, or would their orbits decay regardless? If a Hot Jupiter migrated inwards towards its star, is it more likely to have swept away any possible trojans? "
886,If Mercury and Venus where to collide would it make a habitable planet?,"I have been wondering for a while now about a scenario of where if you combined Venus &amp; Mercury would it be habitable if located in the goldy locks zone? I have found in my little research that Venus doesn't have an internally generated magnetic field. But Mercury does indeed have an internally generated magnetic field. Though weaker than Earths of course.   I don't really know what other factors for making it to whether or not this new plant would be able to sustain life.   So my question is, would the new planet be habitable, or are there more factors needed to determine this? "
887,Surface Conditions,"Planets like Saturn &amp; Jupiter are called ""gas giants""--does that mean that there is no surface to walk upon? Though some source of gravity is required to hold the gas in place, isn't it? Venus: we are told that it rains sulphuric acid, there. Given the reported surface-temp. of 450C., wouldn't these ""acid drops"" vaporise long before they reached the ground--producing vapour-clouds, in the upper atmosphere? If a person could stand on the surface of Venus, what would he see--would it be just like our moon? "
888,"Infrared telescopes, magnitude and observations","Currently 22-23 magnitude could be the limit to make a spectrum for ground based 10m class telescopes, 21-22 magnitude may be easy for them. 4m class telescopes could possibly handle 20 magnitude, I am not sure. 2m could be appropriate for stars brighter than 16magnitude generally.  What about the infrared bands: J H K W1 W2 respectively? Are there any empirical values or references?   "
889,"If a white dwarf collides with a giant star, could it create a TZO?","Thorne–Żytkow objects (TZOs) form from collisions between neutron stars and main sequence or giant stars. Ultimately, the neutron star becomes the ""core"" of the giant star.  However, could this also happen with white dwarfs, if the combined mass is below the TOV limit? White dwarfs are degenerate stars, just like neutron stars, so would they be able to replace the star core in the same way? Would anything happen to the white dwarf if the combined mass is beyond the Chandrasekhar limit? "
890,Could a moon orbit an Earth size planet in such a way as to create a solar eclipse lasting for several weeks from start to finish?,"Is it theoretically possible for a  moon to orbit a planet (let us say Earth size, mass and solar distance) in such a way as to create a planet-wide solar eclipse lasting several weeks?  These are my assumptions (some of them likely flawed) about the circumstances under which this might be possible:   To simplify the problem, let us assume that there is no planetary axial tilt and that the moon has an equatorial orbit. The orbital speed of the moon would need to be quite slow in order to stay in position for long enough to create a graduating eclipse over several weeks. In order to create a planet wide eclipse, the moon would need to be quite large and/or relatively close to the planet. Is this circumstance feasible if the mass of the object were low compared to its size? How stable could the described relationship be?   Thank you for your interest and answers. "
891,VLT interferometry vs E-ELT?,"If the VLT (very large telescope) can use interferomerty to act as a 200 meter mirror, then why are they trying to build the 39 meter E-ELT? What advantage does the E-ELT have, if the VLT can act as a 200 meter mirror? "
892,Can ground based telescopes use a starshade in space?,"1) Could a starshade in orbit be used by ground based telescopes? If so, what kind of orbit should it have?  2) Could the same starshade be used by two different space telescopes, or does the positioning make it impractical? "
893,Can we observe what objects exist at the L3 positiion of planets of our solar system?,"From what I understand Earth's L3 is obscured by the Sun, so is that true for our viewpoint of the other planets? Or, are there times when other planets are on the other side of the Sun from Earth and we can see their L3 position? For the Hilda's of Jupiter have we observed them in that position or is it that we have calculated their coordinates to be in the L3 position? "
894,What is the difference between the way light travels in a gravitational field and the way it travels through an expanding universe?,"A photon is travelling through space. As it travels, the space through which it travels is expanding  Does this describe   A - a photon travelling from a distant galaxy to earth B - a photon travelling from a point of higher to a point of lower gravity C - either   If like me you think the answer is C, can you explain why light should travel differently through a gravitational field to how it travels through an expanding universe? In other words, why in one case does the speed of the photon vary, while in the other case it doesn't?   Alternatively can you explain why you don't think it's C?  I have asked a similar question on the Physics Stack, but I probably worded it badly, so I just got a load of down votes and no answers. I hope I haven't offended anyone here with this wording. "
895,What should I consider in order to accurately calculate the moon phase?,"Although this question apparently addresses the topic, it does not tell appropriate factors involving the moon phase.    I found two distinct algorithms. this one and also this one. I am less than a newbie, less than a layman, to astronomy - but I am not to programming, but I would like to skip testing the algorithm for a couple of years before choosing either.  After unsuccessfully finding a comparison of different algorithms, I'd like to know of either of these algorithms is less error-prone, or if there is someone less error prone-to these (I know there is no stuff like a perfect algorithm, but I'd like to have a good one), or having appropriate ways to judge an algorithm.  So my question comes like this:  Do these methods have a small error, enough to accurately calculate the moon phase?  Or...  Can you give me the most precise algorithm -or concepts / underlying theory I should know- astronomers would use as of today to calculate the moon phase? "
896,Life planets orbiting black-holes. Can/Do they really exist?,"So, I watched Interstellar and if you watched it too you know that there's a planet orbiting a black-hole, they call it Miller's Planet. According to the movie, every hour on Miller's Planet is equivalent to 7 years on Earth due to gravitational pull from the black-hole.  Question: Assuming there are other life forms in the universe, is it really possible for it to be near a black-hole? Is it possible that they came to existence thousands (or even millions) of years before us, but are not as advanced as us because time on our planet is way quicker than that of theirs? is a lot more for us? If they have an assignment due tomorrow, we have, say, 100 years more time to do it (assume what else we can do in that 100 years). Or they actually are more advanced than us, but from Earth, they somehow live in the past? "
897,Does the mass of the observable universe ever change?,"First do we have anyway to even estimate the mass of the entire observable universe?  And then is there any data that shows mass being gained or lost?  Would we ever know if someone was playing with the til.    Also I want to be clear that I am not talking about small masses on the outskirts of the ""universe"" or small discrepancies in measurement or anything of the sort.    Note:  I would like to add that maybe we should define the observable universe as NOW (x-date) so that we aren't calculating a moving target.   "
898,What causes Titan a moon to have a denser atmosphere than that of a Mars?,"I'm wondering about Mars and Titan. If Mars is larger than Titan how come it lost most of its atmosphere? Mars also has a magnetic field while Titan doesn't. Yet Titans atmospheric pressure on the surface is a whopping 1.5 times that of Earth's.   Question: What causes Mars not to have much of an atmosphere, but Titan does? "
899,What happens when star spins too fast?,"Some stars such as a neutron star can spin very fast around 600 times a second, wouldn't the star be ripped apart? Although the gravitational pull is very strong but gravity is the weakest of all known forces and any good theory why neutron stars spin that fast does it have anything to do with the magnetic field and the surrounding dust clouds? "
900,Moon inclination,"The Moon is inclined to the ecliptic 5.15 degrees, and the equator of the Earth tilts 23.44 degrees. Since the Moon's ascending node to the ecliptic rotates, the Moon's inclination to the Earth's equator varies between 18.3 ( = 23.44 - 5.15) to 28.6 ( = 23.44 + 5.15) degrees.  My question is:     ""Does only our moon have this property, or are there some other moons of other planets with a similar property?""   From Wikipedia it seems many moons of other planets have a fixed inclination to the equator of their planet, so our Moon seems a special case. But is our moon's inclination property the only case? "

902,How high does light pollution reach into the sky?,I want to know how high does light pollution typically reach into the sky STRAIGHT UP? Has anyone ever researched this because I wonder if being at 10000ft elevation would reduce the amount of light pollution from nearby cities because of the height assuming that light pollution weakens the higher you go. How high would it go STRAIGHT UP THE SKY (NOT to the sides about how far i would have to travel to have no light pollution disturbing the night sky)?

905,"How many amateur telescopes are looking for serendipity in a coordinated fashion, on average?","I can't read the Nature Astronomy article A kilometre-sized Kuiper belt object discovered by stellar occultation using amateur telescopes because the library I use doesn't subscribe electronically.  However I can see the bibliography and the word serendipitous appears the titles of two different references, and that makes me think that the observation described in the paper was in fact serendipitous.   Question: On average, roughly, how many amateur telescopes are looking for serendipity in a coordinated fashion? A few? A dozen? How many ""professional"" telescopes or those funded for science are involved in this campaign as well?  One example of an organized campaign looking for serendipity is in Japan, which is described in The Universe Today's Tiny Object Found at the Edge of the Solar System for the First Time.

906,How do we know the universe's expansion is speeding up?,"Please forgive my ignorance, I am not an astronomer, just an interested layman.  The further away a galaxy is from us, the faster it is moving away from us.  But the galaxies we see exist in the distant past because it takes a long time for their light to reach us. The closer galaxies are, the more recent their light is, and the slower they move away from us. Doesn’t this seem to indicate that the expansion of the universe is slowing down, because the more recent light from galaxies, appears to be moving away slower? Does this make sense?  Quote from Wikipedia:     Hubble observed that the distances to faraway galaxies were strongly correlated with their redshifts. This was interpreted to mean that all distant galaxies and clusters are receding away from our vantage point with an apparent velocity proportional to their distance: that is, the farther they are, the faster they move away from us, regardless of direction.

909,Change in axis of the Earth if the Moon would dissappear,"I read that, if the moon would not be there or if it would dissapear or be destroyed it could cause the earth to rotate into a possible axis of 45° degrees. Because it would be missing the gravitational forces of the moon that keeps te earth in the current axis of +-23.5°. If that happend a part of the earth, for example Europe, could turn in a way that it would be permanently ""night"".   If I understood that correctly and it is possible, would that transformation take long? Or would it be fast? And with fast I am talking about a couple of years or decades and long about thousands or millions of years.  I am working on a story that would involve this and I am trying to see if I can get the logic to work with a real scientific explanation.   Thanks in advance for any help :) "
910,Mercury mapping attempts before Mariner 10?,"Mercury's surface was not mapped up-close until Mariner 10 passed by in 1974. This was followed by MESSENGER in 2008. I have seen several attempts of mapping Mars that came before space exploration, such as Schiaparelli's maps from 1877.  With regards to Mercury, were there any documented attempts to map its surface with ground-based observations prior to unmanned space exploration? If so, however unlikely, did any observed features from Earth match up with Mariner or MESSENGER close-ups? "
911,How accurately can you tell the time using a photo of the stars?,"If I were to go out on a clear night, in an area with low light pollution, and take a photo of the stars, could an expert analyze the photo and figure out what date the photo is from? We can assume a powerful camera, but not reaching up to the strength of a telescope.  This question stems from a larger project. It would be very convenient for me if it were possible to take a photo of the stars to tell the time. Even more convenient if you could narrow it down to within 10 minutes, but if that's not possible I'm wondering how close we can get. Can you tell the year? The millennium? Do you need to know which location on Earth the photo was taken from? Does it help if you already know the year in which the photo was taken?  You can assume access to modern computing, existing databases, state-of-the-art software, etc. (no supercomputers)  Thanks! "

The situation is as follows:      Say, you are observing with a telescope with an effective area of 44000 [tex]. Assume that the total efficiency through the atmosphere, the telescope, optics and the filter is 50%. How long would it take to collect 80 photons from a source with V=20?   I have little to no idea how to tackle this problem. Can someone help? I've had lectures about spectral flux density, and I'd assume you'll have to use it here.  Thanks in advance!  Adam. "
915,Collision of asteroid and gaseous planet - what would happen,"What happens when asteroids (or other small bodies) ""collide"" with a gas planet? In my head it would either go through it or just stay ""inside"" it due to the strong gravity.

916,"Does astronomical observing ""count"" as remote sensing?","I have long considered astronomical observing as a form of remote sensing, though quite different than typical remote sensing in that many objects observed are not resolved.

And/or are there any resources that can be pointed to that either do or don't call astronomical observing remote sensing? "
917,Is it certain that dark matter consists of particles? (And not just curved space),The main idea about dark matter today seems to be supersymmetry. That there exists a set of yet undiscovered fundamental particles which (in a mathematically most convenient way) mirror the particles already known.  But has it been established that dark matter consists of particles at all? Couldn't it for example be a continuous property of space itself in some regions? That some parts of space are curved without the influence of any particles or waves. Is anything but particles ruled out? 
918,What happened to the third planet in the Kepler-47 system?,"In 2012, the discovery paper for the multiplanet circumbinary system Kepler-47 mentioned a potential third transiting planet in the system:     A 0.2% deep transit-like event is present at time 2,455,977.363 (BJD) that is not caused by   either of the two planets. A search for additional transits has revealed several more tentative   transit events (12), but we caution that the star is faint (the Kepler magnitude is 15.178), there   are large modulations due to star-spots, and the data contain correlated “red” noise, making   small, non-periodic transit detection challenging. The marginal evidence at the present time is   insufficient to place confidence on any additional candidate planet(s).   In 2013, Jerome Orosz gave a talk at the Second Kepler Science conference titled ""The Confirmation of a Third Planet in the Kepler-47 Circumbinary System"", claiming the detection of two further transits attributed to the third planet and giving the orbital period as 187.3 days and noting that the dynamical fit indicates that transits would stop for four years starting in July 2013.  In 2015, the discovery paper for Kepler-453 b was published, describing this planet as the tenth circumbinary planet discovered by the Kepler mission, which lists Kepler-47 d as the ninth of the previously discovered planets, giving a reference of ""Orosz 2015, in preparation"".  As far as I have been able to tell, there has been no further update since then - the Orosz 2015 paper never appeared. Is anyone aware of any further updates about this system and whether or not the third planet is still considered to be present? "

920,How to calculate position of an unknown star knowing positions of some other stars from an image?,"  Suppose I know the coordinates (right ascension and declination) of the stars marked with red. How should I calculate the coordinates of an unknown star, marked with yellow?  Searching over the web, I found a technique called least squares plate constants. I guess plate constants dates back before CCD cameras. Unfortunately there was only little explanation. However, if I understood the matter correctly, I should assume the stars are on a surface of a sphere imaged to a plane? Please help :)  Also, how should I calculate the distances between the stars?  The original image is from Wikipedia. "
921,Why are there no green stars?,"There are red stars, and orange stars, and yellow stars, and blue stars, and they are all understandable save the fact that there is a 'gap': There are no green stars.

If so, I need some pictures; they must look awesome. "
922,Why is the difference from a perfect sphere the same for the Earth and the Moon?,"Wikipedia gives the following physical dimensions for the Moon:     Physical characteristics  Mean radius        1737.1 km  (0.273 of Earth's) Equatorial radius  1738.1 km  (0.273 of Earth's) Polar radius       1736.0 km  (0.273 of Earth's)    In all cases, the proportion of Earth's equivalent measurement is 0.273. If these figures are accurate, why aren't these numbers (0.273) different from each other at this scale? Obviously, if measured to enough decimal places, differences will appear.  The Moon has less gravity and rotates at a different speed from the Earth. Why don't these cause variability in the different radius measurements? Do they cancel out? It is a coincidence? Is there something about the Earth-Moon dynamics that means over millions of years these proportions gradually equalise? "

931,Are there any ready-made machine-learning datasets of photometric data that are easy to use?,"Disclaimer: I have a Machine Learning/Computer Vision background, not Astrophysics, so please be a bit patient with me. If you feel like this question is too far out there it would be great if you could direct me to meta or some bulletin board/mailing list that you think is a better fit. :)  Important: I am talking about ""datasets"" in a machine learning / computer vision manner. I do not mean ""the entirety of SDSS data"" but rather a common set of inputs and (for supervised learning) associated outputs for a specific problem.  I have been looking for a while now to tinker with some problems in Astronomy/Astrophysics and I keep finding the same kind of advice when it comes to datasets:  Go to SDSS/GalaxyZoo, they provide downloads for their data.  Now, while that is true, none of these datasets are anywhere near as accessible as datasets in Computer Vision. ""Over here"" a dataset is mostly a bunch of (huge) tar files with jpeg images and some .mat or .csv for annotations. The process of getting started is pretty straigth-forward: unzip, load annotations into memory, start sciencing (or usually, applying wild heuristics). Obviously I simplify slightly, but you get the idea.  Now, to stay with the example of GalaxyZoo, the object coordinates, annotations and computed features are conveniently presented as a csv, fits or voTable file. But to get the actual visual data (if I understand this correctly) I have to, for each annotated galaxy...   determine a bunch of .fits urls from the coordinates in the annotations (one per band and galaxy) and download them (~12MB/file) download the containing ""tiles"" from the SDSS servers (in each of the bands I'd like to work with) extract the patch containing the galaxies (with the aptly named sExtractor) possibly apply some non-trivial corrections/transforms to the image patch   I tried following along this procedure with a semi-randomly chosen paper from arXiv for which there is code available here and without wanting to make any statement about said paper/code, this process is not comparable to the simple workflow I described above, and I would probably download some TB of data, were I to use the entire dataset, of which only a tiny fraction would actually be useful.  The resulting dataset only occupies a few GB of space, and has a very simple nature: ca 50000 images, with associated labels -1 or 1, for stars or galaxies. The data preparation pipeline, while one might also want to optimize it for this task, has next to nothing to do with the ""real"" work being done in the paper, and so having the reader go through those steps makes little sense to me.  So my questions are:   Did I understand the workflow correctly? Maybe I'm just following the wrong kind of paper, or I really just overlooked a big red ""Download Here!"" button? Otherwise: Did anyone go through these steps and make the resulting dataset available? Or are there good reasons not to do so? From the size of the sExtractor manual I gather that the choice of parameters in this processing step might significantly influence the outcome of any downstream method. So... Are there any sane/agreed-upon default settings for the preprocessing pipeline? While for any given method, applying extra ""magic"" in the preprocessing might make sense, having a default set of parameters would make dataset creation and a bunch of other things much easier, no?   I am sorry if this is a naive newcomer question. And for the long post. :P As a meta, I would add tags ""dataset"" and ""programming"" or some such, but I lack the reputation. "
932,How did Johannes Hevelius' long telescope work? Why all the round holes?,"The drawing below, found in Wikimedia and at lib.harvard.edu is of a very long tubed aerial telescope. I believe it is taken from his 1673 work Machinae coelestis.  I've always wondered about the purposes of all those (20+) square blocks with round holes, spaced evenly from one end to the other.  I've included two cropped views from Harvard University, Houghton Library, pga_typ_620_73_451_fig_aa (found here) the first of which I've zoomed and enhanced the contrast both to better appreciate the cute bird, and to try to read the annotations; there seems to be a 772 or 722 next to one of the blocks near the top left.  Question: What was the function of all of these blocks? Is it optical, or mechanical, both, neither? When I was young I thought there were lenses in each one, but I'm assuming now that at least the central circular holes are completely open.  I think it is pretty easy to guess either one, but presumably with such detailed annotation there is text to go along with this image somewhere and it is likely that we can know Hevelius's intention. I just don't know where to read the text.   I believe that the text is here but it's 1,000 pages long and in a language that I can't understand.     "
933,Can you assume atmosphere height for the purpose of surface pressure calculation?,"Given that by definition of scale height an atmosphere thins by a factor of 1/e^x where x is elevation in terms of scale height multiples (See the table here: Definition of Scale Height), can we assume that the atmosphere is effectively non-existent at the elevation of 6H?  Density at elevation 6H 1/e^6 = ~0.00248 would mean about 0.2% of density at surface level  I know there is no real physical boundary but what I'm looking for is what is the assumed standard for simplifying calculations. Or is it just a bad idea to try and do it this way?  *This is a followup to another question: How can you determine the initial volume of a planet's atmosphere? "

Furthermore, can one do this also considering the moons of the planets?  Thank you! "
935,Do falling bodies ever slow down?,"I've had some discussions recently about black holes, and the issue of infalling bodies taking forever to reach the event horizon. That's essentially what Einstein said in his 1939 paper on a stationary system with spherical symmetry consisting of many gravitating masses. He said ""it is easy to show that both light rays and material particles take an infinitely long time (measured in “coordinate time”) in order to reach the point r = μ/2 when originating from a point r > μ/2”.  Now, I'm a big fan of Einstein. But there seems to be two issues with this:   One is that Einstein concluded that black holes cannot form, but we have good evidence that there are black holes out there. The obvious example is Sagittarius A*. That's where's there’s something with a mass 4.28 million times the Sun, with a diameter of less than 44 million kilometres, and we can't see it. Surely it's just got to be a black hole.    The other issue is that falling bodies don't slow down. Imagine you drop a body at elevation A and it falls down to elevation B. The ""force"" of gravity relates to the first derivative of gravitational potential. Hence the bigger the difference in gravitational time dilation between elevations A and B, the faster the body falls past B. Then if you drop a body at elevation B it falls down to elevation C. Again the bigger the difference in gravitational time dilation between elevations B and C, the faster the body falls past C. In a typical gravitational field the force of gravity at B is greater than at A. Hence as the body descends, the acceleration increases as well as the falling speed.   Imagine a gedanken spaceship from which we've suspended a cable. We have clocks at different elevations, so we can measure the gravitational time dilation at each elevation. We can also release test bodies at each elevation and record the  clock readings as they fall past other elevations:      At the end of the experiment we can reel in the cable and upload the recorded measurements to ascertain how our test bodies behaved. My understanding is that we will always find that time dilation always increases as we descend, that the falling body always accelerate downwards, and that both the acceleration and the falling speed always increases as the body descends. Is this correct? Or do falling bodies somehow stop accelerating? And do falling bodies ever slow down?    "
936,Will biological process be disrupted under strong gravitational time dilation?,"This question is raised by someone I've discussed with, after watching the movie ""Interstellar"", in which a clip showing Cooper and Amelia landing on Miller's planet near a super-massive blackhole and they experienced quite amount of time dilation due to the gravitational effect. They spent like 20 minutes there and when they backed to the station they found out that 23 years have passed on station (where Romilly waited them for 23 years to return).  It's okay for this conception to be implemented here I believe most people will understand. We will just think that yeah 23 years has passed but they just feel normal, just like a 20-minutes park walking. BUT, no one has ever experienced such a strong time dilation, how could you be sure Cooper ""just feel normal""?  I remember reading a book which says if you are rushing directly to center of a blackhole, when you are very very close to the Schwartzchild radius, you may experience a whole lifespan of universe IN A SECOND, in other words, you are rushing to the real end of the world. I really doubt any life could 'feel' that second passing. Anyway, this is an extreme example.  So the question: will biological process behaves normal under certain gravitational condition? If it does, can we feel differently? Does our conscious get used to the normal time flow all life on earth are living with? more crudely, will we die due to the extreme time dilation caused by gravity (provided that gravity affect homogeneously upon us) and if so, how?  An interesting extra: If Romilly could observe Cooper from station and sees a near still 'slow-motion' picture of him, will Cooper conversely see a 'fast-motion Romilly' from the ground of Miller's planet?

937,"What is the ""lost light"" in this unusual Hubble Deep Sky image?","The Daily Galaxy article “The Lost Hubble” –New! Deepest Image of the Universe Ever Taken says:     To produce the image a group of researchers from the Instituto de Astrofísica de Canarias (IAC) led by Alejandro S. Borlaff used original HUDF images from the Hubble Space Telescope. After improving the process of combining several images the group was able to recover a large quantity of light from the outer zones of the largest galaxies in the HUDF. Recovering this light, emitted by the stars in these outer zones, was equivalent to recovering the light from a complete galaxy (“smeared out” over the whole field) and for some galaxies this missing light shows that they have diameters almost twice as big as previously measured.   The image looks really strange, what is going on? Is there a technical article associated with this work?   "
938,How to obtain distance modulus and Total extinction from Isochrone fitting to CMD?,"This is my first post here.   I am studying the following article: [website]On Page 5, Sec 3.1, the authors are presenting their results they obtained via Isochrone fitting to the CMD of the two GCs being discussed. My questions are:   How can I find out the distance modulus and the Total extinction [tex] from just the fitting? I know that Isochrone fitting is done when we need to estimate the age. In order to fit, we need to move the Isochrone both vertically (Distance modulus?) and horizontally (Color excess/Reddening/Extinction?). Is my understanding correct? How do they convert the Reddening in filters to reddening in B-V? What is the technical details/physics of it? What is the role of the Extinction law in getting these numbers? In the end, they calculate the distance, which is simple once we get the distance modulus. Why is it the distance from the Sun? Did we assume a heliocentric coordinate system somewhere?   Thank You.

940,Habitable Planet around Red Dwarf,"Is there the possibility for a habitable Planet around a red dwarf? It is not required that the whole surface is habitable, but it shouldn't be a tiny spot.  After reading a bit I assume the planet would be tidally locked to the star, with the side that faces the sun looking like an archery-target (from center to border: scorching, hot, warm, cold, freezing).  Also from space it would look like a Rugby Ball (exaggerated) pointed at the star.   But would such a planet be stable enough to develop and support life more complex than the simplest forms?     I do not need a specific star, but the general answer if this is possible, however unlikely (though a value how unlikely would be nice). "

For example, A0 denotes the hottest stars in the A class and A9 denotes the coolest ones. Fractional numbers are allowed; for example, the star Mu Normae is classified as O9.7. The Sun is classified as G2.   So our Sun is a G2V yellow dwarf.  The G identifies its temperature as within the range of 5,200-6,000K. The V tells us it is on its main sequence.  That leaves us with the 2. The 2 tells us that the sun is warmer than a G3 star and cooler than a G1. I get that. My problem: I just can't seem to figure out how the ranges of these specific numerical subclasses are determined. Are they explicitly defined? Logarithmic? Is there a way to calculate it exactly? Why is Mu Normae a O9.7?  My best guess is to take the range of the stellar class and divide it into 10 subsections but I can't find any source to confirm that. "
942,Correction to inverse square law for cosmology,"While reading about the discovery of quasars and the spectroscopic analysis of 3C 273 in this paper by Maarten Schmidt, I came across the following quote:     At these distances, corrections to luminosities depend on the specific world model. For   an approximate determination of the fluxes in the emission lines we use the formulae   given by Sandage (1961) based on Mattig (1958). For the energy contained within an   emission line, in which we integrate over the entire profile, the correction to the inverse square law is of the form [tex]   if the cosmological constant and deceleration parameter are zero. It is [tex]   for the steady-state model.   First, why is a correction to the inverse square law necessary? Is it to do with interstellar extinction?  Second, why are the two models different? I understand what the cosmological constant and deceleration parameter are, but why is the redshift prediction for a steady state model twice as much as when [tex]? "
943,Where to obtain Tycho Brahe's data?,I would like to obtain Tycho Brahe's data on Mars. What would be an authoritative source? One source I could find is this page (the data is given as an Excel file) but I have no idea can that be trusted. Does some astronomical organization or university keep the data public? I suppose Tycho wrote his data into a book. Where is that book located at the moment? 
944,Under what situations can an aperture mask improve the resolution of a small/medium amateur telescope? Is this demonstrable mathematically?,"@antlersoft's answer describes some of the challenges to seeing any details in the small disk of Mars in small amateur telescopes. In the case of reflecting telescopes, it mentions the use of either an off-axis parabolic mirror, or an off-axis aperture mask on a standard Newtonian to produce a clear unobstructed view.   The answer links to a short article on the amateur telescope site BBAstroDesigns which is titled Off-Axis Masks: Light Reduction and Resolution  If I understand the explanation correctly, besides the light reduction function, the off-axis masking excludes the secondary mirror and support, thereby removing diffracted light.  I'm a bit surprised that for amateur viewing on Earth that diffraction from a Newtonian or Cassegrain's secondary mirror and supports would really have any impact on resolution of small extended objects like Mars. The example in the article is a 16 inch telescope. I would have thought that seeing would be the limitation, but maybe for bright objects a smaller diameter (1/3 to 1/6 of the full aperture) is actually better?   Is it possible to explain the physics/optic behind the use of off-axis apertures to improve resolution as discussed in these links?  If possible, can a bit of math be used to demonstrate this quantitatively and convincingly? "
945,How to find Greenwich Mean Sideral Time?,"I'm writing a program that converts position in the ECI (CIS, EPOCH JD2000.0) coordinate system to WGS 84 (CTS, ECEF) coordinates. To do so, I'm following what's described in this document and implementing C++ code.  My knowledge of astrophysics is very limited, so I find it hard to understand some terms. Especially, I can't seem to understand properly how the Greenwich Mean Sideral Time is computed, and why I always get different values.   For instance (assuming time is 2019-01-01 08:00:00 and Julian Date is 2458484.833333):   If I use this on-line GMST calculator, I find that GMST is 14:42:45.3766. If I use the expression used in this MATLAB script (showing the value in time, not degrees) I also get 14:42:45.350. However, if I calculate it myself with the expression given in the above appendix, I get 06:42:45.379163 (with a clear offset of    According to the equations in page A-26, GMST depends upon the number of Julian centuries (Tu). H0 expression is exactly the same than that of CelesTrak for θ(0h). However, I can't really understand what the du truly stands for, or more specifically, why the document shows du → ±0.5, 1.5, 2.5.... Moreover, to find Λ (which is stated to be in seconds of time) the expressions use values in radians and seconds of time indistinctly.  Could somebody shed light into this? "
946,Did I see another planet?,"A couple days ago, I zoomed in with my 30x optical zoom camera, and after some exposure adjustments, a bright star in the night sky turned into this:    Are those other planets or other stars?

EDIT: Question answered, more clear picture added FYI.   "
947,Calculating RA/dec from JPL ephemeris data,"I'm using JPL planetary ephemerides to calculate the position of planets. Using DE405 ephemeris (using a parser provided by Project Pluto with all tests passing). I am fetching the position of Mars with the observer set as the Earth (geocentric).  My first assumption is that the result is a set of geocentric equatorial coordinates in rectangular form (x, y, z). This may be incorrect.  My goal is to calculate RA/Dec. My second assumption is that I should use a formula converting from Cartesian to Spherical:  [tex] [tex] [tex]  Using Julian day 2457134 (21st Apr 2015, noon UTC), and cross-checking the result with NASA's Horizons service which apparently uses the same ephemeris (DE405) gets me almost there but my results are a little off:  x 1.721427968227801 y 1.5802812301744067 z 0.6897426775298559  RA 02h50m12.51s Dec +16°26'41.37""  Horizons:  RA 02h50m11.52s Dec +16°26'36.5""  I'm not sure what I'm missing.

If so, which are the possible effects it could have over Earth and Mars? In which cases would they be expelled from the solar system? "
950,Was there ever a hypothesis about a planet called Biga?,"I just re-read a popular astronomy book that was published when I was a child, about 1973. It starts with an interview to Harold C. Urey where the interviewer asks about a hypothetical planet in our solar system called Biga.  Has a hypothetical planet ever been called ""Biga"" by its  proponents, in the same way there was a proposed planet ""Vulcan"", or is this ""Biga"" name a printing or translation error?  If it's a mistake and there never was a ""Biga"" proposal, which is the proposed planet with the most similar name?  This link contains such interview, in Spanish. I will translate and quote its most relevant text:     Interviewer: At present, do we know all the planets of the Solar   System, or is there the possibility of still unknown planets in our   system?      H.C. Urey: We certainly know the nine usual planets. Recently there   has been much talk of another object moving in space and supposed to   be close to the Solar System, but I am not sure that it is a real   hypothesis, and personally I think it is better to wait before   deciding whether it is Not of a planet. I consider it sufficient to   say that there are Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn,   Uranus, Neptune, Pluto and the asteroidal belt.      Interviewer: When talking about this object, are you referring to the   so-called planet Biga?      H.C. Urey: Yes, that's what I meant, but I'm not sure of its   existence.   Please, remember:  1- This interview mas made about 45 yeras ago.   2- I'm not asking if this hypothesis is correct or even possible. Only want to know more about this hypothesis which was well known by H. C. Urey in the 70's.  3- I'm not asking if the name ""Biga"" is a correct proposal of a name for a planet in our Solar System accordind to current naming rules. "

Assuming (for simplicity) that this gear has the same density as the human body (the air supply would probably much heavier), could you float on top of denser gas layers below you?  I believe the density of the gas would only have to be about as high as the density of water on the surface of the sea. And would that mean that when you pour out a bottle of water, the water would float in the air (given the temperature/pressure ratio is below the boiling point)? "

958,Transform asteroid rotation to heliocentric ecliptic coordinates,"I'm working with data from the DAMIT database of asteroid shape models.  I'm adding them to a visualization in which the sun is at [0, 0, 0] and the X, Y axes constitute the ecliptic plane of the solar system.  Each asteroid model comes with some attributes that define its orientation and spin:   λ (ecliptic longitude),  β (ecliptic latitude) P (sidereal rotation period) φ0 (initial rotation angle) JD0 (initial date).   I've applied the matrix formulas suggested by the folks at DAMIT:    in which    This is where I get confused.  My understanding is that my visualization uses a heliocentric ecliptic coordinate system.  I set r_ast to the XYZ location of a vertex in my visualization.  I'm not sure this is correct.  Then I compute r_ecl from the equation above.  But I think variables λ and β are angles in a geocentric ecliptic coordinate system and I need to do some transformation into heliocentric ecliptic coordinates.  Is my approach correct and if so, how can I convert the asteroid's rotation to my visualization's heliocentric ecliptic coordinate system? "
959,Is the North star going to stay in the North sky?,"Considering how the our solar system, and how every other star in the galaxy is traveling through the cosmos, it seems like it's a miracle that the stars and constellations in the sky stay as constant as they are.      How is it that the North Star seems to be fixed in space? Is it following our star through space? are we following it? Is it actually moving? Are we getting further away from it? Closer to it? What is our relationship to Polaris in the Galaxy? "
960,Primordial angular momentum?,"Angular momentum, and in particular the conservation of angular momentum, is of course very relevant in many processes in astrophysics, such as e.g. star- and planet formation, and disk formation in galaxies.   The concept of objects spinning up upon collapse is straightforward enough to understand, but this begs the question: where does the primordial angular momentum come from?   Tidal interactions between haloes, I suppose?  "
961,What would this moving point of light be?,"Tonight (10:00 PM EST Middlesex County, Mass.) when looking at a mostly clear sky I observed what I at first believed was a meteor. This point of light was moving east to northeast, and that would be in the vicinity of the Lyrid meteor shower.   In the app Star Walk for iOS it says that the ""n-Lyrids"" meteor shower peaks on May 9th. However, information I found online about this meteor shower says it already peaked back in April. (I did see a bright meteor a couple weeks ago.)   Can anyone offer insight on possible meteors right now? I highly doubt that this was a meteor though, because it lasted way too long, probably two minutes.   My next guess was the International Space Station but NASA's Spot The Station did not show any viewing times for my area today. The Star Walk app also showed the ISS well below the horizon.   This leads me to conclude the object was a plane, however there were no blinking lights and the only time its light changed was when it passed behind a thin cloud.   It could also have been a satellite glint such as an Iridium flare. I did not see the beginning of the light's appearance, so it is possible I missed the flare. However flares do not last for minutes, but glint from solar panels or other satellites may last this long.   What did I see? "
962,What decided how the Kepler space telescope was pointed?,"I suppose that the Kepler field was well chosen. It is rich in stars and has minimal background light since it is pointing out from the disc.  But other things could have been considered. For example, a field which contains the most stars which are near enough to be followed up by ground based telescopes. And why wasn't Kepler designed to change its pointing so it could cover several fields, such as all of the above? Funny enough, it does so now as K2 after two of its reaction wheels have broken, so studying only one field doesn't seem to be a technical issue, but something which astronomers prefer. Why? "
963,Is night sky getting brighter day by day?,"Night sky is dark because light from distant stars has yet not reached our earth. Light emitted by stars formed after the instant of creation i.e. 13.7 billion light years ago is on the way to reach us. As light from these distant stars reach us, night sky must keep getting brighter. How true is this? And to what extent? Can one day night sky become as bright as a day? "
964,How Does Black Hole Evaporation Look From the Inside?,"Imagine you're inside a black hole event horizon. The curvature of spacetime is such that the direction towards the singularity becomes timelike, as reverse movement becomes literally impossible.  How would Hawking radiative evaporation look like from inside the black hole? From the outside perspective, we know that black holes form (from our time dimension perspective) and then evaporate at a rate that is an inverse function of their mass.  Hawking radiation is created when the vacuum state at the horizon looks as if it is transformed into a non-vacuum state for a distant observer, resulting in a negative energy 'input' to the black hole. If the energy loss this way is not compensated by inputs from outside, the black hole event horizon should gradually shrink, resulting in eventual evaporation. How if at all would that be perceptible by an observer inside the black hole horizon?  Similar question, but no accepted answer. "
965,Stars at near break-up rotation rates,"Accretion discs are ubiquitous in astrophisics. As a direct corollary, they are important for the following question.  Consider the following model, representing one of the most simple models for accretion discs. A central object is a star (pre-MS, WD or NS, but not a BH) of mass [tex], surrounded by a thin flat disc of material, which continuosly feeds the star at a rate [tex], such that [tex] is much larger than thermal and dynamical timescale of the star (i.e. accretion rate is slow).  Everywhere in the accretion disc its local motion is nearly circular and nearly Keplerian. Therefore, at the interface of the star and the disc the disc will always tend to make the star rotate at nearly-Keplerian velocities. From the other hand, if the stellar outer parts were to rotate at nearly-Keplerian velocities, these parts would become gravitationaly detached from the star, which would have significant consequences for the stellar shape and structure. Surely, though, the process is going to be slow and the acquired angular momentum will be redistributed within the star.  Now the question: What will be happening to the star if it approaches nearly break-up velocities due to such a spin-up? This involves a few subquestions: How close the rotation rate can actually get to the critical one? If it can get close enough, how would the whole process look like? That is, what would happen in the short term to the star when the effects of rotation will start to affect its structure? What would happen to the star in the long term?  I would like to keep this problem as a purely hydrodynamical one. That is, assume, that the only laws involved are hydrodynamical and gravitational ones, with some constant accretion rate supported. In reality magnetic fields would also play an important role for some stars, and stellar winds could also possibly be important.  Examples of the decribed systems are numerous. It might concern cataclysmic variables, millisecond pulsars, pre-main sequence star in a protoplanetary disc, and many more. "
966,How do we know if an object is redshifted?,"I have some questions about redshift. I think that the first two hang on the last two, but feel free to point out anything you think I should know.   How do we know if an object is actually redshifted, and that we aren't just seeing the regular spectrum of the star?  How can we tell the extent to which a star is redshifted?   Do astronomers have a full baseline spectrum that they compare the measured spectrum against? Or do they just use the hydrogen spectrum since all stars are mostly hydrogen?  "
967,Is there Dark Matter inside the Earth?,"Since Dark Matter is assumed to interact gravitationally, it follows that the gravitation of massive regular matter bodies should have an effect on it. Even if it is otherwise weakly interacting with regular matter, one might naively expect concentrations of it enter orbit around massive objects, like neutron stars, regular stars, and even (why not) our own planet.   So, a two-fold question: 1) Could there be Dark Matter in orbit around (or within) the Earth? 2) If that were possible, would there be any way for humans to tell if such is actually the case? "
968,How large are the effects of nongravitational forces on comet Halley?,"The effects of outgassing on comet orbits can be noticeable. Yeomans, in  Cometary orbit determination and nongravitational forces, 2004, wrote:     As the astrometric datasets improve and lengthen and as the modeling of the cometary nongravitational effects becomes more realistic, there remains the strong possibility that some physical characteristics of comets will soon be accurately determined from the orbit-determination process alone. We are already beginning to see signs that this is the case.   How much does the orbital period of comet Halley vary due to these nongravitational forces? Hours? Days?  Which comets have the largest perturbations due to these forces?  Note: a more sophisticated question along these lines is Did Rosetta improve on models of non-gravitational effects on comet 67P's orbit? - Space Exploration Stack Exchange "
969,"Colossus telescope, trying to outsmart aliens?","I was listening to Jeff Kuhn's talk on SETI's Colossus telescope project.  Background:  He explains his theory that a civilization living somewhere the galaxy would want to hide, and thus would shortly learn to avoid broadcasting radio signals all over the galaxy, so as to avoid attracting attention (presumably to avoid inter-stellar predators).  Then he comes up with a great idea; due to the second law of thermodynamics, they would have to dissipate heat-energy, and thus, one can detect them anyway, because they have no way to hide this heat-energy. This, particularly when they are a Type I civilization, and nearing Type II; in this case, to avoid global warming, they would capture and use almost all solar energy, and emit an equivalent amount heat-energy.  Thus he proposes a telescope to focus on single stars, which would be capable of detecting this heat-energy (by the distinctive infrared light emmited).  My question:  If a civilization was smart enough to hide all of its radio signals, wouldn't they know that they cannot avoid emitting heat-energy? Thus their predators would be able to find them anyway, and thus, it is pointless to hide the radio signals?  Therefore, we should already be seeing their radio signals, and this telescope is being built for a theory with some holes.  Note: I am not suggesting that the telescope shouldn't be built; I think it could have other very valuable uses, and it would also be interesting to eliminate the theory if it is indeed incorrect (or prove it correct ... somehow). I am just asking if there might be justifications for the theory, in light of my point-in-question, which I am missing. "
970,What is the radiant intensity of the celestial sphere?,"Specifically, excluding the Sun and the Moon: How much energy, as light and other frequencies reaches a point in space on the average, if you add up all the sources like distant stars, the Milky Way, distant galaxies, nebulae etc.? How much brighter is the space than ""perfect blackness"" on the average?  Say, we've developed a magical solar battery that has 100% efficiency, can absorb all electromagnetic frequencies, is spherical, fully omnidirectional and has [tex] of cross-section surface (56cm radius);  we sent it out halfway to Proxima Centauri and we measure how much power it produces - how many watts we'd get out of the battery utilizing all the starlight available?  Note: If ""all frequencies"" is not easily obtainable, the luminous counterpart to radiant values will be okay (only taking visible spectrum into account).  "
971,How well can we in principle determine $T_{\textrm{eff}}$ of a star?,"This is a question about the basics of astronomy, which I have never happened to see a good discussion for. It is about how well would we be able to measure effective temperature of a star, if we had any arbitrarily perfect measurement devices.  Here is some context. Canonical definition of [tex] of a star is based on its bolometric luminosity [tex] (total electromagnetic energy radiated by the star per unit time) and its photospheric radius R (radius, at which the optical depth at a given wavelength is equal to unity). This way, the definition specifies  [tex] through [tex], where [tex] is Stefan-Boltzmann constant.   The definition clearly alludes to black-body law. Many stars, including our own Sun, have a spectrum that does not follow it. For this reason, one often talks about another effective temperature, which is the temperature of stellar material at photospheric radius, and which can be determined by examining stellar spectrum. There are a few more complications to that, but let's put them aside.  Determining  [tex] is extremely important in characterising stars, therefore there exists a variety of methods of measuring it, and naturally researchers strive for obtaining the best possible precision.  Hence, the question: How well can one in principle measure [tex], if one could have arbitrarily perfect instruments?   Edit: I would like to see a quantitative estimate in your answer. Is the best possible precision for [tex] of order [tex], or is it [tex], or some [tex], or can we measure it arbitrarily well?  Here are just a few sources of uncertainty/arbitrariness: convection in stars, dependence of photospheric radius on wavelength, limb darkening, stellar variability, to name a few.  I would encourage the answers to be in the format ""Source of uncertainty"" - ""Simple derivation"" - ""Estimate of the effect"". If there are more than a few estimates, I will add a summary of them in the question or in a separate reply. Please, also feel free to edit the question if you might like to. "
972,Time according to the gravity of Sagittarius A?,"This may be a really dumb question (I'm more of a Biologist than an Astronomer) so I apologize in advance for my little knowledge pertaining to Astronomy, but, if I'm not mistaken, time is effected by gravity, right? So what is Sagittarius A's time compared to ours since it has so much stronger gravity? Do we know specifically the difference? "
973,What happens to the Gas Pressure when working out the Eddington Luminosity?,I am looking at how the Eddington Luminosity is derived and I do no understand why we only care about [tex]?

975,On analogies between gas and stellar systems,"Analogies between (typically) ideal gas and stellar systems are not only intuitively valid to some extent, but have been established and used in the studies of stellar clusters and galactic systems, most often as a simplification to collisionless Boltzmann equations.  The idea behind the analogy is that if a stellar system can be represented as a set of point masses, and if the number of point masses is large, then we can consider them from the point of view of kinetic theory of gases. One thing to remember here, though, is that stellar gas system is neither relaxed, nor can be relaxed.  I am curious here: How far can the described analogy be pushed?  For example, there is a range of gas-specific phenomena (or we could be talking about plasma, if you may prefer), which would be fascinating to imagine for stellar systems, such as shocks, turbulence or viscosity. Can such, or some other, characteristic phenomena exist in stellar systems and are there actual systems exhibiting such a behavior? (of the named ones, viscosity analogue exists and is rather common) "

978,"Mini black holes, a possible result of the LHC experiment at CERN","A scientist at CERN LHC (Large Hadron Collider) was asked during an interview about the possible results and consequences of operating the LHC at full power of collision in the near future, one of the results he literally said :     One of the theories that predicts the consequences of operating the LHC at full power collision is that mini black holes might form, but do not be afraid of those black holes, they will not start expanding and destroy the earth, they will instantaneously disappear.   I know that black holes create disturbance in space-time. And they actually appear when matter massively gets pressurized into a small size of volume in space which causes gravity to increase insanely which in turn initialize a black hole that even light its self can not escape away from.  So how can a mini black hole disappear anyway? What in the world would cause a small size, a mini size, a tiny little black hole to vanish or disappear? "
979,Do neutrinos have as much information as photons do?,"If neutrino detectors keep improving so that a fair number of neutrinos can be observed, would they be as informative for astronomy as photons are?  They are of course a very valuable complement to photons, but I'm thinking about neutrinos in and of themselves. Photons have wavelength, spectral lines, redshift, diffraction, polarization which reveal their origin and interactions on the way to us. Do neutrinos say more than just what direction they come from? "

981,Calculating the age of the universe,Is the calculated age of the universe that of the visible universe or the entire universe? I dont know how the age is calculated but if it is believed that all we see visibly IS the entire universe then that means it is finite.

I did the same with Jupiter : Jupiter / (Jupiter + Io + Europa + Ganymede + Callisto) and it's about 99.97% (I ignored small satellites).   Why is it such a high ratio in this 3 examples? Is 1% a regular number for satellites' mass? It is simple gravitation maths ?   I understand that one body has to be much more massive in order to be a planet-satellite system, otherwise it's a double planet system. But I would have thought 90% would be enough. "
987,Difference in redshift between 2 interacting galaxies,"I have a galaxy 'A', say at redshift 1. Let's suppose this galaxy has no peculiar velocity. What would be the redshift of another galaxy 'B', that has a radial velocity of 500 km/s, relative to A?  All this in the standard (Planck) model.  Any tools to do get this easily (an python code, astropy?) "
988,How can we be sure that we have identified very distant stars correctly?,"From reading this question on calculating distance to stars and from a bit of background reading on the standard candle theory I still don't see how we can confirm that a star we see at one distance and a star we see at another distance (redshifted and at a different apparent luminosity) are the same type.  Beyond a certain distance, parallax is not possible, so how can we confirm star X and star Y are the same type therefore the difference in redshift and luminosity means Y must be at distance Z. How do we know it isn't a different type of star at a different distance?  Or are we just saying they look similar, so probably are? "
989,I saw a light moving fast what could it be?,"Today, at about 23:40 in Sungkyungwan University, South Korea, a friend and I spotted a bright light.   It was brighter than nearby stars. Since I was looking at South, and at that time, the brightest star in the Southern sky was Saturn, with an apparent magnitude of about 0.9, I'm safely assuming that its apparent magnitude was brighter than 0.9. The thing was even brighter than that (I think that it was as bright as a full moon).  Its initial altitude was about 60degrees then it fell below the horizon very quickly (in about 3~4 seconds). At first, I thought that it was a comet of some kind, but It wasn`t leaving any traces in the sky, and also it was moving in sort of a random way, going from left to right to left to right and so on.   It was a point, but it was so bright that it appeared larger than Vega(I'm not talking about absolute sizes, as stars don't have sizes. I'm just saying that, just as brighter stars seem larger, this moving thing was brighter and therefore, seemed larger.)  My friend and I saw it together, and wondered what it was.   Then, after about 10 minutes, it appeared again. But this time, it came from the place where it disappeared at its first sight. It moved up to about 10degrees (altitude). When it was going up, it was going up in a parabolic path. Then, it came down but along the way, its path changed from parabola to zig zag. Going from up to down took about 2 seconds.   What could this be? This cannot have been an optical illusion because both my friend and I witnessed it. Also, it could not have been a satellite as it was too bright(almost as bright as the moon) and moved in a non-linear path (also it moved very very fast).   What could this be?  "
990,Determine the moons of Jupiter through a telescope,"I was doing my own ""space exploration"" last night with a telescope. Being a space noob I can't visually determine stars or planets (I know the moon, though), but I focused on one particularly bright one when I saw 4 smaller ""stars"" on each side. After a quick Google I learned I had discovered the moons of Jupiter!    I now know the moons I could see were Io, Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto. But which is which?  Is there an easy way to determine which Galilean moon is which? "
991,Can protoplanetary disks form main-sequence stars?,"As has been pointed out by @Envite in the context of a more general discussion (see Generalised planets?), there seems to be a moderate possibility for protoplanetary discs forming main-sequence stars (MS stars).  Main argument here is that Jupiter has mass of about [tex], while in principle for an object to be a MS star, it would need the mass of at least about [tex]. Also, there is a handful of systems, such as HD 29587, which contain a star and a brown dwarf, possibly forming from a protoplanetary disk.  Hence, a few questions. Can low-mass MS stars form in protoplanetary discs? If no, why? If yes, how often does it happen? If yes, which implications would it have for the subsequent dynamics of the planetary system, if one of the objects became a MS star, as opposed to it being a brown dwarf?  Again, thanks to @Envite for the idea. "
992,Can moon set after being up when due north? (pseudo circumpolarity),"I'm in the northern hemisphere, facing north, and notice that the moon  is due north (azimuth 0) and is still above the horizon, albeit barely.   Does this mean the moon is necessarily circumpolar (doesn't set), at  least for the next few hours?   As the moon moves away from due north, it's altitude/elevation  normally increases. However, it's possible that the moon's declination  is decreasing so rapidly that the moon's elevation actually decreases,  and the moon sets.   Is this possible?   This question is tangentially related to my question ""libnova odd behavior for 89.5 degrees north latitude"" on Stack Overflow.  EDIT to answer questions: I am facing true north. I am referring to the Earth's true moon, but not necessarily in any given time frame. In other words, if something like this happens 10,000 years from now, that's fine.  EDIT: OK, I believe the moon CAN set even if it's up when due north. Example:    You are at latitude 89.5N  The moon's declination when due north is +0.5N. This means the  moon grazes the horizon when due north.  If the moon's declination were constant, it's highest elevation  for the day would be 1 degree.  Since the moon's declination can change more than one degree per  day (average of 1.5 degrees/day), it's quite possible for the moon's  declination to go below -0.5N, at which point it would have set (it  will actually set before this point unless it happens to reach due  south).    In theory, this could happen with any object whose declination  changes, provide you're close enough to the North Pole.   I'll leave this update open for critiques.   EDIT: Actually, this whole question is just asking whether the midnight sun/moon can set at any position other than due north, which is fairly obviously true. Reasoning: once the moon/sun finally sets not due north, it was obviously still up the last time it was due north.  "
993,Does a White hole lies behind a Black hole?,"While reading about a White holes, I stumbled upon a question ""Where does the matter emitted by a White hole come from?"" There seems to be 2 possible candidates:     It was the matter engulfed by a Black hole.   Matter was created inside the White hole.     My search on wiki stated that:    According to Penrose Diagram of Schwarzschild radius, objects first leave the White hole and then may enter into a Black hole. But, due to Hawking radiation, a Black hole can achieve thermal equilibrium with gas of radiation. This equilibrium state is reversal invariant, implying that time reversal of a Black hole is again a Black hole. This means that a Black hole and a White hole are same objects.  My 2nd candidate suggests that the big-bang was a white hole. I thought of ruling this out because it requires the existence of a white hole before the big-bang.    This forced me to draw the conclusion that a white hole must either be inside a black hole or behind it.   Is this correct (provided that we haven't yet proven the existence of a White hole)? Where am I wrong? "

996,Effect of the obliquity of the ecliptic / tilt of the Earth on the equation of time,"In an attempting to answer the question “why aren’t changes in sunset and sunrise times symmetrical  around the solstices ?” I’ve got stuck on being able to explain the effect of the obliquity of the ecliptic.   I understand the general idea of the equation of time and how the difference in clock time and solar time answer my original question, but I’m struggling to grasp how the tilt of the Earth contributes to the equation of time.   I’m trying to visualise the effect, and assuming it is to do with the point at which the sun is highest in the sky not being in the middle of sunset and sunrise (except at solsitces and equinoxes?). So, is this correct? Is there any good way of trying to visualise it ?   I’m a bit confused by the wikipedia entry [website]“If this effect operated alone, then days would be up to 24 hours and 20.3 seconds long (measured solar noon to solar noon) near the solstices, and as much as 20.3 seconds shorter than 24 hours near the equinoxes”  “the inclination of the ecliptic results in the contribution of a sine wave variation with an amplitude of 9.87 minutes and a period of a half year to the equation of time. The zero points of this sine wave are reached at the equinoxes and solstices”. Is point 1 correct ?   Also found these links helpful to some extent, but haven’t fully explained it for me.

997,How do scientists determine the age of stars?,"I was Googling about the oldest galaxies in the Universe. Everywhere is written that their age is known by the light. Referring to this line ""Since light travels at a set speed, if you look at a star ten light years away, you're really seeing what it looked like ten years ago"" on this site.  So my question is, as we know light is continuous, how do scientists know that a particular ray has started its journey some 1000 light years back? How is the age of stars determined? "

Does anyone have a single complete graph that shows temperature of the Sun from the very middle, to somewhere far out in the corona? One that would show where the peaks appear relative to each other, what size are the regions of temperature to each other - not a tiny slice but a more general image? "
1000,Orbits using Newtons laws,"I am making a small orbit simulator. I figured out Kepler's laws and know how to work with them to ""update"" an orbit based on time. So now I want to know how I can describe orbits with newton laws. Given a position vector and a velocity vector of a satellite, What I currently do is this:   Calculate gravitational acceleration: (g*mass)/distance^2 Add this number to the velocity vector. Multiply the new velocity vector with the DeltaTime Add it to the position vector Go back to 1.   However when converting this to Keplerian Orbit Elements doesn't really make them constant.(Calculations from here: Cartesian To Kepler)  Also the orbit isn't really stable, and also wobbles around. So can anyone help me fix this? Or am I doing something wrong? "
1001,How does one determine the effective temperature of a star from its spectrum?,"Determining effective temperature of a star is in general a non-trivial task. Simple reason for this is that we can only study the electromagnetic radiation from a star, but not the temperature directly. The complexity is due to the fact that the radiation is produced in stratified stellar atmospheres, which are only partially characterised by stellar temperature, but also by many other factors, such as stellar mass, elemental abundances, stellar rotation, etc. What is more, the temperature of atmospheres varies with depth, whereas effective temperature is just a number.  From the other hand, temperatures and magnitudes are the most important quantities, characterising stars.  So, the question: How exactly does one use the spectrum to extract the information about the temperature of a star? By temperature here I mean effective temperature, or even the temperature profile of the atmosphere.  Note: This a rather textbook question. I created it because I have encountered a good existing answer by @Carl, previously posted in a bit less textbook discussion How well can we in principle determine [tex] of a star? . This question seems to be a much better place for the answer. "

1007,Where did Mars water go?,"Many sources indicate that there is ice water on Mars today, but it is mainly traces, here and there, but not that much.  However, solid hypothesis state that there were oceans on Mars, see Wikipedia's Mars ocean hypothesis or at least large aquifers on early Mars. They all concern early Mars so around 3.5 to 4 billions years ago. These theories suggest that Mars oceans could have formed Mesa landscapes (just likeGrand Canyon or Monument Valley).  So my question is simple, if all these hypotheses are true, where did that water go?  Is it possible that so much water could have been evacuated from the planet? I guess it would have needed A LOT of energy.  So it may have been transformed on the planet.  Is it possible that the water has oxidized iron, creating Iron oxide (ie rust) and that it is the main reason for Mars red color? The Mars ocean hypothesis page suggests some leads about the fate of that ocean, but none suggests the oxidation of iron consuming the entire oceans. Moreover, oxidation would imply the presence of water and dioxygen...   [website]"
1008,How significant are the recent results that Scholz’s Star has perturbed several observed hyperbolic objects?,"The Gizmodo article A Visiting Star Jostled Our Solar System 70,000 Years Ago refers to the the three year old ApJ. paper The Closest Known Flyby of a Star to the Solar System (also ArXiv) which describes Scholz’s Star and it's pass close to our solar system about 70,000 years ago.  The Gizmodo article then discusses the newly published paper in MNRAS Where the Solar system meets the solar neighbourhood: patterns in the distribution of radiants of observed hyperbolic minor bodies. However, while I can access the earlier paper, the new result is paywalled and I'm not able to access it (at least not soon).  The second half of the abstract in particular is confusing me.     Here, we perform a systematic numerical exploration of the past orbital evolution of known hyperbolic minor bodies using a full N-body approach and statistical analyses to study their radiants. Our results confirm the theoretical expectations that strong anisotropies are present in the data. We also identify a statistically significant overdensity of high-speed radiants towards the constellation of Gemini that could be due to the closest and most recent known fly-by of a star to the Solar system, that of the so-called Scholz's star. In addition to and besides 1I/2017 U1 (‘Oumuamua), we single out eight candidate interstellar comets based on their radiants’ velocities.   I've heard of a radiant of a meteor shower - it's an apparent position of the source of meteors referenced to the position of the Earth at the time of the shower. But I've= never heard the term applied to the orbit of a minor body unrelated to the Earth's position. What is the ""radiant"" of a minor body with a hyperbolic orbit in a simulation? Could it be the asymptotic incoming direction of the hyperbola?  But my main question is simply how ""statistically significant"" is this result in reference to the enhancement in the direction of Gemini? I can't see the data. Is it just a tiny fluctuation, or a fairly obvious and robust feature?  A screen shot of the data would be most welcomed!  Possibly helpful: List of hyperbolic comets. "
1009,Is there any known moon of a moon?,"As far as I understand, a moon is an object in permanent orbit around a planet, dwarf-planet, asteroid, etc. If there was another object permanently orbiting this moon, would that be a moon-moon?

1010,How can absolute value of azimuth exceed distance from pole?,"I'm sure I'm just doing something dumb, but:    Yildun has a declination of approximately 86.5. This puts it 3.5  degrees from the celestial north pole.  Per the snapshot below, Yildun's azimuth can be as high as 4.17  degrees.  Since the celestial north pole always has an azimuth of 0,  wouldn't this put Yildun 4.17 degrees from the pole, contradicting  the distance calculated from declination?    What am I missing?     EDIT: I thought I'd figured this out:   On Earth, one degree of latitude is not the same as one degree of longitude (except at the equator).  Analogously, in the sky, one declination degree is not the same as one right ascension degree.    I thought the situation for right ascension applied to azimuth, but it doesn't.  Both azimuth and declination are measured on ""great circles"" (declination is measured on a half circle, but same general idea), so degrees in azimuth should equal degrees in declination. "
1011,Wondering about a horseshoe orbit,"Since I'm not a physicist, I want to know how that system works.

1013,How do planets retain momentum?,"I'm watching this YouTube video, and in it, the lecturer explains a model of planetary orbit. At 1:55 he shows how a marble will naturally orbit the center object, and he briefly claims that planets will not lose energy like the marble does. But I cant see how that is the case. Surely there must be meteors, asteroids, comets, including general space debris, that will over the course of millennia, diminish this energy/momentum.  How then, can planets retain their energy, when there are almost only forces that would slow it down? Slowly increasing the energy wouldn't help either, as it would offset the balance. How can there be stability, especially over the course of millions of years? "
1014,Does the Earth ever cross the Moon's path with respect to the CMB?,"Title says it, really. As I understand, our total peculiar motion with respect to the CMB is 631 (+/-20) km/h, in the direction of 10.5h RA; -24 deg Dec (or rather away from 22.5h RA; +24 deg Dec, right? That's close to the direction of Lambda Pegasi).  So, if we draw a line from the Moon to Lambda Pegasi, does Earth ever cross it?  I think the answer is no, but don't have enough of a model to prove it to myself.  The inclination of the Moon's orbit is 5.14 degrees, and the Earth subtends about 1.2 degrees from the moon, but the Moon's path extends off at 24 degrees above the ecliptic. So the Earth won't cross it, right?  This is all assuming that the vector info above is the total, and already accounts for the motion of the sun around the milky way. If that's not the case, please let me know. "
1015,Is there any telescope on Earth that can see the lunar rovers on the moon?,"If I have the right numbers, it seems to me that even Hubble telescope might barely be able to make out a carcass of a blue whale on the surface of the moon, which puts objects as small as the lunar rovers or the American flag left there by Apollo out of range. Hubble is often lauded as the best telescope we have built. I know a large part of that is because it is in space where it's free from all of the interference of the atmosphere, but is there any ground-based observatory with better resolution? Is there any place on Earth where I could point a scope at the Sea of Tranquility and see what we left there over 40 years ago? "
1016,Motivation for using $\sigma_{8}$?,"Press-Schechter formalism allows one to universally quantify the number of massive dark matter halos in a given volume -- The Halo Mass Function. The density contrast is given by the rms mass variance in Fourier space, which is the dependent on the linear power spectrum [tex] in a smooth window [tex] \begin{align} \sigma^{2}(R,z)  = \frac{1}{2\pi^{2}}  \int_{0}^{\infty} dk\ k^{2} P_{\rm lin}(k,z) \left| \widetilde{W}(k;R)\right|^{2} \end{align}  The halo count can be scaled via observations in a defined window region of [tex]. We can solve for this analytical/numerically and measure it from CMB fluctuations, given by the parameter [tex]. The power spectrum, as well as the halo mass function, is then scaled through the normalization of the analytical variance and the observed variance.  My question is then, why do we choose a smoothing radius of [tex]? Is it arbitrarily chosen to compute the number variance in a cluster, or is their more too that? What prevents me from defining the window radius of [tex] (just ignore the fact that the  WMAP and PLANCK results give [tex] in the radius of [tex])? "
1017,"In a planetary system close to the galactic core, would it be possible to see the supermassive black hole?","I understand that radiation on planets near the galaxy’s center make life on these planets nearly impossible, and that one cannot truly “see” a black hole.

1019,Is sundial time entirely dependent on solar azimuth?,"I've visited several ""how sundials work"" sites and can't seem to get a  clear answer to this: is ""sundial time"" just a linear function of  solar azimuth? More specifically:    When the sun is due south (northern hemisphere), it is sundial  noon. All sites I've visited agree on this.  When the sun is due west (azimuth 270 degrees), I say the sundial  time is 6pm, a quarter turn/day from noon. However, I can't find a  site that actually says this, and some sites seem to disagree with  this. Same for it being 6am sundial time when the sun is due east.    I know there are different types of sundials, but had always assumed  they would give the same sundial time. Is that not true?   As a note, the sundial I describe above can be fairly inaccurate at  times, which makes me question whether I'm correct.  EDIT (to clarify question): Forgetting entirely about clock time for a  moment, suppose I build a sundial. When the sun is due west, my  sundial reads 6pm. When the sun is due east, my sundial reads  6am. When the sun is due south, my sundial reads noon. My question:  have I built my sundial correctly? The type of answer I'm hoping to  get:    No. When you build a sundial, it should read (something else) when  the sun is due west.  There are many different types of sundials. Depending on type,  your sundial may or may not read 6pm when the sun is due west.  It depends on your latitude: sundials are  latitude-specific. There's no such thing as a global sundial.  Yes, your understanding of a sundial is correct. Sundials can be  off by as much as (some number/formula) from mean solar time,  depending on your latitude. They can be as much as (some  number/formula) from clock time, depending on your longitude and  time zone.    "

1021,How can Earth-Sun Lagrange points L1 & L2 even be semi stable considering the moon?,"I know that the Earth-Sun Lagrange L1, L2, and L3 points are not considered stable over longer periods, especially when compared to L4 and L5... But, with the moon orbiting the Earth in the general path of the ecliptic, it would seem that the first time the moon got in between the Earth and the object at the L1 or L2 points, it would be enough to perturb the object a good bit, and the next lunar month would be even worse, and so on.  It seems that if the moon was taken out of the equation, the L1 and L2 points would be much more stable. And, as a result of this line of thinking, I would think that the L3 point would be much more stable than L1 and L2, since the moon would be so much farther away and unimportant, so its effect could be ignored.  Am I wrong in thinking this? Is the moon's influence not large enough to be a major factor? And, just to clarify, I am talking specifically about L1 and L2 with respect to a large 3rd body, like the moon, instead of some idealized 2 body only system. "

She did mention starting off by setting horizontal roll = 0, and then converting horizontal coordinates to galactic coordinates. The galactic roll should then take on nonzero values, which is important to the data I am analyzing.  I've read about Euler angles and quaternions and I think I'm on the right path. She provided some code for me to reference, and that uses quaternions and Euler angles. Does galactic roll refer to one of the Euler angles (perhaps [tex])? Another reference code she provided mentions parallactic angle; could that be it? Any help or reference material would be appreciated. Thank you!  (And before you mention this, yes I will ask her. I just want to give this an honest attempt first.) "

1027,Brightest Radio Source In the Universe,"I would have assumed that the brightest radio source in the Universe is a quasar of some kind (perhaps 3C 273) given that the average pulsar has luminosity of [tex] and this is the brightest (optically) and is radio loud.  My professor seems to be of the opinion that the Arecibo message is louder, but that does not seem to pass the straight face test, given that it was only transmitted at a power of only [tex], and only a very small fraction of the pulsars output (a mere [tex]th) would be sufficient to outshine the message.  Is one of these the brightest radio source in the universe (excluding the Big Bang if it matters), or is it something else entirely?  Additionally, is Watts even the right unit to be measuring this in?  Update: Here is the text of the question (it was a true/false, and the answer is true):  In 1975, Frank Drake and Carl Sagan sent a message in to the Universe, directed to extraterrestrials, from the radio telescope at Arecibo in Puerto Rico that, for a brief time, made the Earth the brightest radio object in the Universe.

1028,White Dwarf/Degenerate Gas Behaviour,"just want to try to clarify a few things about the nature of White Dwarfs and degenerate gases.  So if a white dwarf is help up by an electron degenerate gas, the electrons are unable to lose energy by emitting photons, correct? They basically are trapped at whatever energy level they occupy and that's that. The nuclei that make up the majority of the mass of the star are still constituents of a ""normal"" gas however, correct? This means that these nuclei and emit photons to lose kinetic energy? How does that work exactly? I understand that electron can emit photos inside an atom to drop to lower energy levels and that they can emit photons of any energy level if they are free (particularly if they're in a magnetic field, synchroton radiation, yeah?). To protons and neutrons do something similar? I ask because I never read anything about protons/nuclei emitting photons. If this basic picture is correct, is this the mechanism by which a white dwarf cools down over time?  Final bit, since most white dwarfs are quite hot, the peak wavelength is going to be in the UV. If I wanted to determine the percentage of such a star's luminosity that is given off in the optical, do I just need to integrate Planck's blackbody equation over the range of wavelengths I'm interested in and then compare that to the total luminosity given by [tex]?  Thanks and Cheers! "
1029,Shouldn't we not be able to see some black holes?,"Whenever there is a picture of a black hole, (even though they are artist depictions, this is how they are described) most are shown kind of in a flat disk like this.   My question is, why do we see the black hole itself? If it is sucking in material from all directions, then shouldn't the material be kind of covering the black hole, not just spinning around it to be sucked in from only the sides. Especially in the case that a star would be sucked in, then wouldn't all of its light &amp; matter in the accretion disk be encasing the black hole?  In other words, why is the accretion disk flat, and not a sphere surrounding the black hole? So if this were true, we shouldn't be able to see some black holes, only their accretion disks around them.   (unrevised/old post: If a black hole is spherical and has infinite density, then it would be sucking in objects from all directions because the gravity would be the same all around. In other words, the event horizon should be all around it!   I understand everything would orbit the black hole a little before 'falling in', but since the amount of matter and light is so large, shouldn't it encase the black hole, thus making it covered in a ball of light? The event horizon would be a shell so we could not see some black holes, which would mean there could be billions more out there.   As for the other black holes which we have seen/proven, if the information above is true, then maybe they are the result of black holes with poles with low force/gravity/magnetivity/energy. Possibly they could be a disk of some sort or have an unequal distribution of density, either of which could lead to the flat event horizon, maybe even both.   Poles on a black hole would also help account for the quasars shooting out of some. Since the gravitational pull would not be as great from the poles of a black hole, then this would allow the quasars to beam out (otherwise they would have to be going faster than the escape velocity, which is the speed of light).   Maybe the quasars are even the black holes that I was talking about earlier, and this is why you would see no event horizon, only a shell of bright light.   I am no expert in astronomy but if any of these theories sound plausible, please let me know! Just looking for some explanation, I thought of this earlier and couldn't figure it out, I could be completely wrong though. Thanks!) "
1030,How would we detect an Earth doppelganger planet?,"With our current technology, or technology available in the near future (up to 2025), how would we detect a planet exactly like our own, and how close would it have to be to be detectable?  Which methods thus far have proven the most effective for detecting Earth-like planets and what would they be able to reveal regarding our planet's atmosphere, orbital properties, and our species?    This question is interesting food for thought on both how easily an extraterrestrial civilization with comparable technology might find us, and for how easily we might find them.  For the purpose of the question we will assume that there is a planet with a civilisation with equivalent technological advancements that could exist anywhere. "
1031,Convert Ecliptic to Galactic Coordinates,"How to convert Ecliptic co-ordinates to Galactic? The wikipedia article on Celestial Coordinate systems contains various conversions, but this one is currently absent.  For a more specific example: I would like to convert Proper motion in ecliptic latitude and longitude from the ATNF catalog into proper motion in galactic coordinates. Using the following notation from the catalog documentation:  PMElong:     Proper motion in the ecliptic longitude direction (mas/yr)  PMElat:      Proper motion in ecliptic latitude (mas/yr)  ...

1034,Do hypervelocity stars have Oort clouds?,"If you had a hypervelocity star travelling through space incredibly quickly, would the hypervelocity star's Oort cloud remain intact? Would the high speed of a hypervelocity star shed the comets and dwarf planets in its Oort cloud due to the star's high speeds, or would the Oort cloud get stretched into a teardrop shape? Could the Oort cloud remain unaffected? "
1035,"What's that limit, where we start to see infrared galaxies?","All the nearby galaxies we see come in visible range, many are visible from ground based telescopes. And the farthest galaxy that hubble discovered recently, 13.4 billion light years away is in infra red. Was this Galaxy ever in visible part of spectrum?  How long will it take galaxies like andromeda or whirlpool to go infrared so that they won't be visible to us if we are not using in infraRed lens? What's the specific limit where the light makes transition from visible to infrared part of spectrum?  "
1036,How can the Earth's rotation speed up?,"It is known as a fact that Earth's rotation is slowing every year, that's why we sometimes have 61 seconds long minutes.  In the Java documentation of Time : [website]  Some computer standards are defined in terms of Greenwich mean time   (GMT), which is equivalent to universal time (UT). GMT is the ""civil""   name for the standard; UT is the ""scientific"" name for the same   standard. The distinction between UTC and UT is that UTC is based on   an atomic clock and UT is based on astronomical observations, which   for all practical purposes is an invisibly fine hair to split. Because   the earth's rotation is not uniform (it slows down and speeds up in   complicated ways), UT does not always flow uniformly. Leap seconds are   introduced as needed into UTC so as to keep UTC within 0.9 seconds of   UT1, which is a version of UT with certain corrections applied. There   are other time and date systems as well; for example, the time scale   used by the satellite-based global positioning system (GPS) is   synchronized to UTC but is not adjusted for leap seconds.     Why is that so? How can this occur? "
1037,"Without using absolute magnitudes or isochrones, how might we tell a star's age and evolutionary status?","Usual methods of estimating stellar ages involve isochrone approximations. It can also help to estimate a star's radius by correlating its absolute magnitude with effective temperature and apparent magnitude. In the absence of these measurements or observations of tell-tale variability, how might you guess a star's age and evolutionary status?  Given a single, high-resolution [tex] spectrum as your only data point, how easy is it to accurately infer the age and evolutionary status of a star? For example, how would the spectrum differ between a red dwarf and red giant, both with of [tex]? Or between two red dwarfs of ages [tex] and [tex]?  A good answer could describe how surface gravity [tex] affects spectral lines (and how this relates to stellar mass and radius), what elements we might observe more strongly at different stages of evolution, and some observational results of gyrochronology.

1039,How is the entropy of a blackhole stored at its horizon?,"I read that a blackhole has an entropy that is given by the area of its event horizon (measured in Planck units). Does that mean that this information is actually physically stored there? If yes, how can that be since there may be nothing there at all (no electrons for example that could carry this information in terms of spin up or spin down)? Is it perhaps stored in the vacuum somehow ?  "
1040,Is the Jupiter-Sun system considered a binary system of some type?,"Since Jupiter is very massive, it is the only planet (in our solar system) that has a center of mass with the Sun that lies outside the volume of the Sun. (Source)  If Jupiter was a star, they would form a « binary star ».  If the Sun was a planet, they would form a « double planet ».  Since the Sun is a star and Jupiter is a planet, does this have a particular name?  Does Jupiter have a special status or a particular effect in our solar system because of its heavy mass?  Since Jupiter-Sun's center of mass lies outside the volume of the Sun, that means that the Sun moves around that center of mass. Does this have an effect on Mercury, Venus, Earth and Mars orbits? "
1041,Do the number of moons a planet has affect the speed of the planet's rotation?,"Would the tidal forces of multiple moons interacting upon a planet speed up or slow down the day length of the planet? I was thinking that maybe the planet's day length would be slowed down due to all of the gravitational tugging, but on the other hand I was thinking that maybe all of those tidal forces could perhaps slingshot the planet ahead and make it spin at a faster rate. Would the day length even change at all? If the answer is yes, could all of those moons even affect the planet's precession? "

If so, it is possible over time that Kepler orbits can be altered by increases or decreases in the mass of of celestial bodies? For instance if ISON was in a Kepler orbit and it lost mass did it maintain its orbit and disintegrate in its orbital track or does it alter its track due to the loss of mass? "
1046,creations after supernovas,"Why is it the some massive stars go supernovae and than either form a black hole, pulsar or a magnetar. All stars essentially go through the same process when they’re alive and burning through their fuel. It almost looks as if stars create everything in the universe one way or another, is it too far-fetched to think that black holes (theortical), pulsars and magnetars to name a few, could be completely different objects? Like have we actually witnessed the creation of any of these objects?? "
1047,Why are galaxies disk shaped?,"I always see galaxies in ""disk"" shape in pictures. It is like, there is a rotational movement on a plane and the system is balanced by the pulling-in gravitational force which prevents the stars to leap out of the galaxy. What is the physical reason behind this? I have never seen a star in disk shape. A star is nothing but a much much smaller non-solid mass revolving around an axis, just like the galaxies. Does size matter? What makes the difference? Why doesn't a typical galaxy form in a spherical shape rather than a disk shape?   "
1048,How was Io not torn apart by tidal forces during its formation?,"Jupiter's moon Io is arguably one of the most volcanically active bodies in the Solar System.  The reason, according to NASA's page Scientists to Io: Your Volcanoes Are in the Wrong Place is believed to be caused by Io being     caught in a tug-of-war between Jupiter's massive gravity and the smaller but precisely timed pulls from two neighboring moons that orbit further from Jupiter – Europa and Ganymede. Io orbits faster than these other moons, completing two orbits every time Europa finishes one, and four orbits for each one Ganymede makes. This regular timing means that Io feels the strongest gravitational pull from its neighboring moons in the same orbital location, which distorts Io's orbit into an oval shape. This in turn causes Io to flex as it moves around Jupiter.    So, how did Io form in the first place, given the tidal stresses acting upon it? Does this suggest (and what evidence is there) that Io 'migrated' into its present orbit? "
1049,The CNO cycle in first generation of stars,"I'm an undergrad interested in astophysics and this question struck my mind:  As the CNO cycle requires carbon to start, and carbon is produced by thermonuclear fusion in stars, is it fair to think that the hotter stars in the first generation didn't have a CNO cycle? Or should I instead think that the first generation of stars had an initial metalicity and therefore the CNO cycle was possible? "

1052,Is there an orbit that could cause regular debris showers like in the movie Gravity?,"[some spoilers]  If you were in the ISS and orbiting the Earth roughly every 90 minutes, would it be possible for debris to be orbiting such that it passes you every 90 minutes?  While Neil DeGrass Tyson pointed out scientific flaws in the movie on twitter, he praised many things the movie got right in interviews, including ""The 90-minute orbital time for objects at that altitude.""  I think I recall an interview on a podcast that I can't remember where he specifically said that referring to the debris recurring every 90 minutes.  In reality wouldn't the debris have to be in a different orbit?  If the ISS orbits every 90 minutes (92.87 really but I'm saying 90) then after 90 minutes they would be in the same relative position.  The Earth would have rotated in the mean time so they wouldn't be over the same point on Earth, but they would be in the same position in orbit about the Earth.  Is there an orbit that would allow the same debris to cross the same spot in their orbit every 90 minutes?  Would it be nearly the same orbit, just inclined slightly?  Would that explain why the debris was moving so slowly relative to the ISS as well?  note:  There are problems with the orbits and location in the movie, I simplified my question to ask about the particular orbit of the ISS.

1055,If I had a horseshoe orbit of two moons...,"Consider an Earth-like planet, with two moons. I guess the two moons would have to be smaller than our own, for the system to be stable. Is that stable? I did some research, and apparently Janus and Epimetheus (Saturn moons that are in a horseshoe orbit) are like that, but I don't know how their cycles work, or how they look from Saturn.   Hence,:    Would a moon have to be smaller that the other one, or would both have to be the same size?  Would both have the same cycle?  How could nights be seen from the Earth?    I'm looking for that sort of answer.  Thanks in advance! :)  "
1056,Geographical Point of the Sun,"I want to draw a Sun in a 3d scene, so I figured the easiest way would be to calculate the latitude and longitude of the point perpendicular to Sun position and then just move it ""up"".  As a starting point, I want to calculate it's equatorial coordinates: declination and right ascension.  I followed instructions from this page, also cross-referencing with this one  Here's my code (in Swift):  import Foundation  class Astronomy {    static func julianDays(since: Date) -&gt; Double {     return since.timeIntervalSince1970 / 86400 + 2440587.5   }    static func daysSinceJ2000(for date: Date) -&gt; Double {     return julianDays(since: date) - 2451545   }    static func sunAxialTilt(for daysSinceJ200: Double) -&gt; Double {     return 23.4393 - 3.563e-7 * daysSinceJ200   }    static func sunEquatorialPosition(on date: Date) -&gt; (declination: Double, RA: Double, distance: Double) {     let daysSinceGreenwichNoon = daysSinceJ2000(for: date)     var meanLongitude = 280.460 + 0.9856474*daysSinceGreenwichNoon     var meanAnomaly = 357.528 + 0.9856003*daysSinceGreenwichNoon     meanLongitude = meanLongitude.rangedUpTo360     meanAnomaly = meanAnomaly.rangedUpTo360     let eclipticLongitude = meanLongitude + 1.915*sin(meanAnomaly.radians) + 0.020*sin(2*meanAnomaly.radians)      let distanceToEarth = 1.00014 - 0.01671*cos(meanAnomaly.radians) - 0.00014*cos(2*meanAnomaly.radians)      let axialTilt = sunAxialTilt(for: daysSinceGreenwichNoon)     let rightAscension = atan2(cos(axialTilt.radians)*sin(eclipticLongitude.radians), cos(eclipticLongitude.radians))     let declination = asin(sin(axialTilt.radians)*sin(eclipticLongitude.radians))      return (declination: declination.degrees, RA: rightAscension.degrees, distance: distanceToEarth)   } }  extension Double {   var radians: Double {     return self * .pi / 180   }    var degrees: Double {     return self  * 180 / .pi   }    var rangedUpTo360: Double {     let multiples = (self/360).rounded(.down)     return self - 360*multiples   } }   However, it does not seem to be working correctly. As of the time I write this article, the result is declination -16.98772292697088, RA -44.80674952684117. Compared with [website]What went wrong?  Edit: As it turned out nothing was wrong, I can get to the second part: calculating the geographical point. (the title suggests it after all)  AFAIK for latitude, I can use declination as is and for longitude, I  need to calculate Greenwich Hour Angle(GHA)  After examining several articles, I found these equations:  SHA[°] = 360 – 15 · RA[h]  GHAAries[°] = 15 · GST[h]  GHA = SHA + GHAAries    For my case, I suppose I may use RA as is, without multiplying its hour component by 15. What keeps me a bit puzzled is GST:   May I use Greenwich Mean Sidereal Time instead if I don't need the calculations to be super precise? Is there any ""GST for dummies""? All the calculations I found rely on some floating second offset, I found this table but have no idea how to use it.  "

1059,At what distance from Earth would our Sun be the same apparent magnitude as the next brightest star in the sky?,"When I stand outside looking at the night sky, to my untrained eye, everything except the moon looks like a star.  I know intellectually that some are planets circling our sun, and some are entire galaxies far away, but they all look basically the same.  How far out do you have be be from our sun for it to appear the same as any other 'star' in the sky?   Edit to clarify  As we migrate out through the solar system, when we look up to the sky the sun will get dimmer the farther away we get. On earth there is no doubt which star is our sun.   As we occupy bodies in the solar system farther from the sun, where will we be when the sun appears to be the same brightness as any other star in the sky?  "

What I was thinking was that more moons would mean more tidal effect would be seen even if distance from sun has increased.  But then I thought that the moons of Neptune would all have different orbits and different time periods of rotation.

Many kinds of life are based on air and sun. Animals have to breathe oxygen, plants need the sun, and both need water. But there are many other kinds of life on Earth, like:   Very deep seawater life that lives under high pressure and without sunlight, extremophile organisms that live in very hot water, weird ""arsenic life"" which was debunked as being fully arsenic-based, but turned out to be something different...

1069,Hypothetical trans-Neptunian planets orbiting the Sun,"The planet HD 106906 b was found at 650 AU from its home star, a star not so different from the Sun. Fomalhaut b is also a young planet that is orbiting very far away from its star.  These two planets were discovered mainly because they are young enough to still be hot enough to be seen in the infrared. I think that old planets in very high orbits would have temperatures below 10K, and thus be black and invisible.  Some people agree with the hypothesis that, in our Solar System, somewhere out beyond Neptune, some non-dwarf planets might be orbiting the Sun. The existence of HD 106906 b and Fomalhaut b suggests that this is possible. What are the odds that we could find at least one of these planets in our Solar System?

I mean, how will they vary in properties?  "
1071,Can a telescope detect a blackbody?,"I'd like to determine the distance at which a telescope with a certain set of parameters (sensitivity, collector area) can detect a blackbody with certain other parameters (temperature, emitting area).  For example, let us suppose we have an infrared telescope with a sensitivity of '1Jy/sr' and a collector area of 10m^2 at a distance D from a 300m^2 perfectly black body at a temperature of 30 Kelvin.   How do I determine D? What additional information do I need to perform the calculation? "
1072,Are there any alternative explanations for the gravitational force we attribute to dark matter?,"It always seemed counter-intuitive to me that we observed an measured a gravitational force and since the universe has not enough mass to account for it, the conclusion was to say there's a different kind of matter wich doesn't interact with ordinary matter nor can be seen o measured.  What if the force was applied by other adjacent or overlapsed universes or by something completely different? Are there any other theories propossed? or would we just call whatever we find out to be the source of this force ""Dark matter"" even if it´s nothing alike matter? "
1073,How do we know that an exoplanet is tidally locked to the parent star?,"Often in discussing exoplanets we hear that they are close to the parent star (usually a red dwarf) but then there's a caveat that the planet is tidally locked to that star and that that fact severely decreases prospects for that planet to harbor life.  But how do we know that an exoplanet is tidally locked to a star? I doubt that we can directly observe the rotation of that planet. Does that mean that we conclude that it's tidally locked because that's what our theoretical models tell us, and not that we observe it directly? "
1074,How do scientists know there are about 300 billion stars in a galaxy and there are about 100 billion galaxies?,Just to think about this is mind boggling. But how do scientist get these numbers? What technology/system/theory do they they use? 
1075,Is the Cosmos a super set of the Universe and any hypothetical multiverse(s)?,"I'm quite lost on the definitions of words like omniverse, megaverse, multiverse, meta-universe, universe, and cosmos. I used to think the Universe and the Cosmos were essentially the same things, but now I'm reading the latter is an orderly system (not sure what's meant by that).  Can somebody help me understand what they each represent? In 1980, Carl Sagan said ""The cosmos is all that is, or ever was, or ever will be."" This sounds like the Cosmos would be the greatest of all and all else would fall into that. Would it be accurate, for example, to say Cosmos > Multiverse > Universe? What about the other things I mentioned earlier? "
1076,Natural units of star clusters angular momentum and energy,"I'm calculating the total angular momentum of a bunch of theoretical stars of a few solar masses, separated by a few light years, moving at velocities of about a few dozens of km / sec.  Mechanical angular momentum relative to an arbitrary origin (the cluster's center of mass is a good choice) is this : \begin{equation} \vec{L} = \sum_i \vec{r}_i \times m_i \, \vec{v}_i, \end{equation} so the SI units are [tex].  But in real astronomy, what should be the most simple/natural units for star clusters ?  [tex] ?  What are the angular momentum units used by astronomers ?  And what about energy units for a cluster of stars ?  I'm interested in kinematical energy and gravitationnal potential energy of the whole cluster.  Certainly not joules !?  And [tex] would certainly be too much, I suppose ! "
1077,Seeing a galaxy (quasar) greater than 46.6 billion light years away,"Assuming the Big Bang was 13.8 Billion Years ago: Is it possible to observe a Galaxy's redshift showing distances slightly greater than that, like 48 Billion Light Years away? I understand that in a static universe, light traveling in a straight line would only be visible at less than 46.6 Bly. But, can Hubble's constant distort this number? Also, do we assume some error due to the light taking a non-linear path because of lensing? If so, is it possible to have an error of several hundred million years? "
1078,How to build a powerful home made telescope,"Simple, I fell in love with the sky when my parents were constructing our new house I was a kid then and one day I ventured out on the terrace, to my amazement it was a full moon, ever since I've felt spiritually connected with the Universe. Its been around 20 years since that day, out of my busy schedule I looked at the stars yesterday, I found love again! Wanted to buy the best telescope out there, but its out of my pocket.   Want to build a home made powerful telescope? Any help fellow sky lovers and star chasers?  "
1079,Detection of exo-planets,"One method used for detecting exo-planets is to look for a slight dip in the parent star's luminosity as the planet transits the stellar disc. Intuitively, it seems to me that if planetary systems in our galactic neighborhood are randomly oriented, there would have to be a very large proportion of them in which transits can never happen from Earth's viewpoint. Perhaps, however, the assumption of random orientation is incorrect, and there is some alignment of the axes of rotation of planetary systems, which would facilitate detection of planets in some preferred plane (the galactic plane?).  In popular presentations concerning the search for exo-planets, I have never seen this issue addressed. What observations and/or assumptions are used in arriving at a realistic estimate of the number of exo-planets in our region of the galaxy?  (There are related questions in this forum, but I haven't found one that asks about the possible alignment of the axes of rotation.) "
1080,Why did the distribution of asteroids discovered in 2010 have a radial modulation?,"This answer links to one of Scott Manley's excellent asteroid videos Asteroid Discovery - 1970-2015 - 8K resolution. The animation highlights the positions of the meteors at the moment of their discovery, and by watching one can see the technology improve and notice patterns as instruments are pointed in different directions to avoid the light from the Sun and (at least sometimes) the Moon. (there is music, adjust volume accordingly)  There are often fan-shaped patterns showing the directions that more sensitive telescopes with modest fields of view are pointed.  However, I noticed that only during the year 2010, roughly between asteroid numbers 500,000 and 520,000 there are radial striations at certain distances from the Sun. I don't see this happen at any other time during the video.  Is this just a rendering artifact, or is it real? If real, what would cause the periodic radial modulation of sensitivity, and only in 2010?  note 1: YouTube allows for playback rates between 25% and 200%, and variable video resolutions. I found 25% and 1080p optimal for my current internet connection and screen.  note 2: For those with GIFs disabled, one image is a GIF.  note 3: 2nd image contains several cropped screenshots highlighting the ""periodic radial modulation of sensitivity"" in asteroid detection during 2010, for clarification purposes.

1081,"Stellar nurseries in the ""Shedding New Light on the Whirlpool Galaxy"" video","Captions in the Hubble Space Telescope YouTube channel video Shedding New Light on the Whirlpool Galaxy say:     (visible) Along the dark dust lanes, bright pink nebulae are the birthplace of new stars.      (X-ray, lower energy) Before leaving these stellar nurseries, the most massive stars die in supernova explosions, which heat the surrounding gas to X-ray temperatures.   I'm not very familliar with star formation processes.   These might be considered as separate questions, but I've put them here together because they all refer to the same two sentences in this video, and it's likely that those familliar with nurseries, or wanting to know more about them, will have something to say or learn about all three.   Do stars tend to leave ""these stellar nurseries"" after a while, and it's only the short lifetime of the most massive stars that keeps them from leaving before going supernova? What impact does the heating of surrounding gas to X-ray temperatures have on the formation and evolution of other stars within a given ""nursery""? Are there really such things as spatially well defined ""nurseries""? Are they distinct and roughly countable, or is this a subjective popular term? Can one point to something and say ""this little blob here at x, y, z in the spiral arm of the Whirlpool Galaxy, it's a classic nursery""?      "
1082,Is albedo ever greater than unity? How is it calculated for various surface diffusivities and specular reflection?,"I'm trying to understand how albedo would be calculated for a body with well-characterized surface reflectance properties, so that it's absolute magnitude could be defined. One could argue that this is going backwards (one should measure apparent magnitude, correct for distances and phase angle to extract absolute magnitude, correct for radius to extract albedo) but consider if the body were not smooth and diffusely reflecting.  Imagine two identically sized spherical bodies; one diffuse or matte white and the other somehow covered in liquid mercury and exhibiting specular rather than diffuse reflectivity, with no wind or waves.  Would they both have albedo of unity?  If these two reflective bodies were very irregularly-shaped and had an extremely large, flattened (much larger radius of curvature) face, would its albedo be larger than unity at times?  Here I'm looking for how astronomers and planetary scientists use the term albedo and not just a mathematical hypothesis. There may be ways this is dealt with practically. "
1083,Power requirement for transmitting communications further than 1 ly?,"The StarShot project from Breakthrough Initiatives aims to send a paper light spacecraft to alpha centauri using pressure from a laser located on earth at 20,000kms.   What are the options for a transmitter that can be received from 1-4 lyrs away, if the transmitter weighs the same as a few jellybeans (&lt;10 grams)? What wavelength and power range can they work with for that distance using that weight of equipment? "
1084,"How does one ""use"" the Pan-Starrs data?","I've seen that a large block of Pan-Starrs data has been released and is available on-line and how the distributors of the data expect professionals and the general public to use the data in their research. I am part of the general public and was wondering how accessible the data actually is?  For instance if i were interested in searching a small section of sky for a moving object, i would need multiple ""photos"" ""data sets""? over time in order to see the movement.  Would special software be required? How would one even start the process? "
1085,How can ionized emission line flux decrease as a function of increasing metallicity or abundance?,"The chemical evolution of galaxies is an important way to learn about their formation and stellar/gaseous constituents. Many galaxies show narrow emission lines at optical wavelengths (3500-9000 Angstroms) from ionized elements (e.g., [O II] at 3727 Angstroms) and recombination Balmer lines (e.g., H[tex] at 6563 Angstroms). The origin of the ionized emission line flux can depend on the amount of the element present in the galaxy, and also on the nature of the ionizing source (i.e., the oft-mentioned ""shape of the ionizing spectrum"").  I have a few questions that I cannot seem to find clear answers to in textbooks, publications and review papers. My main reference for the following facts/questions is Kewley &amp; Dopita 2002, ApJS, 142.    What is the difference between metallicity and abundance, and what impact would these two parameters have on the ionized emission line flux from a galaxy (assuming that the ionizing spectrum is kept constant)? There are claims that some ionized lines (e.g., the auroral line [O III] at 4363 Angstroms) would become much weaker as the metallicity increases. Why? I would think that higher metallicity means more Oxygen and, assuming we keep the ionization spectrum fixed, more likely for more [O III] to exist. Should this not increase the [O III] 4363AA flux?  Similarly, some excitation line ratios (e.g., ([O II] 3727 + [O III] 5007)/H[tex], commonly known as [tex]) are known to decrease with increasing abundance (measured via log(O/H)+12). Again, why? I would think if the metallicity or oxygen abundance is higher, then there is an increased chance of getting more [O II] and [O III] emission. Also, assuming that metallicity is higher, the amount of hydrogen should decrease, and this would decrease the [tex] flux in the [tex] ratio above, thus increasing the ratio at high abundance.   "
1086,Evidence of CMB redshift,"Are there any known spectral lines shifted by ~1100? If not, then how certain is mainstream that the CMB has a redshift of ~1100? All I see is a blackbody radiation curve void of spectral lines. "
1087,What is Earth believed to have looked like before the collision with Theia?,"Let's assume the moon was formed because Earth collided into Theia. (There are numerous other theories, but this one is the most widely accepted.)  In that case, are there theories that address what the Earth surface looked like? E.g. would the Earth have had bodies of water at the time?   I've read some websites and a book!, and some say it did, some say it did not. "
1088,Spacing (2422 days) between solar eclipses - unrelated saros numbers,"I just made an observation that is very puzzling.  The observation concerns total solar eclipses and their spacing in time.  I know that the saros cycle dictates recurrence of same saros eclipses roughly every 18 yrs 11 days apart.  However, the two American eclipses (Aug 21, 2017 and Apr 8, 2024) are spaced by 2422 days.  These are saros 145 and 139 respectively - seemingly unrelated eclipses.  There is another pair of eclipses that are upcoming (Aug 2, 2027 and Mar 20, 2034), and they are also spaced exactly 2422 days apart.  These are saros 136 and 130 respectively.  Again, they are unrelated eclipses from each other - OK expected.  The only thing that these two pairs of eclipses have in common is that their paths CROSS each other 2422 days apart. So, here is my question:  Why are these two pairs of totally unrelated eclipses ""dancing"" with each other with exactly the same spacing of 2422 days?  What mathematical phenomena could account for this?   Thank you for your time. "
1089,A good place to start?,"I am a high school student (going into 11th grade next year), who will be taking an introduction to astronomy and astrophysics as part of my core curriculum. As such, I would like to get a head start now, but I am not sure where to start.  Are there any specific learning resources that are recommended? Books, videos, documentaries?  "
1090,How well is Earth’s motion through the universe quantified?,"If I had a time travel machine that could drop me into any point in space and time, could I accurately predict earth’s “position”?  I know position is an improper term.  Would it be possible to know exactly where to land so that you are at the same spot on the surface of Earth as when you “departed”? "
1091,Did Eudoxus describe the eclipitic on his sun motion model?,"In the description of Eudoxus’s model for the sun he says one the three circles which describe solar motion is “the circle which runs along the middle of the zodiac”. Does this refer to the ecliptic plane? What I thought is that it does mean the same thing as the ecliptic, which as seen from earth when looking up to the night sky, appears as if it cuts the zodiac in the middle. In a spherical model, the Sun’s apparent movement can be described as running along the constellations of the zodiac throughout the year on a “circle” which is known as the ecliptic.   Am I getting this wrong? "
1092,How can apparent magnitude be negative?,What is the reason for that scale? Is it because otherwise defining an maximum would be too hard(?). Why do objects that are (apparently) brighter get assigned a smaller number (and down to negative)? 
1093,"What telescope is this, and how does it work?","In the excellent chemistry series of Periodic Videos' episode Amazing piece of metal (speculum) there is an interesting showing and discussion of Isaac Newton's first telescope.   At 02:36 there is a short cut to a view of a very large, modern telescope mirror. I'm confused by the image because it seems to show what looks like a small 45 degree elliptical, diagonal secondary mirror that you might see near the top end of a long focal length Newtonian telescope, except that it seems to be sitting in front of the primary, facing towards the stars.  Can anyone identify this telescope, and help me understand the basics of how this particular optical system is configured?  edit: I was so focused on the small mirror in the center that I neglected to read the caption. This ""very large telescope"" may in fact be THE Very Large Telescope, one of it's components at least. But because of all the shiny metal an reflections in mirrors, I still don't really understand what I'm looking at as far as the optical system is configured.    [website]"
1094,Are there any electrons inside the sun / a star?,"Like the question says, are there electrons inside an active star, or has all the matter been so thoroughly ionized / plasmarized that the electrons are long gone? I ask because it would make sense when thinking about the magnetic field of a star; naked protons (neutrons are of no magnetic concern) would create a very one-way magnetic effect when circling inside the star, while protons + electrons would seem to counteract one another, magnetically.  Come to think of it, I guess the same question could be asked for the Earth's liquid core, considering its temperatures...? "
1095,Expanding universe,"If the first stars in the universe were formed 400 million years after the big bang, and the universe is expanding, should that stars at that time not been in our cosmic backyard?  And should their light not have reached earth much sooner? "
1096,What is main radiative mechanism in Gunn-Peterson effect?,"I'm having a hard time understanding the Gunn-Peterson effect and the Ly-alpha line and I've written a couple of questions below.   The trough we see in the spectra of quasars is the Gunn-Peterson trough, right? Does this trough have to start from the Ly-alpha line?  If neutral hydrogen along the line of sight to the distant quasar is few, do we expect the Ly-alpha forest to be sparse?  What is the main radiative mechanism in the Gunn-Peterson effect? "
1097,Why would astronomers want to eclipse the Sun?,"I've heard that some astronomers are building an artifical solar-eclipse ship, that should help us to dim the diffraction of the Sun.  Why don't we just wait till night? What is the function of the eclipse-ship really? "
1098,What is the temperature under the surface of Mercury?,"What is the temperature under the surface of Mercury?  I know at the surface the temperature varies greatly (-297 F to 801 F).  I also realize that the answer would likely depend on depth.  Do we know the temperature at any depth, except the surface?  I also realize the temperature may vary based on latitude.  I am mainly looking to see if there might be an ideal location / depth for a colony on Mercury for my game Planetary Settlers. "
1099,Radio telescope targeting,How do you target a radio telescope on the precise object you wish to observe? You can point it in the general direction but how do you get the information from the exact point in the sky that you are investigating? This seems self evident with an optical telescope but not with a radio telescope. 
1100,Theoretically what happens to a black hole that evaporates?,"Theoretically, does an evaporating black hole remain a black hole until it evaporates to nothing? Or does it change into something else once it evaporates to below a certain mass? "
1101,Why does shell fusion produce more energy than core fusion?,"Stars go from the main sequence phase to the red giant branch due to the depletion of hydrogen in the core. As a result, the star contracts and shell hydrogen fusion begins, which apparently produces much more energy. Why does this produce more energy than core hydrogen fusion? The Wikipedia article on red giants says that this is because of higher temperatures, but why does shell hydrogen fusion occur at higher temperatures than core hydrogen fusion?  After the helium flash in low-medium mass stars, does shell hydrogen fusion continue to occur? If so, then why does there a drop in luminosity from the helium flash to the horizontal branch? And if not, then why not?  Similarly to the first question, in the AGB phase, why does shell helium fusion produce so much more energy than core fusion?  Why does the early AGB phase derive most of its energy from shell helium fusion and not shell hydrogen fusion? "
1102,What variables are needed to calculate simple horseshoe orbit times?,"EDIT This was NOT a duplicate of Horseshoe orbit cycle times.  But that other question has been deleted, regardless. My original question asked for the answer to the equation(s), and provides many of the variables.  But since no one was apparently willing/able to answer it, this new question asks only for the form of the equation(s) itself and a list of variables involved, so that I can either provide more information on a future question, or try and solve the equations myself (though I doubt my math ability to do that, hence the original question, if I know what equations and variables are involved I can at least make an attempt myself).  What variables need to be known in order to calculate a horseshoe orbit cycle time?    In other words: What is the equation, and what do the variables in that equation represent (speed? mass? semi major axes? etc.), to calculate the time it takes for an object to go from Point A on that image, through Points B, C, D, and E and back to A, along the light blue line in the image above (image also available here)?  For example, Earth and Cruithne complete their cycle in 770 years, while Janus and Epimetheus complete theirs in 8 years.  I'm confident that semi-major axes are key factors in the equation, but I don't know what other variables are included, or how the variables relate to each other in the calculation.    Also, I understand that these orbits are not stable, in the long term, and that my example of Cruithne is especially complex, as it will actually change orbit types periodically, and will likely be ejected from the solar system entirely, or impact the Sun or Jupiter, at some point.  But those complexities are for another time.  For this question, I just want to know the equation in its simplest form.  "
1103,Conceptual Doubt regarding the calculation of the Solar Constant,"   The Solar constant is the intensity of the solar radiation in the   upper atmosphere. It's value is about [tex] [tex].   Now we begin by stating that the Power radiated by the sun is about [tex]W. Then we using the Formula [tex], we compute the Intensity. (Here d is [tex]m).   I understand the mathematics but have trouble in interpreting the meaning of the solar constant. The Intensity formula used above is generally depicted by authors as follows (as per my understanding): There is a sphere around the Sun of radius [tex] and if the power is radiated equally in all directions then each point on the Sphere receives an Intensity [tex]. But the Earth is not a point object, so is this assumption valid?   Next, what do you mean by the upper atmosphere? I've come across another version:      The Solar constant is the intensity of the solar radiation in when the sun is directly overhead. It's value is about [tex] [tex].   I guess my confusion is due to a lack of an intuitive understanding of this concept and I would be grateful if anyone could provide me with one.  "
1104,Can two planets in an empty universe meet/be pulled together?,"For this question assume that the entire universe is completely empty. The universe is not expanding or contracting, it is completely motionless since time immemorial and has never moved before.  Only two identical earths without moon are left in this entire universe and they are 5 billion light years apart. From their starting position the earths do not spin or move at all they are completely motionless.  Would these planets ever meet or at least be pulled together?  Or are the their respective gravities too small to have any meaningful effect? "
1105,Strange behaviour of black holes,"We know black holes emit streams of radiation ,also recently discovered that they emit visible light when they eat any nearby matter .

Choi at Space.com.           But it is different from what we normally hear that neither matter nor radiation can escape from black holes.  So what's the reason for this.?? "
1106,"V838 Monocerotis ""light-echo"" images morphed into nice video, but why so few original images?","This NYTimes video shows what I think is a series of real Hubble images which have been ""morphed"" artistically to appear to be continuously expanding. (also see The V838 Monocerotis Star Still Has Astronomers’ Heads Exploding) If I understand correctly it is the light-echo, not actual material that is doing the expanding at this rate. They also give four discrete images available in 2006 (shown below) and you can find a link to a video there which also seems to be made of just four images.  This is (very roughly speaking) tomography of the cloud - the parabolic ""shell of reflection"" expands and each image highlights a view of the material in that shell. That seems to be what the diagram illustrates.  my question is: why weren't there more images taken of this - technically speaking - awesome event, enough to make an animation without the artistic ""morphing""?   note: I'm not asking ""why do you think there weren't..."". I'm looking for the actual reason. Are these ""found images"" - nobody thought of doing it and later just pulled these from archives, or where these thought to be sufficient? Are there more images available?  Here are some links to video I have found  YouTube: ""Hubble: Timelapse of V838 Monocerotis (2002-2006)""  [website]...which can also be seen at spacetelescope.org  [website]... and this Wikipedia article links to this video  [website]and here are some ""stills""  Images from NYTimes   "
1107,Why is this HST WFPC2 image so much fuzzier than the WFC3 image of the same field?,"I was looking at the comparison of 2007 and 2015 HST images of the ""disappearing"" star N6946-BH1 in Phys.org's article Collapsing star gives birth to a black hole. The 2007 images is from the WFPC2 while the one from 2015 is from WFC3.  I wondered why the WFPC2 image is substantially fuzzier than that from WFC3. I looked at the WFPC2 manual for cycle 17 and found it has the ""L-shaped"" detector. Three quadrants have CCD elements with pixel spacing of 0.1 arcsec, the fourth ""planetary"" array has a pixel spacing of 0.046. However it seems more complicated because - if I understand correctly - there are different focal ratios used for the two.     The WFPC2 field-of-view is divided into four cameras by a four-faceted   pyramid mirror near the HST focal plane. Each of the four cameras   contains an 800x800 pixel Loral CCD detector. Three cameras operate at   an image scale of 0.1″ per pixel (F/12.9) and comprise the Wide Field   Camera (WFC) with an “L” shaped field-of-view. The fourth camera   operates at 0.046″ per pixel (F/28.3) and is referred to as the Planetary   Camera (PC).    However, while the WFC3 manual for cycle 23 gives the pixel spacing as      Table 5.1: WFC3 Detector Characteristics       0.04″ per pixel    I didn't find a focal ratio.  I'd like to understand why the 2007 image is so ""gaussian fuzzy"". If it were only because of larger pixel spacing it would look more blockish or pixellated. Does this mean it was using a different optical path with lower optical resolution? Is the 2007 image from the WFC part at F/12.9? Does the WFC3 use F/28.3?   I also don't understand the optical reason why different paths would have different optical resolutions. This would not come from different Airy disks from simple diffraction - the angular size would be unchanged.      above: cropped sections from the same image shown below.    above: From here. "
1108,Direction of Earth’s poles relative to the Sun’s movement around the Galaxy,"The plane of the solar system is at 63 degrees to the plane of the galaxy, then either the North or South Pole of Earth would be on the ‘leading edge,’ i.e. pointing roughly in the direction of movement around the galaxy (+/-23.5 degrees depending on the direction of the tilt of the earth at the time). Would there be any effect on the atmosphere at the front of this direction of travel caused by additional collision / friction with space dust or solar wind? For example, if the South Pole was on the leading edge, could something like the ozone hole be exacerbated by interstellar particles, or could the auroras be more spectacular at the pole that points forwards? If so, is there evidence of seasonal variation in these effects as the tilt of the earth increases or decreases that pole’s angle towards the direction of the sun’s movement along the galactic plane?    Also, would the plane of the planets be shifted slightly to the rear of the midline of the sun because the sun is, in effect, dragging them behind it?  Finally, is there any evidence of increase or decrease in the above postulated effect depending on whether the solar system is above or below the galactic plane during its 30 million year oscillation? E.g. if there were more interstellar dust while passing through the mid-plane, would that leave a 30 million year signature in polar ice-core samples? "

1110,Helium in terrestrial planet atmospheres?,"When you look at effective temperature ranges and escape velocities of planets, there is a ""population"" where hydrogen escapes, but helium doesn't. Is it feasible that there may be planets less that about 10 Earth masses (not gas giants) with a predominantly helium atmosphere??  Another way of asking this question would be: Do any models show terrestrial planets retaining a primordial atmosphere or is expected that most all will be secondary? I am guessing that very little helium is ""outgassed"", whereas hydrogen can be added to an atmosphere by photodissociation and other processes. I know that early star UV emissions, collisions, etc. will probably strip a ""close in"" planet's original atmospheres. "
1111,"In rocky planets,does fast rotation cause flatting or low flatting imply slow rotation?","As far as I know, Venus and Mercury have 0 flatting, but Mars and Earth have detectable flatting, and Venus and Mercury are both rotating slowly.

1112,Can the explanation of Tabby's star KIC 8462852 be an intervening planet in orbit around another star?,"Can an intervening planet in orbit around a nearby star cause periodic occultation?  Please excuse the crude text graphics:  Tabby ...... PlanetP ......................................... Earth                 |              StarX    StarX and Tabby's star are close to each other (maybe part of some local cluster, like the Centauri brothers) so the line of sight with our Sun/Earth has maintained over the recent handful of years. PlanetP orbits StarX with a period of around 750 Earth days.  Its ecliptic is at an angle (somewhat perpendicular) to the line of sight with Earth. PlanetP's orbit rotates (precession?) a bit around StarX, so the amount of occultation of Tabby's star by PlanetP varies from 15% to 22% to whatever.  "

1114,What could be a star-like object that shines at daytime for few seconds? What's the probability to see it?,"Some years ago I looked up to the blue sky, around 2 PM, and I saw, for 2 or 3 seconds, something like a star fading out. Could it be a Supernova or another phenomena? Is it highly possible? "
1115,Did I see a mentionable event in Germany early morning on 6th of February 2019?,"Around 6.15am (GMT + 1) on the 6th of February 2019 I  was looking out of my window somewhat north, when I saw something one would probably call a shooting star. The features were:   A magnitude I haven't seen before; it even had a soft blinding effect, that's how bright it was. From my view frame it moved from my right to my left (so most likely from east to west).  The size was a quarter to half of what the moon usually has from my view frame. It traveled almost through the sky half I was able to see within half a second before its glow was immediately gone again.    I am assuming the object must have been either very large and fast or quite close.  Was there any meteor worthy mentioning passing by Earth at that given time? Or are the features I just described way more common than I am assuming, and I just spotted an event that happens quite regularly? "
1116,Does this video catch an Eta Aquarid - Earth skimming meteor?,"I did a time-lapse animation looking towards the sunrise from Sydney, Australia on 25th of April.  You can see it here around 1m 25s in (that link should jump to just before it appears very near where the Sun is about to rise):  [website]It then proceeds towards the right of screen over around the next 21 seconds (around 10&#189; minutes) before disappearing off the right. You might need to send the video to full screen to see the small white 'bullet of haze' that is moving against a very wide background.  One of my first thoughts was that it might be a meteor skimming the upper atmosphere, but I was less confident of that given it seemed to be coming from the general direction of the Sun, and I'd thought that was a direction unlikely to produce meteors.   That was until I read Eta Aquarid Meteor Shower in 2016 which states:     The best time to view the Eta Aquarids is in the early mornings, right before dawn.   Well, at least that pins down the same time of day, if not the direction from which it came.  What is the likelyhood that this feature is a piece of comet debris that skimmed Earth's atmosphere? "
1117,Is the Sun prograde or retrograde with respect to the rotation of the Milky Way?,"I recently learned about the terms prograde and retrograde. I've seen these terms used to describe the rotations and orbits of moons with respect to their planet, and planets with respect to their star. But I haven't been able to find what the relationship is between the rotation and orbit of the Sun with respect to the rotation of the Milky Way.  So, basically what I'm trying to do here is ask two questions:   Is the orbit of the Sun around the center of the Milky Way prograde or retrograde with respect to the rotation of the Milky Way? Is the axial rotation of the Sun prograde or retrograde with respect to the rotation of the Milky Way?   Regarding question #2, I know it might be considered a slightly weird question to ask, simply because the plane of the Solar System is significantly tilted relative to the plane of the Milky Way (by about 60°), and furthermore the Sun itself has its equatorial plane tilted by a few more degrees relative to the plane of the Solar System (about 7°). But if we mentally ""flatten out"" the Solar System such that the Sun's equatorial plane aligns with the plane of the Milky Way, then we can talk about whether its axial rotation is in the same direction as the rotation of the Milky Way, so I think this is a valid application of the concept. "
1118,Are there any ways in which the light time difference between the center and the edge of the solar disk is noticeable?,"In the ABC News video New space discovery has astronomers buzzing at about 02:30 Dr. Hakeem M. Oluseyi explains that the shortness of FRBs (before dispersion) suggests a compact source size and illustrates this by using the Sun as an example.   I'd never though about this until just now, but the radius of the Sun is indeed about 2.3 light-seconds. It takes light from the edge of the Sun's disk over 2 seconds longer to reach us than light from the central area.  Are there any ways in which this light time difference is noticeable, or needs to be taken into account? "
1119,What is the equation of state for a relativistic fluid/gas?,"Say we have a relativistic fluid/gas, as we have in some astrophyical systems.  Now let us write:   [tex] - energy density in the fluid's rest frame. [tex] - pressure in the fluid's rest frame. [tex] - number density in the fluid's rest frame. [tex] - mass of the particles.   I know that for the non-relativistic case we have:  [tex]  where [tex] is the adiabatic index. [tex] for a gas with [tex] degrees of freedom.  For the ultra-relativstic case we have:  [tex]  My question is what is [tex] for a relativstic case (which is the general case of the 2 limits shown above)? I would also like to know how to derive it.    Is the following way the correct way to do it ? :  The number density of particles is: [tex]  The pressure is: [tex]  The energy density is: [tex]  where:  [tex]  Here [tex] is the spin of the particles, for electrons [tex].  [tex]  [tex]  From calculating the three integrals above we can finally obtain [tex].   Can anyone confirm this is the proper way to do it, or am I missing something here? It seems as if those integrals cannot be solved analytically - is this true? Perhaps in this case there is no explicit formula for [tex]?  "
1120,Just how fast is a Fast Radio Burst thought to be?,"According to Wikipedia;s Fast Radio Bursts; Frequencies and dispersion are recorded they      The component frequencies of each burst are delayed by different amounts of time depending on the wavelength. This delay is described by a value referred to as a dispersion measure (DM). This results in a received signal that sweeps rapidly down in frequency, as longer wavelengths are delayed more.   The time between the arrival of the pulse at two different frequencies can be used to generate a kind of measure of distance, based on a dispersion constant. The measure does not have units of length, but of integrated electron density over the path from source to observer.  Using some fancy Fourier tricks one could first undo the [tex] delay and then try to reconstruct what the original pulse might have looked like before dispersion.  Has this been done? If so, how fast (narrow in time) might the original disturbance be? A millisecond? Less? "
1121,What does the Sun's orbit within the Solar System look like?,"Everything in the Solar System revolves around the ""barycenter"": the overall center of mass. This barycenter is not in the center of the Sun. Some articles and essays I've read go so far as to suggest that the position of the barycenter does not have a set of fixed coordinates within the System: it fluctuates.   Well. Since everything, including the Sun, revolves around this barycenter, the Sun must have its own orbit around it. What does it look like? How large is it? How elliptic?  (In my research, I have tried and failed to establish whether the barycenter is within the Sun or outside it. Either way, an orbit is an orbit). "
1122,"""Up"" and ""down"" in Space","From my understanding, ""up"" and ""down"" in space is going towards (down) an object's gravitational pull or (up) which is going away from it. I get confused with this explanation, and I believe simply because of how we perceive up and down here on earth.   My question(s) is this: Can we go in all directions in space with the ""Earth"" interpretation of up, down, left, right, north west, south east, etc if we can get past gravitational pulls of objects in space?    Looking at my Gimp version of the universe, I have the Earth and stars. So going up would essentially be go towards any of the stars in the picture that has the strongest gravitational pull, although each object are on different planes?  In relation to my question above, I have imagined Earth in space as to like the 10 floor on an infinite elevator that can go in all directions. Say we can somehow go through star A and escape it's gravitational pull, we would be essentially ""going down"" right?  Now my other question: Are there objects in every single direction is space? How about in the Bootes void? Since it's such a massive void and there isn't much objects around to pull you in ""down"" or go away from ""up"", essentially can't we go in any direction?   If it may seems that my question about this is kind of confusing, I apologize because I'm confused about this myself!  "

1125,Are brown dwarfs which dont sustain any fusion considered stars?,"I was reading about the coolest stars , and surprised to find about stars with a surface temperature lower than a candle, like 2MASS 0939-2448 A/B, of about 100 celsius like CFBDSIR 1458+10B and even behind 0 celius temperature where the water freezes like WISE J0855-0714. Then I thought, they might be stars where fusion only happens very deep in the core, and then I found out this,  Brown dwarf     In addition, many brown dwarfs undergo no fusion; those at the low end   of the mass range (under 13 MJ) are never hot enough to fuse even   deuterium, and even those at the high end of the mass range (over 60   MJ) cool quickly enough that after 10 million years they no longer   undergo fusion.   Are these brown dwarfs which dont sustain any type of fusion considered stars? If so, what's the reason? "
1126,Stellar mass limits for Neutron Star and Black Holes,"Don't hate on me if I am asking a very basic and straightforward thing. I have a few questions about black holes and neutron stars.   What is the mass range (in terms of solar masses) for a main sequence star to end its life as . . .   A) a neutron star? B) a black hole?  Is it there a (practically observed or proven) possible method for a main sequence star to form a neutron star (or black hole) at the end of its life cycle without undergoing through the process of supernova?  If yes, please explain or guide me some article on this matter. What is the mass range of a main sequence star to end up as a pair instability supernova?  If the range of pair instability supernova overlaps with that of neutron star or black hole forming supernovae, how do we determine what type of end a star would have?  "
1127,How much competition there is for jobs in astronomy compared to other fields of science?,"I will soon finish a master's degree in computer science. I have been interested in astronomy for some time, which has included playing around with a Newtonian reflector telescope and reading about CCD-cameras.  I checked some local universities, and was amazed that they have only 10 or so graduates each year (1-2 get a PhD and the rest a master's degree). How many jobs are there for these graduates? Compared to other fields, how tough is the competition in astronomy? Is it different for some relatively new areas, e.g. space neuroscience or astrobiology?  I am considering to apply for an astronomy PhD, so any input would be helpful. "
1128,Where might a semi proficient amateur analyst participate in meaningful astronomical efforts,"I am a retired engineer that has an ongoing interest in space efforts.  In my youth I did work on the Apollo program but on propulsion and vehicle thermal control: not flight dynamics.  I have reviewed/studied some astrodynamics (Vallado, Bates, etc) and can run GMAT and tudat libraries from Delft University.  I have explored Systemic Console, tap, and other software for implying the existence of exoplanets from RV curves and light transit curves.  I can download data in FITS format from various astronomical databases.  Where might I direct my efforts in some meaningful way by participating in a project, collaborating with an investigator, or pursuing some research oriented endeavour on my own?   Could someone point me in a direction where I might do some meaningful work?  Just picking a star and starting a transit analysis does not seem to have any probability of leading anywhere.   Those sites where one views a light transit curve or tries to classify a galaxy type are not very interesting to me.  I feel I could investigate things more in depth than that.  Directions, Ideas, offers! Anyone. I will post this in Space Exploration forum also. Thanks,  Tom Kosvic "
1129,Occurrence of Venusian transits,"As transits of Venus come in pairs, each separated by 8 years, wouldn't that imply an accurate ratio between Earth's and Venus' revolution period? I've found the ratio to be about 0.681. I presume one could see a resonance of 2/3 in that number, but as other resonances in our solar system as for example Thethys and Enceladus (4:3) are far more accurate, could it be ""just"" coincidental? And if so, why the regularity in the transits?  "
1130,Why do meteorites explode?,"Some meteorites just blaze away, streaking through the sky. This is clearly explained, as they either slow down enough for the flame to cease, or ablate in their entirety, turning to vapor.  But some, like the Chelyabinsk meteorite, explode violently.  What effect is responsible for this?  Can it be that with their irregular surface acting as a turbine they enter a spin of increasing speed, and once the centrifugal force reaches a certain level, it causes the meteorite to break apart rapidly, hurling parts of it in all directions at speeds far exceeding its speed so far? "
1131,How are cardinal points on horizon defined?,"How are the cardinal points (North-East-South-West) defined? On equatorial regions it is somewhat obvious. But what about the higher latitudes?

1132,Are larger stars rounder?,"The Earth is a very smooth sphere, and the Sun even more so, with only minor fluctuations. I am wondering: are larger stars even rounder? Intuitively, that seems self evident, but I am not so sure. For instance, the hydrostatic equilibrium causes larger stars to be much less dense than red dwarfs. So what is the most important factor for how round a star is, a higher mass, or less activity? The most prominent cause of irregularities is of course the rotation rate of the star, which is pretty much independent of size. Ignoring that, do larger stars have smaller a deviations from the ellipsoid relative to their size?  Edit  As it seems like the ""other than rotation rate"" criterion is not really meaningfull, I now terminate it. "
1133,Planning to revisit Arthur Eddington's experiment from 1919,"As the fateful day draws closer, the United States will host a celestial event that comes once in three generations. I plan to witness this first hand at the exact center of greatest eclipse.  In the planning of this, I have immersed myself in the work of Eddington back in 1919, confirming Einstein’s General Theory of Relativity (and its explanations for gravity) was right.  I personally, could not just stand-by and just look at this event and not do something more. Knowing that failure, due to weather, equipment, and or other forces are stacked against me, I have to make an attempt because a chance like this will never present itself again in my lifetime.  My goal in coming here today is simple, I need some advice from someone who knows telescopes and cameras.  The equipment I plan on using is :   a 150 mm Celestron 6SE with an automatic GOTO mount, and an equatorial wedge.  The camera will be a Sony A 6000, with an adapter.   TThe field of view is large because of the 1500 mm focal of the telescope. I chose device because of a trade-off that has to be made, Eddington used a 100 mm refractor scope when conducting his experiment. With any shift in the apparent position of the stars behind the sun as Einstein predicted, the 150 mm telescope should, in theory, coupled with a camera that has a 24-megapixel sensor, have the necessary resolution to image this shift like Eddington's image. If any shift to the stars is to be captured, they will appear within close proximity surrounding the eclipse.  My problem is as follows, the telescope I will be using, will be the lens, and now the lens has only one f-stop. At f/10 and only having the ISO and shutter speed to work with, what exposure would I use ?  Knowing that a long exposure would only manage to capture the outer corona, and possibly engulfing and obscuring any stars that shift. Likewise, a shorter exposure would capture the inner corona and thus not image any stars at all.  I do however plan to bracket 5 stops (shutter speeds) to better my odd of catching any shift.  Would anyone have any other useful tips trick to further better my odds in my endeavor?   Thanks In advance  Bob Brooks  "
1134,Magnification of a telescope,"  I took an image of Jupiter through my 8"" Dobsonian Telescope, attaching a DSLR and a 1.25"" Barlow Lens where the eyepiece goes, as shown in this video: [website]Through numerous online sources, I learnt that to find the angle of view of my image, the magnification of my image needed to be calculated, and that this value along with the given field view for my eyepiece.  [website]The above website answers the following question, the calculations of which I attempted to mimic.     My first telescope was a Meade 6600 -- they don't make it any more -- it's a 6-inch f/5 Newtonian scope. It came with a 25mm eyepiece. So... what was the magnification I was getting with this scope?   Here are the calculations I did in hopes of getting the above result:  [tex]  [tex]  [tex]  [tex]  As shown in the video (the first link above), I didn't use an eyepiece to take my picture - I used a barlow lens, a couple of adapters, and a DSLR. So at this point, I am not sure what value to use for the ""focal length of the eyepiece."" How can I proceed to calculate the magnification? "
1135,Velocity of most distant galaxies,"Taking Hubble's law into account, what is the velocity of the most distant galaxies relative to Earth? Yes, I know that it is actually space that is expanding, (so, it is not their real velocity), but at what speed relative to Earth are they receding from us? "
1136,Is there a reason why the IAU differenciates objects in the SS orbiting the sun into a particular classification but it doesnt for satellites?,"The IAU has different classifications for objects in the solar system orbiting the sun, they can be according to their shape and if they clear their neighborhood of other material around its orbits , planets, dwarf planets or Small Solar System bodies. But for objects in the solar system orbiting a planet or a dwarf planet they are all satellites, no matter if they are rounded or if they have an irregular shape like an asteroid. Is there any known reason why this is so? Why is it needed to differenciate its shape when the object it's orbiting the sun, but it isnt needed when the object it's orbiting a planet? (or dwarf planet)? "
1137,"Standardized ""constellation"" regions?","The current system of constellations is historical and has kind of arbitrary boundaries.

Do any of these systems (if they exist) attempt to preserve the most important/famous constellations (as least the part people normally see) ? "
1138,How do I see more than just points in the sky?,"I just bought a new telescope with these specifications:   Aperture: 203 mm Focal Length: 1200 mm F/ratio: f/5.9   I usually use a 28 mm eyepiece, giving me about 42.5x magnification, but I also have a 20 mm and a 10 mm eyepiece.   I was trying to find Messier objects, but I only found the Orion Nebula, and even then it wasn't very impressive. I was wondering, what types of objects are see-able in my telescope? I read that Charles Messier found the Messier objects using a four-inch refractor, and I have an 8 inch reflecting telescope.   When I tried to find things like the pinwheel galaxy, or the crab nebula, I only saw points of light. So basically, how do I see things like nebula and galaxies?

1140,What supernova has created the iron currently found in Earth core?,"Iron is generated by stars in a certain part of their life cycle. Earth contains a lot of iron inside, however it is clear that this iron could have not been generated in a star in close proximity. If we consider the current Earth position as reference, where would have lied 4.5 billions years ago the stars that generated the iron currently found in Earth core? Can we say that in the current Earth position there was a huge star 4.5 billions years ago? How did the iron formed in these old stars reach the primordial gas cloud that turned into the solar system? For how long did it travel? Can we say that it came from a set of stars that lived (again, 4.5 billions years ago) in the area that we now call the galaxy core, for example? Can we define the set of ""iron generating"" areas? Can we define something like the ""Earth core iron generator sphere""? "
1141,Does the KBO 2014-MU69 have two numbers and entries in asteroid databases? How did it get promoted to Major Body designation?,"In this answer I show that the (now pretty famous) Kuiper Belt Object 2014-MU69 has two entries in JPL's ephemeris generating Horizons site; Major Body 3713011 and Small Body 486958. I'm pretty sure these represent the same body, their trajectories differ by about a half-million kilometers only, and that difference is probably only because for one of them the trajectory is only based on a 118 day arc of it's ~100,000 day orbit at ~43 AU back in 2015.  Are both 3713011 and 486958 still official references to the same body, but in different catalogs or databases? Is there a disambiguation page linking the two numbers somewhere? How did 2014-MU69 (unofficially Ultima Thule) get promoted from SB to MB?       "
1142,Mass of quantum fluctuations in space?,"I have no formal training in physics, just a casual interest, so if this question doesn't make sense i would love to understand why.  I know from casual physics talks etc that pairs of particles pop in and out of existence due to fluctuations in the underlying relevant field.  Does that mean that for every instant there is an extra amount of mass per unit of space equal to the massive 'fluctuation' particles that still did not pop out of existence/annihilate?  If that holds true has anyone measured it or calculated it? "
1143,Is there a timekeeping word for the orbit of a moon?,"For a planet, we can colloquially refer to its period of rotation as a ""day"" and its period of revolution around its parent star as a ""year."" Some worlds have unique terms, such as Martian days being referred to as ""sols"", but the principle is the same: one word for rotation around its axis, another for revolutions around the star.  Is there an equivalent word for the period of a moon's revolution around a planet? On Earth it roughly lines up with a ""month,"" but multi-moon planets would have different periods for each moon.   If I was in charge of timekeeping for a mission to Europa or Ganymede, what term would I use to refer to the period of time it takes for the moon to complete one orbit of Jupiter? "

I also understand the further an obect in a telescope is the further into the past I am looking.    So given that we are finding exoplantets with methods that go well beyond any practical visual range are we fnding these exoplanets 'in their past' as well? As far as I understand radio telescopes and other methods can't travel faster than light therfore their results are also from past events, is my reasoning in this right? "

What are good ways to safely view the eclipse?    I don't want to make a big trip out of it, only to be looking into a poor quality pin-hole shoebox, or $2 mirrored cardboard glasses.  How can get I get a good, detailed clear view of it while staying safe?  What about ways to photograph it effectively? "
1147,How close would the orbit of Mars have to be to that of the Earth to induce a collision?,"When the Earth passes by Mars they exert a slight gravitational pull on each other, but the force is so small that their orbits are not significantly disturbed.  However, if we imagined that the orbits of the Earth and Mars were coplanar and much closer to one another, then there would presumably be some critical distance at which they would move together and collide.  What is that critical distance? In other words, if we shrunk the radius of the orbit of Mars, how much would it have to shrink before a collision would occur by the natural force of gravity between the two bodies? "

1149,Is radiation from neutron stars delayed by time dilation?,"I understand a neutron star to be the densest stuff that can exist without becoming a black hole, the densest thing which directly gives off radiation we can detect. At the event horizon of a black hole, time stands still, in our frame of reference.  Does there exist neutron stars which are very close to getting an event horizon?  Does this ""neutron star horizon"" cause time dilation, a zone from within of which movement is very slow in our frame of reference?  Could it for example be that the first light from a neutron star itself reaches us billions of years after the light of the supernova of the ""classical"" star which created the neutron star and its event-horizon like relativistic effects? "
1150,Daylight Time Expansion,"I live in northern hemisphere around 44th latitude. Starting from Winter Solstice, December 21, 2018 the duration of daylight is naturally increasing. What I observe, however, is that the duration increase is happening more in the evening rather than in the morning. In other words as days pass, the sunset seems to move forward much faster to a later hour than the first morning light moving backward to an earlier hour.  Is what I am observing a true phenomenon or is it merely a wrong observation? If so why is this happening in an uneven fashion?  EDIT    I found the sunrise/sunset times for my area. It in fact confirms the situation. In the first half of January sunrise moved back only 3 minutes while sunset moved forward 15 minutes with respect to civil time. "
1151,How do I see Deep Sky Objects in my telescope?,"I just bought a new telescope. I tried it out, and I even woke up at 3am when the moon set so there was light pollution. I have an 8 inch dobsonian telescope with a focal length of 1200 mm. For some reason, I only see points of light in the sky, except for the moon and Jupiter and the Orion Nebula.   My goal is to complete a messier marathon, but first I need to be able to see the Messier objects. So my question is, what is the best way to look for Deep Sky Objects with my telescope? And how much does light pollution get in the way of looking for them? For reference, I live in the northern United States. "

1154,From where does the energy for gravitational waves come from?,"As far as I understand, in the events detected by LIGO, about 4% of the total mass of merging binary black holes was converted to gravitational waves.   Where does this energy come from, i.e. what exactly gets converted into gravitational waves?   Is it simply the kinetic energy of the merging objects (velocities of these objects before merger are huge, up to 60% of c if I recall correctly), so does it mean emitting gravitational waves makes them orbit slower, but retain their original masses? Or do the compact objects really lose ""real"" mass, meaning they become lighter and in case of BHs their radius changes accordingly?   As an example, let's assume two BHs, both with 50 solar masses, orbiting each other far enough (say 1 light year) so that GWs nor kinetic energy has no significance to these initial mass measurements. During the merge, they should radiate about 5 solar masses in GWs. Would the resulting black hole have mass of 95 or 100 solar masses? "

1156,What would the night sky look like if the Milky Way were the only galaxy in the universe?,I'm curious to know what the sky would look like without any other galaxies out there. How much do other galaxies factor into the stars we see? Does the Milky Way account for most of them? Would the night sky look normal? Or would it be very empty? 
1157,How to find period of a pulsar from a given time sampled voltage data?,"I've a data file with 2 columns, each containing time sampled voltage output (a sequence of real numbers) from a radio telescope, so there is a pair of telescope which are measuring the signal here. The source of the data is a pulsar and I've to find its period and dispersion measure.  I'm an amateur trying to understand what is really happening in the method. The data is time sampled at the Nyquist sampling frequency (2B) and the signal is measured at central frequency f and broadband B.  I studied the cross correlation between the two voltages V1 and V2 from essential radio astronomy, but didn't quite understand the method. Do we have to evaluate the cross correlation function of each reading and then plot it with time to get the pulse profile? Or do we have to take fourier transform of each pair of voltage(how?) and then plot it to get the pulse profile? We find period of a pulsar from its average pulse profile, right?  It is also written that to find pulsar timing, we've to fold data from many pulses modulo instantaneous pulse period (how can we do that if we don't know the pulse period in the first place?). This sentence is everywhere and I'm not able to understand it each time.  I'm confused about the appropriate series of steps to be done here to get the pulsar period and dispersion measure. Could you give me some insight?  Thanks. "
1158,Longest and shortest wavelength,What is the longest and what is the shortest wavelength of light? How fast would a light-emitting object have to recede in order to shift the frequency of light to increase the wavelength from the shortest to the longest? (If there are limits) 
1159,Question regarding the Milky Way when calculating galactic space velocities for galaxies,"I have been calculating galaxy space velocities (where proper motions are known) in order to measure their orbits of the Milky Way using the method proposed in the appendix of [website]The question I have is: Do we put the Milky Way through the same calculation process to get an initial velocity, or do we have that it's (0,0,0) as it is essentially our origin point (ie the U velocity component would mean that the Milky Way is moving in the direction away from its own galactic centre which doesn't really make sense to me as this could be any direction)?   I have put it through the process and found an initial space velocity of the Milky Way of (-11.1,232.24,7.25) (my method differs slightly from the link since I have used an updated velocity vector for the motion of the sun with respect to the Local standard of Rest) which essentially just comes from correction solar and galaxy rotation motions.  So, is this calculated vector correct for the Milky Way or should it be (0,0,0)?  Thanks  "
1160,Why isn't our local interstellar space colorised?,"Looking at answers to this question, people seem pretty convinced that human naked eye should be able to see the colour of ionised gas/dust cloud when they are inside an emission nebula.  And we know Solar system is surrounded by Interplanetary dust cloud, and possibly inside an Interstellar cloud. Why don't we see a colorised space backdrop?  Does it have to do with density of gas cloud? or how ionised they are? Does camera with long exposure see some background colour our naked eye can't?  (Excuse me for any wrong terminology.) "
1161,Why does the Chandrasekhar limit affect white dwarfs differently?,"The Chandrasekhar limit is the maximum mass of a stable white dwarf star. Beyond this, a carbon-oxygen white dwarf will typically explode in a type 1a supernova, due to the nuclear reactions at those temperatures.  I've heard that oxygen-neon-magnesium white dwarfs, on the other hand, will not ignite. Rather, electron capture becomes energetically favorable and they become neutron stars. If I understand correctly, this also happens for carbon-oxygen white dwarfs in binaries, if the white dwarf has most of the mass in the system.  Why is this? Can anyone walk me through, step by step, what happens if a white dwarf (of both compositions) exceeds the Chandrasekhar limit, and how each differs?    Source: [website]"
1162,How can we tell the difference between matter and antimatter by observation in space?,"I just was wondering and searching on the internet with little luck in the topic. On Antimatter Wiki they tell the observable universe is built up by matter. I read antimatter can be detected in cosmic rays in very small quantity. But let's go in theories and our practical knowledge, my question is:  How could we detect if a set of objects (like an entire galaxy) is completely built up by antimatter? Since matter and antimatter look like ""mirror image"" on current, could they form a similar object which is indistinguishable from ""our"" matter objects? I mean, would spectrum analysis for example show that it is not matter, but built up by antimatter?  Linked question: Are we sure about that what we see in universe is matter? "
1163,Binary Star question,"Is it POSSIBLE that we are a binary system? I have been doing research into this topic and it seems we may infact be a binary system. If we are, what effects would a massive body comming into our system be? And are these effects happening now? "
1164,Do other stars have Oort clouds?,"Stars have in the past passed within 1 light year from the Sun, and will do so in the future too. If they have Oort clouds, would there not be interactions between their Oort cloud objects and the planets of the Solar system? For example, the outer edge of the Sun's Oort cloud is approximately 100,000 AU away. So, if another star comes at a distance of 1 light year from the Sun, its Oort cloud should similarly go through the inner solar system. Does this actually happen? "
1165,Milky Way stellar number density : is the stated equation in this paper incorrect?,"The paper is : [website]The equation is equation #23 in the paper. It's a model for the density of stars in the Milky Way's disk. It has an exponential dependence on both [tex] and [tex]. [tex] is the distance from the center of the galaxy, and [tex] is the distance above/below the plane of the disk.  The relation is roughly this:  [tex]  The problem I'm seeing is the [tex]-dependence of the formula. [tex] and [tex] here are standard cylindrical coordinates. Thus, [tex] can be positive or negative. The problem is that the formula blows up when [tex] is negative. This is unphysical, since the number density must generally decrease going further away from the disk.  Am I missing something? Or should the equation really have an absolute magnitude of [tex]?  [Added Later:] I finished making a 3D demo of the stellar number density of the Milky Way. Note that your browser needs to support WebGL. "
1166,Cosmological redshift and comparing past galaxy sizes,"If you were to divide the present-day universe into cubes with sides 10 million light-years long, each cube would contain, on average, about one galaxy similar in size to the Milky Way. Now suppose you travel back in time, to an era when the average distance between galaxies is one quarter of its current value, corresponding to a cosmological redshift of z = 3. How many galaxies similar in size to the Milky Way would you expect to find, on average, in cubes of that same size? In order to simplify the problem, assume that the total number of galaxies of each type has not changed between then and now. Based on your answer, would you expect collisions to be much more frequent at that time or only moderately more frequent?  I am very confused with this question. From my intuition, I take that volume would equal to distance^3. They have given us that the past distance would be 1/4 of current. Therefore, do I cube 1/4distance? Also how does the redshift of 3 play a part in the solution. Thanks for any help! I do not need an answer, just how to start. "
1167,Does the new moon appear at the same time around the world or in one region last,"My query is basically, say for example if the new moon is seen in the Middle east region, does it mean that it was the day of new moon in sub continental country as well ? You can't have a new moon in India for example the next day scientifically, right ? Please help me understand this with diagrams so I can explain it to others.   To me it doesn't make sense that we will have two consecutive new moons in the same region of the planet. New moon in middle east but new moon in India is on the next day.  I am aware since it's a broad topic so timezone can change the answer so in this question. I am restricting my question to the sighting of the new moon in the same region as in say Moon is sighted in Dubai, doesn't it make sense that India will also have the first day of moon on the same day given that it all falls in the same plane.

I'm not sure i understand the maths of three-dimensional tori, but I want to ask:  Does this model posit that the shape of the universe is that of a ring doughnut? If so, is the universe contained inside the ring doughnut, or is it supposed to exist only on the surface?  Or does the model say that the universe has the shape of a higher dimensional version of a ring doughnut? If so, does it exist inside the higher dimensional ring doughnut, or on its surface? "
1169,Beta Andromedae (Mirach) and distances mentioned in original Cosmos series from 1980,"In one of the episodes from Carl Sagan's show Cosmos he explains that Beta Andromedae is the second brightest star in the constellation Andromeda, and is 75 light years away. The link to the video is here.  I've looked up this star on Wikipedia and it says it's the brightest star in the constellation, not the second brightest, and instead of 75 light years away it says it's about 197 light years away.   I know that this show Cosmos is quite old. It aired in 1980. I understand our measurements are more accurate nowadays, but I was just wondering if anyone knew why the discrepancy with the brightest and second brightest star claims, and also that the Wikipedia article says it's 197 light years away, a difference of about 260% from the 75 light years mentioned by Sagan. That's quite a significant difference.   His information of the distance from us to the center of our galaxy is quite close: he says 30 thousand light years; Wikipedia says 27 thousand light years. As to our distance to Andromeda, he says: 2 million light years; Wikipedia says 2.5 million light years.   Have I completely got the wrong star that I'm looking up? "
1170,Probability of finding life-supporting exoplanets,"We've found over a thousand exoplanets by now, but how many of them could support life? What percentage of newly found planets are potentially life-harbouring? Or haven't we found any exoplanets that meet these criteria yet? "
1171,Are the stars seen at the equator different throughout the year?,"If you live on the equator and look up at the night's sky at, say, midnight, would you see a completely different sky on the 1st of January than you would on the 1st of July?  I assume you would as the night side would be facing away from the sun by 180 degrees and necessarily looking outward from the solar system 180 degrees from each of the two points at those times.  Is that correct? Why? "
1172,Simple Question about Constellation,"I am currently self teaching myself some basic astronomy. My book claims, if a constellation is observed for exactly 6 months during a year, then it lies on the celestial equator. I have failed to understand why this must be true. Shouldn't the visible duration depends on the position of the observer? For example, for an observer at equator, wouldn't all constellations (accept those at the polaris) be visible for exactly half a year? Also, is the constellation at the NCP always visible for people in the northern hemisphere? Thank you in advance! "
1173,Timeline of falling into a blackhole,"For some ""average sized"" black hole, how long would it take for a distant (spacesuit-wearing!) astronaut to:   be able to see the gravitational lensing with the naked eye  clearly feel the gravity gradient reach a lethal gravity gradient cross the event horizon   Ultimately I'm interested in the subjective experience of a human falling into a black hole. Would it be drawn out and unpleasant? Or is it that by the time the gradient would be painful, there'd be barely any time at all before annihilation? "
1174,Types of Exoplanets,"We discover vastly more exoplanets that are gas giants that orbit their parent star very closely, than small terrestrial planets that are more distant to their sun. Could this be due to the methods we use to find exoplanets?  Gas giants have stronger gravity which makes their star oscillate more. Moreover they are larger which eclipses more of the light of the star during transits?  Are big hot Jupiters far easier to detect than small rocky worlds? "
1175,Were there any images of a transitary event of Jupiter or Saturn as imaged by a deep probe mission,"I'm quite certain that there isn't any actual images of a transitory event of Jupiter or Saturn across the solar disk from say e.g.,s the Voyager probe, Pioneer 10/11 or even recent New Horizons mission?   Another related question I have, what would the approximate transit of Jupiter look like as seen from Saturn. The distance between Saturn and Jupiter is approximately 4-5AU, and the diameter of Jupiter is one tenth that of the Sun's. Are we looking at perhaps a transit which covers 10-15% of the solar disk?  N.B. Please note I understand that to observe a transit of Jupiter we have to be superior to it in the Solar System, hence I am asking for images taken by deep Solar System probes only.  "
1176,How close to circular is the Earth's equator,"Earth's orbit is about 99% circular. How circular is Earth around the equator? I know it bulges around the equator and is a spheroid. I also know it is not smooth and has oceans and mountains and all that.   Is there a similar measure of eccentricity to describe how circular it is around the equator?   Is it stretched into an ellipse by the sun/moon, and if so by how much?  Just for comparison, does the Earth's equator deviate from a circle more than the Earths' orbit around the Sun deviates from a circle? "
1177,For how many bodies can there be a stable orbit with no very heavy central body?,"The question is a bit vague, but let me explain:      Take for example 2 bodies of the same mass. They can orbit around their centre of mass/gravity. Is something like this possible with multiple bodies of varying mass and distance from the centre of gravity without a relatively extremely massive body there? i.e. would it be possible to have a planetary system that orbited around the centre of mass without there being a massive star (roughly) in the middle?  I know that the Sun also has an orbit around the centre of gravity of the solar system, but that orbit is very small compared to its size, which puts it roughly in the centre. "
1178,Scientifically important discoveries with the help of amateurs,"I am looking for examples where amateur astronomers in these days contributed sigificantly to important scientifically discoveries.  I am aware of one example: Victor Buso from Argentina was lucky enough to observe a Supernova just when it formed, which has led to follow-up observations by large scientific observatories, and in the end resulted in a Nature article which has Buso as a co-author.   What might some other similar examples be?    below: ""Astronomer Victor Buso poses in front of the telescope with which he witnessed the birth of the supernova 2016gkg.

1179,Sunsets: Mars/Earth,"I understand why our sky is blue and turns red when the sun sets or rises. I know why the sky on mars is red, but why does it turn blue during sunsets and rises? Shouldn't this actually not work due to the shorter wavelenght blue has compared to red? "
1180,Tides with 3 Largish Moons,"As part of my worldbuilding for a book, I’d like to have a planet with extreme variance in its tides. I want lowest tide  reveal about 30 miles of floodplain, and occasional massive tidal waves. I understand that, in theory, this might be achieved by giving the planet several relatively large moons with different orbital periods, such that sometimes they are spaced out so they balance out the tides (a kind of medium tide), and sometimes they are all together on one side of the planet so that they create a highest / lowest tide.  How stable can such a system be? (The star and other solar system features can be whatever to improve stability, if that is a thing)  Any spitballed numbers for viable orbital periods and tidal patterns? "
1181,How is the age of a star on the Henyey track calculated?,"I was reading Stellar Evolution in Early Phases of Gravitational Contraction, by Chushiro Henyey, where he writes,     If [tex] along the path, the age of a star from the time when [tex] is given by   [tex]   where [tex] and [tex] are the present values.   This seems to be just for stars on the Hayashi track (and treated here just for Population 1 stars).

1184,Rendering asteroid orientation as seen from Earth,"I am writing a program to render an asteroid as seen from various parts of the solar system.  My goal is to roughly reproduce the image of Cacus according to information on its DAMIT detail page.    Here is my approach:   Create a solar system at JD0=2443568.0.  The axes of the visualization are arranged according to the ecliptic with positive X axis in the direction of the vernal equinox and other axes according to the right-hand rule.  Earth is positioned at t=JD0.  (image) Place the asteroid at (0, 0, 0) and begin to rotate the object according to the matrix multiplication described by the Description page and Kaasalainen &amp; Torppa 2001:   φ0=0 and t=JD0, so there is no initial Z axis rotation Latitude β is -63, so rotate 90 - (-63) = 153 degrees on the Y axis (image) Longitude λ is 251, so rotate the object 251 degrees anticlockwise around the Z axis of the ecliptic (image)  Using ephemeris from the NASA/JPL Small Body Database, move Cacus to its position in orbit at JD0. (image) Move the camera to Earth's position at JD0 and point it at the asteroid. (image)   My final rendering does not match the projection from DAMIT.  I understand that there are factors like light-time correction that I'm not including, but it looks completely different.    What is wrong with my approach to rotating the asteroid on its spin axis?    (The work-in-progress visualization is online here) "

1186,How do ASKAP's focal plane phased array feeds interact with the entire array phasing?,"Sky &amp; Telescope's ASKAP Joins the Hunt for Mysterious Bursts says:     A new telescope, the Australian Square Kilometre Array Pathfinder (ASKAP), has joined the search for energetic and elusive fast radio bursts. And in just a few days of looking, it’s already had success!   Later on, the article goes into some detail about ASKAP:     A new player is now on the scene, however, and it’s already had huge success. ASKAP is a wide-field radio telescope made up of an array of 12-meter antennas. Using phased-array-feed technology, ASKAP is able to instantaneously observe an effective area of 160 square degrees — an enormous field compared to Parkes’ 0.6 square degrees! This capability significantly increases our chances of being able to detect fast radio bursts.   The article links to The Detection of an Extremely Bright Fast Radio Burst in a Phased Array Feed Survey which is not paywalled and contains some discussion of the array.  This sounds really interesting! It is a phased array of dishes, but at the focal plane of each dish there is also a phased array of receivers.  This is different than just adding an array of feed horns and independent receivers as I've discussed in my surprisingly robustly unanswered question What is the highest granularity focal-plane array on a dish radio telescope? Or is this the ONLY ONE? where receivers measure intensity as pixels, in a similar way to a camera (thus the counterintuitively placed astrophotography tag there).  Here, each focal plane is equipped with a true phased array, where if I understand correctly, phase relationships between elements in the focal plane are maintained and recorded.   According to Wikipedia and CSIRO's Australian Square Kilometre Array Pathfinder – Fast Facts there are 36 separate 12-meter dishes in the entire array, and the focal plane of each dish is equipped with a 188 element focal-plane phased-array. 188 [tex] 36 = 6768 channels, not counting polarizations because I don't know if they are separate channels in this case.  That would require quite a hefty correlater if the analysis was done flat, without any heierarchy in the calculation. This is a pathfinder for the SKA so pushing limits is important, but I'd like to know how this large number of signals is handled. Is there pre-processing?    Question: How do the phased array feeds on each dish of the ASKAP interact with the entire array phasing?  I'm not sure of the ""focal plane array"" is located precisely at the focal plane or not. If it were, then a given source in the sky would produce signals in only one, or a small group of receivers, and not the whole focal plane array! One normally uses a phased array instead of an imaging system so there must be something more interesting going on here, perhaps only nearest and next-nearest neighbor correlations within the focal plane array but full correlation between the dishes?  How does this thing really work?    below x2: Cropped from CSIRO ScienceImage 2161 Close up of a radio astronomy telescope with several more in the background.     "

1189,When was the nearest star discovered?,"When historically did we realize that the Sun is a star, like all the others?  An answer was posted, then the question was put on hold. I would like to answer: If indeed someone asserted that the Sun was a star 2500 years ago, that is rather humbling. That it took until about 100 years ago for it to be proven is even more humbling!  People level a lot of claims against science and scientists. But if a field of knowledge takes over 100 generations to prove a true statement, perhaps they have a right to criticize. So, I think that science needs to do a better job of proving its theories. Either that, or people need to have more common sense, not to recognize something that has been staring billions of people in the face for all time. Perhaps, we should all be a bit more humble about the state of knowledge, even in obvious areas?  Maybe if we had taken the people who proposed this fact, and the concept of atoms, seriously at the time, we would be on our way to other stars by now instead of still having only visited that big white thing nearby (forgot the name just now) and that not for the past 40 years.

1190,Would dark energy save the earth for a while as the sun heats up?,"Would the expansion of space (e.g. dark energy) move the earth further away from the sun over time, possibly saving us for perhaps a few billion years as the sun heats up?  Scientists now tend to think that the sun is heating up very gradually (e.g. over billions of years): [website]Dark energy is the unexplained accelerating expansion of the universe, as described here: [website]Put another way, my question is, is dark energy working at such a rate that it would move earth (and other planets) further from the sun and prolong life on earth as the sun heats up?

1191,Luminosity value to use for the calculation of the habitable zone?,"I'm currently studying the star system of Gliese 570  and I´m trying to calculate the habitable zone of the component A from the luminosity value in relation of the Sun´s. I´ve read that the needed value of luminosity is the value of the bolometric luminosity (here 26%), but the calculations of the HZ that I found is about 0.40 AU, which seems to be calculated from the visual luminosity (about 16%).   So, the questions are: Which of these 2 values do I have to use to calculate the habitable zone? Does the stellar class of the star affect the selection of it? "
1192,How old are Janus and Epimetheus?,"How old are Janus and Epimetheus, and are they believed to have formed out of a collision? (I think would explain their shared orbit).    Not the age of their elements, which should be similar to the age of the solar system, but the age of their surface and formation.  Cassini told us that Saturn's rings formed relatively recently, 100 or 200 million years ago.  Are there similar aging techniques that can be applied to the surface of icy moons and as that been done?   (related, this type of aging technique should apply to Pluto and Charon too, because they are believed to have formed by collision).  Edit:  I came across this which says:     The extensive cratering indicates that Epimetheus must be quite old.   Janus and Epimetheus may have formed from a disruption of a single   parent to form co-orbital satellites, but if this is the case the   disruption must have happened early in the history of the satellite   system. From its very low density and relatively high albedo, it seems   likely that Epimetheus is a very porous icy body.[4] There is a lot of   uncertainty in these values, however, and so this remains to be   confirmed.   So, significant uncertainty but probably quite old, early in the history of the satellite system, which would be fairly early in solar-system formation.  Much older than Saturn's rings.  I'll leave this question open in case anyone has better info, the above being from Wikipedia, though they reference a NASA article. "

1194,How to deal with shifting CCD bias (zero exposure) levels?,"The median values of the bias frames coming from our teaching telescope shift up or down with each capture. For example:  import glob, numpy as np, astropy.io.fits as fio, matplotlib.pyplot as plt  data = np.zeros((10,255,765), dtype=np.int) for i, f in enumerate(glob.glob('bias_*.fit')):     data[i,:,:] = fio.getdata(f)  print(np.median(data, axis=(1,2)))   [ 106.  106.  108.  108.  110.  108.  105.  106.  107.  107.]  Now, during data reduction we average combine our bias frames. We also reject outliers (either minmax or sigmaclip). But if some of our frames are ""shifted"" higher than others, wouldn't this skew the averaging (and especially the outlier rejection) so that we might be introducing more noise during averaging?  To give you an idea of the nature of this fluctuation, I did a quick analysis: read 10 bias frames, then iterated through them, subtracting each frame from the median combination of all other frames. This gives me something like ""noise frames"", showing only how much each frame deviates from the median of the rest. Below is the code and the distributions of two of these noise frames.  noiseframes = np.zeros((10,255,765), dtype=np.int) otherframes = np.ones(10, dtype=np.bool) # just a mask for i in xrange(10):     otherframes[:] = True     otherframes[i] = False # exclude current frame from mask     median_of_others = np.median(data[otherframes,:,:], axis=0)     noiseframes[i,:,:] = data[i,:,:] - median_of_others  def plotdist(i):     frame = noiseframes[i].flatten()     x = np.arange(np.min(frame),np.max(frame)+1)     y = np.bincount(frame-np.min(frame))     plt.step(x, y, label=str(np.median(data[i,:,:])))  plotdist(4) plotdist(3) plt.xlabel('Difference from median [ADU]') plt.legend() plt.show()     All of the noise frames have near-perfect gaussian distributions with pretty much constant FWHM, it's just the central value that shifts around with each frame.  This leads me to a couple of conclusions: firstly, this shift truely is a shift in median value and not just a result of something like cosmic rays; secondly, the fluctuation is an additive effect and so not due to a change in gain due to a difference in voltage or something like that.  I also could not find any correlation with temperature or time since last readout, both of which I suspected for a moment.  Perhaps it's slight changes in readout time?  I couldn't find any mention of this kind of artefact in my own course notes. It's also not mentioned anywhere online that I can find.  Can any of you help me to a) identify the possible sources of such a fluctuation and/or b) provide a proven strategy for dealing with this during data reduction? "

1198,How stable are Lissajous orbits?,"Now that the Gaia Space Telescope is on it's way to the Sun-Earth L2 Lagrangian point (SEL2), I start wondering about the stability of Gaia's orbit there. The Planck Telescope is already there, as was Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP) and other probes, and from Wikipedia I learned that:     In practice, any orbit around Lagrangian points L1, L2, or L3 is   dynamically unstable, meaning small departures from equilibrium grow   exponentially over time.   Gaia has some kind of Orbital Maneuvering System (to borrow a Space Shuttle term) and some propellant on board, so has Planck, however I wonder how deterministic these orbits are and if both Planck and Gaia have automatic corrections and collision detection in their flight computers; L2 is ""only"" 1.5 million km (or about 5 light-seconds) away so surely there's time for manual correction.  Does anyone know a source which tells how different Gaia's and Planck's orbits are, if there are intersections between their orbital planes or even how likely the need for an unplanned orbital correction is? I know Lissajou-shapes from maths classes and I know how much the projected trail can differ depending on the precision of data types used in calculations (e.g. float vs. double). How does ESA/NASA handle this, now that SEL2 seems it will become a crowded place? "
1199,How do I create a galaxy stellar mass function?,"Suppose that I have an array of stellar masses of tens of thousands of galaxies, and that I also already know what the total ""survey volume"" is (in Mpc^3) within which all of those galaxies are contained. For context, my data is from a simulation of galaxy formation at redshift ~ 0, rather than from an observational simple -- so in principle I don't think I need to worry about incompleteness corrections at the faint (low-mass) end.   Given my array of stellar masses and the total survey volume in Mpc^3, how do I create and plot the ""galaxy stellar mass function"" that I always see people talking about? Isn't it just basically a histogram of the stellar mass array, and then divide the # of galaxies in every bin by the survey volume (it's almost just like a normalization constant)?   (Of course this question could equally apply to galaxy luminosity functions.)  "

1205,Is it possible for a moon to orbit a planet floating free in the galaxy rather than orbiting a star,"This article got me thinking, can a planet hold a moon in orbit if it is just floating in the galaxy by itself not as part of a star system?

1206,What causes the duration of moon phases (the time the moon is visible above the horizon) to vary for an observer in the northern hemisphere?,"Why does each phase of the moon stay up a different number of hours per phase, so that, for example, January’s full moon was up twice as long as the new moon? Plus every month this bulge shifts and at some point the opposite phase is doubled. Three June full moon nights takes six March 1st quarter nights. Why does this happen? "
1207,Cosmological deflation?,"Wikipedia tells us:     In physical cosmology, cosmic inflation, cosmological inflation, or just inflation is the exponential expansion of space in the early universe. The inflationary epoch lasted from 10-36 seconds after the Big Bang to sometime between 10-33 and 10-32 seconds. Following the inflationary period, the Universe continues to expand, but at a less accelerated rate.   I've no idea about astronomy, I just wondered whether somebody ever published a theory about cosmological deflation, which would make the universe shrink in a fraction of a second.   In a SFI novel you could travel by locally causing a deflation of space in the direction of your spaceship; the unshrunken space of a lightyear would (only locally in front of the ship) measure 1000 km for the fraction of the second. Or maybe a technically very advanced civilization could keep its solar system inflated by the time of a deflation of the whole universe and thus survive, which leads to the interesting question, whether this solar system could reenter the space of the next universe after its new cosmolocical inflation and if yes, does somebody look out for stellar systems at places in space where you wouldn't expect them?  However: cosmological deflation?  "
1208,How close are we to having the technology to measure planetary obliquity for exoplanets?,"As far as I can tell, we do not yet have the precision to even put reasonable bounds on an exoplanets obliquity, but wikipedia seems to indicate that this may be possible in the ""near future."" It seems like this would have to be accomplished by direct imaging, either by directly observing rotational flattening of an exoplanets, or by looking for moons and assuming that the planet is tidally locked to the same plane as its satellite.  How close would you estimate we are to this kind of precision? Are there other approaches to measuring planetary obliquity?  Obviously, I'm not expecting a definite answer. Just wondering if anyone knows of any research in this area or has any thoughts about it. "
1209,How many stars are there in a Globular Cluster of 10^5 solar masses?,"I was wondering whether there is an easy way to approximate the number of stars in a Globular Cluster (GC) with 10^5 solar masses.

1210,"If we were to see the Sun with our naked eyes from the Orion belt, would all planets be encompassed inside the star? Is this calculable?","When we see a star it looks much bigger in diameter to us than it really is, this picture (extracted from here) explains what I mean:    Notice that the point we see in the skynight, represented by the yellow outer circle, would actually encompass even planets orbiting the actual star, represented by the black dot in the center. In this case we see one planet inside the white circle.  My question is, can the effect of distance and brightness be measured as to know how far would we must be to watch a star that encompasses neptune?, the earth? or does it depend on different factors?

1211,Why did Mercury not appear to transit through the middle of the sun?,"Why did Mercury not appear to transit through the middle of the sun (the equator)? I initially thought that this was because of the ecliptic, but, then I thought that actually we'd see it above the solar equator, wouldn't we? So I'm confused.   This video of the transit from NASA shows exactly what I'm talking about. Mercury is shown relatively low on the solar disk.  I'm looking specifically for why it was visible in the bottom half of the sun, not the top half? "
1212,1:1 resonance of two planets around a star in close proximity - approximate perturbative mathematical treatments?,"This question is primarily about the mathematics of orbital mechanics.  The circular restricted 3 body problem (in 3 dimensions) assumes two massive bodies in circular orbits around their center of mass, and a third with zero mass. It is usually solved in a rotating frame and in reduced units with the separation equal to unity and the period of rotation of the frame of 2π. Five Lagrange points can be found from the pseudo-potential surface in 2 dimensions (as well as some periodic horizontal Lyapunov orbits), and things like halo, Lissajous, vertical  Lyapunov and other periodic orbits can be found when solving in 3 dimensions.  My question is about a relaxation of some of conditions of the problem, allowing for the third body to have a non-zero mass, at least so that the 2nd and 3rd body have some non-trivial center of mass relationship themselves.  I'm asking about orbits that would be periodic (or nearly-so). Mathematical stability is not necessary, small displacements can lead to exponential growth of errors, as long as there is at least one mathematically defined periodic orbit.  For visualization purposes, imagine moving Earth's Moon to somewhere in the region associated with the original Sun-Earth L1 point, but that's just to get the conversation going.  In this case, one could think of the ""Earth"" and ""Moon"" as both being in heliocentric orbits, but so close that they are in a 1:1 resonance. The ""Moon"" would orbit the Sun with an average velocity of about 1% slower than that of the Earth so that their heliocentric orbit period were the same.  Has this kind of configuration been explored mathematically? I don't care if it is 3D or only 2D, nor if all six 2-body interactions are considered explicitly or if there are some simplifications.  Basically, anything that considers some effect of the ""Moon's"" gravity on the ""Earth"" so that it is no longer treated as massless.  There is certainly a body of work on non-unity orbital resonances; 2:1, 3:2 etc. but has 1:1 ever been treated in some way?  Question: Considering a 1:1 resonance of two planets around a star in close proximity (e.g. large asteroid or small moon at Sun-Earth L1) - have there been any approximate and/or perturbative mathematical treatments?  note: original motivation is this answer.

1213,How would the night sky look from inside a globular cluster?,"When the weather is clear, we can look at the stars. And we normally would see several thousands of them, they all being more than a [tex] away from us.

1216,Information Paradox with Hawking's Radiation,"A theory about Blackholes storing the information from the universe.  Being said that Blackholes are condensed mass sufficient enough to break every particle into different elementary particles, broken particles will eventually reach the center(or they break down the time they reach there).  Some say that the information is stored on the surface instead, which can be carried by the Hawking's Radiation.  Questions:   How exactly can Hawking's Radiation carry the information? How is it possible for information to exist at the event horizon?    (If the mass was swallowed by the blackholes then every single particle should be inside the event horizon as they brought towards the black hole at very high velocity and it's becoming difficult to imagine that some particles were left at the horizon itself).  Maybe: If the information is on the event Horizon then it might not have broken to elementary particles! "

1219,How does the Hubble telescope capture long-exposure photos?,"I recently learned (if I understood correctly) that the famous Ultra Deep Field photo(s) required something like a 10-day exposure on a very tiny piece of the sky to achieve. How can this occur when the telescope is constantly in motion zipping around earth at ~17,000 mph? Wouldn't the earth and/or possibly the moon get in the way every 90 minutes or so?

1223,Is a supernova powerful enough to destroy the other star in a binary system?,"(This question was originally posted via World Building, but I was instructed to post it here) [website]The question is basically the same:  Can a binary star system have one of the two stars go supernova in the first place, and if so:  The first scenario would be:   Star A of the binary swells to red giant status, and then is either touching or consumes star B: what would happen?   Scenario 2:   Star A goes supernova, with maybe 1 AU of distance between it and Star B.    What info Id like to know:   Can it destroy the other star via supernova?

1225,Moving-Cluster method for determination of the distance of Hyades. A starter problem,"I am currently following a class of observational astronomy lab. I will present a brief description of the method in first and then proceed to the question, so anyone is welcomed to read the entire post or move directly to the problem. The current question is about the Moving-Cluster method, for which I quote from Wikipedia     In astrometry, the moving cluster method and the closely related convergent point method are means, primarily of historical interest, for determining the distance to star clusters. They were used on several nearby clusters in the first half of the 1900s to determine distance. The method is now largely superseded by other, usually more accurate distance measures.*     One can find more here [website]From photographs taken, say, 10 years apart, we can see that a star of the cluster has moved. (It has proper motion.) Let us suppose that the proper motion is an angle μ. Then the angle θ is the angle between the convergent point and the star or equally the angle between the radial and tangential speed of the moving star    If one knows the angle θ, he/she will be able to find the movement of the star and in the end, calculate it' s distance, through deduced relations beginning with [tex]  Question I know the declination and the right ascension of both the star and the convergent point.  My problem as is to find the angle θ. In the exercise I have it is requested to find the angle between the star and the convergent point, that is θ , using spherical trigonometry. My mind goes on to using the cosine relationship:  [tex] for the triangle    But, although it may be simple, I cannot understand where this triangle is to be implemented. What are it' s angles in my problem. Wherever I have looked, the angle θ is taken as granted.  So, should I use something like the triangle? If yes, what the triangle should be? Should the Sun be on one angle as the image above with the convergent point? Should I define another triangle? In the end, for whatever triangle I have thought, how will I calculate the needed sides? Note that I know the right ascension and the declination of both the convergent point and the star's. "
1226,Why is the main sequence often called 'zero age' main sequence?,The main sequence stage for a star begins after it stars burning hydrogen into helium. This is often referred to as the zero age main sequence.  This is confusing since stars have already lived several million years in their pre-main sequence stage.  Where does this come from? Is it a historical designation that just stuck? 
1227,Why weren't the Hubble light-echo images of V838 Monocerotis supplemented by ground telescopes?,"Drawing from this answer     The V838 Monocerotis expansion (not a supernova) and the observation of the subsequent ""spectacular"" light echo was quite a notable event! From Nature 422, 405-408 (27 March 2003)     The Hubble images are quite spectacular (discussed further in that answer). I've included them again below. The color images are 83x83 arcsecconds.  A later conference paper laments the fact that no HST images could be obtained the following year (2003):       ""We received HST observing time at five epochs in 2002 through DD allocations: April, May, September, October, and December. All of the observations were made with the Advanced Camera for Surveys (ACS), which had been installed in HST during SM3b in March 2002. I need not emphasize to this audience how extraordinarily unfortunate it is that no HST observations were obtained during 2003—the loss of this opportunity is truly incalculable. However, the echoes were imaged twice in 2004 through the Hubble Heritage program, in February and October. More happily, the HST Cycle 14 allocation committee did award our team observing time for an intensive HST imaging campaign from October 2005 to January 2006, and we also have two more epochs of observations scheduled in Cycle 15 for late 2006 and early 2007"".   My question is: Why could't observations from one or more of the ground telescopes that are using Adaptive Optics been used to at least supplement the data in 2003? I understand they may not provide the same quality, but not even close? Not even for the polarization mapping? Is it related to the extended area of the target? Is a field of 80 arcsec too large to correct all at once? Is the pattern too complex, or is it the lack of an isolated bright ""guide star"" the problem?  note: I need a reasoned and hopefully quantitative answer, not your ""best guess"" or speculation. Thanks!  Figure 2 of the Nature paper describes the preservation of the actual light curve (history) within the structure of the light-echo shell:       ""FIGURE 2. HST images of the light echoes   The apparently superluminal expansion of the echoes as light from the outburst propagates outward into surrounding dust is shown dramatically. Images were taken in 2002 on 30 April (a), 20 May (b), 2 September (c) and 28 October (d). Each frame is 83"" times 83""; north is up and east to the left. Imaging on 30 April was obtained only in the B filter, but B, V and I were used on the other three dates, allowing us to make full-colour renditions. The time evolution of the stellar outburst (Fig. 1) is reflected by structures visible in these colour images. In b, for example, note the series of rings and filamentary structures, especially in the upper right quadrant. Close examination shows that each set of rings has a sharp, blue outer edge, a dip in intensity nearer the star, and then a rebrightening to a redder plateau. Similar replicas of the outburst light curve are seen propagating outwards throughout all of the colour images.""   From Astronom. J. 135, 2, 2008 or ArXiv       Figure 2. Images representing the degree of linear polarization, p, for each of the four epochs of data shown in Figure 1. Image scales and orientations are the same as in Figure 1.

These images illustrate the apparent outward motion of a ring of highly polarized light in the light echo.  "
1228,Celestial navigation from scratch,"Is it possible to establish one's longitude and latitude by observing the stars?

1230,Was NASA's moon mission completely fake?,"I really want to know whether NASA's Moon mission really was a hoax, or if it is a fact. Since there are many points and scenarios which proves it as being filmed in a film studio with controlled conditions and not exactly on from moon's surface.   I also personally believe that we can not send human beyond ""Van Allen Radiation Belt"". Also mission was announced in 1961 and in just 8-9 years we were able to send humans to the Moon.(really, I think is not possible with today's technology as well. It will at least take 10-15 years to actually do it today). The ISS is orbiting at a few hundred km, and still it has lot of risk factors involved. Crew members are really had near death experiences while carrying out maintenance. And we are able to go to 370,300 km away from earth and safely return back (what ! ! ! really not possible considering today's technology as well-at least for humans). So are these Moon missions a hoax, or a forced lie ?  I don't want to consider any political aspect here (like between the US and Russia etc.) I just want to know whether humans were on the Moon or not ?  "
1231,How does making a refracting telescope very long reduce the chromatic aberration of an uncorrected lens?,"Below are two cropped views of ""Johannes Hevelius's 8 inch telescope with an open work wood and wire ""tube"" that had a focal length of 150 feet to limit chromatic aberration."" from Harvard University, Houghton Library, pga_typ_620_73_451_fig_aa (found here) the first of which I've zoomed and enhanced the contrast.  According to Wikipedia's Aerial telescope; Very long ""tubed"" telescopes:     Very long ""tubed"" telescopes      Telescopes built in the 17th and early 18th century used single element non-achromatic objective lenses that suffered from interfering rainbow halos (chromatic aberration) introduced by the non-uniform refractive properties of single glass lenses. This degraded the quality of the images they produced. Telescope makers from that era found that very long focal length objectives had no appreciable chromatic aberration (the uncorrected chromatic aberration fell within the large diffraction pattern at focus). They also realized that when they doubled the diameter of their objectives they had to make the objective's focal length 4 times as long (focal length had to be squared) to achieve the same amount of minimal chromatic aberration. As the objective diameter of these refracting telescopes was increased to gather more light and resolve finer detail they began to have focal lengths as long as 150 feet. Besides having very long tubes, these telescopes needed scaffolding or long masts and cranes to hold them up. Their value as research tools was minimal since the telescope's support frame and tube flexed and vibrated in the slightest breeze and sometimes collapsed altogether.   A refractor's primary lens produces an image because the angle it deflects is proportional to the distance [tex] from the center of the lens of focal length [tex] as   [tex].  For a dispersive material the deflection at a given point on the lens varies with wavelength, and therefore the focal length of the lens varies with wavelength.    Source  This is called chromatic aberration and its severity for a given type of glass is often expressed by its abbe number.  Question: Is there a simple mathematical way to explain how making the focal length longer could possibly improve a telescope's performance by decreasing the impact of chromatic aberration on its performance?  Or do I misunderstand what the benefits are to making these very long telescopes?       "

1234,Light patch in the night sky,"I am so sorry for being ambiguous. I'm not an astronomer and have have never actually even bothered to look at the sky before. I don't have a telescope nor camera.   Yet, I'm really really curious about what it is I saw in the sky tonight.   Towards, the east I first noticed a ""constellation"" the looked much like what is described to be the big dipper (It is possible that it could have been Andromeda and Pegasus). It was squarish and had somewhat of a ladle towards it's north eastern corner. The most distinguishable feature of the structure was that it had 3 stars in a straight line. It was the straightest line in the entire night sky.  About a hand's length to the west was another ""constellation"", my guts said it's name was Orion. Again, I have never seen, let alone distinguished, a constellation properly in my life. It was like a triangle with it's nose pointing towards the east. The sides that converged to the nose seemed to extend a bit backwards like antennas.  And to the west (a few inches north to the Orion was this strange glow.  At first I thought it was my eyes playing tricks on me as sometimes whenever you stare into light bulb or some other light source, a faint glow in that area of your vision often persists. And as I looked directly at it, it slowly faded away into darkness and all that was distinguishable was an extremely tiny star or two. But whenever I looked to something near it (like a tree or constellation) , the patch reappeared. Then, I noticed that there was cluster of tiny little stars. I couldn't make out much. What caused that light patch? It seemed to glow in and out like it was breathing. I am sure that my eyes weren't playing tricks on me because even as I turned around and tilted my head and jumped up and down in the process, the patch remained in the same spot in the sky.  The location which I observed this is from Ernakulam, Kerala, India. The nearest current sky map I could find is the following from Chennai (which is really far away):  I can't make head or tail of it. Please help and no I'm not crazy. I know it sounds like one of those crazy UFO stories but I assure you it's not.  Is there anything like what I've said observed in the night sky before? "

The fact that the number of counted stars of types O and M is small due to    O is bright but just very rare and, M is common but quite dim.   The puzzling bit in this diagram is the sudden dip from a local maximum F (why is there a maximum) to G (why is G a local minimum). The drop from K to M is explained above - that being that M class stars are just very dim (is this all there is to say here?).  It seems that if there wasn't a dip at 3, and the graph would just continue, that the local max at K can be explained as being there just because there is a dip at G. If there wasn't a dip it wouldn't be a maximum and it'd just look like a bell-curve.  So    Why is there a dip at G? Why does it rise so smooth from O to F? Is it just because B - F are more common? Why is there a maximum at F?  "
1236,How was Cruithne's orbital time calculated?,"How was it determined that Cruithne takes 770 years to complete its cycle with Earth? Janus and Epimetheus were disovered long enough ago, and have short enough cycle times, that we've had time to directly observe their 8 year cycle more than 6 times over. But Cruithne was only discovered 30-ish years ago, so certainly it's cycle time wasn't determined by simple observation.  So what method was used to arrive at this 770 year number? "

Is it true that all ""open"" star clusters have a positive energy (i.e. more kinetic energy that potential energy), while all globular clusters are ""closed"" systems with negative total energy (i.e less kinetic energy than total potential energy) ?  So for example, the Peiades M45 are ""open"" : they have [tex], while M4, M53 and M80 (globulars) have [tex] ?  Is this true ? "
1239,How come the northern and southern lights are the same?,"Not an expert, hence the question. To my knowledge the magnetic field of the earth travels south to north. Wouldn't there be a bias on whether the charged particles causing the auroras are negatively or positively charged? If each pole attracts the opposite, how come they're the same? "
1240,"Why the Circumstellar Habitable Zone is defined as it is, if life could be possible outside of it?","According to Circumstellar habitable zone     In astronomy and astrobiology, the circumstellar habitable zone (CHZ), or simply the habitable zone, is the range of orbits around a star within which a planetary surface can support liquid water given sufficient atmospheric pressure   But then you have moons in the solar system such as Titan, Europe, Enceladus where some scientists believe life could be possible.   The most likely cradles for life inside our solar system  Life on Titan  Why the CHZ is defined as it is, if life could be possible outside of it? Is it pourly defined or scientists believing there could be life outside the CHZ in the solar system are having too much wishful thinking? "
1241,How do we know Milky Way is a 'barred' spiral galaxy?,"In reference to the question, ""How can we tell that the milky way is a spiral galaxy?""  The answers there clearly sum up the question asked. But Milky Way is not just a spiral galaxy. It is further classified as a barred spiral galaxy.  Question: Which particular feature in the distribution of stars, or in general a feature in observations led us to believe that it is a barred galaxy?  Note: The edge-on picture is not sufficient to establish it, since a dense distribution at smaller radii could also arise from a non-uniform density on the spiral disk if modeled to fit the observations. We don't have any data from other angles or orientations. "
1242,angle to the equator of the Sun on sky at a given time,"Is there an easy way to tell at what angle the solar equator is wrt the horizon at any given time of the day? I would think that it rotates 180 degrees from sunrise to sunset, but not in a linear fashion. But solar noon should always be 0 degrees wrt the horizon right? "
1243,What if a Black Hole passed through an Irregular type galaxy?,"So, most of you all are probably (well, why wouldn't you be) familiar with The Magellanic Clouds, and hour they are Irregular type galaxies. You should also be aware that they both orbit the Milky Way, so they act sort of like moons to a planet. Since they (most likely) do not have a central Supermassive Black Hole, I wonder, out of all ridiculousness, what are the answer to these two questions?:  1) What would happen to the Small or Large Magellanic Clouds if a Black Hole (maybe 100 time bigger than the sun) passed though them?  2) What would happen if Sagittarius A* passed through either the Small or Large Magellanic clouds. If you are not aware of Sagittarius A*, it is the Supermassive Black Hole that lies at the center of the Milky Way. "
1244,"What is the difference between Steinhardt's and Neil Turok's cyclic cosmology and Guth's inflationary model and Hartle, Hawking no boundry cosmology?","I have been reading some cosmology and need to ask the experts at this point some specific points. I must admit I am a little confused.   There are a few models of the universe and may be necessary at this point to see if I can sort out the main differences.  In particular James Hartle and Hawking's no boundary quantum state origin of the universe. I believe there may be some minor slight of hand imaginary time element to this to explain away a definite beginning point.   Does this theory compete with the ""standard"" inflationary model by Allan Guth, the one with the inflaton field and infinite inflation complete with multiverse?   There is also Paul Steinhardt and Neil Turok who are not warming up on inflation, and each propose a cyclic model. Are these cyclic models the same?   Do any of these models overlap the string theorists  ""big bangs"" from colliding large extra dimensions called ""Brains""?   Are cosmologists these days heading in any definite direction with some of these complex and difficult for the layman to get a handle on?  P.S. I didn't mean to leave Penrose out of this , he worked with Hawking for some time when Hawking was working on his cosmological theories but I do not know which theory Penrose proposed apart from saying that his lectures appear to shy away from inflationary models proposed by Allan Guth. "
1245,Why aren't ground-based observatories using adaptive optics for visible wavelengths?,"Adaptive Optics (AO) techniques allow ground based observatories to dramatically improve resolution by actively compensating for the effects of Astronomical Seeing.  The atmospheric effects are quite variable in both time and location. A parameter called Isoplanatic Angle (IPA) is used to express the angular extent over-which a given wavefront correction optimized for one point (usually a guide star, artificial or natural) will be effective. As an example, Table 9.1 in this Giant Magellan Telescope resource shows values for IPA scaling almost linearly (actually: [tex])  from 176 arcseconds at a wavelength of 20 microns to only 4.2 arcseconds at 0.9 microns.   This suggests an IPA of 2 to 3 arcseconds for visible wavelengths, which taken by itself is not a killer limitation.  However, it seems almost all currently active AO work is done exclusively in various infrared wavelengths, apparently down to 0.9 microns but no further. (AO is also implemented computationally to array data in radioastronomy.)  Is this because the observed wavelength needs to be longer than the guide star monitoring wavelength? Because it is simply much harder and there is always Hubble above the atmosphere for visible work so it's not worth the extra effort, or is there another more fundamental reason?  I'm not looking for speculation or opinion, I'd like a quantitative explanation (if that applies) - hopefully with a link for further reading - thanks! "
1246,How do we know that the mass ratio of hydrogen and helium in the sun is approximately 3:1?,"From what I learnt, we can find what elements are in the sun by analysing spectrums since each elements has same emission spectrum, and when you look at the sun's spectrum, you can see absorption spectrum missing some lines which is the elements.

1248,"How to make a telescope for viewing planets, moon and DSOs using a convex lens of aperture 100 mm and focal length 200 mm and other lenses at home?","I wanted to make a telescope with DIY things lying around in home. I read up that the aperture was a very important aspect and thus bought a convex lens with 100mm aperture and 200mm focal length, to use it as an objective lens. Apart from that, I have the following lenses lying around:-   1 convex lens    -   focal length 20 cm             aperture - 10 cm  2 convex lenses  -   focal length 17 cm             aperture - 5 cm 1 convex lens    -   focal length 2.2 cm            aperture - 2.5 cm 1 concave lens   -   focal length 8.33 cm           aperture - 5.5 cm 1 convex lens    -   focal length 200 cm            aperture - 5.5 cm   I can also buy lenses of range of Power(In Dioptres) from (-14D) - (+14D) of aperture range of 5.5 cm to 7 cm, if suggested.  I made a telescope using lens 1(as objective) and lens 3(as eyepiece) which on calculation, gave a magnification of 9x, but according to stellafane.org and [website]I would like to know the way to make the telescope, which I would like to use to observe planets and DSOs if possible. I am ready to make separate telescopes also, if suggested.  I would like to know which lenses should I use, or buy and the way to use it. I live in a suburb and it is not very lighted up.  Is there any way I could use the lens 1 in a telescope which I could use to view the planets?  [Edit]  I have accepted @JamesScreech 's answer and am on my way to making it. Apart from that, I would also like to use the big aperture of lens 1, for viewing DSOs, But, it has a very short focal length(just 200mm), and therefore, I am finding it hard to get any eyepiece lens which can ""completely accommodate the exit pupil of my scope""(as said on skyandtelescope )    Any way to get such a lens, or make an eyepiece barrell sort of, using a combination of lenses mentioned above or buying. And how to use it?  Thanks. "
1249,Observing eclipsing binaries,"In a matter of weeks, I will be performing my first observation using a 25-cm Newton telescope (+CCD camera) and would be grateful for advice regarding an otherwise basic research that I have decided to try out due to this occasion.  I will be observing eclipsing binary stars (type Algol), yet have never used any program or site. Just to determine which binaries will be visible at my location on a specific date at a specific time - which sites do you use for this?   Also, what should be my main goals when taking photos in terms of timing and exposition?  Later on, I will use APT for photometry and estimate the time length of the eclipse, which will be my objective.   Thank you in advance. "

The reason I ask is that I want to know if it might be habitable for a possible future colony if they could dig that deep (which might be easier in the lower gravity environment).  If the answer to my previous question is correct, this is the depth that the atmospheric pressure would be equivalent to that on Earth. At what depth on Mars would the atmosphere have equal pressure of that on Earth? "

So by introducing a rogue planetoid, the orbit of both the Moon and Mercury needs to be affected, with at least the former surviving the encounter.  Is this possible? If so, what are the requirements (mass, velocity, proximity)?  Would it be possible for it to happen and affect the Earth minimally, so that it remains habital? "

1257,Population of excited H levels in a Strömgren Sphere,"In chapter 2.2 of Astrophysics of Gaseous Nebulae and AGN Ostriker and Ferland claim that, as far as ionization is concerned, one can assume all atoms to be in the ground state in a Strömgren Sphere setting (static, homogeneous [tex], isothermal [tex] pure hydrogen cloud around a single star). While I do not doubt the validity of this assumption, I have some trouble with how they justify it.  They estimate the inverse ionization rate for ground state hydrogen at a typical distance from the star, which is of course the lifetime against ionization from the ground state [tex]. Then they say that the estimate also holds for ionizations from excited levels and they find  [tex]  where [tex] and [tex] are the typical lifetime against excitation and the typical lifetime of excited states respectively. So far so good. In the next step, however, they end their chain of argumentation by saying that consequently any atom in an excited state will have enough time to decay to the ground state before it can be ionized, so all ionizations are from ground state. That is my understanding at least.  My problem with this is the following: suppose I have some mechanism that keeps a good fraction of my atoms in an excited state. In that case, even if [tex], I will have ionizations from this excited level simply because it is always populated. So what one should really look at in my opinion is the lifetime of an atom against excitation.  My first question is: Am I missing something or did I get something wrong?  And secondly: If my argumentation makes sense, one has to compare the lifetime against excitation with [tex], right? Where can I find the corresponding cross sections for radiative and collisional excitation? I was only able to find ionization cross sections. "
1258,Can smaller habitable planets (or moons) orbit a larger habitable planet?,"I am doing some research for my fantasy novel, but I'd like to really understand how my planet system would cause life to grow if at all possible.

Would the necessary means to spark life occur? "

"
1263,Longitude of Perihelion at J2000?,"My textbook (and lots of other sources) shows the earth's longitude of perihelion at the epoch around 103 degrees. I understand that this means (in the neighborhood of J2000) the earth will reach perihelion about 103 degrees after the vernal equinox, however, this would be very close to aphelion (July 6ish) not perihelion (January 3ish).  Put another way: If the vernal equinox is March 20th &amp; perihelion is January 3rd, shouldn't the longitude of perihelion be about -76 degrees (or 284 degrees)?  Help! What am I missing?  ANSWER--Credit to @Mike_G below, restated here because the final answer is in the comments: ""At the March equinox, the alignment is Earth - Sun - first point of Aries."" Beginner mistake: I was trying to find the earth's position in time but I thought the March equinox was when the earth was between the Sun &amp; first point of Aries, which is the wrong arrangement.

1264,Can there be an object with planetary discriminant between Ceres and Neptune?,"The planetary discriminant is a measure of how dominant a body is within its region of the solar system. For (true) planets, it is [tex] and for dwarf planets it is [tex]. (See this answer to ""How many planets are there in this solar system?"" which explains the related details.)  Is it possible, given what has already been observed about our solar system, for there to be an object with  ""planetary discriminant"" µ between that of Ceres and Neptune?   In other words, could the clear cut line between planets and dwarf planets get fuzzier?     Obviously it would have to be a massive body pretty far out.  Is there a region in the solar system which could be devoid enough of many small objects, which also could be home to a large enough body that we also haven't observed yet?   How does the math work out? "
1265,What's going on in this photo of Halley's comet's tail?,"When researching for this answer I was looking at Space.com's 2011 article Photos of Halley's Comet Through History  I saw the image below, and read the caption.     Halley's Comet in 1910            NASA/JPL      Halley's Comet as photographed May 13, 1910, by a wide-angle camera at Lowell Observatory, Flagstaff, Ariz., during the comet's last appearance. A streak across the comet near the coma is a meteor trail, and not a scratch on the negative. Streaks at the bottom right are the city lights of Flagstaff Bright spot above the city lights is the planet Venus.   I know that 109 years ago astrophotography wasn't what is is today, but the combination of the overexposed venus, the coincident meteor trails, the non-uniform star trails blending in with the comet's tail breakup along with the unlikely looking ""smoke trail"" from the upper side of the comet's tail make this photo look quite unusual.  Question: What's going on with that second tail thing above the main tail? The shape looks so unnatural, it seems to have a parallel extent rather than radiate from the coma. What caused this?    ""bonus points"" for identifying the photo in some catalog, or in a publication. "
1266,Is the curvature of Mars visible from the top of Olympus Mons?,"Would you be able to see the curvature of Mars from the top of Olympus Mons? And how much curvature would you see if it was visible, would it be only barely detectable, or would you see a lot of curvature?  Olympus Mons is 25km high and the tallest known mountain in the Solar System.  Mars is just over half the size of Earth.  Here on Earth, the curvature of the planet is hardly visible from the height of commerical aeroplane (roughly 10km).  I was wondering, considering the height of Olympus Mons and the size difference of Mars, if the curvature from up there would be very pronounced. "

1268,Do interstellar asteroids decelerate and eventually stop?,"I do wonder, do interstellar asteroids eventually stop at one point in space after they gradually decelerate (or) even do they decelerate?   Though there is no air like on earth and thus asteroids will not be affected by frictional forces, do they have friction with gravitational forces against their trajectories?  If it is so, they might eventually stop. Are there any known objects like that?  "
1269,Can Doppler shift make colors of two stars at same distance different?,"As you know, Doppler effect can change the wavelength of the light.  Suppose there are two stars at same distance and same temperature. If one star is receding and the other star is approaching, their colors would look different.  What I want to know is, how probable is it that two stars show different colors because of Doppler shift? In other words, if two stars at same distance have different colors, say blue and red, then is it safe to assume that two stars have different surface temperature?  Actually, this was the question from the final exam for Wave &amp; Heat.     Q. Stars emit radiation whose spectrum is very similar to that of an ideal blackbody. Two stars, identical in size, are at the same distance from us. One of the stars appears reddish in color while the other one looks very blue. Choose the correct statement.      (a) The red star is hotter.   (b) The blue star is hotter.   (C) They could both have the same surface temperature.   I read that some stars near the galactic center moves very fast. [website]If we only consider Planck distribution, only (b) is possible. I'm wondering whether (c) is also a realistic case, or it is only conceptually possible. "
1270,How well do planetary orbits fit with Johannes Kepler's in- & circumscribed Platonic solids?,"In Mysterium Cosmographicum (1596) Johannes Kepler proposed that the relative distances between the orbits of the six ancient planets (six because heliocentrism had recently added Earth as one of the planet) correspond to the geometry of the five Platonic solids. Each planetary orbit was assumed to be the grand circle of a sphere. Each Platonic solid would circumscribe an inner planet's orbitally defined sphere, and in same position inscribe the next outer planet's ""orbital sphere"".   How well does it fit? Is it somehow mathematically related to the equally spurious Bode's law? I would appreciate some hints or links to the geometric calculation itself, for me to compare with my own exercise trying to solve part of it.   Johannes Kepler proposed this order of matching planets with Platonics (I suppose because this order gives the best fit):  Mercury &lt;-- planet  octahedron &lt;-- Platonic solid  Venus  icosahedron  Earth  dodecahedron  Mars  tetrahedron  Jupiter  cube  Saturn "
1271,Detecting habitable planets,From my understanding we detect planets by measuring dips in light intensity from the star the habitable planet is orbiting when it passes by it.  There are 2 things I don’t understand about this method:   Planets in a solar system tend to orbit their star in one disc like plane. Can we only detect planets if this plane is in-alignment with our sensors here on earth/ space. I assume if someone looked at our sun from the ‘bottom’ they would never see a planet cross it. If so this would exclude a big portion of the stars we are looking at?  Our orbit is 1 year. I assume the orbits of habitable plants can vary and having a short/ close to 1 year orbit is not a criteria for habitability. Even so we have to measure 1 dip every year or 10. How can we tell that this a planet with a regular yearly orbit or just anything passing between the star and us. So maybe a better question to ask for number 2 is what can we find out from these dips?   
1272,Which planet or moon has all resources that can be used to sustain life in a controlled biosphere?,"Now that we are making it to Mars, continuing onward, in an effort for humanity to civilize other planets, not just setting up residential colonies, but to mine minerals and carry on geological and scientific research, which planet or moon has all resources that can be used to sustain life in a controlled biosphere?  And how can the available resources on that body be converted to suit human requirement? "

1274,Are there known centaurs which orbit between Jupiter and Saturn without crossing their orbits?,"According to Centaur minor planet     Centaurs are small Solar System bodies with a semi-major axis between those of the outer planets. They generally have unstable orbits because they cross or have crossed the orbits of one or more of the giant planets   Of all the known ones which I've found and I've seen data, all of them overlaps the orbit of Saturn, with the exception of  (514107) 2015 BZ509 which doesnt overlap the orbit of Saturn but the orbit of Jupiter.   My question is, are there known centaurs which dont overlap the orbits of Jupiter and Saturn but which orbit between those 2 orbits? Or does the definition of Centaur mean they have to cross orbits and an asteroid orbiting between those 2 orbits would be called another name if exists? "

1277,What is a Barlow lens?,"I am looking to buy a Celestron 21023 FirstScope 76 Telescope, which is quite inexpensive, and it has good reviews on Amazon.  One thing that many reviewers have said is that the two lenses that it comes with are of low quality, and the suggestion is to toss them and buy a Barlow lens, and perhaps some other more quality lens.  I don't know what a Barlow lens is.    Is this a brand name?  The name of a type of lens?  What distinguishes it from a non-Barlow lens?   "
1278,How is the cost of JWST distributed on different parts of development and operations?,"The James Webb Space Telescope costs nearly 9 billion dollar. What parts of this project cost how much?  I suppose that almost every component has to be developed and is not available to buy off the shelf. So most of the costs should end up as salaries to engineers. I see that the top 10% US specialist aerospace engineers earn 163,000 dollar. The JWST budget covers 54,000 such yearly salaries. Are really thousands of the best engineers working on this project? Or are maybe some materials, like beryllium, very expensive? Like JWST's average cost of about $1½ million/kg. Launch costs are anyway negligible in this context. "
1279,What Is The Great Attractor?,"I've heard that there is something called the Great Attractor which seems to have some kind of gravitational influence on objects in the Universe.

1280,Singularities/ringularities and their properties,"A black hole contains a singularity at its center. It is a zero-dimensional point, and  it's where all its mass is located. So, my first question is:  If a singularity contains all a black hole's mass, when a black hole absorbs matter, the matter should collect at the singularity. Then why does the black hole increase in size? The matter it absorbs is all in the singularity, not in the space around it...  Second, we know that spinning black holes can't have a singularity at the center as a point, because points can't spin, and when they do, they aren't a point. So there is such thing as a ringularity where it is a one-dimensional line bent in a circle that spins, and contains all the black hole's matter.   However, is a ringularity really a bent one-dimensional line in a circle, or an infinite collection of points that form a circle-looking figure?    (My information on ringularities is from a paper published by Cornell University that compared the one-dimensional line to a bunch of zero-dimensional points, and videos by Kurgesagt.) "

1284,Roche Zone of a black hole vs Roche Zone of Neutron Star,"Suppose a very unusually small back hole with the mass of about, lets say, 1.5 solar masses(hawking radiation should destroy a lot of mass let's assume). It thus would have a Roche limit smaller than larger black holes, and the Roche limit should be outside of the black hole instead of inside it, like some supermassive black holes.   Then, let's take a super massive neutron star, perhaps even with quark matter at its center. Even though this may not exist, let's say that is 3 solar masses by taking matter from a nearby red giant rather slowly. This would mean that it thus has a larger Roche limit.  Then, let's fit the two together in a binary system. Move the black hole inwards so that it is in the Roche limit of the neutron star, but its Roche limit is not affecting the neutron star.   My question is that, since a black hole can't physically be ripped apart by gravity due to it being a hole in space time itself, can it's structure be altered in any way by the gravitational pull of the neutron star? Like from a sphere to an oval or something like that? Can it separate into two smaller ones due to the gravity of the neutron star? In the system, who would win the gravity war?   Now assume that the black hole has angular momentum and change, giving it a magnetic field. Then make the neutron star a magnetar of the strongest kind, and place them in the same binary position as I described above. Would their magnetic fields have an effect on any of the bodies that are generating them? Would their magnetic fields have any effect on the other object's magnetic field? "

The blue shift only yields the radial component of Andromeda's velocity vector. It is my understanding that measuring the tangential component is crucial in determining whether a ""collision"" will actually happen (in a gravitationally bound two body system, for point-like bodies to collide, the relative velocity component must point exactly towards the other body, i.e. the tangential component must vanish).  Now, galaxies are not point-like, so some small nonzero tangential component might lead to a collision where at least some galaxy arms intersect.  Has the tangential velocity been measured? If so, how? How central is the collision (bulge into bulge, bulge into arms, arms into arms)? "

1292,Determining the shape of ʻOumuamua via stellar occultation,"As far as I know, our current knowledge regarding the exact shape and size of ʻOumuamua is based on the analysis of its light curve and the assumption that it has a uniform albedo.  ʻOumuamua is very dark and too small to be resolved by even the largest telescopes as much more than a point of light. But so is Ultima Thule and we did manage to get a really good idea of its size and shape by observing stellar occultations caused by it.  Could the same technique be used to get a better idea of what shape ʻOumuamua really is? Or does its hyperbolic orbit render this kind of observation impractical? Have any attempts been made to perform such observations? "

1296,Vacuum of space,"Firstly I’m genuinely interesting in a working explanation for this question. It is for this reason that I am editing the question to fine tune the question. In essense the question has remained the same.   In order for me to check mark the best answer I’m going to ask for citations for the claims made in the answers because I’m getting lots of theory and responders are not in agreement, as far as I can tell. Also I cannot accept circular reasoning i.e. if we assume x then y, since y therefore x. That’s fallacious logical reasoning because x was never proven it was assumed and y might be independent of x.   The vacuum of space is incredibly powerful, 1 x 10-17 torr, and the vacuum between the Earth and the Moon is 1 x 10-11 torr.   How can such a vacuum (very low pressure) in close proximity to the Earth’s atmosphere (high pressure) that goes to 8.5km elevation, coexist with the open system of the Earth’s atmosphere? How does this not defy the second law of thermodynamics and still remain true?  Space is low pressure and the earth’s atmosphere is high pressure. In order to have any pressure the gas requires (demands) that it press upon something.      Pressure is a force exerted by the substance per unit area on another substance. The pressure of a gas is the force that the gas exerts on the walls of its container. When you blow air into a balloon, the balloon expands because the pressure of air molecules is greater on the inside of the balloon than the outside. Pressure is a property which determines the direction in which mass flows. If the balloon is released, the air moves from a region of high pressure to a region of low pressure and the balloon deflates. 1   Earth is an open system that presses against the vacuum of space, why therefore is the second law of thermodynamics suspended if indeed it is a law.  Space is low pressure, therefore the atmosphere which is not in a container should disperse into the low pressure space.

1298,"What is the physical, geometric shape of the universe?","I'm not asking about theoretical ball, vs saddle, vs flat surface which is just a metaphor with 2D space.  It's hard to say as we see very little of it, and we see them in the past because light travels for so long. But what we do know is that it is inflating (not exploding as one might thing from the ""big bang"" naming).   How would the universe look like, if we were to freeze it in a moment, is it likely to be a ball, or rugby ball, a cone or a sort of an irregular shape?

1300,Why do we have the cosmological constant?,"Since the cosmological constant is not required to explain that the universe seem to be expanding, why do we have it?  What other factors cause us to have that constant?  Background: Without the cosmological constant, distant stars should be affected by a great redshift. The amount of redshift is a function of their distance from us. This is due to gravitational time dilation. We are looking 13 billion years into the past, where the universe was very dense. Those stars should be experiencing extreme gravity, causing Einstein shift.  Since we DO have the cosmological constant, we are now looking for other explanations for the redshift. "

1302,Scattered Intensity of Light vs Angles of Incidence and Emission,"So I just derived an expression for the scattered intensity of light from an atmosphere with ideal isotopic scattering: [tex], where [tex] is intensity, [tex] is flux, [tex] is the angle off incidence, and [tex] is the angle of emission ([tex] are normal to atmosphere).  When I plot the scattered intensity as a function of [tex] with [tex] constant, it decreases while the angle increases. Why is this? My theory is that at a large incidence angle, the light encounters a larger surface area, so reflected light will have a higher variation of emission angle, meaning that scattered light at a given emission angle will be lower. Does this make sense? Or is there another reason for this?  Next, I plotted scattered intensity as a function of [tex] with [tex] constant. This time, the intensity increases with increases emission angle. I don't have a theory as to why this is the case, nor an intuition to back it up. Why would this be the case? "
1303,Rotation and relativity,"When a planet is spinning around its own axis, it has an effect on the trajectory of its satellites. I believe it is called frame dragging.

What is the effect of the spin? Lets say that Earth suddenly started spinning faster, what would happen to the moons trajectory? "
1304,Is gravitational lensing a good way to search for negative mass?,"Is it possible to verify negative mass with gravitational lensing?  The following video proposes an idea that galaxies are surrounded by negative mass: [website]Could this be proven or disproven by looking at gravitational lensing of distant galaxies, by looking at Hubble Deep Field images?  I would expect if negative mass surrounded a galaxy, it should cause the opposite effect of the positive mass galaxy.  If there is surrounding negative mass, there should be an “anti” lensing effect just outside the normal lensing effect.  Could someone perform this analysis and confirm or deny that idea?  Edit: In the following image, and others, I have looked to see if I could see such an effect out further from the source visually, and it is hard to tell.  There are so many galaxies in front that aren't affected by the lensing.  It might take a computer analysis of images surrounding the ""ring"" effect to see if there is a ""radial effect"" around the ring.  Most images probably don't show enough of the surrounding area to where the radial effect as predicted in the paper Izumi et al. (2013) would be apparent.  If this is present, I would think it indicates negative mass surrounding the positive mass, and would be a huge discovery confirming negative mass!  If absent, it would likely show that there is at least not a significant amount of negative mass clustered around the galaxies (wouldn't be a total disproof of negative mass).

And if gravity does affect the speed of light, what does that say about our measurements of the distance to the farthest observable object?

Version 1 has the line between η Cygni and β Cygni, appears to go via φ Cygni. Version 3 has the line between η Cygni and β Cygni, goes via a star to the upper right of χ Cygni on the charts.     I want to search for more examples of the different ways the lines in the constellations have been drawn, and all my google fu has failed to produce any useful search terms. Consequently I'm hoping to find there is a term that describes the lines themselves which should be more helpful at finding  material focused on the ways these lines have been drawn. "
1309,Why don't we see the galaxy center?,"When we look at the sky, and see the Milky Way, we mainly see a band, with no real center.  On a more accurate picture we can guess the center of the galaxy (see this picture), but we still don't see the center as some kind of big bright ""star"", like on this picture.  I know there is a lot of objects (stars, planets and dust) between us and the center of the galaxy. But stars are bright and they shouldn't ""hide"" the galaxy center's light since they shine too.  Why don't we see the galaxy center as a ""night sun""?  How much dust is there so it's blocking the galaxy center's light?  Is it because of all Oort clouds of all solar systems that we don't see the galaxy center clearly? "
1310,Is mass+energy conserved when a new universe forms inside a black hole?,"My understanding is that there are credible theories out there in which the formation of a singularity in a black hole also represents the beginning of a new universe via a big bang. We can't see the new universe because we can't see anything from within a black hole. Further, the apparent size of the black hole to us does not have to equal the size of the new universe from the perspective of someone inside that universe. My question is, is mass+energy conserved? That is, is the total amount of material within the new universe limited to how much stuff has fallen into the black hole, or how much stuff has reached the singularity? If so then it would seem these black hole universes are only a tiny fraction the size of our own universe. "

1312,What would happen to a gas planet if its core mass goes beyond the Chandrasekhar limit?,"Hypothetically, let's say we had a gas giant that continued to accrete mass. I've heard that the cores of gas giants are electron degenerate. So if the planet continued to accrete mass and the core mass went beyond the Chandrasekhar limit, what would happen?  In white dwarfs, the result is dependent on the composition. Carbon-oxygen white dwarfs will undergo carbon fusion, leading to a type 1a supernova. Oxygen-magnesium-neon white dwarfs will undergo rapid oxygen fusion, leading to a rapid ignition and supernova but leaving behind a neutron degenerate core.  So would the composition of a gas giant's core play a similar role, if it went beyond the Chandrasekhar limit? What would happen if, say, Jupiter somehow accreted a core mass beyond the limit? "

It seems absolutely improbable to find any such event in that big solid angle.  Do astronomers just appear lucky looking at the right place at the right time to find an interesting event, or do they use some systematic methods of finding them? Do they maybe use special software which analyzes tons of data and identifies such interesting events? "
1315,How long can you be trapped orbiting around a black hole for?,"I have a story I wanna write but I want to be sure it's not completely scientifically irrelevant.  I know there is  black hole modelisation called the Kerr black holes, in which there is a limit around black holes called the event horizon. It's a spatial limit ; no light ray crossing this limit will ever be able to escape the gravity of the black hole. That's the definition of event horizon.  By extension, I guess any physical object (such as a spaceship) crossing the event horizon will be doomed to orbiting around the black hole until it gets destroyed. My question is about the time you can spend between the moment you cross the event horizon (= you are doomed) and the moment you actually die (for example by the tide effect, which basically destroys bodies because of the difference of attraction force between the feet and the head of a human body)? Could this moment last... 100 years ? 1000 years ?  (for my story the more the better)  I know black holes studies are very theoretical, I'd just like to avoid any huge scientific plot holes.  I am quite unskilled in that domain of astronomy, about time dilatation, etc. So if anyone has any idea of the order of magnitude of the time a object can spend beyond a black hole event horizon before it gets destroyed ?   Thanks for your answers :) "
1316,Age and relativity,"This is a question, where I start with some assertions:  Try to consider the universe as a four-coordinate system, x,y,z,t where t is time and where we view a change in t as a change in position, and as a velocity in the same way as any other change in either of the other components of the coordinate. Everything is then moving at the speed of c. The difference between a photon and another particle would be that a photon ""spends"" its velocity in any of the x, y or z dimensions - but not in the time dimension.  This implies that all photons are on the same coordinate in the t-dimension - only the x,y,z values change while t remains 0. It also implies that time would appear to stop for something travelling in only the other dimensions, while it would pass fastest for something completely stationary.  You can then also consider space-time as a function of acceleration. A physical objects' coordinate could be derived from its velocity, which would have to be derived from its acceleration. Acceleration would be a function of entropy, or ""age"" I believe.  Is this the basis of general relativity? Is it at least an initial starting point for general relativity, or is it completely wrong?  Would spin have to be part of the coordinate system? "
1317,Black Holes emitting Hawking radiation,"I've read that even light cannot escape from black holes. The speed of light is theoretically predicted to be the escape velocity of a black hole. I've also read that the general notion that nothing can escape from a black hole is wrong.  Even black holes emit particles and radiation known as the Hawking radiation. My question is: How can black holes emit any kind of radiation? If they even do emit, wouldn't the speed of the radiation be less than or equal to velocity of light? If the escape velocity of a black hole is c, then how can the Hawking radiation even escape the black hole? Wouldn't it be pulled back into the black hole? Then, how is it even  emitting anything? "
1318,Solar Pressure and Gravity,"I recently read some articles and pages on Solar Sails, and the possibility of using lasers to propel spacecraft, and I had a relatively outlandish idea.  Would it be possible for a star to be outputting enough light that planet-sized (or smaller) objects caught in it's gravitational pull would not cross a certain threshold?   A sort of 'reverse blackhole' if you will, where the event horizon is an area that the matter(not light) can not proceed further into the star.  I would assume this to look like a star with a large ring around it, equidistant from any point of the star's center, where matter would coalesce.   Furthermore, would it be possible that an object could remain 'stationary' (ie. not in orbit and no acceleration in any direction beyond the pull of gravity) around this star without fear of gravity pulling it into the star?  "
1319,"Interstellar movie: What is the ""portal"" to the other galaxy?","I recently watched Interstellar with some friends and we didn't come to the same conclusion. In my opinion, the portal they use to go to the other galaxy (to visit the three planets) is not a black hole. My friends tell me it is.  (warning, contains spoiler!!)  To me, it's not because of these points:   When they are in front of the portal, they can see the other galaxy, which is not the case when Coop goes to the black hole at the end When they go to that portal, they ""flow"" in a tube like channel. Again, that's not the case when Coop goes to the black hole at the end. When Coop goes to that black hole, he goes through some sort of light dust that hits his ship, which is not the case when they go to the portal. When the robot (I forgot his name) goes in the black hole, his purpose is to collect some quantic data. If the initial portal was also a black hole, he would have made that collection at that time. When they goes to the portal, they seems ""confident"", but when Coop goes to that black hole, it's for killing himself. If the portal was a black hole, they would behave more identical.   So I believe it's not a black-hole, but what is it exactly (maybe not in scientific terms, but in Interstellar's terms)? A Wormhole? "

1322,How does gravity affect the wavelength of light?,"If, hypothetically, me and my rocket powered flashlight were falling straight toward the center of a black hole. The flashlight is a few kilometers behind me in our travels toward the center of the black hole, but since it is rocket powered, it manages to maintain the exact distance to me for a while.  The point is; The distance between me and my flashlight is constant as long as I am observing it.  The photons coming from the flashlight would obviously not be rocket powered - and they would be affected by the black holes gravitation.  Would the light I see from the flashlight be shifted towards red or blue, even though the distance between me and my dear flashlight is maintained?  If so; switching the positions of me and my flashlight, would it change the color I'd observe?  If we turn off the rocket on the flashlight, I assume it would be redshifted regardless of which were closer to the singularity, and the magnitude of redshift would appear to accelerate? "
1323,"How can the life time of a multiple star system, such as for example the trinary system PSR J0337+1715 be derived?","As for example explained at the beginning of this blog post, the trinary system consists of a millisecond pulsar ([tex] times the mass of the sun) orbited by two white dwarfs. One of the white dwarfs ( [tex] solar masses) is very close to the pulsar and has an orbit period of [tex] d, whereas the other one ([tex] solar masses) is farther away and and needs about a year ([tex] d) to orbit the central pulsar.  Such a three-body system is in principle expected to show a chaotic behavior sooner or later, which means that collisions between these three celestial bodies can be expected and a finit life time of the system can be assumed.  Making some in my opinion way too hand-waving arguments, the blog post further explains that the collisions can not be expected too soon however, by taking into account that the distant white dwarf ""sees"" the inner white dwarf and the pulsar as a single central body and the relative motion of the inner white dwarf around the pulsar is rather stable and eliptic too.   Thinking about such multiple star systems as chaotic dynamical systems, another approach to estimate the liftime could be to make use of some chaos-theoretic methods which could for example involve the Lyapunov Exponent of the system, such that a large exponent would mean that the collisions happen soon and the stellar system has a rather short life time, whereas the converse would be true if the Lyapunov exponent is small (which is what I would expect for the system in my question).  So in short my question is: how can the liftime of a multiple star system be calculated in a not just hand-waving way?  This question is interestingly related to my issue, but it does not yet answer it... "
1324,calculation of characteristic expansion time of the universe,"Hubble's constant is estimated at 15km/s at a distance of million light years, without considering effects of mutual gravity, relativity, etc. I am trying to calculate the characteristic expansion time of the universe. Its formula is given as reciprocal of the Hubble constant, because time is distance by velocity. But:  [tex]  This implies that velocity and distance are exponential functions of time and so time cannot simply be calculated by dividing 1 million light years by 15km/s. So what am I missing? Why is the characteristic expansion time simply the reciprocal of Hubble's constant? "

1326,What could possibly save an atmosphere other than a magnetic field? Why can't a magnetic field save the atmosphere in certain cases?,"Similar question here.  We know as a fact that the magnetic field protects planets from Solar Wind, a damaging, continuous, atmosphere-stripping wind of charged ions. Thus, a magnetic field protected planet will have a stable atmosphere. Vice versa.  Now let's take a look at some examples that logically fit this theory.  Earth  Earth has a liquid iron outer core which conducts electricity generated by convection to form a huge electromagnet[technically].This magnetic field protects Earth from the Solar Wind stripping away its atmosphere. We can see its effect by looking at Earth currently, not nessesarily affected by the damaging effect of such wind on the atmosphere, only to have minor damage by direct hits of CMEs.  Mars  Mars used to have a magnetic field. In fact, some analyzations of the crustal fields recently made by robots sent to Mars have shown that Mars may have even had a stronger magnetic field than Earth. Sadly, about 4 bya[according to Wikipedia], either repeated bombardment from large celestrial objects that disrupted the interior, or the solidification of its outer core have caused the degration of such. Consequently, Mars' atmosphere is being constantly stripped away by the Solar Wind, and its atmosphere is drastically thinner that what is started with.  These are obviously some pretty straightforward examples that fit very well with the first statement.  Then, there are two rather contradictory planets.  Venus  Venus has no magnetic field. It has a very small and dilute magnetic tail according to Wikipedia, where reconnections and many different events happen. The Solar Wind carries the sun's magnetic field lines which wrap around Venus forming a not very protective induced magnetic field, and according to Wikipedia again the area magnetopause and ionopause is a strong[relatively saying] barrier which prevents the Solar Wind from penetrating deeper into the atmosphere. However, this offers in all little protection the Venus. Thus, naturally, we would expect Venus to act like Mars, with its atmosphere stripped away in a few million/billion years. Yet, this isn't the case. In face, what's more interesting is that Venus orbits closer the Sun than Mars, which means that it gets a higher ""dose"" of the Solar Wind, which should strip off the atmosphere rather quickly. Even more interesting is that Venus has a thicker atmosphere than Earth.   On the other question I linked, MacUserT said that      ...the ionosphere of Venus direct interaction with the solar winds causes an externally induced magnetic field...   Even if this is the case, Venus lacks a intrinsic magnetic field[self generated], which is the ""main"" protection. Even with this induced field, this protection is substantially not enough, as the Solar Wind [according to space.com] penetrates relatively deep into the planetary exosphere and causes substantial atmosphere loss. This loss, like Earth thru its poles and the tail, would mainly occur on the tail of the induced magnetosphere. The main losses would be hydrogen, helium ions, and according to Wikipedia, also oxygen ions.   So my question is that how is Venus exactly protected by this ""induced field"" and what is the power of the field? How much atmosphere does Venus lose in one day, and how is this induced field generated?  Now, let's look at another planet with opposite views.  Mercury  Mercury has a large core Mercury also mas a liquid outer core. It is also spinning substantially fast enough so that it can generate a magnetic field stronger that what Mars and Venus have now[It is 300 nT]. However, due to its close orbit, it faces 3 times more pressure from the Solar Wind than that of Venus. This doesn't mean nessesarily that it can't support an atmosphere. My teacher said that Mercury has a very thin atmosphere constantly being stripped away by the Sun made of gasses such as H, He, O, Na, Ca, K, and many other elements from the planetary crust.   However, since it has a relatively speaking, strong magnetic field, doesn't is mean that it should at least have more or less the atmosphere density of Mars? What protection does the magnetic field offer of this isn't the case?   You may be confused so I will I guess put my questions below:  Since Mercury it has a relatively speaking, strong magnetic field, doesn't is mean that it should at least have more or less the atmosphere density of Mars? What protection does the magnetic field offer of this isn't the case?  Answered   So my question is that how is Venus exactly protected by this ""induced field"" and what is the power of the field? How much atmosphere does Venus lose in one day, and how is this induced field generated?  Answered  "

Central and peripheral describe objective directions, because the observer's frame of reference doesn't affect whether something is closer or farther from the middle.  ""Clockwise"" or ""counterclockwise"" don't work, because they depend on which side you're viewing from.  Are there names that can describe one object's location relative to another object, either in the galaxy's direction of spin or against it?  Or words to describe whether something is farther or closer out along a particular arm of a spiral galaxy?  "
1328,How does light affect the universe?,"When light is emitted by for example a star, that star loses energy - which causes it to reduce its gravity. Then that energy begins a journey for potentially billions of years, until it reaches some other object.  When that light reaches a surface, such as another star or galaxy, it will give that energy to the destination star in the form of heat. This causes the receiver to increase its energy, in turn restoring a sort of balance. It also causes the receiver to emit a minute amount of more light again, almost like a reflection.  It will also excert pressure on the receiving surface once it reaches its destination, be it a star, a rock or anything else.  But while that light is travelling through space, its energy is ""unavailable"" to the rest of the universe. Naturally I ask the following question:   Will light cause gravity, while it is traveling?  Every single star emits light in every direction, and will eventually reach every other star in the universe. At any single point in the universe, there must be a continous ray of light coming from every single other star in the universe, that has a direct path to that point. Given that all stars on the sky is sending photons that reaches every square centimeter of the earth surface, the amount of pressure should sum up to be quite large.  Is the amount of pressure really neglible, given that every single atom on any surface is receiving light from every single lightsource on the sky?  Based on a calculation found at [website]"
1329,How does a Solar Transit give more accurate determination of Earth-to-Sun distance?,"I understand how Solar Parallax calculation determines the Earth-Sun distance using measurements of (a) the baseline distance between two widely-separated terrestrial telescopes and the (b) two angles - one at each telescope - between the baseline and the line from telescope to the centre of the Sun's visible disc.   How is it that observations of the transit of a planet across the face of the Sun give better results than simply pointing (simultaneously) each telescope at the centre of the Sun's visible disc?  Is the Solar Transit method also superior (in terms of accuracy) to the method of determining Earth-Planet distances by measuring parallax angles relative to 'fixed' background stars?  If so, why? "
1330,Is space a thing?,"Based on my extent of knowledge relating to astrophysics, I once thought space is a thing, which can be twisted a long side with Time regarding masses of objects(According to relativity theory).  But I found out in this comment session of the following thread (I put the link following to this paragraph), I was pointed out as Space is not a thing, but space is the totality of geometric relations (distance, angle, etc) between things. And my confusion started.   Do interstellar asteroids decelerate and eventually stop?  How is it possible that the space can be twisted, if the space is not a thing? or is it?  "
1331,Martian Brother,"According to some documentaries History and Discovery, fossils have been found in a meteorite that fell to earth. This meteorite came from Mars.  It is possible that the Martians always try to be bacteria or unicellular. It is possible that single-celled organisms that evolved into multicellular beings and then to beings we know.  So possibly we are Martians (acestral have a Martian, a bacterium).  My question is, does on Mars, before the earth existed humans?  If that were to be existed underground, or another planet were extinct?  If there were other humans on Mars, then we live in parallel ignorance of each other. So we may be extinct before meeting our Martian (or other planets now) brother?  Have we discovered but scare our discoverers by our violent attitudes and our boundless ambition? "
1332,How did Meeus calculate equinox and solstice dates?,"In Astronomical Algorithms (2nd ed, ch. 27, 2009 corrected printing) Jean Meeus gives expressions to calculate the date and time (dynamical time, equivalent to Terrestrial Time) of equinoxes and solstices from the year -1000 to the year +3000. The expressions are accurate to 51 seconds or better for the years 1951-2050. First what Meeus calls the ""instant of the 'mean"" equinox or solstice"" is calculated using a fourth degree polynomial; there are 8 expressions. There are different expressions for each solstice or equinox, and different expressions for the year ranges -1000 to 1000 vs. 1000 to 3000. Then two corrections are applied; the corrections are calculated the same way no mater which time period or equinox or solstice is being corrected. The first step is to calculate:  [tex]  [tex]  [tex]  Next, an additional correction is computed involving 24 periodic terms with various periods.  Can anyone explain, in general terms, how Meeus derived these expressions? I'm especially interested in understanding what the ""mean"" value represents? "
1333,What's the reason that we have a different number of days each month?,"It always was interesting for me to understand the answer for the question:     What's the reason that we have a different number of days each month?   If the month is fixed on the time that the moon circles the earth, then the time of the circling isn't equal each month? And if the month fixed by the time that the earth circles the sun and then divided by 12 (365:12=30.4), why one month has more days and the other month has less days?  Before desktop computers, how did astronomers handle calculations of dates and times accurately, for example two plates taken decades apart, how would an astronomer calculate the time difference precisely?   "
1334,Is the discovery of Alien or Extra Terrestrial Life a function of the science of Astronomy?,"Is the discovery of Alien or Extra Terrestrial Life a function of the science of Astronomy? When i read astronomy articles on the search for new Planets or discussions on Mars a lot of the topic is on the planets occurring in the habitable zone and the possibility of life on them or stories on the possibility of previous life on Mars. Is this actually part of the science objectives for the Astronomy community, or is there another branch of science who is tasked with this? Is Astronomy only focused on the mechanics of celestial bodies and the discovery of Alien or Extra Terrestrial life is just and interesting sidebar?   "
1335,Binary pairings that haven't been discovered yet?,"Question: Are there any kinds of binary pairings that haven't been discovered yet? Any that are particularly significant, or that might shed some light on binary stellar evolution or theories of capture processes, that are sought, but so far no examples have been found or at least suspected?  By ""pairing"" I mean a binary object where each is a type of star or a black hole.  Stars can be anything from brown dwarfs to neutron stars. Black holes should be very roughly comparable to stars in size. (I'm not asking about a star in orbit around a supermassive black hole in the center of a galaxy)  For example, recent observations of gravitational wave events have suggested a pair of black holes merging, and a pair of neutron stars merging. "
1336,How can satellites be safe in the atmosphere when there are so many asteroids coming in?,"How  can artificial satellites be safe in the atmosphere when there are hundreds of tons of dust and asteroids coming into earth's atmosphere everyday?   What is an orbit of an artificial satellite? At what approximate distance (or which orbit) from artificial satellites do these asteroids, dust, rocks annihilate?  "
1337,Are we made of the stuff of one star or more stars?,"   [T]his coincidence enabled stars in the late stages of their lives to turn helium into carbon, oxygen and most of the other atoms that you and I are made of. [...] [W]e're made of star stuff.   Max Tegmark, Our Mathematical Universe: My Quest for the Ultimate Nature of Reality, p. 64  Assuming that the Sun is not in the late stages of its life, I read that as that we are made mostly of star dust, but not Sun dust. Rather, we apparently are mostly made of atoms produced by earlier (now dead and buried) stars.  My question is whether it is likely that there was one immidiate (o.a. carbon-producing) predecessor star to the Solar System, or whether the Solar system likely has more than one (perhaps many) (o.a. carbon-producing) ""parent stars""? (And, there seems to be also also a third ""possibility"": that the build-up of, say, carbon takes more than one generation of stars.) What's the (hi)story here? "
1338,How to plot orbit of binary star and calculate its orbital elements?,"I have a set of dates, position angles ([tex]) and angular separations ([tex]) for visual binary star. For example:  1994.3132  57.0    0.097 1996.1783  73.4    0.051 2006.1938 182.0    0.126 2009.2597 192.9    0.152 etc.   What are algorithms to calculate orbital elements and to plot the orbit of the binary star?  Are there available codes (or programs) for this calculations? "
1339,Calculate time when star is above altitude 30°,"To find the best observation time for an object, I'd like to calculate the time when it is 30° or more above the horizon. Local Sideral Time would be sufficient.  To include that in my program, I need the formula.  Example: On June 4th, Jupiter has the coordinates RA= 9h 19m 28.0s Dekl= 16° 32' 0""  It rises at 10:32 and sets at 00:05.  After rise, when is it at altitude 30°, and after transit, when is it at altitude 30° again ?    I found this formula at [website][tex]  Applied to the sample assuming a latitude of 45° I get.   Is this the correct approach? "
1340,Will new stars stop forming at some point of time?,"New stars keep forming in the universe thanks to all the nebulae. Now, we need Hydrogen to form stars and there would a time when all the hydrogen will get exhausted, and no more star formation will take place, theoretically.  Will there practically be such a point of time? I guess there is no place where hydrogen is replenished after star formation. Or is there a feedback cycle? "
1341,First observation that the movement of a planet or asteroid in its orbit was affected by another planet?,"Answers to the question How did Kepler determine the orbital period of Mars? describing careful observations centuries ago got me thinking.  Question: What was the first analysis of observations that directly demonstrated that the movement of a planet or asteroid in its orbit was affected by gravitational attraction by another planet?  I don't mean inferences based on the spacing of orbits, I'm thinking of detailed positional measurements; something like planet/asteroid A was X kilometers or Y arcseconds away from it's predicted position and it couldn't be accounted for if not for the gravitational effects of planet B.  I am not sure if First observation that the Sun and Jupiter (and friends) move around a common barycenter? is a completely separate question, or if this confirmation happened all at once, but I've currently asked it separately. "
1342,Pictures of large galaxies,"The Andromeda Galaxy is tens of thousands of light years in diameter. That suggests that the most distant stars in the Andromeda galaxy is up to tens of thousands of years ""behind"" in their orbit around the galaxy, compared to the closest stars. Have anybody generated pictures of the galaxy, which shows the approximate real position of stars? Is this effect visible when looking at the Andromeda galaxy through an amateur telescope? "
1343,Are nebulae only visible from a distance?,"There's plenty of data about the density of nebulae, and obviously they're pretty thin.  This is space, after all, and these things are really, really big.  But I'm wondering about the practical experience of that density.  Are the colorful patterns of gas only visible when you're far away and looking through them, or if you were inside a nebula would you see colors all around you instead of the black of space?  Are any dense enough to obscure the view between planets of the same solar system?  Between a planet and its moon? "
1344,First observation that the Sun and Jupiter (and friends) move around a common barycenter?,"Answers to the question How did Kepler determine the orbital period of Mars? describing careful observations centuries ago got me thinking.  What was the first analysis of observations that directly demonstrated that the Sun and the outer giant planets were moving around a common barycenter rather than all planets rotating around a fixed Sun?  I am not sure if First observation that the movement of a planet or asteroid in its orbit was affected by another planet? is a completely separate question, or if this confirmation happened all at once, but I've currently asked it separately. "
1345,Can redshift be measured using fourier?,"Are there pictures that contain high enough dynamic width, so that amateurs can use fourier spectrum analysis to observe the redshift themselves?   I know pictures usually are encoded using RGB and/or CMYK and therefore lose a lot of color information from a physical perspective, but I'm wondering if there exists a picture format that could store that much information, and if so, could amateurs then use fourier spectrum analysis to actually see the red-/blueshift? "
1346,What more could be learned from a rare astronomical event if we knew precisely when it would occur?,"This is actually related to a question I recently asked on Worldbuilding, but seemed more appropriately asked here.  To keep this from being too broad in scope, let's assume that someone figured out the exact moment that Eta Carinae will go supernova (I wouldn't hold it against anyone if they suggested a more scientifically interesting event).  Due to this foreknowledge, we could point every telescope we have in its direction for the main event.  Is there any science we know we could do/learn from this event that we wouldn't get by reacting to it after the fact?  I know such an event would generate data for a century or more to come, but I'm interest in the moment of the explosion.  Somewhat related, is there anything we would/could do now to prepare for it if this event were going to happen today? "
1347,Does gravity propagate?,"Gravity is sometimes described as a curvature in space-time. Due to relativity, doesn't this imply that gravity doesn't propagate?  A thought experiment. If you are moving toward a black hole, this could also be considered as if the black hole is moving toward you. If a black hole was moving toward you at the speed of light, and gravity propagates at the speed of light, you would experience something similar to a supersonic blast, except its a gravity blast, and it would allow you to remain unaffected until you arrived at the very centre of the black hole?  If you were able to turn around, just before you arrive at the center, and travel away from the black hole at the speed of light you would never notice it, even though you would be travelling at the same velocity as the black hole in the same direction? "
1348,Does Universal Time really track mean solar time?,"At innumerable places on the net you can find the claim that leap seconds are inserted into UTC in order to make it track UT1 which again tracks mean solar time at the reference meridian.  However, when I tried to locate an actual definition of UT1, the closest I could find was IAU resolution B1.8 from 2000 which seems to define it implicitly from the following relationship with the Earth Rotation Angle: [tex]  Here the magic constant 1.00273781191135448 appears to be derived from the ratio between the Earth's rotational period and the sidereal year -- but no provision for adjusting it for observed changes in that ratio seems to be made. (The least significant several digits of the constant must be wrong already).  As the Earth's rotation slows down, is UT1 therefore going to drift out of sync with mean solar time at the IERS reference meridian? Or am I missing something? "
1349,Did time pass more slowly in the past?,"13 billion years ago, the universe was about 600 million years old according to many scientists. At that time, all matter in the universe would have to be closer, or in other words denser.   Did time pass more slowly, at that time, relative to now? I ask, because increased gravity causes time to pass more slowly.  If we'd been there, and measured the speed of light as we measure it today, would the speed of light be different?  Finally, does distant stars look magnified, given that a ""tiny"" universe is stretched on our entire sky?  I assume then that we'd measure time based on caesium 133 and distance not as a function of the speed of light, but as a theoretical physical ""device"" that would be the same physical length then and now. "
1350,Heavy star and redshift,"A heavy star should look redshifted, due to gravitational time dilation. How is that incorporated into the calculations of distances to the stars, or is it negligible?  How about an entire region of space that is denser or more energetic than our region? Would that not appear further away, than another region that is less dense than our region?  If we were in a region of low density and energy, and the density of space increases as we look further away, is that something that could theoretically explain Einsteins ""blunder""? Can one be sure that this is not the case?  If the universe were collapsing, and gravity does indeed propagate. Wouldn't all distant regions seem to be affected more by gravity than the region of the observer, and thus ever more redshifted? (this due to less gravity in ""front"" of an approaching region of space than ""behind"" it, relative to us)  I'm curious of how these things are found to be important or unimportant on a cosmic scale.  "
1351,Has stellar evolution ever been modeled analytically?,"I'll still remember the handout my astronomy professor gave us more than several decades ago; Our Friends the Polytropes. We spent a lot of time learning how polytropes, simple analytical power-law models could reproduce some basic thermodynamic properties of stars, and how those properties would tend to vary with mass (and perhaps other parameters, I don't remember now).  Have polytrope models of stars (or other simple analytical models of stars) ever been ""evolved"" analytically in time? In other words, in addition to variations on radius, have a set of equations ever been written which also included a [tex] in such a way that they were amenable to an analytic solution?  note: I've added the history tag since I'm asking about the ""gold 'ole days"" rather than about modern techniques. "
1352,"When a rogue brown dwarf star hits a white dwarf star, will the collision at most cause a nova?","When a rogue brown dwarf star hits a white dwarf star, will the collision at most cause a nova? Or can the explosion be heavier? "
1353,Could dark matter particles be unstable?,"Is it possible that dark matter particles are unstable and the existing dark matter will decay in the long run and turn into hydrogen, for example? What would be possible mechanisms for such a decay?  Could some of the hydrogen we observe be ""new"" hydrogen, i.e. be the product of dark matter decay? "
1354,What is the relationship between the focal length and f number of a telescope compared to a guide scope?,"How do you determine the optimal length of a guide scope for a given imaging telescope?  I imagine it would have to take into consideration the pixel size of the guide scope, but would the aperture matter as well? "
1355,Sun's spectrum red shift,"Does Sun's spectrum expose any red shift at all? Namely, the center of it's visible area (not due to limb effect). If it does, how much is it and does it comply with relativity theory or is it higher/lower than theoretically predicted?   I red about it an article dated 1960 ([website]"
1356,How many minutes does a sundial change every day?,"I'm planning to create a sundial in Ghana (10° 28.852', 0° 26.032') in July 2014. I will stay there for about 3 weeks. Do I need to adjust the numbers anywhere in these 3 weeks? I know the shadow's path changes through the year, but how much does it change? Is the change significant for a sundial?  (btw, is this the correct site to ask or should I use the astronomy site?) "
1357,Appearance of the Cresent,Does the latitude of your position on earth change the appearance of the cresent like it changes the position of other objects visible in the sky? Does it rotate it? 
1358,How should I think about sunlight for the purposes of analyzing the angles it makes w/ earth?,"Most diagrams I see of sunlight look like something like this:  .  They show that for basic geometric analyses, the sun's radiation can be thought of as 'thin lines' that strike earth. Further, at an equinox, those rays strike hit the horizon of every point on earth (except the poles) directly from the east. So, the diameter for the earth does not matter at all it terms of the angle at which the rays strike.  I'm curious - how far will this conceptual frame take me? What is a better way to conceptualize how the sun's light strikes the earth? "
1359,Best locations for large telescopes at high northern latitudes,"Large optical telescopes want to be located at high altitude (get above as much of the atmosphere as possible). I get the impression that there is also a preference for low latitude (see as much of the sky as possible). And perhaps also for a location with good weather, so that there will be as few cloudy nights in the year as possible? So for example, many large optical telescopes are on the summit of Mauna Kea, Hawaii; there is also McDonald Observatory in Texas.  Suppose you wanted to put large optical telescopes as far north as possible, but still meet the other requirements, what would be a good location? Looking for high mountains at northern latitudes is an obvious starting point, but how well would that meet the requirement of clear skies? For example, Mount Washington in New Hampshire is the highest peak in the north-eastern United States, but has notoriously terrible weather; this would be an important downside? "
1360,What is the difference between our time and space time?,"I am trying to understand the phenomenon of space-time. But, everything on internet seems to be too complicated for me since I do not have a background in physics. Can anyone give me simple explanations for the following:   What is the difference between time and space-time? How does gravity affect the passage of time?  What is the speed of light and how does it relate to time?  How do scientists deal with timescales on the order of billions of years if time is not constant for all observers in the universe? How is time, or for example the age of the universe, actually measured experimentally?   "
1361,Spacetime curvature illustration accuracy,"When a particle travels through spacetime, this is sometimes illustrated moving in flat grid with various depths. How accurate is this way of imagining gravity?  Can the gravity well be infinitely deep?  Gravity well [website]Looking at this illustration, it suggests that there is an amount of distance going down the well. Is movement down the well limited by the speed of light? Remember, I'm aware that it is an illustration, and the question is about the accuracy of the illustration.  Is all gravitational wells infinitely deep at the exact center? So that if a particle could be made small enough to fit within the center, it would become a black hole. "
1362,Which is the largest planet ever observed?,"I don't know much about planets outside our solar system. Do we even know the limit of the size of how large a planet or satellite can be? The largest planet I know of is Jupiter, but could there be planets as large as our Sun or even larger? Is there a theoretical limit to the size of a planet? "
1363,Is it possible for the year to have 11 full moons (i.e. the opposite of a blue moon),"A blue moon is so called for when we have 13 full moons in a year.  [website]Is it possible to have 11 fun moons in a year? (Maybe if we included calendar changes, for example the start of the Gregorian calendar, this would be more likely)  If this is possible, what is this phenomenon called, and how rare are these years? "
1364,Is our universe included inside a black hole?,"This question repetitively comes to my mind but I've never found any good scientist article to argue about it, only esoteric or speculative web articles without much valuable background.  So let's suppose we're in the middle of a ""black hole"" ...  To me, here is why this would make sense:   Big bang  The word big bang itself may be inapproriate, indeed it is said to be an ""explosion"" but an ""explosion"" without any center.    With the idea of being inside a black-hole, it is easier to represent this as being the matter entering the black-hole. From our position, and as we are attracted by the singularity, everything seems to expand wherever we look at. And as far as we can look at, we can only see the cosmic background radiation. Dark matter  On the contrary of matter entering the black-hole, dark matter is the matter already in front of us and we'll never be able to access it as its light (i.e. information) cannot go backward within the singularity. Time/Gravitation  Time is a dimension like any other and as we feel x,y,z dimensions as a field of view, we fell time as an irrepressible attraction toward the singularity. Gravity may be see also as a less irrepressible dimension (depending on mass around). Other black holes  Other black-hole we ""see"" may let us envision the shape of the universe not as simple torus, but higher dimensional ""toric"" shape with ""connections"" everywhere (maybe shapes like high order atomic orbitals ?).   Is there any reasonable scientific background to argue/contradict about this ? "
1365,Why is dark energy preferred to the cosmological constant?,"Dark energy and the cosmological constant are often identified, but Peebles and Ratra explain that      ""Einstein did not consider the cosmological constant to be part of the stress-energy term... a new constant of nature,    [tex], appears in the addition to Einstein’s original field equation. One can equally well put Einstein’s new term on the right hand side of the equation, and count [...] as part of the source term in the stress-energy tensor. The distinction becomes interesting when [tex] takes part in the dynamics, and the field equation is properly written with [tex], or its generalization, as part of the stress-energy tensor.""   In other words, Einstein treated [tex] term as a modification of GR with a ""new constant of nature"", while dark energy may potentially manifest itself in some other ways. Later they write about dark energy:     ""The idea that the universe contains close to homogeneous dark energy that approximates a time-variable cosmological “constant” arose in particle physics, ...in cosmology..., and on both sides by the thought that [tex] might be very small now because it has been rolling toward zero for a very long time. The idea that the dark energy is decaying by emission of matter or radiation is now strongly constrained by the condition that the decay energy must not significantly disturb the spectrum of the 3K cosmic microwave background radiation.""   So if I understand this correctly the idea of a dynamical effect came from suspecting that [tex] may be time dependent, but so far that was not detected. And since ""one can equally well put Einstein’s new term"" on either side of the equation mathematically both interpretations are equivalent. Still, the dynamical interpretation seems to be overwhelmingly preferred.     Are there empirical reasons for conjecturing dark energy, some spatial non-uniformity in expansion perhaps? If not, what are the theoretical reasons for preferring it to the cosmological constant of modified GR?   "
1366,How can we tell how many exoplanets a star has?,"Part of this answer (discussing the moving center of mass of our solar system) explains that this movement is one way we know a star has planets:     Bonus: We use this phenomenon to find planets outside the Solar System! If a distant star is observed to 'wobble' or oscillate about it's mean position, we can use that data to infer the presence of one or more exoplanets, and calculate their mass.   It makes sense to me that we could tell that a start has some planet(s) in orbit around it, based on how they affect the star's position. But is this movement really precise and predictable enough to pin down how many exoplanets, and how large they are? Can we produce a ""map"" of a distant solar system based on this movement?   If needed, we can even restrict the discussion to planets that are ""big enough"" to detect. For example, when performing this exercise on our Sun, would we be able to accurately predict at least the four gas giants, even if we couldn't get Mercury? "
1367,Day Length on Double Planets,"Assume two similarly sized bodies tide-locked to one another orbiting a barycenter between the two. That barycenter orbits a star. Since the two are tide-locked, their sidereal rotational period and sidereal orbital period (about one another) are the same (right?). There's no axial tilts or eccentricities to screw with things either for the sake of simplicity.  What would I base the length of a conventional day on for a society living on these worlds?  My gut's telling me to calculate the sidereal period based of the barycentral semi-major axes (or would I use the separation between the two worlds still?) for each and then compute the synodic periods and just use those, but my brain's too stupid to tell whether that's going to actually be anything close to a ""solar day"". I don't need perfect - just close enough. "
1368,Hydrogen and oxygen in space,"chemistry tells us that when mixing hydrogen and oxygen the result is an explosion and water.  my question is: does this happen on astronomical scale? for example, did they ever observe planet-size hydrogen cloud collide with planet-size oxygen cloud to produce a huge explosion and planet made primary of water? "
1369,radial velocity fitting of a binary,"I have two series of velocities (HJD, [tex] and [tex] ), how to fit in detail?  There is any formula on the web? [tex] curve is easy, but I need to consider an eccentric orbit.   Suppose we can estimate [tex], [tex], and inclination angle [tex], if we just know velocities of both of the two companions, which parameters can me derive?  What is the difference between binary velocity fitting and star+planet fitting? "
1370,How accurate are rederings of something entering Earth's atmosphere?,"Supposedly how accurate is it when you see a movies showing something entering Earth's atmosphere traveling 1 mile to 10 miles an hour or barely at all but skinning the atmosphere they show it heating up and burning just by entering the atmosphere no speed or barely just entering?  As a second question, something coming in - say, a vehicle with rockets - to ensure that the speed does not exceed that would cause  any heating at all. What speed would that be? "
1371,Planetary orbital resonances,"The Kirkwood gaps in the asteroid belt are associated with orbital resonances with Jupiter yet planets seem to prefer resonant locations. Why don't asteroids accumulate near the ""Kirkwood locations"" rather than avoid them?? "
1372,Why Only Saturn Has Visible Rings,"It may be surprising to know that all four giants in our solar system have rings orbiting around them.  Yet only Saturn has a system of rings visible to the naked eye.  Why is that?  What's so different about Saturn in comparison to Jupiter, Uranus and Neptune that makes it the only planet to have a visible ring system? "
1373,Metalicity and age of bulge stars vs halo,"From what I understand of current models, the bulge of the galaxy formed first, and thus, would contain older population II like stars. Currently, however, the halo has a higher population of stars with lower metalicity than the bulge. Is this because the density  of stars in the bulge is much higher? My thinking is that this is a densely populated region of massive hot stars that die quickly and create a newer region of next generation population I stars that are metal rich. The inverse would be true for the halo where stars are less densely packed. Is this correct? "
1374,Pulsars: How do astronomers measure minute changes in period (~picoseconds per year)?,"I've been to some talks that mention how stable the period of a millisecond pulsar is over long periods of time. Recently, it was mentioned that astronomers have calculated the change in period over time to be less than 10^-12 seconds per year for several pulsars. No one I've talked to seems to know any details of this calculation. How do we calculate such small differences in period? How much data must be collected and what are the exposure times for imaging such rapid phenomena? A source/paper would be excellent. I apologize that I don't have a citation for the 10^-12s figure, but the lack of citation is mostly my reason for posting this question. "
1375,Night sky timelapse - SO MANY METEORS?,"I have really little knowledge of Astronomy in general. Last Monday, I tested my new camera by doing a Night-Sky timelapse. After a little post-processing, i noticed dozens of light streaks going in all directions.   I can't tell if those are meteors, airplanes or satelites.   Could you help me out?

1376,How ready are we to deal with a asteroid/comet/giant-meteor on a collision course with Earth?,"I keep hearing astronomers saying there are observatories scanning the skies all day and night looking for near-Earth objects, extrapolating their trajectories.   My questions are   If we were to get the news of an on-coming object, how early we will find out or how much time we will have?   Currently, people don't even think about it; Governments are cutting spending in their space exploration programs, let alone deflecting an impact-er.  Under certain circumstances, would the notice from the watchdogs be enough for us to build something that would prevent the loss? "
1377,Would a telescope that uses Fresnel lenses be more practical than using regular lenses?,"If we were to make telescopes with Fresnel lenses instead of regular lenses, would it be more practical?

1378,How did WASP-18b exoplanet form?,"I am new to this community and not quite sure if this is an appropriate question to be asked here. Anyways its just my curiosity. As far as I could know about WASP-18b is that, it orbits very close to its sun and takes less than 24 hours to complete one orbit. However this was not the case always, as the planet actually was formed in a cold part of the space and later got tug into of its sun's gravitational pull.   Given this is the case, I am curious to know how it was formed in the first place? If I am not wrong planets are formed when the debris orbiting in the gravitational pull of a star stick together overtime gets in to the form of the planetary bodies. So, if WASP-18b was not always so close to its sun and it was formed far away in cold space, then could there be a possibility that, this exoplanet was formed in an orbit of another star and overtime it got away from its original orbit and trapped in the tug of its current sun? (Its my imagination! just bare with it :))    Also could any one point me to good documentations from where I can learn more.   Thanks "
1379,"In 31.5kyr, Epsilon Eridani and Luyten 726-8 will be < 1ly close; but how distant from the Solar system?","Greetings! Based on Wikipedia and more precisely this paper, it is said that, in about 31,500 years, the stars Epsilon Eridani and Luyten 726-8AB will ""meet"" at a very close distance (less than 1 light year); I found that anecdote very interesting in the context of some SF writings I'm trying to do (not in English, quite obviously!) to bring some ""subtle consistency"" in it, but I was unable to either answer nor calculate with my very little knowledge of astronomy this simple question: to what distance will those stars be from the Solar System in 31,500 years?  Thank you very much for your help!  P.S.: oh, a friend of mine told me that my question could lack of useful information, such as the current distance of each of those stars from the Solar System, so here there are:   Current distance from Epsilon Eridani to Solar System: 10.5ly Current distance from Luyten 726-8 to Solar System: 8.7ly Other info about Epsilon Eridani: declination 9.46° south of the celestial equator (no idea if this can help) | Right Ascension 03h 32m 55.84496s | Radial velocity +15.5 ± 0.9 km/s Other info about Luyten 726-8: declination –17° 57′ 01.8″ | Right Ascension      01h 39m 01.54s | Radial velocity +29.0 km/s   [EDIT]  As suggested in the comments, I added the Right Ascension and Radial Velocity for those two stars and I'm looking for the ""Velocity vectors"" (even if I have no idea what this means)  [EDIT 2] Added links to the Extended Hipparcos Compilation (XHIP) Epsilon Eridani and Luyten 726-8AB pages with all sort of info I don't understand, but there are things such as ""Heliocentric Velocity"" on 3 axis, maybe it can help.

1380,Are black holes different sizes thanks to the different sized stars that created them?,"If the point in space that belongs to the collapsed star (that formed the black hole) is infinitely dense, why are black holes different sizes? Is it due to them feeding on stars and everything else that they swallow? "
1381,Question about total absolute magnitudes of galaxies - negative or not?,"I have seen this in a couple of places, but when the authors in the paper - [website]wrote:     ""All 10 of our ellipticals with total absolute magnitudes M_VT ≤ −21.66 have cuspy cores – “missing light” – at small radii. Cores are well known and naturally scoured by binary black holes formed in dissipationless (“dry”) mergers. All 17 ellipticals with −21.54 ≤ M_VT ≤ −15.53 do not have cores.""   Since absolute magnitude is the magnitude of that object at 10 pc away from Earth, then this is why the galaxies have such negative (meaning, very bright) values for total absolute magnitude, correct?  However, in this paper - [website]  ""The morphological properties of galaxies between 21 mag &lt; I &lt; 25 mag in the Hubble Deep Field are investigated using a quantitative classification system based on mea- surements of the central concentration and asymmetry of galaxian light.""   The galaxies here are between 21 to 25 absolute magnitudes (?) in the infrared (I?) band, but why are these magnitudes not negative?  "
1382,Galaxy discovered lacking Dark Matter,"Recently a Galaxy was discovered that contained no Dark Matter. I was wondering what explanation could be offered for this ? This Galaxy also contains only 1% as many Stars as our Milky Way does . Is there be a connection between these two things, lack of many Stars and lack of Dark Matter ? "
1383,Is there a mechanism that makes small moons more rounded than comets?,"67P/Churyumov–Gerasimenko has a highly irregular dumbbell shape. But the sample of comet shapes observed is very small, so I wonder if irregular shape is the norm for comets and for small moons. Many known moons are no larger than this ~4 km diameter comet. The smallest moons imaged are modestly irregular, basically just elongated, at least they don't have a waist like 67/P. The most elongated moon is perhaps ~135/60 km Prometheus.  Is there reason to believe that moons which are too small for hydrostatic equilibrium get more rounded than comets of similar mass and composition? Moons differ from comets in several ways. AFAIK: Moons in general have a very different gravitational environment, a much more stable distance to the Sun, experience more frequent impacts, another formation history if not captured. Composition and density depends on the formation distance from the Sun, although even ~300 km Hyperion has a similar density as 67/P.  Should we expect the small moons in general, and the moons of Pluto especially, to be rounded or dumbbell shaped? If 67P is a merged binary, isn't it more likely for two objects to merge if they are moons instead of comets, since neighboring moons have low relative speed? ~100-200 km Janus and Epimetheus look as if they could merge fairly calmly. Does the lack of (observed) dumbbell shaped moons tell us something about 67P, that its shape is a rare outlier for example? "
1384,"Why does the Earth's orbital eccentricity oscillate with a period of about 100,000 years?","This answer says:     Earth's orbital eccentricity varies over time from being nearly circular (low eccentricity of 0.0034) and mildly elliptical (high eccentricity of 0.058). It takes roughly 100,000 years for Earth to undergo a full cycle.   Why does the Earth's orbital eccentricity oscillate with a period of about 100,000 years? What would be the simplest set of conditions and/or fewest body system that would lead to this particular type of periodic variation in eccentricity? "

Why does this rumour that it never happened persist even today ? 
1386,Why was this asteroid (4864 Nimoy) chosen to be named after Leonard Nimoy?,"The asteroid 4864 Nimoy was recently named after Leonard Nimoy. It was discovered on September 2, 1988 so it went nearly 27 years without a name. Why was this asteroid chosen to be named after him? Were they trying to think of a name for it and chose to name it for Leonard Nimoy, or were they looking for an asteroid to name after him and chose that one? "
1387,Calculating the Diameter of Jupiter through Image,"I was trying to calculate the diameter of Jupiter from a picture I took of it. Here's the information I was able to get that I needed to calculate the diameter:     Focal Length of Telescope: 1.2 m      Multiplier for Barlow Lens: 2x      Camera CCD (Sensor) dimensions: 14.8 x 22.2 (mm)   I found the diameter to be 135 pixels in my image. Here's what I did:  \begin{align} f_e &amp;= \text{Focal Length [tex] Barlow Multiplier}\\  &amp;= 1.2 \cdot 2\\  &amp;= 2.4 \end{align}  Then, to calculate the field of view:  [tex]  Where the sensor size is the length in millimetres of the size of the camera CCD (I used the horizontal axis, or the longer side, to get the 135 pixels, meaning that I'd use 22.2 mm), and the second fraction is there solely to convert radians into degrees. Substituting my values, I got:  \begin{align} \text{Field of View} &amp;= \frac{0.0222}{2.4} \cdot \frac{180}{\pi}\\ &amp;= 0.53^\circ  \end{align}  As my entire image is 4271.8 pixels wide, and I know the angular field of view, I used ratios to get the field of view of the 135-pixelled Jupiter to be [tex].  Then, using basic trigonometry, I was able to calculate the radius of jupiter:  [tex]  The photo was taken on March 22, 2016 - Wolfram Alpha gives 667.6 million as the distance to Jupiter on that day:  [tex]  [tex]  Googling the radius of Jupiter gives [tex] as the result. Is there any reason why my value is so significantly off? Anything wrong with my procedure, anything I'm missing? I was not able to to upload this image I took as the file size was too large, however, the image does not lack clarity and I am completely stumped as to why my result is off by such a significant amount.   Any help will be greatly appreciated, thanks in advance. "
1388,Redshift to calculate age of stars,"In multiple articles I have seen the age of a star, within the milky way, referred to as its redshift (typically denoted by [tex]). I know that [tex] can be calculated as [tex] but what I can't find is how this is then used to calculate the age of a star within our galaxy? What characteristic does the redshift show us (spin, velocity, temperature, etc.) and how is this used mathematically to calculate age? Or is it just a method to determine where it falls on the HR diagram? "
1389,Calculate the true diameter of stars from photographic plate,"I am reading the book ""Fourier Analysis"" from T. W. Körner, and in chapter 95, he explains how you can compute the diameter of stars on a photographic plate. He says that ""Since observations of the nearest stars at six-monthly intervals (i.e. using a diameter of the earth's orbit as a surveyor's base line) enable astronomers to measure the distance of these stars, knowledge of the apparent diameter (i.e. the diameters of the discs on the photographic plate) would then enable us to calculate the true diameters of the nearest stars"".   So how do you calculate the true diameter of a star given its apparent diameter on a photographic plate? Is it related to the ""zooming capacity"" of the telescope one uses?  And if for instance, using a 100'' telescope, you measure that a star has an apparent diameter of 0.66mm, can you directly compute the true diameter of the star? "
1390,What is the force of a CME on objects in space?,"I've been reading a little bit about coronal mass ejections lately and they seem really interesting, and they cause a lot of amazing things to happen. However, one thing I haven't seen is the physical force they can have on objects. CMEs seem to have a lot of mass and they're moving at a high rate of speed so I imagine they must have some effect on objects in space, right? What kind of effect can they have on smaller objects like meteoroids, comets, or satellites (as far as orbit, rotation, anything else)? "
1391,What was the orbit of the meteor that impacted the Moon on 2013 September 11?,"On 2013 September 11th, a meteor impacted the Moon leaving a 34-meter crater. So far the only info I've found was from youtube ([website]I'm surprised this doesn't have its own wikipedia article (none that I could find, anyway), and google wasn't helpful either. Is the astronomical world more or less oblivious to this event?  Anyway, the data I'm most interested in is the meteor's orbital trajectory. And also, why would such a small meteor leave a ""fireball"" for 8 seconds according to the youtube video. "
1392,How do we not know what's in the Solar System?,"It seems every once in a while there's a claim of a new planet in the Solar System.  I don't understand how local planets can stay undiscovered for this long when astronomers are accomplishing what seem to be far more difficult feats.  For example, it's been a whole century since they had accurate enough measurements to tell that Mercury was precessing in a way that didn't jive with Newtonian mechanics. Now, if there are Earth-sized planets out there, shouldn't their presence have a pretty sizable effect on the orbits of bodies such as Neptune and Pluto? How can there be such large planets with no measurable effects until 2017 technology came along? "
1393,If a rocky world is large enough (not a gas or ice giant) can it have helium from the primordial disk in its atmosphere?,"When planets are formed do only gas and ice giants accrete hydrogen and helium? Does this accretion have to be beyond the ""snow line""?  In other words, would all hydrogen or helium in the atmosphere of a super-earth come from outgassing (radioactive decay, etc)? "
1394,Likelihood of extra planets in systems identified by Kepler?,"Kepler has found some systems with multiple planets and shown that it's likely that 7% of sun-like stars have Earth-like planets (video).  I don't think we know enough about extra solar planets to know how planetary systems are organized on average, but the multiple-planet systems are few and would be ones where the orbits of the planets are close to the star and/or flat.  In our own solar system for instance in the small strip of the sky where an observer could see the Earth transit, there are only two small sections where they could also see Venus transit, and if they did happen to see both the Earth and Venus, they would not be able to see any of our other planets transit (up to Saturn at least).    I wrote a small program to show roughly the visible area of sky where each planet could be seen to transit.  Shown is 4 degrees above or below the ecliptic:    Is there just not enough known about the variability of inclinations in orbits of planets in general to speculate about what percent of confirmed candidate planets might have siblings with different inclinations that we cannot see?  If other planetary systems had varying inclinations in their orbits like ours, it looks like for every 'Earth' they found, any other planets would only have about a 7% chance of also being visible.  Is there any reason to think that other systems with multiple planets might have less or more variability in the inclinations of the orbits of their planets? "
1395,"Origin of terms ""white dwarfs"" and ""red giants""?","Can someone explain my why ""white dwarfs"" and ""red giants"" were so named? And maybe that's a silly question but why not in the opposite way?  @EDIT Is this somehow co-related with Stefan–Boltzmann law? "
1396,How harmful is Saturn's magnetic field for human life?,"AFAIK, Jupiter has the strongest magnetic field in the solar system, and it's so powerful that I've been told humans only could survive the radiation generated by it in its mooon Callisto, with proper protection.   But how about Saturn? Saturn has the second strongest magnetic field in the solar system. Which moons of Saturn could men survive from the radiation generated by the planet's magnetic field in? "
1397,Does Sun have a reflection on Earth?,"The new Google Maps1 presents an actual view of Earth, with the current position of Sun illuminating half part of Earth in real time. It is quite an exquisite view.  My question is based on the following image:    As you can see, Sun's reflection from southern Atlantic Ocean looks very charming. But does it really happen like that? If we travel far2 from Earth, can we actually see Sun's reflection or it is just something Google added for aesthetics?    1: Yes, I don't like most of its new features too, especially when they broke several of the old ones. But that's a separate discussion.  2: Although, the camera's supposed position would be close to geostationary orbit, I guess the reflection can also been seen as close as ISS or Hubble. "
1398,What is equation of straight line for a ideal blackbody on the color color diagram?,"The color-color diagram is a plot between [tex] vs [tex] values.   For a ideal blackbody, what is the equation of this line?  In other words, what does the linear relation between [tex] and [tex] look like? "
1399,How was the Sun formed?,"Refer to the below minutephysics video, in which they say that in order to reach the Sun from earth, we must first stop revolving around the Sun ie make our tangential velocity zero, and then head straight for the sun, otherwise it is nearly impossible to reach the sun because even a very huge push towards the sun will either send us in an elliptical or hyperbolic orbit:-    [website]If even a little bit of orbital speed tangentially, prevents something from falling into the sun, then I wonder how does the sun formed itself at the beginning? Because, most collapsing material probably would be having at least some tangential velocity with respect to the center. "
1400,How can I use Polar Alignment to find objects in the sky?,"I have a six inch telescope on an equatorial mount and I've been struggling to use the mount properly. For a couple months now, the only strategy I've used is just 'point and look.' I've watched some youtube videos on polar aligning a telescope, but none of the videos ever tell me how I can use polar alignment to find other objects after I've aligned. Is polar alignment even the right method of finding objects? If so, how can I use the degrees and minutes on my RA and DEC knobs to point directly at an object? "
1401,Photometer vs. CCD-camera,"The Wikipedia article on photometry says that      These have largely been replaced with CCD cameras that can simultaneously image multiple objects, although photoelectric photometers are still used in special situations, such as where fine time resolution is required.   How much the research community is using photometers today? I looked up the prices of some photometers from here. The device, filters, etc. can cost nearly $2500. One could get a good CCD camera with that price.  What are some applications where the good time resolution (apparently around 1 ms) would be needed? Are photometers equally useful with small telescopes (e.g. 8-inch) as CCDs? "
1402,Do we have to take gravitational lensing into consideration when measuring the size of exoplanets?,For the method of waiting for a planet to pass in front of a star. rather than just measuring the light that is blocked do we also have to take into consideration the light that may not be coming to us because of gravitational lensing caused by the planet? Is the mass of a planet large enough to cause gravitational lensing significant enough for us to see an effect? 
1403,How can we explain high redshift numbers?,"I just finished an introductory astrophysics course[tex] and I have a lingering question that I can't seem to resolve.  We learned that for the first few hundred million years, the universe was pretty boring and not much interesting[tex] happened. We also learned, correctly or not, that the first stars started forming somewhere between 500 million and 600  million years after the Big Bang.  We also learned how to use redshift values to calculate age, and we talked about how the highest [tex]-number we've discovered is some galaxy (GN-z11) at roughly [tex].  Using this calculator, we calcultaed that this galaxy apparently formed about 410 million years after the Big Bang.  So, this galaxy seems to be older than when astrophysicists think star formation happened. How can this possibly be? Clearly one of my assumptions is wrong, so is it:   Stars actually started forming before 500 million years post-Big Bang. Using the UCLA calculator to calculate age is technically incorrect. A galaxy doesn't need stars to be considered a galaxy. Some other assumption I made is wrong which makes this post invalid.   As a follow-up question, what happens if we keep finding galaxies at higher [tex]-numbers? At what point do we need to reconsider our theory about what happened in the ""early"" universe?    [tex]I'm not an astrophysics major, so forgive any blatant falsehoods in this post.  [tex]On a macro-scale, at least. "

1405,Does the universe prefer a velocity?,"As I understand it, the distribution of matter is roughly homogeneous across space -- anywhere I stand in the universe, there will about the same amount of matter in every direction around me.  Is the distribution of matter across velocities roughly homogeneous?  If I flew away from the center of the Milky Way at .999c, would all directions look roughly the same, or would I notice a wind of galaxies and neutrinos traveling at a preferred velocity?  Tags I cannot add: cosmological principle, homogeneity, isotropy "
1406,Isn't the date of the Big Bang a bit bogus?,"If I understand correctly, the date of the Big Bang is an extrapolation of acceleration of the universe's expansion through time based on the erroneous assumption that the universe is approximately 13 billion years old. The age of the universe, as far as I can tell is based on the speed of light and the fact that the furthest we could possibly see into the depths of the universe is approximately 13 billion light-years. Isn't that sort of a cat chasing his tail?  It seems that there is no valid reason for believing that the universe is really of a radius of ~13 billion years. That is just as far as we can see. If this is wrong and there is a valid reason for believing that the universe is ~ 13 billion years old, then that fact makes for a very interesting possibility.  That the expansion rate of the universe is equal to the speed of light, which leads to a very interesting suggestion that I pursued for quite awhile (until it became apparent that the suggested size of the universe is not what it seems), that the expansion rate of the universe is equal to the speed of light. Or, put another way, is it possible that the speed of light is based on the expansion rate of the universe? "
1407,absorption line from the chromosphere,"If I understand correctly, the H-alpha and Ca II K lines are absorption lines of the sun and allow to see the chromosphere.

However the chromosphere is hotter than the photosphere and the temperature increases outward ([website]thank you in advance for your help. "
1408,"Angular diameter of the Sun's reflection from the ocean, seen from Sun-Earth L1?","I'm trying to understand how smooth the reflecting ocean surface would need to be to produce such a small bright spot as seen from the DSCOVR satellite at Sun-Earth L1. It appears to be only about 8E-05 rad, or about 0.3 arcminutes.   My question is primarily about the geometrical optics involved in the reflection of light from the Sun off of the Earth. Interpretation of the apparent size and comparing to the image is secondary.  At a distance of 151.3 million km from Earth, the 1.391 million km diameter Sun has an angular width of 0.009196 radians. The DSCOVR satellite is 1.586 million km from the Earth looking at the Sun's reflection from somewhere around the Sun-Earth L1 point. It's close to the Earth-Sun axis (the Sun-Earth-DSCOVR angle is about 7.6 degrees) so let's simplify and assume it sits on-axis.  The Earth's radius is 6378 km; as a convex mirror its focal length is [tex] or -3189 km.   Question: What would be the angular size of the Sun seen from DSCOVR reflecting in a spherical mirror model for the Earth in this configuration?    What I'm looking at (for context):  This sequence of images taken by the EPIC camera on the DSCOVR satellite near the Sun-Earth L1 point is notable for showing the progress of the Moon's shadow across the Earth, but that's not the topic of my question.  The first image shows the back-reflection of the Sun from the Earth. It is likely to be from a particularly calm spot on the Ocean, but that's not for sure, there are some images that show reflections from horizontally oriented ice crystals as well. See Are there measurements or calculations that suggest atmospheric ice plates would be horizontal to within 0.1 degrees? and also How could the recently explained “glints” seen by DSCOVR appear so compact considering the finite size of the sun? for some interesting images and more on that.   But that doesn't matter for the purposes of my question.  Width of Earth 6378 km x 2 / 1586000 km = 8.0428E-03 rad corresponds to ~1500 pixels.   Bright spot is about 15 pixels wide, or about 8E-05 rad.  Could such a small angular width be a geometrical reflection of the Sun from a very smooth ocean?  Raw image at NASA seen here.     "

1410,How old is the oldest light visible from Earth?,"Because light can only travel so fast, all of the light we see in the sky was emitted at a previous moment in time.  So if for example we see a supernova or some other great stellar event, by the time we see it, it maybe long over.  That made me kind of curious, what is the most ancient light we can see from earth?    The universe is supposedly ~13+ billion years old, but we are probably not at the very edge of the known universe so all the light we see is probably less than 13 billion years old.  So what is the oldest light we can see? and as an optional follow-up question how do we know the age of that light?   I guess the light itself may not actually be literally 'old', but its probably obvious what I'm asking here, put another way: what's the longest distance that now earth visible light emitted has traveled to reach the earth?  Though that reformation of the question gets kind of tangled with lensing effects. "
1411,I'm having trouble achieving sharp telescope focus,"I've been having trouble getting really sharp focus on my telescope. Using Saturn as a reference, with a 20mm eye piece it is very sharp. But when I go to 10mm or 6mm, it gets bigger and blurrier. I re-adjust focus each time I change eye pieces, but the best I can get at the stronger magnifications is still very blurry compared to 20mm. The 20mm will have nice sharp edges on the planet and rings, whereas 10mm and 6mm have fuzzy edges on the rings, and the planet itself.  I'm using the Celestron NexStar Evolution 8 Schmidt-Cassegrain Telescope. I'm in a suburban area so I'm sure there is light pollution, could that be a factor?  Last night I was observing for about an hour, which I believe would be enough time for the temperature of the telescope to match the temperature outside.  I also tried combining the 20mm with a Celestron 2x Barlow lens, just with an idea that maybe it would make a difference, but it was pretty much the same.  Is there something I'm doing wrong? "

1413,Axial wobble or binary star system,"Is our solar system affected by a body unobserved as of yet that causes our solar system to curve through space in an orbit? Is this idea outlandish or us there any evidence to support it? Consider this information:      ""In 2007 Voyager 2 unexpectedly reached the edge of the heliosphere at a distance approximately 1.5 billion km less than the distance traveled by Voyager 1, indicating the SS is bullet shaped in the direction of the interstellar magnetic field.""    Another bit of information is that a binary system with a moving SS was suggested as far back in modern times as 1894 -- with predictions 40x more accurate than an earth wobble to calculate precession of equinoxes (over 100 years).   Also unknown to me was precession was observed millennia ago, for which we have some records, but today's accepted notion was formed in the 1850's -- before it was accepted that the solar system even moved. Our current theory of precession takes no account for SS movement. Zero.   Lasly local bodies do not precess at all, only distant stars and -- from what I understand -- all of them.    Is a binary star system just bunk? Can it be tested for?  Is the axial wobble theory tried tested and come up true every time or Does this theory have predictability issues that have to be tweeked constantly?  Why is it that the moons orbit around the earth, as well as the earths orbit around the sun, are increasing and the precessional cycle is speeding up? Shouldn't that have the opposite effect?  "

Then   $$\theta = 1.22\cdot\frac{\lambda}{D} \text{ rad} = 1.22\cdot\frac{550 \text{ nm}}{20\text{ cm}} \text{ rad} = 1.22\cdot\frac{5.5\cdot10^{-5}\text{ cm}}{20\text{ cm}}\cdot 206264.8'' \approx 0.69'' $$  In other words, the angular resolution of the telescope is [tex] seconds of arc for [tex] nm.  Now, is it really so that the eye-piece of the telescope has no play in this at all? Wikipedia says that     and D is the diameter of the lens' aperture.   which I would understand to be taken as the size of the primary mirror alone in a Newtonian telescope.  So if there is for example a double (binary) star, I will see them as one no matter what kind of magnification/eye-piece I am using if the angle between the stars (from my point of view) is less than [tex]? And vice versa, if the angle between the stars is greater than [tex] I will see them as separate stars with any eye-piece or magnification?  (In theory, I know there's a lot of limitations from optics, seeing, etc.) "
1418,Photographing Venus with a phone through a telescope,"  I took a picture of Venus through my telescope (Celestron Astromaster 130eq) using a 10mm lens with a Barlow lens.  The picture isn't really good since I took it with my phone and I still don't have a camera.   Also, it isn't a matter of focus since I fiddled a lot with it.  I don't know what to do to clear the image and reduce the brightness. Should I use a filter? and which one?  "
1419,How can white dwarf form Oxygen ? (Temperature problem),"I’ve got a question about white dwarfs and oxygen.  I read in a book that a temperature of 100 million degrees is required to fuse Helium in the core of a red giant. The Helium fuses into Carbon by the triple-alpha process.   It’s also written that, after a temperature of 350 million degrees is reached, the core of a red giant ceases to be degenerate. So, the core is able to expand and its temperature is controlled. The core won't reach a temperature of more than 350 million.  But my teacher has said that a temperature of 600 million degrees is needed to form Oxygen from Carbon: Carbon fuses into Neon and by photodisintegration gives Oxygen.   So, how can there be Oxygen in white dwarfs, if we don't reach a temperature higher than 350 million degrees? By what process can oxygen be formed in a red giant?  "
1420,Why do we continue to find a discrepancy in the Hubble Constant?,"After taking a look at some recent papers (examples below) that attempt to derive the value of the Hubble Constant, they all conclude with dramatically different values (speaking in context). Why is this? Each of the techniques seems sufficiently rigorous and equally well rooted in understood physics. Is this simply some form of error or is it due to some yet-to-be-discovered physics?  Papers:   A gravitational-wave standard siren measurement of the Hubble constant, H0 = 70 Planck 2015 Results, H0 = 67.8 New Parallaxes of Galactic Cepheids from Spatially Scanning theHubbleSpaceTelescope: Implications for the Hubble Constant, H0 = 73.48   I do understand that this is a hot topic right now in cosmology, however I just don't yet understand why we're having trouble with getting our measured values of the Hubble Constant to converge. "
1421,What happens if a black hole is produced inside another black hole?,"Similar question here.  The question I linked got me thinking.   It is known that a black hole doesn't let anything escape its event horizon, not even light. Thus, naturally, anything that passes the event horizon would get ""eaten"".   Now, assume a supermassive black hole(small Roche limit, large event horizon) was in the path of a high eccentricity, massive, dying star. Assume the star is travelling in a straight line at 5% the speed of light, and the black hole is stationary. The star would be swallowed by the black hole, and also swallowed intact. Now, the star goes supernova inside the black hole, but since its mass is very high, it too, creates a black hole. What would happen?  Would the supermassive black hole gain the mass of the star and things would go as normal for an outside viewer(everyday common things: black hole swallowing objects)? Would the black hole inside the larger one pull the larger one in? Or something else?  Thanks!  Max0815 "
1422,What is the solar system orientation to its direction of travel?,I saw the picture and seem incorrectly drawn. Its shows the the edge of the solar system leading facing the Heliosheath. It would not be like NASA to post something as incorrect as this. The solar system should at 60 degrees to the direction of travel? I'm not sure maybe this picture is correct? [website]
1423,Trouble understanding speed-dispersion in (elliptical) galaxies,"I'm learning about LOSVDs (Line Of Sight Velocity Distributions) and I'm having a bit of trouble understanding the used terms.  As I understand, the LOSVD of a given (elliptical) galaxy is the density distribution of the LOS-velocities. The full LOSVD is difficult to find and it's easier to find 2 parameters of the distribution: [tex] and [tex] by fitting a (Gaussian) model to the spectrum of the galaxy.  I have a limited understanding of statistics, so I'm having trouble intuitively understanding what these 2 parameters mean later on.    I think that [tex] is simply the average value of the LOS-velocity for the whole galaxy while [tex] is the equivalent of a standard deviation.  Now later on in my coursebook, there's an explanation of how to get a LOSVDs for every point (/pixel) in the (projection onto the celestial sphere of the) galaxy by using 3D spectrography. From this we can get a 3D dynamic model from our 2D kinematic model. In this newly found 3D distribution there's also 3 Sigmas, one for every dimension.  But here comes the part I don't understand: The book is looking at the movement of stars in a spiral galaxy, the Milky way in particular.  We're trying to find a correlation between the age of MS-stars and their dispersion and so there's a dataset of a few stars in the neighbourhood of the sun with their dispersion in every dimension.  What is the meaning of dispersion in this context? How can a single object have a dispersion if it's a parameter of a density distribution? "
1424,"What is meant by ""there is no refraction at the zenith""?","Wikipedia states:     Atmospheric refraction of the light from a star is zero in the zenith   and other sources seem to agree.  I don't see why this should be so. Consider a situation in which air gets warmer from left to right. Then light should curve towards the warm air, and a star at the zenith would appear refracted.    So why do so many sources claim there is no refraction at the zenith? What do they mean by this? "
1425,Difference in energy released in stellar mass black hole merger and supermassive black hole merger,Super massive black holes are usually millions of times more massive than stellar mass black holes. I have read on SE and over internet that 3M☉ worth of energy is released in black hole mergers (not sure which type of merger). I have tow related questions:   What is the difference in energy released from a stellar mass black hole merger vs. a supermassive black hole merger?   How much energy will be released in the super massive black hole merger when Milky way and Andromeda will merge in few billion years?    
1426,Does Jupiter lose some atmosphere at all?,"I've hear of something like this: ""All planets lose their atmospheres eventually and they become a barren rock if given enough time.""  There are three types of atmospheric loss ways:   Jeans Escape: Temperature and escape velocity factors determine the gasses and the amount that's lost. Jupiter cannot lose atmosphere via Jeans escape because Jupiter has too high escape velocity and too high of a temperature. Charge exchange: Solar radiation creates electrons and positively charged ions in upper atmospheres by tearing electrons off atoms or molecules. Subsequently, charge attraction and repulsion in collisions accelerates ions. Jupiter most likely cannot lose its atmosphere via charge exchange because its magnetic field is strong and extensive while no(little?) material escapes via polar wind. Vertical atmospheric escape/impact erosion: Energetic objects that strike a planet erodes its atmosphere by creating a plume of heated gas. Jupiter does not lose its atmosphere via impact erosion because it has very high gravity and escape velocity. This pulls particles ejected by impact back into its atmosphere.   Since Jupiter doesn't lose atmosphere in the three types of atmospheric loss, how does it lose its atmosphere? "
1427,An hypothetical timepiece on board of a spaceship. Please Help,"On board of a hypothetical spaceship, I have a hypothetical clock consisting of 2 mirrors and a light beam is being reflected between the mirrors to measure the time. Now if we hypothetically exceed the speed of light; what will I see is happening to my clock on board of my ship? (a) Light can't exceed the speed of light so according to me the clock has freezed, (b) Light always passes the observer at the speed of light, so my clock is keeping perfectly time but the speed of light inside my clock has surpassed the speed of light? (c) The clock will run backwards?  I just can't wrap my mind around this problem. "
1428,"A ""strange"" unit radio astronomy","I'm reading up on radio astronomy, and I came across this paper from 1964. At the bottom of page 193, the author uses a unit that I've not seen before in discussing radio power emission from stars:     Now the outbursts on the Sun give an intensity on Earth of [tex] to [tex] [tex]   I'm guessing it's ""Watts per square meter per [something] per second"", but I'm not sure what the [something] is.  A similar unit appears in this paper on the first line on page 364:     The comparison band in the radiometer, being separated approximately 3.25 Mc from the signal band, never encounters the hydrogen range of frequencies.   Again, this looks to me like mega[something]. Can anyone shed some light on this?  On page 362 of the second paper, the unit appears as $(Watts/M^2 )/(C/S)[tex]C[tex]3.25 Mc$ in the second quote seem weird. "
1429,Is it accurate to compare comets to clouds and rain?,"I'm trying to avoid an opinion-based question, so before I outline the comparison I'm proposing, I will qualify the specific facts that yield this comparison. By focusing answers on the relative accuracy of those facts, hopefully we can avoid primarily opinion-based answers.  Facts   Over the course of millions of years, planetary bodies, especially those closer to the sun, tend to lose their water and atmosphere as it is blown away by solar wind, and radiated or boiled off by other forces, unless they have a strong magnetosphere to repel the bulk of that solar wind, or enough gravity to hang on to their matter. On a much faster time scale, this also happens to comets as they approach the sun; thus, the tail. Over the course of millions of years, bombardment of planets by comets can increase the water and gas on a planet, or at least counter-balance the gradual loss of the same (depending on other factors like proximity to the sun, size, and magnetic protection). The Oort cloud is composed mostly of icy bodies (including solids that would be a gas at Earth temperatures). And it is from this region that comets ""fall"" toward the inner solar system.   Also Fact? So I started wondering what ultimately happens to the water and gas that gets blown off of planetary bodies. I would guess that given the outward pressure of solar wind and solar radiation, the direction of such material is generally outward, away from the sun. Well, where to? Media coverage of the departure of Voyager 1 from our solar system into the realm of interstellar space alerted me to the idea that there is an outer edge to solar influence, and I would guess that this is where the lighter molecules, like water and gases would tend to land. And indeed there is a collection of similar material out there at that solar radius.  Given these facts, is it accurate to view the Oort cloud as behaving similarly to a terrestrial cloudscape? Our clouds form at the altitude where water tends to deposit after it evaporates from the heated surface of the Earth. It gathers there and coalesces to a form which is then overcome by the opposing force of gravity. Then it returns from whence it came. Similarly, I imagine water and gases ultimately being driven from the heat of the sun to an “altitude above its surface”, where ultimately, over a much longer time scale, that material coalesces until other forces eventually drive them back toward the hot sun. Is this an accurate understanding? Is this comparison justified? "
1430,Is the Dwarf Planet class really necessary?,"Another way of asking this is, what is the difference between dwarf planets and asteroids? Aren't they the same things? It's just that some asteroids are spherical and others aren't...or is there something else?  I can understand why Pluto was demoted. Same thing happened to Ceres (after 50 years of being called a planet?) when we found out it was in an asteroid belt. It would be more helpful to laymen, I think, if the Kuiper Belt was renamed to the Second Asteroid Belt or maybe the Icy Asteroid Belt.  But why not stick to the original classes where we only had planet and asteroid? (and moon i guess.) Why add a new class called dwarf planets? Was it just to temper the protests?  EDIT: I forgot to add, we never needed a dwarf planet class before, despite knowing that Ceres was spherical for a long time. So where has this need, if it really exists, come from? "
1431,Can Earth be ejected out of the solar system this way?,I found this image of what maybe a model of our solar system. Without a credible source I'm not sure I am looking at a star or black hole that comes close to our solar system and how it could throw Earth out of orbit from the sun and/or solar system?    I found it while Googling for how a solar system travels through space and did a picture search with no luck.  Is this possible? And what am I looking at?   
1432,"Other than relative temperatures, is there any difference between a red sun and a yellow sun?","As time goes by, explanations for unusual things that exist in fiction get disproven. We know radiation probably isn't going to create a Giant ant that destroys everything, we're pretty sure we can't use ray guns, and the idea that falling into a black hole would put you face to face with Ming the Merciless is laughable.  Comic nerds might have guessed from the title why I'm asking, but I'm curious if there could still be any reason to latch on to to explain why superman is powered by a yellow sun, but not a red one? Does the higher temperature of a yellow sun create a higher level of some concentration of exotic particles, or once you get to the point of [solar fusion] is the output pretty much exactly the same?  Note: This question is not about superman, or his powers, just if there is any (temperature aside) meaningful difference between a yellow and red sun (that could be conveniently used by DC to still justify superman's powers). "
1433,Are there any unmanned large telescopes located on Earth?,"I just read the answers to the question ""Why are all space observatories in Chile?"".  In addition to the reasons provided, one of the answers also mentions that     ...if the telescope should be manned by humans permanently, it cannot   be located to high due to the difficulty for humans to function at   extremely high altitudes, ...   Which leads to my question:     Are there any unmanned large telescopes located on Earth?   I realize that, even if large telescopes are unmanned, they probably need to be serviced by humans on a regular basis. But are humans needed permanently on site?   I also realize that, even though there are humans monitoring the measurements from space telescopes, space telescopes are unmanned in the sense that there are no people at the space telescopes manning them. "
1434,calculating lunar phases,"Given a date, I'd like to return the lunar phase.  Jean Meeus's Astronomical Algorithms book and the many packages like PyEphem that make use its algorithms provide ways to calculate when a primary phase (New, First Quarter, Full, and Last Quarter).  The secondary phases (Waxing Crescent, First Quarter, Waxing Gibbous, Waning Gibbous, and Waning Crescent) can be easily calculated as falling in between the primary ones.  The percent illuminated the moon (or any other body between the observer and the Sun) can also be calculated for a given point in time.   We can also calculate the subsolar point.  What isn't clear is how long the primary phases should be considered to be in play.  How are labels generally determined for these phases?  The next new moon occurs 2017/7/23 09:45:34 UTC.  When should it no longer be considered new but waxing crescent?     When it is 1.0% illuminated?  When the subsolar point moves 5 degrees west of 180E?  10 degrees? At 2017/7/24 00:00:01 local time? At 2017/7/24 00:00:01 UTC?   I'm inclined to use the last.  The moon is ""new"" for the entire UTC day 0.0% illumination falls on.  The following day it is waxing crescent and remains so until the day the first quarter falls.  Anyone know of a standard here or rule of thumb? "
1435,Is the Universe really expanding at an increasing rate?,"Here's what I just read from Wikipedia's page on the Hubble Space Telescope:     While Hubble helped to refine estimates of the age of the universe, it also cast doubt on theories about its future. Astronomers from the High-z Supernova Search Team and the Supernova Cosmology Project used ground-based telescopes and HST to observe distant supernovae and uncovered evidence that, far from decelerating under the influence of gravity, the expansion of the universe may in fact be accelerating. The cause of this acceleration remains poorly understood; the most common cause attributed is dark energy.   I don't take this at face value because we should expect more distant objects to have higher observed speeds and therefore higher observed red-shifts. Here's why.   Let's start with a model where the Universe expanded very fast early on, but has been slowing down ever since due to gravity, as one would normally expect. Remember that, the farther away a cosmic object is, the farther back in the past we are observing it. An object 1,000 light years away, if it's light is reaching us now, is being observed in its state that existed 1,000 years ago. We are effectively looking through a time machine. So if we observe a more distant object, we're observing an older state of that object. Therefore, we are observing it at a time when the Universe was expanding faster than it is now, so it has higher red-shifts.   And isn't that what we observe today? The more distant the galaxy, the higher its red-shift? This is not inconsistent with a ""normal"" model where the expansion is slowing down due to gravity.  What am I missing? Why are scientists trying to explain such things with weird dark matter and dark energy that otherwise have never been detected or found evidence of and aren't needed for any other model, and in fact get in the way of our models of physics and quantum dynamics? "
1436,An image for the unified model of AGN,"In a paper I'm writing, I've referenced an image I got from the NASA site at [website]The AGN unified model, showing the BLR and NLR, as well as different types based on the observational angle. Credit: Fermi and NASA:  [website]but my supervisor said that I should use proper referencing (I see that the image seems to be derived from this paper). The image from the NASA site is much clearer and easier to understand, and I'd much rather use it for clarity's sake.  What's the proper way to reference an image like this, which is derived from a paper?  Maybe I should just use the original image?  Or does anyone know of a better quality one from another paper, similar to the one from the NASA site?  EDIT: I should mention that this is a follow-up question to one I posted here. "
1437,"Does a planet's rotation speed and distance from its star influence the precession of its axis? And is the Earth's precession ""normal""?","I guess first off, do all/most planets with a tilted axis experience precession? And if so, is it usually in the same direction (clockwise or anticlockwise)?     What I'm really curious about is if a planet is tidally locked to its star, could it still experience precession which would in effect slowly shift the day-night line on the planet?     I'm aware that most planets tidally locked to their stars are under more extreme gravitational forces whether it be a larger star than the sun or an orbital distance much smaller than 1AU. How would these gravitational forces affect the precession?     And lastly, is there any theoretical ""limit"" to the speed of precession? I know for the Earth it takes the axis ~26,000 years to complete a full circuit. Is it typical that this process takes so much longer than for the Earth to complete a rotation or revolution or could a planet theoretically have a much shorter precession cycle and what kind of effects would such movement have on the planet itself?  And similarly, if the planet's rotation speed is much slower than the Earth due to tidal locking (let's just say ~2-3 months) would the precession eventually stop all together or not until an object stops rotating completely?   If anyone feels like being particularly helpful and doing some math that goes way over my head, perhaps you could give me a rough estimate of the speed of precession (i.e., length of time required for a complete circuit of the axis) for the following situations:   An Earth-sized, moonless planet tidally locked in the goldilocks zone of an average red dwarf; A Mars-sized, moonless planet with the same conditions.    I've also read that other factors influence the precession such as the gravitational pull of large Jupiter-like planets. Is this minimal or considerable? "
1438,Star formation around rotating black holes?,Please excuse an amateur question.  While trying to think of anything but what was happening during a dental procedure my mind turned to a model of a star close to a rotating black hole and the effects on the drawn in matter.   While it is obvious such matter would be excited to high temperature could the combination of rotation and excitation be enough to induce a sustained fusion reaction?  If so would this produce enough energy to maintain a fusion 'ring' at the event horizon - essentially a doughnut star?  Would there be enough of a reaction to start producing lighter elements?  Pure curiosity generated by an attempt to distract myself 
1439,Why are saturn rings so thin?,"I wonder why saturn rings are so thin ? Rings A, B and C are approximately just 10 meters thick which is extremely thin compared to the size of Saturn. What are the explanations for that ?  Thanks a lot in advance for your answers. "
1440,Can anyone explain this odd Galactic dust filament near the LMC?,"Perusing the Planck 353 GHz polarisation Aitoff projection I noticed an apparent magnetically driven dust filament rising abruptly from the Galactic ß-field in the Chameleon-Mensa S polar region. It streams for ~25° before dwindling in Eridanus. It appears to be associated with Galactic cirrus clumps 80 PC below the disc plane. The Planck 353 GHz image is here, and a quickie Chromoscope survey in optical, NIR, FIT mm/µm, and 21 cm is here. It is mentioned in only a few papers incl. Besla/Martinez-Delgado 2015, but there has been no specific study of its unusual morphology. It looks like a magnetically driven jet but originates from a region devoid of high-energy activity. If it is a Birkeland current it is a very odd one. I wonder if it is an old SN 1a remnant of the Hercules Loop and Aquila Rift type based on faint extinction filaments in Schlegel 1998 S Polar projection and 4 other Planck Aitoffs which seem to suggest traces of an old circular feature. Any suggestions? "
1441,Moon's orbit around the Sun,"The Earth revolves around the Sun and the Moon revolves around the Earth. Out of curiosity I started thinking about the orbit of the Moon around the Sun and expected (assumed) it to be as follows:    But on Wikipedia and some other sites I found out that the orbit is actually like this:    I have 3 questions:   What is the reason for this difference between assumed and actual path variation? Has this path been like this since the formation of the Moon? Do natural satellites of other planets also follow the same orbit around the Sun?   After further searching I found out a better, easier explanation regarding the orbit path on YouTube for those interested, be sure to check it out. "
1442,Do astronomers have any idea what percentage of our galaxy’s stars move in retrograde orbits?,"I recently noticed that none of the planets in our solar system orbit the Sun in a retrograde direction. This is likely because they formed moving in the same direction as the planetary disk did in respect to the Sun.   Are there stars that move retrograde to the Milky Way galaxy's rotation? If so, where are they concentrated, and why? "
1443,Can the moon's gravity influence be observed on the space station's orbit?,"In browsing through Astronomy Stack Exchange, I came across this question about orbiting the moon (Is it possible to achieve a stable &quot;lunarstationary&quot; orbit around the moon?).  In further looking, I came across (Can I measure the moon&#39;s gravity?) which seems to indicate that with sensitive enough equipment, the moon's gravitational pull could be measured on earth.  This prompted me to wonder if the moon's gravitational pull can be observed on the Space Station's or geosynchronous satellite's orbital path?  And if so, if any compensation (either short-term or long-term) needs to be performed due to the moon's gravity.  I would think it to be relatively inconsequential, but am not sure, hence the question. "
1444,Is hubble constant dependent on redshift?,"I know there are lot of questions on hubble constant already, but I am curious to know if it changes with redshift?

1445,Last possible total solar elipse in the Earth's history,"So the Moon is drifting away from Earth by 3.8 cm a year due to tidal interactions. With the Moon slowly receding from Earth, there will come a time when it no longer has sufficient angular size to cover the Sun completely. When will the last total solar eclipse occur?(when will the Moon's umbra no longer be able to project onto the Earth?) "
1446,Astrophotography: Is there a rule to the color mapping?,"As I understand it most astrophotography is colored using filters and multiple exposures. I would assume that blue filters would be used for higher frequency emissions and red filters for lower frequency emissions, as it at least keeps the ""order"" of information intact. But besides that, is there any rule or hints to go by when looking at colored astrophotography and deducing the depicted wavelengths? Because a fairly common problem would be, I assume, when something is only visible in either infrared or ultraviolet. How would I differentiate that? Do I just have to know what emission bands certain phenomena are visible in? "
1447,Scenarios: Abusing a black hole,"So a black hole is this large, sphere-blob shaped fluid thing that distorts space and time, making a weird hole in space(even after 5 years, I still don't exactly get what a black hole is exactly and where the mass goes when it eats xD).   So, let's say, we make a huge antimatter(opposite charge, same mass as matter) star and send it into the black hole. What would happen? The antimatter would annihilate with the matter made black hole, or is it wrong to assume a black hole is made of matter?(I assume not much would happen if the antimatter can't react with the matter, because the black hole would probably get its original charge messed up.)  What about if we created a huge exotic matter(same charge, opposite mass) star and sent it into a black hole? Would the repulsive force successfully destroy a black hole? According to Kurzgesagt and several articles cited by them, exotic matter is able to keep a wormhole stable, so wouldn't it be able to annihilate the black hole or something? Or have I made a misunderstanding? "
1448,"What makes a really good observatory site, besides altitude?","Let's limit this to optical telescopes.  I understand that the higher you are, the less atmosphere is above you to get in the way of observations. From reading around, there seem to be a few more but I'm not sure:   Not near an active or dormant volcano (but Mauna Kea seems to disprove this?). This is kinda a bummer because a lot of tall mountains seem to be volcanic. Somewhere with clear and/or dry weather for as much of the year as possible Not near major light pollution like cities Cold weather is better than hot weather? Not sure I understand that; if it's uniformly hot or cold then I don't see how it makes a difference.   Am I missing any? Or are these wrong in some way?  As a concrete example, would the Tibetian plateau make a really good observatory site? (Not considering construction or transportation costs to a remote area, of course.) "
1449,How would the Tycho Impact have appeared from Earth?,"The Tycho crater is thought to be the youngest major impact on the Moon, estimated at 108 million years ago. This puts it firmly in the reign of the dinosaurs, I find myself curious as to what our thunder-lizard brethren would have witnessed.    Roughly how bright would the initial flash have been? Would a glowing scar have been left on the Moon for days, weeks or months? Would the Earth have been subject to spectacular global meteor showers from ejected debris? Would any other effects have been felt on Earth? I'd guess that a simulation would be required to accurately answer these questions but I'm hoping that some reasonable estimates can be made by comparison of studies of other impacts.  Finally, was the Tycho impact of greater or smaller magnitude than the Shoemaker–Levy 9 impact in 1994? "
1450,Accelerating universe expansion and standard candle,"Recent stars (and standard candle supernova), afaik, contain more heavy elements than older stars. As consequence, I guess, recent stars and supernova should be slightly dimmer than older stars? If previous sentence is true, slightly dimmer Ia supernova will appear as if it is more distant leading to the conclusion that universe is expanding faster. Does measuring of universe expansion rate and ""dark energy"" takes such possibility in to the computation? "
1451,Why does star formation cease?,"The universe is expected to have a time when star formation slowly ceases. However, this seems bizarre as there is always an abundant amount of matter in the Universe. Massive amounts of hydrogen exists in several galaxies, but they are deemed dead. Any gravitational disturbance can send the gas into a protostar, and even if there weren't hydrogen left, enough helium or carbon can turn a star into a star that fuses heavier elements, until the universe is depleted of such and mostly elements heavier than iron.  So why does star formation cease when these is still abundant hydrogen around? Is there some sort of interaction in these hydrogen supplies that prevents star formation? Is the gas kept at a temperature that is too hot for formation? Or have I made a misconception? "

1454,"tiny diamonds in meteorite ""signature of a long-lost planet"": why come to Earth in 2008?","ref this paper in Nature re the Almahata Sitta 2008 meteorite shower.  I get that they're saying the diamonds could only have been formed within something the size of planet, which subsequently broke apart in the ""early days"" of the Solar System.  I get that Saturn and Jupiter are so massive relative to other Solar System bodies they've marshalled fragments into the Asteroid belt, Kuiper belt, outer disk. And that they're still disturbing those regions enough to occasionally pull things into a cometary orbit/become meteors.  This putative planet must have scattered everywhere when it first broke apart/lead to comets and meteors all over the place. But why/how did this fragment wait until 2008 to come to Earth? Where's it been for billions of years? Why didn't it either crash into something a long time ago; or form itself into a stable orbit?

I learned that the resolution is fixed when the light enters the telescope, and that the eye-piece is used just for magnifying the obtained image at the focal plane.  Now, the magnification of a telescope is calculated as   $$ \text{magnification} = \frac{\text{focal length of telescope}}{\text{focal length of eye-piece}} \qquad (1) $$  For example, if the focal length of my telescope is [tex] mm and I am using a [tex] mm eye-piece, the magnification I get is   $$ \text{magnification} = \frac{900\ \text{mm}}{25\ \text{mm}} = 36. $$  However, where does the formula [tex] come from? Why is the magnification affected by the focal length of the telescope and eye piece?  (I am using a Newtonian telescope if it matters.) "
1456,Terminology for empty space at the edge of the observable universe?,"Is there a name for a point at the edge of the observable universe at which there is no visible matter, that appears completely dark?  I'm thinking something like ""empty space"", but that could equally apply to an empty void between galaxies, which isn't quite what I'm looking for.  So it would refer to a theoretical line in space from the observer to the edge of the universe which contains no visible matter. Is there a term for this? "
1457,Star formation analogy,"If I have understood correctly, stars form in big clouds of gas and dust that are pulled together by their gravity. And the stars are often ignited when something disturbs the cloud, such as a passing massive body, or a wave like the once which create spirals in galaxies.  Are there any phenomena on earth that behave like these clouds, which could be used to illustrate and explain star formation? Something people might be familiar with and which you could show a video clip of?  I'm thinking about some gas that is disturbed then takes solid form? Or something completely different which looks similar? "
1458,Smallest mass of star to be a black hole?,"It seems to me that I forgot the smallest mass of a star and its angular momentum in order to form a black hole.   So I know that electron degeneracy pressure is overcome if the core is 1.4 solar masses, and neutron degeneracy pressure is overcome if the core is 3 solar masses, but if the neutron star is spinning fast enough, it can have a maximum mass of about 4 solar masses. But then, this is just the core of the star. How large does this star have to be in order to form a black hole, and how fast would its spin need to be in order to avoid forming a blitzar?  I've looked on google and bing but to no avail.  Help is appreciated!  Thank you!  Max0815    Please stop trying to make this a duplicate.  Why: How large does this star have to be in order to form a black hole, and how fast would its spin need to be in order to avoid forming a blitzar? "
1459,Asteroseismology; recordings of star vibrations duration and data availability?,"A short video titled ""Why Tess is recording the ""sounds of stars"" at the bottom of the page of the BBC News article Planet-hunter launches from Florida gives a short description of Asteroseismology by Astronomer Bill Chaplin of the University of Birmingham.  Presumably the sounds played here are some kind of photometric measurements of stars that have been played back a few orders of magnitude faster to make them audible.  I'd like to listen to more of them, or even download a .wav or similar file and have a look at the spectrum just for fun.  I managed to find this University of Birmingham website through searching, and it plays sound clips from four different stars when the cursor is hovered over each one (it takes a while to become responsive I assume due to downloading).  [website]Roughly how long is the observation time of the star necessary to produce these audio recordings of a few seconds in length? Where can I find downloadable data; either these .wav sound clips or more traditional raw data files that I could analyze?      "
1460,Existence of planets larger than their host star?,"The mass region of objects between ~ 0.5 Jupiter masses and 80 Jupiter masses (gas giants through to brown dwarfs and red dwarfs) is typified by an almost flat relationship with object diameter. There are planets out there which are larger than some of the smallest stars.    The smallest (currently fusing) star known, EBLM-J0555-57, is estimated to be slightly larger than Saturn (at about 59000 km radius with 85 times Jupiter's mass).  One of the largest planets known that isn't a suspected brown dwarf, WASP-79b is estimated to be twice Jupiter's diameter at 0.9 times Jupiter's mass. Many Hot jupiters and puffy planets with similar measurements are known.  How likely are there to be systems where a planet is larger than its host star? Are there any examples known?  I am looking for currently fusing stars only, which rules out pulsar planets, etc. "
1461,What would a gas giant consisting of only earths atmosphere look like?,"Putting aside how such a planet could be formed and just lets assume it exists.  What would an gas giant ""look"" like if it just consisted of the gas compound earths atmosphere consists of.  Could we just watch through it? Would we see a burning core and therefore see something like a dim star? Or would there be still causes that would block vision, even if there were no other components included?  And would such a planet be able to hold it self together? "
1462,"Is ""Main Sequence"" a temporal sequence?","Stars plotted by luminosity and surface temperature fit into patterns in a Hertzsprung–Russell diagram.  A rough diagonal subset of this plot is called the main sequence.  Is this in any sense a temporal sequence?  There's a clue in the stellar physics section of the wikipedia article that the answer is no, but that it once was thought so:     Contemplation of the diagram led astronomers to speculate that it might demonstrate stellar evolution, the main suggestion being that stars collapsed from red giants to dwarf stars, then moving down along the line of the main sequence in the course of their lifetimes.   So does the word ""sequence"" in this case now mean just a particular ordering, and not a progression over time that any one star makes?  Is the main sequence just some kind of plateau in stellar evolution where stars spend a significant duration?   "
1463,"If gaseous planets have solid core, can they theoretically be considered as rocky planets?","I read that gaseous planets such as Jupiter and Saturn, have a solid core deep inside. So, I wondered whats the difference between them and rocky planets apart from the fact that they have - what can supposedly be considered, a very thick atmosphere, and that their atmospheric pressure would probably be too high.  Is there any other difference which I am missing? I mean, if we go by definition, couldn't all their gaseous content, be considered as an atmosphere? "

1465,LIGO gravitational wave chirp signal frequency,"This question is about the LIGO gravitational wave signals' frequency. The signals start from about 35 Hz to peak at about 250 Hz, giving evidence of gravitational waves. The question is about the exact frequencies the waves' detection started to the exact peak of the wave.   It seems the LIGO graphs show the peak is a little  above  250 Hz. Are there tables published by LIGO that put the start and peak frequencies as 35 to 250 Hz? The graph in the paper by Abbott, et al shows the start and peak (the start is around 36-37  Hz, the peak seems to be at around 256 Hz) - are there exact numbers (tables) for the start and peak, that one can reference?  "
1466,What causes cold temperature extremes?,"Recently I looked into the coldest(and hottest, but in another question) natural places. I discover this to be the Boomerang Nebula, with a freezing temperature of about −272.15 °C. Then I looked at the reason.       The outflowing gas is moving outwards at a speed of about 164 km/s and   expanding rapidly as it moves out into space; this gas expansion   results in the nebula's unusually low temperature.           [website]        This allows the gas to lose its heat. It works on the same principle   as that of refrigerators where expanding gas allows cooling.           [website]     Now I am sort of confused. How exactly can expanding gas lose heat, and lose it to such extent? And gas should cool to the ""universal surface temperature"", or the cosmic microwave background temperature if it stays there. However, it cools 2 °C lower. How does this happen? Would there be bose-einstein condensate matter there? "
1467,Different radio process band ranges,"If we want to observe a galaxy for which we have optical data, what parameters we need to know to calculate its total radio flux at 3 cm?  Specially I am interested to know how to differentiate among the different process in radio, like synchroton, free-free and inverse compton? Specially when I know its Hydrogen recombination line luminosity is in the power of 42, and electron temperature 10000 K with distance 20 Mpc  From literature, I assume 3 cm is 10GHz, which should fall under either synchroton or free-free emission. But how do I know exactly? "
1468,Why don't we see more supernovae in our galaxy?,"I found this on the Wikipedia page on supernovae:     The total supernova rate in our galaxy is estimated to be about 4.6 per century, or one every 22 years, although we haven't actually observed one for several centuries.   That sounds like a freak occurrence to me.  It made me curious about the numbers so I refreshed my knowledge on the Poisson distribution. It is not specified how many centuries we have not seen a supernova, but let's assume it's only two.  If on average 9.2 supernovae happen per 2 centuries then the chance of having exactly 9 in any two century period can be calculated with:  [tex]  Filling in [tex],  [tex]  The chance that there is not a single supernova in a two century period is:  [tex]  That's about a 1 in 10,000 chance. If ""several"" means 3 centuries, then the chance of not having any supernova is as little as 1 in 100,000.  So from this I can only come to the conclusion that supernovae did in fact happen in the Milky Way in the last two centuries, but that we didn't see any of them.  But now I'm confused. I read about supernovae that have happened in galaxies billions of light-years from here that lit up as the brightest source of light in the sky for days. Surely we would be able to see all of the supernovae that happen in our Milky Way (no more than 100,000 light years away) with the naked eye, let alone with telescopes?  Are some supernovae so much more super than others? Are all of the Milky Way's supernovae visible to the naked eye? "
1469,How to shift AGN x-ray spectrum to rest frame from,"I have limited information to shift a spectrum (in the x-ray 0.5-10 keV bandpass) at redshift z=2 to rest frame. I have a plot of normalized (photon) counts s[tex] keV[tex] by energy (keV), and so I have no information to compute the flux density. Is there a way to shift the spectrum I have to rest frame? Or do I really need luminosity distance, etc.? "
1470,What causes hot temperature extremes?,"Recently I looked into the hottest(and coldest, but in another question) natural places. I find this to be a ""cloud of searing gas that is surrounding a swarm of galaxies clustered together five billion light-years away in the constellation of Virgo"". This place has a temperature of 300 million degrees Celsius, which is super hot even compared to the temperature at our Sun's core. A quick search why gives:     A group of galaxies collided violently with another swarm of galaxies at a speed of 2,500 miles per second.           [website]     However, what mechanism exactly causes this temperature? Friction? Or something else? Would stars there be fusing stuff from the outside?  "
1471,What is the proper interpretation of a negative parallax?,The Gaia data release 2 dataset has some parallaxes listed as negative. What is the proper interpretation of this? Should they be discarded as bad data? Use their absolute value to calculate the distance? Use them as-is and treat them as negative distances along the right ascension/declination vector? 
1472,Why is there a gap in this image of supernova discoveries?,"I came across this gif showing supernova discoveries from the late 19th century to 2010. Here's the data in 2010:    Notice that there's a prominent region shaped like an inverted U in which there are few detection points, which I have crudely enclosed:    Why is this? Is it an artifact of detectors simple not observing that part of the sky, or is there some underlying astronomical reason? "
1473,"What was the first astronomical measurement which demonstrated that ""the Earth is surrounded by vacuum""?","The question Who was the first to realize that the Earth is surrounded by vacuum? was closed because some users felt it was answered by answers to a different question in an different SE site: Who was the first to postulate that space was a vacuum?  To me the distance between realize and postulate is astronomical!  That aside, I've asked a new question: What was the first astronomical measurement which demonstrated that ""the Earth is surrounded by vacuum""?  By demonstrated I'm talking about a measurement that shows it is, or at least is likely to be the case that Earth is surrounded by vacuum. It should be something such that it could be presented as scientifically convincing evidence to other scientists of the time, unencumbered by non-scientific predispositions (e.g. religion, rivalry, philosophy...)  "
1474,How fast was the Earth spinning directly after the Moon formed?,"I understand the Moon was perhaps five Earth radii away when it first formed (assuming it was formed by a giant impact of a Mars-sized body), and Earth has since transferred its rotational energy into the moon's orbital energy. How fast would Earth have been spinning at the point the Moon was formed? Assuming it was spinning very fast (day under 10 hours) would this have caused a noticeable decrease in effective ""gravity"" at the equator? Presumably the Precambrian microbes could have reached equatorial orbit really easily, assuming they had a space program. "
1475,"If nothing can pass the schwarzschild radius, how can black holes even start?","From our point of view, no object can fall into a black hole in finite time. The object will seem to be more and more red-shifted to us, but it will never quite pass the schwarzschild-radius / event horizon. (Of course the time frame of the falling object is another thing, but we are well away from any direct effects of black holes on us)  Having said that, how can black holes come to existence? As soon as there would be a schwarzschild radius, nothing can cross it. To me this seems like a chicken-and-egg problem, so no black holes can possibly exist.  Obviously the black holes in our universe do not seem to be aware of this, so what am I missing?  Thanks in advance :-) "
1476,"Relation between black hole mass and radius, and our universe's","Is there a graph of known black holes, with their estimated mass in the X axis and their estimated radius in the Y axis? If so, where can we find it? I would like to know if a black whole with the whole estimated mass of our universe would have the estimated radius of our universe (which means our universe could be a black hole, that's why light can't escape it and it looks ""finite""). "
1477,Why do certain moons have their rotational period equal to their orbital period?,"Our moon and Saturn's moon, Titan, have this feature.  Because of this we only observe one side (hemispere) of our moon. Why is this?  What is the Newtonian or astrophysics that would explain this?  It seems that it would be some kind of equilibrium that is arrived at over time, but I don't understand it. "
1478,Could the 9th planet be virtual?,"Astronomers recently claim that there is evidence for a 9th planet. As far as I understood it, this is mainly based on coinciding orbital parameters of a few Kuiper belt objects.  Could the 9th planet be a virtual planet? I mean this in the sense that we see the gravitational influence of a multi-body system. Could the 9th planet simply be the barycenter of the Kuiper belt and its apparent orbit some form of precession?  Apart from the question, if this was a possible or likely scenario, how could we distinguish a ""real"" 9th planet from a virtual one, except by the obvious answer if we can observe it directly?  Forgive me, if this is a stupid or trivial question or if this was answered before. I am not a professional astronomer, yet I have a physics/engineering background. I did a quick internet search to answer this question but I simply may have used the wrong terms or sources. "
1479,Does the dust around SMBH's protect habitable planets from jets?,"The supermassive black hole in the Milky Way is covered by dust as seen from here. Is it common that SMBH's are covered in dust in their galactic disks? Would that dust absorb and disperse a jet from an active galactic nucleus, so that the atmospheres of Earth like planets would be protected?  AGN jets build bubbles perpendicular to the galactic plane, but the jet could be oriented in any direction, right? The bubbles are shaped by general stellar winds from the disk, redirecting the jet streamed material towards the galactic poles, if I get that rigt. "
1480,Material exchange between a planet and its host,"Of the exoplanets found so far, is there one that can exchange material with its host? How could we prove that?  Io might be a good example, but it is not a planet. "
1481,What possible effects of life replicating on gas giant atmosphere?,If bacteria managed to arrive then thrive somehow (if not already) on a gas giant could it cause the atmosphere to expand or contract in volume?  Would living matter potentially induce energy into the planets system to heat it up? 
1482,Which is the shape of the sky?,"I'm a software developer and I'm developing a planetarium and the first thing that I don't know is: What is the shape of the sky?  First, I though that it is a semi-sphere, but searching on Internet I have found a lot of youtube tutorials, and all of them draw a semi-sphere but flatten (you can search skydome on Google and find a lot of tutorials).  My question is, how can I represent sky on a virtual 3D world? How much do I need to flat a sphere to get a real sky representation? "
1483,What if the black hole in the center of the galaxy grew faster?,"Imagine that hypothetically the black hole in the center of the milky way gradually increased in mass by for example 50% every year. That is exponential increase in mass.  Which visual effects would we see on for example Alpha Centauri, stars more distant and on M31? Red or blueshift? Lensing?  How about linear increase in mass?  Are there software I can use to visualize it as seen from earth? "
1484,What happens to the energy from a GRB?,"A gamma ray burst produces somewhere around 1044 J of energy, according to Wikipedia. Only a small portion of that energy will be absorbed by other objects.  The rest of that energy will go on to travel the universe indefinitely I presume?  How do we know how much of the universes total mass-energy is in ""in transit"" in the form of gamma rays and other forms of radiation? "
1485,How to calculate the limiting magnitude of Hubble?,"I've found various sources on the web stating that the limiting apparent magnitude of the Hubble Space Telescope is about 31 or 31.5. Wikipedia lists that here and it has a cite to a pdf about it.  What I want to know is how is that calculated?  I'm aware of two methods found at the bottom of a table here, but they seems to be general calculations for ground-based telescopes, because if I plug in Hubble's numbers, I get something around 21. The difference between an apparent magnitude of 21 and 31 is actually something like ten thousands times (in terms of brightness).  Also, one key factor missing in their formulas is exposure time. I'm pretty sure the limiting magnitude has something to do with exposure time. Hubble Ultra Deep Field, for example, had an exposure time of about 1 million seconds.  So to sum up, how would we calculate the limiting magnitude of a space-based telescope, in visible light? "
1486,Why is the core of a gas giant supported by electron degeneracy pressure instead of nuclear fusion?,"After a Sun-sized protostar forms, its core will become denser over time due to radiation. The core eventually gets dense and hot enough for hydrogen fusion to take place. In the late phases of the star's life, the core will continue fusing hydrogen until it runs out and outer layers begin fusion hydrogen, while dumping helium into the core. The core will get massive enough that it will begin to contract, and it will eventually become electron degenerate due to the high densities.  However, as the core became denser and denser, it reached temperatures at which fusion could take place, but it did not become dense enough for the matter to become electron degenerate, right? Only later in its life, when the star's hydrogen ran out, would it become dense enough for that.  So then why would gas giant cores be electron degenerate, but not become hot enough for nuclear fusion? Shouldn't they start fusing before they can become electron degenerate, as stars do? Am I misunderstanding this concept entirely, or is there more to it than what I described? "
1487,Nodes and declinations of Moon,"This nice page from NASA has the possibility to create an astronomical events calendar for a certain period. I tried to do that for the year 2017 for Central Europe. What comes out puzzles me:  On July 8th the Moon is at it's south Declination. On July 12th the Moon goes through the descending node. On July 22nd it finds itself at the north Declination.   I had always though the south Declination means the southernmost point of the Moon on its orbit. Furthermore I had always thought the descending node is the point the Moon passes by going ""down"" in its motion. How can it reach a southernmost point and later go even further downwards? I had been inclined to think that the north and south Declinations would be about half way between nodes (give or take due to slight changes during the motion). How can the Moon be in one of these south or north points and only 4 days later pass a node? And take again 9 more days to reach a south/north Declination again?   It would be nice if the answer could, besides clarifying these concepts (ascending and descending node, south and north Declination), point me to a reading where they as well as other Moon orbital points and parameters are clearly defined and explained.

1490,What is the projection of Earth's axis on the sphere with the Sun in center (see explanation),"Seems like it is the most convenient SE community for this question..   Imagine the sphere, witch center is the Sun and radius is, say, ~1.5 distance from Sun to earth (in arbitrary time, precise number doesn't matter much). EDIT: the center of sphere is 'attached' to the Sun.  Then, imagine, the Earth's axis projection on that sphere in time. It leaves some trace.  What will be the picture? Will it repeat itself through some period? What will be the ""scansion"" for different time periods?  EDIT: as reply to comments I'll add, that my interest is purely out of curiosity, and degree of required accuracy is low. I don't want high precision here, just rough pattern. As I understand this could be done, using mentioned Milankovitch cycles, but I'm not much into mathematics. Though, if I'll not find answer here, I will be forced (by myself) to figure this out, when i'll get some spare time heh. "
1491,Could we see planets around active Stellar Mass Blak Hole?,"This question is a followup of Is there any theoretical or empirical research about planetary systems with a black hole in their center?;   Since it is possible to detect planets around stars with the change of light they cause, I would think it should also be possible to detect them when they orbit around an active Stellar Mass BH.  From what I (can) understand from the first answer, there is no known case of planets orbiting around Stellar Mass BH. What could be preventing us to observe it?   Is there too few active Stellar Mass BH close enough for us to have a chance the system's plan is well aligned with us?  Do we only see Stellar Mass BH when they have a stellar companion feeding them, and this discards to possibility for close-by planets? Or is it because the light we can see from them is too fast-changing for a wobble or transition to be observable with today telescopes?  "
1492,What exactly is this VLA radio image of Jupiter showing?,"This VLA image is beautiful, and instructive, but I don't understand it fully.     This version is from an article in Gizmodo where the credit reads: A radio image of Jupiter captured by the Very Large Array. Image: Imke de Pater, Michael H. Wong, Robert J. Sault and which cites the recent article in Science: Peering through Jupiter’s clouds with radio spectral imaging. However, that paper does not actually show this image.  Another version of the image can be found in Berkeley News: New radio map of Jupiter reveals what’s beneath colorful clouds and gives more information how the image was produced.       A radio image of Jupiter from the VLA at three wavelengths: 2 cm in blue, 3 cm in gold, and 6 cm in red. A uniform disk has been subtracted to better show the fine banded structure on the planet. The pink glow surrounding the planet is synchrotron radiation produced by spiraling electrons trapped in Jupiter’s magnetic field. Banded details on the planet’s disk probe depths of 30-90 km below the clouds. This image is averaged from 10 hours of VLA data, so the fine details seen in the other maps are smeared here by the planet’s rotation. Image by Imke de Pater, Michael H. Wong (UC Berkeley), Robert J. Sault (Univ. Melbourne).   I would like to know more about how the image was processed. What does it look like before the uniform disk is subtracted - is the radio emission from the region around the planet actually as strong as the planet disk itself, as this image suggests? If there is a reference for this image I'd also like to read it!  In the mean time, it really is beautiful!  The image is sometimes paired with the following image, taken here from Science News.    Since this image resolves lateral detail, I'm guessing it might be the same 10 hours of data, but processed with a moving frame and corrected for distortion as it wraps around during the rotation of the planet, while the global image above is smeared by rotation  Was it? Where can I read more about this? "

1494,How long do hot X-ray sources last?,"Some X-ray sources in nebulae are caused by hot materials in the millions of degrees that formed in supernovae. What's the cooling rate of this stuff? How long does it stay this hot?  If we would take our solar system for example, the time from the formation of the nebula (by a supernova?) until it was cool enough to form solid planet was only a few million years. That's very quick, for instance relative to the age of the Earth. How ephemeral are these X-ray sources? I would expect them to not last as long as IR sources.  Is there an order of magnitude for the lifetime of the emission? Does it take millions of years? Tens of millions? Tens of thousands of years?  A comment suggests it doesn't really cool down, but diffuse to the interstellar medium. How long does it take for it to diffuse until there isn't a clear X-ray source? "
1495,Is the diameter of the observable universe a relative quantity?,The diameter of my observable universe is 90 billion ly measured in proper distance.

They are normally very safe from the harmful effects of radiation but what if their protection wasn't effective at all? What would be the effects on the human body if it is exposed to radiation?  
1497,How to compare a reflector telescope to a refractor one?,"I already have a small 60mm Tasco refractor (with 300mm focal lenght) and a homemade 40mm refractor (with 1300mm focal lenght) and I want to buy a new telescope to have a better experience (I don't have an EQ mount yet)  I face the current choice: for the same price, I can have a 70mm refractor (900mm fl) with a great EQ mount, or a 114mm reflector (900mm fl) with a less great EQ mount...  How can I compare those 2 two? They are not the same type, and I feel like comparing oranges with apples.   I know the technical difference between them, and I know the details about collimation. I just don't know how to rate them and chose one.  In short: Is it better a big reflector or a small refractor? (If I want to extend the information to other choices I might encounter) "
1498,How do we know the big bang didn't happen in an existing universe?,"I understand the evidence for the big bang (expansion, background radiation, etc), but how do we know that it was the start of the universe? Why couldn't it have occurred in an existing, but very sparsely populated universe? "
1499,How far away would a supernucleus comet be visible?,"If an instrument like LSST quickly spots something as soon as it reaches magnitude 24&half;, how far away would a 60km first-time visitor from the Oort cloud be when it is spotted? I'm thinking that a huge iceball will make a visible coma sooner, but have no idea what actual numbers would be.  And, given that distance and a parabolic orbit, how much time would that give before it crosses Earth's orbit? "
1500,Question related to Sun rise and Sun set times,"I am not sure whether this question is right or not so bear with me.  I understand 'Sun rise' and 'Sun set' is caused by the Earth's rotation.  I read that 'Sun light' takes around 8 minutes to reach Earth.  Every city in the world has its own 'Sun rise and Sun set' timings.   Lets assume the 'Sun rises' at 6 AM in 'City A'.    Does this mean that 'City A' sees/feels the light of the Sun which was in the sky @ 5:52 AM ?  In other words, does 'Sun rise' and 'Sun set' timings change according to 'light years'? "
1501,Why is the moon that special? Is it really a well built coincidence?,"I find it funny that the moon is the only object in the solar system to almost perfectly fit the sun, resulting in the spectacular solar eclipses. No other object except maybe a few irregular moons like Pandora from Saturn would do that, and for them, they aren't round, and thus can't fully block out all light. The moon also has a perfect rotation that is almost exactly the same as Earth's rotational period, resulting in a tidal lock, which causes tides.   Is this a coincidence? Any speculation on why this happens? Is this the only observed place where such criteria play into such perfect coincidence? "
1502,Does a week represent something in astronomy?,"I know that a day represent the time for the earth to make a full rotation around its own axis and a year is the time for the earth to make a full rotation around the sun.

1503,Why can't our Sun be a binary with Jupiter as a T or Y dwarf?,"I just learned about Brown Dwarfs, they are ""failed"" stars, they narrowly missed the stellar mass mark. I learned that Y Dwarfs have temperature as low as 80 Fahrenheit (The first one found by WISE observatory), why aren't those not called a Jupiter-like planets without a host star? Why do we call them a star and designate a separate category for them (T or Y)?  Ok suppose T and Y dwarfs are okay, let's leave them alone. But why can't Jupiter be a Y Dwarf who is in the binary relationship with the Sun? Sun-Jupiter's Barycenter is just outside the Sun, we could call them in orbit with each other correct? "
1504,what are the criteria for classification of galaxies,"There are lots of galaxies, for example, the Milky Way and so on. These galaxies consist of lots of stars. I want to know how galaxies are classified. Is it only by their shape that is caused by gravity? Or are there some other criteria? "
1505,Calculate latitude and longitude based on date and sun,"I can't seem to find this algorithm, if it exists. Can you calculate the longitude and latitude of where you are standing based on the date and the angle of the sun? Also, would the algorithm work for any date past or future?  Thanks for any help, AD "
1506,A neutron star without a flat surface and an atmosphere?,"In the Kurzgesagt video Atoms As Big As Mountains — Neutron Stars Explained they state that neutron stars have an atmosphere that reaches about 10 centimeters above the surface.   How is this possible? Wouldn't the strong surface gravity pull all of the material onto the surface of the star?  Further, Kurzgesagt also states that the neutron star has a surface variation of about 5mm. Still, wouldn't gravity pull it flat? Of is the gravity not strong enough to do so? "
1507,How to find Exomoons?,"How would we be able to detect Exomoons? We detect exoplanets by seeing if the light gets faint from a star, but could we really use the same method for determining if there is an exomoon around that exoplanet? Thanks for your thoughts and answers!  "
1508,Expansion again: where does the energy come from?,"Is it sensible to ask for the overall increase in potential energy when looking at the baryonic mass in the universe moving away from each other, that is, moving against the direction of the force towards a higher energy state in each others however weak gravitation field? I can't imagine that nature has the same take on this matter like a numerical simulation (a distance which it deems ""large enough to make effects negligible so let's forget about it completely""), i.e. the energy can't be zero... where does it come from? "
1509,"How large (that is, radius) could a planet be?","I know that normal planets don't get any larger than Jupiter (or 2 Jupiter radii if hot), as adding more gas just increases density, not radius, until you reach the point of being a brown dwarf star.  That compressability, I suppose, is a property of the overall average material that forms star systems, as beyond a critical size it accretes the ambiant gas as well as dust in the cloud.  That is, it's mostly hydrogen and a quarter helium with a bit of other stuff.  But what about a body made of other stuff, such as rock or metal? Without worrying about planetary formation processes, just that atoms are piled together and feel self gravity. Perhaps it needs to be grown slowly so it has time to cool before adding more. Otherwise, no special techniques: just what would happen if material of suitable composition was heaped together?  I suspect that normal ideas of minerals would not exist under that kind of pressure, even if carefully allowed to cool. But can elements other than H and He still compress their volume in the same way, or would a rocky world be able to reach sizes of millions of miles?  What about more exotic cases, like the ""puffy"" planet I heard of that has the density of styrofoam? "
1510,Capability of observing transits with terrestrial telescopes of various sizes?,"I have access to my university's telescope, Dearborn Observatory, an 18.5 inch refractor on the shore of Lake Michigan, just north of Chicago (yes, it's an atrocious location, but the telescope still works fantastically given this), and I was wondering if it would be possible to detect exoplanet transits.  I have access to a CCD.  Obviously, normally this would take quite a while, but I was looking at Wikipedia's list of transiting exoplanets and several of them have periods of less than 10 hours or so.  Are there any good resources about the math for this?  Or is the approximation that size of the change in light observed by the transit is just using the ratio of the area that the planet occludes to the area of the host star a reasonably good approximation?  Or is observing the transits of any known exoplanets completely unfeasible with this size of telescope?  From previous nights of photographing the sky, it seems like the telescope's limit is roughly magnitude 13-15, beyond which the signal-to-noise ratio is just too low to get meaningful data. "
1511,What is the next planned mission that can discover life on another planet?,"I've heard that we have a great shot at finding life on Mars if we just drill deep enough down to the surface to the water and detect if its sterile or not. Are there planned missions to do this? If not, what is the next (or existing) mission where finding life is likely? Is it launching something to Mars, Europa, Titan, or some other moon? Why does the mission have a good shot at finding life?  "
1512,"Boötes Void numbers, 2016","As a general science (hence Wikipedia!) reader, the latest information I have is that 60 galaxies ""have been found and counted"" inside the Boötes void, this of 1997.  (1) What is the latest count of galaxies ""known"" inside the Boötes void?  The Boötes void is a ball 250 million light-years across. (Say, .002 of the width of the visible universe?)  It seems - unbelievable - it has only 60 galaxies.  The ""60"" value (or some new number since 1997), maybe I am misunderstanding it, or it is misreported, or has a different meaning?  Galaxies are counted in the thousands or tens of thousands, it seems hard to believe in a cosmological space, the number ""60"" would come up.  So, what is (2) the thinking on how many galaxies there likely are in the Boötes Void? An order of magnitude.  Is it ""about 100,"" or ""about a trillion,"" or what?  What do you (3) normally quote galaxy density in?  Galaxies per Gpc3, or?  Indeed, I am trying to get a (4) comparative sense of galactic density in the Boötes void versus elsewhere. What is the galaxy density in the Boötes void, versus the universe in general, or if it's more meaningful versus perhaps superclusters, walls, or?  Is it ""one tenth as dense""?  One zillionth?  One half?  Just how void is that sucker?    Further...  BruceS below has usefully pointed out that, indeed, the ""60"" galaxies are anyway only in a small tube which apparently cuts through the Boötes Void.  Does this mean that, incredibly, the actual main body of the Boötes Void - putting aside that tube - is literally empty, no galaxies at all??  That seems totally incredible.  I feel we really need a galaxy-counting astronomer to clarify the nature of the Boötes Void. "
1513,Are mass extinction events more likely during meteor showers / passing through comet debris?,"Meteor showers happen when Earth passes through the debris left by a comet in its orbit. Meteors are generally tiny, like snow flings or pebbles and don't make it to the ground as meteorites. But periodic comets sublimate and disintegrate. Don't they shed kilometer sized fragments too? Maybe it is not only the comet which is the threat, but its entire orbit is a minefield too? Are bolides and observed meteorite falls more frequent during meteor showers? "
1514,Why does the Moon appear to be flat?,"There's no way around it: when I look at the full moon at night it looks like a mostly flat disc, with at most a bit convexity in the middle. Phases of moon look like a full moon seen through a cut-out.  Why is that the case? I recall, when I was really young, looking at it through what at the time seemed to be a very strong telescope, and it appeared not only a lot more textured but also a lot rounder. A similar thing can be seen in a video I saw a couple months ago, at 2:05: [website]I presume it's related to the optics, which made me hesitant to post it on this stack exchange (thinking it might be more suited to the physics one), but chose against it presuming people here would have more experience with celestial bodies and ""large"" distances.  I have a hunch that the answer is very simple, but I really don't know what that might be, especially since it's done over what I view as large distances. "
1515,Can we calculate the average temperature of the heliosphere?,"It is my understanding that one can measure the temperature of the universe by measuring cosmic microwave background radiation. Could we also use this method for calculating the average temperature of the heliosphere?  The average temperature of the universe has supposedly been measured in at 2.735 degrees above absolute zero. Presumably this measurement takes into account the massive amounts of 'empty' space which I imagine has a huge effect on the number.   My question: Can we measure the average temperature of the heliosphere? If so, then what is it?   This might be quite hard to define as how do you determine when our solar system ends? So for the purpose of this question the following assumptions should be made:   The distance from the Sun to the edge of the heliosphere is approximately 100AU (Roughly the size of the heliosphere as measured by Voyager 1). Assume the heliosphere is a perfect sphere. Assume we are measuring the black body equivalent temperature (as this is what was measured to calculate the temperature of the universe).   If we don't know how to measure this average temperature (which is likely if we can't differentiate between microwaves from in and outside the heliosphere) then how could we theoretically measure this value assuming a perfect environment? "
1516,Underground cave in Mars' Armstrong limit,"Can a cave, fissure, volcano vent etc. exist on Mars with in the Armstrong limit and support plant life if light and soil was provided?  I am not asking how deep is the Armstrong limit of Mars rather can natural deep areas of Mars exist underground?  At what depth on Mars would the atmosphere have equal pressure of that on Earth? "
1517,How can Halley's Comet be predictable?,How can we know that Halley's Comet is going to come again every 76 years? I understand that the comet has an orbit around the sun but how can scientists know that it won't be thrown off course for example by passing Jupiter and Jupiters gravity giving it a tug in a different direction? Its not a very big object in space so it seems to me that its orbit could be changed very easily. 
1518,Moon's path as seen from Earth,"As observed from the surface of Earth: Will the moon ever repeat the same path (trajectory)? If yes, what is the period of repetition? And also will the moon cover the night sky with its path completely over a period of time?  More explanation: I was observing the moon from my window and I was wondering will the moon follow the same path (trajectory) as it did before, and if I am taking photos all the different positions of the moon over a long period of time will it have covered the night sky? "
1519,"How will the recent appearance of a supernova, the closest in 27 years, help reduce the uncertainties in our measurements of dark energy?","A supernova has been recently spotted on M82, also known as the cigar galaxy. Being the closest to earth in 27 years and given the advances of technology this article proposes that:      ...as the Cigar Galaxy has been studied in detail thanks to images from the Hubble Space Telescope. ""It is likely that the star that blew up has been directly imaged""...      If astronomers do find the dying star in past images and are able to make accurate readings of its brightness before and after the explosion, we might be able to reduce the uncertainties in our measurements of dark energy by a factor of two.   How will it help reduce the uncertainty?. Furthermore, how would this help us better understand the way the universe is going to end?. "
1520,How to calculate conjunctions of 2 planets,"So, the recent conjunction of Jupiter and Venus seems to have spawned lots of excitement over this ""rare"" event. But what I can't figure out, is exactly how rare it is. And I've seen such conflicting claims and calculations that I figured I'd better calculate it myself. The only problem is I'm no astronomer. So, does anyone know of a program that can calculate all the conjunctions between a date range that are within a degree of each other? Or does smart person know how to calculate it manually? :)      I have a program called Stellerium which I've been using to view the various conjunctions that people have mentioned. I don't know if I can use it in the way I need it though. Any help? :) Thanks "
1521,Projecting an image of the sun / eclipse,"This might be an astronomy.stackexchange.com question, but I think it is more in line with a camera obscura.  During the last eclipse I didn't plan ahead and grabbed some lousy toy ""spy"" telescope we had (about 2 inches long), set it up on a tripod and pointed it at a white foam board.  I'd like to plan ahead more this time.    What can I use to project a decent image of the sun onto a foam board?  What kind of lens do I need?  Would a magnifying lens work?  How about a close-up diopter filter?  How about a 50mm lens?  (I'd like to use something I already have, or is cheap -- and I don't want to use a pin hole.)  My first thought was that a magnifying glass only focuses the sun down to a pin point (and would burn the board), but I'm recalling now that past that focal point you can project an image. "
1522,"How much larger would a star have to be to cause thermonuclear reactions if it was made out of mostly rock like Earth, instead of gases?",I assume it would have to be considerably larger since rock isn't as flammable as gases are?

1524,Do neutron stars have something like a gamma-ray photosphere? Are gamma rays from below it limited more by the nuclei or electrons?,"@RobJeffries' answer to Is there evidence of super-heavy elements in the x-ray and gamma-ray spectrums of neutron stars? includes the sentence:     However, the only things that contribute to a neutron star's observable spectrum are materials within a few cm of the neutron star surface.   and that reminds me a little bit of the Sun's photosphere. For our Sun, visible photons produced below the photosphere don't make it out, at least not without their spectrum being altered by scattering.  I think a similar thing can be said about the X-rays and gamma rays from inside a neutron star.  Question: Do neutron stars have something like a gamma-ray photosphere? Are gamma rays from below it limited more by the nuclei or electrons? "
1525,What are some of the best astronomy gatherings in the USA?,"I'm part of a local astronomy club but the results from that have been vastly underwhelming with a membership count of around 50-200 active people at any given time. All that being said- I guess my question is for 2019 what are the biggest and most informative gatherings in terms of astronomy? Anything you know of from lectures to imaging to stargazing would be wonderful.  More specifically: I was considering spending the 250 dollars to go to the Northeast Astronomy Forum this April 4th and 5th and the Northeast Astro Imaging Conference. It seems to be one of the larger scale events that happens anually. Is this a good event for beginners? Heres a link to their site:  [website][website]If youve been Id love to hear from you. If this is off-topic I apologize, but the only other place I had to ask was our clubs forum and it has virtually no traffic. "
1526,Accidental or deliberate?,"We know that the visual size of the Sun and Moon from the Earth in our lifetime (!) is nearly equivalent. Now my question: Is this event is random? Or have a scientific reason? For example, maybe there is a connection between this and the formation of life on the Earth... "
1527,"Wouldn't be ""dark matter"" better called ""massless gravity""?","In spite of being a simple words game, that would make me feel less uncomfortable, as there could be a mysterious field still less mysterious than matter that passes through itself etc. Moreover, couldn't be that there exist some high order terms that play a role only when mass reach big values, i. e. those comparable to a galactic mass? How/why this cannot be the case in general relativity?  "
1528,How to understand this multi-day exposure photograph of Jupiter and the Moon,"This answer includes a stunning photo of the Moon and Jupiter ""Trails of the Shifting Moon"" by photographer Jin Lu.  The caption reads:     From the photographer: ""I spent 4 days capturing the trail of the moon from the balcony of my house. This is a composite of 90 pictures, showing the shift of the path of the waxing Moon from crescent phase to near first quarter. Random floating clouds decorated the trails. The interval between each day's sequence of pictures ranges from 1.5 to 2 min. Besides the Moon, the most obvious celestial object in the composite is Jupiter. The trail of Jupiter is from pictures of Jan 9, the day the moon appeared closest to Jupiter in the evening sky. Although Jupiter looks closer to the Moon on Jan 8, that is not how it actually appeared then."" - Jin Lu   I'm confused by two things:   The Moon is shown for January 7, 8, 9, 10 and the caption says ""The trail of Jupiter is from pictures of Jan 9"". I'd expect Jupiter to have contributions from all four days, not just one day. How can that be? ""Although Jupiter looks closer to the Moon on Jan 8, that is not how it actually appeared."" If I measure the distance in pixels from the top-left Jupiter to the top-left Jan 8 and 9 Moons, the Jan 8 Moon is closer. How could that not be true in reality then?    "

Note: I'm not asking about the average monthly distance, but the unique distance traveled for each month.   "
1531,Computing the Sérsic profile of a galaxy from jpg images,"I am trying to calculate the Sérsic profile of various galaxies from the SDSS based on the images provided by the galaxy zoo site. I am doing this as part of a kaggle competition on using machine learning to predict galaxy morphology. I have no chance of a high rank in this competition so I'm not hesitant to ask for help.  I used the R contourLines function to identify the isophotes of the galaxy and then fit ellipses to each isophote. This seemed to work well, the isophotes are almost always well fit by the ellipses and the ellipses are nearly concentric. Then letting I be the pixel intensity of an isophote and R be the length of the semi-major axis of the corresponding ellipse, I need to fit an equation of the form  log I(R) = log I_0 - k * R^(1/n)   The simple approach seemed to be to take the log of both sides and use OLS regression, so I fit a linear model in R of the form  log(log(I)) ~ log(R)   The resulting graphs showed a good fit but the resulting Sérsic indices n are almost always less than one and never as big as two. This doesn't seem right since indices of 4 or higher seem common in my reading. I don't get anywhere near 4 for an image of M87.  Possibly taking log log flattens things out too much and the index is not responsive enough. I tried using nls to work with just the log but it didn't move the indices much.  Is there any standard software or algorithm for computing the Sérsic index from an image? Are there reference images I can work from that would let me check if my algorithm is reasonable? Any recommendations on how to proceed would be welcome.  UPDATE: I have found the programs GALFIT and GIM2D which look like they might be useful. Any other software that is commonly used for this? "

1538,Why was Pluto's resonance not discovered until 1965?,"Over here, I was shocked to learn:     The Neptune–Pluto system lies in a 3:2 orbital resonance. C.J. Cohen and E.C. Hubbard at the Naval Surface Warfare Center Dahlgren Division discovered this in 1965.   Note: there is no cite for it.  I'm pretty sure the orbit of Pluto, including it's period, was calculated many years before 1965, to say nothing of Neptune. So how is it possible that astronomers missed the 2:3 resonance? Was orbital resonance just not a conceived concept until the sixties? "

1541,Nuetrino interaction with plasma and electromagnetism,"Following question enter link description here  After watching the Thunderbolt Project on Youtube I have a very very very fresh perspective on the universe - the electric universe. From the electric comet theory that pretty much proves water forms at the comet, and comets are not frozen water.   In the solar wind all that hydrogen missing an electron and/or free electrons, fuse/react with oxygen-silicate elements of long orbit bodies that have been long long long holding opposite --- charges +++ inside and at the outside surfaces. When the rocky body nears a sun it gains plasma discharged from the sun, it arch's like a plasma torch, and water is formed, stealing the oxygen long held in the rock formation.  A comet is an asteroid that has just had a long long long time to build up a charge.   So with that and deep space showing dancing archs of electric plasma, ie space lightning, across the universe being as, or more influential as a force/energy, than gravity even, and with Einstein's admission that he was missing something in a unified theory, my question is: while neutrinos interact weekly with quote unquote solid matter, in a magnetic electrified universe are neutrinos subject to capture/interaction in Electro-magnetic currents or where voltage potential and capacitance is built up ? A?  I understand particle accelerators speed up sub atomic particles using electromagnetism but does it also translate that due to speed of atomic particles they are more likely to react with neutrinos than as a solid in out environment? B? "

I'm only looking for ballpark figures in all cases. "
1543,Why doesn't the Moonrise appear red when viewed from orbit?,"After searching through many videos, I finally found one that shows, from the perspective of low earth orbit, the Moon transiting the horizon. It is actually a Moonset, but it shouldn't make a difference.  The Moon does not appear to change its color, neither gold nor red.  This contrasts with my understanding of atmospheric effects. Here on Earth, the Moon does appear more yellow (and when halfway or less above the horizon, even red) during Moonrise. The atmosphere tends to scatter blue light, leaving only yellow and red behind.  So why isn't this happening in the video? From orbit, we should be seeing the Moon through even more atmosphere. But I can't detect a trace of red or yellow in the Moon.  Granted it's not the best quality video that it could be. It could be more zoomed in. But it was the only video I could find that showed the Moon transiting the horizon from space. "
1544,Why doesn't the fusion process of the sun speed up?,"Am I correct in saying that the fusion process of the sun is constant, i.e. X amount of fusion happens per day, more or less? Why does this not speed up, i.e. one fusion event creates energy for two fusion events, etc.? Does every collision of atom cause a fusion event, or is the probability small for a fusion event to happen thus it's not a runaway reaction? I have heard that the probability for fusion event to happen is only 1 in 1012 for every collision. "
1545,What is the axial tilt of a planet measured relative to?,"I am very much a beginner on the astronomy front but I understand about planets having different axial tilts, hence why Venus turns the opposite direction from the Earth and Uranus turns sideways.  However, I am confused as to what the axial tilt bearing is measured from. For example, if all planets were in a perfect line from the sun, would they spin perfect in alignment on their own various axial tilts? Would some still be 'off-set' by a few degrees to one side or the other?  Do we actually know please? "
1546,A rough analytical expression for the Milky Way's radial mass distribution?,"I found the image below in Space.com's article This 3D Color Map of 1.7 Billion Stars in the Milky Way Is the Best Ever Made, although it is not the map mentioned in the title.  The caption for this image reads:     This radial velocity image shows the movement of 7 billion stars. The colors run from blue (stars moving at 50 km/s toward us) to red (stars moving 50 km/s away from us). The white color shows when, on average, the stars are not moving in the line of sight with respect to us. Stars lagging behind as they orbit the center of the Milky Way appear to be traveling away from us, and those speeding up appear to be traveling toward us. Credit: ESA/Gaia/DPAC   If you imagine a band along the galactic equator the dominant velocity shows two positive and two negative ""peaks"", with a zero crossing in the direction of the galactic center.  Purely for fun I wanted to see if I could reproduce this behavior with a simple calculation based on a 2D calculation assuming circular motion and a radial density distribution [tex] which I could then use to figure out a rotational velocity distribution [tex], bun I swiftly realized that I have no idea what the density profile would look like.   For the purposes of this simple exercise, what would be an analytical expression that roughly matches the Milky Way's radial density profile, projected on to its equatorial plane? For spherically symmetric distributions, Newton's Shell theorem allows one to treat all mass inside a sphere defined by an orbit's radius as if it were at the center, and to ignore all mass in the shell outside of that radius. Is there anything like an analog to this for a radial distribution within a plane?    "
1547,Explaining Dark Matter and Dark Energy to layman,"With my little knowledge, I know this:  Dark Matter  The center of a galaxy controls/attracts its objects (stars, planets, comets etc.) towards itself because of gravity. But the mass of the center of this galaxy appears to be less than what it should take to attract all objects of the galaxy. Hence Dark Matter is there, which makes this attraction or controlling possible.  Dark Energy  This is the force which is pulling galaxies away from each other, and hence making the universe expand. If we don't have this hypothetical force, we cannot explain why distances between galaxies are increasing.  Question  Please let me know how far I am from the actual meaning/definition of these terms? And how can I explain these to a layman, who has no or very little knowledge about astronomy?  Thanks.  P.S.: I have read this question here, which is excellent but I could not get an idea of how to explain to a layman. "

1549,If FTL travel is possible can i look back in time to a younger earth?,For this question assume that.  We found a way to go faster than light.  I build a ship that could go faster than light and go to another planet with this ship in the span of mere hours. The ship was built in a year time.  If i travel to another planet one light year from earth and I would look back.  Would I see the ship being built?  Since the light that comes from earth is 1 year old when it reaches me you would assume that I can see the ship being built 1 year back(with a powerful telescope)  So my question is : If FTL travel is possible can i look back in time to a younger earth? 
1550,Where to get Polaris Right ascension value from,To calculate for example the polaris hour angle I use this formula to calculate polaris hour angle.  τ = θ - α  τ= hour angle  θ= sideral time  α= polaris RA (~ 2h32m)  But where does the α=2h32m come from? Is there a list? Does this change somehow over time? Is my understanding correct that this is the time where polaris crosses the upper meridian at Greenwich? 
1551,about H$_\alpha$ and H$_\beta$ lines in astronomical objects' spectra,"Generally there may be some line ratio between the two lines.  If  H[tex] is strong, it is quite possible we can see H[tex] too.  Is it possible we can see H[tex], but can not see H[tex]? In what kind of environments can it happen? "
1552,Observing the night sky with a 6-year old,"We currently possess a Celestron NexStar 130 SLT computerized reflector telescope and have an opportunity to do backyard astronomy with my 6-year old daughter from time to time.  She is quite interested in space and astronomy, knows a lot of objects in the Solar System, which have atmosphere and what don't, knows major planet satellites and thinks there is life on Titan.  But, I find it quite challenging to actually do telescope observations with her:   it takes time to set things up, assemble the equipment and align the telescope. She is not patient enough and that sometimes ""kills"" all the fun and excitement it is not easy for her to get used to looking through an eyepiece it is easy to touch the telescope which leads to a shaking image   What are the general guidelines to observe the night sky with the 6-year old? What can I do to make the process less tedious, more fun and engaging?  (we also have the 15x70 Binoculars) "
1553,What is 'Dark Fluid'?,"Is this term official jargon/wording for 'Dark Matter'? If so, why include the word ""Fluid"" if there is supposedly no viscosity in actual space. It would be like saying 'Hey, want to go swim in my 'gravel' pool?"" [website]"
1554,How to tell a crater is old or not?,"Based on Wikipedia, we can estimate the age of a planet's surface.  How to tell a particular crater is newly formed or not? It may have sharp edge.

1557,How strong would gravity need to be to prevent star formation,"This question got me thinking.  In another universe, with a different value for the gravitational constant G, how much bigger would G need to be for star formation to be prevented?  In other words in a hypothetical universe, the star would attempt to ignite, but the force of gravity would overwhelm the star's outward pressure and you would just get a black hole instead.  I'm not looking for a precise answer here... just ROM... 10 times bigger? 10,000 times bigger? "
1558,Would the (orbitting) speed of the Earth change if suddenly the sun disappear and the Earth is thrown into space?,"Usually an orbit is considered as an acceleration. So if the Earth has a speed of about 100.000km/h around the sun.  Now I think there is some relativity involved, so from which point of view shall we observe those speeds? But lets imagine that we stand on mars which stays still compared to the Earth and the sun, only the Earth is moving.   Shall we measure a different speed when the Earth is thrown into space? Would it be more of less than 100.000km/h? Or is there something missing? "
1559,Can we track matter through time by looking at different depths in space?,"If we look back far enough we can see all the origins of the universe, so is it possible, even if not feasible, that we could trace the history of some matter as it moves through space-time? I want to understand how looking at different depths in space and time are correlated in regards to the matter being observed.   For example would it be possible to look deep into a certain part of space and time to find some galaxy that contributed to the matter that makes up the Milky Way today? Then somehow follow it through space-time by looking at different depths and locations in space, and see how it came to be part of the Milky Way? "
1560,What will the last days of Earth be like?,"The sun is a main-sequence star; as I understand it the sun will expand into a red giant in a few billion years.  I have heard conflicting reports of what this entails - some sources I found say the sun will expand until the current orbit of Earth is contained within it, others say it will stop expanding short of Earth's current orbit.  Every source has agreed that the planet will have long-since stopped being able to support life as we know it.  Assuming humanity takes no action to significantly alter the natural course of events, such as dramatic alterations of our atmosphere, what will the last few decades of Earth's life be like?  Will the planet be heated to the point where its surface is like Mercury's sun-side?  Will the sun's output drop low enough that it instead cools, like Mars?  Will the sun expand and engulf the planet, or will the planet continue to orbit an expanded sun as a lifeless ball?  Will the sun's expansion be gradual or rapid?  How will this expansion affect the rocky planets nearest to it? "
1561,What is the highest angle the moon ever makes above the horizon at the North Pole?,"The question is in the title. I'd like to find out the maximum angle the moon ever makes above the horizon at the North Pole. By ""the horizon at the North Pole,"" I mean the tangent plane to the earth at that point.  Note that I'm not asking for the highest angle that the moon ever appears to make above the horizon. Appearances are distorted by refraction, etc., although I'm not sure by how many degrees. Though I'd be interested in the exact distortion: is there a data repository where I can look up the highest observed angle?   I would make the following prediction. The moon's orbital plane is inclined to the earth's equatorial plane at about [tex] degrees. Let [tex] denote the radius of the earth and [tex] denote the radius of the moon's orbit around the moon. A little geometry for the highest point suggests  [tex]  But because [tex] (about 385,000 compared to 6300 km), [tex] should be just a little less than [tex].  Is this right? "
1562,Which would be safer: removing hydrogen or adding hydrogen to our sun?,"If we want to extend the lifespan of our habitable zone safely, would it be safer to institute a yearly 'tax' on our suns outer layer of hydrogen, or a yearly 'subsidy' to our suns outer layer of hydrogen?  (the feasibility of said tax/subsidy is beyond the scope of this question)  Another way to ask this question: Assuming the core of the sun remains untouched, but its outer layer of hydrogen were reduced by half, would the suns main sequence remain intact for a longer time?  To avoid ending up with a white dwarf and its associated bad weather, what would be the ideal point to reverse the tax and re-subsidize? "
1563,What kinds of stars would it be possible to observe in M31 with a small amateur telescope?,"I was wondering what kinds of stars would be visible in M31 and other nearby galaxies using a moderate (~8"") telescope and a CCD camera. This would be a limiting magnitude of around 17.  I have heard of LBVs (Luminous Blue Variables). However, I would like to know what spectral class of stars would most likely be visible (would it be mainly OBA type stars)?  The context of this question is in the search for extragalactic transiting exoplanets. Current amateur detectors have the capability to detect planets with host star apparent magnitudes of 14. I was wondering if it might be possible to find exoplanets in M31, M33 or even the LMC/SMC with these limits. An advantage to searching for planets in M31 would be the very limited search region--an amateur astronomer would only have to perform photometry on the M31 region over several months or years to find a planet, rather than having to search a much larger region.  Are there any other issues with detecting transiting planets around very luminous stars? Would the percent dip in brightness be far less for a Jupiter sized planet? How would this affect our ability to detect extragalactic transiting exoplanets? "
1564,Why is $g$ tied to the oscillator strength $f$ in $\log{gf}_{\odot}$,"The [tex] value of an element in a star, where [tex] is the oscillator strength, or probability of transition in an atom, is a scientifically pursued quantity with relation to the model atmosphere of the star. Why is the oscillator strength tied to [tex]? And what is the motivation for including this quantity in a stellar model? "
1565,Did OSO-3 or any other spacecraft or ground telescope record the solar activity that is likely the cause of the May 1967 aurora?,"The question What solar event caused massive aurora borealis in the mid 1960's? reminds me again of a stunningly bright aurora that I saw circa 40°N circa 1967, and after reading the comments and answers on that page I've considered the following:   Orbiting Solar Observatory program (OSO) OSO-3 Launch date March 8, 1967 This comment mentions :     The May 1967 aurora is quite famous for being one of the occasions when we nearly stumbled into nuclear war.    Question: Did OSO-3 or any other spacecraft or ground telescope record the solar activity that is likely the cause of the May 1967 aurora? "
1566,Higgs field interactions in universe,"Is the Higgs field found everywhere? Is it responsible for our mass, and are we in the Higgs field? "
1567,Definition of stellar core?,"This is a basic question, but I may as well ask it. I had always thought that the core of a main-sequence star is defined as the part hot enough for nuclear fusion. Some dictionaries seem to agree with this.  However, many books say that protostars and pre-main-sequence stars also have cores, though they are not undergoing hydrogen fusion.  So what exactly is the definition of a stellar core? If it doesn't necessarily have to be hot enough for fusion, what separates it from the rest of the star? "
1568,"What is this bright ""glow"" in the center of galaxies?","It was always my belief that at the center of many galaxies, there are supermassive black holes. If this is the case, then we should not see a ""light"" coming out from the center since light get's sucked in black holes. Doing a quick search of galaxies on google image, I came across this:        These are famous galaxies, and real, and so I was wondering what this very white-yellow glow is in the center. If it is a collection of stars, then why are there so many stars in the center of a galaxy? If there is a black hole there, then why is there light? "
1569,Milky Way mass fraction breakdown review,"I'd like to know a breakdown of the mass of the Milky Way, by the major categories. So, something like  Stars       ... 3% Cool nebula ... 7% Gray matter ... 12% Etc Etc   This order-of-magnitude knowledge that everyone should know.  (Of course, when talking of the galaxy, we can, obviously, think of either just the visible disk-bulge, or perhaps, a greater unit of the galaxy sitting in a ""bulb"" (of - perhaps - dark matter (?), gas (?), dust (?), halo stars (?) or something else): a brief clear answer in a few sentences would expose these concepts.)  Surprisingly, this information is nowhere to be found in one place as an overview.  I appreciate that the largest chunk may be dark matter (is that right?); but I don't even have a ballpark idea for the rest. It's the sort of knowledge that is obvious to professionals, but surprisingly not outlined in any of the usual popular science sources. "
1570,Does the relative motion between planets other than Venus and Earth form shapes such as the Flower of Venus?,"I was reading about the Pentagram/Flower of Venus, and how it is caused by a 13:8 ratio between their orbits. I found this GIF particularly fascinating.   My question is, if the ratio changed, would they form other kind of ""fractal"" shapes? Does this happen between other planets? What would be the condition for the ratio so that the relative motion forms a symmetrical shape like the Cardioid in the case of Venus and Earth? "
1571,Are there currently observed systems of close (narrow) binary brown dwarfs?,"All over the Universe, there are (gravitationally bound) binary star systems. Considering the huge number of brown dwarfs, are there currently known double systems of gravitationally bound binary brown dwarfs? Given their comparatively low gravitation, how long would they need to melt together to a larger object? What happens if binary brown dwarfs collide? Is this anyway a matter of any interest? "
1572,Star systems forming when large gravitational force is applied,"As far as I'm concerned, most star systems in our galaxy are traveling in fairly circular paths around the black hole at the center.   Hypothetically, if a large gravitational force pulled star systems closer to the center of our galaxy would binary star systems result? If two stars of different masses were travelling in a centripetal motion around the center of our galaxy, and they were pulled towards the center (which i think would result in two different accelerations completely) could a situation result where two stars collide or join into a system? What is the most probable event to happen in this situation besides two stars not approaching eachother? "
1573,Moving light in night sky,"Today at about 2 am I have spotted a light very similar (perceived speed and apparent brightness, motion due East) to ISS. At very first I thought to have spotted the station but immediately I doubted about as I feel that the observation time is too far from sunrise. ISS is indeed ruled out as there is not email from the spot the station service in my inbox. Can satellites orbiting at higher orbits be see even in deep night?  I feel that answers is yes based on simple geometry. However what could reflect so much light? I think there are not objects with reflecting surface so big to be compared to those of ISS...  "
1574,"Is the moon inside earth’s atmosphere? If so, what are the consequences?","Recently, a paper was published claiming that the Earth’s atmosphere extends far beyond the Moon. This has been reported on by a number of news sources and websites, including the ESA, Business Insider, Space.com, and EarthSky.org.  If these findings are true, how does this affect the current understanding related to the measured atmospheric pressure, the currently accepted pressure in space between the Earth and the Moon, the pressure on the Moon, the effect of Earth's gravity on the atmosphere, and Earth's ability to maintain this extensive atmosphere while traveling through the Solar System? Is the atmosphere gradually lost or replenished?     Image credit: European Space Agency "
1575,Oscillation in tilt of the solar system,"I know that the solar system is tilted 62.6° to the plane of the galaxy.  I'm curious whether this angle changes over time, and what are the extents and time frame of any such oscillations if they exist?  Upon reflection, I'm assuming that since such an oscillation would require a change in the overall angular momentum of the entire solar system, and that would necessitate a collective re-orientation of the orbit of every planet, dwarf planet, SSSB, etc. related to the Sun that it's unlikely that any such mechanism exists? "
1576,Semimajor axis variations in co-orbital moons,"I've been playing with simulations of co-orbital bodies similar to Saturn's moons Janus &amp; Epimetheus- horseshoe orbits where the two bodies are of comparable mass- and I'm seeing some very odd patterns that I can't explain.  What ""should"" happen is that the body with the slightly smaller orbit will eventually overtake the outer body; when their mutual interaction becomes significant compared to their interactions with the primary, the lower body is accelerated forward into a higher orbit, while the higher body is accelerated backward into a lower orbit, they switch positions around their average orbital radius, and then separate again.  What I'm seeing in simulation, however, is a little more complicated. When I simulate the Saturn+Janus+Epimetheus system, the moons' semimajor axis very slowly migrate farther away from their average up until they swap; right around the swap, the difference in semimajor axes is maximized, and they drift closer together for half a cycle and then farther apart again before the next swap. This creates ""u"" and ""n"" shapes on the plot of semimajor axis over time, with the plots for each moon in opposite phases.  For Janus and Epimetheus, the effect is very small, but increasing the masses of the moons amplifies it, to the point that the maximum separation in orbital radii that occurs during the moons' closest approach to each other is ten or more times larger than the ""normal"" separation during the middle of a cycle.  There is of course the possibility that this an artifact of errors in my simulation software, but I think that is unlikely given the following:   All other aspects of the Janus+Epimetheus system are reproduced perfectly- individual orbital periods are correct, average semimajor axes are correct, the frequency of the swaps is correct, and my simulation conserves energy to within less than 1 part in 1 trillion over a petasecond of simulation time (approx. 31,689 years). The effect is perfectly regular, and simulated systems remain stable. If the effect was a result of simulation errors, I wouldn't expect them to behave so nicely.   My first thought was that perhaps the semimajor axis of each moon was being affected by the added gravity of the other moon when they are on opposite sides of the primary from each other, and when they approach more closely they won't be pulling each towards the primary as strongly. That, however, should result in a uniform expansion and contraction of both moons' orbits as they get respectively closer and farther away from each other. What I actually see is that the inner moon's orbit gets smaller while the outer moons orbit gets larger, and vice-versa.  So, is this likely to just be a simulation error after all (if it helps, I am using the 4th-order Hermite integration algorithm)? If not, what is the explanation for it? Has such an effect been documented before, and if so, where? "
1577,"Conventional matter to dark matter ratio, outside of galaxies","Consider say this outstanding diagram from another question,    To begin with galaxies have a typical density D. Intergalactic space has a much lower density d.  As we know: in galaxies (with density D) most of the stuff is dark matter.  Let's say for convenience it is 10:1.  So, the ratio of dark matter in galaxies is (we'll say) 10:1.  But here's what I can not find explained anywhere:  (1) In intergalactic space. First of all simply is there any dark matter?  Or, do we believe that dark matter exists, simply, only in galaxies? Not between?  (2) If there is dark matter between galaxies. Do we know or believe: what is the ratio of dark matter out there?  In fact, is it just the same ratio (say, 10:1) as inside galaxies? Or, is it perhaps even more dominant, or perhaps much less dominant?  What is the ratio out there?  (3) If there is dark matter everywhere. Galaxies exist in filaments and walls.  Does dark matter do this? or is it evenly-spread? "
1578,Contradiction of special theory of relativity and quantum mechanics,Why do special theory of relativty (with the core message of E=mc²) and quantum mechanics do not go together? Why is the special theory of relativity in the quantum model not valid? Can anyone list some reasons or explain it on examples?    Edit: The question is based on mixing up something I read.

1580,Is our central black hole actually at the CG of the galaxy?,"It seems fairly certain there is a large black hole, about 25,000 ly from Earth roughly in the center of our galaxy, in the direction of the Sag. A radio source.  • In fact, is it thought to be literally at the center of gravity of our galaxy?  Does we know, or is this uncertain?  • Indeed, do we actually know where the CG of the galaxy is?  I observe that the term ""Galactic Center"" seems to be an astronomical term. (Example.) Can an astronomer tell me: does that term mean what we believe to be the CG, or rather, is it a nominal mapping point?  • If the black hole IS exactly at the CG of the galaxy ... why?  It would seem to me a big BH could form any old place, and perhaps still be orbiting or oscillating the CG - right?  If the SBH is literally the CG of there galaxy, is there a reason for that?  (Like, ""SBH can only form at the CG"" .. or ""stellar collisions can only happen at the CG"" .. or whatever, those are only wild guesses.)  Or indeed, is the SBH the ""main player"" in the galaxy - just as the solar system formed around the sun (so it would be silly to ask ""why is the sun at the center""), did the SBH sort of co-form with the galaxy (or something?)  In any event, is the SBH at the actual CG of our galaxy? Do we know? "
1581,Suns Orbital speed and escape velocity question,"This is a homework question and I don't want an answer but just want to understand what its asking for.  We are given that a star with a mass of x solar masses in our galaxy turns to a supernova and releases y amount of energy. Using this we are asked to calculate the average speed of the ejected mass.   v = sqrt(2*E_k/M) (Kinetic energy equation) gives the average speed.  Finally, the questions asks the following:     Compare  your  result with our Sun’s orbital speed around the centre of the Milky Way galaxy. Where would you expect this material to end up?   Is it asking to solve and check that the average speed > escape velocity if the star was at the same distance from the sun? Or how far from the center of the Galaxy would it end up? "
1582,Can a black hole undergo a Penrose process inside another black hole's ergosphere?,"I recently watched this video on black holes: [website]And that statement should give you an idea of my level of understanding :)  I was wondering if a spinning black hole A could complete a Penrose process through another spinning black hole B's ergosphere. i.e. if it could travel through the ergosphere of another spinning black hole and emerge out of it the other side.  What would happen?  Perhaps this is related to the question of whether black holes can orbit each other (in two or three-body system)?  What happens if black holes orbit each other, but their ergospheres overlap? "

They have also announced a very ambitious program for inter-planetary probes to practically the entire Solar system, to date they've flewn by the NEO Toutatis. The are also building a 500 meter radio telescope super-version of Arecibo.  Will for example US astronomers be able to use that telescope?

1584,Was Milky Way formed after Sagittarius A Explosion?,"Is it possible that most galaxies (and our galaxy) were formed from leftovers of supernova explosions?  In order to have a black hole 4,000,000 x solar mass the initial mass of the star should have been even greater.   So I was thinking, is it possible that after the big bang, gas formed much bigger stars 1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000x bigger than the sun, which later exploded forming:    black holes in the middle of future galaxies Gas, which later created smaller stars, planets, etc.   Am I trying to reinvent a bicycle here?

1585,A strange star-like object,"So it was around 6 AM and i was looking at the sky and there were not many visible stars because the sun was about to rise. There were two stars that were brighter than the others and i was looking at them for about 5 mins. They weren't moving and the space between them seemed very little. Suddenly, one of those stars started moving down in direction towards the horizon and the other remained still. The star continued to go down. In 1 or 2 minutes it went behind the horizon and stopped being visible, while the other was still at the same place like earlier. At first I thought that the moving object was a satellite, but then i realised that a satellite would orbit the earth with constant speed, and the object i saw remained still for atleast 5 mins. So what else can it be??? "

1589,Making sense of the lomb-scargle periodogram,"I am trying to use the periodogram to tell when a signal is periodic or not by following the tutorial for the astropy Lomb-scargle periodogram here.  [website]I simulated some data, one that is a sinusoid (period = 200) and one which is a skew gaussian (i.e, a single transient event). The hope was that periodogram would pick out the period for the periodic object and and give a  period for the transient that would imply a single event occured in the window.   Unfortunately, the results don't make sense at all. I have attached code at the end and the figures generated below. Due to random noise in my simulation, each result is different and I provide two examples of the results below. I use the same method outlined in the link above where we use the function LombScargle.model() on the best fit frequency from frequency[argmax[power]]  The red line is the true function I simulated the data from. The green is the best fit from the periodogram. The right hand plots are the PSD from the periodogram.  Example 1   Here we can see the best fit frequency for the sinusoid (top right plot) picked out is 0.105 (i.e. a period of 9-10 days) which is not near a frequency of 0.05 I'd expect for something with a period of 200 days, yet when I feed this best fit frequency of 0.105 to the lomb-scargle model fitter, a nicely matching periodic curve comes out with a period of 200 days?   This does not make sense.  Example 2    Here I ran the code again and this time the results are switched around? It fit a very large period to the transient so that I can confidently say it is a single transient event yet the sinusoidal fit is terrible. The best frequency is still 0.105 (period=10) yet the lomb-scargle model fitter overlays something that appears to have a period of 60 days which is wrong?  Could I get clarification on if i'm doing something wrong? I've been told the periodogram is the de facto tool for unenvenly sampled data like this yet... the results seem awful half the time.  To clarify my questions   Can it be explained how in the first plot the best-fit frequncy of 0.105 that I feed into the astropy lomb-scargle model fitter somehow creates a correctly matching sinusoid with frequency 0.05?

1590,How has the Earth's orbit changed over hundreds of millions or billion of years?,"First, I know that modeling orbital mechanics of 8 planets is hard, but there are some theories out there, for example, Jupiter is thought to have moved in towards the sun then started moving away.   Article  and Uranus and Neptune may have switched spots Article  Is there any pretty good evidence on how the Earth's orbit has changed over time.   I remember reading some geological evidence that a year used to be longer, implying that the Earth used to be farther form the Sun, but I've since been unable to find that article, and for purposes of this question, lets count a day as 24 hours even though a day used to be quite a bit shorter hundreds of millions or billions of years ago.   - footnote, I've still not been able to find that article but it occurs to me, it could have been counting shorter days, not longer years - so, take that part with a grain of salt.  Are there any good studies out there on how many 24 hour days were in a year, 100, 300, 500, 800 million years ago?  or 1 or 2 billion years ago?  Either geological or orbital modeling?   Preferably something a layman can read, not something written by and for PHDs?  Or any good summaries, also encouraged.    Thanks.  I also found this article, but it seems more theoretical than evidence based.   [website]"
1591,When would we detect a tiny meter size natural satellit in a geostationary orbits?,"A natural, tiny (meters-size, maybe 10.000kg mass) natural satellite could be trapped in a geostationary orbit. I wondered for quite some time:     When and how are we able to detect these satellites?   I assume the distance of 35.700km of way too far for naked eye detection. So the next realistic opportunity would have been Galilei who first used telescopes for scientific observations of the sky. Could he have detected such an object?  Now even if he had enough resolution, he certainly didn't systematically cover the whole 4[tex] of the sky (especially as the satellite could be syncronous with the other side of the earth, and he could never see it).  Then, would it be at the times of Hubble (because of the Mount Wilson Observatory and other similarly powerful telescopes)? Would it at the times when quality equipment for hobby astronomers became cheap and therefore widespread enough (to cover huge areas of the sky)? Or would we - until today - not be able to detect such objects?  To answer this question, one needs to consider both the technical ability as well as the area of the sky that is covered.  "
1592,How Can I Interpolate Ephemerides?,"I have two ephemerides for orbital elements—that is, each contains [tex] (semi-major axis), [tex] (ecc.), [tex] (incl.), [tex] (long. asc. node), [tex] (arg. of peri.), [tex] (time of peri.), [tex] (period), and a timestamp [tex].  I want to compute a new ephemeris at a point somewhere between these two ephemerides.  For example, the timestamp ([tex]) of the new ephemeris can be calculated by a linear interpolation of the start ([tex]) and end ([tex]) ephemerides' times as:$$     t = \text{lerp}(t_0,t_1, x) = t_0 \cdot (1-x) + t_1 \cdot x $$  Unfortunately, I can't seem to get an interpolation for the other parameters that doesn't have discontinuities in it.  My question: how should I be interpolating ephemerides?  Maybe I need to do this through some intermediate parameters, like [tex], [tex], or [tex]?       For example, if I take [tex] from the first ephemeris and lerp everything else, I get a strong discontinuity when mean anomaly is calculated (as [tex]).  I suspect this is because the mean anomaly calculation is only valid at the ephemeris, and as e.g. [tex] changes due to interpolation, [tex] changes erroneously.      Here is an example for Mercury.  The first three ephemerides come from NASA HORIZONS and are correct.  Interpolating the first two ephemerides produces [tex].  However, two seconds later, the interpolation (which is now interpolating from the last two ephemerides) produces [tex].  "
1593,Why are radio telescopes shaped so differently than optical telescopes?,"Why are radio telescopes typically only a dish with a receiver above it, while optical telescopes have a primary, plus secondary and sometimes even a tertiary mirror?  In other words, why do radio telescopes have only one reflector, while optical telescopes have up to three or more?  The same wave phenomena, such as focusing, should apply in both cases. So I don't understand why the geometry would be radically different. You could just replace actual mirrors with a convenient solid, such as plastic, that reflects radio waves just as wells as mirrors reflect optical waves. "
1594,Will the Sun rotate slower in red giant form?,"When the Sun runs out of hydrogen to fuse it will grow bigger in size and my question is does it rotate more slowly, like a spinning ice skater extending their arms to reduce angular velocity?

1595,"In an area with lots of light pollution, which clear sky clock parameter is most important?","I live on the periphery of a large light dome, looking towards the West. I get about 1/3 of the sky towards mountains that is darker. According to ClearDarkSky.com I live in an area with artificial to night sky brightness ratio of about 9.00, Sky Brightness mags / arcsec2 V Band of about 19.5, and Bortle Scale of about 5.  On the Clear Sky Clock (also at ClearDarkSky.com) I see the following sky values:   Cloud Cover Transparence Seeing Darkness   Which of these values is most important in a light polluted area, especially when looking west in my case to the darker sky portion?  I'm thinking it is transparency as low transparency may result in more scattering of light pollution and thus more pollution?  But perhaps moon phase beyond a certain portion matters too, especially if the moon is in the west.  I have a large Dobsonian telescope and wonder which of these is going to have the most beneficial effect when viewing near the city? "
1596,How do black holes lose their mass?,"As I was searching the answer to 'What comes after Black Holes', I found these two threads talking about the same thing  Do black holes die?

The answers here mention that Black holes do die but with time and they ""evaporate""  What do you mean by Evaporation of a Black Hole?  How do these black holes lose their mass? "
1597,"Does Ganymede have a day/night cycle? If so, what does it look like?","Over on the SF &amp; Fantasy Stack, I've asked a question about a curious watch that shows 15 intervals on its watch face instead of the usual 12 hours. That watch belongs to someone living on Ganymede, close to the end of the 21st century.  Why does Jet's old watch show 15 hours?  Does Ganymede have any day/night cycle, or any other cycle, that would explain this curious watch?  In analogy to earth, we should expect a 30-hour Ganymede-day. But Ganymede is in tidal lock, always showing its same side to Jupiter. Also, calculations show that the light reflected by Jupiter pales compared to that of the sun.  So I would assume that Ganymede's day/night cycle is sun based, possibly complicated by passing through Jupiter's shadow.  What do day and night on Ganymede look like? "
1598,Can the Sun pull an iron asteriods in it's orbit into it?,Can our Sun's magnetic field strengthen in any way in a short period? Can the Sun pull anything trapped in close orbit around it? What would happen if an object in orbit passes over a sunspot for example? 
1599,Why one cannot escape from a black hole,"The usual explanation is that escape velocity of a black hole is above speed of light, therefore nothing can escape because nothing can move faster than light.  This is however a fallacy, because escape velocity only pertains to bodies ""without propulsion"", or in other words without any force other than gravity acting on them. As an example I could theoretically escape Earth's gravity at a walking speed, just give me a staircase and I could walk all the way to the Moon. No need to accelerate to 11 km/s at any point.  How does this affect black holes? Why cannot I have a staircase and climb out?  I know the staircase idea must be wrong, but I would like to know why. My guess is that I am applying Newtonian mechanics to a problem which requires general relativity approach, because Newtonian mechanics approximation fails badly around such massive gravity fields?  Anyway, according to Newtonian mechanics one can easily escape a black hole, even if we assume that speed of light cannot be exceeded. "
1600,How to calculate a planet's current position within the solar system,"I'm making an application that needs to calculate a planet's current position within the solar system - I don't want to calculate its position in the sky.

Is there a latitude/longitude coordinate system for the solar system? Everything I've found seems to calculate a planet's position in the sky from the observer's point on earth. "

1602,Does matter accelerate to the speed of light as it approaches the singularity?,"[tex]  If we understand the escape velocity to be the speed needed to escape from the 'surface' of a gravitational object described by the above equation.  It is equally true that the escape velocity is the speed an object pulled from rest will reach when it hits a certain point in the gravitational field.  Since the event horizon is defined as when the escape velocity reaches the speed of light for a black hole, would matter accelerate near the speed of light as it approaches the singularity? Accretion disks are known to move at relativistic speeds near the event horizon, but perhaps oddities occur beyond this point?  The event horizon can be derived from setting the escape velocity of an object to the speed of light, it is a point of no return. I understand there are better definitions, but this is not really germane to the question at hand. How about from the perspective of another in-falling observer? "
1603,What would happen if a body were to fall into a neutron star?,"We know neutron stars as a very massive object with extremely strong gravitational forces that composes mostly of neutrons.

As you might have guessed, I don't have any science background, just asking out of a common man's curiosity, so please be gentle with the jargon you use.   "
1607,calculating stellar visibility,"Please could you let me know a (basic) formula for calculating at what time a star would become visible of an evening in clear weather conditions.  I presume the formula would involve the stars apparent magnitude, the location of the observer, and how far the sun has dipped below the horizon (so, the sky's limiting magnitude).  Working with these three parameters, I guess there must be a simple enough formula, however I cannot find it!  Could you help with this?  For example, assuming clear weather and good eyesight, how could I calculate at what time the star Deneb will become visible on the 1st May 2019 for a rural location?  I am asking this as I want to create an art piece where something happens each time a new star (or stars) becomes visible around twilight time....  Thank you. "

1609,Fate of Jupiter when our sun dies,"   Five billion years from now, the sun will have grown into a red giant star, more than a hundred times larger than its current size.   While this metamorphosis into the giant star will change the solar system, scientists are unsure what will happen to the third rock from the sun.We already know that our sun will be bigger and brighter, so that it will probably destroy any form of life on our planet.    But whether the Earth's rocky core will survive is uncertain.   At the end of its evolution, seven billion years from now, the sun will become a tiny white dwarf star.   (by Leen Decin, professor at the KU Leuven Institute of Astronomy (source))  When our sun runs through its last phase of its life it will expand and tremendous solar flares will flow out of it. Earth will end up getting baked and will lose its atmosphere.  Jupiter is a gas giant planet, a GAS GIANT. So,  What will happen in Jupiter? Will it evolve into a star since it contains hydrogen and helium? How will the atmosphere deal with the extreme heat? "
1610,"If the earth stopped rotating, would we really fly inertially at 1000mph?","I heard this on Prof. Neil Tyson's StarTalk podcast (this episode) and had a question about it. In a Q&amp;A session, a listener had asked what would happen if Superman really did stop the earth from rotating and rotated it in the other direction. Prof. Tyson's response was that if the earth, which is rotating at approx. 1000mph about its axis, is stopped, everything that is not anchored on earth will move the opposite direction at 1000mph and we'd all go crashing into things at that speed.  I suppose that is just simple inertia: if a body moving at 1000mph is stopped abruptly, everything that was moving with it but not attached to it would indeed attempt to continue in the same direction at 1000mph. However, the earth is rotating rather than moving in a straight line. Essentially, gravity is strong enough to ensure that we are not thrown off into space by the centrifugal force from the earth's rotation (we aren't holding on to our dear lives as the earth turns at 1000mph). So in a sense, aren't we anchored to earth by gravity? And therefore, doesn't it mean that if the earth stopped abruptly, we'd just stop with it? (I'm thinking of say a centrifuge with test tubes attached to it. Though as I think about this, I feel that we'd sway at the point of attachment instead of stand still, were the earth to stop).  Can someone help resolve this for me? "

1616,"We know what a nova is, but how?","I work with astrophysicists and require some basic knowledge of many astronomical sources, however research priorities often demand that most of human knowledge on a subject be taken for granted.  I am currently researching galactic novae, and I find it relevant to summarize their history briefly when presenting my research to certain audiences. Unfortunately, I am unable to find any source material which describes how we know one key aspect of the events: that they are an accreting white dwarf in a stellar binary. This fact appears to be so well founded that no scientific paper feels obligated to cite it when stated, but basic resources like astronomical encyclopedia also make no reference that I've seen.  How do we know that novae are binary systems?  E.g., have follow-up observations clearly identified the white dwarf and its companion? Or do other astronomical measurements strongly confirm this binary hypothesis (and make it all but obviously true)? I apologize if it's as simple as ""someone looked through a telescope, and it was pretty obvious"" -- in my experience no revelation in astrophysics is nearly so simple, but certainly this could be the case. "
1617,"A clock travelling ""faster than the speed of light""","When a clock travels close to the speed of light as observed by us, it should tick slower.  Does this mean that, when using this clock to measure a second - it could travel much more than 300 000 km during a second? In fact, this clock could travel infinitely fast when viewed only from its own perspective?  Does this imply that if I traveled on a space ship, at the speed of 99 % of light, I would age 4 years, but could reach a destination perhaps 400 light years away?   My friends and family on earth would have perished, but the people I saw on the destination planet as I started my journey will have aged only 4 years as well.  If the last assumption is correct; it means that we could watch a launching space ship at alpha centauri, it could arrive here in just 3-4 days - appearing to travel much faster than the speed of light, without breaking the laws of relativity. We would just say that it was relativistic blue shift that made it seem to travel faster than the speed of light. "
1618,Is it possible to image a meteor so the rock is visible?,"I was wondering what one would see if they were to look through a telescope tracking a meteor as it shot through the sky. Technology aside, would one be able to see the object tumbling or would it always be obscured by the light/dust/plasma?  Basically would there be any advantage to getting a high shutter-speed video with high magnification tracking the leading edge of a meteor or would it not offer any greater detail than just a bright streak in the sky?

1620,Why do planets and satellites in the Solar system look so wildly different if they came from more or less the same matter?,"First, the planets. We have Mercury, which is rocky, no atmosphere. But then we have Venus, which is completely different: thick atmosphere, very hot, geologically active. Then Earth - blue, full of water. Mars, the opposite: red like nothing else. Jupiter and Saturn are fairly similar. Then Uranus and Neptune, fairly similar but still differ in color between each other and also totally different in color than the two gas giants.    On the other hand: satellites. Let's analyze satellites of Jupiter and Saturn.    Ganymede and Callisto fairly similar, but then Europe, total opposite: completely icy. And then Io, again something completely different: strikingly yellow.  Saturn's moons: mostly rocky, but then, something completely different: Titan, with a thick atmosphere like no other satellite and oceans of liquid methane.  If during the formation of the Solar system there was a protoplanetary disk of matter, wouldn't it be pretty homogenous and therefore give rise to similarly looking planets? I understand that gas giants can't look the same as rocky planets, but why are there differences even between similarly sized rocky planets? Granted, there are wildly different temperatures throughout the Solar system, depending on the distance from the Sun, which probably explain some of the differences.   But then what I especially don't understand are the differences between the satellites. If say Jupiter had a disk of matter orbiting it, which eventually formed into satellites, wouldn't at least that ""local"" disk around a planet be fairly homogenous? But nevertheless it developed into wildly different satellites. For example, how did the ""yellowy"" thing get concentrated on Io, and not equally distributed on all the Jupiter's moons? "

1623,Understanding expected TESS data structure,"I'm interested in trying to use the data that will be returned by TESS to apply some machine learning/computer sciences concepts. I'm not sure yet what I want to try to do with it (though I have some ideas - see end comments). This because I don't really understand the data structure it will be using.   So essentially I would like to first some help to get a high-level view of how the TESS data is structured. Then a bit of guidance as to how I could visualize it/get started with some basic example   Additional info/what I know at this point  I've checked out the MAST page. It details what type of FITS documents will be returned.  I have downloaded samples of some of these data products and I see they all come in FITS format. On Ubuntu, you can open that in Aladin. However Aladin in itself is a fairly involved piece of software. Do I need Aladin for this, or are there simple alternatives to just view the data quickly to help get a feel for what it means? In other words what kind of navigator do you use for FITS files?  I'm pretty new to astronomy - I'm coming at this rather from a computer science perspective. Some basic suggestions as to what kind of observation an amateur astronomer might want to look at would be welcomed if you have some.  The data linked above (MAST page) are simulated data (real data will only be available in a couple months). This is fine - mostly interested in being functional with the data when they arrive.  Data analysis ideas:   Using kmeans or similar to try to extract  what are some of the ""typical"" transit light curves   Generating those transit light curves from the raw data, say from a target pixel   "
1624,location of the sun on the celestial sphere,"The Sun, in its apparent motion along the ecliptic through the year, passes over the background of distant stars. However, given that we can't observe those stars due to the brightness of the Sun, how were the ancient astronomers able to identify which star the Sun appears to be over or near to?  The only possible explanation I can come up with is that they observed the morning sky just before dawn (while stars were still visible) or the night sky just after sunset and so they couldn't really identify the precise location of the Sun on the celestial sphere but they could describe its position in rather general terms, which is why they might say, e.g. that the Sun is in the constellation of the Capricorn. Am I missing something? "
1625,Various moon orbits,"Orbits can follow certain patterns, as I am aware.  Some include a circular orbit around the bulk of the planet, a polar orbit spinning about the pole...  What I'd like to know, for a planet with two moons (one large one in a circular orbit at the equator, more or less), could the smaller moon, at a larger range but higher velocity, be pulled into an orbit that looks like a polar orbit for part of it's cycle, then transition towards a circular one before ""flipping"" back towards a polar orbit on the opposing pole, dancing between the three states either in sequence or seemingly at random as the smaller moon approaches certain criteria, being tugged on by the planet, the larger moon, the sun, maybe other planets in the system.  Is this feasible, or does it break the laws of orbital dynamics to have such a situation occur?  This is for a story I am writing centered on a planet other than Earth, but is relatively Earth-like in it's properties.  Size and density the same as Earth.  Orbit a bit tighter and faster than Earth's in relation to it's sun.  The smaller moon is perhaps 200 square miles in surface area, tidally locked stone and ice.  The larger is perhaps 42 million square miles in surface area.  Any thoughts on this?  The basic idea is that this smaller moon, Eamor, is going to be seen in the night's sky almost like a star to the naked eye, racing across the skies as if scared of it's own shadow, sometimes disappearing under the horizon only to dart back up again.  Hence the name, which means, in the language of one culture on the planet, ""one who is terrified"". "
1626,Isn't it likely that most extra solar planets don't transit their star in line with the Earth?,"In which case, for every planet that we detect, there should be significantly more that we can't detect because they don't transit in line with the Earth and, thus, are invisible.  Now, I suppose that we can reasonably assume that most planets in a given solar system orbit in a fairly well defined plane, so if we detect one planet then there are probably others in the same plane.  But, if we have detected no planets in a system, isn't it simply more likely that the planets are orbiting in a plane that doesn't bisect the Earth?  If that is the case, since there is such a tiny degree of variation that would allow a transit to be observed, shouldn't there be a huge number of planets that are not visible because the inclination of their orbital plane is something other than 0 (with respect to the Earth)? "
1627,"H-R diagram, Double stars","Can someone help me? I have a case, like, we have H-R diagram and two stars on it. One of them is a blue star on main sequence, another is a red giant. They have equal luminosity. If they are in a double star system and seen from Earh as one star, then where on the diagram should I place this star? What luminosity amd temperature will it have?  Maybe I should sum up their luminosity and then, using Stefan Boltzmann law, calculate the temperature? But does the law work for red giants? And can I sum the luminosity? "
1628,"When will the next transit of Earth be visible from Mars? Was the last one really on May 11, 1984?","@PM2Ring's comment mentions the story Transit of Earth written by the famous British science fiction writer, science writer and futurist,3 inventor, undersea explorer, television series host, Fellow of the Royal Astronomical Society and Commander of the Order of the British Empire and celebrated polymath Arthur C. Clarke in which the character's task is to record a transit of the Earth across the Sun's disk as seen from Mars.  According to the story, this happens on May 11, 1984.  The story also mentions that the previous occurrence would have been in 1905, and the following one would be 100 years following this one, presumably in 2084.     The radio has just printed a message from Earth, reminding me the transit starts in two hours, as if I’m likely to forget, when four men have already died so that I can be the first human being to see it, and the only one, for exactly a hundred years.      It isn’t often that Sun, Earth and Mars line up neatly like this. The last time was in 1905, when poor old Lowell was still writing his beautiful nonsense about the canals and the great dying civilization that built them.   Question: Were there in fact transits of the Earth as seen from Mars on these dates (in 1905, on 11-May-1984, and in 2084)? If they do occur at roughly 100 year intervals as suggested, there may in fact be people on Mars to see the next one presuming that Sir Clarke did his maths right (did he ever not?). On what day would that be?    You can listen to Sir Clarke read the story himself in the YouTube video 'Transit Of Earth' by Arthur C. Clarke read by himself. You can also listen here: [website]"

1630,How accurate are NASA's eclipse predictions?,"NASA's predictions for the August 2017 solar eclipse show that about half of Kansas City will see a total eclipse and the other half won't (they'll just see a ""near"" total eclipse, perhaps even Bailey's Beads?).  I thought this would be a great way of testing how accurate NASA's eclipse path prediction is: have people in Kansas City report, with location, whether they saw a total eclipse or not (of course, many people in Kansas City will probably head into the total eclipse zone just to see it, but hopefully few will remain outside it).  It then occurred to me that someone must've already done this for previous eclipses (I know it's done for lunar occultations of other stars).  However, googling only tells me that NASA's 2017 path predictions are more accurate than ever before, but not actually HOW accurate they are.  Where can I find data about accuracy of eclipse predictions? "

1633,"Why is the speed of light 299,792,458 meters/sec?","Ok, I am majoring in physics (4th year) and I never understood this fundamental (kinda) question. Maybe I haven't explored it enough.  For example, why does it take 8min20sec for the light from the sun to get to us? I know the answer to this question on a 'surface' scale. The sun is 1AU away, c=3E8 m/s, and d=v/t to get approx 8 min 20 sec.   my question is on a deeper level.   Say you could ""ride a photon"" I KNOW THIS IS IMPOSSIBLE, but just say you could. Or a better question: what does a photon experience? The photon, as per my understanding, would leave the sun and (if it is on the right trajectory) hit the Earth instantaneously. A photon leaving Alpha Centauri would see the universe all at once, in a infinitesimal small unit of time (if directed out to space).   If a photon sees everything all at once, why do we perceive it to have a speed? I am sure this has something to do with frames of reference, special relatively, Lorentz transforms? but just seems strange. why is the speed of light finite to us... if it was infinite would this be problematic?  "
1634,Trisolar syzygy and it's effects on the planet,"Slightly spoilers here, but in the novel The Three-Body Problem, there's a scene in which Civilization #184 is destroyed by the stacked gravitational attraction of the planet's (aptly named Trisolaris) three suns.   This destruction is portrayed as things (like a sword) suddenly getting lighter, and people and buildings starting to float up in the air, as the atmosphere of the planet is being sucked into the three aligned suns. This is explained as being a ""Trisolar Syzygy"".  However, I don't understand how that is possible. As I understand it, a syzygy happens in any sort of gravitational alignment of some astronomical bodies, and it's apparently what generates the tidal variation on the earth from the moon's orbit. But would the tidal forces be enough to cause this effect?   In the novel, the planet is in the Alpha Centauri system, which may have a planet in the habitable zone, and is an actual trinary system. Could such an astronomical event actually cause some effect like that in this situation?  I'm asking this here because I thought it wouldn't fit in the Science Fiction Q&amp;A, as I'm more interested in the astronomical side of it, but I'd appreciate a pointer if I don't need to ask this here.

1636,Gaia Gbp - Grp: why does it get larger as star gets redder?,"As an enthusiastic amateur scientist, I'm plowing my way through a cool Gaia DR2-based paper, ""An Empirical Measurement of the Initial-Final Mass Relation with Gaia White Dwarfs"". I'm doing all right, but have hit a roadblock: understanding the meaning of the stellar color value GBP - GRP.  GBP is the blue photometry value, and GRP is the red photometry value, so GBP - GRP is the difference between the two, giving a number broadly encoding the star's color. Here's a graph from the paper that uses this value:    It's a graph of white dwarf (""WD"") color versus absolute magnitude. On the left, the absolute magnitude MG increases (downwards) as the star grows dimmer, and across the bottom the color GBP - GRP increases (rightwards) as the star grows redder. Hence the slope of the curve; as a WD cools, it gets smoothly dimmer and redder.  But wait! as a star gets redder, the the ""blue"" brightness should become relatively smaller than the ""red"" brightness, right? So, the GBP - GRP value should get smaller and smaller, right? But that's the opposite of what this graph (and other graphs in the paper) apparently shows.  Should GBP - GRP get larger as a star cools and gets redder? Where am I confused? (I'm assuming the professionals aren't all confused...) "

1639,Implementation of formulae for Meeus for the Moon,"With Astronomical Algorithms by J. Meeus (1998) I have obtained the relevant illuminated fraction of the disk and position angle.  But they're numbers (all Greek to me!) I know, Meeus explains that they're ratios of the lengths of the illuminated limb and areas.  Okay, so I have a ratio.  How do I implement that together with the position angle to work out the direction of the illuminated limb and the amount illuminated?  I'm assuming that the ratio 1.0 is totally illuminated (i.e. Full Moon) and 0.0 is nothing (i.e. New Moon).  and then there is the position angle, I'm assuming that the direction in degrees is starting at 0 pointing upwards.  Is that the crescent shape direction i.e. the horns are pointing away from the directional angle?  I would like to be able plot this so that I can show visually the moon's illuminated fraction and direction for any day in any given year.  As I said, I have the numbers, I'm trying to translate that into a more visually appealling and meaningful result.  Meeus says this is the selenocentric elongation of the Earth from the Sun (Phase Angle) - i.     the formula for illuminated fraction k is:  k = ( 1 + cos i ) / 2  tan i = (R sin l) / (D - (R cos l))  R = distance Earth-Sun D = distance Earth-Moon l = geocentric elongation  Meeus calls k the ratio of the lengths BC:AC the same as the ratio of the areas: NBSC:NASC  Where   "
1640,Very near GAIA DR2 sources - has Proxima Centauri been dethroned?,"I made an extract of GAIA DR2 data for parallaxes greater than 500mas. Surprisingly I see a very significant number of sources with parallax greater that 1000, making them much closer than Proxima. This should lead to excited newspaper headlines, but i haven't seen those yet... Am I missing something?  You can see my extract of data here:  [website]Some GAIA source_id rows to look at include:  4039503676370417664  4042946384760661504  4042338732771057920  4046453826887613696  But there are many more. The closest source I find is 4062964299525805952 with  parallax of 1851mas. It has a phot_g_mean_mag of 19.63355... Would I be right in assuming this is a brown dwarf?  Another thing I note is that there is a surge of vmag 19/20 sources within 10 parsecs. These are obviously so faint GAIA doe not detect similar sources beyond 10 parsecs. To give some numbers I count 1722 sources (most mag 19/20) within 10 parsecs and only 606 sources in a shell of equal volume beyond that. Again, would these all be (a very large number of) brown dwarfs? "

Or are they using these characteristics already?  NOTE: Answers can be theoretical as well! "
1649,Why do we use solar filters instead of simply reducing aperture of the telescope?,"Everywhere I read that to view the Sun in the telescope, one has to use a solar filter. The filter must be handled carefully to avoid any holes in it and even mustn't be stretched so as to avoid reducing its reflectivity in some spots. Otherwise it becomes dangerous due to possibility of overexposing/burning observer's retina.  But, if all we need is to reduce illuminance, and covering part of the telescope's aperture won't obscure the image (since the aperture is far from being in focus), why not simply reduce the aperture to a very small hole? Photo cameras do this all the time, why wouldn't this work for telescopes? Or does a solar filter block IR/UV light, in addition to reducing visible illuminance? "

1651,How much do starlight and artificial light illuminate the Moon?,"The Moon receives most of its light from the Sun, either directly through sunlight or indirectly through Earthshine. However, there are many other dimmer sources of illumination.    Starlight. This is probably the most important one. Under exceptional conditions, it creates shadows here on Earth. Artificial light. Mostly city lights and gas flares. Meteorological activity. Lightning storms on Earth and other planets are visible from space, and here on Earth, they can trigger other sources of light such as firestorms. Bioluminescence. Light-emitting microorganisms are bright enough and numerous enough to be seen from space. Transient bright lights. Events such as supernovas and asteroid impacts are rare, but when they happen, they are a significant source of illumination. Over long timescales, for example a billion years, this may be the biggest contributor of non-solar light.   How much do these light sources illuminate the Moon? If there was no Sun, could we still see the Moon with these lights? And of the three Earth-based sources (artificial light, meteorological activity, bioluminescence), which one illuminates the best?

What are the concrete technical arguments, ideas, or hints that this relationship should hold for our dS universe too? What work has already been done on this? "
1653,Confirm: We can only notice planets if their orbit passes in front of their star and our view,If we can tell a planet exists by the dimming of the brightness of a star when it passes in front of our view of the star does that mean we cannot see a planet if it does not cross in front of our view?   If planet of a distance star goes around the star rather than in front of it than we cannot see that planet. Correct?  
1654,Was time different before the great inflation?,"In time different during the first second after Big Bang than it is now? Inflation had a dramatic effect on space, and spacetime is one thing. Was the properties of time affected too? Curved spacetime around black holes cause funny effects for outside observers, infalling objects appear to never reachthe event horizon. The very early universe was even denser. When we talk about the first second, are such effects accounted for? "
1655,Why haven't Earth and Venus got any tiny moons? Or have they?,"Why haven't some meteoroids gotten caught in Earth's or Venus' orbit?  AFAIK most meteors are tiny fragments from comets. Shouldn't some comet tail sometime have passed Earth orbit at velocities suitable for our planet to capture such fragements? And 100 000s of asteroids have been detected. Why haven't the inner planets gotten asteroid like moons like the outer planets have? The asteroid belt isn't too far away.  Earth's large Luna might clean them away, but that won't explain Venus' lack of tiny moons. "
1656,How could universe inflate itself out of the very dense and curved early spacetime? Could it happen in a black hole too?,"Wasn't spacetime as much curved as a black hole directly after Big Bang, because mass was so densly packed?

Then I read a recent Snapple bottle cap that stated our Sun is really white.  I read it again and chuckled: is it already a White dwarf star at this point?  I take it that the original color of the star happens to be white.  How will we know when the Sun will become a White dwarf and increase in size the engulf the Earth?

As far as I understand everything we can see about universe is the past, right?  I mean all the galaxies and known stars are many light years away so we have no way to knowing if they still exist, so pretty much we don't know anything about present state of the universe, galaxies and stars. Am I right?  That said, all of the facts are said in present tense like ""There are billions of galaxies"" or ""there are black holes"", but in fact, they WERE, because we don't know if they exist now. "

1664,Books describing first-hand experience of astrophysicists finding planets without skipping actual maths,"Are there good references of astronomical texts where we get a first-hand experience of astronomers uncovering astronomical gems using maths alone and not using observation. Observation may have been used later to validate the result.  In this book, there are several examples of astronomical jewels that were uncovered by the professionals. However the book shies away from describing the actual maths that aided the astrophysicists to make their conclusions and predictions that were later confirmed by experimenters.   However, how does a professional astronomer come to conclusions that there must be one more planet at so and so location? Are there books that uncover the exact line of thinking and maths that is involved  behind the works of the professionals?  I am not looking for a book which solves a toy problem rigorously using Newton's laws and then concludes that the 21st century astronomers use similar techniques at grander scales in their works. Though this is what is happening, i am looking for a more transparent description of how the pioneer discoverers make astronomical predictions with surety. The ideal place to look would be the research papers of these pioneers but is there a book that does that for many such achievements? "

1668,Can someone explain a Geostationary Orbit in a simpler way?,"According to Wikipedia (link),  a geostationary orbit, geostationary Earth orbit or geosynchronous equatorial orbit (GEO), is a circular orbit 35,786 kilometres (22,236 mi) above the Earth's equator and following the direction of the Earth's rotation. An object in such an orbit has an orbital period equal to the Earth's rotational period (one sidereal day), and thus appears motionless, at a fixed position in the sky, to ground observers.  My question is then couldn't any orbit be a GEO? I mean, what about a satellite in an orbit that's say 70,000km, if the angular speed of the satellite was the same as the earth's rotation such that it always stayed in a fixed position when observed from the Earth, then isn't that a GEO orbit as well?

1669,Why are distant galaxies not visible in the observable Universe?,"Assuming that the Universe is and has been expanding ever since its creation (Big Bang theory), the galaxies that are now at the 'edge' (not visible theoretically) must have been (at some point in time) at a place around where the Earth is at now.  If it is assumed to be true, then the photons emitted by these galaxies from this point onwards should be around for us to see these galaxies (and even the first light emerged from the Big Bang must be visible).  Then why is the observable so small? It should depend upon the direction in which we look. That is, if we look in the direction of the center of the expanding sphere, it should be a small observable universe. If we train our telesopes in 'exactly' opposite direction of the center, it should be 'fully' observable.  Does it work this way? Or are my basics wrong? "

I have read some things about asteroid mining in the past and I think it's a really interesting topic, as it opens up a lot of possibilities.  But one thing came to my mind. Humans tend to pushing things a little too far sometimes when we want to reach a goal. So, imagine, we are getting really good at off-earth mining at a larger scale and in a larger timespan, we continue to mine thousands and thousands of asteroids. Wouldn't that affect the gravitational balance of our star system at some point, or is the gravitational influence of an asteroid belt negligible? I am talking about extreme examples, like removing nearly the whole asteroid belt beyond Mars. Also, what would happen to all the stuff we don't need from an asteroid?  I'm sure I'm not the first one who thinks of something like this, but I found nothing about this particular topic. "

They clearly would have come across this problem along time ago and the videos of UFO's levitating and vectoring themselves demonstrates they operate on similar applied electromagnetic forces that the celestial bodies use to maneuver themselves around in solar systems. Couldn't they maneuver meteors, asteroids, possibly even speed the advance of collisions developing protoplanets and move moons into orbits with planets?

Are there any publicly available tables that do go back to 1587? If not, how exactly could I go about calculating the answer for myself?

I was riding my bike home yesterday on a clear winter night, and became confused on why that could be. What mechanism is responsible for making the edge brighter than the dark part of the moon? Or is it my brain trying to make a circle?  Here's an example of what I mean. "
1680,Temperature of the intracluster medium (ICM),"I've read once in an article that the temperature of the medium within galaxy clusters (the intracluster medium or ICM) is extremely high.    What does that temperature really mean? Particle velocity?  Why is that so? Is that medium the ""Void""?  Is it in conflict with the CMB temperature (that's about 3 K)?  "
1681,What would the CMB look like somewhere else in the universe?,"An answer to a question on Worldbuilding.SE opined that if you were suddenly transported an unknown distance and direction away by magic you could use the Cosmic Microwave Background to determine your position relative to the Earth.  This lead me to wonder, what does the CMB look like at different positions in the universe? Can changes in how the CMB looks be used to determine your position, direction, or velocity relative to Earth? "
1682,"Rotational speeds of the material forming planets should increase, not decrease",We know that planets form as a result of gaseous material revolving around a center of mass that froze to form planets. However shouldn't the angular speed of that matter increase as they go closer to the center to maintain the angular momentum?   Why then the average rotational period of the external planets are faster than that for the terrestrial planets? 
1683,When black holes forms out of a supernova do they have a very high velocity?,When black holes forms out of a supernova do they have a very high velocity ?? Or do they remains at the position of parent star ?? 
1684,"If you're near a black hole and your time is slowed down, would a supernova be observable to both you and someone outside of the blackhole's pull?","Let's say that Person A is on a planet orbiting a black hole (like the one from Interstellar) and time is slowed for Person A. Person B is back home on Earth. Now let's say a supernova happens and it's possible for both parties to see it happen at the same time (ignoring the time it would take for the light to get there). Would Person A see the supernova at the same time as Person B? And if so, if Person A is in 1,000 B.C. and Person B is in 2,000 A.D, would the supernova then happen at two different times at the same time? "
1685,Can there be a 2nd possibility deduced from the fact that galaxies are moving away from us?,"I just read that according to the BBT the universe is expanding. This is evident from the fact that distant stars (and galaxies) are moving away from us. But it could also happen that the universe is in fact shrinking to a very small point and we being far away from the point are experiencing its pull less than those that are near it. It may be like a race where a very fast (in 1st place) , a moderately fast (in 2nd place) and a slow car (at last) are racing . To the moderately fast car it would seem that the other two are moving away from it,but actually they all are moving towards the same point -the end. So it may happen that earth is like the moderately fast car moving towards the collapse point at a different relative speed. Is this proposition possible? If not,why? "
1686,Are black holes orbiting around each other?,"Obviously, bodies with low gravity force orbit around another one with higher gravity force, if they are close enough to each other.   Is it true also for objects like black holes? Are they even able to be moved by another force? "
1687,Official Definition of Satellite?,"So I had an argument with a friend, which was about whether the Moon is a planet or a satellite.  IAU 2006 Resolution B5 gives definitions on what it is to be a planet, but there is a vagueness, as I perceived, is that it does not define satellites, while using it to define dwarf planets.  There is a supplementary Q&amp;A sheet, and it uses the barycenter to define a satellite, but it is implied, not explicitly defined.  My questions follow:   Should the supplementary Q&amp;A sheet considered as legitimate official definitions, or should it be considered as a one way of interpreting the Resolution B5? If Q&amp;A is legitimate, then why is the definition of the satellite is not included in the Resolution B5? If not, is the official definition of the satellite nonexistent currently? Are there any source or archive of the official or widely accepted definitions of glossaries in the fields of astronomy?  "
1688,Can stellar black holes cancel each other?,Hypothetical question: when a pair of identical stellar black holes are very close to one another wouldn't the side facing each other experience lower gravitational force? How is this logic un/sound? 
1689,Do stars of a galaxy change their positions relatively to each other?,"Complete astronomy noob over here who would be happy if he get a simple answer (and who is also aware that this may be not possible)...  I've learned from a tv documentary that the stars at the edge of the galaxy are not traveling more slowely than the ones closer to the center.   Does this also mean that all stars in a galaxy do not change their positions relatively to each other?   To put it simply: If I note the relative position of a star compared to our sun, and then do it again 10 (100 / 1000) years later: Are the coordinates of that star identical or will the star be in a different relative position?  I would assume that the star is in a completely different (relative) place given the speed star systems are travelling because the galaxy is rotating AND the ""fact"" (read: I don't know if this is really a fact) that the solar system is oscillating through the galactic plane.  "
1690,What is the closest an asteroid or comet has passed the Sun and survived?,"After SOHO began watching the Sun from space with its coronagraphs 24/7 it was discovered that there are comets passing very close to the Sun quite regularly, and while some are destroyed, some are seen to emerge and continue on.  From these observations and from all other comet and asteroid observations there should be quite a collection of objects whose orbits take them very close to the Sun.  Is there any way to find out What is the closest an asteroid or comet has passed the Sun and survived?    Here is a GIF I made for this answer also used in this answer. In addition to some comets you can see Venus on its approach to occultation by the Sun in 2016. Seeing the Pleiades so close to the Sun is exciting as well!     These LASCO C3 images from SOHO were downloaded sohodata.nascom.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/data_query. The square frame is about 15.9 degrees wide.        "
1691,Tests for code that computes two-point correlation function of galaxies,"I'm currently writing a code to compute the two-point correlation function of a set of galaxies. As I work with a loooot of galaxies, it was suggested to me not to do it in real space, but to compute the power spectrum in Fourier space and get the correlation from the power spectrum, as is explained e.g. in appendix B in this paper (arXiv:1507.01948).  What I need are some very simple test cases with known results to test my code at each step in order to ensure that I really get what I want. Can anybody point me to any such simple tests? Or at least to a already existing code (preferably in Python or Fortran) that does exactly this, so I can cross-compare the results? "
1692,Is there an oxide layer on aluminum reflectors for telescopes?,"I was watching a Nottingham Science video linked here (periodic videos) and they mention modern reflectors are made of aluminum.   I can understand why mirrors are preferred over lenses, but what inhibits the aluminum oxide coating that would naturally form on the surface of the mirror? Why do they work so well? "
1693,Is there going to be a really bad Solar Storm in 2014?,"Here are some Articles I've found.  Is it true? If it is, How big could it be?, what might be possible or will be possible?, what will happen? "
1694,Speed of light through the ISM and Wavelength,"Articles written about fast radio bursts describe the signal's short-wavelength components arriving before its longer-wavelength components, suggesting energy-dependent time delays in the interstellar medium (ex. [website]Why are lower-energy signals slowed slightly more than higher-energy signals when passing through clouds of electrons? Also, how do we know about this slowing effect if it appears to be so small (what objects or events have exhibited the time difference)?  My first-order logic guessed that higher energy radiation is slowed more, remembering the mnemonic ""Blue bends best"" from optics. I assume these intergalactic clouds behave quite differently from a solid prism. "
1695,What's a good step up from 7x50 binoculars?,"I own a Nikon OceanPro 7x50 pair of binoculars, but I find that when I look at the moon, I would like more magnification.  My requirements are:   costs less than $400 weighs less than 10kg the length is less than 1-2 feet much higher maginification than 7x (I already have a pair of 7x binoculars, as I said) at least an 100mm objective I (I already have a device with a 50mm objective)   What kind of device should I go for? A spotting scope? Binoculars? A telescope of some kind?  Ideally, I'd go for binoculars, so that I can see with both eyes, but I'm told binoculars don't come with objectives larger than 100mm, for my budget.  I could buy a spotting scope, like this, but Wikipedia says that spotting scopes are not designed for astronomy.  I live in an apartment, so I can't use a big, heavy telescope, like a 4-feet 20kg thing. I don't have room in my apartment for such a big telescope, and I can't carry it over the threshold into the balcony.  So, what kind of device should I consider, and what are the tradeoffs? What kind of astronomical objects will I be able to see? "
1696,What will happen to the shape of a galaxy when a super massive black hole lying in its center dies(evaporates out)?,"What's at the Center of the Milky Way?  In this article it is said that a supermassive black hole lies in the center of milky way galaxy.     At its center, surrounded by 200-400 billion stars and undetectable to the human eye and by direct measurements, lies a supermassive black hole called Sagittarius A*, or Sgr A* for short.   The Milky Way has the shape of a spiral and rotates around its center, with long curling arms surrounding a slightly bulging disk. It's on one of these arms close to the center that the sun and Earth are located. Scientists estimate that the galactic center and Sgr A* are around 25,000 to 28,000 light-years away from us. The entire galaxy is around 100,000 light-years across.   We revolve around the center every 250 million years.Presumbably we rotate beacuse of the BH.  When the black hole dies in our galaxy will we be thrown out of the revolving orbit?  The shape of the galaxy is expected to change right?It will be some irregular shape not spherical? "
1697,which pulsar has the longest spin period so far?,"Vela X-1 has a 283s spin period, while this one may have a 2.7hr spin period. However neither of them is included in ATNF catalog. They are not included in [tex] diagram either. The longest period is just about 10s in this diagram.  My question is since Vela X-1 is definitely a pulsar, why is it not accepted?  Which one has the longest spin period so far?    When this diagram is mentioned in textbooks, we do not say which kind of pulsars are included at all. Why?  [tex] diagram only shows radio pulsars?  no! you can see magnetars,radio quiet pulsars and pulsars which are only active in [tex]  Except magnetars, there are no single pulsars only pulse in X-ray band?  If a pulsar pulses in X-ray band, that does not necessarily mean it is an X-ray pulsar? Only pulsars in binaries and accretion-powered pulsars could be called X-ray pulsars? They should be radio-quiet?  In binaries, there are no pulsars which pulse in radio and x-ray band simultaneously? "
1698,Why do neutron stars collide instead of just revolving around each other like planets revolve around the Sun?,"We know about events like two neutron star colliding and resulting in a black hole, also collision of black holes, and collision of galaxies. But we never see a satellite such as a moon colliding with a planet, or a planet colliding with a star, or an artificial satellite colliding with Earth.  Can't such celestial bodies (like black holes or neutron stars) remain revolving each other? What makes them collide? Is anything other than gravity responsible for this? "
1699,How many nested stable (1 Mio years) orbits are theoretically possible?,"If we look at our solar system we have the sun which has planet orbits and planets have moon orbits.  If we look at the possible size difference from hypergiants to small asteroids why shouldn't it be possible to nest orbits to an astounding degree: supergiant orbit a hypergiant, star orbits supergiant and so on ?  My first guess is that the size and distance must be so small in contrast to the primary that the gravitational gradient of the primary does not cause too much disturbance, but it should be possible.  Has anyone tried to find it out with celestial mechanics ? While it may be completely theoretical, it is IMHO a solid question and it would be nice to find out how deep celestial bodies can be nested and how it limits stability.  Some conditions:   The orbits should be (very probably) stable for one million years. Hypergiants are burning fast, so I limit the stability for a relative short timeframe. The barycenter of both satellite and its primary are inside the primary. No double system. The first primary should be a star, not a black hole or a neutron star.  "
1700,How many actual stars are Polaris?,"I am getting conflicting accounts everywhere. I heard astronomers saying Polaris is a 3-star system. Some say they are binary but are optical-doubled with a 3rd.  Phil Plait a renowned astronomer wrote in his book Bad Astronomy that Polaris is sextuple star system.     The above text reads      ... but due to its proximity to the NCP it has taken on the popular name of Polaris. The star itself is actually rather interesting; it's really a multiple star consisting of at least six stars in orbit around each other.   While in his Crash Course Astronomy Series He said Polaris was a Pentuple star system.  Now, I am not saying Phil is doing anything wrong. I am actually a fan of him, enjoyed reading the books he authored. He may have said one or the other by mistake. I tried asking him this question, it does not look like there is an effective way to submit him an Errata or ask him questions like these.  So my question is, how many stars are Polaris and are they all gravitationally bound to each other or some of them are just Optically grouped? "
1701,What's the origin and culture of funny astronomical terminology?,"I'm not in the industry myself, but as an interested member of the public the terminology of astronomy seems a bit funny. Astronomers who today talk publicly about the interstellar medium say that the solar system is in the ""local fluff"" inside the ""local bubble"" near a ""local chimney"". Cosmology uses a term like ""the dark ages"" to describe an era in the history of the phenomena they study. But geologists instead prefer to use terms like ""cenozoic"" to name a period. Early on, astronomers also used pompous words and names from antique languages.    Was ""Big Bang"" (coined in 1949, I think) the term which started off this fluffy bubble blob bang type of terminology? Or were there precursors? Is there a connection to sci-fi literature? Are the ""blobby bang fluff"" words just a mass media (""reach out"") construction which professional astronomers don't use at all even as quick references in conversations with colleagues?  "
1702,How can they tell no asteriods will hit earth in the next hundreds years?,"I have been thinking about this question :     How can they tell no asteroids (big enough to create damage) will hit earth in the next few hundred years?   Because, so far, we were unable to get a clear and nice view of a planet of the solar system planet which is not that big, but still bigger than an asteroid. So how can they tell that nothing from the immensity of the Galaxy and Universe, bigger than a few yards, will cross our path and hit us within the next 100 years?   We all remember Chelyabinsk meteor in 2013, or whatever how they called that thing. They never saw that coming but it still caused damage and it was only few meters (± 20 meters according to that page Wiki link), Arround 1,500 injuries and ± 7200 damaged buildings... It's hard to believe that they know how to see something not so much wider than 20 metres wide outside of our solar system. "

They are thought to originate as debris from sun-grazing comets.   It has one reference      ""Exploding Lunar Eclipse"", an article about an attempt to observe Helion meteoroids, Science@NASA, August 27, 2007.   but that link is now dead.   Was NASA's 2007 attempt to see meteoroids coming from a solar eclipse successful? What instruments were used? Has it been attempted again since?  "
1705,Could this three moons system be stable?,"In my fictional world I have selected all parameters to maximize the Hills Sphere of my planet. The planet has three times Earth's mass and it is located in 2 AU from its star that's 1.4 times more massive than our Sun. I assume that there are more planets on the system but in such way to have minimum interaction with my planet.  I want to have three  moons on a 1:2:4 resonance. I also want:   the first one to be as large as our moon to the sky the second 1.5 times larger and the third, half our moon's size.   To achieve this I have assumed:   the first moon having 1.1 lunar radius, the second 2.3 and the third 1.1.   Their orbits are 18, 36, 72 days.  I don't really care about their density and I assumed that their masses are   1 lunar mass (probably rocky) 3 lunar mass (water or ice world) 0.3 lunar mass (probably ice world)    I guess that to be more stable i should have eccentricities smaller than 0.05 and inclination equal to zero.  I am not sure about the spin of my moons, is there a chance being tidal locked? This is my effort to achieve maximum stability of the system, what parameters should I reconsider to make it more stable? I am willing to change almost everything even the resonance, but I want them to be visible from my planet in similar way moon is to Earth. Have in mind this question is about a fictional world for a fantasy story so even the minimum possibilities for that senario to happen is enough for me. So any ideas?  P.S I have asked a similar question on worldbuild.stackexchange but they directed me also here for a better answer.   "

On the other hand - ""false color"" pictures of infrared etc. are fine. "
1707,"How was Earth's ""quasi-satellite"" 2016 HO3 ""first spotted"" and it's orbit determined?","Under a question I asked a few days ago Have there been any documented mini-moons since 2006 RH120? @Hobbes mentioned the recent news about 2016 HO3 - a near-Earth asteroid that stays near Earth because its orbit around the sun is coupled to Earth. Thus the term quasi-satellite.  [website]In this NASA JPL video (above) the view is rotating around the sun following Earth. You can see the earth move slightly closer and farther from the sun since the Earth's orbit is not quite circular.  [website]This video (above) from [website]The NASA JPL news brief states:     The asteroid's orbit also undergoes a slow, back-and-forth twist over multiple decades. ""The asteroid's loops around Earth drift a little ahead or behind from year to year, but when they drift too far forward or backward, Earth's gravity is just strong enough to reverse the drift and hold onto the asteroid so that it never wanders farther away than about 100 times the distance of the moon,"" said Chodas. ""The same effect also prevents the asteroid from approaching much closer than about 38 times the distance of the moon. In effect, this small asteroid is caught in a little dance with Earth.""      note: Paul Chodas is the manager of NASA's Center for Near-Earth Object (NEO) Studies   The item goes on to say:     Asteroid 2016 HO3 was first spotted on April 27, 2016, by the Pan-STARRS 1 asteroid survey telescope on Haleakala, Hawaii, operated by the University of Hawaii's Institute for Astronomy and funded by NASA's Planetary Defense Coordination Office. The size of this object has not yet been firmly established, but it is likely larger than 120 feet (40 meters) and smaller than 300 feet (100 meters).   First, I think it's quite cool that there even exists a Planetary Defense Office. It must be fun to go to work every day knowing that you are defending the planet!  I am interested in the story behind ""...first spotted..."".  The Pan STARRS telescope PS1 ([website]I looked at the entry for 2016 HO3 (SPK-ID: 3752445) in the NASA JPL Small Body Data Browser and saw this:    The solution (shown on June 18) was calculated on June 11 2016 by an ""O. Matic"" :) using data going back to 2004.   As I said above, I am interested in the story behind ""...first spotted..."".  What were the sequence of events? Does ""spotted"" mean identified/flagged as an unknown object? Did it trigger a search of a database of earlier survey images from other telescopes? Is there a list available of the 80 total observations used? I'm curious if a twelve year old ""first known image of 2016 HO3"" exists. "
1708,How did our ancestors discover the Solar System?,"I wonder, how did our ancestors discover the Solar System? They did not have any telescopes to see distant objects, right?

1711,Aperture photometry uncertainties,"Suppose I have a 2D data array with number of counts in each pixel (i.e., this is the image array). Suppose I have another 1-1 mapped same-shape data array that gives the 1-sigma Gaussian standard deviation in the number of counts in each pixel in the image (i.e., this is the error array).   If I do circular aperture photometry, I just calculate -2.5*log10(summed counts within aperture) + magnitudeZeropoint.   On the other hand, for the magnitude uncertainty on my aperture magnitude, I read that I'm supposed to do a quadrature sum of the errors within my aperture, then compute the fractional flux uncertainty as the ratio of my quadrature-summed uncertainty divided by my measured counts from the image, and then magnitude error = 2.5*log10(1 + fractional flux uncertainty).   How come the uncertainties have to be quadrature summed ([tex]), instead of just added up like I do with the image pixel values? The quadrature sum results in a smaller errorbar but is that realistic? Also, I emphasize that my data arrays are in units of counts (i.e., ADU's), not electrons. "

1717,"Why does the Sun have different day lengths, but not the gas giants?","The Sun's rotation period varies from about 25 days at the equator to about 38 days at the poles. As I understand it, this is because the Sun is not solid, and because of the way centripetal force works, the equator must move faster than the poles.  Question: if this works, why do Jupiter/Saturn/Uranus/Neptune have well-defined days? Why don't the equators of these planets rotate faster than the poles as well? For example, Wikipedia's article on Jupiter gives the length of a Jovian day as 9h 55m 30s, which is so precise that it implies Jupiter does not have a rotational period which varies with latitude. "

So some asteroids not only oscillate between L4 and L5, between being trojans or greeks, but even go via L3, on the opposite side of the Sun? Are their orbits circular as Neptune's (in this case) or highly eccentrical? How could an object in the same orbit as Neptune have another orbital period than Neptune? Or how else can it migrate between L3, L4 and L5?  And are ""trojan"" objects expected to gather in L3 too?  EDIT:  I'd like to add these illustrations because I think they illustrate well how a regularly orbiting object seems to ""stay"" longer at L3, L4, L5. (I'm not sure whether ""jumping trojans"" have some significant other characteristics, though).     "
1719,Why do some neutron stars become pulsars?,"I suspect this may be an open problem in astronomy, but I have to ask anyway.  There doesn't seem to be any large-scale difference in the formation of pulsars from the formation of ""normal"" neutron stars. Yet pulsars end up emitting electromagnetic radiation, while others - ""radio quiet"" neutron stars - do not.  Why do are some neutron stars formed as pulsars, while others are not?  This is partly based on What causes a star to become a pulsar?, but the answer does not cover this part. "
1720,Are lunar occultations visible to the naked eye?,"The Moon occults a lot of stars. But are these events visible to the naked eye?

(I suppose occultation during an eclipse is both invisible and unlikely, right?)  Venus, the brightest planet, like the new Moon always stays near the horizon. But could one actually see even Venus disappear behind the lunar anti-crust? A popular medieval islamic symbol suggests to me that they were well aware of this phenomena. Both the Moon and Venus are still symbolically important in their culture. But was occultation directly visible or inferred?     "

1723,What is the organic material in Saturn's rings?,"The phys.org articleSurprising chemical complexity of Saturn's rings changing planet's upper atmosphere about the chemical complexity of Saturn's rings, quotes a member of the INMS (Thomas Cravens) as saying,     What the paper is describing is the environment in the gap between the inner ring and upper atmosphere, and some of the things found were expected, such as water,"" Cravens said. ""What was a surprise was the mass spectrometer saw methane—no one expected that. Also, it saw some carbon dioxide, which was unexpected. The rings were thought to be entirely water. But the innermost rings are fairly contaminated, as it turns out, with organic material caught up in ice. (italics and boldface are mine).   What is the nature of this organic material?  Does he simply mean a few carbon-based molecules like methane, propane, and butane, or maybe only methane,  or is it a much more interesting cocktail of chemicals than that?  It also links to Chemical interactions between Saturn’s atmosphere and its rings published in Science, but the article is paywalled. "

1726,Black holes and material interaction,"I was wondering about what happens when a black hole forms.  I mean, a black hole forms when a star collapses, so when an enormous mass of protons, electrons, neutrons etc collapses together. But when it does, all those particles should come ""in contact"", so what happens when electrons and protons come in contact? Shouldn't they annihilate each other releasing energy? In the end, shouldn't the singularity be composed only by the mass of particles without an electrical charge?  I'm not a professional, I just find astronomy fascinating and I like to read about it, so forgive me if I said something obviously wrong :) "
1727,Can't pulsars and stars be used for gravitational wave measurement?,"Suppose that we collected photons from a distant star, and they arrive regularly at 15 photons every microsecond onto a CCD, when a gravity wave bends space time, wouldn't the regular 15 photons graph wobble as a result of the gravitational wave?  Why does the LISA observatory have to compare laser timings, if pulsars can be as precise as atomic clocks, can't it just compare a bunch of pulsar signals? A single satellite that records 50 pulsars would move compared the the pulsars and would have a frequency of 50Hz ticks with pulses which can be graphed at kHz frequencies. "
1728,"Could an ejected ""extra ice-giant"" still be lurking in distant solar orbit?","BACKGROUND  Hot Jupiters are thought to have migrated inwards, implying that another giant planet has been ejected in order to conserve the orbital momentum of those planetary systems. The number of interstellar ""vagabond planets"" has been estimated to be as many as the number of stars. And simulations show that if the Solar System started out with an extra gas giant next to Jupiter which was ejected, then one can end up with a very good fit with today's Solar System.   QUESTIONS  Where would such a hypothetical ejected ice giant be today? Should it be closer or further away than hot Jupiter-ejected planets because it is much smaller? Could it stay in an Oort cloud type orbit during several billion years (maybe ~15 orbits around the Milky Way) without being pulled off by passing stars? At what distance could we today observe a Uranus sized planet? Should it stay in the ecliptical plane or could its orbit have become greatly inclined when it was ejected? "
1729,How could a supernova seed solar nebula?,"If the heavier elements such as Uranium came from a supernova, then this supernova had to sit somewhere right in the middle of the original solar nebula, because although the ejected matter traveled extremely fast by star or planet standard, it was still not fast enough to truly get across the empty space between clusters of stars. Does this mean the supernova was actually birthed and died in the same nebula or at least in the immediate vicinity in a region that is rich in hydrogen? Could the solar system be still in this nebula? What could endow the solar system as a whole with so much momentum that it acquired a different trajectory around the galaxy than its mother nebula, if the solar nebula is in effect no where to be found? "
1730,Is there a relation with the noun planet and to be in a plane?,"This morning I was in the shower and it struck me that the word planet might be related to the fact that the PLANEts orbit the sun in a PLANE. Did this naming somewhat happen by accident or was it consciously chosen? If it is the former then I'm simply mindblown by the fact that I didn't see this relation before.  I quickly looked up the etymology on the word planet, which comes from Greek and means wanderer/wandering. Nonetheless, could there still be a relation, both words might stem from the same origin...? Thanks in advance! "
1731,How will the Breakthrough Initiatives affect other astronomy observations?,"BACKGROUND  The Breakthrough Initiatives is in the news because of a $100 million private donation for a SETI project. It doesn't seem to be for building any new observatory (but maybe for buying computing power for handling the data for SETI purposes?). It will use two of the greatest radio telescopes in the world, Parks and Green Banks, and optical Automated Planet Finder Telescope at Lick, some part of the time during 10 years.  QUESTIONS   Does this mean a zero sum redistribution of observatory time from other astronomical purposes to SETI? How does it work when someone can buy the usage of these telescopes? Isn't there a danger in letting popular scifi ideas decide how the great telescopes should be used? Do recruited big names like Hawkins and Drake decide how they should be used anyway??  "
1732,How do I imagine time difference?,"I could never understand how in Interstellar, they say our every hour spent on the planet is equal to 7 years on Earth and when he returns back to her daughter, the father is older than her daughter. How is this possible when both the planet over there and Earth and for the fact everything in the universe is moving with the same time reference point. The age of daughter and father should have been the same.  I don't know but is this termed as Time Dilation ?  How does this work ?  Please avoid any formulae in explanation. "
1733,How can a planet have a 90° inclination?,"Planetary systems as we understand it exist from a disk of mass when the parent star is young.  That's why all our planets are in the same plane, or close to it.  See also Why is the solar system often shown as a 2D plane?,  Inclination of planets, and answers there.  Yet the newly announced Kepler-452b apparently has an inclination of close to 90° (89.806+0.134−0.049°).  Do we have any model of solar system formation that explains how this can form? "
1734,Would an X-ray-based pulsar timing array in orbit or on the Moon to study GW background be effective?,"This is a follow-on question to Can't pulsars and stars be used for gravitational wave measurement? and the helpful answers there.  The Wikipedia article subsection Pulsar timing array; Active and proposed PTAs mentions:     This is an extremely delicate experiment, although millisecond pulsars are stable enough clocks that the time of arrival of the pulses can be predicted to the required accuracy; the experiments use collections of 20 to 50 pulsars to account for dispersion effects in the atmosphere and in the space between us and the pulsar.    as a way to measure the Gravitational wave background.  Pulsar timing can also be done at X-ray wavelengths and the modest X-ray telescope of the Neutron Star Interior Composition Explorer (NICER) currently mounted on the International Space Station has been used to determine it's orbit to high precision based on a sequence of pulsar timing measurements and a model of the Earth's gravity field as a proof-of-concept demonstration. See Is NICER/SEXTANT the first civilian “spacecraft” to determine it's own position in space without GPS or uplinked data?  Question: Would an X-ray-based pulsar timing array in orbit or on the Moon to study GW background be effective? This coul take some loading off of the large Dishes and possibly offer a lot more time coverage. The X-ray telescopes are fairly small and amenable to deployment in a medium or high Earth orbit. Equipped with radio transponders or corner cube reflectors like LAGEOS their positions would be regularly measurable and highly predictable between measurements. The movement of The Moon's position and orientation is known to essentially centimeter accuracy due to extensive laser ranging of the Apollo-era retroreflectors.   To what quantum mechanical 'discoveries' have retroreflectors on the Moon contributed? How is a result of no time variation in the gravitational constant 𝐺 related to a measurement of no local expansion?   But I don't know if the timing of the pulses in the X-rays would be  better or worse for this kind of measurement. As pointed out in International Pulsar Timing Array ""The resources of the IPTA are substantial"" and dispersion in the ionosphere and atmosphere are a problem for the radio observations and the X-ray measurements above the atmosphere would solve that problem, but there may be others.

1737,What's fixed in Ariel that is moving in other planet-hunting space telescopes?,"The BBC News article UK will lead European exoplanet mission says:     Steady platform      And one aspect that would work in Ariel's favour is the absence of any moving parts in its build, commented Plato team-member Dr Don Pollaco from Warwick University, UK.      ""The issue with all of these planet experiments is that the signals you are looking for are so incredibly small that any systematics in the instrument itself will dominate the signal,"" he explained.      ""And the systematics are often associated with bits that move. So the great thing about Ariel is that it is fixed-format - nothing changes,"" he told BBC News.   Question: What's fixed in Ariel that is moving in other planet-hunting space telescopes? Is it only aspects of the satellite's telescope and payload module, or does this difference include aspects of the satellite's attitude control system and other things in the service module as well? See ESA's Ariel. "
1738,How did New Horizons take such well-lit pictures of Pluto?,The photos of Pluto from New Horizons are truly beautiful.  But considering that Pluto is so far away from its nearest start - our Sun - how is it so well lit up?   Did the New Horizons have a massive flash mounted on its camera to illuminate the planet or is there just a lot of ambient light in space?   I'm really curious.

1741,Are white dwarf stars supported by proton degeneracy as well?,"In general, fermions form a degenerate gas under high density or extremely low temperature. It's clear that white dwarf stars are supported by electron degeneracy pressure. However, there are still a significant number of protons in a white dwarf. Under those high densities, do the protons form a degenerate gas?  In addition, are white dwarfs supported by proton degeneracy pressure as much as they are by electron degeneracy pressure? "
1742,Calculating the mass of star,"I am doing a project which requires that I have data for the mass of several stars. However, the data for mass of stars is obviously not readily available as it's really hard to calculate. In such a scenario, would it be alright to use the mass-luminosity relationship with different values of p(3.5 for a main sequence star) without getting major errors?  Also, what value of p should i use for other stars like white and brown dwarfs? "
1743,Could the earth become a star if more mass was added?,"I've heard that the only difference between a star and a planet is mass, meaning that if planets accredited enough mass they would too become stars.   Does this mean that the star started off as a planet? Stars require hydrogen fusion and earth has little H. Could the earth become a star if more mass was added, but its relatively low abundance of hydrogen remained the same?  "
1744,Pluto- Current theories regarding its geological nature?,"The images of New Horizons from Pluto will take more a year to arrive from space, for the moment with have some compressed images as a preview.   Nasa has advanced some information regarding the geologically inactive zone, but there has been no information regarding the possible geologically active zones, on the formation of the plateaus and the mountains.  What forces could be driving geothermal activity of what nature on Pluto? What can be learnt from theories of the moons of Jupiter and Saturn to understand activity inside of Pluto? What is the theoretical temperature of the center of the dwarf planet?     "
1745,What is the reason the Chinese want to measure the <30Mhz radiation behind the moon?,"On the Earth it is difficult to detect radiation below 30MHz from space due to our atmosphere. But why do they want to measure this radiation behind the moon? It has something to do with the big bang, but isn't the frequency of CMB not around 160GHz?  The Chinese are planning to launch a satellite with a 30 MHz antenna on it in 2018.  Aren't there already enough decent measurements of the CMB? So what would they like to find concerning the Big Bang? "
1746,How much helium has been created since the Big Bang?,"When I try to find figures for the amount of helium today and just after the Big Bang, I get similar figures.  I was expecting that all of the stars since then would have created more helium.  Is the amount below our ability to estimate?  Is helium being consumed at a similar or greater rate to produce heavier elements?    Alternatively, can we measure/ estimate a drop in the hydrogen?  I presume that little hydrogen is being created.  I am unaware of any common nuclear process which creates lone protons.  (Please correct me if appropriate.)  Clarification: The Wikipedia Big Bang article mentions helium being created after a few minutes in the Big Bang nucleosynthesis.  So, it is helium created after this point that I am asking about.  I am presuming that negligible helium was created between this point and the first stars much later.  (Again, please correct me if I am wrong.) "
1747,Does the retrograde movement affect the true angular distance between 2 planets?,I need to calculate the relative angular path between two planets in the geocentric view or in other words the number of degrees of a circle one planet travels away from another planet around the Earth. In the heliocentric system I simply subtract the longitude of one planet from the longitude of the other and add n*360 if they made full cycles in between. Would the same work for the geocentric coordinates? Does the loop a retrograding planet makes in the sky actually count as its path? Should I consider the retrograde movement as an optical illusion or include it in the formula and how? 
1748,"Hubble law, cosmological redshift and distance","I have got confused with some cosmology formulas which calculate distance.  The most famous formula is indeed the Hubble law which says (nowadays) velocity is proportional to Hubble's parameter at current time.  On the other hand we can find the velocity from redshift.  By Hubble law it is possible to evaluate distance but it's not clear for me that what does this distance mean...! As the photons, which are now observed, are belong to another redshift (larger) and by traveling toward Earth the have become ""redder"" because of expansion of universe, what does the observed redshift stand for? The actual redshift of the galaxy at observation time (although we can't recieve the photons now), the redshift at emission time (that means we do not calculate current distance of the galaxy) or something else?  Thanks a lot. "
1749,How to find the distance between two quasars,"I want to calculate the distance between two quasars of which I know the angular position and the red shift. Let [tex] and [tex] and suppose [tex].  I know how to find the angular separation [tex] between them by means of the angular coordinates. But how to find the comoving distance (at epoch [tex]) from them ? I know how to find the comoving distance from the Earth of the two quasars, can we find the distance between them using these two distances?  A related question is to find the redshift of [tex] as seen by [tex] at the epoch when [tex] received the light emitted from [tex] .  There is some standard method to solve this problem ? "
1750,How close would merging black holes have to be to feel gravitational waves?,"Recently LIGO discovered gravitational waves caused by two black holes that were orbiting each other, and then collapsed into one black hole. A few months later, we find out that this actually happens quite often. However, these collisions are far enough away from Earth that no one can feel the gravitational waves, and it actually takes very precise measurement to even determine that they happen. So my question is, how close would a black hole collision have to be for us to feel the gravitational waves pass through Earth?  Secondly, is this even possible? As in, would the distance have to be so short that we'd get swallowed up before the black holes collided? And, if we were to feel such gravitational waves, what would they feel like?  EDIT: Let's say that the black holes have the same mass as Earth, giving their event horizons a radius of about 9 mm (the size of a dime). So two Earth-sized black holes that are stuck in an orbit finally collapse is the scenario here. "
1751,Which lens and magnification is best to see planets?,"I just bought a Celestron Travel Scope 70 and it comes with a 20mm and a 10mm eyepiece. I get a good view of the Moon but I am not able to see Jupiter, Saturn or Mars as expected. I read about the Barlow lens but I am not sure how much magnification is required to view these planets. So based on my telescope, which lens should I go for? And should I also get Red/Blue filters to view them? "
1752,"How can a rotation period of a planet's satellite/moon be ""chaotic"" (like Hyperion around Saturn)?","According to wikipedia (see info below image) Hyperion's rotation period around Saturn is ""chaotic"".

1756,Why is the CMB not simply travelling parallel to us?,"When we look to the distant farthest reaches of the universe we see light that was emitted at the big bang 14 billion years ago.  But the universe was tiny back then so that light, which is only reaching us now, was emitted pretty much right next to us (in galactic terms).  So it's been traveling for 14 billion years at the speed of light and is only reaching us right now, despite only having set off from right next door.  The standard explanation of how it's covered such a tiny distance begins with ""expansion"", which means the light has been swimming against the tide effectively and since that doesn't fit properly, it's augmented by inventing inflation which is basically a huge rush of Hubbly expansion at the outset, to increase the distance away from us before it began swimming towards us in accordance with Hubble's law which we now observe.  If we instead explain how it's covered such a tiny distance by saying that we are all departing the big bang at or near the speed of light because we are actually for example something like Hawking Radiation, then we don't need ""Expansion"" do we?  Because the CMB is just the light that was emitted near parallel to us and has been traveling through space next to us all this time.  So it's quite natural that it is only now reaching us.  And then we don't need to invent inflation, do we, to make Hubble's law and the Big Bang fit?  And since it's been traveling so close to parallel all this time it seems natural that it should have such a low level of energy - unlike light emitted right next to us recently.  And then we have a natural reason for mass-energy equivalence don't we, because everything's moving at the speed of light anyway.  And then we have a natural reason for quantum theory don't we because if everything around us is moving nearly parallel at the speed of light then only its direction can change, not its speed so we would expect to find that if we impose a speed vector on objects which only have direction, their degrees of freedom will be over-specified and we won't be able to define their parameters all at once because they don't really exist.  And then it becomes obvious that ""perceived speed"" is simply an aggregation of how parallel the component parts of something are, so simple objects containing minimal component parts must travel at the speed light while compound things can move more slowly because they have component parts moving in different, changing directions around each other and their overall motion is the combination of the parts.  And then that would predict that a photon can't age.  And then everything seems to make a lot more sense because when we look out at the ""Big Bang"" in distant space and see it receding at the speed of light, well that's what we know it to be doing anyway so whoopdedoo who cares.  And because the universe is now just a set of paths in 4-dimensional space with no ""speed"", it should be described by a rotation group SO(3,1) and oh hang on haven't I seen that somewhere before, like the set of transformations in relativity?  But then we would all have to be made of light.  So how do we design an experiment in which we bounce beams of appropriately formed light off each other itself at exceptionally low angles of incidence in order to prove that they do, to the surprise of almost the entire physics community, bounce off each other?  And how did we get in such a pickle inventing all this inflation and dark matter? "
1757,"""Mysterious radio signals"" - how could a geostationary satellite and Ross-128 line up with Arecibo?","The Phys.org article 'Mystery' signal from space is solved. It's not aliens cites a summary of the conclusion ""by Abel Mendez, director of the Planetary Habitability Laboratory at the University of Puerto Rico at Arecibo in a blog post Friday, revealing the true nature of the signals.""     After further fueling speculation by summoning the world experts in the hunt for life elsewhere in the universe—The SETI Berkeley Research Center at the University of California—the team issued its conclusion.      ""We are now confident about the source of the Weird! Signal,"" Mendez wrote.      ""The best explanation is that the signals are transmissions from one or more geostationary satellites.""      The signals only appeared around Ross 128 because it is located ""close to the celestial equator where many geostationary satellites are placed,"" Mendez added.   The article also goes on to say:     Astronomers detected strange signals that seemed to be coming from a dwarf star about 11 light-years away, but have now determiend that the signals are interference from a distant geostationary satellite   Mendez is further quoted the Space.com article Weird Radio Signals Detected from Nearby Red Dwarf Star:     Each of these hypotheses has its issues, he said. For example, solar flares of the type that could be responsible generally occur at lower frequencies. In addition, Mendez wrote, there aren't a lot of other objects in the Ross 128 field of view, ""and we have never seen satellites emit bursts like that.""   and in the Space.com article Not Aliens: Weird Radio Signal from Star Likely Has Duller Explanation:     ""This explains why the signals were within the satellite’s frequencies and only appeared and persisted in Ross 128; the star is close to the celestial equator, where many geostationary satellites are placed,"" Mendez added. ""This fact, though, does not yet explain the strong dispersion-like features of the signals (diagonal lines in the figure); however, it is possible that multiple reflections caused these distortions, but we will need more time to explore this and other possibilities.""   Wikipedia lists the star Ross 128 at at declination of about +0° 48', and the latitude of the Arecibo telescope to be about +18° 21'. Satellites in geostationary orbits are in a circular ring approximately coincident with the equator at a distance from the center of the Earth of only about 42,000 km. From the Northern hemisphere, geostationary satellites will appear several degrees south in declination. (See this interesting answer.)  For Arecibo, I calculate about -3.2° declination.  QUESTION: How could a radio telescope have picked up satellite signals from a satellite at about -3.2° declination while observing a star at +0.8° declination? And why wasn't this immediately ruled out - surely radio telescopists know about satellites by now, especially the crowded ring of geostationary satellites! Aren't there standard procedures to rule these out before making announcements?  Could the half-angle acceptance really have been 4 degrees? Since the brown red dwarf is extremely close to the solar system, could proper motion put it 4 degrees away from the value listed in Wikipedia?      above: ""The signal that seemed to emanate from the red dwarf star Ross 128, as detected by the Arecibo Observatory in May 2017 (enclosed in the red frame).""

(currently unanswered, should I move it here?)   These result in maximum arrival times of about 42 milliseconds and 1 second, respectively.  In order to combine these signals, mathematical correlation is used, and the ""beam is steered"" by varying the time delay in the correlation. This can be done in real time, or during ""playback"". In the case of the Event Horizon Telescope (from which we are waiting for a press conference next Wednesday) suitcases full of hard drives are flown on airplanes from the various sites and collected before the correlation can even begin.   How does the Event Horizon Telescope implement the interferometry?   Question: Have there been observations with much longer delays used in correlation of radio signals? Minutes? Months? "

However, galaxies are more or less a collection of material and objects — why is it, then, that most stars form a plane due to the angular momentum, but some patches of stars do not?  In fact, globular clusters often contain some of the earliest stars formed in a galaxy, right? How come they do not flatten, yet a lot of the older stars do? "

As far as my very basic knowledge in astronomy goes, I think you can even see stars during a ""Sun-Moon-Eclipse"" here on earth. So besides having here a spectacular ""Sun-Pluto-Eclipse"", I further more ask myself if that eclipse is even necessary to see other stars, as those pictures are already taken quit far away from sun, and outside an atmosphere.  Is that not enough to see stars? Or does NASA remove the stars from the images, before publishing them? (If so, why? Not to distract?)  Thanks for answers!  "

1769,What is the probability of an astronomical body hitting you?,"It appears that there is already a calculated ballpark for meteor fatalities, but what about other factors such as space trash, comets, and other miscellaneous items in space?  Is it possible to obtain a ballpark estimate? "
1770,"Pictures of galaxies, nebulae: which way is up?","We are used to viewing pictures of the Earth and the planets with their North Pole pointing towards the upper portion of the photo. But when a space telescope snaps photos of cosmic entities, do they rotate the photo around to get an attractive composition? Is it a subjective rotation, or are there rules? Which way is up? "
1771,The Three Elements in the Milankovitch Cycles,"According to the Serbian geophysicist Milutin Milankovitch, there are three elements that make an ice age possible:   Eccentricity (orbital shape):  Varying between 0.000055 and 0.0679 over the course of 100,000 years (1.0 being a perfect circle). Obliquity (axial tilt):  Varying between 22.1 and 24.5 degrees over the course of 41,000 years. Axial precession (change in the orientation of the rotational axis on a rotating body):  Polaris being the North Star for a total of 26,000 degrees.   The question is how connected those three elements are, in the event someone wants to change the numbers in a worldbuilding process to make either a longer or shorter ice age:  Does the duration and extent of eccentricity affect those of obliquity and precession?  Or does the duration and extent of obliquity affect those of eccentricity and precession?  Or does the duration and extent of precession affect those of eccentricity and obliquity? "
1772,What is the large astronomical instrument shown in this 1918 eclipse expedition photo?,"This nice video musing about (among other things) the US Naval Observatory's $3,500 expedition to Baker City or at least Baker County Oregon to observe the June 18, 1918 solar eclipse, there is a photograph of the expedition showing both normal-sized portable telescopes, and in the background a very long telescope (at least 6 meters, can't see the end) held up by a ladder, with an even longer tent extending backward from the shack sitting at the bottom of the telescope along the ground.  What is this instrument? How does it function optically, and what kind of data does it produce?    below: Screenshot from the video, photo credits available at the end.   "
1773,"If objects don't move when the universe expands, how can the expansion result in redshift?","I am approaching this topic from a layman's perspective and view this as a logic puzzle, but when someone tries to get me to accept the logic, I'm never convinced by their arguments.   According to the wiki page on the expanding universe, the universe is expanding (which is how we see redshifted light from distant galaxies), however this expansion does not result in the movement of objects across space away from each other. Instead, this expansion is the formation of new space such that all of the objects in space maintain a static relationship with space.   This should mean, that as light produced by a distant light source that is expanding away from us, it is not moving away from the photon. The photon then travels across space, and this trip takes longer as a result of the expansion, but once the photon is in space near to Earth, the earth is not moving away from the light. By the time the light is at the same distance from the telescope as a flashlight held in front of the telescope, the telescope is not moving away from the photon any more than it is moving away from the photon produced by the flashlight.   So, IF the expansion is not the result of motion across space, HOW do we show redshift??????   Another comment, laymans perspective The whole reason it can make sense that objects far enough away can expand away from us FASTER than the speed of light (which is the reason why telescopes can't see further) is that these objects are not moving across space to achieve this expansion.   Another comment in reference to the Raisin Cake.  understanding the expanding universe as a raisin cake swelling, therefore the actual cake that is in contact with any raisin stays in contact with that raisin,, the raisins do not move through the cake,,, APART. BUT, in space, the raisins actually ARE moving through the cake. Also, the PHOTON that travels across space from the distant light source to the telescope, travels across space. additionally, it's NOT useful to think of this transaction of energy in a raisin cake, because the raisins DO travel across space away from each-other as the cake swells, but this is NOT how we can possibly understand objects in space expanding away from us on Earth faster than the speed of light.  "
1774,"What is the shape (along the plane, not up-down) of stellar orbits in flat spiral galaxies","What I mean is, with a central mass orbits are relatively simple, but orbits around the galaxy are different, in essence as the star orbits through the dark matter halo, the further it moves away from the center of the galaxy the greater the gravitational field, so while orbits tend to slow down as kinetic energy is turned into potential energy, stars are effectively orbiting around more mass the further they are from the center of the galaxy, which might speed them up. The equal areas over equal time rule would seem to no longer apply.  So, ignoring up and down motion relative to the plane of the galaxy, is there a common shape for galactic orbits? Is there a formula? I think eccentricity would still apply, but I don't think the orbits would be ellipses, so it would be a different kind of eccentricity. Would these orbits tend to circularize (in an ideal dark matter cloud, ignoring perturbations. Obviously perturbations would lead to, in a practical sense, unpredictable orbits, not neat and tidy formulas. I gather from a show I caught on the science channel that the Milky Way's magnetic field also plays a role in forming its spiral arms, but I'm asking in an ideal, mathematical sense, what shape would orbits be through a galaxy, from a 2D point of view, ignoring up and down motion.  Update  It occurred to me that the question might be more simply asked by a black hole in effect ""orbiting"" through a planet or even a low-velocity neutrino (if there are any low-velocity neutrinos). The inside a planet orbit is quite different than the Kepler orbit, because gravity increases as the object moves further away from the center. The overall orbit might still be somewhat like an ellipse but the laws for such an orbit would be different, you would see the highest acceleration at the furthest points from the center though you'd probably still see the highest velocity at the closest point to the center.  Anyway, I'm mostly just curious if those shape has been worked out and what it looks like. "
1775,What is the average color of the universe?,"Our Earth, being a beautiful blue orb, has an overall perceived wavelength of somewhere near 470 nm, that being the wavelength of light blue, because the oceans play an enormous role in the weighted average of all of the Earth's colors.  But what about the whole universe? The Earth is nothing in comparison to the host of multicolored stars, ranging from deep red to fiery blue. Taking into consideration the number of stars and each separate color's weighted average,  could we calculate the average color of the universe? "
1776,Would we be able to feel the acceleration of a planet with a highly eccentric orbit?,"Even though our Earth moves on average 67,000 miles per hour around the Sun, we cannot feel its movement since its speed is fairly constant. More precisely, its change in speed is very low and our bodies cannot detect that low of acceleration.  What if instead a hypothetical human observer were placed on a planet with a very eccentric orbit, say 0.99? Would that human be able to feel the planet's acceleration as it approached its host star, and as it receded from its host star? And if a human observer would not be able to feel any acceleration even at e=0.99, what is the minimum eccentricity, if any, that a planet must have in order for a hypothetical human observer to feel the effects of its acceleration and deceleration? "
1777,"Star formation: When a nebula collapses, is it only the gasses that form the star?","A nebula is made of dust (elements heavier than He and H) and gas (H and He).  Stars are made when nebulae's collapse and hydrogen begins to fuse. 99% of nebula material goes into making the star. The left-over 0.01 of debris creates planets.  Does 99% of nebula material that makes the star only consist of gas (He/H) and the 0.01% is the dust which makes the planets?  Question Clarification:  Are the constituents of the 99% of mass that makes the star and the 0.01% mass that makes the planets the same?  I.e.      Does both the 99% and 0.01% compose of mainly He/H and a small portion of metals (meaning the star contains heavier elements like Si and Fe etc before fusion?) OR   is 99% of the nebula composed of He/H, which collapses to form the star, and 0.01% consists of heavier elements that make the planets?  "
1778,Is Universe Sandbox 2 realistic?,"Universe Sandbox 2 is the second installment of Universe Sandbox that is available on Steam. It is an educational simulation game based on astronomy and anything space, it ranges from supernova animations to climate and atmospheric simulations (and of course collisions) but do any of these features hold water? Do they truly resemble the dynamics of space? "
1779,What is the cut-off point of $\frac{\mathrm{d}F}{\mathrm{d}r}$ beyond which no tidal locking will occur?,"I am a beginner, please pardon my non-use of proper astronomical terms. I would appreciate proper edits to my questions.  I have learned that when the [tex] is a very big negative number, that would mean that the far side will have much less gravitational tug than the near side of a satellite. The differential gravity or [tex] will be as follows  [tex]  If we compute [tex] of Earth-Moon system we get [tex]  I was surprised to know that Ganymede, being almost 3 times as far away from Jupiter as our Moon is from Earth, still is tidally locked.  If we compute [tex] of Jupiter-Ganymede system we get [tex]  I then wondered what is the [tex] of Sun-Earth that our Earth is not tidally locked to it and I found [tex]   Which is a very small negative number so the difference in tug is not significant.  So what is the minimum [tex] (or I guess ""maximum"") value or a boundary value at which the object can be tidally locked and beyond that, the tidal locking won't occur? "
1780,Is it possible to create a traditional clock solar system?,"Is it possible to create the following system of satellites?:   Place a satellite that orbits the some object X, once per day. Call it D. Place a satellite that orbits D, once per hour. Call it H Place a satellite that orbits H, once per minute. Call it M. Place a satellite that orbits M, once per second. Call it S.   If possible, what are some values for the weights, rotational speed, and radii that would work?  Also, does the universe have a limit on how many layers of satellite systems it permits? "
1781,Is time taken into account by astronomers when creating and using maps of the universe?,"There's really two questions I'm asking.  Firstly, when maps are produced of stars and galaxies, are they just produced as we see them now from our viewpoint? Or are they based on the motion of those bodies? Eg Galaxy X is 1 million light years away and we know it's moving at Y speed, so it's real position now is actually 1 million years worth of movement along that trajectory.  Secondly, are those things taken into account when doing other studies of things like dark matter? Ie things are actually further apart than what we see because we're seeing them as they were Z million years ago. I would expect that would affect calculations for things like how much 'missing' matter there was.  To try to further clarify this second question, simplifying things to 3 points on a triangle... if we're at A and we observe points B and C which are X billion light years apart, then the effect of gravity on the speed of B and C moving apart would have been greater in the past when they were closer together and furthermore the effects of the current gravitational force will take more than X billion years to reach the other object. As far as I understand, dark matter is a way to account for observed gravitational effects that can't be accounted for in other ways. When astronomers do these calculations, can I assume that they have taken into account the time delay in the effects of gravity between galaxies? Or have I in my naivety, stumbled on some profound insight! (I doubt it.) "
1782,How common are exoplanets in distant orbits?,"Are there many single transits in the Kepler data, which might be exoplanets with a longer orbital period than the time they have been observed for transits? Can any conclusions be drawn about how common they are? Is there reason to believe that the outer solar system is a common configuration? I suppose that slow moving planets are hard to detect also with doppler measurements. Will the upcoming telescopes aimed at nearby stars be able to find 10+ AU orbital radius planets? "
1783,How would light from a blue or red star affect the way we see?,How would things look if we saw them through the light of a blue or red star? Would there be any changes? 
1784,Do planetary surface temperatures change in unison in a solar system?,"Are there any known correlations between the changes in planetary surface temperatures in a solar system?  If so, do the farthest planets have smaller albeit correlated changes? "
1785,What is the highest granularity focal-plane array on a dish radio telescope? Or is this the ONLY ONE?,"There is a short Wikipedia article Focal Plane Arrays that enumerates some projects, but my question is more along the lines of what is (at least) nearly complete or in ""first light"" phase, even if not commissioned yet.  I'd like to differentiate between focal plane arrays (an array of multiple feeds and amplifiers) used in single dish telescopes, and those integrated into multiple dish arrays, because I'm particularly curious about single dishes being used for spatial information, or even true imaging. Ideally, the answer will give some information for each case.  In the case of single dish instruments, are the elements - roughly speaking - used as pixels? Despite the longer wavelength, it's still optics and it is a telescope. If there are N individual, uncoupled feeds, does one build up an image roughly N times faster? Is the relative phase between the feeds ever used (for single dish instruments)?    For those like me who aren't already familiar with focal plane arrays, here is a random picture from one of the links I found in a quick internet search. It's from the Parkes 21cm Multibeam Receiver, has (had?) 13 receivers and sat at the focus of the 64m dish. The photo is dated 1997 - I have a hunch there's been some development in this technique in the intervening 20 years.  Is this actually the only one?      Edit: The Parkes array is still in use as shown below:    Above: Superposition of the half-power beam widths of the 13-element array of the Parkes 21-cm Mutlibeam Receiver, as used in a study of a Fast Radio Bursters.   It's likely the image is a screen shot from from The host galaxy of a fast radio burst Nature volume 530, pages 453–456 (25 February 2016), Keane et al. I can't find my archived copy now, but instead see Phys.org's New fast radio burst discovery finds 'missing matter' in the universe  where the caption there reads:     This image shows the field of view of the Parkes radio telescope on the left. On the right are successive zoom-ins in on the area where the signal came from (cyan circular region). The image at the bottom right shows the Subaru image of the FRB galaxy, with the superimposed elliptical regions showing the location of the fading 6-day afterglow seen with ATCA. Image Credit: D. Kaplan (UWM), E. F. Keane (SKAO).  "
1786,Do other planets with a magnetic field also have two Van Allen belts?,"On Jupiter and Saturn, aurora is seen around the planet's poles, so that implies that there must be a kind of magnetic field around those planets. Perhaps even the moon Europa could have a magnetic field created by salty water (Does it?).  On Earth we have two radiation belts, an inner and outer belt. One contains electrons and the other mostly protons. Do other planets also have these two radiation belts? "
1787,"Relationship between photometric colour and redshift, part two","In the graphs in my previous question here, there are negative-sloped regions as the colour-z relationship oscillates. So if I look at how the I-W2 and W3-U colours change with redshift, as I've done here:    with I-W2 and W3-U both getting lower (bluer, is that right?) does that mean that my graphs indicate one of the upward-sloping regions?  What else does the redshift evolution of I-W2 against W3-U indicate? "
1788,How did single dish (or single receiver) radio telescopes originally generate images?,"That actually sums up my question nicely: How did single dish (or single receiver) radio telescopes originally generate images? - or at least 2D intensity maps or contour plots.  Early radio telescopes were actually not much more than a Directional Antenna pointing up, connected to a sensitive receiver with various filters, maybe an IF stage or two, but no demodulation. You measured the ""noise"" signal strength as a function of time on a chart recorder - pen and ink.   I think there were radio images generated and published well before there were high granularity interferometers and computational correlators. The early ones were contour plots, on 2D plotters - again pen and ink.  How was this done? How did, say, a single dish antenna with a single feed generate radio maps?  edit: It doesn't necessarily have to be a dish antenna - it's the single receiver part I'm interested in. "
1789,Why would atmospheric absorption increase rather than decrease the antenna temperature in Penzias and Wilson's famous CMB observation?,"The classic paper A MEASUREMENT OF EXCESS ANTENNA TEMPERATURE AT 4080 Mc/s begins:     Measurements of the effective zenith noise temperature of the 20-foot horn-reflector antenna (Crawford, Hogg, and Hunt 1961) at the Crawford Hill Laboratory, Holmdel, New Jersey, at 4080 Mc/s have yielded a value about 3.5° K higher than expected. This excess temperature is, within the limits of our observations, isotropic, unpolarized, and free from seasonal variations (July, 1964-April, 1965). A possible explanation for the observed excess noise temperature is the one given by Dicke, Peebles, Roll, and Wilkinson (1965) in a companion letter in this issue.       The total antenna temperature measured at the zenith is 6.7° K of which 2.3° K is due to atmospheric absorption. The calculated contribution due to ohmic losses in the antenna and back-lobe response is 0.9° K.   So, why would it increase? And, what is the significance of zenith in this sentence? "
1790,How far apart can two people watch the moon simultaneously?,"Obviously there's a limited part of earths surface where the moon is visible at any given time. I imagine the area of this surface would be a lot smaller than the area where the sun is visible at any given time, due to the fact that the moon is a lot closer to earth. But how big is that area exactly?  Or, to put it differently: Imagine you are standing outside your house and looking at the moon. At the exact same moment someone else does the same in another location. But how far apart can you (theoretically) be? "
1791,Have any co-orbital exoplanet pairs been discovered (and not subsequently retracted)?,"For this question, I think a good working definition of co-orbital configuration would be two bodies orbiting around a third much larger body in a 1:1 resonance and where neither mass is negligible. In other words, you can't really say that either one is at the other's [tex] because they are interacting with each other more as equals.   I found this article in the New Scientist in my first on-line search, but it has a retraction at the top.  Just for example, here is a theoretical analysis of stability in an ArXiv preprint on the subject: Dynamics of two planets in co-orbital motion.  With the caveats above (which I think are fairly standard for the term ""co-orbital planet"") have any been discovered?   edit: Have any new candidates been at least identified or proposed? "
1792,What solar features would I see at 10x magnification?,"I have a pair of binoculars with 10x magnification, 50mm objective diameter, and 6.5 degree (real) angular field of view.  I'm looking into buying solar filters for it (something like these) so I can view the sun. If I do so, will I be able to see most/many sunspots and planetary transits? Or is this simply not a powerful enough instrument to be worth investing in solar filters for it?  I like the idea of being able to check out the sun sometimes, but I don't know if I'm just getting way out of my league here and would need more complicated and expensive equipment to make it at all worthwhile. Thought I'd ask some experts before buying anything. "
1793,lunar calendar accuracy for predicting new moons,"I wonder, how accurate the lunar calendar is? Can we predict the new moons precisely for tens of years in future? If we know all factors that affects the movement of the moon, then why it is not possible to predict it? "
1794,How fast would Earth need to rotate to fling someone off due to centrifugal force?,"If Earth started spinning fast enough, would the centrifugal force eventually overcome Earth's gravity enough enough to fling someone (let's assume 75 kg) into orbit or into space? If so, how fast would it need to spin?  Being that I'm not a scientist, I'm hoping for a simple answer like, ""one rotation per xx hours/mins/seconds needed to throw someone off Earth"" or something to that effect. Complicated equations and/or jargon is fine for the sciencey types, of course. I just probably won't understand it too much.  "
1795,Could a closely orbiting pulsar be used to study a black hole?,"If we were to locate a pulsar in a close elliptical orbit around a black hole, could this reveal significant information about the black hole (e.g. time dilation / structure)?  Could this even tell us the structure of a black hole (e.g. if it is a singularity, or a sphere formed around the event horizon, or something else)? "
1796,Luminosity of the Milky Way compared to Seyfert galaxies,"This page lists the total luminosity of the Milky Way Galaxy to be [tex] [tex], and [tex] ergs.sec[tex]; this gives a total luminosity for the MW of [tex] ergs.sec[tex].  But Seyfert galaxies can have luminosities of [tex] ergs.sec[tex], and this is due to the high luminosity of the galactic core of a Seyfert.  Since the MW doesn't have an active SMBH, does this mean that the MW is particularly bright due to a high luminosity stellar population? Or am I missing something? "
1797,"What is a radio ""homology telescope"" and is the 500m dish in China one?","This question is about design aspects of large radio telescope dishes which allow them to flex under the influence of gravity as they change elevation angle, and still maintain good optical performance at short wavelengths - on the order of a centimeter or less.  What is a radio ""homology telescope"" and is the 500m dish in China one?  Background:  I was reading about radio astronomy for background on this and this question. In this informative and entertaining NRAO page I saw the term homology telescope for the first time, so I immediately select-right-click-serched it. At first I was confused by these Mathematics Stackexchange and Stanford Bio-X links:   homology of mapping telescope of a monoid action of a monoid on a mapping telescope Genome Space Telescope: Bringing DNA Sequence Homology into the 21st Century   until I realizes that these quit different usages of homology and/or telescope :)  I found the following explanation in Tools of Radio Astronomy by  Thomas Wilson, Kristen Rohlfs and Susanne Huettemeister (Hüttemeister) particularly concise and helpful:     7.5 The Practical Design of Parabolic Reflectors      7.5.1 General Considerations      Measurements of the mechanical properties of an antenna are of importance for its performance. This is especially true if the antenna deforms homologously. By Homology it is meant that, at various elevations, the main reflector deforms from one paraboloid into another. Today, homology is an intrinsic part of the design of all symmetric reflectors.   Later in the same subsection:     The design of an offset paraboloid has, however, complications. Since the design has less symmetry homology is more difficult to achieve and therefore active, real time adjustments of the surface are needed if the design limit of 7 mm or perhaps 3mm wavelength is to be reached. This will be accomplished by an actuator system controlled in real time by a laser measuring system. But for longer wavelengths, the GBT will not require active surface adjustment (Fig. 7.10).   Here is a screen capture of Figure 7.10 from google        note: There are a number of nice photos and some discussion of the Green Bank Telescope and discussion of it's homology (homologusness?) on the NRAO page where I started, as well.  So here is the question-cluster that I'm currently stuck on.  1) If off-axis telescopes require active mechanical adjustments to maintain a homologous paraboloid figure, do the on-axis telescopes mentioned do it passively - by mechanical design alone? They naturally droop - by design - differently at different elevations (different angles above the horizon) in order to retain a paraboloid figure?  2) For the passive design, is it a) the same paraboloid but just a different section, b) or another paraboloid with the same focal point, or c) has a different focal point and therefore requires axial movement of the secondary mirror or feeds?  3) is the nearly-completed 500m dish in China (FAST) a homology telescope? I know it has a lot of articulation and works off axis, but the word spherical is in the name and the receiver/feed translates laterally. Is it still using the principle of homology, but in a different way?    "
1798,Spotting the International Space Station (ISS),"Recently, I visited the NASA website which provides sighting locations to see the International Space Station (ISS). As we all know, we can even see ISS with the naked eye in a clear sky as a passing star without any blinking.  But unfortunately, I don't know how to measure the angle on the sky to see it. On the official NASA website there's given height (altitude) and direction as 21° and 11 above N respectively.  Here is the link: NASA - Spot The Station  How do I trace ISS? "

It links to Gizmodo.au's New South African Telescope Releases Epic Image Of The Galactic Centre.  I have heard of the Meerkat array earlier (Which 16 antenna locations are used for the MeerKAT radio image recently announced?), but I am wondering how to read further about this spectacular image. What is the scale for example? How would it look pasted into the arc of the Milky Way; just a tiny patch of a few arc-minutes, or several tens of degrees?  How will this compare to the radio image of Sag A* that we will see in the next day or two?  Also, if anyone knows, what are those spiky arcs sticking up, and those puff-ball things on the left?

1800,Can a tidally-locked planet maintain an obliquity,"If a planet is tidally-locked, can it have an obliquity?  e.g. the Earth's rotation is being slowed by tidal forces.  A long way in the future it will be tidally locked.  As it slows, will the obliquity also be eroded or will other forces (such as the orbit of the moon) allow it to maintain an obliquity? "
1801,Data Analysis: Image Sharpening through Posterisation,"I had this image, a picture of Jupiter:    I wanted to measure the pixel diameter of Jupiter. As evident, the image is quite blurry, and thus, many value of equally justified pixel diameters can be obtained. To eliminate this I posterised the image (which is technically, quote from Gimp, ""designed to intelligently weigh the pixel colors of the selection or active layer and reduce the number of colors while maintaining a semblance of the original image characteristics""):    With the above result, I obtained three pixel diameters of Jupiter (one from each of the coloured circles), and with a little bit of calculation, realised that the yellow circle gave rise to the most accurate value of Jupiter's diameter (which was surprisingly off by less than one percent!).   My questions are:  1) Why is my original image like that? Is it due to some form of light scattering?  2) Is there a better method of obtaining an accurate pixel diameter than posterising the image  3) Is the posterised result expected? Are there names that can be given to the three distinct spherical objects (which seem to resemble shadows, like the umbra, prenunbra, antumbra, etc.)? Is there a reason why the middle posterised object gives the most accurate value? "
1802,Why aren't stars like Eternally Collapsing Objects?,"We know that stellar radiation pressure balances the gravitational compressive forced of a star. Are there other factors which resist such a collapse? Also, if radiation pressure balances gravitational compression, shouldn't the process of shrinking be a quasistatic process making stars Eternally Collapsing Objects (ECOs)? "
1803,"If the planets only attract, then how can they stay in their orbit?","Gravity is related to mass, and gravity is an attracting force on every body. Then what happens when bodies only attract each other..without repulsion they may strike the sun. I think there must be a repulsive force.   Another question arises, if only attraction is there, then why does the moon rotate elliptically around the earth?  And Mars comes closer to earth after 3 years? "
1804,Is it possible for a moon to continuously have a side facing its star whilst orbiting a planet?,For example; is there any possibility for the moon to always have a side facing the Sun whilst orbiting Earth? And if so then what would the day cycle be like? 
1805,Why is a meteorite impact on the moon visible as white light?,"You can watch a video of a meteorite impacting the moon at the npr.org website.   Why does the impact produce white light?  I understand that the impact is like an explosion, but there is no air on the moon to burn material. If it was the result of superheating rock from the impact, then why does it fade so fast. White light emitted by heated rocks should last longer as it takes time to cool.  We can see meteorites breaking up in Earth's atmosphere as a streak of light, but there is no atmosphere on the moon.  So why isn't it just a big black puff of smoke? "
1806,Future redshifting and effect on the 'pitch' of CMB radiation,"After discovering this question exploring the sound of a blackbody, I started wondering about the sound of the Cosmic Microwave Background radiation from the Big Bang, specifically what the current pitch might be at its peak frequency and how that might evolve over time due to redshifting. Here's what I've been able to deduce so far:  $$ pitch_{CMB} = 160.4\,GHz \approx D_{33} = 157.7\,GHz \\ pitch_{CMB}\,lowered\,by\,30\,octaves = {160.4\, GHz \over 2^{30}} = 149.38\, Hz \approx D_3 = 146.83\,Hz $$  Building on this result:  How much time will need to elapse before the CMB redshift will cause this pitch to drop by an octave (or even by a semitone)? How much variability would this pitch have depending on the dipole anisotropy of the CMB from our perspective as well as due to more generalized anisotropies in the CMB? What pitch would the peak value of this blackbody have had at earlier points in the history of the Universe?   I've tried to apply some of the information in this question and elsewhere, but would greatly appreciate hearing from someone with more expertise in the subject area if this unorthodox comparison has piqued your interest like it has mine. "
1807,Is there an optimum orbit for a hipparcos/GAIA-like parallax observatory,"The GAIA spacecraft is currently mapping the stars in the Milky Way by parallax. It orbits in the Earth-Sun L2 lagrange point. The parallax observed from the spacecraft orbiting around the sun allows us to derive the distances to many stars in the milky way, as well as calculate their velocities.  Assuming no cost to placing such an observatory wherever we want around the sun, what would be the optimal orbit for optimal rate of science gains?  I apologise if this seems a big vague, let me elaborate.  If you imagine placing it in a smaller orbit, the parallax of distant stars (already very small) will be made even smaller. But information about the parallax will be returned quicker.   If you place the observatory in the orbit of Uranus, you'll have a much greater parallax and will be able to measure the distances of distant stars with much greater precision. However, it will take 80 years to complete an orbit, and the rate of distance measuring would be intolerably slow.  Intuitively, I feel like there is some obvious sweet spot that would produce measurements at an acceptable rate, though I also feel like my objective function here is ill-defined.  Would a highly eccentric orbit be preferred to a circular one? Would a particular orbit optimise the 'science gains' for one particular aspect at the expense of others (such as accuracy of nearby stars traded for accuracy of distant stars, or accuracy of stellar proper motion)? If there are multiple objectives to optimise, what would  the tradeoffs be? "
1808,Angle between earth's angular momentum and earth's axis,"I think this picture is correct because for earth astronomical day is slightly shorter than solar day. (Is it a rule of thumb for planets? Where can I read such data?)   Source  So the angle between earth's angular momentum and earth's axis(from south pole to north pole) is 23.5° and not a (180°-23.5°).  That is why observer is standing on the sun in the next picture. And the break in circle-shaped arrows is closer to the sun, then the rest of arrow.  Am I right? Thanks!    Source "
1809,How massive can a cold solid object be?,"I understand that a neutron star is dense enough that adding more matter will increase the amount of degenerate matter directly, and the limit to its size is about 1.4 solar masses.  But if an object were formed not by an explosion that crushes it down to neutron matter, is it necessarily so?  Given normal atoms of any desired species, and it is piled up carefully so it does not get hot. When it gets around one solar mass, will it necessarily collapse into a neutron star, or can it get more massive?  Will such an object eventually collapse catastrophically or can it have a degenerate matter core and a substantial thickness of less-compressed matter on top and normal matter on top of that?  What is the largest possible mass of a cold solid object?  Can it be several solar masses?  By cold I mean that it’s not a star, puffed up by ongoing consumption of energy. Whatever it's made out of is not being “used up”. "
1810,How do tip tilt mirrors correct distortion in adaptive optics?,"I'm currently trying to learn about how adaptive optics correct the blurriness caused by atmospherical seeing effects. This is my current understanding of how adaptive optics works (trying to offer some context, I have a very limited understanding at the moment).   Wavefronts from celestial bodies become distorted as they pass through the Earth's atmosphere due to variations in refraction indices as they pass through different density air, temperature variations and so on. This distortion as far as I know, causes the wavefront to look squiggly instead of being straight parallel lines. Once the light reaches the telescope, it is reflected off a tip tilt mirror, then reflected off a deformable mirror, then a beam splitter splits the light rays and one half is passed through a computer sampling device which detects distortions in the wavefront. This is done up to a 1000 times per second, and somehow the computer causes actuators fitted at the back of the deformable mirror to move such that the reflected light off the deformable mirror is now undistorted (i.e. the wavefronts are a straight line, not squiggly). Thus adaptive optics fixes the distortion issue.   I have a few questions arising from my current understanding:   What exactly does the tip tilt mirror do to help fix the distortion problem? Wiki simply says that it fixes the problem of aberration but doesn't offer a specific explanation of how.  Why are straight wavefronts ideal when viewing celestial bodies? As in, how does the squiggliness of the wavefronts actually make the images look blurry?   I believe I am asking too many different types of questions in one post, so I'll make a separate post for this last question, but for anyone reading this:  I keep reading that increasing the size of the primary mirror will improve resolution. I have seen justification of this using Dawe's limit such as     By considering the formula R= 2.1*10^5*wavelength/ D, where R is the minimum angular separation required by two point sources for them to be resolved, so as primary mirror diameter increases, D increases, so R decreases meaning that resolution of the telescope is improved.   I don't really see how they can apply the R=... formula to primary mirrors because I have only seen it derived in the context of light diffracting when it passes through a small slit, and not mirrors (which don't allow light to pass through, but rather reflects it). Can someone explain to me why we can apply this formula to mirrors as well?  "
1811,Can an amateur astronomer bounce a laser off the moon?,"In the TV show ""Big Bang Theory"" episode ""The Lunar Excitation"", the gang fires a laser from their rooftop, bounces it off mirrors on the moon, and measures the laser coming back on a computer.  Is this really possible?  I know scientists have successfully done this, because it's why NASA put the mirrors on the moon.  Wouldn't this require very precise targeting by the laser to hit the mirrors?  My question is, is it possible for an amateur to successfully perform this experiment? "
1812,Techniques for locating origin of gravitational waves,"The gravity wave detections (GW150914 and GW151226) have both been ambiguous in their exact position, the LIGO papers (GW150914 and GW151226) give no precise information about the location of the origin of the waves.   In the case of GW150914, the approximate location is in the area known as the Magellanic Clouds. In case of GW151226, the parsecs are known, but no precise location. There are two detectors (in Hanford and Livingstone,USA) that made gravitational wave detection possible, does one need a third detector(or more) to pinpoint the position of the origin of these waves?   In other words can triangulation from three detectors pinpoint the location  or are there other techniques for pinpointing the origin of gravitational waves?  "
1813,How to draw an orbit from Orbital Elements using Transform3DGroup,"I am trying to draw an orbit using the Transform3DGroup class in the C# .NET framework. I have orbital elements a, e, i, RAAN, ArgPer, trueAnom. The algorithm that spits these out for me also gives me x y z coordinates in ECI. For some reason, when I try to use Transform3DGroup to do my rotations in order to basically draw out where the satellite is supposed to go in ECI (using the orbit elements I gave above) my result is not matching up with the ECI coordinates that the original algorithm is spitting out.  That original algorithm is my truth data. But I don't want to use those coordinates, I want to draw the orbit myself with the Keplarian elements using Transform3DGroup.  Here is my code:   public Point3D calculatePosition(double trueAnomaly) {     double angle = trueAnomaly;     double a = semiMajorAxis;     double e = eccentricity;     double b = (a * (1 - e * e)) / (1 + e * Math.Cos(angle));     double SA = Math.Sin(angle);     double X = b * CA;//(CA * CR + SA * CI * SR);      double Y = b * SA; //(CA * SR + SA * CI);     double Z = 0; //b * SA * SI;     Point3D p = new Point3D(X, Y, Z);//new Point3D(Math.Cos(angle) * b,      Math.Sin(angle) * b, 0);     return p; } public void orient2OrbitalElements(double _time) {        orbitNorm = new Vector3D(0, 0, 1);     positionPoint = calculatePosition(trueAnomaly);//Position of Orbiter     Transform3DGroup tg = new Transform3DGroup();     tg.Children.Add(new TranslateTransform3D(positionVec));//Translates to Orbit Position (relative to Parent)     tg.Children.Add(new RotateTransform3D(new AxisAngleRotation3D(new Vector3D(1, 0, 0), inclinationDeg)));//Rotates Orbit to the set Inclination     tg.Children.Add(new RotateTransform3D(new AxisAngleRotation3D(new Vector3D(0, 0, 1), RAAN)));//Rotates Orbiter's model RAAN     orbitNorm = tgNoTranslation(tg).Transform(orbitNorm);     tg.Children.Add(new RotateTransform3D(new AxisAngleRotation3D(orbitNorm, argOfPerigee)));//Rotates Orbiter's model to the Arg of Perigee     Transform = tg;     if (HasEphem)     {         Console.WriteLine(ObjectName + "": "" + Transform.Value.OffsetX + "", "" + Transform.Value.OffsetY + "", "" + Transform.Value.OffsetZ);         Console.WriteLine(ObjectName + "": "" + cartesElems.xPos[ephemIndex] + "", "" + cartesElems.yPos[ephemIndex] + "", "" + cartesElems.zPos[ephemIndex]);     } } public Transform3DGroup tgNoTranslation(Transform3DGroup tgWithTranslations) {     Transform3DGroup tempTg = tgWithTranslations.Clone();     tempTg.Children.RemoveAt(0);     return tempTg; }   Basically I calculate an x,y position on the orbital plane w.r.t the Earth position using the basic eccentricity, semi-major axis, true anomaly formula as you'll see. Then I put the resulting coordinates into my Transform3DGroup as a TranslateTransform3D. This is the first object I put in.   Then I perform the rotations:  --- a rotation is added for the inclination, rotating the position Vec about       the unit x axis (1,0,0)  --- a rotation for the RAAN, about the unit z-axis(0,0,1)  --- then I create the orbit normal from that and perform a argPer rotation       about that new axis  My understanding of how Transform3DGroup works is that it will apply the first one, then the second, and so on. Which means that the positionVec (which is just x, y coordinates in the reference frame of the 2d orbital plane) gets performed, then the rotations will all be performed as a rotation matrix on was is left after what was done before it.   Am I performing the argPer rotation incorrectly? RAAN or inc? Perhaps there is a more exact way to calculate my position in my orbital plane or a particular order of operations I must adhere to?   The more I think about it, the more I keep arriving at the thought that everything seems to be very simple if I use the Transform3DGroup and that I should be doing it right at this point, yet the ECI results don't line up.  But lo and behold, the Transform.Value.OffsetX/Y/Z does want to come close to agreeing with the truth data. Perhaps Transform.Value.Offset is not the X,Y,Z as I am thinking of it? "

1815,'Geocentric' view of orbits,Given our real solar system how would planet orbits plot look like if we fix earth in the middle (put earth in the middle and draw a real orbit of a given planet) ?

1816,Non-thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect,"Exactly what is the non-thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect? From what I understand from reading several papers by Mark Birkinshaw and Sergio Colafrancesco, I get the rough idea that the non-thermal SZ effect has something to do with it being in the relativistic realm.   Papers by Sergio Colafrancesco:   Polarization of the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect: relativistic imprint of thermal and non-thermal plasma  The non-thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect in clusters of galaxies Non-thermal phenomena in galaxy clusters: cosmological relevance   Review by Mark Birkinshaw:  The Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect   To clarify, I'm not referring to the kinematic SZ effect.  There appears to be a distinction by the authors between the SZ effect due to hot thermal electrons and relativistic electrons. I find the nomenclature ambiguous, as temperature is essentially kinetic energy on a smaller scale, so why would relativistic electrons that have more kinetic energy be 'non-thermal'?   Lastly, is the key distinction between them using a relativistic vs. a non-relativistic formulation? "
1817,Would our galaxy appear as a spiral when seen from the Andromeda galaxy?,"I'm wondering how our galaxy is tilted with respect to the Andromeda galaxy.

1818,When did the Moon stop?,"According to various theories the Moon was created around 4.5 billion years ago. About all of these theories suggest that it was rotating around its axis at that time though. Currently, Moon is at tidal lock with Earth, despite some monthly ""wiggling"" a flat zero on the long-term rotation speed relative to it.  I wanted to ask when did that stop occur - relative to Moon's age, how long was the period of rotating Moon?  The answer would shed some light on my other question - Why are most lunar maria on the visible side? as Earth tends to catch or deflect many bodies heading for Moon surface from ""our"" direction - still, there is no erosion on the Moon, so craters once formed are extremely slow to vanish - if that period was relatively long, Earth's ""protection"" wouldn't explain the maria, as rotating Moon would get 'cratered' uniformly all over its surface.

1819,"Do white dwarfs lose mass as they fade to black dwarfs? Is there a correlation between temperature, mass, and radius?","I'm having a difficult time understanding certain behaviors of white dwarfs.  I understand how mass is lost in the red giant to white dwarf transition process. I understand that white dwarfs can accumulate mass from a partner binary or some other source and I'm aware of the 1.4 M☉ Chandrasekhar limit. I get that they're not losing all their mass; in general they're just cooling and in the end there will be a lone black chunk of crystallized material floating forever in the void. I know they are really insanely hot when formed and very cold after an unfathomable amount of time. But is it that same, initial mass, or does it somehow diminish?  But is that initial mass the mass the remnant has after its cooled to a black dwarf? I guess what I'm asking is that I'm trying to figure out if there is a correlation between temperature, mass and radius. Some sort of equation? "

1823,Physical measurements and celerity of black hole mergers?,"LIGO detected a black hole merger for bh's of about 30 solar masses, with a schwartzchild radii of about 20km.   Were the gravity waves generated by masses distanced by a few microns or a few kilometers?   A LIGO article states:  The Keplerian effective black hole separation in units of Schwarzschild radii (RS ¼ 2GM=c2) and the effective relative velocity given by the post-Newtonian parameter v=c ¼ ðGMπf=c3Þ1=3, where f is the gravitational-wave frequency calculated with numerical relativity and M is the total mass (FIG. 2.).  They state a relative velocity of 0.4 c for 100ms, can't we compare that to electron orbits or something practical? Electrons travel at 0.01 c. Can we say that the merging masses are 40 times smaller than an H atom?  Can we state that the signal does not continue for an entire minute up to 90Khz, perhaps forever, except that the rest is too faint to detect on LIGO For some reason?  "
1824,Do meteorites streak across the sky in the same direction?,"Once while camping with my family as a child we all watched a meteor shower in the summer (in the month of August).  All the meteorites streaked across the sky in the same direction.  Obviously, this was the result of the Earth passing thru a group of meteors but I've always wondered.  Do meteorites always streak in the same direction? While I know it's not likely to be exactly the same direction, but generally speaking. Would one say meteorites always travel for example: east to west?  I thought this was a plausible fact since the Earth is travelling around the Sun in a constant direction, and additionally it's always rotating in the same direction.  While meteorites can travel in all directions. Does the Earth's gravity pull them straight down towards the surface resulting in the streak to be always in the same direction. "
1825,"""Extinct Species"" of meteorite - how quantitative is the statistical analysis?","This recent paper in Nature A new type of solar-system material recovered from Ordovician marine limestone is available to read on line, and Figure 3 is already widely publicized.       Comparison of Δ17O versus ε54Cr of achondrites, and ordinary chondrites fallen on Earth in recent time with Österplana 065 (Öst 65) and fossil L-chondritic meteorites Österplana 018, 029 and 032 (Öst 18, Öst 29 and Öst 32 in figure). The fields for ordinary chondrites (OC), Mars (SNCs), Earth and earth-likes, Vesta (HEDs), brachinites, ureilites, winonaites (win), acapulcoites (acp)/lodranites/ungrouped achondrites (ung) and a newly identified unique metal-rich chondrite are marked with select representative samples with available data. Symbol colours indicate meteorite type or grouping. Note that the carbonaceous chondrites and affiliated achondrites plot outside the field, with highly positive ε54Cr. The ε54Cr literature values are from refs 12, 18, 19, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, and Δ17O literature values are from refs 10, 12, 25, 30, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43.   The paper is long and careful, and in any scientific field of classification, there is a huge amount of work and thought and discussion that is sometimes difficult for those outside to understand without the necessary background.  The last two sentences of the abstract read:     ""...This may be the first documented example of an ‘extinct’ meteorite, that is, a meteorite type that does not fall on Earth today because its parent body has been consumed by collisions. The meteorites found on Earth today apparently do not give a full representation of the kind of bodies in the asteroid belt ~500 Myr ago.""   In this part of the image, without knowing a lot about meteorite taxonomy but a little bit about error bars, the image alone doesn't convince me of much at all by itself. There are good mathematical techniques to try to find clustering in data, and probably some methodologies to apply to calculate the probability that the clustering is likely to arise by random chance or is likely to be ""real"" (which is just another way to say - albeit loosely - not likely to arise by random chance).    I'm guessing those colorized islands probably come from statistical analysis of a very large number of meteorites, but I don't know that for sure.  Are these color islands generally accepted and their shapes published independently somewhere? Is there a plot where I can see all of the points that were used to identify these clustering? How exactly were these contours drawn?  Finally, is there a statistical analysis using these error bars and contours that express the probability that the extinct meteorite specimen described in the paper is part of the distribution or not? Of course a number by itself is weak because of the softness of the assumptions, but is there one and if so how was it calculated? "
1826,What does a black dwarf look like?,"A black dwarf is a hypothetical object that is the end result of the cooling of a white dwarf. None yet exist, because there hasn't been enough time in the age of the universe for them to cool down sufficiently. The oldest known white dwarfs are at ~3800 K and would glow orange. It will take many billions of years before any are cool enough (~750 K I believe) to not emit light visible to the naked eye.  So, what would a black dwarf look like? I'm assuming it is illuminated by some other source of light such as a star.   The question could be rephrased: What is the visible absorption (and emission) spectrum of electron degenerate matter?  This is my attempt at an answer: Probably not black. A lot would depend on whether electron-degenerate matter behaves as metallic or dielectric, based on its band-structure. My guess would be metallic, considering the electrons are dissociated from their parent nuclei in electron-degenerate matter.  Because the surface gravity of a black dwarf would be so strong, I'd expect the surface to be very smooth and relatively free of Lambertian scattering.   From these two features, I'd make a tentative prediction that a black dwarf would appear as a mirror-like sphere.  "
1827,Is Earth's 1g solid surface gravity unusually high for exoplanets?,"The surface gravities of the Sun’s planets are all close to 1g, 0.38-2.53 (about a factor of e, by chance). The cloud-top gravity of the gas giants is not too interesting here, but I suppose that the gravity on their solid surfaces (if any) does not tend to be higher. So called super-Earth exoplanets seem likely to generally accumulate light gas atmospheres, which decreases their expected solid surface gravity relative to their size as measured during for example transits (I suppose so anyway).  Are there good reasons to expect that in the zoo of planets in the universe, our Earth scores high in the surface gravity top-list? That it is unusual with solid real estate to stand on which has substantially (as in a factor of a few tenths) greater gravity than we have here?  Surface gravities from Wikipedia:   Mercury  0.38 Venus    0.90 Earth    1.00 Mars     0.38 Jupiter  2.53 Saturn   1.07 Uranus   0.89 Neptune  1.14  "
1828,Is it possible to be 'still' in space?,"So I was reading this answer about how galaxies are the fastest moving objects in the universe because space is expanding faster than the speed of light.

If possible I would also like to have the coordinates and brightness (and any other interesting info) for each of these star. But just the list of identifiers would be great.  Does such data exist somewhere? Ideally I can just download a simple file (like a csv) and I can write my own software to process it without fiddling with some other software.

1839,Question from Introduction to Modern Cosmology by Andrew Liddle,"The exact question goes like this: In the real Universe the expansion is not completely uniform. Rather, galaxies exhibit some random motion relative to the overall Hubble expansion, known as their peculiar velocity and caused by the gravitational pull of their near neighbours. Supposing that a typical (e.g. root mean square) galaxy peculiar velocity is 600 km s-1, how far away would a galaxy have to be before it could be used to determine the Hubble constant to ten per cent accuracy, supposing  (a) The true value of the Hubble constant is 100 km s-1 Mpc-1?  (b) The true value of the Hubble constant is 50 km s-1 Mpc-1  Assume in your calculation that the galaxy distance and redshift could be measured exactly. Unfortunately, that is not true of real observations.  I started off by writing the hubbles equation and as they mentioned it should be accurate to 10% so its peculiar velocity (given as about 600 km/s) is less than or equal to 10% of its expansion velocity. But this gives me different answer.  The actual answer to the problem as stated in the book is Slightly different answers are possible depending how you deal with the rms velocity. You should get something like r > 35 Mpc for H0 = 100km s-1 and r > 70Mpc for Ho = 50kms-1  What am I missing here? Has it got to do with the RMS velocity as mentioned? Please explain.  "

However, I've ended with a shot but I have no idea where I pointed my camera at, and because of the narrow angle of 200mm, I'm lost without any guiding star/object.  This happened to me before too, so I was wondering whether there is a software or a website that I can upload a photo, and it will analyze the objects, cross match them with known objects and detect which part of the sky it is?

1844,"What abbreviations, letters, or symbols do we use to denote highly degenerate stars?","We have OBAFGKM to denote the strength of hydrogen lines.  Apparently we added S, N, C, and the W classes when we learned of new kinds of stars.  We use T, L, and Y to denote brown dwarfs.  The D classes refer to electron-degenerate stars (white dwarfs).  I've looked around quite a bit and I haven't seen anything regarding neutron stars and black holes. Does this mean there's no common symbol or abbreviation? What do they use in star catalogs? (I've never found a catalog with stars of all degeneracies in it.) "
1845,Why do stars become red giants?,"Disclaimer: I’m not a career astronomer.  I don’t own a telescope.  I have no professional credentials.  But I do find this stuff fascinating, and I consume all the astronomy documentaries I can.      So, I’ve watched lots of documentaries describing stellar evolution.  I understand that below a certain threshold, stellar death does not involve supernovae.  I understand that above that threshold, supernovae may create neutron stars, magnetars, or (if the supernova qualifies as a hypernova) black holes.  However, for a long time, I was curious about why stars below the supernova threshold—like our own Sun—become Red Giants.    From documentaries, I have been instructed that (for stars below the supernova threshold), when the star’s core’s fusion cannot continue…fusion ceases, and the star begins to collapse under gravity.    As gravity crushes the star, I understand that the star heats up as gravity crushes it.  As a result, although the stellar core remains “dead” (no fusion occurs), a “shell” of gas around the stellar core becomes hot enough to begin fusing helium.  Since the fusion occurs as a “shell” around the stellar core, the outward-push from the fusion is what pushes the star’s outer layers further.  The result is that the star grows into a Red Giant.    My question is this:  Why does fusion cease in the core?!  It seems to me that as gravity crushes the star, stellar fusion would reignite in the core itself—not in a sphere around the core.  Why does the stellar core remain “dead” while its “shell” begins fusion??? "
1846,Shared moon in a double planet system,"Would it be possible for two planets orbiting around each other to share a moon that orbits both separately? Would the moon in question would do something akin to a large figure 8 as it orbited both or would this be possible in the first place?  Also, what effects might we see on the planets because of this?  (Side note: This stems from a Worldbuilding question, but I figured I would ask the astronomy question on the Astronomy StackExchange) "
1847,Earth's gravitational pull on ISS,How do they make International space station to orbit the earth beyond earth's gravity acting on it? We all know that ISS is rotating at an altitude of just 350km away.How could ISS escape earth's gravitational pull? 
1848,Black dwarf binary systems,"I know black dwarf stars do not exist yet, and that they are what white dwarfs end up after a long time. The question is really simple: would it be possible to have a binary system in which one of the two is a black dwarf, and the other companion star is dumping mass on the black dwarf, causing the black dwarf to supernova? I guess based on the timescales, the maximal initial mass of the second object could be calculated to see if it is possible that one object is at the black dwarf stage and the other still a giant. Or is the timescale on which the star goes from white dwarf to black dwarf big enough that it will never reach the black dwarf stage while the other one is still an AGB star?   Second part: If not possible that one is black dwarf and the other AGB star, is it possible if the companion is a brown dwarf, that they are close binary, and that a brown dwarf would dump mass on a black dwarf? This would need the binary system to be a very close binary system at this stage of the system.   Third part of the question: would the spectrum of the supernova be any different from the normal one with a white dwarf and a companion AGB star? I guess the spectral lines would be different, since the companion would have to be a very low-mass AGB star, since that companion would be about 20billion years or so, when the black dwarf star becomes a black dwarf. "
1849,First time visit to dark sky stargazing site: what do I need?,"Complete newbie here. I have an opportunity to visit one of the few designated dark sky sites here in Pennsylvania, Cherry Springs State Park. I plan on camping out over night, but I have never gone stargazing before, don't use a telescope, and I don't know what the protocols are as far as binoculars? glasses? Etc. for viewing the night skies. The park allows no lights, save for flashlights covered with red tint. Is there anything else that you more experienced astronomers would suggst that I need to have with me? What should I bring? What should I expect for my first observation tour ever? Thank you. "
1850,Galactic Habitable Zone,"Do galaxies have habitable zones the same as stars do? Say in a galaxy with a very active nucleus producing a lot of heat and radiation, would there be a point at which no star's planets could harbor life do to the effects of the black hole? Also would there possibly be a habitable zone for galaxy clusters? If there were many galaxies with extremely active galactic nuclei condensed closely together would this possibly also hinder the evolution of life?  "
1851,During night on the Moon is there Earth light and Earth phases?,"I realise that night time on the Moon is two weeks, however I am curious if during the night there, whether or not the Earth reflects light in similar manner to the Moon.   On the one hand, I know it must (as seen in photographs from astronauts), but what I'm really wanting to know is:  Does the Earth have phases like the Moon and do they work in a similar manner for an observer on the Moon?  I assume the Earth isn't as reflective as the Moon since the Moon is much lighter in colour, however the Earth is also fairly larger, does this make any difference in the amount of light reflected?  Finally, if the Earth does appear in phases, does that mean that the two week long nights on the Moon are sometimes pitch black (new Earth) and sometimes less than pitch black (full Earth)? "
1852,regarding spectral type of a star,"consider two stars of the spectral type and subtype, but not necessarily both on the main sequence. Describe whether this information is sufficient to tell you how the stars differ in surface temperature, size, and distance?  so if they have they same spectral type and subtype i think they're supposed to have the same surface temperature. however this is not enough information to tell us about their sizes and distances. is this correct? any insight would be great, thanks! "
1853,What are the differences between TESS and PLATO exoplanet telescopes?,"Within a year now it has been decided to launch TESS in 2017 and PLATO in 2024, space telecopes of NASA and ESA. They seem to have very similar science goals, both searching for transiting Earth sized planets in the HZ of the brighest (nearest) stars across all or most of the sky.   Are these missions as overlapping as they seem on first sight, or are there important complementarities? Is it perhaps the intention for PLATO to continue the observations of the planets discovered by TESS in order to get a longer time series? "
1854,Do the E and B modes of the CMB polarization have anything to do with electric and magnetic fields?,"As explained in this article, as the CMB is created from a vaiable (matter?) density [tex] its gradient [tex] can be separated into a gradient and curl part, called the [tex] and [tex] modes  $$ \nabla^2 \kappa^E = \nabla \cdot \vec{u}  $$  and   $$ \nabla^2 \kappa^B = \nabla \times \vec{u} $$  Thinking about electromagnetism, these definitions look slightly (but not exactly) familiar, if the vector [tex] would take the role of the electromagnetic potential [tex].  Is the similarity to the terminology of electromagnetism just a coincidence, or do these [tex] and [tex] modes have indeed something to do with electric and magnetic fields ? "
1855,How easy is it to mine water on Ceres?,"It has been suggested by some futuristic or sci fi leaning thinkers, that Ceres' surface might be mined for water to support human exploration and settlement of space. But NASA's Dawn mission and other observations show that it is very dark and seems to consist of ""hydrated minerals"" in an environment warm enough to make water ice sublimate. Does this mean that mining water on Ceres is really hard? Requiring deep drilling or excavating through thick hard surface layers before useful water ice is encountered.  Could a lander on Ceres just heat up the surface and collect water sublimating from it? "
1856,Do magnetic fields affect planetary rings?,"Planetary rings seem to generally form on the ecliptic plane because of the rotation of the planet, but I was wondering what kind of effect the magnetic field of the planet might have on the ring system. Would it help keep the ring system together, disrupt it, or have little to no effect? What if the magnetic poles were on or near the ecliptic? "
1857,Max. speed that a space probe can communite with the Earth?,Question: Which is the average or maximum speed of a telematically sent message that a space probe can send? Is as simple as radio waves travel at the speed of light in a vacuum?  Context: I have been asked to make a first estimation about how much time is needed to send a space probe and then receive the signal.   I am supposing that the space probe is sent at [tex] but I have not idea of the telematic signal speed.   Thank you in advance!  
1858,Which structure is represented in this video (if any)?,I know this is not supposed to be precise since it is just a movie but I would suppose it is based on real things. In the Contact movie intro [website]
1859,Do narrow lines in the spectra of O- and B- type stars always indicate magnetic fields?,"I was reading a paper on the differential emission measures of a set of hot O- and B- type stars. As the authors discuss in Section 3 (page 959), two stars, [tex] Sco and [tex] Ori C, have narrow emission lines compared to other stars of the same spectral type. There is a good amount of evidence that both stars are young and have magnetic fields; the stellar winds travel along the field lines and collide at the magnetic equator, producing shocks and, indirectly, X-ray emission. This is in contrast to the mechanism behind shock formation in other O- and B- type stars, where shocks come from the line instability transition.  Now, the plasma at the magnetic equator is roughly stationary because of the collision; this means - if I'm interpreting things correctly - that there is little to no broadening of the lines, and so they are comparatively narrow. Other spectral characteristics and observations support this model.  I'm wondering two things:   Has the presence of such comparatively narrow lines in the spectra of O- and B- type stars been observed in cases where there is no magnetic field present? Very few O-type stars have significant magnetic fields, and theory predicts that none should, so these stars are the few exceptions to the rule. If so, are there other mechanisms that could be responsible for this in cases without magnetic fields? I'm grasping at straws for ideas, like low collisional broadening.     I talked with my advisor, and we briefly discussed colliding wind shocks (CWS), which form at the interface between the stellar winds in a binary system. It's thought that these shocks contribute only a small amount to the total X-ray production of the system (see Gagné et al. (2011)), though, so any narrow lines produced in that plasma - if any exist - wouldn't have much influence over the measured spectra. So that seems to be ruled out. "
1860,How to calculate the angle formed between 2 planets?,"I am interested in calculating the angles formed between planets like Saturn opposite to Neptune - 180 degrees, PlanetX opposite/trine/square to PlanetY. How to find such degrees?  I use Stellarium software to find positions of planets. Here I am adding positions of Saturn, Jupiter and Sun.        Stellarium shows information about selected objects, can it be used to calculate angle formed, for example, angle formed between Saturn and Jupiter taking Sun as reference point? "
1861,Are large body orbits self correcting?,If a rogue planet disrupts Earth's orbit slightly to cause a long winter or summer will the Earth's orbit normalize back close its original orbit over time? Could a Planet X or some other elliptical orbit large body revolving around the sun effect Earth's orbit by being inside the inner solar system?  
1862,How did astronomers determine the path of 'Oumuamua so quickly?,"The interstellar asteroid 'Oumuamua was discovered on October 19, 2017. Once discovered, less than a month's worth of precovery observations were found on various sky surveys. By mid-November, scientists had worked out its orbital eccentricity, and soon after its probable origin and destination.  With such a quick visit and so little data, how did scientists figure out so quickly where it came from and where it was going? Did using space probes for observations impart enough parallax to easily determine that, or did Earth-based observation have enough parallax themselves? "
1863,Where do asteroids impact upon the Earth most often?,"Where do asteroids impact upon the Earth most often?  Are impact zones primarily along the equator?  Is there an average area where impacts are more likely to occur?  If there is a zone, is there a way to determine if it's changed? More to the point, if there is an impact zone, are there any similar areas that might indicate the zone has shifted? "
1864,"Has the conjunction between Venus, Jupiter, and Regulus only occurred twice in 2,000 years?","I recently heard the claim that mid-July, the ""Star of Bethlehem"" formed for the first time in 2,000 years, where the Star of Bethlehem is a three-way conjunction between Venus, Jupiter, and Regulus. The Wikipedia page I just linked mentions one such conjunction occurring in 2 BC, and other sources (like EarthSky) mention the conjunction that happened last month, in 2015 AD. Has this three-way conjunction never happened in the intervening 2016 years?  (For the purpose of this question, I'll say that it counts as a conjunction when each pair of bodies is separated by no more than 10 degrees, as suggested by this CosmoQuest forum thread on the subject.) "
1865,Is thermal disintegration of meteorites variable with lattitude?,"If meteorites and bolides are aligned to the solar system,  then do they have twice as much atmosphere to go through at high latitudes?   Wouldn't we expect a higher percentage of metal meteorites further from the equator,  because they disintegrate slower in prolonged atmospheric traversal?  Image from: [website][website]"
1866,"Is Mars brightest from Earth at opposition, perihelion or somewhere in between?","After reading this article, I was inspired to run some simulations at NASA's JPL Solar System Simulator to see Earth's and Mars' orbits from above.  From what I could visually determine (from the JPEG images), Mars is at opposition on July 26, but its perihelion is sometime around September.  When (and where in their orbits) is Mars brightest from Earth this year? "
1867,How loud would a black hole be?,"If we could hear black holes, how loud would they be? I know that this is basically the same question as the question ""How loud would the Sun be?"", except this time there is a black hole. But since the black hole sucks in stuff like a passenger jet engine sucks in air, about how many decibels would it be? Also, would it lethal to humans if we were 1 AU away and what would it do to our planet? "
1868,What does gravity-wave noise resemble locally?,"Now that we know that gravity waves exist,  we can consider to design a new unit of measurement,  i.e.  deciGravs (from dB) and we can predict what the backround noise of dG's is locally and in space.   Consider a theoretical high-res LIGO that can graph gravity waves here and far away,  we can ffwd the record to represent the dG's at human timeframes.   What are the loudest local waves? Can we see the moon as the loudest local wave,  followed by other planets and moons,  are local bodies much louder than local bh waves?   There is an expected 3D wave map type locally and in deep space that we can model with graphical animations? Can we draw it easily in 2D/3Dusing 5 lines of code for every body and lots of processing?  Perhaps it makes sense to define a frequency chart of dG's and astroHz and a bit like the electromagnetic waves,  and chart gravity-waves,  amplitude and frequency trends and types?  Perhaps supernovas and solar flares and many background waves appear on graviCharts.  Can we know what graviCharts and backround noise of gravity resembles here and far away? "
1869,need data-point: actual counts per second with APD (avalanche photodiode) detector,"I'm designing a sensor system to perform specialized [astronomy and space-sciences] experiments, and need a ""reality check"" to support or adjust my theoretical calculations.  What I need is the ""counts per second"" produced by any modern APD (avalanche photo-diode) sensor through a telescope of any specific ""aperture"" of a star of any ""visual magnitude"".  I also need the number of ""counts per second"" of ""nothing"" (the ""dark count"") to subtract that from the ""counts per second"" when illuminated by the star (to determine the ""counts per second"" generated by the star alone).  This ""reality check"" will help me assure various ""inefficiency allowances"" I made are realistic.  Examples:  #1: overall detector QE over relevant visual [and near IR] wavelengths. #2: loss of light in atmosphere before entering telescope. #3: loss of light in telescope optics. #4: loss of light in fiber (if any). #5: anything/everything else.   As implied, I am only interested in the APD operating in ""photon counting mode"" (not analog).  I've read about 5 dozen articles that discuss APDs for astronomy, but none give a straightforward value.  The closest I found was a vague statement that the limited magnitude was 22nd magnitude on a 6-meter telescope based upon observations of the crab nebula pulsar.  But this is not specific and the object is highly variable (on a short time frame).  They did not say, for example, whether they consider their ""limiting magnitude"" is where the count rate rises from 200 per second (dark count) to 220 per second (measurement), or 200cps to 400cps, or over what time period, or any other indication of their definition.  All I need is ONE clear statement of cps for any aperture and visual magnitude star.  You'd think I could find that in dozens if not hundreds of articles, but... no.  Probably a clear statement like I need exists in some article somewhere, but I haven't seen one.  Have you?  Or better yet, have you made such an observation yourself?  The following detail is not very important (but just to be complete), my primary applications perform fairly high time-resolution measures on fairly bright stars.  In other words, the experiments generally need to measure in the range of ""counts per microsecond"" to ""counts per millisecond"".  Typically APDs max out at around 15 to 50 million counts per second, and most of my experiments will be working at 10K to 10M counts per second to observe the short time-period phenomenon I need to measure. "
1870,Terminology of Orbits,"A hopefully simple terminology question:  When you have an object that orbits another object in space, what do you call the object being orbited in relation to the object orbiting?  For instance, you might call the object orbiting the ""satellite"" of the orbited object, but what would you call the object being orbited?    Orbitee is all i've been able to come up with but it doesn't seem quite right ;) "
1871,Why are most planetary orbits nearly circular,"In our solar system, with the exception of Pluto all planets follow a relatively circular orbit around the Sun, at the same inclination. They also all rotate in the same direction, none are 'retrograde'.    An image of the orbits of our solar system.  How and why have they all formed into these orbits? Is this reflected in most orbital systems? What factors affect the orbits of newly formed systems? "
1872,What exactly does outer space contain?,"Does outer space contain any gases? Recently i watched a video on youtube,in which NASA installs a camera on a spacecraft.The footage shows some dust particles or some matter floating over the space craft's surface and as well from the thrust.What exactly is that? If there is nothing in vacuum,how come newton third law works out to make it move in turn? Here is the link  [website]"
1873,What causes Earth's gravity?,"Why Earth is like a magnet? how can earth attract any object irrespective of what it is made of? What is the reason behind Celestial Body's gravity? i.e Sun,Jupiter,Moon etc. "
1874,What's the profound reason(s) why the star formation rate drives the scatter of the mass-metallicity relation in galaxies?,"Since decades it's well known that a correlation between stellar mass and metallicity (Z; both stellar and gas-phase Z, but here I focus on the gas-phase Z) exists (e.g., Tremonti+04; analysis of >53000 galaxies from SDSS). More recent results have shown that the scatter of this ""mass-Z"" relation is mainly driven by the star formation rate (SFR; e.g., Mannucci+10), i.e., at a fixed stellar mass, galaxies with higher SFRs have lower Z. This happen systematically over a wide range of stellar masses. What's the physical mechanism(s) responsible for that?  Also, even more recently (e.g., Bothwell+16) it has been shown that the ""real"" driver of the ""mass-Z"" relation's scatter is the molecular gas mass (the previously found dependence on SFR may be only a by-product of the Schmidt-Kennicutt relation between gas and SFR).  How this would change the interpretation of the first problem? "
1875,Does the CMB pattern evolve in a human lifetime?,"I was thinking, as CMB is a snapshot of a slice of the Universe during recombination, how much the cmb is changing with time ? I mean as we progress in time we look a CMB a bit more faraway each time, could this effect be seen and could we watch the pattern of CMB anisotropies changing with time (on a ""human"" timescale I mean) ?  "
1876,Why does time get slow near a black hole?,Why exactly does time get slow around a black hole? And does it provide a way to go into the future? 
1877,Why Earthian atmosphere is so thin?,"Venus is somewhat lighter then Earth, yet has a much thicker atmosphere. One would imagine that the following should be true:   During the formation phase, all inner planets had captured as much gas as they could hold per gravitational/thermodynamic equilibrium. After all, even puny Mars managed to capture a sizable atmosphere. The rate of atmospheric escape should be much higher for Venus:   Venus receives more heat from the sun, thus higher Jeans escape rate Venus has negligible magnetic field, so some of its atmosphere must be lost to direct ""blow-off"" by solar wind    Yet, it is Earth that seemingly misses a great deal of atmospheric volume. So the question is: what are the current theories regarding the ""thinning"" of the Earthian atmosphere? When and why the atmospheric gases had left the planet? "
1878,Why can primordial tensor perturbations of the CMB be ascribed to gravitational waves?,"Why can primordial tensor perturbations of the CMB be ascribed to gravitational waves? Is this attribution unique, or are there other mechanisms that could lead to the excitation of tensor modes?  In an explanation I have read recently that gravitational waves turn the E-modes into the now observed B-modes somehow, but I don't understand this. So can somebody give a more detailed explanation of this interaction of gravitational waves with the CMB?  LaTeX and equations are welcome and appreciated :-) "
1879,How many galaxies can be seen in a given patch of sky,"Similar to the question asked here, but my question is not about what can be seen with the naked eye but rather what might be seen if pointing my Newtonian reflector (full specs outlined below) at an average point in the sky. (This is why my questions is different from the potential duplicate...)  I was doing this last night because it was cloudless and ok seeing, and whenever I point the scope at a given patch of sky I always see a much larger amount of objects (obviously) but how many of these additional dots are galaxies and how many are just nearby red dwarfs or average but more distant stars in the milky way?  Do galaxies ever appear as points of light similar to faint stars, or are they always more diffuse like Andromeda is through binoculars or my telescope? To be clear here, I'm not talking about the galaxies in our local group that are close enough to be discernable as actually fuzzy objects, but rather more distant galaxies that might be very bright (i.e. large elliptical galaxies). I feel as though I'm answering my own question here and that galaxies are only seen as diffuse objects and not points of light, but I can't think of a good way to test this hypothesis with my equipment.  Assume ideal conditions (low light pollution, perfect seeing, etc.) although I am also curious to know how much this changes if the light pollution conditions worsen, particularly in my backyard. For reference, I can somewhat make out the milky way on a cloudless, moonless night. Andromeda is not visible without small binoculars on any night here (or it is and my eyes just aren't trained enough to find it without them).  A better way to phrase my question might be this. Imagine if I were to remove all the stars in the milky way so that the only objects in the night sky were other galaxies. How densely populated with the sky be to the naked eye, and how densely populated would it be through my telescope?  Thanks for taking to the time to read my question(s)! I hope to be able to give my own answers one day. Clear skies everyone.  Telescope specs: NexStar 130mm Aperature: 130mm Focal Length: 650mm Eyepiece: 9mm, 1.25"" Plossl "
1880,"What exactly is the ""paradox"" in Olber's Paradox?","To the extent of my understanding, Olber’s paradox states that if the universe was static and homogeneous, we should see a star at every point in the night sky and therefore the night sky should be equally as bright as day.  However, since the night sky is dark and non-uniform, it can be said that the universe is not static and not homogeneous. However, if this was already known, what exactly is the “paradox”? Why isn’t it called Olber’s Observation or something else? "
1881,Why did the Event Horizon Telescope take so long to take a photo of a black hole?,The Event Horizon Telescope is in the news now because they are about to release the first ever picture of a black hole. They have been working on this since 2006. Why did it take 13 years to produce the first picture? What was the critical mass that was recently hit that made the picture now complete? 
1882,What mechanism causes oscillations of the solar system's orbit about the galactic plane?,"In a recent paper (news release here) Lisa Randall and Matthew Reece propose that a dark matter disk coinciding with the galactic plane together with the solar system's oscillations through the galactic plane could explain the 35 million year periodicity in mass extinctions.  They propose that the solar system passes through this dark matter disk in the galactic plane every 35 million years, disrupting bodies in the Oort cloud and causing some of them to collide with Earth.  An image of the proposed cycles from the news release is below.  My question is: What mechanism is responsible for this 35 million year oscillation about the galactic plane?  Is there a companion body to the sun? Are we orbiting around one of the arms of our galaxy?  Is this a well known phenomenon or are they proposing the 35 million year oscillation as well as the dark matter disk?   "

1884,Question about the formation of elements,"So, elements such as iron, gold, etc. are formed from different types of supernovas, whether it's type 1A or 2. My question is, is it possible that there are elements that are formed that we never received during the formation of Earth and that we are unaware of? Or have we discovered every non man-made element? "
1885,Is it practical to build a giant telescope in Moon? (Considering the fact that the atmosphere of moon is very rare),"China's FAST (Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope) is the largest radio telescope in the world.(This is huge!!!)   As we all know Space Telescopes are better than Earth-Based telescopes always.(Hubble space telescope was such a tremendous success)Even though ground-based observatories are usually located in highly elevated areas with minimal light pollution, but still they contend with atmospheric turbulence, which limits the sharpness of images taken from this vantage point.  What if all the space agencies collaborate together to build a telescope half the size of China's FAST in moon(Even smaller than half),even then it will be more powerful than the ""FAST"" right(because the atmosphere of moon is very less dense)?Will it be impractical?It may take decades to build one but still the outcome will be huge(We may even look and find aliens!!)  (Taking in account that Elon Musk is already planning Colonization of Mars)This project looks somewhat tamable than that,right?  Is there a possibility of this happening? Is it feasible enough? "
1886,"What is exactly the ""longitude of the perigee""","Some moon phase calculation algorithms (apparently derived from Duffet-Smith's book, example here) seem to use a parameter called ""longitude of perigee at epoch"". What exactly is this?  Can I assume this is the same as the longitude of the periapsis? Can I just calculate it adding the longitude of the ascending node and the argument of periapsis together?  Unfortunately, all the data that I find on this parameter is either related to Duffet-Smith's book or algorithms based on it. So, I have no idea on how this can be calculated for a specific epoch. "

1891,"Is there a fundamental difference between a small galaxy, and a large star cluster?","For instance, If a large globular cluster were somehow ejected from its galaxy, and was observed by astronomers, would they call it a galaxy, or would there be characteristics of the star cluster that make it obviously not a galaxy by definition? And why are the Magellanic Clouds dwarf galaxies, and not large star clusters? Could we remove stars until the Magellanic clouds became star clusters, or is there something intrinsically galaxy like about these objects?   "

I mean why it happened, what must be the circumstances or what made it happened? "
1894,How can the Event Horizon Telescope image Sgr A* when it's not visible from all sites at one time?,"I went to [website]I made a little script also shown below with approximate coordinates, and saw that Sgr A* is at a declination of about -29.5 degrees (South).  I spun it around the earth, calculated the dot product between each of the sites' position vectors and all normals pointing to Sgr A* as it rotates around the Earth.  I then plotted the elevation angle above the horizon for all ten sites. I was quite surprised!   Sgr A* is never above the horizon for the Greenland telescope!

What are the decimals following the 66? Most of my values that I'm working with are similar to the one I give, so which ecliptic pole, if any, does this correspond to?) How would I find this angle, I need a convenient formula (such as a dot product to find this angle). Thank you! "
1896,Why is gravity only an attractive force?,"As per the universal law of attraction, any two bodies (having some mass) experience a force of 'attraction' which is proportionate to ...and ...inverse proportionate ....  Then comes my question: Why it should be force should be of type 'attraction' only ?  Why it should not be repulsion / any other kind of force ? "
1897,M87 Black hole. Why can we see the blackness?,"So, as the title states, why are we able to actually see the 'blackness' of the black hole? I get that what we are actually seeing is the event horizon, or accretion disk. But should this not extend all the way round? Surely the black hole is not a 2D thing so we can ""look into it from above"" (I use that term loosely as obviously there are no directions in space!), so why are we able to actually see the blackness?  The only thing I can think of is that a black hole, much like our solar system has some sort of ecliptic, that the vast majority of matter is orbiting, and everywhere else just doesn't have enough matter for the light to be visible, kind of like why we are unable to see the Oort cloud.   I hope that made sense, and I could be way off, but it is the only thing I could think of to explain it. If it is the case, then would we be able to get a similar image of Sagittarius A, seeing as we could be in this ""ecliptic"" of it, so surely we would only be able to see the heated matter around the event horizon and not the blackness? "
1898,Has New Horizon's data updated Charon's orbital elements?,"For years I've been fascinated with the mutually tide-locked bodies Pluto and Charon. In July 2012, The Astronomical Journal published an article The Orbit of Charon Is Circular by Buie, Tholen and Grundy. The authors thought that the eccentricity of Charon's orbit is very close to zero.  It seems to me their opinion is somewhat speculative given the low quality of images from Hubble. Has New Horizons data verified Charon's circular orbit? Is there an online source giving more precise orbital elements from New Horizons data?  I'm also interested in the obliquity of Pluto and Charon. "
1899,What will happen to life on Earth when the Andromeda and Milky Way galaxies collide?,"It is said that the Andromeda and Milky Way galaxies are coming close to each other with a speed of approximately 400000 km/hour. They will be together in the next 4 billion years.   What will happen to life on Earth or human beings on Earth? If we are about to collide in the next 4 billion years then how long before we should take action for interstellar voyage? Are scientists working on such projects for an interstellar voyage? Will we be able to get the something like Earth to go away from this galaxy/Earth/ solar system and, considering speed of human instruments/spaceships, how long will it take to go to a safe place?  "
1900,Does gravitational lensing provide time evolution information?,"When we see multiple images of the same object because of the phenomenon of gravitational lensing, do all the images show the lensed object at the same point in time?  Does it take the same amount of time for light from the lensed object to reach us no matter what image we look at or are we watching the lensed object at different points in time and if so, how big can the difference in time typically be? "
1901,How much illumination do the background stars provide?,"I'm trying to get a better understanding of what things look like in ""outer space."" The main problem I'm trying to solve right now, is how much illumination is provided by the background stars. Is it even perceivable? If we were to ignore the light contributions from our sun and local planets, how difficult would it be to see an object (within arm's reach) that was lit only by the remaining ambient light?  Another way this might be thought of is: how dark is the dark side of Pluto? If a person were able to stand on the surface of Pluto, would a moonless/Charonless night be totally pitch black, or would there be enough ambient light to see? How bright might that be?  EDIT: The example about Pluto is a little deceptive because Pluto will block a large portion of starlight. I'm thinking of the starlight that is neither blocked by nor supplemented by any of the bodies in our solar system. "
1902,Did atoms in human body indeed come from stars?,"I think I am not alone who saw videos about that we (humans) are made of same atoms which someday were in stars. In other words, some atoms in our bodies are from stars which exploded billions of years ago.  I wonder if it is indeed true. I mean human's life begins when sperm cell fertilize egg cell. Now does that sperm cell or egg cell indeed contains some of the exact atoms from those stars?   I know little bit strange question, but would be interesting to hear if it is indeed true, that atoms in our body are same which someday were in stars.  In case you are wondering that's the video I am talking about: [website]"
1903,What is the orientation of the M87 black hole image relative to the jet?,"On the image of the M87 black hole released today by the Event Horizon Telescope team, which direction points towards the jet? Is it on the brighter side of the ring?  To resolve ambiguity, I'm talking about the main observed jet, not the fainter counterjet. "
1904,Why is only a narrow chunk of sky darkened in this amazing Curiosity solar eclipse GIF from Mars?,"I found three NASA JPL images in the sequence PIA23133, PIA23134, and PIA23135. They were taken by the Curiosity Rover on Mars and show solar eclipses by Mars' two moons.   Details of these images are given in this answer to Puzzler: help understanding these amazing Curiosity eclipse GIFs   Question: Why is it that it's mostly a chunk of the right half of the sky that darkens during the eclipse in PIA23135?   Is this kind of effect visible in solar eclipses seen on Earth?  Enquiring minds want to know!  fyi in case you are wondering, per @MarkAdler's ultra-concise answer     They use neutral-density filters to look at the Sun, which reduce the light by a factor of 100,000. The two Pancam cameras each have one neutral-density filter, with the left one filtering blue and the right one filtering red.

1905,Do solstices and equinoxes shift over time?,"Right now, I think the winter solstice is around December 21. Has it always been around this date constantly?  Since the earth's axis's 23.45° tilt will be on the exact opposite side in 13000 years (or was 13000 years ago) due to precession, it'd seem like the seasons would flip every 13000 years. So, +/- 13000 years from now, it would've turned summer around December 21 in the Northern Hemisphere, right? "
1906,Why does the axial tilt & the rotation speed of Saturn & Jupiter vary so much?,"I have seen Jupiter and its 4 largest moons in a telescope, several times. The moons are always aligned in a line. This is fine. Very interesting. But.. in case of Saturn, not only that we can see its ring, moons are not aligned in a line. I was wondering why is it so and I came to a conclusion that Saturns axial tilt must be bigger than Jupiters. I have visited english wikipedia and found out that it is true - and that the difference is about 23°.  Why is it so?  I am not a physicist. I do not even study astrophysics, but I wonder why the difference is so big. I came to another conclusion that the rotation speed may play a huge role here. The faster an object is spinning, the smaller axial tilt. And according to wikipedia, there is a difference and it seems that it fits in my theory.  So. I did my research, but now I am not sure if that´s all and if it´s right. I mean, maybe there is another factor that I forgot to count-in. I know that, according to scientists, Jupiter formed before Saturn. Does it mean that the difference in formation answer my question to why the axial tilt &amp; the rotation speed vary so much? Or is it because of the distance to Sun? "
1907,"Within a given image of a multiple-image producing gravitational lens, does Fermat's principle apply?","The question Does gravitational lensing provide time evolution information? is excellent!     When we see multiple images of the same object because of the phenomenon of gravitational lensing, do all the images show the lensed object at the same point in time?      Does it take the same amount of time for light from the lensed object to reach us no matter what image we look at or are we watching the lensed object at different points in time and if so, how big can the difference in time typically be?   The answer is generally no, different ""images"" are associated with substantially different time delays.  But the lens and mirror-based optical systems we used to see those phenomenon pretty much strictly obey Fermat's principle where every ray entering the telescope's aperture reaching given point on a detector takes the same amount of time through the telescope.  Of course gravitational lenses are not manufactured imaging systems, but usually wherever you see that an image is produced in nature, the thing producing that image will obey Fermat's principle.  Question: So at least within one given image of a multiple-impage producing gravitational lens, does Fermat's principle apply at least approximately? "
1908,Calculate Atmospheric Extinction Using Source Altitude Angle,"I am trying to code up the following article [website]The approximation given is to take the inverse sine of right ascension in radians, however whenever RA approaches pi, the number blows out to 8e15.

1910,Why do objects burn when they enter earth's atmosphere?,Why do all objects burn when they enter our atmosphere? is this because of our atmosphere composition? and does this happen on other planets as well? 
1911,Why not us interferometry to take a picture of Pluto?,"Interferometry is among the best ways (if not, the best way!) to have an image of a very distant object.  Recently a picture of the black hole at the center of M87 was released. It is the result of several data collected by the Event Horizon Telescope, a series of arrays all across our world, working as one like a giant Earth sized telescope. The picture is not really cutting edge and high definition however it is still very surprising and in a way detailed enough, considering the fact that M87 is 53.49 million light years away... and this is where I arrive to Pluto which is just around 6 to 7 billion kilometers from us.  If we used an interferometer, perhaps the same size as the EHT (or just a smaller one, the size of an entire continent), and point all the arrays at Pluto, then we should have a picture with a resolution that is at least higher as the Hubble Space Telescope, but likely not as high as the pictures from the New Horizons spacecraft which directly made a fly by of Pluto... right?  If so then why don't we use interferometry to take pictures of Pluto from Earth? "
1912,Kuiper belt planet formation,"There are a lot of objects of different sizes in the Kuiper belt. Are objects in the Kuiper belt stable?

1913,"What are the differences between matter, dark matter and antimatter?","I thought dark and anti matter were kinda the same, but after saw a video, they mention that dark matter is not antimatter but their explanation is a little fast so I got doubts.

1915,2017 Eclipse intersection with I-95,"I am excited to see the 2017 eclipse in South Carolina and would like to understand where exactly the eclipse-path intersects I-95, so that I can plan a day-trip.  I have approximated at roughly Santee,SC, but would really like to overlay and pinpoint the eclipse-path intersection with I-95 in Google maps (blue line in .kml file).  Unfortunately, the KML file does not show I-95   Hasn't someone already done this with the web version with Google maps? Is there a simple process to either embed I-95 in the Google Earth .kml or  Command Google Earth to overlay the blue eclipse path over the internet connected map data?   I was able to plot Santee, SC (on I-95) on the .kml file:    Any edits to sharpen or clarify questions are appreciated.  I pose this question to the astronomy community because I think that someone has already done this.  See you at the eclipse! "
1916,Discontinuity in space-time,What I understood about it till now is that space-time fabric is kind of broken there. Please tell me whether I am correct.   If it's true then does it mean that perception of time will stop there? I really can't get what broken space fabric is like. If it's a hole then how is matter supposed to be present inside that? Is a black hole a discontinuity?  
1917,What is the smallest diameter black hole that can be formed naturally?,"I was watching the video I Put a 1mm Size Black Hole Next to Earth and This Happened - Universe Sandbox 2 discussing what would happen if a 1 millimeter black hole is orbiting the earth, and I began questioning myself, is it really possible to naturally have such a small black hole?  What is the smallest size that a black hole can form naturally in real life? "
1918,Equations of motion for Earth and Moon,"One of the simplest versions of Newton's equations of motion for the Sun, Earth and Moon can be obtained by making the approximation that the three bodies are perfect spheres. In this approximation, the pair potential between body i and j is  [tex] where [tex] is the distance between the bodies: one can solve the equations numerically and get the orbits.   This simple model does not include multiple, additional factors, such as    the fact that the Earth is not perfectly spherical (equatorial bulge), Earth's tides, the influence of other celestial bodies,   and others.  Amongst all these factors, what is the dominant one as for predicting the orbit of the Earth? In other words, what is the leading factor that should be included in the simple model above in order make its predictions for the Earth's orbit closer to the observations?  "
1919,How do we know that other planetary systems aren't composed of antimatter?,"How do we know that other planetary systems aren't composed of antimatter? If they never touch matter, then they don't annihilate. All their observable physics (spectra) are the same as matter, right? "
1920,Why are there uneven bright areas in this photo of black hole?,"  In the recently released photo of a black hole shown above, which was created by using data from EHT, why is the lower region brighter than the one above? Is it because of the rotation of the accretion disk? Also what is the orientation of the accretion disk? Are we looking at it head on? "
1921,I saw something unusual in the sky,So I'm a beginner at astronomy and I was trying to look at the moon but while trying to aim at it I saw a ring-like object in the sky. Does anyone know what this would be? all I could see was a ring with nothing in the middle of it. Was this a special type of star? 
1922,Regarding the curvature of the Earth,"I have a doubt in Earth's curvature. This question may be dumb.  How much we need to travel on the Earth to feel the curvature of Earth? Hypothetical case: for example, we are building a vehicle. How much is the length of that vehicle to feel the curvature of the Earth?  A more question, what is about the speed of the Earth. Again a hypothetical case. If we are travelling in aeroplane from one country to other, whether we can take Earth's rotational speed (rotating around it's own axis), and aeroplane speeds as comparables and find the resultant speed? "
1923,Is this the best non-radio image of whatever's at the center of M87? How was it taken?,"The BBC News article First ever black hole image released shows the instantly-iconic radio image of the (almost certainly) supermassive black hole at the center of the M87 galaxy, just released by the Event Horizon Telescope collaboration, also shown below.  Though it calls it a ""first image"", the article also shows a similarly edible-looking† donut-shaped image taken earlier, presumably using a different technology. However the caption doesn't explain what that is.  †[website]Does anyone recognize the earlier image and/or know what imaging technology and wavelengths were used to construct it? Is it roughly the same scale? Are these comparable donut-hole images?

1924,Is it possible to have a part of space devoid of matter?,"I have recently read this article and I am finding it a little hard to believe that there would be a place that is without matter. So, if there is a galaxy at the other side of the void, we would be unable to detect it. I am still very much a rookie at this, so please correct me if I'm wrong.   So could this article be telling the truth?  If so, what is the science/reasoning behind this? What if say, a black hole were to appear in such a void, what would happen?  "
1925,Are quasars simply AGNs that are viewed from a particular angle?,"I found the picture below in an answer to the post ""Was the Milky Way ever a quasar"". The picture is published on a website belonging to ""NASA/IPAC Extragalactic Database"". In the answer that has 16 ""thumbs up"" it says:     A quasar is simply an active galactic nucleus (AGN) that is viewed   from a particular angle; see the picture below, in which quasars are   labeled ""QSO"". This is really a remarkable figure because historically   all of the names in the figure were thought to correspond to different   types of objects, when really they all refer to the same thing!     There is another answer to the question ""Difference between quasar and Active Galactic Nuclei?"" where someone states that a quasars:      main property is that it's galaxy axis points towards the earth and   this way we receive its light and radio signals. That's why they are   one of the most energetic AGN.   This answer has gotten six thumbs up. However, there is no reference to any source backing up that claim so it seems like private opinion.   Does the picture above represent the mainstream view among astronomers today or is it more like a private opinion of someone? According to Wikipedia, ten percent of all observed galaxies are classified as Seyfert galaxies. Would we perceive all of those as ""quasars"" if we happend to observe them from the right angle? (Maybe there is also a luminosity requirement) According to Wikipedia Markarian 231 is the closest quasar at a distance of 581 million light years. Also according to Wikipedia, the Circinus Galaxy is the closest Seyfert galaxy, only 13 million light years away. Would we perceive there to be many quasars closer than 581 million light years away, if we just happend to view the active galaxy from the right angle? Could someone please show me the scientific investigations proving that the galactical planes of galaxies perceived to host quasars always lies within a certain range of observational angles as viewed from the Earth? These kind of investigations should be available if the claim that whether or not an active galaxy is perceived to be a quasar is almost totally depending on observation angle has a real backing and is not just speculation.  "
1926,Do the actual false colours in the M87 black hole picture convey information?,"As for the title. The picture could have been plotted in grey scale, B&amp;W, whatever couple of colours, or perhaps using a window of wavelength in order to show shift of the Doppler/relativistic Doppler kind.  Discarding the obvious dark, shall the picture be watch at merely in term of brightness, or considering yellow and red as well?   And independently, why those colours have been choose?  Just an aesthetic and suggestive choice, or that should be the apparent image as seen by eyes if we could go there?   I resume: is the picture a radio waves intensity or brightness map, or conversely a kind of ""as it would be"" picture in the Vis (modelled from the behaviour of the collected radio waves and theories)? "
1927,Kepler's second law of motion,"Planets sweeps out equal areas in equal times.   Is the area being calculated here the area of a triangle? You draw a straight line from the center of the sun to the earth at point A. The Earth moves to Point B and you have another straight line from point A to point B and the finally another straight line from point B to the Sun? Even though the Earth makes an arc, I guess we make it a straight line.  I guess my question is whether I have understood the second law correctly? That the area of a triangle was being calculated in an elliptical orbit, no matter how elliptical the orbit is.  "
1928,"If blackholes are spherical, what is the prespective of the blackhole image?","  If black holes are spherical, so shouldn't it be absorbing light from all the directions? How would one explain the light ring. which seems more like a 2D ring than a sphere? "
1929,Location on (or in) the celestial sphere,"First off, I apologize if I am breaking any site-etiquitte. Secondly, this is probably extremely elementary.   For a lab, I was given the question:     When we are sitting in a planetarium, where are we located on(or in)   the ""celestial sphere""?   To me, this seems like a silly question - because the answer is really dependent on where the operator places you. Is this assumption wrong? Is there a particular place in the celestial sphere that you would be?  I also thought that it might just be the very center of the celestial sphere. "
1930,Why doesn't the earth's surface collapse onto itself?,"From what I know the sun (or any other star) nuclear fission keeps it from collapsing under its own gravity until the fuel runs out, if that's so why doesn't the earth surface like the tectonic plates collapse to the earth's core? is it because of similar processes that happen in the earth's outer core (nuclear fission)? and if so what would happen if they would once stop? "
1931,How do I see the milky way?,"I've travelled to farms at night, and away from civilation. I don't really know alot about astronomy, but my goal is to see something like this:   Stars, lots of them, but that ""thick purple cluster of gas right in the center"". I want to see that.  I assume that on a very very dark day, we would be able to see this, but sometimes I only see stars, just lots and lots of stars, something like this:   I want to see this ""thick cloud cluster, which I assume is the milky way"". How do I see this? How on some days do I only see just stars and stars, when I really want to see this main beauty? "
1932,What does a solar eclipse at 99% totality look like?,"People smarter than me say the sun will be 99% covered during the 2017 solar eclipse where I live (Portland, OR metro). I am curious to know what it might look like (photo or drawing). Does this photo approximate 99% coverage? Or will there be slightly more sun? Will I still see some of the corona?   "
1933,Does Earth illuminate the unlit part of the Moon as,"... today is August the 17th? I just saw the moon (4:30 CEST) and I have the strong impression that the unlit (by the Sun) part of the Moon is anyway ""visible"" as a very very dark grey portion.  It will be impossible to find it against the dark sky if not for the companion bright slice. What I see basically fills the round, just is smaller as compared to the bright part.  This latter effect it is explainable by the fact that bright lights appear to us bigger as compared to less luminous objects when put in direct comparison. This is matter of perception. As such my question is: I am also just perceiving the rest of the moon because I know is there or indeed I see something real?   To me, it is reasonable that Earth can illuminate the Moon, however I am not sure. Moreover, the ""Earth phase"" as seen by the Moon should be crucial here. If I am right, this might explain why sometimes I see the above phenomenon but more often I don't. "
1934,Why aren't planetary bodies static?,"Why are planets moving in the first place? Gravity causes them to orbit, but why move at all?   note: this is not a question on why planets orbit each other, I know the reason for that is gravity. What I'm asking is why do planets move at all? For example, if you turned off gravity, why would the planets carry on moving apart rather than be stationary?  "
1935,"Generate East and North unit vectors tangent to a point on the celestial sphere, using vectors?","I am stuck and a little embarrassed.   I'm trying to implement this answer. I have a unit vector [tex] pointing in the direction of a radio source on the celestial sphere.  [tex] and [tex] are the two other, mutually orthogonal unit vectors that point east and north from that point, tangent to the sphere.  Without back-converting to R.A. and Dec or using trigonometry, is there a simple way to generate [tex] and [tex] vectorially?  Slide 38 here may or may not be helpful, I think my description is sufficient by itself. "
1936,Are many exoplanets synchronously tidally locked like Mercury?,"The only tidally locked planet in the Solar system is Mercury. But it is synchronously tidally locked 3:2, because of the relatively high eccentricity of its orbit, so doesn't turn the same side towards the Sun. I wonder if this is common for exoplanets?  Many discovered exoplanets are close to their star and must be tidally locked. Has any of them been determined to be synchronously tidally locked, like Mercury? Is Mercury a rare freak in this respect, or a representant of a common phenomenon? "
1937,"Will I be able to see the ""Beads of Baily"" at 99%+ totality?","Where I am (Vancouver, WA), the Sun will be 99%+ covered. Will I be able to see the ""Beads of Baily"" when the sun is 99%+ covered in my area ?  Downtown Portland, OR is expected to be 99.4% (according to local news). I expect Vancouver, WA, a suburb just north of downtown Portland, to be over 99% as well (99.3-99.2%??) "
1938,Was the use of silver on 'optical' telescope mirrors more common in the past? Why?,"In the past, weren't many astronomical telescope mirrors periodically removed and 'resilvered', and wasn't this actually done using silver?  I'm guessing that this is much less common now - new telescopes are so large and complex that routine invasive procedures like that needed for maintenance of a silver coating would not be acceptable, and mirrors in many if not most older telescopes would have been 'updated' to aluminum.  Was silver used in the past because aluminum coating was too technically difficult, or because silver has slightly better reflectivity in the red, or some other reason?  note: I'm only asking about 'optical' telescopes meaning NIR &amp; Vis, not the longer wavelength IR telescopes where IR emissivity is a concern. "
1939,Spherical Accretion (Bondi Model),"I have a question. I studied Bondi's model for spherical accretion. I know the assumptions made in the model are big and that they are rarely representative of what happens in astrophysics. What I wanted to ask is: is there a situation that suits this model even approximately, or it is a total idealization? Is there always an accretion disk, or may there be a situation where the accretion is spherical? "
1940,Might someone see changes to the corona during a solar eclipse?,"I've seen many pictures of the corona during a solar eclipse, and the structure and delicacy is amazing. Clearly, the appearance would change over time, depending on the fine details of the solar wind and the structure of the mass shed from the solar surface. I wonder, though: might the appearance, to the unaided eye, change during a single eclipse?  This could actually be treated as two questions (all example durations and times taken from the August 2017 eclipse):  a) Might the corona's appearance visibly change during totality at a single location (a maximum of 2 minutes 40 seconds)?  b) Might the corona's appearance visibly change between the first Earth-wide totality (16:48 UTC, when the Moon's shadow touches down in the Pacific) and the last Earth-wide totality (20:02 UTC, when the Moon's shadow last leaves the Atlantic)?  Searching for solar wind velocities yields a broad range of values, but [tex] seems to be a common value. With the solar diameter being about [tex], that's about a solar diameter per hour, which suggests there will be no visible change at a single location, but there certainly could be changes when viewed across the entire 3+ hours of totality.  So, can we expect changes in the coronal appearance during this eclipse, either at a single location or across the entire eclipse path? "
1941,Event Horizon Telescope Data Cleanup,"I was wondering how the researchers were able to minimize or neutralize confirmation bias regarding the data collected?  As I understand it, the algorithm pruned much of the data, which would make sense, since it would likely be useless noise. See for example the video Event Horizon Telescope Press Conference. First Image Of a Black Hole. at about 38:40.     Five petabytes is a lot of data… The image you saw of course isn’t 5 petabytes in size, it’s a few hundred kilobytes, so our data analysis has to collapse this five petabytes of data into an imaget that’s more than a billion times smaller.    But apart from that, could certain features be misidentified as artifacts, and be thrown out in favour of preselecting what researchers expected to see?  The only reason I ask is that the image looks almost identical to simulated predictions from two years ago - which may raise a slight cause for alarm.  Thank you.  To follow up (based on answers section below):  In the first stage process - ""common features"" - are they like existing stamps of astronomical features (and image comparatives) that have been already observed in our universe (in both the visible and invisible spectrum and used for comparison)? And a second question - if we have never observed the earmarks of a black-hole before, how are we to use existing stamps of knowledge of astronomical features that we have seen to assess and validate an as of yet unknown (which would seem to directly impact what artifacts are preserved and what artifacts are thrown out and discarded)? "
1942,When it was discovered that the classical planet are not stars?,"The classical planets (Mercury, Venus, the Sun, Mars, Jupiter and Saturn) were considered to be ""wandering stars"" - and the word ""planet"" means just that.  Wikipedia says ""By the 17th century, the idea of the stars being the same as the Sun was reaching a consensus among astronomers.""  Since the planets were considered stars in those times, the question is when did the astronomers realize that they are something else?  The same question in put in another words: When did the scientists first hypothesize that the planets do not emit their own light, like stars, and they just reflect the star from the sun? And when was that proven for the first time? "
1943,Why does the path of the moon in an eclipse curve (relative to the sun),"Reviewing several simulations of the solar eclipse, it is apparent that the path of the moon relative to the sun curves.   Using [website]Why is the path curved not straight? "
1944,"Do planets form around lone stars, multiple stars, or both? Do we know this yet?","Since about 1990 astronomers been able to detect planets around other stars, using a couple different techniques, which is amazing.  By this point, do we know whether planets form only around single systems, only around multiple systems, or both??  (Surprisingly you can't find this general issue explained in popular writing. I think it's ""obvious background knowledge"" to experts, hence just doesn't get outlined explicitly in popular writing.)  So, as of mid 2016:  (i) About how many exoplanets do we know of (say, with good certainty),  (ii) In fact, how many (if any) of these are around single-star systems?  (iii) How many (if any) are around multiple-star systems?  If indeed it is possible to have planets in multiple systems: is it just a planet going around one of the stars, or is ""all the way around both"" known? "
1945,Is the sun any brighter during a solar eclipse,"I keep hearing that you can go blind during a solar eclipse.   Is the sun actually any brighter during a solar eclipse? This is how the media seems to frame it, and they suggest you need special glasses to view the eclipse.  But after some reading, it seems that the warning is about just not staring at the sun in general, and there is nothing special about the eclipse.  Is this the case? "
1946,"If someone was above the galaxy, how much of it can he see?","If someone was far enough above the milky way to see the entire diameter, how much can he actually see with naked eye? I'm aware that on Earth, we only see stars within 1,000 light-years (roughly) by naked eyes. I found myself wondering if someone is more than 1,000 light years away from milky way then we won't be able to see it? "
1947,Why isn't the black hole white?,"I recently saw the first image of a black hole. As I understood, it is covered with bright, hot matter. In this case, how can we see the black disk (event horizon), instead of a bright disk due to the matter surrounding the black hole? Or is the matter around the black hole disposed in a disk shape and the astronomers got lucky that the disk was not oriented towards Earth? "
1948,What is the light source in the black hole images?,"What is the light source in the black hole images?  I've searched the site before asking, as well as tried to google it. But perhaps the answer is buried due to the recent news.  My understanding, is that the ring in the images is an illuminated accretion disc.  What I could not find explained is the light source, and by extension, why is a bright accretion disc – which is round by definition – a proof for light bending? (I'm not disputing the fact.) "
1949,Why does the darkening of the Moon go from left-to-right during an eclipse?,"In anticipation of the upcoming April 2014 lunar eclipse, I decided to use the 3D virtual planetarium software Stellarium to simulate what it is supposed look like where I live, since I've never actually witnessed an actual eclipse before. I set the clock to begin at the moonrise before the beginning of the event and to tick at a rate of a few virtual-minutes per real-second, pressed play, and waited for the eclipse to begin. When it did, I saw something I did not expect. To be honest, I realized my expectations were embarrassingly naïve.  I watched the Moon rise in the east and begin its upward left-to-right path across the night sky, towards its zenith in the south. My expectation was that the moment the Moon enters Earth's shadow which marks the beginning of the eclipse would be visually apparent by the darkening of the full moon's outer limb on the right side, and the darkening would progress from right to left from there. When I saw that the darkening actually progresses in the opposite direction, I immediately realized that my understanding of the geometry and kinematics of the Earth-Moon-Sun system must be much shallower than I would have thought.  My main question is must lunar eclipses happen this way every time, and if so why? My gut is now telling me that it does, so I'm mostly interested in an answer of reasonable depth to the 'why' part of the question.  Additionally, it occurs to me that the observation of left-to-right progression of darkening of the Moon's face during a lunar eclipse is especially counter-intuitive from the point of views of ancient geocentric cosmologies based on a stationary Earth that doesn't rotate. Can this observation be taken as empirical evidence that the Earth rotates? (I could be completely off base here. If so, please correct me.) "
1950,What is that void that the universe is growing into?,"We understand that this is the universe and it is essentially full of space and time, but what is on the outside of the universe, and isn't that nothing, something, and how far does that reach.  I.e. isn't that another aspect of the universe? For it to go into it, it must be something for it to go into it.  If I throw a ball through the air, the ball travels through air. If I throw a universe through the air so to speak, doesn't that have a characteristic, frame and limitation? "
1951,What must/do astronomers reveal beyond their academic papers?,"Academic papers often make claims about observational data and results from computations. The papers only refer to names of data sources (such as an observatory) and of mathematical methods without any specifics, other than some of it illustrated in a few graphs and tables. References lead almost only to other papers of similar format.  In order to replicate (or even peer review) a paper, obviously one must have access to specifics such as the actual calculations, the raw data, the software, the blue prints of the measurement equipment and logs of how it has been operated.  What data do peer reviewers and replicating scientists (and the public) have access to beyond a paper making some claims?  Two examples: The results of the infamous cold fusion press conference of 1990 could never be satisfactorly replicated. But were the attempts based only on the paper they then published, or did they publish on the side also a wealth of data about their procedures? And the more recent ""neutrinos travel faster than light"" media debacle was, as far as I know, all about the details of equipment, was all relevant information about it made public (for the science community)? "
1952,What would the sky have looked like when galaxies first started to form?,"If I stood on a theoretical earth at the time that galaxies were just starting to form, what would the sky have looked like?  Due to the smaller size of the universe would it have been densely packed with objects? If yes, what might I have seen? "
1953,"What is the extent of the ""worldwide campaign"" to observe near-earth object 2012 TC4?","This nifty answer describes and provides links to the data of the recovery of near earth object 2012 TC4, and the answer also shows the first actual image of the body for this pass. At apparent magnitude +27 (at about 52 million km) it may be the faintest asteroid to have been imaged to date. It's worth visiting that answer first before reading on here.  This comment points out that 2012 TC4 appears on the Goldstone Asteroid Schedule, a list of upcoming planned observations of asteroids by antennas at the Deep Space Network. Here are the entries for 2012 TC4 in the Upcoming Observations and Past Observations tables:  Upcoming Goldstone Observations DATES           TARGET    H     Notes: 2017 Oct  9-14  2012 TC4  26.7  Close approach = 7.9 Earth radii on Oct. 12. NHATS  Past Goldstone Observations DATES           TARGET          Notes: 2012 Oct        2012 TC4        Echoes not detected. Likely equipment issues.   I noticed at the top of the page there is a link to the The Arecibo asteroid radar schedule, and in the fifth line of the list shown in the screen shot below, I see that for 2012 TC4 there will be what is labeled there as a ""WORLDWIDE CAMPAIGN!"" of observations. The all-caps and exclamation point are a direct quote from Arecibo's table.  Question: What is the extent of the worldwide campaign to observe 2012 TC4? How many facilities? Is it coordinated? Perhaps simultaneous reception of reflected signals by multiple sites? Will it be coordinated with other observations such as infrared or optical wavelengths?  The plot below the Arecibo table is made from JPL Horizons data in the Earth-Moon barycenter frame. It shows +/- 24 hours from closest approach. The hyperbola (red) is the calculated trajectory of 2012 TC4 with dots every 2 hours and the short, (roughly) circular arc is the Moon, as descried in this question. The closest approach to Earth's center is projected to be about 51,000 km. These are preliminary calculations based on the first observation and may be refined a bit as the time of closest approach nears.         "
1954,Will Gaia detect inactive neutron stars?,"Will the astrometric precision of the Gaia space telescope be able to detect the gravitational influence of cold old solitary neutron stars on the movements of stars? At least in a statistical sense to estimate how common they are around here, which could say something about how large the population III stars were.  And if an inactive neutron star could be precisely located thanks to its gravitational influence, would it be possible to observe it directly? "
1955,Are we moving away or towards each other?,"There are numerous theories about the shape of the Universe. I've read somewhere most probably in 'A Brief History of Time' that there is a possibility that the Universe is spherical. So is it possible that all galaxies are moving towards each other? Imagine the Universe as a sphere. Now, imagine a diameter AB. The Big Bang took place at A and the galaxies started drifting away and as they moved away further they stared attracting each other on the other side i.e.Gravitational attraction. So we feel that the farther galaxies are the faster they are moving away(Hubble's Law) but actually they are moving towards each other and will eventually meet at point B. Also, space-time is spherical and so light travels along the sphere.  So, my question is: Is it possible for the universe to be spherical with galaxies apparently moving away but actually moving closer? "
1956,Sidereal time calculation,"I am creating program in C which is derived from Javascript Solar Radiation calculator based on a book Guide to HTML, JavaScript and PHP: For Scientists and Engineers By David R. Brooks. The original program calculates Sidereal time like this:    // Sidereal time (Theta0)   double GMST = 280.46061837+360.98564736629*( i-&gt;JulianDate-2451545.);   // Sidereal_time = GMST + 0.000387933*T2 - T3/38710000   double Sidereal_time = GMST+0.000387933*T*T        -T*T*T/38710000.;   // Performance optimalizatuion of code for Sidereal=fmod(Sidereal,360.) or Sidereal%360   double S_save=Sidereal_time/360.;   if (S_save &lt; 0.) Sidereal_time = Sidereal_time-ceil(S_save)*360.;   else Sidereal_time = Sidereal_time-floor(S_save)*360.;   if (Sidereal_time &lt; 0.) Sidereal_time+=360.;   Where i->JulianDate is date/time specified by user which is converted to Julian date. As you can see this approach is based on 2451545.0 which is the equivalent of January 1, 2000, at 12:00:00 UT and 36525.0 is Julian Year. I am not sure why there is 36525 instead 365.25 (days of Julian Year). Can you explain this?  Once more the same code without comments:    double GMST = 280.46061837+360.98564736629*( i-&gt;JulianDate-2451545.);   double Sidereal_time = GMST+0.000387933*T*T-T*T*T/38710000.;   double S_save=Sidereal_time/360.;   if (S_save &lt; 0.)       Sidereal_time = Sidereal_time-ceil(S_save)*360.;   else       Sidereal_time = Sidereal_time-floor(S_save)*360.;   if (Sidereal_time &lt; 0.)       Sidereal_time+=360.;   Another question:  If I enter date older than January 1, 2000, at 12:00:00 UT, e.g. 1945, will the sidereal time be correct? Or do I need to change the number 36525.0 to extend the range?  Yet, before the Sidereal time is calculated in the program there is this: double T=( i-&gt;JulianDate-2451545.0)/36525.0; Which is similar thing.  Sidereal_time is used to calculate hour_angle which is used to calculate Sun's elevation and Solar Zenit Angle Z. Will this variables be affected when I type 1945 or older date in the program?  EDIT: I have added log to my program which printed values into file. I have tested the program for range 1990-2010. You can see that the SideReal time same as L0 (Geometric mean longitude) is negative number when the date is older than 2000/01/01 as defined in the program to calculate T.

1957,What would happen when the earth consumed all its fuel?,"What would happen when a planet consumed all its fuel and its core extincts. Would anything change on the planet?  Can this ever happen before its star did so? If not, why? "
1958,How large does refraction become in radioastronomy?,"For atmospheric refraction of visible light, Wikipedia gives the order of 1 arc minute at 45° altitude above the horizon, and 5.3 arc minutes at 10°. This is caused by the dielectric polarizability of all of the bound electrons in all the atoms of the atmosphere.  At the much lower HF frequencies of radio, the free electrons and ions will contribute, and some forms of radio communication have relied on refraction at large incident angles to deflect terrestrial signals back to the Earth at a distant ground station.  So I expect that at the lower frequencies used in radio astronomy, corrections to the observed location of radio sources due to ionospheric refraction could be much larger than those at visible wavelengths, but I am not sure.  How large does can this effect ever get? At what frequency? Are there ever corrections as large as 1 degree?     I started thinking about this after asking How many stations could one hear with an AM/FM radio in front of the ISS' cupola window? which includes the image below.  below: from the Radio Jove Project's exercise The Effects of Earth's Upper Atmosphere on Radio Signals.   "
1959,"How would an exoplanet be found from earth if our view of its star system is ""from the top""?","When we find an exoplanet by observing the dimming of its parent star, this means that the planet passes in front of the star from our view.  What if our view of a star system is from its ""top"" or ""bottom""? Then from our view, none of its planets would pass in front of the star so we could observe a dimming. How would we know, then, whether such a star has or doesn't have planets? "
1960,"If Venus and Mars changed places, would we then have 3 habitable planets?","This is the supposition: Venus is too hot, Mars is too cold. If they switched places then Solar energy would change to make both more Earth like. We might as well have had three instead of just one ""Earth"" in the Solar system, if the roulette of early planet formation had played out just a little bit different.  That's of course too simple. But wouldn't it help alot if it were the case from the beginning that Venus had had Mars' mass, and Mars had had Venus' mass? Or do other factors dominate mass and distance from the Sun?  Would Venus still have had a thick, but not too thick, atmosphere if it were at 1.5 AU, because it has mass enough to keep one, and wouldn't that have kept it warmer than Mars is today? Including flowing water on its surface under its atmospheric pressure?  Would a Mars at 0.7 AU have been warmer and maybe have had a passing atmosphere created from melting volatiles during a longer era in its history? "
1961,"When did ""resilvering"" large telescope mirrors actually refer to aluminization, and why was it necessary?","This answer nicely summarizes the general picture of historical use of silver for mid to large size telescope mirrors, and the shift to aluminum once good quality vacuum pumps and chambers suitable for this process were available. A freshly evaporated, atomically clean aluminum surface will can sometimes violently react with oxygen, so this has to be done under high vacuum, and vented carefully with inert gas first.  When did the term ""resilvering"" generally start to actually refer to aluminum coating, and not silver? Was that actually the case by the 1960's or 1970's?   From what I remember, evaporated aluminum will form a protective oxide layer (""native oxide"") of the order of 10A thick within seconds or minutes that is self limiting - no further oxygen can penetrate this layer.   If this is so, why was re-silvering actually necessary? The cost, risk, and downtime associated with removing the primary and other mirrors every few years sounds like something you wouldn't do unless absolutely necessary. "
1962,How exactly does inflation convert random gravity fluctuations into coherent gravitational waves?,"In the course of this very enjoyable press announcement, it is mentioned that inflation can create gravity waves by amplifying gravity fluctuations.  I do not properly understand this statement. I always thought that quantum fluctuations (fluctuation of the metric in this case?) should occur pretty randomly whereas waves are rather coherent motions.  So I understand somehow that inflation can amplify quantum fluctuations, but I don't see how it can convert these random ""microscopic"" processes into ""macroscopically"" observable coherent phenomena called gravitational waves. For example, how are the sources of these gravitational waves distributed? Does each point in space-time behave as some kind of a point source? And what is observed at a specific point as the superposition of all these excitations?  In addition, in the same video it is said that not all inflation models produce gravitational waves, the ones that have them are favoured by the data now, etc. "
1963,Could evaporating hot Jupiters have metallic hydrogen on their surfaces?,"Jupiter is believed to have metallic hydrogen in its core. And gas giants that migrate to become hot Jupiters are believed to evaporate, have their atmospheres blown away by their nearby star. Can metallic hydrogen (or some other exotic materia) be detected on the surface of such a planet, or does it require high pressure to exist? What happens to the metallic hydrogen? Does it release much energy if and when it is transformed? "
1964,Is light bending around my finger?,"I was hoping that astronomy enthusiasts/scientists would help me out with a simple question about light. Hold your outstretched hand up to any bright light source (the sun, or even a light bulb) so that the light is completely blocked by at least one finger, and then slowly move your finger to the side until the light just peeks around. There seems to be a glow when you do this, and I was wondering what causes this.  Is the light bending around my finger from some sort of diffraction? What's going on? "
1965,Do constellations change?,"Many stars are part of constellations. Due to dark matter the stars have velocities which are nearly the same unregardless their radius of orbit around the centre of the Milky Way. Also, it takes about 200 million years to orbit this centre. But nevertheless the angle from which we look at those stars could change a bit during this orbit. Regarding all these effects, could you say that constellations don't change at all or does it just take a long while?  And of course stars could run out of energy and explode and vanish, so that we don't see them anymore. But is this the only way the constellations could change? "
1966,Retrofitting a DSLR camera to a super-cheap Tasco reflector telescope,"I was given a 1995 vintage Tasco ""302003"" Newtonian telescope recently and have had some exciting success with it.  I have managed to view the Moon in beautiful detail and also had my first glimpse of Jupiter (with Enceladus Ganymede &amp; Europa in the same shot!).  I was able (with very considerable difficulty) to photograph both Moon and Jupiter scenes by holding my camera up to the eyepiece.  Far from ideal but it has really fired my imagination about doing more astronomical photography.  Here's a picture of my telescope and it's accessories.  Despite spending the last 15 years in the back room of a charity shop, it's in brand new condition and all the parts are present including the tripod and all fixings!...   (Blue arrows indicate places where eyepiece lenses can be inserted).  My camera is a Nikon D40 (APS-C format, DX lens ring system).  Is it possible to modify this telescope's eyepiece (a rack-and-pinion tube-length adjustable type) so that I can attach my camera in order to take photographs of astronomical subjects?  Photographs of the Moon would be my primary goal.  I am happy to make severe modifications to the telescope if necessary.  But I realise that certain measurements would be absolutely critical to making good photographs possible.  I think I can make an adaptor that goes between the eyepiece socket and the camera.  But I don't know all of the parameters I will have to know to design such an adaptor.  Problems I believe I need to solve...   I think that holding the camera's central axis perfectly concentric with the eyepiece's axis is critical. I need some sort of Relay Lens between the secondary mirror and the camera body. Keeping the rack-and-pinion tube adjustment (actually a fairly sturdy mechanism) is important and would allow better focusing of the picture as the camera is not likely to have enough auto-focus range to cope with the 700mm F length.   I do have a small Milling machine and most of the basic machine tools.  I have a ready supply of aluminium stock and industrial plastic stock (RG1000) that I can build an adaptor from.  Is this project feasible?  I'm not looking for perfect photos, but rather something that is better and more convenient than holding my cellphone camera close to the eyepiece and holding my breath! :)  My astronomy/optics knowledge is practically zero but I'm a fairly savvy mechanical engineer and can build things to a specification.  Thank you for reading, I look forward to your responses. "
1967,Extraction of error spectrum in Sloan Digital Sky Survey,"I need to know does SDSS spectrum contains error spectrum as well?  [website]The above link says, further HDU's contain error spectrum and than tells about the inverse variance. Does inverse variance contains error spectrum? If yes, how can I extract that, if not where can I find error spectrum? "
1968,Orbiting and landing on non-sperical objects,"If we orbit a non-spherical asteroid or moon at a sufficient distance I believe that we can consider it to be a point mass. Therefore we can take up a conventional orbit.  Assuming our lander craft is of insignificant mass compared with the body we wish to orbit and land on, how do we cope when we get near to the surface?  Presumably an orbit will become more and more chaotic the nearer we get. As we try to land, unless we somehow synchronise with the body's rotation things will be equally tricky.  What implications did this have for Rosetta's Philae and what implications will it have for much larger and maybe more irregular bodies?  Is there some rule-of-thumb method to get an approximate answer or do spacecraft simply have to make minute by minute adjustments?  Note  I understand mathematics to a reasonable level but really I'm more interested in the practicalities of such landings. To what extent can they be pre-calculated and to what extent must they be adjusted on the fly. "
1969,Does the holographic principle contradict eternal inflation?,"As it is for example explained here, Andrei Linde's chaotic inflation is among the potential winners or survivors of the spring cleaning induced by the potential detection of primoridal gravitational waves. As this type of inflation is eternal, the new data might also lend some updraft to the multiverse business etc ...  But I always thought that because of the holographic principle, which means when applied to the exponentially expanding universe that stuff moving away can be thought of as being attracted to the cosmic horizon which takes to role of a black hole horizon, it does not make sense to talk about regions or any other universes beyond the cosmic horizon anyway.  So, does the holographic principle contradict eternal inflation as it arises for example from Linde's chaotic inflation? What does the detaction of primordial gravitational waves then mean when taking the holographic principle into account? "
1970,What happens to the shrinking universe in the presence of the pressure of Hawking radiation?,"Black holes release Hawking radiation. Now assume that the universe after all collapses back again, bringing all matter to a single black hole. I assume that this would bend the whole space-time of the universe as well, wrapping it around the black hole.  Now what happens to the shrinking universe in the presence of the pressure of Hawking radiation?  Could there be a stable point where pressure and gravity are balanced? "
1971,Rule of Exception in All Nearest Objects,"I once heard of a strange phenomenon, but now cannot find anything about it on the Internet.  I might be looking for the wrong keywords or misremember some relevant aspect.  So maybe someone here can help me out and point me in the right direction.  The described phenomenon goes like this, as I remember it:  During the course of the scientific research, people found out more and more about the objects surrounding us.  Moon, Sun, planets, other stars, other galaxies, etc.  But each time (more or less) a little later (after a new discovery was getting an established fact) it showed that the closest object of this kind to Earth was rather an exception among its peers.  For instance, the closest other galaxy is blue-shifted.  Or that the closest Pulsar is somehow an exception among its peers.  It might be that the rule was not about the closest but about the first found object of a kind.  I think I remember Prof Harald Lesch (a German physicist lecturing on TV in a popular format called ""Alpha Centauri"") mentioning this peculiar phenomenon and fleshing it out with some examples, but now I'm not able to find the clip.  I understand the point about closing this question, but maybe leave it open for some weeks (or months), just in case somebody drops by who has something to contribute.  After a grace period the non-reaction can be counted as a vote for ""isn't common knowledge"".  Without such a grace period closing the question can only be based on ""I don't know such a thing"" (which should not be enough).  The concrete questions (because that was asked for, so it seemed to be unclear to some people) are:   Is such a phenomenon known? Is there a source describing it?   Nice to have:  Which of the Alpha Centauri lectures was probably the one introducing me to the topic?  Is there a name to it? What are examples of such objects?  "
1972,"What is the connection between moons, rings, and gaps?",I was watching this video and they said that the rock probably has a moon. Is the reason they assume it has a moon is because there is a gap between the rings created by the moon's orbit around the rock? Or the rings created by the moon breaking down in its orbit and leaving debris behind in its orbit?   
1973,Build a high quality telescope from scratch,I am interested in building a high quality portable telescope from scratch in an attempt to better understand how telescopes work. What kind of materials do I need? How would I go about putting the telescope together? Are there any online guides that you can recommend? 
1974,Does the sky darken proportionally during a partial solar eclipse?,"During a solar eclipse, some of the visible area of the sun is obscured by the moon.  The exact percentage varies with time and with the observer's location.  My question is, does the sky darken by this same percentage?  In other words, suppose the sun is 80% covered.  Does sky light diminish by 80%?  Are objects illuminated by 20% of their normal amount? "
1975,What’s the object between the Earth and The Sun currently showing in Google maps?,"If I select satellite imagery in Google maps and zoom out, the Earth is shown in space. It shows light/dark regions correctly updated, but there’s an object between the Earth and the sun. It looks too small to be The Moon.    Is it real? What is it? "
1976,"Black Hole, Object or Portal?","Some say that a black hole is a rip in space-time, a portal linking two points in the universe as one. How sound is this? I've read that when a giant star collapses, what is left behind (a massive neutron star?) is so dense that light cannot even escape its gravitational pull. Is this phenomenon caused by an actual object? If one were to travel into a black hole, should not one find only really dense matter? "
1977,Why is every year the same number of days despite the gravity in the solar system?,"I was just watching a Geoff Marcy talk on YouTube showing how they infer the presence of planets transiting distant stars. The supposed periodicity wasn't always quite regular from what I could see, and so I wondered if there might be something tugging at the planets as they orbit their star. Then I thought of the earth: Surely there are some years when we are aligned with Jupiter so much so that it would exert some sort of perceptible influence on the planet, thus lengthening the year, even if only by some hours or days, considering that the sun is much more massive. And what would happen every few thousand (?) million (?) years when all the planets and even some of the larger asteroids, Kuiper Belt Objects - everything but the kitchen sink - come into alignment? Wouldn't the earth be drawn outwards to some extent, thus making a year perhaps 370 days long (or whatever)? And maybe temperatures would drop with the planet a fraction of an AU farther from the sun? I know that this is a website for the already enlightened, but I would appreciate an answer that even Josephine Bloggs would understand. "
1978,Can a black hole reach a limit where it can no longer attract more matter?,"Can a black hole reach a limit where it can no longer attract more matter? If so, what happens with that black hole? Does the black hole die? Does the black hole decrease its size? "
1979,What is the maximum number of planets in the habitable zone?,"At present, it seems like we are alone in our solar system. How many earth-like planets would fit into the habitable zone of the solar system?   The orbits should be stable for quite a time, i.e. for life to evolve, let's say 4.6 billion years. The habitable zone may be estimated from 0.725 to 3.0 astronomical units, according to Wiki.  Could one use perturbation theory to answer this? "
1980,"What was the ""brilliant new star in Aquila"" on June 8, 1918, just after the solar eclipse?","This great answer about the US Naval Observatory's $3,500 expedition to Baker City Oregon to observe the June 8, 1918 total solar eclipse links to the January 1919 Popular Astronomy article about the expedition. The article notes on page 6 the following coincidental observation:     An interesting occurrence was the appearance of the brilliant new star in Aquila. This was seen by Mr. Peters and Mr. Conrad on the night of June 8 and the discovery was communicated by telegram to various observatories in the country. It had however been discovered earlier on the same night by other astronomers in the east.   What is the story behind this bright new star in Aquila? What was it? Who discovered it first? "
1981,Do primary mirrors in large observatories undergo regular removal and re-coating of the aluminum? Why?,"Performance of astronomical mirrors that are exposed to the environment for long periods of time can experience a slow degradation of performance. They usually need to receive some kind of regular maintenance, which may involve cleaning and/or re-coating.   While I'm told that the aluminum degrades and must be replaced from time to time, this is not consistent with my understanding of the behavior of aluminum in air. I'm pretty sure that a freshly evaporated layer of pure aluminum will quickly develop a native oxide layer of perhaps 20Å of aluminum oxide as amorphous [tex] (alumina) which is then pretty much impermeable to diffusion of anything else the atmosphere might expose it to, including various pollutants.  I can understand that it might in some cases ultimately be simpler to strip and replace the aluminum after a number of cleanings due to accumulated damage from the cleaning, but is there any evidence that the aluminum must be replaced due to chemical degradation of the aluminum itself?  I found this article, Reflectivity Degradation Rates of Aluminum Coatings at the CFHT, Magrath, B. 1997, Pub. Ast. Soc. Pac. 109, 303 that seems to show that - at least at one observatory location - a representative test mirror exposed to the observing environment (in the dome) that was washed once a month showed no significant degradation in reflectivity over 32 months, similarly to a mirror that remained protected but not cleaned.  However, the test mirror that was exposed and not washed showed a continuous loss in reflectivity, dropping by about 10% over the same period. A fourth test mirror undergoing regular [tex] cleaning lost about 5% reflectivity.  This is a small, limited test of course, less than three years, only one location, one wavelength, and only one parameter (reflectivity). But it gives a bit of support to the idea that while mirrors get dirty and require regular cleaning, the aluminum itself may not actually deteriorate.  So I'm asking: Do primary mirrors in large observatories undergo regular removal and re-coating of the aluminum? Why?, where ""why"" addresses the specific need for the removal and replacement. If these primaries actually do receive regular re-coatings of aluminum, is it because the aluminum actually degrades?  I'm looking for an answer that carries some backup references. If just for example, your answer is of the form You silly goose, everybody knows aluminum tarnishes like the Dickens!, please back it up with a reference to measurements of aluminum tarnishing.

1989,Layout of the universe,"I've been working on a space game in my spare time, and lately I've been thinking on how to lay out the universe. Though I've searched around and found it hard to get a good view of what the universe looks like. I did find a lot of good sources, though I'm a very visual learner and found it hard to get a good picture of the universe with what I found. I also don't know what the good, reliable, accurate and up-to-date sources were.  So, are there any good visual sources to get a picture of the universe? Preferably a TV-series or a very well illustrated book, or perhaps even computer program.  Edit: I'm looking for a more general view of the universe. Like what do galaxies look like, and what is their scale. As I understand they contain a combination of planets, solar systems, star clusters, ... Though I couldn't get a good picture of how dense they are. Is there a lot of space (relatively) between these solar systems and star-clusters. I found that our solar system is about 4 light-hours big, though are the neighbouring ones average light years or thousands of light-years away? And in the space between them, is it mostly empty or is there space dust? The same question for whatever our galaxy circles around (if it does) and what is between different galaxies. (And perhaps what else is there of galaxy-size out there?)  I got a vague view of all of this from reading texts, though I feel like I'm missing a whole lot.  Edit 2: I'm not looking for properties of different planets, that's on a too small scale. In the game I'm planning on making a fictional universe (perhaps randomly generated, though not yet decided), but I want the broad layout to be realistic.  Edit 3: I just found this: [website]Thanks a lot! "
1990,Icy moons: why hasn't the ice sublimated away?,"Let's take Europa for example: The predominant model suggests that heat from tidal flexing causes the ocean to remain liquid and drives ice movement similar to plate tectonics.  The heat generated from the tidal flexing has to go somewhere. Is it all carried away by the water vapor plumes we recently detected? Is more water from the ice cover melting away? Is it just radiated away?  I would expect it to cause sublimation as well: There is hardly an atmosphere (molecular oxygen at 0.1 micro Pascals, or 10-12 times that of the Earth), and a tenuous ionosphere. And that same article suggest that the surface ice is also broken down by radiation:     the oxygen [...] is formed through the process of radiolysis, where ultraviolet radiation from the Jovian magnetosphere collides with the icy surface, splitting water into oxygen and hydrogen. The same radiation also creates collisional ejections of these products from the surface, and the balance of these two processes forms an atmosphere.      The hydrogen, meanwhile, lack the mass needed to be retained as part of the atmosphere and most is lost to space. This escaped hydrogen, along with portions of atomic and molecular oxygen that are ejected, forms a gas torus in the vicinity of Europa's orbit around Jupiter.   Or do we have reason to believe that any losses are compensated by ice being deposited from external sources? "
1991,Is there some upper limit in the moon size distribution?,"The planets range hugely in sizes, Jupiter is more than 300 times as massive as Earth. But the sizes of the large moons seem to be uncorrelated with the sizes of the planets they orbit. Why doesn't Jupiter have a giant moon with a mass hundreds times larger than the Earth's Moon's?  Among gas giants, Saturn at a third of Jupiter's mass has the largest of all moons and Triton way out at 30 AU Neptune is the 7th largest of all moons. The theories of the origin of the moons seem to vary much too, without explaining any upper size limit. The Moon was formed by an impact. Triton and maybe Titan were captured. Other large moons were formed along with their planet. Is this upper size limit on moons imaginary, coincidental or is there some reason for it to be this way? I of course mean a hypothetical expected upper size limit for exomoons in general, not only statistics about the Solar System moons.  The wonderful illustration here is from Emily Lakdawalla at The Planetary Society, it is now my desktop background.   "

This question appeared because there are some very ""sparse"" galaxies (very few stars in them) and scientists say night sky in them is practically all black (starless)...

1996,Fact Check: How bright will the Perseids be in 2017?,"A friend sent me an email which appears to be an extract from this Cambridge News article:     A meteor shower astronomers have labelled 'a once in a lifetime opportunity' will take over the sky in August. The upcoming Perseid meteor shower will be the brightest in human history so far, Physics Astronomy reported.      Anyone in the Northern Hemisphere should be able to view the shower on August 12. It is predicted to be so bright that stargazers should be able to catch a glimpse even during the day.      Astronomers believe that a shower this visible won't grace the sky for another 96 years. The Perseid meteor shower, one of the brighter light shows of the year, occurs annually between July 17 and August 24. The shower tends to peak around August 9-13.   However, this article sources its information from the website Physics Astronomy, a blog-type website which posts various articles on astronomical topics. Since Physics Astronomy doesn't seem to be a particularly reputable source, I will take this information with a pinch of salt.  So, is this article true? Will you be able to see the Perseids in the daytime with the naked eye this year? "

1999,Can aliens possibly be around us?,"I've heard somewhere that when we observe distant galaxies, we actually look into the past. For example, if a planet is 3 million light years away from us, it means that we observe its state as it was 3 million years ago, am I right?  So, I think this explains why we haven't encountered any aliens yet. Because we see their planets in their ancient times, their civilizations haven't formed yet. So we think that nobody's around us. But instead we can actually be surrounded by alien civilizations.  Is this idea plausible? "

2001,What is the actual resolution of Event Horizon Telescope?,"I am quite impressed with the recently published image of M87* black hole. It appears that this image achieves spatial resolution well above and beyond what was available until today. But how high this resolution is, exactly?  The article ""First M87 Event Horizon Telescope Results. I. The Shadow of the Supermassive Black Hole"" states that Event Horizon Telescope has theoretical diffraction-limit resolution of ~25 μas.  Another wiki article states that M87* has Swartzschild radius of 5.9×10-4 parsecs. Combined with the distance of 16.4 million parsecs, this gives me angular size of 14.8 microarceconds.  Even with the shadow of the black hole being 2.5 bigger that its radius, the resolution of a widely distributed picture seems to be much higher than 25 microarcseconds stated above. Is the image actually blown up well beyond its original resolution (i.e. becoming more a less an ""artistic impression""), or Event Horizon Telescope is actually capable of higher resolutions (10 microarcseconds or less)?

2003,"""How the Universe Works"": is it scientifically accurate?","The documentary/mini-series How the Universe Works is based on scientific evidence and according to what is known nowadays, or sheer bunk?  Throughout the series, are there any particular topics which are still disputed among the scientific community and that were portrayed in a different light than they should've had been?    I've only watched a few episodes but they always talk in a way that gives you the feeling everything is well-established and accepted but that might not be the case. I figured that an astronomer that watched the series would have remember if this happened or not.  I understand the subjects were researched and there is footage of known scientists in the episodes, but that doesn't mean everyone agrees with them. (By everyone I mean the most part of scientists working on those subjects, and not literally every single one of them.)  To give you an example, on the second episode they state that there are massive black holes at the center of galaxies. From my perspective (i.e. of someone which is not an astronomer) if they say so it's because it's probably true. However, in the real world maybe this is a highly disputed theory and a lot of astronomers disagree with this stance, and they're note telling the audience about it. Why would they do that? I don't know. I don't know if they did, I'm just asking if someone knows whether it happened, or if anyone saw something in the series with which they disagree. "
2004,Are those noise or stars?,"So there is this huge picture by Hubble.  Better yet, with the zoom tool  And if you zoom to the maximum level, you can see a seemingly uniformly distributed dots of orange and blue. Are those actually stars and maybe galaxies behind them and not just camera noise?  Furthermore I'm trying to get a grasp on how large portion of the sky this photo represents.     At 3.4, the apparent magnitude of the Andromeda Galaxy is one of the brightest of any Messier objects, making it visible to the naked eye on moonless nights even when viewed from areas with moderate light pollution. Although it appears more than six times as wide as the full Moon when photographed through a larger telescope, only the brighter central region is visible to the naked eye or when viewed using binoculars or a small telescope.   Let's say this is about the half of the diameter of the galaxy so this photo is about ~3 Moons wide, is that correct? "
2005,Did the Moon ever approximate a geosynchronous orbit above the early Earth?,"Simulations suggest the early Moon formed about 20,000 to 30,000 km away from Earth which is less than the current geosynchronous orbit of 42,164 km.  The Moon is now 384,000 km away from Earth.  Does that mean the moon approximated a geosynchronous orbit for a time on its journey outward to its current orbit?  I recognize because of the Earth's tilt of 6.7 degrees the Moon does not orbit around the Earth's equator and therefore a geostationary orbit wasn't possible.  If the early Earth was a water world covered almost entirely with water at the time it formed, what would happen when the Moon approached geosynchronous orbit and applied its much more amplified gravitational force upon the Earth?  Would there be tidal bulges of water at both ends exposing land at the polar regions or would the water eventually make its way toward the Moon side possibly exposing or making a bulge of land at the opposite end of the Earth? "
2006,How did the moon's orbit become eccentric?,"The Moon's orbit is more eccentric, 0.0549, than most planets. I can understand that planets get eccentric by disturbing each other like under the late heavy bombardment. And likewise for multiple moon systems. But shouldn't the debris after the collision with Theia have been circulirized? Is its orbit being changed by the planets, at every opposition with Venus? "

2008,How can I tell if my solar glasses are up to ISO standards?,"Like many, we bought solar glasses to view the eclipse, and are now in a strange place where we can't tell if they're safe or not.  The big fuss seems to be about ISO 12312-2 compliance.  Apparently there are some glasses which are claiming to be certified and putting the logo in the glasses when they are, in fact, not up to spec.  Now the only ""solution"" that has been given is to buy from one of the ""reputable"" vendors documented by the AAS.  Many smaller vendors are crying foul, saying the big guys are just trying to push out competition.  So my question is this: if I had a pair of glasses, what would be the proper way of determining if they met ISO 12312-2 standards?  Is there supposed to be a way for a customer to trace their purchase back and verify that the company that made them at least has their paperwork in order? (A company that has their paperwork and is still counterfeiting anyway is a different challenge).  Obviously the astronomy community is interested in ensuring their products are safe.  How were they supposed to do that in the ideal circumstances?  If I can't confirm their certification as a small-time buyer, how would a large-scale buyer of, say, 100,000 glasses or viewers determine that the product they are buying is genuine before someone burns their eyeballs?  Surely when there are hundreds of thousands of dollars on the line, there would be a process to demonstrate compliance.  EDIT: I am specifically looking for how one is supposed to verify these glasses without relying on a whitelist provided by a single group such as the AAS (other than perhaps the ISO community itself).  Surely there is a way to verify claims of ISO compliance without relying on the good intentions of a professional society.  Otherwise, what is the point of having certifications in the first place? "
2009,What types of star do we know are hostile to life (like ours)?,Certainly all stars have enough energy for a planet to host life.

2011,How big is nebula dust?,"Whenever I see the term dust for the particles of a nebula, I ask myself whether this is actually based on some reliable measure of particle size. Of course we can all agree it looks like dust from this distance. And we all know how such appearances often lead to assumptions which are incorrect and whose incorrectness we are often blind to.  Is there any reliable evidence by which this ""dust"" is known not to be pebbles, rocks, boulders etc.? Which in reality would seem vastly more likely.  How might we measure size from such distances? "
2012,attractors of Mercury's spin-orbit relation,"Mercury rotates at such a rate that the Sun appears to stand nearly still at perihelion, when the tide is strongest.  Is there a mechanism that tends to adjust the orbital eccentricity to improve the match – minimize the tidal torque (integrated over time), or some such?  If so, might there be other stable combinations of eccentricity and rotation coupling, other than the obvious 1:1?  EDIT: I'll rephrase, since most of you seem to think my question was something elementary like “how does Mercury rotate?” or “what the heck is tidal locking anyway?”.  I suppose it's not a bad heuristic to assume that the newcomer is completely ignorant, but I wish that assumption didn't override a literal reading of the question.  Each planet's orbital eccentricity varies over time.  Mercury's is now suspiciously near to what it would need to be for the sun to stand exactly still at perihelion.  So it's conceivable that in the dawn of time Mercury orbited at some arbitrary eccentricity and rotated at roughly 3/2, then resonance brought the rotation rate to exactly 3/2, and then something adjusted the eccentricity so that Mercury's long axis – the line of the lumps on which the tidal torque acts – tracks the sun more closely around perihelion.  (I wouldn't expect a perfect match at perihelion, because though tide is strongest then it doesn't vanish at other times!)  If that adjustment effect does happen, how does it work?  And if that happened for 3/2, could it also happen for other resonances, say 2/1 or 5/4?  For an odd denominator (other than 1) does the effect, whatever it is, behave differently (unless Mercury has a weird shape)? "
2013,Saturn's tropical year?,"What is the value of Saturn's ""tropical year"" (as opposed to its ""sidereal year"").  I am seeing it listed as 10 days shorter (10,747 days) than the sidereal year (10,759.22 days).  How could this be if the precession of the axis (equinox) is so slow (~1.86M years)? Is this an ""transient/osculating"" value? Frame of reference (e.g. J2000)? Am I completely missing something?  I think I can calculate the tropical year by (close to, this works for Earth):  [tex]   Using NASA planetary facts data on Saturn (these figures are re-used on many websites):  [tex] Using JPL Horizons data:  [tex]   about 0.170 days less.  Also, interestingly, see the instantaneous sidereal year of Saturn from the graph of JPL Horizon's data, using the sun's centre (blue) and solar system barycentre (red). I think the instantaneous tropical year (at epoch) would always be 0.170 days less.  I think this is where the confusion is: texts have used particular values, and further the same text has picked a sidereal from one epoch (or average), and a tropical from another...    Saturn's instantaneous length of sidereal year in days, at epoch. "
2014,Is there a significant temperature difference on the moon from apogee to perigee or vice-versa?,"Do those few thousand kilometers of difference going around the earth significantly affect the amount of thermal energy the moon receives from the sun to warm up its surface?

2017,"Do the ""schwarzschild metric"" or the ""isotropic metric"" fit the Event Horizon telescope data on Messier 87 better?","The ""Schwarzschild solution"" in ""Schwarzschild metric"" looks like:  [tex]  Using this metric you get certain values for the radius of the ""Schwarzschild radius"", the ""photon sphere"" and the ""least stable circular orbit"", among other things. When the Jet Propulsion Laboratory or other institutions are dealing with orbital dynamics in the solar system, they instead use the ""isotropic metric"" or at least a first order expansion of the isotropic metric to calculate relativistic effects on the orbits. Now the Schwarzschild solution in isotropic coordinates looks like:  [tex]  Now in isotropic coordinates the ""Schwarzschild radius"", the ""photon sphere"", the ""least stable circular orbit"" among other things take other values.   Question 1: Now that we have the measurements from the ""Event Horizon Telescope"" on the black hole, can something be said about what coordinates that fits the data better?  Question 2: It might be that both metrics fit the data equally well if we change the mass of the central black hole. Do we get different values on the mass of the central black hole if we fit the data using the isotropic coordinates instead of the Schwarzschild coordinates?    According to the Schwarzschild solution in Schwarzschild coordinates the photon sphere is located at an ""r-parameter"" of [tex]. According to this post when using the Schwarzschild solution in Schwarzschild coordinates the apparent radius ([tex]) of something residing in a spherically symmetric gravitational potential when viewed from infinity is: [tex] According to this formula we will observe the photon sphere at a radial distance of [tex]. Now I assume astronomers estimate the  ""observed radial distance"", ""[tex]"" from the center of the M87 black hole to the photon sphere around the M87 black hole by measuring the angular size of the observed ring together with some estimate of the distance from earth to M87. If you use the formula for the photon sphere radius in Schwarzschild coordinates together with the formula for gravitational lensing enlargement you end up with a formula for the central mass of M87 as: [tex].  Now if isotropic coordinates are used instead you will get another expression for the ""r-parameter"" of the photon sphere (I do not know what that expression looks like) and another expression for the ""gravitational lensing enlargement effect"" that makes objects in a spherically symmetric gravitational field look larger when observed from infinity.  What i specifically would like to know in the second question above is how much the mass of the central body will ""change"" if you keep [tex] constant but you use isotropic coordinates instead of Schwarzschild coordinates and in both cases equate the ""r-coordinate"" with radial distance.    I am a bit confused about the concept that you can do various coordinate transformations of the ""r-parameter"" in the Schwarzschild solution and still get a solution that fits reality. "

2021,What is the mass limit in a stellar accretion disc?,I became curious about the maximum mass in a star's accretion disc while watching an episode of Star Trek involving a Dyson Sphere. I wondered if some maximum amount of stellar material would limit natural and artificial structures around any system of one or more stars. What affects these limits? Is there a logarithmic/linear/exponential correlation between stellar mass and maximum accretion mass?  
2022,"If a black hole does not emit light, how can one take a picture of the black hole itself?","There's some discussion that the image composed by the Event Horizons Telescope is really just an accretion disk. To ""take an image"" of something, you need the light reflecting off of the surface of the object within frame. The ""light"" in the image is really just color-mapped gases within the accretion disc. Since black holes do not allow light to escape, is this actually an image of a black hole?  The analogy I've heard is that it would be like taking a picture of an object in a completely dark room, showing someone the photograph taken, and saying, ""Hey look at this picture I took of this object."" The other person could ask, ""Where is the object in this entirely black photo?"" to which the other person might respond, ""It's somewhere in the picture.""   Was a picture of the object really taken if you can't even see it? If you photograph the sky, have you ""captured an image of air molecules?""   "
2023,What are the problems that need to be taken in consideration when trying to find planetary position by using jpl ephemerides?,"I'm currently trying to determine the position of the sun and the moon from jpl ephemeris DE200 which is referred to the dynamical equator and equinox of 2000 and uses tdb time. I am using the j2000  system ECI.The things that trouble me are the following:  1.Is the moon position given with respect to Earth or with respect to the barycenter? Also when we find the sun position by using the earth-moon barycenter position and lunar coordinate , will the sun position be with respect to Earth?  2.If I'm using UTC time  , how exactly to obtain the TDB or TAi, since it's oscillating?( After that I want to obtain the JD for TDB)  3.If I'm using  J2000 ECI coordinate system , do I need to take in acount the effect of nutation and precession? And how to do that?  "
2024,Will stars live longer if they consume more hydrogen?,"I heard that stars would live longer if they consumed more hydrogen and material from their 'environment'. Is that true? For example, if the sun consumed all of the gas giants, would it live a little bit longer? "
2025,Do other G-type stars follow an 11-year cycle of activity?,"Our Sun follows an 11-year cycle of low-to-high activity. During high activity, there are much more sunspots and much higher chance of flares and other disruptive behavior.  Can we observe the activity of other stars? I'm particularly interested in other G-types like the Sun. Do they also follow an 11-year cycle? "
2026,Is it just the observable universe that is expanding?,"Is it possible that it is just our observable part of the universe that is expanding, in the time that we exist, and other parts are both expanding and contracting at different rates and times?  Would light from a shrinking or slower/faster-expanding part of the universe reach us?  Could that be an alternative to the big-bang theory, in that the red-shift is a temporary situation local to our time and part of the universe? A ""throbbing"" energy that leads to the non-uniformity that we see in galaxy clusters; something like foam awash on the ocean surface. "
2027,Which focus point does the sun occupy for each planet?,I am aware that planets orbit in an elliptical fashion and that the sun occupies one of two focal points.   Let us say that the left focal point is f1 and the right f2.  Is the sun at the same focal point for each planet?  If not which ones are different? 
2028,"Telescope in Sun's gravity lens focus - pointing, gain, distortions","A telescope located in the gravitational focus of the Sun can use the Sun as a magnifying lens. The focus begins 550 AU away, but maybe a 700 or 1000 AU distance is needed to get rid of disturbances from the Corona, and the focus extends practically indefinately. Here are some slides by Dr. Maccone who has promoted this idea he calls FOCAL: [website]I intend to ask about the technical design and feasibility of such a project in the Space Exploration SE. Here I rather ask about the scientific value and challenges.  POINTING: The magnification would occur only in the exact direction of the Sun. But since the Sun moves and the background objects magnified move, I suppose that the observed targets would change continuously. Would it even be practically possible to give the telescope a trajectory which keeps it aiming at for example Alpha Centauri? Would there most of the time be nothing in the right direction as the line between the telescope and the Sun sweeps across space, or would there alway be some star or galaxy in sight? Like CMB if nothing else.  GAIN: In the slides linked above, Maccone has calculated the expected gain to 114 dB for infrared wavelengths. How many times ""magnification"" does this mean? I don't think I understand the units here, I get a ridiculously large number. Can it be explained somewhat intuitively? Would a FOCAL mission be a unique revolution in astronomy, or could similar results be achieved by building an interferometer with interplanetary sized baselines here nearer to the Sun? How does the science value of a gravity lens compare to that of a wide baseline? Are they good for different tasks?  DISTORTIONS: Could the lensed signals be reconstructed thanks to our knowledge of the Sun and measurements of corona activity? If pointed towards a central part of the Milky Way, wouldn't signals come from multiple objects at the same time, some much further away than others? Would the gravity lens of the Sun have bigger problems with distortion than the intergalactic gravity lenses we know of today?  And finally, can any natural strong lensing inside the Milky Way be used today, for example using a globular cluster as a lens? "
2029,How to understand Kepler telescope under large aspherical wavefront,"To my understanding, a Kepler telescope is designed to conjugate one plane to another. For example scale down/up the incoming wavefront onto a wavefront sensor for measurement. It works well for small wavefronts, i.e. the wavefront is relatively flat (e.g. [tex] wavefront RMS).  What would happen if a large aspherical wavefront is impinging onto the same Kepler telescope system? Paper Calibration issues with Shack-Hartmann sensors for metrology applications suggests to place the aperture at the shared focal plane for performance improvement, as below:    How to understand the intuition behind? Why would Kepler telescope fail for large aspherical wavefronts? "
2030,Solar Telescope Projector Screen? [& intro telescope for solar eclipse],"I don't know very much about telescopes; I used one a few times as a kid, but that's about it. I understand the general design &amp; use of reflectors &amp; refractors, but I don't know enough to decipher focal length, etc. So, I don't feel comfortable trying to DIY my own contraption, that won't be nearly as good, assuming it works at all.  I'm looking to buy a minor telescope (a few hundred dollars [US] or less) to view the American Total Solar eclipse on Aug. 21, 2017; and possibly reuse for the Mercury transit in 2019. I'm a decently well off computer programmer, so blowing $200 (&amp; some gas to drive up-state) for a one off just to experience the Solar eclipse is worth it to me, even if I don't use it again.  I spent a few hours wandering around the internet for something, and I found a few styles of ""Projection Screens/Scopes"" that are really cool, but I can't find anywhere to buy them. The first is an image that several websites used as their article's banner image, but none say what it is or where to get it.    I found another one, where a guy hacked together a projector scope from an old 8mm film projector.    I've found many DIY tutorials to roll-your-own out of dixie cups &amp; Pringles cans, but as I said before: I'd rather not waste my time fumbling with that, since I'd probably screw it up; I'd rather pay money to get one that's good quality &amp; done right.  I've wanted to buy a big light bucket for years now, so I can start looking at nebulae &amp; planets, but never got around to it; mostly because I'm not sure what to buy. I've been looking at the ""Orion SkyQuest XX14i Dobsonian"" for a while, but never pulled the trigger. Given that the eclipse is only 3 weeks away, I figured something smaller would be a faster choice in the short term.  I found the ""Celestron EclipSmart 50 50mm f/7.2 Alt-Az Solar Telescope"" that comes with a backpack storage bag, for \[tex]100 for a telescope like that normal, or is that a poor quality trap for laymen like me?  Do yall have any advice on something to get for the solar eclipse? And is there anywhere to get a professionally made projector screen like that, so I can watch the multi-hour process from a chair rather than bending over for 2 hours? (p.s. I'm 6 foot 3 inches tall) Also, if possible, being able to record video of it on my Samsung Galaxy S6 would be cool, but not required if that's a big deal.  Thanks for your help,  -Yurelle "
2031,Might the universe be really small yet seem infinite from spherical reflections?,"if a single source of light quite small, was placed somewhere inside a completely reflective sphere, quite large, what would the reflections look like from the light source's point of view within that sphere?  :)  extra-credit: what would it look like over the course of time with movement starting from the moment the light turned on?  Found this question has been asked over in MathOverflow, sum clue? "
2032,What prevents consequent eclipses?,"I know there are a number of parameters that determine the occurrence of a solar or lunar eclipse. The number should be 18; 6 degrees of freedom for 3 rigid bodies. But can't figure out why eclipses are not repeated.  When we have a night with a full moon, the next night we again have a close-to-full moon, so it can be considered a distribution over several days. What prevents the same happening for eclipses? Is it possible to have two semi-eclipses in two consecutive days? If not, why does such a big difference occur over just a day?  Thanks, "
2033,Gravitational lensing in Newtonian physics,"Famously, when Eddington attempted to measure gravitational lensing during the Eclipse, it was the measured magnitude of the lensing that gave gravity [pun, obviously, intended] to General Relativity - not the measurement of lensing itself. That is, Newtonian physics also predicted a lensing deflection, but only half of the deflection predicted by GR.   Question is: Why? I've read a lot about this, and I can see how when one integrates the Newtonian acceleration along the photon path with constant |v|=c this gives the 'correct' Newtonian value - but intuitively, I can't wrap my head around it. Why should a massless photon be affected by gravity at all in Newtonian gravity? "
2034,Why do Jovian moons fade when transiting Jupiter's shadow?,"When reading an article on using Jovian moons to calculate longitude, I came across this passage:     Periodically, Jupiter eclipses each of the four large moons as they pass into the planet's mammoth shadow. In a telescope, a moon's brightness takes several minutes to fade to black as it enters the shadow. Reappearances are just as gradual.   How can the moons take this long to fade in and out? Is it simply the shadow creeping over the surface of the moons? What does this look like? "
2035,Elemental abundances in the crust of exoplanets and accessibility to them,"Suppose I am orbiting a rocky planet (density = 4.4 g/cm3) two-thirds the mass of Mars in the Habitable Zone of Gliese 251. This planet has a thin atmosphere, presumably from out-gassing, still has internal heating, has a weak magnetic field, but has no sign of tectonic activity. I need to mine precious and radioactive elements to replenish my ship. Gliese 251 only has about 8% of the metallicity of the sun. Can I assume that the planet (theoretically) would have about 8% of the elements (per volume of crustal material) as the Earth? Would lack of tectonic activity make them much harder to get to? "
2036,Meteors made of differing substances. Will they all burn up?,"If an object enters Earth's atmosphere, what determines whether it burns up or not?  Example  A feather is released from a space-ship 30,000 km away from Earth and falls under the influence of Earth's gravity.  Will it burn up on re-entry or will it float down to the surface unharmed. If it would be unharmed, where is the cutoff point for which objects survive? "
2037,What is the difference between Terrestrial Time (TT) and International Atomic Time (TAI)?,"The equation which relates Terrestrial [Dynamical] Time (TT, or TDT) and International Atomic Time (TAI) is the following, according to the U.S. Naval Observatory:  [tex]  As I have understood, both TT and TAI are continuous time systems (differently from UTC, which has leap-second gaps) and described by the same unit (the SI second), but counted from a different epoch (the origin T0 of one is 32.184 seconds after the other).  It appears that both time systems are essentially the same. So what is the actual difference between them? If the difference between them is the nature of how they are computed (e.g., TT is a theoretical timescale; and TAI is a statistical timescale based on several clocks), why the 32.184 shift? "
2038,Why don't planets and asteroids have (cometary) tails?,"Comets have tails. We all know that, and a lucky few have seen the better known. So why don't the planets (e.g. Earth, Mars) have tails? Why don't asteroids don't have tails? "
2039,Radial Density Profile Equation,"The Virgo Galaxy Cluster has a mass of [tex] and its centre is [tex] from Earth. The large elliptical galaxy [tex] lies at the centre of the Virgo cluster. [tex] has a supermassive black hole at it's centre with an estimated mass of [tex]. Take Hubble's constant to be [tex].   Taking the Virgo cluster to be spherically symmetric with a radial density profile given by   [tex],  Determine the value of the constant [tex] is S.I units assuming the radius of the Virgo cluster is 1Mpc.     I am confused with how to approach this question,  I know that density [tex], when I substitute it into the given radial density profile, the [tex] variable doesn't cancel, should I substitute the radius of the cluster into [tex]? Is it really that straight forward? "
2040,Does the Giant Impact Hypothesis explain how the Moon circularized its orbit?,"I just read most of Wikipedia's article on the Giant Impact Hypothesis. Basically a large object impacts Earth and creates debris that soon coalesces into the Moon.  But there is something I did not find mentioned: How would the Moon get its circular orbit?  A debris field from any impact would at first follow a very elliptical orbit, with a perigee very close to the surface of the Earth and an apogee much farther away. In orbital mechanics, where you start is where you end up. In fact it doesn't even have to be where you start. Pick any point in the orbit and you will return there again. In other words, the original elliptical orbit doesn't change its shape.  ...Unless there are pertubations or impacts that change your velocity. How exactly did that happen? Does the GIH just assume something else did that fortuitously?  I've also seen youtube video simulations like this. It's hard to tell if the camera angle is changing or if the orbital plane is unstable (how?), but you can clearly see the debris goes around and impacts the surface again and again. I.e., the orbit remains highly elliptical. I've never seen a simulation that shows the debris circularizing.  I also want to note that this question is highly relavent not just to the Moon, but many other things like orbital capture as well. I've never understood orbital capture theories as they all seem to leave out how the initial elliptical orbit later becomes circular, e.g., Triton. "
2041,What if our galaxy didn't have a SMBH?,"From my understanding, it is believed that almost every big galaxy and especially spiral galaxies have supermassive black holes (SMBH's) at the center. Also, from what I've read, a SMBH isn't required for a galaxy to exist since and in layman's terms, the matter inside a galaxy such it gas clouds and formation of stars will keep it gravitational-ly in check.   If I am right or even wrong, then would there be significant difference if our galaxy did not have a SMBH at the center? Significant enough for noticeable differences even here on Earth? "
2042,Which force makes planets to continuously revolve around their parent star?,"We know that planets revolve around their parent star (or specifically Barycenter), they maintain a specific speed of revolution so that they don't end up smashing into their planet star. Which force or energy do that, so that they maintain their speed? If we have infinite amount of time, would planets smash into their parent star ? "
2043,How many celestial bodies can I see with a 90x telescope?,"I am a 9th class student so I'm a beginner at using a telescope, hence please help me.   How many bodies can I see using a 90x telescope? How will I know when and where I should point a telescope to see planets?  "
2044,Are wormholes even possible?,"While this question could fall under Space Exploration or Physics (I don't have the ""best"" reputation on THAT forum), I feel that it is very much related to how the universe itself functions, especially regarding Einstein. While looking to see if anyone has confirmed our universe having a 4th spatial dimension (or some non temporal or spatial dimension) due to the fact that space curves, for me curvature requires a higher dimension (paper bending or a stick bending, always +1 to its dimension), I was met with the explanation that this ""curvature"" was intrinsic and not extrinsic (requiring another dimension). That was fine and all until I realized that wormholes would be exclusively extrinsic, how could you make a wormhole if bending space is intrinsic? Obviously you can't. But Einstein  put a lot of time into something that apparently wouldn't work, so personally I am siding with Einstein here. But that still leaves the question; Are wormholes possible thus making our universe a 3+1+1 dimensional universe (I wouldn't group it up with the 3 because that would say that matter could move like that, it can't) or are wormholes impossible and so our universe remains 3+1 dimensional? "
2045,Dark enough to see stars during total solar eclipse?,"I was fortunate enough to see totality during the eclipse of 2017 August 21.  It did leave me wondering about the 1919 Eddington experiment, though.  During totality, it only got dark enough to see a few of the brightest objects like Venus and Jupiter.  It was more like twilight than night that way.    So how were they able to see and photograph stars in the 1919 eclipse?  Do skies get darker during some total eclipses than others?  Was there more light scattering in my case, from being in a populated area?  Or do the right optics let you photograph stars during twilight-like conditions? "
2046,Is there a way to know how the magnetic field was at the very beginning of our universe?,"I recently read that      Gamma-ray bursts are catastrophic events, related to the explosion of massive stars 50 times the size of our sun. If you ranked all the explosions in the universe based on their power, gamma-ray bursts would be right behind the Big Bang,   I'm asking this question in the tentative to compare the Big Bang to a gamma-ray burst. I keep in mind that a key difference between both is that Big Bang was Not an explosion, but want to know similarities to point out.  Near the formation of a black-hole they tell in this same article that matter and magnetic field play a key role the gamma-ray bursts.  I know magnetic fields are induced by charge displacement. Is it possible there was a kind magnetic field before protons and electrons formed, or during the first expansion phase?  Here are pictures I modified from Wikipedia's chronology of the universe to illustrate:    Do we have a way to know how magnetic fields were at that time?   Close-up (image borrowed from donsnotes ):     Any way we could have information on magnetism at this point of universe creation?   In the Electroweak Era? During the Great Unification Theory (GUT) Era? And then in the Plank Era?   "
2047,Can I measure the moon's gravity?,"Since I learned about Newton's gravity law, I wonder if I can measure the moon's gravity using (almost) no special equipment. The best I could come up with is a pendulum, which is in a resting position. The moon (at the horizon) will pull on the weight at the bottom of the pendulum and cause it to shift. 6 hours later, with the moon above or below the pendulum, the weight should be back. Maybe we could detect the shift, just like we see the tides.     Running the math for a 5 meter long pendulum and 1 kg mass, I get an amplitude of 0,017 mm. I fear that external forces (wind, unstable surface, ...) will be bigger than this effect.   So my question is: is it possible (again, without specific equipment) to measure or detect the moon's gravitational force? What would be the best way to measure/detect it? "
2048,What are evidences of stationarity of rotation of galaxies,"Recently I have found the article Does There Really Exist the Problem of the Dark Matter in Spiral Galaxies? which states that dark matter does not exist because astronomers are wrong assuming stationarity of galaxy rotation.  According to them Doppler measurements give only one component of speed which is insufficiebt to restore full three dimensional vector. So they claim that stars in galaxies are on escape tragectories but reproduce correst rotational curves if we assume stationarity of rotation.  What are evidences that this is not true, what about measurements of proper motions, not doppler shifts only? "
2049,What is the projected range of the JWST to be able to detect exoplanet atmospheres?,"Yesterday the K2 mission detected transit events of objects passing in front of a number of M dwarfs which could turn out to be rocky planets. If some of these planets host atmospheres, could the JWST detect IR absorption lines from molecules in these atmospheres?  What would be the expected limiting distance for these stars to allow for such measurements by the JWST? "
2050,"""Turn on point"" for fusion?","I've read that when a body reaches about 13 times the mass of Jupiter that deuterium fusion starts and the body becomes a brown dwarf instead of a planet.  I have a multiple question.   Are there any other factors besides mass and possibly metal abundance (composition) that would determine this ""turn on"" point ? If the ""brown dwarf"" was detected indirectly and no spectroscopic information was available, could we assume that metalicity would be the same as the larger star ? Would a higher metallicity body ""turn on"" at a lower mass? (Would a difference between [Fe/H] = -0.19 and [Fe/H] = +0.07 make much of a difference in ""turn on mass""?)   *I did miss the related question when I posted this one, but I do have a question here that wasn't answered. It was about how stellar metallicity effects the onset of fusion. I think it may be as simple as whether or not adding ""metals"" makes the core hotter or colder for a given mass. I also wanted to know if I could assume that both ""stars"" in a binary system should have the same metallicity.  *Now that I've read Rob's excellent (as usual) answer, I would be curious as to how long deuterium fusion lasts in brown dwarfs from 13 to 80 Jupiter masses and what happens (in models) when it stops. "
2051,Why is it not always light?,"Hopefully this is not a silly question, but I was wondering why earth is not always in the light (and any other planet for that matter). I mean, we have billions of stars just in our galaxy that all give off light from all directions. That light has obviously reached is as we can see them shimmering in the night sky.   With that in mind, what has happened to the light from the stars? Has it weakened somehow? (didn't think that was possible) Surely if we are being hit with light from all directions, it makes sense that we should always be illuminated. So what's going on here?  "
2052,Generating random galaxy catalogs for correlation functions,"The galaxy correlation function, when computed directly from a galaxy catalog, relies on computing a randomly generated counterpart catalog.  When dealing with a simulated galaxy mock-catalog, where the sample of galaxies is roughly uniform over a large box (e.g. the galaxy mocks created from Millennium/Millennium II), the random catalog can be just be a uniform distribution of points in the same volume as the real data.  However, real-world galaxy catalogs are not homogenous boxes, and have very irregular shapes and observationally induced redshift and angular distributions. Even some mock-catalogs are endowed with these properties to better represent real data. In these cases, how is a random catalog best produced? With some sort of probability distribution in coordinates which attempts to mimic the ""non-physical"" (i.e. not due to observational constraints) part of the distribution? Or a simple binary mask which filters out empty regions, but otherwise leaves the random catalog uniform.  If the answer is that some nonuniform distribution should be used, is there a usual method for doing so? The literature I have found (e.g. for the SDSS published data, and for galaxy mocks mimicking SDSS's constraints) does not discuss this in any way. Note, if this is a highly involved process beyond a brief summary and a source or two, I do not expect a full answer here. Rather, I am trying to determine if there is an existing set of standard methods which are documented but have eluded me thus far. "
2053,infinite Universe,"I was watching a documentary and they said that Cosmologists have determined that the Universe is infinite. I find this to contradict the expansion theory. If the Universe had a starting point then how could it be infinite ? It can only reach out as far as it has expanded in the age of the Universe, 13.8 billion years . If it was infinite then it would not be expanding because it would already reach out to infinity. I hope it is clear what it is that I am trying to say ? "
2054,What is the condition for the number density of a gas to be ultra-relativistic or non-relativistic and degenerate or ideal,"What is the condition for the number density ([tex]) of a gas to be ultra-relativistic or non-relativistic and degenerate or ideal?  I found problems in this subject when I was reading about White-Dwarfs.   A book said [tex] or [tex] is the condition for being degenerate or ideal (classical), respectively. And [tex]. Is this condition right? I know where [tex] comes from but I don't know what it really shows.  In that book it is said that [tex] is the condition for being ultra-relativistic for a degenerate gas and [tex] is the condition for being ultra-relativistic for an ideal gas. Where do these equations come from? What is [tex] ?  In another way, my question is mainly about this diagram and about how we can get the lines in this diagram.   Credit: The Physics of Stars, A.C.Phillips     [tex] Boltzmann constant [tex] Planck constant [tex] light speed [tex] is number density, not the number of particles [tex] is the quantum concentration number for ultra-relativistic particles  "
2055,Online wide-field star cameras?,"Where can I find a large list of online star cameras with wide fields of view?  [website]Is there a better site or sites to see wide-field star images?  I realize there are several online telescopes, but they all have a small limited field of view (which makes sense), so you can only see small portions of the sky at once, not the entire sky as above. "
2056,Do we know how old the matter that makes us is?,"Last weekend, I had the pleasure of visiting an observatory where there was a series of lectures to cover up the fact that there was too much cloud cover to actually observe much at all.  One of these lectures involved the life-cycles of stars, which mainly involves Hydrogen and Helium.  Out of curiosity, I raised the question     How old is the matter that make us and where does it come from?   The ""where"" is covered by Nucleosynthesis, but the ""how old"" was shrugged away with ""maybe 2-3 sun lifetimes"".  Is it possible to more accurately estimate the age of the matter that made up our solar system's accretion disk?  Or is the likely source of the supernova/collisions involved unlikely to be known? "
2057,TRAPPIST 1 and planet statistics?,"From what I understand, the TRAPPIST 1 system was discovered using the transiting method looking at 20 ultra-cool small stars. I'm not sure how many have been observed since this study.  What I wonder is, what would we expect to see if all 20 had planets? I'm not sure how many planetary systems in this and future similar studies we would expect to see edge on. What about radial velocity measurements?  Did we just get lucky with TRAPPIST 1? "
2058,I too saw a star like object moving across the sky it appeared to be a star moving!,"I too saw a star like object moving across the sky from Bournemouth towards say Parkstone, it appeared to be a star moving for quite a long time until it disappeared from my view! I have seen this the last two nights and so have my family, it's not the Space Station as I see this regularly as my Star Walk app, you can add in when you know what the object is! But unless I know the name of this object I can't track it on my app, does anyone know what it could Be? It is not a plane as far too high like a star moving but fast across the sky? This was timed 22:10 on Sunday August 28th 2017 "
2059,Do all orbiting objects have barycenters?,"From the simple perspective of someone like myself, it appears that our sun is ""fixed in place"" (from the perspective of the solar system itself) and that everything else of lower mass orbits around it.  I suspect that the sun wobbles due to the other objects (that the barycenter is either near it or within its radius).  It appears from reading about binary stars of more-or-less equal mass that they cannot have one ""fixed in place"" and the other orbiting it.  The barycenter is basically between them.  Is that perspective correct?  Is it ever possible for a low mass star to be the ""fixed in place"" center with a large mass star orbiting it?  Or does the barycenter always shift toward the more massive object? "
2060,Primordial supermassive black holes. How old are they?,"I know that astronomers have detected supermassive black holes in the early universe. What was the age of the universe at which these black holes were detected?  In other words how long is it thought to take for these supermassive black holes to form and what are the mechanisms by which they formed, other than from supermassive stars? "
2061,Where will I be able to see the Lyrid meteor shower?,"So supposedly the Lyrids meteor shower will take place between early morning April 16th to 22nd - correct me if I am wrong. I am aged 15 and am interested in skywatching, I just wondered will it be visible from the northern Hemisphere? Or will it be like the lunar eclipse and only be visible in the Western Hemisphere? Thanks. "
2062,Generate an uniform distribution on the sky,"How to generate an uniform distribution of stars on the sky ? What I want is make a simulation of random points following uniform distribution on a part of the sky (making the assuption that we have the same amount of stars in any direction). The problem is how I do that because of the cos(dec) on the RA ?  What I did in python is this  import numpy as np RA = np.random.uniform(-180,180) Dec = np.random.uniform(-90,90)   But it is totally false, since we will have more points on the poles (if I do many points, this will clearly not be uniform)...  Thanks a lot in advance! "
2063,How far away is this galaxy?,"Arp 299 is in the news, with most sources reporting it as 140 or 150 million light-years away. But what kind of distance is this?  The paper which is trhe source for the news item has Supplementary Materials which mention the distance but don't appear to say what kind or give details:     The merging pair of galaxies Arp 299 (Fig. 1) at a 44.8 Mpc distance (33; corrected to the cosmic microwave background reference frame; H0 = 73 km s^-1 Mpc^-1) is one of the brightest nearby LIRGs with an IR luminosity LIR ~ 7x10^11 L_⊙ (34; L_⊙ = 3.833×10^26 W).   Is it obvious what method is used (and thus what type of distance this is) to measure the distance to this galaxy? Is there a standard reference/database/etc. giving basic information like distances of astronomical objects like galaxies? I'd like to know the answer for this galaxy, but answers that generalize will naturally be more interesting.    Edward L. Wright has a cosmology calculator that is useful in converting between different types of distances. His page on distances gives many methods for measuring distances; I feel that if I knew which type (if any) of these methods was used to find the distance I'd have a decent chance of figuring out what kind of distance it was (and could find the other distances by bisection).

2064,How to improve efficiency in periodicity detection?,"Our data set has [tex] data points, but has a long baseline and many gaps.  If we bin the data, there would be [tex] data points ([tex]), but only about 1% are non-zero values.  How to improve the detection efficiency?   Is a multi-threading way possible (especially for Lomb-Scargle)?  For example, if I use LombScargle in astropy.stats,  freq, power = LombScargle.autopower(minimum_frequency=0.5, maximum_frequency=1.5, normalization='standard')   there are two problems:   It is slow and easy to get memoryError. It can't utilize the computing power as much as possible.   So my question is about the efficiency. For the data set above, what is the best method? "
2065,Red Moon a Characteristic of all Total Lunar Eclipses?,"I understand that the redness of the moon during the total lunar eclipse last night/this morning (April 14-15 2014) is a reflection of the red light caused in earth's atmosphere due to Rayleigh scattering (basically, a reflection of all the sunsets and sunrises happening around the earth).  Because of this, it seems to me that the moon will appear red during every total lunar eclipse that happens.  Is this the case, or are there some lunar eclipses where the moon does not turn red?  If it is the case that all total lunar eclipses produce a red moon, why was the media so hyped up about last night's eclipse producing a red moon?  Was it especially red? "
2066,What is visible light colour output of different stars?,"I know the colours of the stars relate to their heat, however if I were standing on a different planet identical to Earth, but orbiting a blue Bright Giant or a Red Giant, or perhaps even a Red Dwarf, what colours in visible light would I be able to see? Is it the same as with our star, i.e. would any be missing such as if I'm in a room with a black light? "
2067,"Is there an example of a star that is already dead, but can still be seen on Earth?","While looking up at the stars I wondered, what are the odds that some of them are already dead. I did some research and found a very interesting article here. It states that the odds are rather small, so it is not like about 50% of the stars we see are already dead.  But I still wonder if there is an example of a star we know to be already gone, while it is still visible on earth.  As far as I know, the only way to find out is to watch the stars light. So if the light ""goes out"", we know the star has been gone for quite some time. Assuming this to be fact, I would have to conclude that such an example does not (and cannot) exist.  Is this true? Or is there in fact a star that is already dead that we know of, which can be seen in the sky?  PS: By ""seeing the star"" I am talking about a star that looks just like any other star in the night sky (not, for instance, a visible supernova).  Edit: If there is such a star, how did we find out it is already gone? "

2070,The formation of absorption lines in solar spectrum,"It is said that absorption lines originate from regions higher in the photosphere where the gas is cooler.   The gas should be absorbing photons, then re-emitting them... absorb, re-emit, absorb, re-emit...  My question is where are the photons produced by re-emission? Why are there absorption lines?   Although photons could be scattered, photons at other places could be scattered to our line our sight. Surely the total number of photons does not drop the further out you go? So while photons originally headed in the direction of an observer are possibly absorbed and re-emitted in a direction away from the observer, surely this will be made up for by a photon being emitted from another location in the direction of the observer? Otherwise wouldn't there be a location somewhere else where a bunch of extra scattered photons can be observed?   If we integrate all the photons at the lower surface of the photosphere A and integrated all the photons at the upper surface of the chromosphere C, surely there are the same number of photons? Otherwise, where have they gone? Where is the lost energy?  Are there less photons emitted from the surface C because some have been emitted back down into the Sun? But that has to reach an equilibrium, or there would be a cascading increase in the number of photons inside the sun.   "

2072,Angular Diameter Distance,"The definition of the angular diameter distance is the ratio of an object's physical transverse size to its angular size. However when I was reading my textbook, Astrophysics in a Nutshell by Dan Maoz pp.220-221, I am having some trouble trying to understand the notion of angular diameter distance to the last scattering surface. The text calculates the angular diameter distance to the last scattering surface [tex]:     Consider flat cosmology (k=0) with no cosmological constant. We wish to calculate the angular size on the sky, as it appears today of a region of physical size   [tex] from which light was emitted at time [tex]. Between recombination and the present time, the Universal expansion is matter-dominated, with [tex] for this model   [tex]   and hence we can write   [tex]   The angle subtended by the region equals its size, divided by its distance to us at the   time of emission (since that is when the angle between rays emanating from two   sides of the region was set).     I'm not sure what does the last line actually mean..Can someone please elaborate more on this? I just simply take the [tex] as the ""physical transverse size"".     As we are concerned with observed angles, the type   of distance we are interested in is the distance which, when squared and multiplied   by 4π, will give the area of the sphere centered on us and passing through the   said region. If the comoving radial coordinate of the surface of last scattering is r, the required distance is currently just [tex] and is called the proper motion distance. The proper motion distance can be solved using null geodesic in the FRW metric   [tex]   Setting k = 0, and substituting   [tex] and integrate   [tex]      So I take this as the physical distance of the region from us. The next part is what confuse me:     However, at the time of emission, the scale factor of the Universe was 1 + z times smaller. The so-called angular diameter distance to the last scattering surface is therefore   [tex]     How does a physical distance [tex] comes into play in the angular diameter distance, because from its definition it is just [tex]??

Can a giant planet's gravity pull out its moons atmosphere?Is gravity enough to pull its atmosphere or do we need an instantaneous force/impact to blow away an atmosphere? 
2075,"Why is the Warm-Hot Intergalactic Medium (WHIM) so hot, and what is ""collisionless shock heating""?","The Phys.org article Researchers find last of universe's missing ordinary matter says:     Ordinary matter, or ""baryons,"" make up all physical objects in existence, from stars to the cores of black holes. But until now, astrophysicists had only been able to locate about two-thirds of the matter that theorists predict was created by the Big Bang.      In the new research, an international team pinned down the missing third, finding it in the space between galaxies. That lost matter exists as filaments of oxygen gas at temperatures of around 1 million degrees Celsius, said CU Boulder's Michael Shull, a co-author of the study.   and refers to F. Nicastro et al, Observations of the missing baryons in the warm–hot intergalactic medium, Nature (2018). DOI: 10.1038/s41586-018-0204-1  The Wikipedia page Warm–hot intergalactic medium says:     Part of the gravitational energy supplied by these effects is converted into thermal emissions of the matter by collisionless shock heating   but the link to ""collisionless"" is ambiguous and I haven't a clue how a shock wave can get hot without collisions.  Is there a way to understand why is the Warm-Hot Intergalactic Medium (WHIM) is so hot, and what the ""collisionless shock heating"" process is that appears to be heating it?  Are the temperatures associated with the motion of the atoms and with the excited states of the atoms similar? With only of order 1 atom per cubic meter, collisions must be so infrequent that it seems to me that it might not be so hard for these two temperatures to diverge. "
2076,Is blue light not traveling faster then red light in space?,"I just can't understand why light and other massless particles are not traveling at different speeds?  Gravity effects anything with a mass but light has no mass but a black hole, and weak lensing changes the trajectory of light to create more red shifted light more than blue shifted light. That tells me light has mass. Can someone clarify this to me in Laymons terminology?  Pictures would be helpful. "
2077,How wary should I be of old cosmology books?,"Recently I bought a couple of books on cosmology from a second-hand bookshop. One was published in 1993 and the other is from the 1970.  I know, from a recent book, that the inflaton theory is probably newer than both books and that the Higgs Boson has been discovered, but that is all that I know has changed recently in the field of cosmology. Has anything else changed since then?  Which topics of the books should I understand are considered outdated?    The two books are Modern Cosmology by Jagjit Singh (published 1961 and rereleased in 1970) and Afterglow of Creation by Marcus Chown (published in 1993)  "
2078,Can a black hole be torn apart by SMBHs?,"Suppose two SMBHs (supermassive black holes) are brought close (e.g. during a galactic merger). Suppose that a ""normal"" black hole drifts into the space between the SMBHs. Could the gravitational pull of the SMBHs be sufficient to tear the normal black hole to pieces?  If so, will we be able to examine the fragments, free from being obscured by the black hole's event horizon? "
2079,What are the possible star fuels?,"I always thought the only fuel for a star was hydrogen, which is fused into helium.

Besides hydrogen, what are the possible fuels in a star’s core? "
2080,Would the dynamic pressure of the Sun’s solar wind be strong enough to trap plasma ions within an open container?,"If you were to place a long cylinder, open at one end and closed at the other end, and position this cylinder so that the open end is facing the Sun, and then you were to inject plasma ions, such as oxygen ions, into the cylinder near the closed end, would the solar wind entering the open end of the cylinder be strong enough to keep the oxygen ions pinned against the closed end of the cylinder, effectively trapping them there? How close to the Sun would this cylinder need to be for the solar wind to be strong enough to 'entrap' these oxygen ions? "
2081,Long term temperature effects of an eclipse,"I was surprised to see a very measurable difference in temperature at my home during the recent solar eclipse.  The temperature was about 93 degrees fahrenheit but dropped to around 86 degrees.  It made me wonder how an unusual eclipse might affect a planetary body.   If there were a situation where someone had put an object into a stable synchronous orbit that would block a percentage of solar radiation, how big would it have to be for an appreciable effect?  An example would be from Futurama's Crimes of the Hot episode Wernstom's giant parabolic mirror that reflected 40% of all sunlight. If an effect similar to a solar eclipse would be prolonged over a specific area, how would that effect the local atmosphere?  I would assume it would create a stable ""cold front"" in that area.  Is there any information on how that would affect other passing cold or warm fronts?  "
2082,Exactly how does Canis Minor look like a dog?,"Here's what Canis Minor looks like.    To me, all I see is two stars. Canis Minor is a constellation of the giant Orion's hunting dog. Two stars can give quite a meaning. Two stars can mean a stick, a telescope, et cetera. But how could that be interpreted as a dog?  Since this is a Greek constellation, are there any sources that explain why ancient Greeks considered those two stars to represent a dog? "
2083,Does Doppler shift affect apparent pulsar frequency?,"We know that redshift and blueshift is the result of the frequency of light waves reflected or emitted by an object lengthening or shortening due to the relative velocity of the observer moving away or toward the object. This is the Doppler effect.  However, it was stated in response to a question I asked on a sister site that the Doppler effect would also result in the apparent frequency of a pulsar's pulses being longer or shorter due to the relative velocity of the star. Given that the speed of light is constant regardless of the frame of reference (a concept I have a really hard time understanding by the way), is this correct?  My thinking is that it is incorrect. Using the analogy of a launcher lobbing medicine balls at me at a fixed rate, I can ""see"" the rate of launch by the frequency of when I get hit. However, if the launcher is moving away from me, the velocity of the balls lobbed at me will be slower (relative to my frame of reference), and thus will hit me with less frequency. However, if the launcher were to adjust its firing speed (i.e. speed of the ball relative to itself; frequency remains constant in this analogy) so that the balls always hit me at the same speed (thereby simulating the concept of the always-fixed speed of light), the time between them would not change.  So, given the always-constant speed of light, is it correct that a pulsar's pulse rate would appear to be different at different relative velocities? "
2084,is this really true that speed of light is same as we look from different parts of universe?,According to the theory of relativity. The speed of light is same for every observer. But how can we know that this applies to more than a local region? What if light travelled to us from a distant region where the speed of light was different or where the relativistic principle did not apply?  Can we design an experiment that refutes both these ideas? 
2085,Python: Find brightest pixel in fits-file and ignore brighter artefacts,"I have 4000 fits-files images from SPITZER, each containing the same star over a time period. Each image is a photmetry cube of 32 pixel * 32 pixel * 64 consequent time frames. I need to look through all the single frames and order the pixel by brightness. Not hard to do with Python, but sometimes I have in the frames short-lived events/artefacts which are brighter than the brightest pixel of the star (see below). These artefacts last only over one or two consequent time frames  How can I easily correct for the artefacts? Is there an astropy/pyfits package that does this? Or some kind of bad pixel flagging in SPITZER (I know that Kepler-images have flagging of bad pixel)?  Optional: It would be convenient to have the code in vectorized form, avoiding loops, so that I save computtional time     Fig: In the left frame everything is normal, in the right frame, in the top right corner you see one of the artefacts, having a value below a saturation treshhold   "

2090,How far away is the nearest compact star remnant likely to be?,"Neutron stars and black holes are hard to detect when they are solitary, and there seems to be big uncertainties about how common they are. White dwarfs are much easier to detect and the nearest one is Sirius B only 2.6 parsec from here. Should we expect to have exotic company even closer by? How likely is it that we have a yet undetected compact star remnant nearby, as in as close as our nearest active star? What are the odds of spotting one of them nearby?  How could a yet undetected one be discovered? Could one of the upcoming sky surveying telescopes catch it or would one have to rely on a rare microlensing event? How would it then be observed? Would such an exotic object, say, just one parsec away, give important insights in physics given its relativistic effects and strange composition? "
2091,Efficiently calculating power spectra from galaxy catalogs,"I am dealing with a problem which requires calculating either the correlation function or the power spectrum. At times, the 2-point-correlator seems the better route, at others, the PS. Right now I am having some questions about how to practically calculate a PS.  Here is the basic setup: I have a mock galaxy catalog. Let's say I want the PS. I could Fourier transform the 2PC, but let's say I want to avoid working with a 2PC code. So instead, I make the assumption that the galaxies trace the density field (it helps that I have the DM halo masses from the underlying simulation which produced the mock).  I bin the galaxy catalog, giving me a coarse-grained list of masses for each bin, [tex]. It is trivial to turn this into a density contrast list [tex].  There are a couple of options now to proceed to calculating the PS. Formally, the PS is given by $$ P(k) \sim \langle \, |\tilde \delta(\vec{k})|^2 \,\rangle $$  up to some normalization, with [tex] being the fourier transform of [tex], the full density contrast field, and the angle brackets denoting volume averaging. The seemingly natural thing to do would then be   FFT my binned list [tex] get list of values [tex] average this list to get the PS [tex], now just a function of [tex] instead of [tex]-space position.   This is potentially problematic for me, as unless I bin over large scales, the memory required to store the zeros present in the array of binned values is too large. With the data I have, binning at $ \sim 10[tex]/h$ spaces or greater is needed to get a managable array.  My solution for calculating the 2PC was to avoid calculating an array entirely, and instead performing a regrouping operation to bin the catalog. This keeps the memory usage proportional to the catalog length instead of to the binning resolution cubed. However, it effectively means I am dealing with a sparse density array, which AFAIK cannot be used directly in most existing FFT codes.  This leaves me with a dilemma. I can either coarse-grain my density array [tex] even more, losing information at [tex] Mpc scales, or else I suppose I could interpolate the density, giving me a full function [tex] that I could pass some coarser mesh into, and then pass into an FFT. The problem with interpolating is that this operation requires the (now implicit) knowledge of the empty cells in the sparse array.  On the other hand, one SO post has a comment suggesting to merely calculate the Fourier integral instead of using FFT methods. I fear this would still present a problem, as this takes the time complexity from [tex] to [tex], and [tex] for me is [tex] or higher (becoming as high as [tex]).  Am I missing something? I feel like people calculate PS and 2PC's all the time for catalogs this large, and like my attempts at solving this issue could be flawed. My precise question is, are my options just as I have laid out, or is there another way of handling this calculation I have not described? "

Can someone provide a written reference – textbook, manual, article, or similar – where this notation is explained?   I checked this question, but it didn't really help me. I also checked the Guide to the Expression of Uncertainty in Measurement, published by the Joint Committee for Guides in Metrology (JCGM), formed by various organizations (BIPM, IEC, IFCC, ILAC, ISO, IUPAC, IUPAP, OIML). It is a standard for nomenclature and practice in reporting uncertainty, and makes important distinctions, for example between ""coverage intervals"" and ""confidence intervals"" (see JCGM 101:2008 definitions 3.12–3.16).

The refraction is visible because at at least some depth, the density and path length is sufficient to bend the light significantly while the density and composition is still sufficiently transparent.   Roughly speaking, what is the density where this is taking place? Is it rarefied compared to earth but simply a very very long path length, or is this happening at a density far larger than Earth's surface atmosphere? How large is this refraction -  like 0.1 degrees or 10 degrees? I can't picture the actual geometry very well.

2110,How does the Large Binocular Telescope resolve so well in both orthogonal directions simultaneously?,"The Forbes article Ask Ethan: How Does Very-Long-Baseline Interferometry Allow Us To Image A Black Hole? includes an example of optical interferometry from the Large Binocular Telescope, shown below.     The occultation of Jupiter's moon, Io, with its erupting volcanoes Loki and Pele, as occulted by Europa, which is invisible in this infrared image. The Large Binocular Telescope was able to do this owing to the technique of interferometry. Credit: LBTO    related: When will the next series of mutual eclipses of Jupiter's moons begin?   The LBTO consists of only two telescopes 8.4 m (330 inch) wide mirrors, with centres 14.4 m apart, so I would expect to see higher resolution in one direction than the other.  However in this GIF the resolution seems to be the same in both directions. While I see high spatial frequency ringing in the horizontal direction, I don't see any difference in resolution.   Since the event is so fast (probably minutes or seconds) there is no chance that the natural rotation of the baseline during the course of a night could have helped.  So I'd like to ask How does the Large Binocular Telescope resolve so well in both orthogonal directions simultaneously?

2111,How is a non-rotating black hole created, How are non-rotating black holes formed?   I guess that non-rotating black holes are formed from non-rotating stars but I couldn't find any proof that such a star exists on the internet. If this is true can you also put up an example of such a star?   Does the matter absorption of a non-rotating black hole differ from a rotating black hole?  
2112,Why does the Moon appear gray when passing between the Sun and the Earth?,"Shouldn't the Moon appear as bright as a full Moon seen at midnight from Earth?    The photo was taken by DSCOVR at Lagrange point 1.  In the picture, The Moon appears dark gray. Of course the Earth appears bright, reflecting sunlight from clouds and water. The Moon's surface is gray and should reflect less light than the Earth.  It should be irrelevant that we see the far side, since the reflectivity of the Moon's surface should be the same on the far side as the side that faces the Earth.  The midnight full Moon appears much, much brighter as seen from Earth than it does in this picture, despite the fact that the amount of sunlight reflecting from the surface of the Moon is the same in both instances.  I understand the photo was taken with 3 separate exposures of red, blue and green, but this should not affect the brightness.  So why does it appear so dull? "
2113,Why was helium hydride (HeH+) the universe's first molecule?,"The abstract of the new Nature paper Astrophysical detection of the helium hydride ion HeH+ tell us that infrared spectroscopy from SOFIA detected      ...rotational ground-state transition of HeH+ at a wavelength of 149.1 micrometres in the planetary nebula NGC 7027.   It also says:     In this metal-free and low-density environment, neutral helium atoms formed the Universe’s first molecular bond in the helium hydride ion HeH+ through radiative association with protons. As recombination progressed, the destruction of HeH+ created a path to the formation of molecular hydrogen.    Question: Why was helium hydride (HeH+) the universe's first molecule? Why was it the hydrogen helium cation rather than the dihydrogen cation? "
2114,Does interstellar cloud obstruct or reduce the visibility?,"We just pictured a medium distant black hole by combining data from various observatories around the world. That's when I wondered if interstellar cloud blocks the visibility at multiple position in the same direction in space such that we never accurately know the exact luminosity and distance between the black hole and Earth? I was not able to find much information about this particular subject so,     Is it possible that the interstellar cloud reduces the visibility of an object behind it? And if so, is it possible that we are only able to observe interstellar cloud upto a certain distance in space?  If we observe a star that is behind a interstellar cloud, how do we determine the luminosity of the star?  Can we accurately filter out interstellar cloud that are separated by x distance but at the same direction?  "
2115,Why are there no more images revealed by New Horizon?,Since a few days after the flyby there are no more images published on the NASA page.  Why is NASA waiting to publish any more images for some reason?  Or is there something happened to New Horizon? 
2116,Do contracting objects show redshift?,"If we consider a point on the central part of a contracting object as observed from earth, the point is continuously moving away from us as the object contracts. Moreover, light emerges from a deeper gravitational well as the object contracts. So, shouldn't contracting objects show a redshift? And if so it should be less towards the edges than towards the centre, right? "
2117,Is our sun in a star cluster?,"Sorry for the absolute begginer question here, but is our sun a part of some globular cluster? It is something related to Virgo supercluster? "
2118,What is the origin of the dust near the sun?,"In this question I asked about the Solar Probe Plus mission. Reading a 2008 report I saw that there is an elevated exposure to high velocity dust near the sun. I understand the high velocity, anything in orbit that close will be moving fast, but I don't understand why there is dust there.   Simply put - wouldn't the gravity pull it in or the solar wind blow it away?   What is the origin of the refractory carbon and silicates? Is this orbiting leftover material from the formation of the solar system, or is it falling in from farther out, or is it left-over carbon and silicon that fell into the early forming sun and is now being blown back out?     4.3.5 Micrometeoroid and Dust. Solar Probe+ will encounter dust particles ranging in diameter from submicron up to several hundred microns and consisting of highly refractory carbon and silicate species with a typical bulk density of ~2.5 g/cm2. The particles will be traveling at relative speeds as high as 350 km/s. To define the shielding requirements for Solar Probe+, a dust model was developed based primarily on the work of Mann et al. (2004). The model employs the following assumptions...     above: screen shot from SolarProbePlus2008    above: screen shot from NASA's Solar Probe Plus Fact Sheet    above: illustration of NASA's Solar Probe Plus from here.

2119,"Why does the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) not include telescopes from Africa, Asia or Australia?","The Event Horizon Telescope seems to include these radio telescopes currently:   Image by European Southern Observatory (ESO)/O. Furtak; CC-BY 4.0-licensed, see the source on Wikipedia Commons and the original image link.  See also the map and list on their official website.  It is also said, that it has a “effective diameter of the entire planet”. But it's striking, it does not include half-of the earth… It has no telescopes in Africa, Asia or Australia.  So:   Why were not they included? Would it increase the diameter if they would include some from there? If so, again why did not they? (😉) Or, similarly asked: How can it be the diameter of the earth if only half-the-earth is included in the network?   Please try to explain it in a simple way first. I am no astronomer.     What I've noticed so far when skimming their official pages is that they write here:     As more telescopes are added to the EHT, we will be able to produce images of the emission around black holes. In general, the fidelity of images produced by an interferometric array increases as additional telescopes are added to the array.    This seems to support my question of why they did not use possibilities in Asia or so… I guess, it would also make sense to have a more or less uniform distribution across the planet (or does not this matter?), that's why a ""dot"" in Africa might make sense too… "
2120,How would Alpha Centauri A appear from the surface of Alpha Centauri Bb?,"I'm trying to imagine what a hypothetical observer on the surface of Alpha Centauri Bb would see in the daytime sky. I know it would vary depending on the orbit of b around B, as well as the position of B and A in relation to each other.  What would the ""sun"" in the sky look like at different times on Bb? I know that at times B and A would overlap and appear as a single sun, but what about when they don't? "
2121,Where is the intervening light in the M87 black hole?,"The M87 black hole is at the centre, more or less, of an elliptical galaxy of 1 trillion or more stars. So certainly there are stars and other light emitting objects (emission nebula e.g.) in the intervening 53 million light years between earth and the black hole.  How is it that the centre of the black hole image is perfectly dark, as if it is being observed directly, with not one point of light between the black hole and earth? I appreciate that space is mostly empty, but do we really have an unobscured line of sight to a black hole in the centre of an enormous elliptical galaxy?  Does it have something to do with the type of light being observed? "
2122,IAU Dwarf planet definition Point 2.b - is not a satellite,"I am a bit confused with point 2.d of the IAU's resolution on dwarf planets.     (2) A ""dwarf planet"" is a celestial body that      (a) is in orbit around the Sun      (b) has sufficient mass for its self-gravity to overcome rigid body forces so that it assumes a hydrostatic equilibrium (nearly round) shape      (c) has not cleared the neighbourhood around its orbit      (d) is not a satellite.   [website]I notice that a lot of websites exclude this point all together? Some of them even rather combine it with point 2.a ? Like over here  Feels a bit redundant, since orbits the sun implies not orbiting a planet?  Or am I missing something here?  "
2123,Are we looking for brown dwarfs where the dark matter has to be?,"We have been repeatedly assured that their ain't enough brown dwarfs to account for all the dark matter in our galaxy.  My question is have we been looking in the right places?  Or in more detail. Where exactly does computer modelling put the missing mass?   I would expect the bulk of it to be on the galaxy's plain and on the edge. And if I am not mistaken there is too much junk in the way to look.  Further I can't see any reason why the dark matter won't be unevenly distributed in clumps just like everything else.   So, given the above an extrapolation from what we have detected will be way low if it assumes an even distribution in all directions, and horribly low if the LMG and GMG happen to be between clumps.  "
2124,Does tidal heating imply orbit degradation?,What compensate the energy loss in tidal heating? Is it orbital decay? 
2125,Why hasn't the Earth fallen into the sun yet?,"So the Earth's been orbiting the sun in a relatively stable orbit for billions of years now. during that time, it's been plowing through dust, and hit by comets and asteroids, presumably mostly from the outer reaches more than the inner parts of the solar system.  Even if the drag and increased mass should amount to a tiny, tiny fraction of Earth's mass, shouldn't that have been enough to cause our orbit to spiral inwards? Both due to slowing of the Earth's motion, and an increase in mass?  Thanks! "
2126,What resolution would earth-moon telescope achieve?,Event horizon achieved earth-size telescope by using  seperate telescopes around the world to interpolate an image of a black hole at resolution of 60 arcmicroseconds.  What resolution could we get if we built radio telescopes on the moon and used earth-moon orbit to interpolate an image? What could we see with it?  What if we used earth-moon-mars telescope?  Would it make sense to go even bigger?  This is all assuming we would have possibilities to build local telescopes like ones on earth in future.

2129,Why are there no Oe or Ae stars?,The unique characteristics of Be stars are mainly because of their circumstellar discs. I wonder what makes Be stars special that only they have unique characteristics? Which kind of stars have discs generally? Why are there no Oe and Ae stars? 
2130,Are circumbinary and noncircumbinary habitable zones mutually exclusive?,"Could a binary star system have an earth-like planet orbiting star A, a second earth-like planet orbiting star B, AND a third earth-like planet in a stable circumbinary orbit? Or does the space that is required between the two stars to allow for stable habitable zone orbits for the first two planets eliminate the possibility of the third planet being both habitable and in a stable circumbinary orbit? "
2131,How are heavier elements such as carbon and silicon distributed within the Sun?,"In a previous question I asked about the source of carbon and silicate dust that Solar Probe Plus will encounter in its close flyby of the Sun. It seems likely that most sources would include infall from outside the solar system or fragments resulting from collisions inside the solar system.  But the Sun is believed to be about 0.4% carbon and 0.1% silicon by mass (see  here and here). I believe these represent the relative abundances during the formation of the Sun, but do not account for nucleosynthesis that early in the Sun's life.  Is the distribution of carbon and silicon in the Sun is believed to be uniform, or does it have a radially dependent distribution? Is there be any kind of gravitational settling, i.e. heavier atoms tending to move toward the center as happens in planets?  Since we can only directly measure elemental abundances directly near the surface using spectroscopic techniques, would the radial distribution come from some model or calculation? "
2132,"In the end what is the ultimate matter/element in the universe, due to fusion process in stars?","We know that, in stars, hydrogen is used by the stars and due to the fusion in two hydrogen elements we get helium -> Carbon -> Oxygen ->Other elements -> Iron -> then Super/Hypernova.  If everywhere hydrogen is getting converted to other element then will we(universe) have hydrogen to create/retain stars ?   Or in the end what is the ultimate matter in the universe ? "
2133,What is the farthest we can see into the universe?,Is there a limit in which the mass in space obscure the ability to detect anything farther even as technology progresses?  Related:   Can the range of the observable universe be extended through an intermediary? Which galaxy is receding from the Milky Way the fastest? What is known of the mechanism behind its recession?  
2134,Why the chosen orientation for the M87 black hole image?,"By now we are all familiar with the official image of the black hole in M87:    Now, in the universe, as far as I know, there is no up and down, nor left and right. All is relative. Hence my question: why the particular chosen angle of the image released? Why not instead release the image as, for example, below? Which is the point of reference chosen in the original image? Is it of any particular significance?   "
2135,Is it possible to witness a star's death?,"Given that the stars' distances to Earth are measured in light-years (for example, Sirius is 8.6 light-years away from Earth), what we are seeing as Sirius now is actually its state 8.6 years ago, right?  So it is possible that a star (maybe not Sirius, I don't know, it's just an example) somehow explodes and creates a supernova, and if this is the case, we will see this event 8.6 years later (I assume everything is right up to this point).  So my question is, is it possible for me while looking at the sky on a lucky day, suddenly see the explosion of a star that happened x years ago and be the first eye witness of this event? In other words, is there a technology on Earth (emphasis on ""on Earth"" here, the satellites or space shuttles do not count since they might be slightly closer to the star than the Earth is) that can see this before me?  My logic is that even the greatest telescope ""sees"" whatever light it receives. So since a telescope cannot increase the speed of light it receives, it shouldn't be more fast than me. And since light is the fastest way of transferring information, I assume that I am as possible as NASA to see such an event. Is there any way this assumption is wrong? "
2136,cosmic-microwave-background - 2.7 degrees but does the Big Bang care?,"The Big Bang is a proposed answer to the beginning of the universe, and the Cosmic Microwave Background or CMB is a central part of the evidence for it.  Now suppose the measurement returned a different value than 2.7K.  What if it were 0.27K or 27K?  Would the Big Bang theory still work with a few minor adjustments or is the specific temperature of 2.7K critical evidence that the theory works?  Edit: I have removed a paragraph which was not mine asking about small changes in temperature. It is a fundamentally different question. I am more interested in how firm the evidence for the BB theory is, not its details. At least for this question.  However if uhoh who seems to have done the editing thinks it a fair question, I would certainly welcome it - in another post.  "
2137,Why not capture also Milky Way's black hole image?,"The world has now seen the black hole ""close-up"" of M87.  Besides the recognition to how awesome science has become in the 21st century, I have the following question.  Didn't they work also to capture also an image of the Milky Way's black hole? While it is much closer, the image could also provide much more detail? "
2138,Why are tides biggest during the equinoxes?,"I've read that during the equinoxes, tides are at their maximum. Shouldn't this only apply to latitudes near the equator? I mean, when the solar declination is near to 0º and we have a full or new moon, the combined effect of the Sun's and Moon's gravity should create the highest tides, but only near the equator (see in wikipedia the article Tides, which says that equinoctial tides are maximum)  Is this true for other latitudes? "
2139,How do radio telescopes gather information about visible light?,"Is the first image of a black hole that was captured by the Event Horizon Telescope what would be seen with a large enough optical telescope (or with the naked eye from a proper distance of the black hole)? If so, how do radio telescopes gather information about visible light?   "
2140,Black hole at Galactic Center of the Milky way and Bar of stars?,"The Milky Way is a barred spiral galaxy, with a supermassive black hole at its center. Here  As it is a barred spiral galaxy, it has a central bar-shaped structure composed of stars.Here  So my questions are -:   Do the bar and supermassive black hole overlap or cross each other? Do the stars from the bar get sucked inside the supermassive black hole?  "
2141,Are there known objects rotating at close-to-light speeds?,"For example, [tex]? Is this actually possible?  Background: is that true that the black hole in the center of the Milky Way rotates once per 20 minutes? "
2142,Does science need support from religion or philosophy to explain the creation?,"Science is trying to explain how the universe is made. The beginning of the universe explains the Big Bang theory. But what happened before Big Bang? Science cannot go before that. So, does this mean that always there be space for religion and philosophy to explain things that science cannot? "
2143,Can things move faster than light inside the event horizon of a black hole?,"Black Holes are regions of space where things get weird [Citation Needed]. Past the event horizon of a black hole, any moving particle instantaneously experiences a gravitational acceleration towards the black hole that will cancel out it's current velocity, even light. That means that the gravity well of the black hole must be able to accelerate from -C¹ to 0 instantly². Given that fact, we can assume the gravitational acceleration of black holes is C/instant³. Given this, it stands to reason that in successive instants, the particle will be moving at speeds greater than C, because it is experiencing greater gravitational forces and continuous gravitational acceleration.  Does this actually make sense? Is there something I'm missing here? By this logic, it seems like anything inside of the event horizon of a black hole could and should move faster than C due to gravitational acceleration.   Edit: I showed this question to a friend and he questioned if the hypothetical particles that were radiating from the singularity (The photon traveling exactly away from the black hole) might be hawking radiation; that is, the gravitation acceleration of a black hole is only strong enough to curve the path of light around a non-zero radius (thus not actually stopping it, but altering it's course), and not powerful enough to decelerate light. Is this actually what hawking radiation is, or is he as confused as I am?    ¹ Where movement towards the singularity would be considered a positive value, movement away from the singularity is a negative value, that is, anything moving at the speed of light away from the singularity would be moving with a velocity of -C relative to the singularity.  ² If it couldn't accelerate from -C to 0 instantly, any photon traveling exactly away from the black hole would be able to escape the event horizon.  ³ An instant is an arbitrary amount of time, it could be a fraction of a second, a second, a minute.... "
2144,Is a swimming pool analogy to building of black holes in the centers of galaxies valid?,"In our garden, we have a little pool to enjoy our 2 children. It is 3 meters in diameter and contains some 4 m³ of water.  For cleaning-convenience every evening I go walking some 5 or 10 rounds in the pool all in the same direction, to set up a relatively fast rotating current in the pool. As a result, all of the remaining dirt (leaves, insects and seeds) are gathered together in the middle of the pool, where they can be easily removed.  So the analogy to galaxies is as follows:   The pool represents the galaxy.      The water represents the space-time? (or all we cannot see in a galaxy? Or the galaxy as a whole?) The dirt represents barionic matter which is forced to be dense in the center of the galaxy, hence building the super massive black hole.   It is clear that it is perhaps no good idea trying to map a 3m standup pool to a 100000 lightyear galaxy, but the observation seems to be worth a thought (and I do not think that I am the first one searching for analogies in that direction).  The question now is, could this be a valid analogy to the process of building supermassive black holes as a result of rotation? "
2145,How exactly can the hypothetical conformal invariance of the CMB spectrum be established by analyzing tensor modes?,"In the introduction of this paper at the top of p11, it is mentioned that a hypothetical enhancement of the scale invariance of the CMB spectrum to conformal invariance could potentially be established by analyzing the higher n-point functions of the tensor modes.  First of all, why are the tensor modes needed for this? Does conformal invariance not appear in the scalar modes? How does this work exactly (mathematically), how does conformal invariance (not just scale invariance...!) manifest itself in the n-point functions of the tensor modes?  Has this already been looked at or will it be done for the tensor modes in the BICEP2 data for example? "
2146,"Clarity on dust extinction terms and implementation: R_V, A_V, and E(B-V)","I have created a model galaxy spectrum using STARBURST99 and want to compare it to an observed spectrum of a particular galaxy. I understand that I need to redden my model spectrum to do this, so I am following the Cardelli et al. (1989) parameterization, which returns A(lambda)/A(V) for different wavelengths. I understand that the extinction correction in magnitudes is A_V, and I know that R_V = A_V/E(B-V). However I don't know how these terms relate to each other to apply them to my model spectrum (flux density).  I've read that the commonly adopted R_V value for the Milky Way is 3.1, but what is the E(B-V) value? If I want to apply extinction to a model galaxy for both the Milky Way AND the other galaxy's internal extinction, how would I go about this? For the external galaxy, I have a measured E(B-V) value to use (or does this only apply to the MW extinction?), but in this case I don't know what to use for R_V. "
2147,What else could the Event Horizon Telescope Observe?,"The Event Horizon Telescope was made possible in order to observe the details of supermassive black holes. This took a huge amount of work installing extra telescopes and developing the hardware and software needed to do VLBI at such short wavelengths. They have achieved spatial resolution around 25 micro arc seconds, comparable to the astrometric data from the Gaia space probe, but optimised for very different purposes.  So my question is what else could they usefully observe? What scientific targets have interesting detail at that angular scale and emit enough radiation at that wavelength to be observable? "
2148,Sun's apparent motion above the arctic circle during summer solstice,"I'm having difficulty with an apparent contradiction about the sun's motion during the summer solstice above the arctic circle.  The YouTube video The North Pole Entire Summer of never ending sun Summer Solstice High speed camera and solar motion models show the sun to move clockwise around the horizon for the full 360 degrees during the summer solstice. However, when I walk in a circle counterclockwise, to represent the earth's rotation, and focus upon a fixed object outside the circle to represent the sun, I get a 180 degree motion, from ""east to west"", and then the sun's apparent motion returns again from west to east, not the full 360 degrees which everyone reports is the actual phenomenon.    Can someone help me to understand my dilemma?   "
2149,What do the lines in this Event Horizon Telescope and Global mm-VLBI Array infographic represent?,"In the following EHT and GMVA diagram, what do the yellow and blue lines represent?

2150,Do most planetary systems have fewer planets than the solar system?,"It is my impression that most planetary systems have, at most, three to four planets. Is that real? Or is it just that we lack the ability to detect most planets? "
2151,What does it mean when we say that information is potentially recoverable from a black hole,"My understanding is that if the surface of a black hole is holographic, then information is potentially emitted from a black hole, say due to Hawking radiation or some other means.   What can say about this information?  Is it physically possible and/or feasible that this type of emission would embed information about what went into it?  Also, how does this measure up against the idea that the world lines inside the event horizon are completely disconnected from the outside?  I have some knowledge of the information paradox, but I was really hoping someone could  explain it in simple terms or point me to a prior explanation along those lines. "
2152,Do gravitational waves have distinct bands or parameters from which a source redshift can be inferred?,"In optical astronomy, much (most?) electromagnetic radiation is emitted at well defined frequencies, and this can be used to infer a redshift for the source, and hence its recessional velocity, age, or distance.  I haven't read anything specifically suggesting well defined source frequencies for gravitational wave astronomy, which would allow a redshift to be calculated the same way. I assume there would be a redshift effect since like EM radiation a gravitational wave propagates at (or exceedingly close to) the speed of light. But then again it propagates as a ripple in spacetime rather than a phenomenon embedded in spacetime, so perhaps not.   Do gravitational waves exhibit a frequency shifting effect akin to a redshirt, due to cosmic expansion, and which can be used to infer distance/time?  If so, do they also exhibit some kind of discreet originating frequencies, or some way that we can infer their originating frequencies, to compare the received signal and deduce the amount of redshifting they have undergone?  "
2153,Inability of Hubble to clearly resolve nearby celestial objects,"The Hubble space telescope performs incredibly detailed and stunning imaging of celestial bodies that are many, many light years away, and yet when it attempts to image objects within our own Solar System, such as of Pluto and Charon, the results appear out of focus and smeared. Why is this so?  I can only guess that the objects within the Solar System have a higher relative intrinsic motion than objects light years away, and thus Hubble can't track them so precisely? Or maybe Hubble's optics are ""fixed"" at an ""infinity point"" beyond ""nearby"" objects? Or...? "
2154,stellar metallicity,"I saw a talk recently mentioning that another factor that may determine a star's metallicity (besides age) may be how far from the center of its ""birth cluster"" it is when the short lived hot central stars of the cluster go supernova. I wonder if someone could comment on this. I also wonder if, since now we have better data, have we found more of a continuum of metallicities or is the ""Population I, Population II, Population III"" idea still going strong?? "
2155,What is a Seyfert galaxy?,"I know Seyfert galaxies are types of active galaxies, but I do not understand what separates them from other types of active galaxies.  Are they brighter/not as bright as other types of active galaxies?  Do they emit in different wavelengths relative to other active galaxies?  I've read that 10% of all galaxies are Seyfert galaxies, so it seems to me that understanding what these galaxies are is very important to understanding galaxies overall. "
2156,Say we were to bring Titan to Earth's orbit. How much would its atmospheric pressure change?,"I've heard one of the reason why Titan has such a thick atmosphere is because of its really low temperature. So say that were were to magically bring Titan to the Same orbit as Earth, and the moon starts to rapidly heating up. How much of its atmosphere would it lose? Would we still be able to stand there without a pressurized suit? Is it possible to terraform Titan to the extent that we can heat up its surface while still retaining its thick atmosphere?   Thanks  "
2157,"Could non-supernova carbon, oxygen, or silicon flashes be observed?","I was reading about the helium flash, the short but sudden onset of helium fusion in certain red giant stars. As I understand, the upper (nondegenerate) layers of the star absorb the energy as they quickly expand, which leads to the stabilization of the core as thermal pressure takes over, leading to the period of helium burning.  I was curious as to whether this could be generalized to the onset of fusion of heavier elements later in a more massive star's life, and I came across a reference to a hypothetical silicon flash in Woosley &amp; Heger (2015). More digging led me to a passage in Fundamental Astronomy (page 250), which states     In stars with masses around 10 [tex] either carbon or oxygen may be ignited explosively just like helium in relatively low-mass stars; there is a carbon or oxygen flash. This is much more powerful than the helium flash, and may make the star explode as a supernova.   Let's say that a star undergoes a relatively low-power carbon, oxygen, or silicon flash, and enough energy is absorbed by the outer layers such that the star does not undergo a supernova. Would enough energy escape the outer layers of the star so that we be able to detect the flash using optical or neutrino telescopes? Obviously, this is distance-dependent, so I'll say that the hypothetical star is within five parsecs of Earth.  As another way to put the question, how luminous would the flash be? "
2158,"Could this be a cosmic ray hit on my cameras sensor (CMOS, DSLR)?","While taking pictures of the bubble nebula I noticed a very strange artifact on only one of my pictures. It can't be a satellite since its not a straight line and this is a 90s exposure that should make a line much longer. Also I doubt this is just readout noise from the camera (image is unstretched, unedited) since hot pixels don't form lines. So could this be a cosmic ray hit?

2159,Real-time position of a distant celestial body,"How might it be possible to determine (via some specific online empemeris or via some well-understood algorithm) the observed position of some distant celestial body (e.g. Betelgeuse)?  To be concrete: suppose I wished to do what any number of mobile phone applications do, i.e. computationally model the observed position of stars and project them onto the screen using GPS coordinates and compass direction, so that an `overlay' of the night sky is produced. Then:  a) Where could I source the relevant data from?  b) What coordinate system would it be best to use? "
2160,Reason for a correlation between Hot Jupiters and higher metallicity in Kepler data,"This question is from an amateur data analysis I did in May of data from Kepler.nasa.gov/Mission/discoveries. There were 80 Jupiter size planets in the Kepler ""confirmed"" planet table on this website (thru 4/1/15) that had host stars with metallicity data. Of these, 24 stars have [Fe/H}>0.2 and 40 have -0.1&lt;[Fe/H]&lt;+0.2. This is a much higher percentage than the sample as a whole. Would this be strong evidence that high metallicity measurements are due to accretion? Or, do the metallicity measurements given reflect abundance deeper into the star than accretion can count for (ie. higher metallicity stars are more likely to have Jupiters in general)? "
2161,Can mechanical angular momentum be transferred by gravity?,"At PSE there are a few answers that explain that since the moon is responsible for tides and tides slow down spinning, L must be transferred to the moon.  This implies that if earth's L were reduced by an asteroid, this would not influence the moon's orbit.  Can you  clarify:   does the change of [tex] of the Earth alter the orbit of moon only when that change is attributable to the moon or in any case? would there be tides if there were no moon? what is the mechanism through which angular momenta can exchange magnitude? This is apparently impossible since there is no connection or, we we consider the obsolete Netwonian gravity, the connection is radial and never tangential?  "
2162,How do scientists determine if a star's color is due to Doppler shift vs the star's composition vs temperature?,"When looking at visible light coming from, say a star, scientists can determine by the shifting of the light towards the red or the blue end of the spectrum to determine if it is moving towards or away from earth. But they can also look at the light as it falls on the visible spectrum to determine the composition of said star. How do they determine if the light landing on the red end of the spectrum, for example, means it's moving away vs the composition of the star? How do they tell the difference?   In addition, how is all this reconciled with the fact that a star's color is also based on it's temperature?  Note: Question was expanded to include temperature after comments and updated answer subsequent to my original question asking only about motion vs composition. "
2163,Could celestial coordinates be encoded into three-word combinations?,"I came across this cool tool which encodes geographic coordinates into 3 dictionary words - table.lamp.chair - for example. You can see their map here [website]It made me curious as to whether this sort of thing could work for communicating the locations of stars.  It would be pretty simple to assign unique three-word addresses to stars in stellar databases. What would be even more powerful is if we could encode celestial coordinates into three-word addresses, and create an interactive ""what3words"" space map. But would this be at all useful?  The finite surface area of the earth allows us to create the grid of 57 trillion squares. Can we work with the infinite nature of the celestial sphere to create something similar? "
2164,What was the age of the universe when the average density was one atmosphere?,How long did it take after the Big Bang for the average density of the universe to reach one Earth atmosphere at sea level? How about the density of water? Is there a chart of densities that relate to everyday objects (so easier to understand)? 
2165,Do far away stars that we observe today still exist?,"I don't know much about the astronomy or the universe but enjoy reading articles from time to time as they pop up. Just finished reading an article on CNN that discussed how a South African telescope has discovered hundreds of galaxies, some 200 million light years away.  This got me thinking: Are these galaxies and or some of their stars we see in telescopes still there? Let's say STAR X is confirmed to be 200 million light years away. What if it completely exploded 1 million years ago? Wouldn't we need to wait 199 million years before we could detect that?  "
2166,The Moon drifting away from the Earth,"wiki says that average distance from earth increases 3.8 cm per year, can you tell how much of that is due to the expansion of the universe?  wiki also says:     Through the action of tidal forces, angular momentum is slowly being   transferred from Earth's rotation to the Moon's orbit. The result is   that Earth's rate of spin is imperceptibly decreasing (at a rate of   2.3 milliseconds/century),[20] and the lunar orbit is gradually expanding.   Can you give some details about this process, is the orbit changing shape, eccentricity? is the average orbital speed decreasing, by what value? is the spin angular velocity increasing, by what value?  If I did not misunderstand it, the current view on tides says that tidal bulges exert a torque on the moon, and L is tranferred to it, if that is correct, that L being transferred to its spin is increasing or decreasing it? Can you clarify also how a torque on the spin can produce a change of the orbit, which only implies a change (a decrease, in fact) of its orbital speed and not of the spinning speed? Can the spin (L) influence the orbital L, and how?  edit   I asked specific questions, which are not asked or answered there. In particular I am asking: if as they say the tidal/equatorial bulge increases spin angular momentum, how is this transferresin its turn to the orbital angulat momentum? Or, alternatively  can gravity directly increase the orbital momentum of a satellite? Actually the answer, besides being incomplete, may be wrong because momentum/KE is not added , but subtracted to the moon, since its orbit gets larger. There can be no transfer, since both earth and moon are slowing down torque is not correctly explained  "
2167,What is the most asymmetric known planet?,"Planets are more or less spherical, can you tell which one is the most asymmetric? Do they figure out such a property from an eccentric behaviour, or what?  I have a simple technical question: an asymmetric body gets a torque in a gravitational field, is the rotational energy/acceleration to be subtracted from the regular energy/acceleration? In other words: does an asymmetric planet get less radial acceleration than a perfect spherical one? "
2168,Correlation of planet sizes with star sizes?,"I did my own amateur Kepler data analysis in May of this year of data from Kepler.nasa.gov/Mission/ discoveries. I found a strong correlation between star size and planet size (percentages). 37 of the 44 planets confirmed (84.1%) orbiting M dwarfs were less than 2.0 R(Earth) with only one hot Jupiter. 129 of 241 (53.6%) orbiting K dwarfs were less than 2.0 R(Earth) with 9 hot Jupiters (3.7%). 196 of 517 (37.9%) orbiting G dwarfs were less than 2.0 R(Earth) with 49 hot Jupiters (9.5%). 92 of 213 (43.2%) orbiting F dwarfs were less than 2.0 R(Earth) with 23 hot Jupiters (10.8%). I would like to know how much of this correlation is probably real and how much is biased by the limits of the study? Biases I am aware of are the fact that the Kepler study is primarily of systems with ""close in"" planets, (only 90 of 1015 confirmed as of 4/1/15 are over 0.3 AU) and that only 4.3% of the ""Kepler stars"" are M dwarfs. I also see biases that might arise from the methods of confirming the planets (Kepler stars from 110 to 405 had planets confirmed by the ""multiple candidate"" method). It also appears that there may be a greater difference between K and G star systems than between G and F. Where can I find a more professional analysis of this type? "
2169,First night on a telescope questions,"So I recently got into astronomy and I am using my fathers old Meade EQ1-B reflector telescope. This is my first night using it and I have come across a few questions. To begin, the telescope was left alone for several years (the scope is a fairly old model) and may have become damaged over time, yet nothing too severe. We were cleaning it and got to the mirror to find that over the years the ""mirror"" cover on top of the glass had chipped away all over, giving the result of a patchy look.   We were testing the scope out during the day and the image was fine - the mirror didn't affect it. Now, I am looking upon stars and have noticed a couple of things. When viewing these stars the image sort of moves, not the scope, the image. As if it were an animation, the star isn't just a white blob, it looks like the sun, where the blob is moving - as if it were a liquid. No I am not stupid enough to point the scope at the sun... during night time. The stars just move like a liquid in the center, is this an effect of the mirror? I can't see why it would be as the image was fine during daylight. Is this how all stars work? I haven't had a chance to point it at the moon or any other planets so I can't test it on an object that isn't a star.  Also, as the scope is a reflector it has the ""three lines"" on the front, however this interferes with the object I am looking at as i can see the lines on the star. Is there any way to stop this, or is it just the result of using a reflector?  Thanks!  Image below:  "
2170,How do isolated binary compact systems survive their formational supernovae?,"In a broad sense I'm trying to understand how a binary black hole or neutron star systems can form from isolated binary massive star systems (i.e., other than from migration within rich BH/NS clusters), and especially, how these can form within the constraints that allow for observed merger rates. I was hoping that this question would answer me, but it doesn't, because I realised I've never seen an explanation of how a binary system could survive a SN of one of its stars in the first place.  As far as I understand, we think one route to observed BH/NS mergers is a binary system of massive stars. This gives a scenario of 2 massive stars in an isolated binary system, one of which undergoes core collapse and type 2 SN. The two stars must be quite close (or later perturbed) and not greatly ""kicked"" on formation of either compact object, otherwise they couldn't later merge in the observed time. They probably also have similar ages (formed in the same cloud).  But in this scenario   How does the second-to-collapse star, survive being ripped apart by a nearby SN at such short distance, and remain in a small enough orbit, which we know happens since we later observe the merger of two compact objects? How does it survive structurally and regain stability in a form capable of future SN, given the intense flood of neutrinos and other energy/particles, some of which can penetrate to its core? Or does the first SN directly trigger the second SN? Even assuming the second star survives with enough mass and undisrupted structure for SN (or is triggered directly into SN), wouldn't the transferred momentum from the first SN ejecta ""on its doorstep"" be sufficient to simultaneously unbind the binary system, or the momentum transferred from the second SN be enough to eject the first NS/BH, so that the two resulting compact objects no longer form a binary system?  "
2171,How did pre-Earth's mass and orbit change at the Moon formation event?,"The popular, but still disputable, Moon formation theory is that a pre-Earth was hit by a Mars sized planet. The mass ratio of Earth:Mars:Moon is roughly 100:10:1.   Does this mean that pre-Earth was roughly 9 Moon masses (~10%) lighter than today's Earth? Or could much mass have been ejected from the Earth-Moon system? Did the impact substantially and immediately change Earth's orbit, such as its average distance from the Sun? Is there a better planet name for ""pre-Earth"", like there is for Theia? It was after all another planet than Earth is.  "
2172,Is this the Florence asteroid?,"  I saw this blazing thing in the sky from Chennai, India at around 21:00 IST. Is this by any chance the Florence asteroid ? If not, what is this ? I'm pretty sure that this cannot be a firecracker because it was huge with large flames and it actually lasted in sky for at least 30 seconds till it reached heights where commercial aircrafts fly.   NOTE: This object was moving from the ground and upwards towards the atmosphere. "
2173,Can stars be seen in the background when looking directly at our solar system?,"Imagine viewing the solar system from the outside:    Considering the sun is quite bright, would you still be able to see stars in the background, or does the sunlight disable us to do so?  Consider this photo:    Does the light from the sun disable us from seeing stars in the background or have they simply been removed in an editor after the fact of being taken (the photo)?  Obviously there needs be some way of seeing stars from space, since looking at photos from space stations (or even from Earth) those are full of stars.  But, viewing the solar system from above (from the outside), can you see stars in the background or does the sunlight simply block them out?  "
2174,collimating AstroMaster 114,"I've owned my AstroMaster 114EQ for about a year now, and feel like I know my way around pretty well, but I'm only just becoming aware that collimation is recommended. The user manual has instructions on basic collimation. Does this look sufficient? Or should I invest in a celestron 94183 collimation cap, a celestron collimation eyepiece, or something fancy like an Orion LaserMate Deluxe II? The telescope itself cost less than $200 so I can't help but wonder if the fancier collimators are overkill. I've watched this longish video and one must apparently perform some disassembly on the telescope to user the laser collimator. This doesn't seem like the easy 'couple of minutes' adjustment I've seen described.  I'm also confused about the process of adjusting the secondary mirror. If anyone has good instructions about my specific model, I would greatly appreciate it. I'd really like to get it tuned up now that Mars is looking so good. "
2175,Conflicting information about the star Delta Pavonis?,"Delta Pavonis has about the same mass as the sun so I would think that the evolutionary path would be about the same (the mass is given as O.991 M(Sun)/ not sure how we get this so accurately). It has been estimated to be about 6.6 to 6.9 Ga with a luminosity of 1.22 L(Sun). This all makes sense if you put it on the main sequence where we will be in a couple of billion years (after T(max) in about a billion years). The problem is that the surface temperature is only 5550K (spectral) and for this reason is thought to be in subgiant phase which isn't supposed to happen to us for about another 5.5 billion years. Delta Pav also has a very high metallicity [Fe/H] of +0.33 which also screams ""subgiant"". What am I missing?? (data from Wikipedia sources) "
2176,What is the real position of the tidal bulge?,"wiki has this picture of the tidal bulge:    but says that:     The average tidal bulge is synchronized with the Moon's orbit, and   Earth rotates under this tidal bulge in just over a day. However,   Earth's rotation drags the position of the tidal bulge ahead of the   position directly under the Moon. As a consequence, there exists a   substantial amount of mass in the bulge that is offset from the line   On the other hand, this academical article states the opposite:     as we move with respect to both tidal bulge and moon, the moon   crosses our meridian before we experience the highest tide.] How   early? Some books show misleading diagrams with the symmetry axis of   the tidal bulges making an angle of 30° or more with the moon. In   fact, the angle is only 3°, so the tides are late by about 24(3/360)60   = 12 minutes           through the centers of Earth and the Moon      Can you say what is the real position of the bulge? it is surely a hard fact not open to interpretations. Do you have access to sites that say where is now the moon and where is the tidal bulge?  According to the basic laws of conservation of momentum and energy, a mass moving to a greater radius should be slowed downm and if we add friction the lag of 12 minutes or more makes sense. If the highest point of the bulge is forward wrt to the vertical of the moon, can you explain what stronger force pushes the water in the direction of the spin?  I found this site that gives the position of sun and moon, but doesn't show tides   This animation, on the other hand, shows that there is no bulge  Thered areas experience a rise over 1 m, the blue one a depression of over 1 m:  "
2177,What wavelengths are used to search for distant solar system objects like KBOs and Oort cloud members?,"What wavelengths of light are used/most suited to search for distant solar system objects like KBOs and Oort cloud members?

2178,Does Big Bang red shift affect the frequency of both light waves and individual photons?,"With regard to the wave/particle duality of light, does Big Bang red shift affect both the frequency of light waves, and, the frequency of individual photons?

2181,How far would EGSY8p7 be away now?,"Apparently EGSY8p7 is the object with the longest light travel distance, 13.2 gly or a redshift of z = 8.68 (Wikipedia).  So the light took 13.2 billion years to travel to us from that object, but we know that the universe has expanded since (I believe with an expansion rate that varied over time). So given our current theories of how the universe expanded, is it possible to calculate the theoretical distance of that object to us right now?   I assume it must be close to what is believed the radius of the observable universe (46.5 Gly) but how would one go about to calculate this?  "
2182,Questions about time and space (from beginner),"To be honest my knowledge about astronomy and related physics is close to zero. However, since I studied math a bit, I would like to ask a couple maybe stupid questions, which I am curious about and I don't know who and where to ask.  A) Projection of life  Premises:  As Carl Sagan explained in his ""flatlanders"" story, we can imagine high-dimension space by making projections into space with lower dimension.  As we learned at elementary school time is the fourth dimension.  Question:  Is it right that what we see/feel in every moment is projection of some 4D reality into our 3D world noticed by our senses.  For example, If my eyes were able to ""somehow"" see in 4D and I pointed my eyes to a person, would I see that person in all stages of his/her life from birth to death as a single ""entity""? In every second we are only a projection of our 4D representation to our 3D world?   B) Parallel realities  Premises:     If we imagine 1D space as a line without ends, 2D space as an unbounded plane and 3D space as an unbounded space, then I could put infinity number of parallel lines into 2D space and infinity number of parallel planes to the 3D space.  I have read that there are at least 10 dimensions.  Questions:  Can I put infinite number of 3D spaces into a single 4D space? If yes, then if we for example chose geographic coordinates of Earth-Italy-Caesena as place and 49 B.C. as time coordinate, we would be probably close to event when Caesar screamed his famous: ""alea iacta est"".   If we considered that 5th dimension exists and that we could put infinite number of 4D spaces into 5D space, then we would end up with infinite number of parallel realities, in which Caesar did not crossed Rubicon, or did not even exist. Is it right or complete nonsense? Can be somehow proved that this is right/nonsense? "

2184,Are galaxies expanding away from us at more than the speed of light?,"If you go to the following video, at this certain time:  [website]you will see that the narrator says:     ""We simply don't know what else is out there because the light from these incredibly distant places has not yet had enough time in the universes history to reach us yet back on Earth. And the light from some places might never reach us at all. Because some parts of space, very far from Earth, are expanding away from us, faster then the speed of light, that means that the light from these places will never, in an infinite amount of time reach Earth""    Am I understanding this correctly? Some parts in the universe are expanding faster then the speed of light? Is it yet proven that there are definitely things faster then the speed of light?  I feel like I am misunderstanding the above statement.  P.S, try watching the entire video, it will be 10 minutes well spent. "
2185,How can a supermassive black hole cause so much energy to enlighten its matter when its massive gravity prevents light to escape?,"To cite the German newpaper article Astronomen beobachten erwachendes Schwarzes Loch:     Das Materie-Monster sitzt den Angaben zufolge im Herzen der 42 Millionen Lichtjahre entfernten Polarring-Galaxie NGC 660, deren Aktivität innerhalb weniger Monate Hunderte Male zugenommen hatte.       Erst wenn die Massemonster große Mengen Materie verschlucken, werden sie aktiv. Bei diesem Prozess wird so viel Energie frei, dass die Materie hell aufleuchtet, bevor sie im Schwarzen Loch verschwindet und ein Teil von ihr in Form von Jets weit ins Weltall hinaus geschleudert wird.   This translates roughly to:     According to the data the matter-monster is in the middle of the 42 million light years far away polar ring galaxy NGC 660, whose activity has increased a lot in only a few months.      Only when these Matter-monsters swallow big amounts of matter, they become active. This process releases so much energy, that it brightly enlightens the matter, before it disappears inside the black hole. A part of the matter is flung out in the universe in the form of jets.   My physics teacher told me once, that a black hole is just a very small-sized and heavy object which has so much gravity that nothing at all, not even light can't escape of its gravity. This explanation is also supported by this SE.astronomy - If nothing travels at the speed of light, except light, how can a black hole also pull light into itself? question.   If a ""normal"" (not supermassive) black hole can already prevent light to escape, how can matter which is pulled into the black hole can produce energy/light which can't escape the gravity of the black hole? How can a supermassive black hole be able to pull matter, but not the light photons of the energy? Additionally: Why is part of the matter which is pulled into the black hole flung (i.e. accelerated) into the universe? I understand why this matter is maybe divided - the acceleration increases as far as i know quadratic, i.e. the differences in terms of the actual acceleration, in dependence of the location may be so huge that the matter can't be held together. But i don't understand why a part of the matter is accelerated in the exact opposite direction, as a force bigger as the gravity of the supermassive black hole would be needed. Therefore: Why is a part of the matter accelerated in the opposite direction (i.e. out of the black hole's gravity) than the other part?     Note: My physics education is rather limited. I know a bit about the Newtonian gravity and a bit about the theory of Conservation of energy. But that's all I know about physics. "
2186,Were parts of the Universe deflating during Inflation?,"I was reading about the history of the early universe in Carroll &amp; Ostlie and specifically looking at Inflation, which, as I understand, occurred because our [observable] part of the universe entered a false vacuum state containing negative pressures, thus fueling expansion. (Carroll &amp; Ostlie state the opposite, but as per the discussion below, that appears to be incorrect).   Does that mean that there are other parts of the Universe (outside of our horizon) that experienced deflation, as inflationary parts pressed against them? Would there be boundaries between separate parts of the larger universe where inflationary parts encounter one another? Any thoughts on what those parts of the Universe are like, such as containing their own CMB that's NOT close to uniform, or where there is a much higher density of matter? "
2187,Why you use log to measure metallicity in galaxies?,"For example, I saw the next expression for matallicity in a paper: [tex].  I understand O/H is the O(Oxygen) to H(Hydrogen) ratio but why is there the number 12? And why the logarithm? "

Further, how many minutes per hour and seconds per minute should we have to avoid a leap second? "

I am not looking for a quick formula that let's me calculate this bur rather understand the components :) "
2190,Black Hole / Hawking Radiation: Why only capture anti-particle?,"I may have some specifics wrong here.  If so, don't focus on those.  Just focus on the general thrust of my question.  I ""understand"" (cough) that particle/anti-particle pairs form spontaneously in space.  I understand that they can form near the event horizon of a black hole, and that one particle can fall in, where as the other particle can barely escape.  I understand that an anti-particle will annihilate with a particle.  What I don't understand is why only the anti-particles of these virtual particle pairs fall into the black hole, while the other ones just manage to escape.  Shouldn't both particle and anti-particle have equal chance to be the one to fall in, or just manage to escape?  It seems that there should be an equal chance of either the particle, or the anti-particle, would be captured while the other ""ejected.""  So it seems that the black hole should be somewhat steady-state as far as mass change with respect to virtual particles.  Explain? "
2191,Does Eddington's variable polytropic index better fit data from the Standard Solar Model?,"I came across a 1938 paper by Arthur Eddington1 in which he discusses stellar polytropic models where the polytropic index [tex] varies inside the star, decreasing from a value [tex] at the surface to a value [tex] at the center. He specifically mentions that the case of [tex] and [tex] should represent ""ordinary gaseous stars"" quite well.  In his conclusion, he states     We have seen that actual stars are likely to be represented by a model with [tex] continually increasing outwards.   78 years later, we have better data about the structure of the Sun, thanks in part to helioseismology. So I have two questions:   Do researchers use Eddington's variable index treatment in theoretical models? Does Eddington's model better fit current data from the Sun than the standard polytropic model with [tex] constant throughout the star?   I ask partly because I know that the standard polytropic model (with [tex]) begins to fail in the outer regions of a star, thanks in part to convection, as shown below, and I wondered if even a simple two-phase model could suitably describe a convective envelope.    Graphs from this page.    1 Eddington mentions earlier work by Milne (1932), who uses a slightly more complex analysis. I haven't yet read Milne's paper, so I'm not familiar with its conclusions and use. "
2192,"Roll, Pitch and Yaw of Orbital Planes","I have been reading about celestial mechanics and particularly about planetary orbits. I understand that a planet's orbit can be tilted (pitched) with respect to the Earth's ecliptic and that it might precess (yaw) over time. But I have not come across any indication that another planet's orbital plane might be rolled with respect to the Earth's.  I have also found references to Keplerian orbital elements, but I don't see that any of them indicate roll. Am I misunderstanding the situation? If not, would someone point me at an elementary resource where I can learn about this? "
2193,Why is the solar system often shown as a 2D plane?,"Whenever I have learned about the solar system I always see the orbits displayed as a virtually flat plane.    Are all of the orbits in the solar system really like this? If so, why? It seems like a rather large coincidence for all of our planets + the asteroid belt to be on virtually the same plane.  "
2194,Astrophotography - Unable to achieve focus with current setup,"I am new to astrophotography and am looking for guidance. I have the following equipment:   Orion StarBlast 9814 4.5"" Altazimuth Reflector Tabletop telescope 1.25in Telescope Adapter Extension Tube T Ring for Canon DSLR SLR Camera DC618 17mm and 6mm lenses   When I use the lenses in the Telescope Adapter Extension, focus is not achievable. My theory is that the focal plane of most DSLR are 55mm back focus plane. Reflectors are positioned farther back than where the human eye would normally be placed, and hence it is usually difficult if not impossible to bring the camera into focus.  Is this true? Also, would a Barlow lens help achieve focus or be a waste of money? Any other suggestions? "

2196,Do far away planets reflect light in the same way our moon/earth reflects light?,"Here’s a scenario:  Say you’re up in space and you’re far enough way that you can see the planet earth. Whilst looking down, you can see  blue sky, blue water and green land and white clouds and darker shades of different colors. This is because our sun is reflecting light off our planet that we can see these colors.   Now you’re up in space and you’re far enough way that you can see the planet Jupiter. If you looked, would you be able to see colors in the same way we’ve seen from Juno’s pictures. I see red, white, orange… The sun is so much further away, how can the colors we see be just as bright/visible to us? The same question holds true for planets outside our solar system. They’re so far way from there light source, yet I can see colors on them. How come the distance of the light source doesn’t affect the brightness of the colors I see on these planets?   Like if I was to turn on a light bulb in a huge dark room and shine that light in the middle, the surrounding areas would be much brighter than the furthest point of that room/and at some point there would be no light reaching an even further point.   Bear in mind I’m a basic idiot when it comes to this stuff.  "
2197,nodal precession: earth's orbit of sun,"Does the Earth's orbit around the sun exhibit nodal precession, as does the moon's around the Earth?  If it does, that must mean that the ecliptic is in a periodic wobble with respect to the celestial sphere? "
2198,"When a neutron star accretes matter, will its mass increase?","When a nova gets matter, the outcome is that it may lose more matter because of eruptions. Only some kind of nova's masses can increase stably.   A white dwarf may become a supernova after it exceeds the Chandrasekhar limit, and we study that much. A neutron star can get mass too, why do not we talk about their end much?  How about a neutron star when it gets matter from accretion? It is necessary that its mass will increase?  When will it collapse? "
2199,Maximum Amplitude of a Lissajous Orbiting Object in a L4 or L5 Position,"I stumbled on The Lagrangian points during some wikipedia reading.  After looking at the gravity contours, I naturally come to the conclusion that the L4 &amp; L5 should have a wave pattern and then found the Lissajous orbit page.  It states:     Orbits about Lagrangian points L4 and L5 are dynamically stable in theory so long as the ratio of the masses of the two main objects is greater than about 25, meaning the natural dynamics keep the [third object] in the vicinity of the Lagrangian point even when slightly perturbed from equilibrium.   After reading it I started to wonder if there is a maximum possible amplitude (height of the peaks and troughs relative to the orbital plane of the second object) of the pattern?  Also, if there theoretically is none, for cases where it is extremely large, say larger than the 2 times the radius of the second orbiting object, what would the respective object weight ratios have to be to keep such a perturbed orbit stable for any realistic period of time?  FYI, I'm a computer scientist who loves reading about physical cosmology but can be kinda a noob sometimes. Please forgive me if I'm asking for the wrong parameters.  Edit: Here is an animation of 2010 TK7, Earth's first trojan asteroid, showing the wave pattern I'm referring to. Recall that my question is referring to the height of the peaks and troughs relative to Earth's orbital plane. Since the video is a top-down view, the peaks and troughs are going into and out of the screen. "
2200,Why is iron responsible for causing a supernova?,"Why is the element iron responsible for supernova? Can any star create more element than iron within the span of its life?  I understand that when star dies due to supernova, other elements are created (Gold and other 92 elements) due to more heat generated than required not only for fusion of Iron element but also for the fusion of higher element with each other.

2201,What would be the required conditions for a lunar eclipse to occur only once on a precise annual basis?,"As I am aware, lunar eclipses can take place several times a year on Earth. However, I am curious whether it would be possible for this event to only occur once annually on a specific date (and preferably on the same face of the planet) if the moon's angular orbit around Earth were to be altered from 5°.  To put it bluntly: How would the components causing a lunar eclipse need to be altered for a singular 'blood moon' to be able to appear reliably every year on say the 25th of September? If it is at all possible. Additionally, would these alterations cause any other significant effects between the Earth and Moon? "
2202,"Why is Mars considered the outer edge of the ""goldilocks zone""?","In both books and documentaries I often see the Goldilocks Zone as described between Venus and Mars with the Earth ""just right."" This seems sort of ill thought out to me, because it assumes that Venus' atmosphere comes from its distance from the sun and the same with Mars. I'm not too familiar with current ideas about how Venus' atmosphere formed, but with Mars I'm fairly sure it's widely understood the reason the atmosphere is so small is because the gravity is so weak. Even some discussions about terra forming Mars mention that within a few million years, perhaps, the atmosphere would drift off into space.  So how can we be so certain that's the limits of the zones, especially with Mars? If Mars was as large as Earth/Venus and could hold on to a thicker atmosphere and thus retain more heat, then wouldn't that automatically push out the Goldilocks Zone? It seems like the edges have been places arbitrarily without consideration as to why they're the edges instead of ""they just are."" This comes up especially because even with its weak atmosphere, at the equator, it can reach up to 20 degrees which is well within the realm of liquid water. "
2203,"Where exactly does the Moon flip, given that it appears the other way up in the other hemisphere?","I've read in multiple sources that the Moon appears the other way up in Northern Hemisphere vs Southern Hemisphere. Here is one that explains why: Does the Moon look different in the northern and southern hemispheres?  My question is, where is the line drawn in this case where the moon 'flips'? Is it exactly the equator? I'm not sure if it is, the simple 'thought experiment' in the above link assumes (for simplicity's sake) that the orbit of the Moon is exactly above the equator. According to Wikipedia, the orbit of the Moon is slightly tilted, and our own earth also tilts from time to time. Where does the moon flip exactly? Does it change throughout the year as our earth change its tilt? If so, how? Which are the areas that always see the northern look or the southern one throughout the year? "

2205,What is a singularity? What is at the center of a black hole? Specifically regarding space-time,"So because I can only really think of space-time in 2-dimensions like a sheet of something, my assumptions might be wrong to begin with. I was watching a YouTube video on black-holes and there was a quip regarding black holes and their warping of space time, to the point where the narrator said something along the lines of “there is nothing at the center of the black hole but gravity has warped space time so much that it's this ’pinhole’ like affect that causes the blackhole behavior”.  My questions are:   When a star dies and collapses into a black hole, what is at its center? The star's mass compacted into the size of the plank length, or something similarly small? Is there really nothing at the center of a black hole? Surely, the core collapsed into something really small right? What is meant by singularity? Is it just the warping of space-time that makes it this way?  "

However, EM-L2 spends most of its time in direct sunlight because the Earth-Moon line rarely coincides with the Sun-Earth line.

Still I can't figure out the geometry that would produce an ""eclipse"" (in this case the moon passing behind the larger asteroid) with it disappearing so ""far"" from the asteroid.

2213,Putting mass-luminosity relation and Hertzsprung-Russel diagrams together leads us to a mass-age relation; so how do stars lose their mass over time?,"I think that the title is completely clear, but here's an expansion:  I was just reading about Mass-luminosity relation that says massive stars are more luminous than tiny ones. Well, let's talk about main-sequence stars for now. This relation becomes interesting when it's mixed with the Hertzsprung-Russel diagram that says young stars are more luminous than older ones (Originally says that hotter stars are more luminous and we know that hotter stars are younger).  So mixing these two relations produces some kind of Mass-age relation which says young stars are more massive, that is a star loses its mass over time, right? (Please tell me if I'm going wrong)  If this Mass-age relation is right, how do stars lose this extra mass during their evolution? And where does this stray matter go? "

2215,Do bigger telescopes equal better results?,"There are many large reflecting/optical telescopes around the world, just to name a few: the Very Large Telescope, Large Zenith Telescope, and European Extremely Large Telescope.  My question is does actually building larger telescopes improve visibility of the universe, quality of an image, and various other attributes of a telescope?   Well it does seem kind of obvious that a larger telescope may have more magnification and better imaging, however if that is true than why don't we just build a super large one (think really really big, unlike the size of the current large ones) so we can see the universe in HD - so to speak?  Since we haven't done this yet (I think) is it because of financial issues or is it because simply building a bigger telescope won't improve much to visibility and image quality? "

2217,Universe Sandbox 2 accurate representation of gravity,"I've been playing Universe Sandbox for a while now and I have never been able to make a near Earth asteroid collide with it. By ""make"" I mean, simulating billions of years of known, near Earth objects until one of their orbits intersect. In this explanation Sir Cumference describes that Universe Sandbox 2 uses Newtonian physics to in its simulations. But wouldn't that calculate enough pull from Earth to slightly change the trajectory of the NEO to eventually impact?  We know, with almost 100% certainty that a LARGE NEO will impact Earth (probably sooner than later), otherwise why would we be investing so heavily on the Jet Propulsion Lab's Asteroid Watch program.   Can the game not accurately simulate gravitational pull on those large scales or is there something else (probably a lot) I'm missing? Are all known NEOs not projected to have a relevant collision intersection with Earth? "
2218,Venus presents same face toward Earth at closest approach. What do you make of that?,"Is reference 6 in this Wikipedia article ""dubious"" and this passage in need of excising or clarifying?     Venus's 583.92-day interval between successive close approaches to Earth is equal to 5.001444 Venusian [sic] solar days, making approximately the same face visible from Earth at each close approach. Whether this relationship arose by chance or is the result of some kind of tidal locking with Earth is unknown.   Gold T., Soter S. (1969), Atmospheric tides and the resonant rotation of Venus, Icarus, v. 11, p 356-366  Is it still an ""unknown"" or ""crazy idea that didn't develop with further investigation""?  The idea that Venus is tidally locked with Earth sounds far-fetched. We understand the slowing of Earth's rotation, and I don't recall ever reading of Venus's resistance to the change! "
2219,"What produces gravitational waves with ""periods between about 100 - 8000 seconds""?","The Ulysses mission has a compelling story. I was sent to Jupiter to perform a gravitational assist shooting it out of the plane of the ecliptic in order to fly over the Sun's north and south poles to perform ""fast latitude scans"". Because of its design it was used for several important lines of scientific study.  Ulysses contained a pair of coherent transponders which received signals from Earth, shifted them in frequency in a coherent way using phase-locked loops and beamed them immediately back to Earth at two different frequencies.  From ESA's write up of the Ulysses Gravitational Wave Experiment:     In the spacecraft Doppler tracking method, the Earth and spacecraft constitute the two objects whose time-varying separation is monitored to detect a passing gravitational wave. The monitoring is accomplished with high-precision Doppler tracking in which a constant frequency microwave radio signal (S-band) is transmitted from the Earth to the spacecraft (uplink); the signal is transponded (received and coherently amplified) at the spacecraft; and then transmitted back to Earth (downlink) in both S- and X-band signals. This Dual frequency downlink is required in order to calibrate the interplanetary media which affects the two frequency bands differently. The downlink signal is recorded at Earth and its frequency is compared to the constant uplink frequency f0 to extract the Doppler signal, δf / f0.   The article goes on to say:     Since the optimum size of a gravitational wave detector is the wave length, interplanetary dimensions are needed for detecting gravitational waves in the mHz range. Doppler tracking of Ulysses provides sensitive detections of gravitational waves in this low frequency band. The driving noise source is the fluctuations in the refractive index of interplanetary plasma. This dictates the timing of the experiment to be near solar opposition and sets the target accuracy for the fractional frequency change at 3.0 × 10-14 for integration times of the order of 1000 seconds.      SUMMARY OF OBJECTIVES      The objective of the gravitational wave investigation on Ulysses is to search for low frequency gravitational waves crossing the Solar System. Because of the great distance to the spacecraft, this method is most sensitive to wave periods between about 100 - 8000 seconds, a band which is not accessible to ground-based experiments which are superior for periods below 1 second.

A slow continuous dimming by about 0.3% a year has been identified recently. But all anomalies I know of come from the Kepler space telescope. It is an F3-star at 1500 ly distance. Shouldn't it be easy to observe its light curve with even relatively modestly sized ground based telescopes? Have such observations been done and have they confirmed any anomalies? You see, I suspect something weird went wrong with the Kepler telescope here.  EDIT: There have been studies of its brightness on archived historic photographs. But I'm more interested in observations simultaneous as Kepler or since then, to confirm either a gradual dimming or short deep dips. "

2225,Is a General Relativity approximation available in Universe Sandbox (1 or 2)?,"This answer points out that including General Relativity in a simulation can be computationally intensive and may not be present in Universe Sandbox.  However, answers to How to calculate the planets and moons beyond Newtons's gravitational force? discuss approximations that go most of the way toward including main GR effects in a typical solar system simulation where the effects are small.

And to double check, is it absolutely certain that only Newtonian mechanics is used currently for propagating orbits? "
2226,"Radiative Flux, Irradiance and Luminosity confusion","First of all I know there is a similar question here, but I feel is wasn't answered at all.  My question is that I have seen many texts which says that Radiative Flux is equal to the Irradiance of a star. In Carroll &amp; Ostlie book ""An Introduction to Modern Astrophysics"" even say that:        And Wikipedia's Irradiance on Earth's surface says this:     Average annual solar radiation arriving at the top of the Earth's atmosphere is roughly 1361 W/m².   Following this I first I assume that Irradiance and Radiative Flux are the same thing, but when searching for Irradiance on Wikipedia says that:     In radiometry, irradiance is the radiant flux (power) received by a surface per unit area.   Which means that Irradiance is Flux divided by Area, so Radiant Flux has units of J/s and Irradiance has units of W m^-2 which I remember from my Optics class, then again Carroll &amp; Ostlie say that:        That doesn't mean if Irradiance is equal to Radiant Flux divided by Area, so F = I*A that would make Irradiance equal Luminosity / Area^2 ? In that case the bolometric magnitude should be calculated with the integral of Irradiance, not Luminosity nor Flux right?  Probably I'm making it complicated for myself and it's not that hard to understand. I'm just sharing my confusion with you guys, please help me with that question.  Thanks in advance. "

2229,Basis of color index,"As an amateur astronomer for 60 years and always as interested in the science as in the observing, I thought I had a pretty good understanding of the fundamentals. But I'm distance-auditing a third-year course in the fundamentals of applied astronomy, and I found that I had a misconception about the color index.   I had assumed the CI was derived by measuring the star's own magnitude in each of, say, the B and V passbands, then subtracting to get the CI (e.g., by taking the ratio of flux intensities, expressed as a magnitude).  Not so! It's derived by measuring the star's magnitude relative to standard zero points (the magnitude of Vega at each of those wavelengths) that are defined to be magnitude 0 for those wavelength, then subtracting to get the CI.  My question is: Why measure two fluxes relative to a standard and then compare those two values, rather than simply measuring them relative to each other? Why not just measure the flux at each wavelength, take the ratio, express this as a magnitude, and use that as the CI? The relationships are the same either way, just with a different zero point (think 0K and -273°C). It seems like finding how far apart Cleveland and Chicago are by measuring the distance of each from NYC and subtracting, rather than just measuring the distance between them. I don't see that the convention accomplishes anything other than assigning a CI of 0 to ""neutral"" white stars. Or am I missing something? "

2234,Weird Blob near Polaris?,"I need help identifying a blob.   Last night I took a picture of Polaris, and there is a weird blob in it that I can't identify.  Star charts and other pictures on the 'net do not show this blob.  I took three pictures (with slightly different positions) and the blob has the same shape and position (relative to Polaris) in each.  The blob does not exist in other pictures that I took (pointing in completely different directions).  Taken with a Canon t5i, 300mm lens, 3 minute exposure on a motorized equitorial mount.  Viewing conditions were terrible, with lots-o-moon and smoke from forest fires.  From Colorado.  Polaris is the brightest star, slightly left and down from center.  Yildun, the next star in the handle of the little dipper, is near the upper left corner.  The blob in question is very near, and slightly up and to the left of Polaris.  Thoughts?  Speculations?  Edit:  Simple Lens Flare:  I don't think it's lens flare (LF).  With LF, you can draw a straight line through the photo where the flare, the bright object, and the center of the photo all line up. Also, the LF tends to match the shape of the bright object.  I don't think it's LF because the blob doesn't line up with the center of the photo and a bright object, and there are no bright objects that have the same shape as the blob (with that weird tail to it).  Also, I have three photos with the same blob. In each case, Polaris (the brightest point in the photo) moves slightly because the camera moved slightly but the blob moves exactly with Polaris and not somehow relative with the center of the frame.    Under careful analysis, there IS lens flare, but it is where you'd expect it and not where the blob is. If you draw a line though Polaris and the center of the frame, there is a flare on the opposite side of the center and the same distance away from the center as Polaris is.  Schmutz in the camera:  I don't think it's dust/dirt in the camera/sensor.  If that were the case then I would have seen it in other photos from the night, and I didn't.  Also, the blob would have stayed in the same position in the frame and not moved with Polaris as it did in the 3 different photos that I have of it.  Not-So-Simple Lens Flare:  Maybe.  Although I cant imagine how this would happen unless some lens elements were not radially-symmetric and/or elements were not lined up on a common axis.  But I don't know everything about camera design so maybe this is possible?  There's a new blob in the sky:  Possible.  Although I think the odds of ""user error"" are much higher.  Maybe someone else wants to take a new photo of Polaris?  (wishful thinking)   "
2235,What is the actual black hole merger speed?,"I have seen models of 2 black hole mergers.     [website]When we see a space ship appear to be frozen in time as it approaches the event horizon then would a back hole merger be faster then perceived in our time?   John put it well in the comments:  People say merging black holes end up moving at half the speed of light, but don't say anything about the gravitational time dilation wherein the ""coordinate"" speed of light goes to zero at the event horizon. Which would mean black holes would have to be moving faster than the local speed of light. How can this be right?   Can things move faster than light inside the event horizon of a black hole? "

There is another, more clear way to ask the same question:     Could gravity have a repulsive term that dominates at cosmological   distances and could it be such a term that causes (accelerated)   expansion?

The units of [tex] is [tex] Mpc[tex] dex[tex]. The value of the integral is given in the following paragraph as [tex] [tex] Mpc[tex] (let's take only the first one). If I substitute the values from table 2 to the RHS of Eq 4 and then calculate I get [tex] [tex] Mpc[tex] dex[tex] . What do I do with the dex[tex]? Is it because of the dex[tex] I am a little off?   EDIT 1: Does the [tex] in the integral take care of the [tex], and my little off answer is due to rounding errors? "
2239,How difficult is adaptive optics computationally?,"What kind of computer do you need to do adaptive optics of big telescopes? Are we talking supercomputer clusters or can my desktop do it, or my smartphone? I suppose it depends on the size of the telescope and the wavelength that is targeted. I'm interested in both the kind of computers that are used and the actual number of FLOPs per second that is required. "
2240,What will be the impacts on the planets' orbits from Gliese 710?,"In 1.5 million years, the star Gliese 710 is expected to pass through the Oort cloud. Now obviously this will shower the inner solar system with comets, but the Wikipedia page doesn't say anything about the star's impact on the orbits of the planets.  Will the star not throw the Earth and other planets into highly elliptical orbits, destroying all life? Or, simply, do we not know because this would involve solving the 11-body problem? "
2241,Mountains on the moon during solar eclipse?,I ask myself the reason of why the sun in not uniform on the edge of the moon at this moment of the eclipse (cf. picture) is not unifom is because of the mountains of the moon ? Or can it due to erruptions of sun ? If not is there another reason to explain that ?   
2242,Historical Day Lengths on Earth,"I recently read something about a major earthquake in Japan having possibly shortened Earth's day due to an increase in rotation. Here's an example:  [website]When I read some more about Earth's day length, I learned that the length of Earth's day is believed to have been shorter in the past and getting longer over time. Here's an example from this site:  What was the length of the solar day 73 million years ago?  As some may know from an introductory psychology course, humans tend to settle into a day that is longer than 24 hours when placed in an environment with no external time or light cues. For most people, their circadian system is able to adjust their day to the 24-hour Earth day. Some blind people lose this ability, as seen from commercials about medication to help them gain a 24-hour rhythm. Here is some background about that:  [website]At the risk of asking an unacceptable ""opinion"" question, how convincing is the evidence of historical Earth day lengths? Is the evidence at a point where shorter Earth days in the past are an accepted certainty? Or are things still at a point of being a best guess without really knowing? It would seem rather odd for our nervous systems to have evolved with a preference for days longer than 24 hours. It is certainly possible, but I would appreciate some input here before spending time contemplating why evolution might have worked that way. I'm only a hobbyist, so there would be no need to go into too much depth for me specifically. Thanks in advance.  Edit: The current answers and comments are interesting and appreciated, but to clarify, the intended focus is the extent and quality of the astronomical evidence that could be used in a discussion (elsewhere) about circadian issues. "
2243,What is the final destination of a neutron star?,"As I understand, neutron stars are born as extremely bright, extremely fast spinning cores of stars dying in a supernova. However, several websites tell me that within a course of a few years, the surface temperature of a neutron star falls from several trillion kelvin to only a few million kelvins. Furthermore, with the passage of time, the spinning speed of the neutron star also decreases considerably.  This raises the question: what is the final destiny of a neutron star? Does it always stay so horribly magnetic, hot and fast spinning or does it keep degrading into some form of cold, extremely dense star core with a much weaker magnetic field or do some of its features (specially the magnetic field strength and spin) stay at hightened levels forever (or at least several hundreds of billions of years)? "
2244,Does wavelength affect redshift caused by the metric expansion of space?,Does wavelength play a role in cosmological redshift? Do we see certain wavelengths affected less by expansion or notice any delay in arrival of certain wavelengths?  How accurate are any observations? 
2245,Question about number density of electrons,"I somewhere see that in a white dwarf, we have this equation:  [tex]  where [tex] is the number of particles (in this case e, electrons) and [tex] is the number density. and [tex] mass is mass of proton. My problem is with the 2 in this equation. why [tex] and not just [tex]?  Also about Electric Potential Energy between a Ion and electron, somewhere said:  [tex]   I don't understand the [tex] term. Is the above really a equation or is it an approximation? I think it can't be an equation  because [tex]. "
2246,"Could an object, assuming possible, escape black hole by travelling above constant speed?","I am always hearing that after travelling inside a given BH's event horizon, the escape velocity is greater than c, which makes it impossible to escape.   Suppose an ship is inside a BH. Assume it is possible to travel faster than c. If the ship applied the faster-than-light travel, would it be able to escape a black hole?  Furthermore, it seems to me that above event horizon, the escape velocity is less than c, while inside event horizon, the escape velocity is greater than c. This leads to a further question: Does the escape velocity increase the closer you get to a BH's singularity? "
2247,Giant variation of the proposed eLISA mission using reflectors on Earth and the Moon possible?,"I was thinking about the proposed ESA mission eLISA, which is essentially a space version of the LIGO experiment, and it occurred to me that trailing three satellites behind the Earth's orbit seemed excessively complicated in comparison to using a reflector on the ground and another on the moon (if I am not mistaken, there is even already a mirror on the moon, from the Lunar Laser Ranging experiment) and a single satellite. Is there not a geosynchronous orbit with a line of sight to the moon at all times? It seems to me the added range would provide better sensitivity. Provided you know the exact distance to the reflector, you can calculate individual frequencies for the Earth and Moon lasers, downconvert the faster frequency through a PLL of sorts, and still use the resulting data in an interferometry analysis. Is there something major I am missing here that would make this arrangement more difficult than the proposed eLISA mission? It seems to shift a lot of the physical risk and cost of the mission to computational costs, which by comparison are much, much cheaper. "
2248,How far is the nearest black hole from our solar system? Is there an official list?,Which is the nearest known or suspected black hole from our solar system and how far is it from us? Is there an easily-viewed catalog that astronomers use to keep track of these? 
2249,Has someone looked the other way?,"I learned that gravity always pulls, it is always attractive. There is no antigravity, no ""negative""  mass. I also learned that most matter is dark, invisible. We know that because we see visible matter moving towards invisible bundles of dark matter and other effects like accelaration or gravity lenses.   What I ask myself is: Couldn't there be ""negative"" bundles of mass just the other way that pushes matter away instead of invisible dark matter that pulls it? Has someone tried to find something like that?  What is the proof for the fact ""Gravity is always attractive"" beside that fact that it seems to be?   Granted, it may be a stupid question, but I lack a bit in physics education that is not very related to chemistry. "
2250,Diamonds in Neptune?,"In this publication from 1981, was shown that Neptune is raining diamonds:     Many of the current models of Uranus and Neptune postulate a three-layer structure, consisting of an inner rocky core, a middle ‘ice’ layer of fluid, [tex], [tex], [tex] and an outer hydrogen–helium layer of solar composition. The estimated pressures and temperatures of the ice layer range from about 6Mbar and 7,000K at the inner core-ice boundary to [tex] 0.2 Mbar and 2,200K at the outer ice/hydrogen–helium boundary. I point out here, that shockwave experiments on these liquids, as well as theoretical studies, imply that the [tex] and [tex] in the ice layer are almost totally ionized, and the [tex] has been pyrolysed to carbon, possibly in the metallic or diamond form.   Question: In the decades since this work was published in 1981 have these predictions been addressed further, or even proven or disproven?  If this turns out to be true, would these diamonds have different physical properties than those on Earth because of the different formation mechanism?  "
2251,Does the Sun have hard radiation?,"Does the Sun spread hard radiation waves around the Solar System?  If so, why are we safe here (or are we even safe)? "
2252,"Doesn't the energy conservation law imply, that the universe can't come to a Big Freeze?",".. because, how would all the current matter and energy manifest then? Isn't everything coming to complete stop, minimal temperature, zero interaction state impossible? Wouldn't there still be some rare minor events occuring? And if so, given infinite amount of time couldn't these result in events resulting in some kind of chain-reaction? "
2253,Would gravitational waves be subject to external gravitational perturbations?,"Given that the gravitational wave detected by LIGO was a very weak echo of a very distant event, could it have been ""deviated"" and distorted on its way here by a sufficiently massive black hole in between?  Would a black hole, since it traps even light, and since gravitational waves travel at the speed of light, absorb some portion of the gravitational wave and leave a ""shadow"" in its propagation such that if a black hole was between your instrument and an incoming gravity wave you would have no way to detect it?  If so wouldn't the mass distribution in the Universe look less homogenic at larger scales (as observed), since gravity waves would not deform space uniformly and would instead need to ""equalize"" by forming voids like the Boötes void, and filament structures like the Pisces–Cetus Supercluster Complex or Sloan Great Wall?  If not, how could a gravity wave from a distant event possibly affect the gravity well of a black hole closer to the observer? It doesn't seem possible to me that the attenuated ripple in space time from an event so far away could pass right through the gravity well of a closer local black hole like a galactic supermassive black hole. "
2254,Why does Neptune only have one major moon?,"Neptune is profoundly anomalous when it comes to moons among the gas giants.  Jupiter has its four massive moons, Saturn has a several large spherical bodies and Uranus, a world similar in size to Neptune has five or so major moons.  Yet Neptune, the ice giant which sports one of the largest hill sphere radii in the solar system only has one major moon, of which is likely to be ripped to shreds in the future.  I find it peculiar because Uranus has five major moons yet Neptune only has one major moon.  What explains this disparity?  Did some disruption happen to earlier moons Neptune may have had?  What's known about this? "
2255,Are there bodies in the Universe that are not spinning?,"Do we know of a celestial body which doesn't spin at all on its own axis? If not, why is it so? "
2256,Agena docking in First Man,"In the movie, First Man Neil Armstrong and his colleague David Scott, as part of the Gemini 8 program, attempt to dock with the Agena. But it turns out to be disastrous as they go into a continuous roll over.  My question is:   What is the need for docking with the Agena and then later undocking so as to land on the moon in a smaller vessel? Why can't there be one rocket which takes the passengers, lands as a single unit and then comes back (much like how an airplane is) without docking and undocking? Wouldn't that be easier? What caused the continuous roll over and how did the RCS Brakes help in the stabilization of the vessel?  "
2257,Simple experimental evidence that Earth revolves around Sun,"What are the simplest experiments or calculations that give evidence that the earth revolves around the sun? Can you please explain them and reference the history? Many simple explanations such as this cite observations such as that relative position of two stars are observed from earth vary every night - which would not be true if the stars orbited the earth. But isn't the observation also consistent with a model where the stars orbit the earth but do so at different speeds, while the earth still orbits the sun? Simple explanations would be helpful. "
2258,What would be the average distance between each 1-degree latitude on Jupiter?,"Do planets like Jupiter have a system of latitudes and longitudes (I believe yes)? So if yes, what purpose do they serve? Is there anything different in their purpose from Earth lat-longs? and What would be the average distance between each 1-degree latitude on Jupiter? "
2259,Are there any natural satellites in retrograde Sun orbit?,"As I watch the video of the asteroids being discovered, all I see is prograde orbits. Their prevalence is fully understandable and justified, but the Sun gets interstellar visitors occasionally and I see no specific reason why it couldn't catch one into a retrograde orbit. They would obviously be a minority and likely not nearly as long-lasting as these in prograde orbits, but they should exist.  Did we observe any? If so, what sort of percentage of the whole are they? If not, why?  "
2260,Could an asteroid impact cause radioactive fallout?,"Could a (regional or global) fallout of radioactive material be a ""bonus"" disaster effect of an asteroid impact? My reasoning for how such a scenario maybe could be possible:  A) Some asteroids maybe consist of lots of radioactive heavy metals because they were initially formed by ejecta from the cores of planets during planetary collisions. Maybe even an airburst of a rather small such an asteroid could cause widespread dangerous radiak fallout?  As I understand it, Earth's initial uranium has fallen into the core. The uranium mines dig into concentrated deposits of uranium in the crust which came from uranium rich asteroids.  B) If any kind of asteroid large enough hits a uranium rich part of the Earth crust (making it the second one on the same spot), it could maybe eject much of Earth's own uranium and thus cause a dangerous fallout?

2261,"What is the 2D elliptical projection of the Celestial Sphere called, and how can I make one?","I see this kind of projection of the celestial sphere into 2D frequently, usually with an image of the milky way galaxy or cosmic microwave background.

2262,"In the JPL small body browser, why is uncertainty on absolute magnitude ""N/A""?","In the JPL small body browser, orbital elements are all provided with uncertainties and even a covariance matrix, such as for 2013 LA2.  Very good.  But underneath, the absolute magnitude is reported with a sigma of ""n/a"".  Why would the uncertainty for an absolute magnitude be not applicable?  Is it not a measurement but somehow given by definition? "
2263,Methodology for size of Universe,"I understand that the Universe could be either finite or infinite and that it is, at the least, ""very large"". :)  My question is, why doesn't the math involved in making the CMB and other predictions, in effect, tell us the size of the Universe? We know how hot it was then and how cool it is now. Does scale not affect these calculations?  In other words if a given volume is a million degrees on ""day"" one and it's now 2.5 degrees don't those temperatures change if you make the volume 200 times larger?  The calculations make the Observable Universe, the CMB and the temperatures then and now all come out right and validate the Big Bang theory. How can they do that with both a smaller Universe (Observable Universe) and the much larger actual Universe?  Is it just because whatever the size of the Universe is, it was all 1 million degrees (example) at one point? Otherwise, it seems the predictive math involved would produce different numbers for different volume. "
2264,Polarization of an emission line,"Say I have a flux density spectrum of a galaxy, as well as polarization spectra for the object in U, Q, and P. I want to find the polarization of some emission line in the spectrum. First, I can fit a line to my flux spectrum which will give me the continuum (i.e. without the peak(s)). I can then subtract the continuum from the whole spectrum to get just the profile of the emission line. But I'm unclear on how to relate these results with the polarization spectrum (right now I'm just working with the Q). I'm guessing I need to subtract the continuum polarization from my polarization spectrum, which would also involve converting my flux continuum to some polarization units, but how do I do this? Do I need the U or P (total) portion as well to do this? "

2267,If the moon still had a magnetic field how long would have been possible to keep an atmosphere?,"Let's assume the Moon had a considerable magnetic field to prevent the atmosphere dispersion caused by solar wind. Given the low gravity of the Moon, how many years would pass before all the gases (of an Earth like atmosphere) would escape its body? Would its gravity be sufficient to trap heavier gases like CO2?

2268,How to correctly create planetary orbits from kepler elements,"I would like to build a gravity model (with 3D graphics) that would build the orbit of the planets based on orbital elements input and the gravity calculation for each element.   My initial code is live here (Click the 0.005 to turn it into 0.05 and then click on restart time to run the orbits).  The example above has all planets on Solar System (up to Neptune), the Sun and the asteroid Apophis. For clarity, the Sun and planets other than earth have been hidden, but are still considered for gravity calculations.  However, the orbits do not match the correct estimate intersection date. In this article, it says that Earth-Apophis close-encounters will happen on 13 April (meaning that the earth should be in the orbit's intersection point every 13 April, or very close to it).  The data from the program is taken from Nasa JPL.   Apophis Data Planets Data The sun is positioned at the origin   Start date is 2454441.5, as given in JPL Apophis data. Planets orbital elements have been corrected to this date, with the calculations in the above PDF.  Why the orbits intersection date is wrong? Should I be doing something else? Am I doing something wrong?  The above Apophis link also cites a ""Standard Dynamical Model"". If anyone knows how to correctly create one, I believe this would answer my question as well.  TLDR: How can I correctly create planetary orbits from kepler elements?  Thank you in advance if anyone can help me! "
2269,Gamma ray detection for SETI. How far away could we detect an alien nuclear powered rocket?,"I suspect our best bet for finding advanced civilisations is to look for gamma rays characteristic of nuclear/antimatter propulsion.  If an alien civilisation was using something similar to the Orion drive, how close would they have to be for us to be able to detect the gamma rays?    In my mind, this question has two parts: What are the magnitude/frequency limits on the gamma ray telescopes in orbit? (Specifically Fermi, assuming that has the best detection capabilities of an orbital gamma ray observatory)  What's the magnitude and frequency profile on, say, a 1 megaton nuclear bomb?   I've had a bit of trouble finding these out myself from a casual search, and am wondering if maybe there are military secret issues surrounding the detection of gamma rays.  "
2270,Changes of the velocity of the Moon due to impacts from other objects?,Has the moon’s velocity changed since ‘shortly’ after it’s formation due to impacts?   Wouldn't it be likely that a significant collision would have occurred over such a long period of time?   It would seem an object with enough momentum to change the velocity of the Moon would have made an impact on its velocity at some point over the millennia.  
2271,Which astronomer set his beard on fire because he left the cap off his telescopes finder?,"There is a famous story of an experienced astronomer setting his beard on fire because he left the cap off his telescopes finder.

2272,How do we have photos of galaxies so far away?,"A possible answer for this is that, light emitted from the galaxies travelled a billion miles all the way to earth, where the hubble space telescope picked up this light through its sensors, and was able to construct an image of the galaxy  but if this is true, and galaxies are billions of miles away, shouldn't the light particles emitted from the galaxies be scattered all over the place? after all they have been travelling from millions of years, and have probably collided with asteroids and other foreign objects. What were the chances that about 95% of the photons actually reached earth, giving us a very detailed image.   Consider the andromeda galaxy which has a distance of 1.492 × 10^19 mi from earth. If light emitted from the galaxy travels in all directions, then how is it that we can still map out the entire galaxy, evident from the photo below?  Shouldn't like half of the galaxy be missing since photons could have hit other objects, and ""never have reached earth""?    "

2274,What actually determines the angular uncertainty of the source of a detected gravitational wave?,"This answer and comments got me thinking. Astrometry 101 tells us that while we can use [tex] as an estimator of resolution, if we can assume a point source we can determine the centroid or position to far higher precision.   For example, GAIA's design targets for precision were roughly 7, 20, and 200 micro-arcseconds for visual magnitudes 10, 15, and 20, respectively whereas [tex]  gives 70,000 x 200,000 micro-arcseconds for its rectangular mirror.  The limitations are both instrumental beyond just the aperture or baseline, and connected to the nature of the signal, and that's were determining the direction of a gravitational wave source is very different than determining the direction of a star's light.  Question: For gravitational waves then, what actually determines the angular uncertainty of the source direction? Does it turn out to be baseline-limited (e.g. [tex]) or instrument-limited, or limited by the very short-lived and chirped nature of the signal? Or is it something else, perhaps in the modeling and reconstruction of the event itself?  From ligo.caltech.edu's Gravitational-Wave Observatories Across the Globe just for background:   "

I know that sound waves must travel through a medium ""air"", enter our brains, and then we can decipher what exactly the sound is.  But in space, there is no air, and so does that mean that no sound waves are being produced, or that there are waves, but we cannot hear them because they never reach us  And how can we tell? We cannot ""hear"" space, so who says its because theres no air, rather then just because ""its not being produced in the first place?"" "
2277,Who first observed another planet rotating?,"We knew the earth rotates, but the moon is tidally locked.  To tell that another planet is rotating, you have to be able to distinguish its surface (I guess?). Who first did this? "
2278,How come moon's difference in thickness between sides does not create an unbalance on its mass?,"I've just found out that moon's dark side is 30 miles thicker then the closer side to the Earth. So I'm wondering about moon's mass. How come it's still balanced? Supposing the far side is indeed heavier, considering More Mass More Gravity, wouldn't it have to be closer to Earth?  Sorry if I'm making stupid assumptions, I'm just a curious fela.  "
2279,How to scale down solar system data to simulatable values,"Okay, I am seriously ashamed for asking this especialy when I geniualy study on physics but there is something that bugs me with the simulation I am working on.  I am re-creating the solar system in an n-body simulation that i programmed before. And I've a problem with scaling down the solar data. So even if I use kg and km for the metric units, the values are far bigger than the variables can hold in programming. Also as some of you know, bigger the value is, bigger the floating point error it makes. (error noise in data) Also it makes it slower to process.  I decided to scale down the data with a reference point, and for that, I took the earth's radius as 1 unit. And scaled down every other distance and radius according to it. (So a unit is 6371 km just to be clear)  But I am not sure whether if I should scale down the mass or not. My common sense says that I should scale down the mass so density of each body should remain same. So I took the density, and calculated a new mass value for each body, with the new scaled down radius. But I am somehow couldn't conviced myself about If it's true or not. So here I am, asking to you :) Should I also scale down the mass?  PS.1: I used using F = GMm/r^2 equation for the calculactions as usual. (Iterating it through each body pairs)  If there are other programmers like me interested in making a simulation like this, how did you accomplish this data size problem? Are there any better solutions than scaling down the values?  PS. I have created an excel file that does the scale conversion. So I am sharing  the sheet in OneDrive. ([website]"
2280,Frequency of Earth type cores?,I've read many interesting threads concerning the composition of different planet cores in the solar system while trying to see if this question has already been asked. It appears as if Earth is unique regarding magnetic field strength and interior activity for our size compared with our rocky neighbors.   I was wondering if the general consensus was that most rocky-type planets our size would share the same characteristics (such as magnetic field strength and convection flow) as us? Or if we are the outliers and most extra solar planets similar to us are expected to be more like Mars or Venus? 
2281,Is the expected time for a star in an elliptical galaxy to collide with another star less than the average age of elliptical galaxies?,"According to the Wikipedia article Elliptical galaxy, elliptical galaxies have a much lower concentration of gas between the stars than spiral galaxies. I know that until the gas is below a certain concentration, its atoms don't travel very far between collisions and it follows the normal gas laws and the gas actually flows into the stars when they pass by. I know that when the interstellar gas is at such a low concentration that atoms on average travel a much larger distance than the average diameter of a star in the elliptical galaxy it's in, the gas doesn't follow the normal gas laws and gas gets mainly absorbed into stars by happening to be headed towards one and colliding with it rather than by flowing towards one and the ratio of the rate of absorption of gas into stars to the concentration of interstellar gas is lower, and a star has about the same expected time before colliding with another star as an interstellar gas atom has before colliding with a star. I also know that when the interstellar medium is at the equilibrium concentration, there are 3 possible driving forces for the reduction of interstellar gas; star formation, flow of interstellar gas into stars, and random collisions of interstellar gas atoms with a star which can only occur at very low concentration; and 2 driving forces for the increase in interstellar gas, the slow escape of gas molecules from stars and collisions between stars because collisions occur at a high enough speed to produce an explosion instead of combining into a larger star. Which driving force for the reduction of interstellar gas is the largest? Also, which driving force for the increase in interstellar gas is larger? If it's star formation, that means the interstellar gas is at a high enough concentration to follow the normal gas laws but since the amount of interstallar gas is at equilibrium, the main driving force for the increase in interstellar gas is collisions between stars. If it's the slow escape of gas from stars, the main driving force for the decrease in interstellar gas could be the flow of gas into stars or the random collisions of gas molecules with stars but not star formation. If the main driving force for the reduction in interstallr gas concentration is collisions of gas molecules with stars, then a star has about the same expected time beofre a collision with another star as an intersteller gas atom has before colliding with another star so the expected time before a star collides with another star is less than the age of the galaxy and if it's flow of gas into stars, the main driving force for the increase in interstellar gas could be either of the two driving forces but if the driving force for the increase is collisions between stars, the expected time before a star collides with another star is less than the age of the galaxy,   On the other hand, if the interstellar gas concentration has not yet reached equilibrium, it could be that not enough time has gone by for the interstellar gas to not follow the normal gas laws and star formation occurs mainly by the gas coalescing into stars. It could also be that the interstellar gas started diving exponentially until it stopped following the normal gas laws then the rate at which it divides exponentially greatly reduced so it has not yet had time to reach the equilibrium concentration. "
2282,What determines which frequency range a radio telescope has?,"My simple understanding is that a parabolic dish focuses radio waves to a receiver. It is obvious that any parabola focuses visible light and heat, so I assume that it focuses all radio wavelengths too. So evidently the design of the receiver determines which wavelengths it is sensitive to.   How is such a receiver designed in radio telescopes? What properties of the receiver determine the wavelengths it is sensitive to? Is the sensitivity range electronically adjustable? Why aren't different receivers used so that the same parabola, for example the huge Arecibo dish, could be used for all wavelengths? (Or is it?) What importance does the size and material of the parabola have for the sensitivity to different radio wavelengths?  "
2283,Is there a name for the star/supernova hypothesized to have been a precursor to the Solar System?,I found an article suggesting a supernova injected debris which helped nudge the formation of the Solar System 4.5 billion years ago.  I couldn't find a name for this hypothetical star/supernova after some research. Is there one? What is it? 
2284,How exactly does Hawking radiation decrease the mass of black holes?,"From what I understand so far, when one of virtual particles crosses the event horizon and the other does not, they can not annihilate each other. The latter wanders off into the universe (btw, is it still virtual at this point, and what does 'virtual' mean at this point, if so?), while the other gets consumed by the black hole. I don't see how this event contributes to evaporation of the black hole (since the particles do not originate from the black hole). Shouldn't the consumed particle actually add-up to the black hole mass?  The closest question to mine is Does Hawking radiation in fact bring mass into the universe?, but I don't find the answers satisfactory.  I.e. ""the escaped virtual particle is 'boosted' by black hole's gravitational field into becoming a real particle"", rather adds to the question then answer it.  EDIT: I am humbled by the knowledge presented in the answers and feel incompetent to mark any as the most suitable. I hope this is okay. "
2285,"A ""tidally locked"" double planet?","First, I'd like to take the definition of a ""double-planet"" as two bodies orbiting each other where the center of gravity is not inside the larger body. Also, the system would have to fill other planet requirements (like emptying it's own orbital area around the star).  Now, let's say that the ""binary system"" is in an orbit close enough to a star to be tidally locked to the star. How would the tidal effects of the star's gravity effect the orbit of the planets around each other??  Let's take an example of a ""double-planet"" (of [tex] and [tex] with a separation of [tex] orbiting their CM in about [tex]. They are [tex] from a star of mass [tex] and thus orbit the star in [tex]. The planetary rotation/co-orbital period is much longer than the orbital period around the star, so I would think that the planets would have characteristics of a lone TL planet.  I am wondering how such a system would evolve over time. Would someone on the surface of one of the planets experience experience night and day in 15.3 day cycles? Would the difference in tidal effects of the star on the different sized planets cause the orbit to ""precess"" or have some other effect?  Imagine designing a long term calendar for this system!! "
2286,Is there any cosmological evidence that neutrinos travel at a speed other than c?,"I've been looking into neutrinos. One thing I'm puzzled about is how fast they travel.   See the Wikipedia SN1987A article where you can read this: “approximately two to three hours before the visible light from SN1987A reached Earth, a burst of neutrinos was observed at three separate neutrino observatories”. Some reports describe an initial burst of neutrinos which arrived 7.7 hours before the light. It's thought that the neutrinos were emitted before the light because of the way stars collapse, wherein photons take longer to get out. I don't have much of an issue with that. But what's interesting is that in 168,000 years travelling through space, the photons didn’t overtake the neutrinos. That suggests to me that neutrinos are massless, which ties in with what Fermi said in section VII of his 1934 paper. He plotted three curves and noted that the μ=0 curve matched the empirical curves. He concluded that “the rest mass of the neutrino is either zero, or, in any case, very small in comparison to the mass of the electron”.  The thing is that if neutrinos travel at exactly c they have no mass at all. And I can't find any evidence that they don't. I can find plenty of evidence for electrons travelling at speeds less than c. The neutrino is said to be a fermion like an electron. But I can't find any evidence of neutrinos travelling at speeds less than c.   Can anybody give me a reference to any cosmological evidence that neutrinos travel at less than c? Or any other hard scientific evidence? By evidence I don't mean an inference such as ""neutrinos go missing so they must oscillate therefore they must have mass therefore they must travel at less than c"". I mean evidence.  "
2287,Does the edge of the Universe travel faster than the speed of light?,The Universe is expanding faster than the speed of light then does that mean matter at the edge of the universe is also traveling at the speed of light or are ether opposite sides of the universe are expanding over half the speed of light equaling more than the speed of light ? Looking from outside of the universe to the nearest edge would light proceed slower or faster combined with the speed of matter traveling on the edge of the universe?   
2288,Can an asteroid have rings?,"I know an asteroid can have moons, but how about rings? Does it also get affected by the Roche limit?  The asteroid Florence has two moons.  "
2289,"Can we know where (South, East, West...) the moon will be at a specific time?","Apparently, a few nights from now (more specifically on the night between the 27th and 28th of September this year, nights being Belgian nights), we will have a lunar eclipse.  That's great, and I wish I could find a nice spot to go see that with friends!  Sadly I never took a lot of time watching the moon with a compass in my hands, so I'm wondering:  Can we know at what orientation (as in North, South etc) will the moon show up from Brussels between 12PM and 4AM GMT in the night of 27th to 28th September?  What are the calculations and/or data source involved? "
2290,What would happen if an ice cube is left in space?,Recently I boarded a flight and noticed outside air temperature as -53°C at an altitude of 36860ft (11.23km). I don't know what causes such a freezing temperature in that altitude but was wondering higher altitudes (space) may have even freezing temperatures. Here I got a doubt i.e what happens if an ice cube is left in space? Would it be melting or stay as it is? 
2291,When will Sirius be closest to the solar system?,"Sirius is currently approaching the solar system, at a rate of 5.5 km/s, consequently in the future it will be closer and therefore brighter. When will Sirius pass closest to the solar system? How far will it then be from the sun, and what magnitude will it reach? "
2292,At what speed does something have to travel away from us for it to red shift enough that it becomes invisible to the human eye?,"Are there stars, galaxies etc that we cannot see because they are traveling too fast and their spectrum is shifted below our visible range? From what I understand, red shift is caused by stars and such moving away from the viewer. At what speed does a star etc have to travel to be invisible to us?  What if you are in one galaxy on one side of the universe that is expanding looking at a galaxy on the other expanding edge side. They would be traveling faster than the speed of light away from each other. Would they be invisible to each other? "
2293,Biosignatures for anaerobic or other early microbiology?,"What are some possible atmospheric bio-signatures for a planet with anaerobic life? or even microorganisms before oxygen builds up in the atmosphere?

2296,Black-hole becoming a star again - follow-up question,"Some questions have been posed about black holes becoming stars again once they attract enough hydrogen/atomic matter from another star. Some answers were a forceful NO. Never. However - let's ponder this again:  Question: Once material is absorbed, is there a physical reason why fusion cannot take place once more? Does the process of entering the black hole strip out all the nuclear energy contained in mass/matter? Or is it that matter that makes it past the event horizon has potential to fuse but because of that time dilation due to the already present dense mass make this process take billions of years to resolve?  "
2297,Do we know at which angle the Event Horizon Telescope will look at the accretion disk of Sagittarius A*?,"Do we know at which angle the Event Horizon Telescope will look at the accretion disk of Sagittarius A*?

2298,Stratospheric Balloon with an Xray camera,"Some colleagues and I were planning to launch a stratospheric balloon in December. A thought occurred to me: what if we were to put some sort of xray camera in the payload? We are expecting a maximum altitude of about 80,000 feet. Would it work any better at that altitude?  "
2299,How much mass does our sun need for exploding like supernova?,"Beside that, is that possible our sun became pulsar? And if not (and i know likely) but how much more mass does it need to become one ? "
2300,Could an impact have resurfaced Venus 300 million years ago?,"Venus surface isn't older than about 300 million years. The only explanation I've come across is that some kind of global volcanism resurfaced the planet. But couldn't it have been an impact event? A huge comet hitting it by chance, maybe making Venus tip over and stop spinning too.  Or could Venus have had a moon like Phobos which spiraled inwards, disintegrated and rained down during a few million years? Phobos will do so in only 50 million years, maybe it is a common feature for terrestrial planets to form with such moons that hit them billions of years later. Maybe Earth is an exception because of the large Moon and how it formed.  Would an impact event leave visible traces like impact basins, or could the entire surface melt and reform as it is today, as I suppose Earth did when the Moon formed? Could Venus have been a very different planet up until 0.3 billion years ago? How could one find out, what kind of investigation would be needed?  Pluto's mass is about 1/50th of Mars (and Theia), so I suppose that it would be enough for a Pluto sized comet to have had about 7 times the impact speed compared to the pre-Earth/Theia collision. Comets could have up to 70+35 km/s speed relative to Venus. Someone maybe can make a rough estimate of what's needed to resurface Venus and how likely such an impact event would be?  And could reformation and redifferentiation after an impact have eliminated a previous magnetic field?  The diversity of the planets and moons, I suggest, depend more on their vast history of random events, than on where and how they once formed. I suspect that planetary scientists generally want to discount a unique planet reforming event only 0.3 billion years ago, just to make their job a bit easier ;-) "
2301,Is there any significant time dilation on other planets orbiting the sun?,"Is there significant time dilation on the other planets orbiting the sun?  Would an 'hour' experienced on earth actually be 59 or 61 minutes on other planets, depending on their distance to the sun?  What about the moons orbiting Jupiter? "
2302,How did VLT's adaptive optics obtain this resolution for Neptune? Is it really working in visible wavelengths?,"This image of Neptune taken with the VLT is really impressive. The resolution is achieved by recent improvements in the adaptive optics.   Gizmodo: New Super-Crisp Images of Neptune Show How Far Our Telescopes Have Come Space.com Telescope Upgrade Produces Stunningly Clear Views of Space   But I don't really understand, is this coming from just one 8 meter mirror, or is this using more than one of the four that make up the VLT? Also, is this really using adaptive optics that work in the visible, including blue wavelengths? Or is this a false-color image? See the excellent answer(s) to Why (actually) aren't ground-based observatories using adaptive optics for visible wavelengths?   "
2303,How does light so travel so fast?.,"I've read that photon's have zero mass, hence no force is needed to accelerate them. But then the second question. How can gravity affect something which has 0 mass?. Yes, gravity(black hole) can bend space and time but how can 0 mass particle be affected by this?. What am i missing.? "
2304,Can we find out whether early Venus was Earth-like or not?,"It has been speculated that Venus billions of years ago could've had a much different atmosphere with liquid water on its surface and possibly life. Partly thanks to the cooler young Sun. But is it possible for science to find out?  What traces would remain that our probes could measure? AFAIK Venus was completely resurfaced 300-600 million years ago so I suppose there won't be any geological signs of water of the kind found on Mars. And the atmosphere obviously has changed dramatically if Venus was once Earth-like. What should we look for to discover the evolution of Venus? What instruments should we land there, or fly in its atmosphere or orbit? "
2305,Why we define Stellar motions with respect to sun?,"We take observations from earth but to define radial velocity, transverse velocity and the proper motion of stars, why we consider them with respect to the sun? and then we do some corrections due to both rotational and orbital motion of the earth.  Why can't we directly consider these motions with respect to earth instead of Sun?  And what is the whole procedure of correction? "
2306,Does the size of the atom limit the focal length of telescopes?,"Does the size of the atom place a theoretical limit on a telescope's focal length (and thus, resolution)?  It seems to me that that the allowed margin of error for parabolic mirrors drops with an increasing focal length. It's already like 25 nm for advanced Earth-based telescopes - which is just 50-250 atoms.  If we try building mirrors with an ever increasing focal length (e. g. as a part of a huge space-based interferometer), will we eventually reach a point where the precision required will be less than the size of the atom and thus no longer achievable? If yes, how far away are we from this limit now?  If we had unlimited resources, would it be possible to construct a space-based telescope for imagining extrasolar planets in great detail, or would this be not even theoretically possible due to the fixed atom size? "
2307,Use of kugelblitz to delay heat death,"I may be way off the mark here, but wouldn't it be possible to use kugelblitz (artificial black holes formed from a concentration of radiation rather than matter) to significantly delay heat death? The black hole would reconcentrate diffuse matter and turn it into usable energy. It may not be especially practical due to the limited range of the kugelblitz's gravitational field, but if nothing else, couldn't it be used to create energy by feeding it matter? With its smaller size, it would release the produced energy through Hawking radiation much faster than stellar or supermassive black holes. "
2308,The Solar Motion and the peculiar velocities of stars,Local standard Of Rest is the hypothetical origin of a reference system with respect to which the motions of all stars in some neighborhood of the sun average out to be zero  which type of motions of stars average out to be zero and how can I justify that their average will be zero?

2310,Why do GPS satellites move in relation to earth's surface?,Wouldn't it be easier with geostationary satellites? Has is to do with the monitoring of gamma-ray bursts? 
2311,Spheres in space,"I know that gravity will turn a mass into a sphere, which is why planets and stars are that shape. But then we have asteroids and small moons which are not spherical. Such as a couple of Pluto's moons. Is there a size at which they will become spheres? Is it dependent on their composition? Does it need a certain mass? Is it only because of the heat of collisions melted the rocky planets that they became this shape while they were semi liquid? "
2312,What kind of a visual trajectory would an asteroid have if it were to hit Earth?,"Let's say that Peter has a set of superb telescopes and he's watching the sky every night, for 3-4 months. He may not know it just yet, but there is an asteroid heading towards Earth, on a crash course. He is too lazy to plot an orbit, because he doesn't believe he could die like that.  Over the months the Earth travels quite a lot around the Sun, resulting in various amounts of parallax, depending on the distance. The location of the telescopes are also a factor, and so is the (rotation of the) axis of Earth.  To simplify this and to get rid of Earth radius parallax, Peter is a researcher on the South Pole with those mighty telescopes. Over the course of months, what kind of a trajectory would a doomsday asteroid make? As it gets bigger/brighter (which is also relative, because the asteroid itself can rotate)/closer, how would its position change, compared to the stars in the background? Would the change slow down or accelerate? Would it be a small piece of a spiral (I don't mean complete spirals, just the fact that it wouldn't be a parabola or a circle)? What do you think Peter would see if he animated its movement during the course of months on a virtual sky sphere?  The National Geographic article Asteroid Called ‘Spooky’ Will Buzz Earth on Halloween has an animation of the trajectory of asteroid 2015 TB145 (nicknamed Spooky because it looks like a skull).  16 minutes apart visual timelapse: [website]"
2313,What defines the plane of an accretion disk around a black hole?,"The question Do we know at which angle the Event Horizon Telescope will look at the accretion disk of Sagittarius A*? about just how close to edge-on we would be viewing any accretion disk around the black hole in the center of our galaxy, and @Zephyr's excellent answer have got be thinking about the geometry and angular momentum.  While the angular momentum vector of a black hole will likely reflect that of all the matter that fell into it , would the plane of any accretion disk around a black hole reflect the black hole's current equatorial plane, or a plane defined by rotation of whatever material is currently falling in to it?  Another way to formulate this question might be to propose an incredibly unlikely Gedankenexperiment. If I inserted a black hole into the center of a rotating disk of material so that the black hole's axis was in the plane of the disk of material rather than parallel to its rotational axis, would a well-defined accretion disk form all all, and if so, what would determine the orientation of that plane? "
2314,Is dust extinction/reddening caused by Rayleigh scattering or some other physics phenomenon (or both)?,"I know from Rayleigh scattering that in the atmosphere redder photons are scattered less than bluer photons by the particles that both make up and are floating around in the atmosphere.  This is why the sky is blue and sunsets are red.  My question is, is the physics behind Rayleigh scattering (which, according to wikipedia, is due to the electric polarizability of the molecules) the same physics behind dust extinction? Additionally, is it the only physics in play or is there additional physics that causes the phenomenon? "
2315,Question about finding energy density of a fermionic-bosonic gas,"We know that energy density is given by this formula:  [tex]  Where [tex] for relativistic particles. also [tex] where minus is for bosons and plus is for fermions.  Now if we evaluate this for photons which have [tex] we get [tex] where [tex] is radiation constant.  If electrons and positrons are in equilibrium with photons (so [tex] and [tex]) We will get [tex]  equilibrium equation: [tex]   Now think we have electron+ positron + three types of neutrinos + three types of anti neutrinos which are at all in equilibrium with photons. [tex] for neutrinos and anti neutrinos. now how can we get an equation for energy density? what we must use for [tex]?  I am also not sure about [tex], Is it the energy density of electrons or positrons (so the total energy density is [tex]) or energy of both of them is in this equation?  Note: All of the particles are relativistic. These question conditions is for early universe. "
2316,"Less stars in the night, compared to 15-20 years back","I am not sure if my question is true or not. But this is what I observe regularly. When I was young and when I look at the sky, there were too many many stars were there. But now, from few months I'm observing the sky (by eyes, not any telescope), I see very few stars. Perhaps, countable.  Is it because:   Stars are dead? (Not all) As I read somewhere, by the time you see the star, it would have been dead. Because, the light would've traveled so many years to reach earth. By the time, star would have completed 'X' light years and it is dead by now? Current position of the earth in galaxy: As I read, the earth will not always traverse in the same path around the sun. So the current view from the earth to the sky, may not have any star? (This is my guess/imagination, I'm not sure) Is it because of the city light/ pollution?   PS: Please be easy. May be the question is broad or simple, just want to know the brief answer and if its complete explanatory, I'm happy for that. "
2317,Can we draw a min(distance) and max(mass) relation based on current observation data of nearby astronomical objects within several parcsecs?,"The data precision now can exclude a >>[tex] black hole companion, which has a, say 10000 year orbital period with our sun?  Can we draw a two dimensional diagram(Mass VS. distance) to show the region that is still a grey area? Within 1 pc, there is no stellar mass black hole? If there is one, the orbit change of objects in solar system may be detectable.  How to calculate its proper motion or its planets' proper motion?  I am serious to ask. Please give some reference/technical method to calculate PM. For example, is there some reference paper about the distance limitation of the black hole based on the motion of asteroids/comets?   "
2318,What information will SETI have access to from the SKA (Square kilometer array),I read on on the website of the SKA ([website]How much of the data will they have access to? Everything?

It seems as if the sun stops in between, retraces a bit and then continues towards the west. What is the reason for this strange motion? Is it because of variation in the distance between mercury and the sun? Or is it because a day on Mercury is longer than Mercury's year? "

2322,"Will the 2016 Perseid meteor shower be visible in Sydney, Australia?","As the title states, will viewers in Sydney, Australia be able to see the Perseid meteor shower in August, 2016? Assume the viewer is well outside of the city and light pollution is a minimal problem.  According to Australian Geographic, the event will be visible in the northern parts of the country &ndash; specifically, ""head north for the best chance to witness the event"" &ndash; but it is not clear whether it will be possible to see anything in the southern parts.  If any viewing is possible, what would be the recommended dates and time of night to see the most? "
2323,Why is right ascension measured on a 24 hour scale rather than a 23 hours and 56 minutes scale?,"From several texts I have read, I have learned that right ascension is measured on a scale of 24 hours. I understand that Earth rotates almost exactly 360 degrees relative to distant objects, which is what RA is used for. The 24 hour system should only apply to the 361 degree rotation period (solar day). Why then do we split the sidereal day of the earth into 24 hours, when if it were split into 23 hours and 56 minutes we could know where an object would be x hours away after x hours?  More (possibly) relevant information: I understand the Hour Angle HR is the measure of how far Aries is from the local meridian (RA of current meridian of longitude). This way you could calculate how many hours away the object is, but once again, this would not be exactly correct as 4 minutes has to be subtracted from the 24 hour scale, multiplying the whole time to something like 99.7% (14.44 degrees per hour), correct?  Thanks, this is really confusing me and I would appreciate some help. I did see a similar question but that had nothing to do with the sidereal day v. solar day issue I'm having.  "
2324,Tidal influences of planets on the sun,"How big are the tidal influences of planets (say, Jupiter) on the sun? Do they lead to any measurable effects, for example, do they influence the sunspots, or are they observable in any other way? "
2325,Can all areas on Earth experience a total solar eclipse?,"A solar eclipse only puts part of Earth at a time in shadow, so I'm not talking about a solar eclipse that casts a shadow over all of Earth.  What I mean is: are there any areas on Earth where, no matter how Sol, Earth and Luna are aligned, a total solar eclipse is impossible? Can the penumbra cast a shade on any part of Earth, or are there certain areas where a penumbra due to a solar eclipse cannot occur? "
2326,Sun from SuperNova,"I have read that our sun was created from older star(s) which had exploded in a supernova. If all the matter is travelling away from the central point of explosion, how does it coalesce back into a nebula and then form a sun?  Wouldn't all the matter just keep moving further and further apart?  Wouldn't gravity be far too weak to bring it all back together into one place? "
2327,How to calculate true equinox position?,"I'm trying to calculate the state of the Earth at a given time using Keplerian orbital elements from this page. It has the following instruction:        Compute the coordinates, [tex], in the J2000 ecliptic plane, with the x-axis aligned toward the equinox:      So after this calculation we are supposed to know direction of some equinox. But there exists the phenomenon of precession of equinoxes, so this direction shouldn't in general be fixed. I assume the equinox mentioned in that document is some ""mean"" equinox for the range of dates the data are valid for.  So, how do I calculate the true equinox position/direction, given these data? "
2328,"How did ""oddball"" Valetudo, Jupiter's new prograde moon, end up in a wider orbit?","I just saw this question and that got me to this NASA page which led me to this scientific article.        “Our other discovery is a real oddball and has an orbit like no other known Jovian moon,” Sheppard explained. “It’s also likely Jupiter’s smallest known moon, being less than one kilometer in diameter”.       This new “oddball” moon is more distant and more inclined than the prograde group of moons and takes about one and a half years to orbit Jupiter.  So, unlike the closer-in prograde group of moons, this new oddball prograde moon has an orbit that crosses the outer retrograde moons.      As a result, head-on collisions are much more likely to occur between the “oddball” prograde and the retrograde moons, which are moving in opposite directions.       “This is an unstable situation,” said Sheppard. “Head-on collisions would quickly break apart and grind the objects down to dust.”     My question is, why are most of the moons that are further away from Jupiter retrograde orbits, while the ones extremely close to Jupiter are prograde orbits? What possible situations were required for Valetudo to end up where it is opposed to where the rest of the pro-grade moons are clustered? Pure chance / a series of unlikely events? "
2329,Is it possible to define a state of zero absolute angular momentum anywhere in the universe?,"Conservation of angular momentum doesn't seem correct to me. I think this because radiation is present everywhere, no space is completely void, and no object perfect. Thus all objects will have uneven radiation pressure. My question is there anything in space that is not increasing or decreasing in rotation or is fixed in space? Is the rate in which an object spins is determined by surrounding celestial bodies? Or in other words any object in space depending on its position in the galaxy will slow or increase to an ideal rotation? "
2330,"Why is the ""green"" comet C/2014 Q2 (Lovejoy) red in this picture?","In this nice NYTimes 'survey article' ""Our Vast Solar System and Its Many Explorers"" there is a NEOWISE image of Comet C/2014 Q2 (Lovejoy). See here also.  The NASA description of the image says:     The red color is caused by the strong signal in the NEOWISE 4.6-micron wavelength detector, owing to a combination of gas and dust in the comet's coma.   So I understand that this is a false color image, and the image at 4.6-micron is overlaid using red. So I should really ask: why is Comet C/2014 Q2 (Lovejoy) (and probably many) comet actually bright at 4.6 microns ""...owing to a combination of gas and dust in the comet's coma."" Is the gas fluorescing and the dust scattering? Or is this thermal radiation from the dust? The explanation in quotes doesn't really explain why ""the red color is caused by the strong signal (around) 4.6-micron wavelength (is) owing to a combination of gas and dust in the comet's coma.""    below: The more familiar green glow of this (and many) comet from here.   "
2331,Do heavier elements breakdown during supernova?,"Heavier elements like gold, uranium etc. are formed at the end of a star's life. As the star explodes into a supernova, it gives rise to nebula which is the birthplace of new stars. But as the star has already fused lighter elements into heavier elements, where does the new hydrogen required for the formation of new stars come from? Do heavier elements breakdown during supernova or is it some other process? "
2332,How can one explain the apparent motion of the Sun from a heliocentric point of view?,"From a horizontal frame of reference, the path of the Sun looks like a part of a circle in a tilted plane, as shown in this picture:  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  If you go to a heliocentric system, one would say that this is because the Earth is rotating around it's axis. Is there any more detailed explanation of this change of reference?   So how can one explain in detail the following facts (seen from a geocentric point of view - horizontal reference system) starting from a heliocentric system and the fact that the Earth is rotating around it's axis:   Why is the path of the Sun a part of a circle?  Why is this path in a plane? Why is this plane tilted? How to get this ""tilt-angle""?   Why does this motion seem to be uniform from an equatorial point of view, and can I neglect the ecliptic to understand the points above?  I tried to model it using a ball as Earth, attached a camera to it and used another ball as the Sun, but I didn't succeed in reproducing the effect of the apparent motion in this model. Perhaps there is any animation which makes the points above clear. "
2333,Do/Can Ringed Stars Exist?,"The other night, while playing Elite: Dangerous, I came across a rather strange celestial body - one I never imagined possible.  It was a Brown Dwarf star with a very large ring.    Is something like this even remotely possible? Have such objects actually been seen?  It was also quite interesting that this star wasn't even the primary star in the system. It was orbiting a larger star (blue-white, I think), along with several planets.   "
2334,What is the oldest known prediction of constellation positions?,"Would someone know of a good reference on the oldest known predictions of constellation positions?

2335,Estimation of average rock and asteroid mass associated with different stars,"There is a lot of information on different star types and compositions.   Can we make estimates of the total mass of rock, ice, and non stellar matter that orbits stars based on star evolution models?  Take, for example, the sun - are there studies of the total mass of non-solar material associated with the sun and it's composition regardless of accretion. What about nearby stars?  Can we estimate how much non-incandescent material the galaxy contains aside from dark matter? "
2336,Which came first: Galaxies <=> Stars <=> Planets?,"If a galaxy is defined as a collection of planetary systems (and all matter in between), and a planetary system is defined as a collection of planets circling a star (and all matter in between), and a planet (and other smaller bodies, like asteroids, moonlets, moons, etc) is basically just a very very, very large collection of minerals, stardust and gases (which make up the entire universe), which came first: The planets, planetary systems or galaxies? I've been given to understand the universe came first...but after that?  I thought I understood, at least the layman's basics, of the universe formation. However, today, I’m having trouble conceptualising the order in which they would have been formed, IF they are defined by the smaller unit.    Is this just me getting the semantics of classification and the actual chronology of each feature forming, mixed up?       VERY Basically,   The universe is made up of a complex mix of everything (matter, antimatter, darkmatter, to name just a few), and expanding 'space'. A very, very, large area of 'space' is covered in very, very, tiny particles: made up of at first gases and later 'stardust'. A galaxy is formed of gravity-attracted gases, and after the very first stars went supernova and exploded there was also 'stardust', which combines to create 'clumps' of interstellar clouds (cloud nebulae). The cloud nebulae are the 'nursery' areas for star formation (both initial stars and later generation stars).  The newly created star uses remnants of 'stardust' in the cloud nebulae to form planetary systems and then, a 'short' time later the orbiting planets (and other sized objects).    So then the chronological order would be:   Universe (Largest scale) => gases (very small scale) => galaxy => interstellar clouds => stars => planets (combined to form planetary systems). And the tiny particles of gases and 'stardust', are involved in nearly all scales.   Image taken from spaceexplained     Just writing out this question has helped! I hope you don't mind me posting it anyway, as it might help others and I still need confirmation that I have, hopefully, worked myself out of my conundrum (not deeper). "
2337,Solar luminosity proportional to $G^7$?,"A book I recently purchased describes Dirac's proposed variation of Newton's G, and why that specific proposal wouldn't work because the earth would have been too hot for the known history of life. A footnote explains that the luminosity of the sun is proportional to the seventh power of G, which seems incredible to me. I know that this has to be a simplification, since stellar dynamics are annoyingly complex, but if we put that aside, is this essentially correct, or is it a typo? What would be the theoretical justification for this in broad terms? (eg, ""Gravitational pressure is proportional to this exponent of G, but since that also shrinks the size of the star, which increases the pressure, it's actually this exponent of G, and the rate of fusion is proportional to the gravitational pressure squared, so you end up with 7""). "
2338,"If the universe is 'flat', what shape is it?","As in the title, If the universe is considered to be 'flat', what shape is it?  Is it a disc, elliptical, square, rectangle?  Or is this still unknown as we can only study a small segment of the entire universe, known as the observable universe?    EDIT  This previous related question did ask the same thing. However the OP was also asking about if the universe had a centre and if everything (galaxies, dust, stuff etc...) was evenly spread out only along the outer edges.   As far as I understand it, the Big Bang that started everything off isn't a typical 'explosion' with a central point. Shapley noted that it appeared as if galaxies are moving away from the Milky Way. We now realise that it is the space between galaxies that is expanding (and that we are not the centre of the universe). in 1998, Hubble then found that the far distant galaxies appear to be moving faster than closer galaxies. This means that the rate of expansion is accelerating. This acceleration rate is known as the Hubble constant.      I feel as if the answers focussed more on his sub questions. I found the comments to be more helpful than the answers.   Can I assume that the answer is still as summarized in the related questions comments?  'We don't know?'  Astromax commented on the question,     Well, it is indeed flat, meaning Euclidean geometry can be used. Since light travels at a finite rate and the universe is not infinitely old, our 'bubble' of observable stuff within the universe would be in the shape of a sphere centered on us. However, the center of the sphere would change if you decided to move to a different part of the universe. Is the universe infinite? This is not known, since we cannot see passed our observational horizon       Accepted Answer  To be honest I didn't understand the first half of the accepted answer, and having attempted to read through the Planck paper that was linked, I can tell you that I don't know much about astronomy! I kept getting lost in all the new (to me) astonomical terms being thrown about.   I read the second half of the accepted answer to be explaining that the universe has no centre.  Gerald commented on the OP's question about the shape 'shortly' after the big bang,     Something else: Roughly resembling the 3-dimensional surface of 4-dimensional sphere, but not quite symmetrical. The precise shape is not exactly known, but probably not too much distorted, like a torus, a cube or a dodecahedron. This is still under investigation; more precise results are expected within a few years, when polarization of the CMB will be analysed   and went further to clarify the linked Planck paper     Neither the circles-in-the-sky search nor the likelihood method ﬁnd evidence for a multiply-connected topology"" of the Planck paper, section 6.1 means it's not a torus-like or more complex object with holes.       Second Answer  The more popular second answer, definitely focussed more on answering the 'does the universe have a centre?' question.   Helpful comments to my focus, Astromax commented      Also, that the universe is ""infinite"" is not something anyone can prove. The expansion of space-time seems to occur everywhere, but that does not mean that the universe is infinite.   Stan Lou commented      Being infinite doesn't imply having no boundary (not by itself, at least).    and ended with      Yes, a flat 3-torus is a possible geometry, but the geometry does not have to be ""repetitive"" in the sense of wrapping around on itself. It doesn't have to be a torus. Beyond the horizon could be a Euclidean space instead of a flat torus. Or there could be pink unicorns. Or anything else. The point of the horizon is that we don't know what's beyond it. (But if one assumes that the universe is globally isotropic, then it can't be a torus.)   And the OP summarised it by saying      So it seems like it boils down to this: It's probably flat, probably 3D. It might be edge-less, or not, we don't know. If yes, might be hypertorus and we could eventually do a round trip and came to starting point. If not, might be a ball, or anything else. We don't know, and can't imagine because of our limited scope. Is this at least remotely aligned with today's theories or are there still some gapping holes?   The comments then end, as they moved the discussion to chat.  Can I assume that the answer is still as summarized. 'We don't know?' "
2339,Why is twilight longer in summer than winter and shortest at the equinox,"I recently decided to set my alarm clock to wake me up when it is ""dark"" out.  In the end, I decided to set my clock to the earliest time that nautical sunrise is in my state (Illinois) and stick with that all year.  While doing some research for this, I noticed something that surprised me.  Check out this disparity between astronomical sunrise to civil sunrise for the solstices and equinox (the latter two adjusted for daylight saving time):  Date/Astronomical/Civil/Disparity   Dec 20: 0533 - 0640 (67 minutes) Mar 20: 0526 - 0630 (64 minutes) Jun 20: 0320 - 0451 (91 minutes)   To be honest, these sets of ranges surprise me for multiple reasons.  I clearly don't know what I don't know, but here are some questions I can formulate:   Why would twilight be longer in summer than winter?  Before seeing this data, I had assumed that since the sun makes a more perpendicular path through the horizon in summer that twilight would be shorter in summer than in winter.  After all, in winter the sun takes a ""slanted"" path across the horizon.  Wouldn't the summer's path be more direct and therefore quicker? OK: seeing this empirical evidence I conclude that something is wrong with my premise that forms my first question.  Summer twilight is longer in summer than winter.  However, I still would have assumed that March 20 would have had a twilight length in between the two solstices.  But it's not!  Why does the equinox have the shortest twilight?      Appended 5/13/2014:  I didn't want to leave my original incorrect statement in here without flagging it. As Cheekhu points out below, the sun does not follow a more perpendicular path in summer than winter, as I had erroneously assumed and stated above.  See his post for more details. "
2340,Could there be dark matter black holes?,"Could dark matter compress and form black holes? Since dark matter is even more abundant than normal matter, a dark matter black hole should not be rare...right? "
2341,Explosions of black holes,"I was bopping around YouTube and observed this enjoyably produced video. In it, when describing the behavior of a black hole with the mass of a US nickel, the narrator says, ""Its 5 grams of mass will be converted to 450 terajoules of energy, which will lead to an explosion roughly three times bigger than the bombs dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki combined.""  Of all the fun things illustrated there, that was the one whose pretense I didn't understand. Do black holes explode after they've radiated away all of their mass? Or would the ""explosion"" just come from the rapid pace at which the black hole would consume nearby matter?  The Googling I've done thus far has provided no firm answer. The closest I've come is from the Wikipedia page on Hawking Radiation, which states, ""For a black hole of one solar mass, we get an evaporation time of 2.098 × 10^67 years—much longer than the current age of the universe at 13.799 ± 0.021 x 10^9 years. But for a black hole of 10^11 kg, the evaporation time is 2.667 billion years. This is why some astronomers are searching for signs of exploding primordial black holes.""  Some other websites refer to the last ""explosion"" of the Milky Way's supermassive black hole being some 2 million years ago, but is that the same mechanic mentioned on the Wikipedia page? Or the YouTube video, for that matter?  Thanks in advance. =) "
2342,Strange bright light in the sky flying fast,"I was out with my dad on our porch watching the stars with our telescope. after awhile of looking and taking pictures I noticed something strange in the sky. There were two airplanes flying close to each other, but next to those two airplanes was a very bright light (see how the stars are bright? Well that one was a lot bigger and I lot brighter, and to give you an example it was moving as fast as the planes, I showed my dad and he as well saw it, so I knew I wasn’t dreaming, it wasn’t moving straight either, both me and my dad could see it was going in zigzags, not a straight line, it desapeared after awhile behind he trees, we didn’t get to look at it through the telescope since it was moving so fast...what could it be...? Both me and my dad agree it was going as fast as the planes next to it, it was brighter then both the planes and the stars and it could not have been a third plane since broth planes were just so small and it looked like a very big star. FINALY it was not moving in a straight line...so the what would it be...?   "
2343,What would happen if a planet is removed from the solar system?,"More exactly what would to happen to us/Earth in general if any of the gas giants is removed by magic from the solar system ?

2345,How can a black hole ever form?,"We know that an object falling to the black hole, as observed from an observer far away, will freeze as it gets closer and closer to the event horizon. So my question is how can a black hole form in the first place? I mean we usually say thing a star collapses into a blackhole. But considering the effect of ""time-freezing"", how could that be possible in the first place? "
2346,Detect Passage of Massive Relativistic Object,"I came across an interesting article that speculates that we could detect an object of significant mass (""space-ship size"") moving through our galactic neighborhood at a substantial fraction of the speed of light with existing technology.  That got me wondering (for a sci-fi novel I'm writing) whether there would be evidence of such passage near the point in space where it occurred years or decades after such passage far from any star.  The CMB interactions mentioned in the article would spread from the point of passage at the speed of light so would have long departed the area. Is it likely that some artifact of passage would still be present, such as a change to the interstellar medium (change to ionization rates, fusion of lighter elements, etc)? How quickly would any such changes disperse? For purposes of the question, assume that scientific observations are possible at the point of suspected passage. "
2347,How many earths fit in the observable universe?,"I was pondering our insignificance, when I wondered - how much smaller is our planet then the (observable) universe?

2351,"What exactly is a ""moon""?","Recently some new moons of Jupiter were discovered. However the moons are pretty damn small indeed - only a few kilometers wide. That makes me wonder if they should even be called moons in the first place. The Wikipedia article on natural satellites says there's no clear lower limit (or upper limit for that matter). But if we accept that, then Jupiter already has countless numbers of moons in its ring system, and even the Earth has multiple moons since the International Space Station is a ""moon"".  What exactly is a moon? Is it really a vague notion of ""something that goes around a planet""? If so, why hasn't the IAU clarified what exactly a moon is? They've already done so for planets; it seems natural to do so for moons as well. "
2352,"How does the Hubble Space Telescope ""Drift and Shift""?","The Phys.org article Mystery of the universe's expansion rate widens with new Hubble data says:     Astronomers have been using Cepheid variables as cosmic yardsticks to gauge nearby intergalactic distances for more than a century. But trying to harvest a bunch of these stars was so time-consuming as to be nearly unachievable. So, the team employed a clever new method, called DASH (Drift And Shift), using Hubble as a ""point-and-shoot"" camera to snap quick images of the extremely bright pulsating stars, which eliminates the time-consuming need for precise pointing.      ""When Hubble uses precise pointing by locking onto guide stars, it can only observe one Cepheid per each 90-minute Hubble orbit around Earth. So, it would be very costly for the telescope to observe each Cepheid,"" explained team member Stefano Casertano, also of STScI and Johns Hopkins. ""Instead, we searched for groups of Cepheids close enough to each other that we could move between them without recalibrating the telescope pointing. These Cepheids are so bright, we only need to observe them for two seconds. This technique is allowing us to observe a dozen Cepheids for the duration of one orbit. So, we stay on gyroscope control and keep 'DASHing' around very fast.""   I understand that the technique skips the use of guide stars, but I'm wondering exactly what does happen. What does the word recalibrating mean in ""..move between them without recalibrating the telescope pointing...""   Do they just execute a blind change in direction using Hubble's attitude control system of gyros and reaction wheels, expose, and move on to the next field, and hope the target object was imaged?  For a little background see Hubble's one-gyro mode; how does it work for attitude control, stabilization, and slewing? and answer(s). "
2353,Does Earth revolves around Milky Way?,"As we know Earth rotates around Sun and Sun around Milky Way but then Sun must have some velocity/angular momentum (I don't know that much physics terms).  So as Earth revolves around Sun, it must adjust its orbit as Sun also revolves.  Is it so? Or am I missing something? "
2354,"Was the progress of astronomy in the 1800s surprisingly slow, and if so why?","The 1800's was a century of fantastic scientific discoveries in chemistry, geology, biology, engineering and so on.  Is it correct to say that astronomy did not keep up with this development? And if so, why? If not, what might be some main reasons for me (and others) having this impression?  The late 1700's saw a couple of revolutions in astronomy such as the discovery of Uranus as the first non-antique planet and the measurement of solar system distances thanks to the transits of Venus. As I understand it, the next big leaps in astronomy came in the early 1900's with the HR-diagram and the ""discovery"" of galaxies and more. The view of the universe did not seem to change much between 1800 and 1900. Nowadays every decade has its revolution such as inflation, dark matter, dark energy, exoplanets.  Spectroscopy, optics, photography, Doppler effect, and electricity all developed greatly during the 1800's but don't seem to have brought any revolution to astronomy until later. Is relativity and quantum physics behind this new flourishing? Had the Newtonian physics reached its limit for potentially revolutionizing astronomy already about year 1800? Or was astronomy just out of fashion, maybe because of more profitable employment for the brightest brains in the age of industrialization? "
2355,"Difference between ""planetary ring"" and ""circumstellar disk""?","   Related: Do/Can Ringed Stars Exist?   Is there any particular difference, in behavior or properties, between a planetary ring system and a circumstellar disk? Or is the only real difference a matter of what's in the middle?  This question came up as a matter in the related discussion, particularly because the (game-simulated) object that inspired the question is a brown dwarf - something between a star and a gas giant. What I observed in-game appeared to be more similar to the rings around Saturn, than to the description and image provided of a circumstellar disk.  So, are there properties of the rings/disks themselves which can differentiate one type from another? Or is the type of central body the only thing that defines them?  If the central body is the only factor, what should we call a ring around a brown dwarf, assuming one could exist in nature? "
2356,What determines the surface material of the ALMA and Spitzer telescope?,"The transition between metal dish and mirror happens around hundreds of microns.

My questions is what determines the surface material of the ALMA and Spitzer telescope? Could a metal dish observe shorter wavelength than a mirror telescope? "
2357,where to obtain ephemeris data for geodesy satellites?,"Is anyone aware of where one can obtain ephemeris data in Geocentric Celestial Reference Systems (GCRS) coordinates for a geodesy satellite such as LAGEOS (It doesn't really matter which mission)? Or, alternatively, simulated data in GCRS coordinates. Specifically, Cartesian position and velocity coordinates. I can't seem to find them anywhere.   Update: My confusion has increased. I will try and rephrase my question.  Is it possible to obtain an ephemeris file and perform a transformation such that the ephemeris data can be expressed in GCRS coordinates? And if so, what is the process?  Purpose of question: What I am interested in is ephemeris data for a satellite (doesn't really matter which mission) that is subject to classical Newtonian acceleration plus relativistic corrections as recommended by the IERS such as Schwarzschild, Lense-Thirring and Geodetic accelerations.

2360,Is a wavy path possible for a shooting star?,"I was camping recently (May 2014), and observed several shooting stars (very fast, short lived), a few satellites (very slow, long lived) and lots of aircraft (flashing lights) in the night sky.  All of the shooting stars appeared normal, as very fast streaks across the sky, which disappeared within a fraction of a second. All except one. One started fairly straight as normal, then took a completely unexpected wavy path (like releasing a balloon to fly around the room) towards the end of its flight. Then it winked out. What caused this?  Note, I was completely sober at the time, the sky was clear, and I believe this could not have been an aircraft or satellite because of its tremendous speed. Apart from this 'meteor', there was nothing else in the sky which could be interpreted as a firework.  Could this really have been a meteor, and what could have made it take this path? If not a meteor, what else could it have been?  (Note: I have tagged this 'UFO' because I'm not sure I can identify this object, not because I think it's an alien space craft). "

2364,Is the age of the universe relative to an observer's location in that universe?,"According to Wiki the age of the universe is 13 billion years old, and I was taught that background radiation made the universe uniform in all directions.  Doesn't this define a sphere of space in the universe with Earth at the center? This sphere would have a radius of 13 billion light years.  We (on Earth) could not see anything outside this sphere. As light did not exist more than 13 billion years ago. So for us this defines some kind of edge for the universe.  But what happens when an alien in another galaxy 5 billion light years away from Earth also looks towards the stars. Don't they see a uniform background radiation and measure the same age of the universe?  That alien would also have a sphere of 13 billion years.  So we have two spheres, one for Earth and one for our alien friend.  These two spheres would overlap each other by 5 billion years. Which means, if we look in the opposite direction from that alien's galaxy. We can see an additional 5 billion years further than they can.  If we measure the total width of the two overlapping spheres we get a distance of 18 billion light years.  I now grasp my hair in confusion. Is this possible that two visible spheres could overlap to create a distance longer than the oldest ray of light? And from there I fall into more questions. Can two people measure the same universe age from different spots in the universe.  That's why I think my idea is is wrong, but how could it be wrong and why? "
2365,Did the Babylonians believe in the Heliocentric version?,"It's mentioned that the Babylonians decreed that there were exactly 360 days in a year. This statement was based upon the utilization of 360 as a standard (based on the sexagesimal system) i.e., they divided the circle into 360 equal parts. Although, there is a mention about the Sun making one full circle across the sky in one year (as estimated by them), but, how were they able to measure it? And did they believe in the Heliocentric version of the solar system? "
2366,Have caged molecules ever been observed in space?,"astrosnapper@'s thorough answer to the question What is precipitable water vapor in millimeter-wave radioastronomy and how is it measured? links to the paper Observing Conditions for Submillimeter Astronomy which discusses spectral windows of atmospheric transmission in the 100 ~ 1500 GHz range. These windows are ""delineated"" or limited by strong absorption lines of molecular water vapor in the atmosphere.   Figure 2 is shown below. The caption reads     Fig. 2.

2369,Does matter accumulate just outside the event horizon of a black hole?,"My understanding is that time slows and approaches stopping when approaching the event horizon of a black hole.  I have seen this explained several places, including a brief explanation in the last paragraph under: [website]  Oppenheimer and his co-authors interpreted the singularity at the boundary of the Schwarzschild radius as indicating that this was the boundary of a bubble in which time stopped. This is a valid point of view for external observers, but not for infalling observers. Because of this property, the collapsed stars were called ""frozen stars"",[17] because an outside observer  would see the surface of the star frozen in time at the instant where its collapse takes it inside the Schwarzschild radius.   Does this mean then that no matter actually falls into a black hole (except possibly what was there at its formation)?  Would this also mean matter is accumulating just outside its event horizon?  As I understand it, this would be the perspective from outside the black hole.  If this is the case, I wonder if we would observe a tremendous amount of matter surrounding the event horizon, but it would be extremely red shifted?  Edit:  I noticed an answer to a different question, especially the end portion, provides some insight here as well: [website]Edit:  These YouTube videos someone put together explain the concept very well, and seem to indicate this idea is gaining traction!  [website][website]Edit:  This new YouTube video describes this idea very well, and describes it as the way black holes work!  [website]"
2370,How to calculate the integrated source flux density of a continuous source?,"I'm working with data from radio surveys. My images are .fits files with BUNIT Jy/beam. I want to calculate the net flux from a continuous source (not point source). When I simply added all the intensity values and converted it into Jy using the beam parameters, my professor said that it is not enough. He said, ""You have to account for noise by taking 3 or 4-sigma level depending on the distribution of the noise"". The distribution of noise (at places other than the source) is nearly Gaussian as I can see from a fits viewer.  By ""take 3-sigma level"", does he mean that I should fit a Gaussian to the noise, find sigma and then choose the pixels with intensity values greater than 3*sigma? If I do this, obviously I lose a lot of pixels. Also, if this is correct, should I subtract the mean of intensity of ""noise"" pixels from my source intensity?  An RMS noise is given in the header, with a caution that it varies highly around some sources. Is this RMS noise value in anyway related to the sigma that I calculated earlier? "

2372,Where do local users of ALMA live and work?,"These days with high speed internet, observational astronomy can be done from remote locations. Still I believe from time to time an experimenter might travel to work on-site for particularly challenging or unusual/non-standard observations, where working closely with the instrument support team is necessary.  When astronomers travel to the Atacama Large Millimeter Array or ALMA:   Where do they live? Where do they work during observing sessions?   Representative photos would be greatly appreciated!  I'm guessing it looks a little different than this:    Source: Cropped from Apertif - the focal-plane array system for the WSRT     Figure 2.

2373,What (actually) is Jupiter doing to this year's Perseids meteor shower?,"After reading the Astronomy Magazine article Perseid meteor shower set for its best show in nearly 20 years and NASA's Look Up! Perseid Meteor Shower Peaks Aug. 11-12, I understand that Jupiter's gravity is affecting this year's possible peak rate of Perseid's meteors.   I think it is - in simple terms - deflecting some of them out of their general orbit, a bit more towards earth, so that we intercept more than usual. But I am having difficulty visualizing this. Is this deflection in the plane of the ecliptic, or out of plane? At our closest approach, how far away are we from the orbit of this dust?  A good diagram would really help!  I found this at space.com credited to Jeremie Vaubaillon, but it's not helping me with the 'big picture'.    Also found this here and credited to NASA/JPL:   "

2375,Does Absolute Velocity Exist?,"It seems everyone is on the same page about there being no ""absolute velocity"" due to the fact that everything is relativistic. However, this leaves me confused. This seems to be disconnected with the concept that the speed of light is in fact an unchanging constant. But to state that all speed is relative to an object is to essentially say, ""speed does not exist, but is only relative to an observer"". But yet, the speed of light is a calculable constant that never changes. How then, can we say, there is no such thing as absolute speed?  If I throw a flashlight in space that is turned on 50mph, does the speed of the emitted light from the flashlight increase by 50 miles per hour in the direction I threw it? Of course not. We know this. But if this is truly the case, how then can there not be an absolute velocity which could be calculated by determining the speed of light in relevance to the object we're measuring (since the speed of light is constant)?  Please help because this is bothering me. "
2376,Using the surface-brightness relation for Cepheids,"I'm a high school student who is doing research about Cepheid variables.   I'm in the process of deriving distance to Cepheid using the Baade-Wesselink method, which utilises the surface brightness relation. The surface brightness relation is used to derive angular diameter variation of the cepheid from its V-K band data in this method. I found the equation relating angular diameter and the V-K band of Cepheid variables from the research paper The projection factor, period-radius relation, and surface-brightness colour relation in classical cepheids, which is apparently:  [tex]  My question is, to derive the angular diameter variation what kind of raw data that I should use for V-K band? May I directly use the maximum V-K value and minimum V-K value and put them into the equation individually, and interpret their difference as an angular diameter variation? Or do I need to get lists of V-K band value varying over time and put it into the equation to get angular diameter variation over time and graphically measure the maximum and minimum angular diameter variation?

2379,How many science instruments can be used in parallel with the Hubble Space Telescope?,"The Hubble Space Telescope offers a parallel obervation mode. Observing programmes such as CANDELS and CLASH use WFC3 and ACS in parallel fields. These are also the only instruments of which I have heard that they are being used in parallel. Here are my questions:  Is it possible to observe with more than two instruments in parallel? If so, what is the limit, and why?  Why aren't all observations done with as many instruments as possible turned on?  Granted, a lot of the data would be useless / difficult to analyze (like spectra of a random patch of sky), but on the other hand it might lead to serendipitous discoveries. HST won't last forever, so why not get the most use possible out of it?  Note that this is about the science instruments - I assume the guidance sensors will be working alongside the others anyway. (Or is that wrong?) "
2380,Integrating radial velocity with respect to time,"I'm a highschool student who is writing a research paper about plotting Period-Luminosity graph of the Cepheid variables by deriving distance through independent method such as trigonometric parallax and Baade-Wesselink method: [tex]  While trying to understand and use the Baade-Wesselink method, I faced some difficulties in terms of calculating linear radius variation. According to some papers, I need to integrate radial velocity with respect to time to get the linear radius variation from [tex] to [tex], where [tex] [tex] its period.  I got the linear radial velocity from the SIMBAD database. For example, for the V* AQ Pup (one of classical Cepheids), its radial velocity is 56.9km/s. Then how do I integrate this value from [tex] to [tex]? Does this mean [56.9t]^t_t0 and after all [tex]?  And also, may I ask how can I get the value of [tex] and [tex]? Does this mean ""proper motion"" in here?  "
2381,Are there any mirrors in space?,"We have encountered galaxies that act as lenses, magnifying the light coming from behind them. This is super fascinating and it makes me wonder what other optic tools we might have at our disposal.  The question of what we know about our own galaxy is obviously fascinating because it's kind of the the one we have the worst view at. There's so much noise around us it's hard to get a macroscopic view of the galaxy. It occurs to me that if we could stick a mirror out and look at our galaxy from the outside, maybe we have a better view.   Of course, we don't have the technology to make a very useful mirror. And it wouldn't be very efficient. If anything, we would simply launch a probe out there and send back pictures and science data.  But then I got to thinking maybe there's a naturally occurring mirror we could leverage. We know there are entities that can bend light, are there any that bounce it? It would be incredibly advantageous if there was one that allowed us to see our own galaxy, but also it seems unlikely. But are there -any- objects out there that reflect light like a mirror allowing us to see around them or behind them or their ""backside""? "
2382,Can we discern black holes with visible light?,"Sorry for my dumb terms. I'm interrested in astronomy but I have next to zero background.  Given that a black hole absorbs everything, including light, could we ever discern one with visible light (and live to pass the information on)?  This question contains one generated picture of a black hole and Google image shows visual representations that all look similar (black circle in the centre, light that's distorted around it and the further we go away from the center the background is less and less distorted), but are those actually representative? Is there really a black spot in our vision field at the place where the black hole is? Both the answer to the question and this page discards such images as ""fantasy"", but they don't really answer the questions I'm asking, which are:   Will we ever be able to discern a black hole with visible light and live? If we can, what is a currently acceptable description of what we'll see with visible light? I don't especially expect a picture, so a textual description is also good, but keep in mind it's in regards to visible light. Other questions on Astronomy SE explain what we can ""detect"" using radio waves or other means of observation. In 2014-2015 CERN said they might be creating micropscopic short-lived (10-27 seconds) black holes with the LHC (and this lead to a global nonsensical fear that it'd destroy the planet). Did they create any? If yes, was there any opportunity to picture them despite their tiny size and short life?  "
2383,how steady over time are right ascension and declination values?,"I understand that astronomers use right ascension and declination for the position of stars. However both these values strike me as very anthropocentric and, more importantly, unreliable over time as I understand that the Earth wobbles a bit over time so the celestial equator shifts and I guess Sun's rotation around the galaxy and Milky Way's own trajectory should play a role in depreciating the accuracy of those values over time.  So my questions are:  [1] how steady are right ascension and declination values for distant stars over time?  [2] is there a more stable coordinate system or do we lack an absolutely fixed frame of reference? "
2384,(How) Can one determine if an exoplanet is synchronously tidally locked or not?,"Mercury is asynchronously tidally locked so that all of its surface regularly sees the Sun. But an exoplanet which is synchronously locked to its star, could we tell that it is? It would have a hot side and a cold side. This should affect transit and occultation on some wavelengths, but does the symmetry of the movement degenerate any possibility to disentangle tidal locking from that?  Mercury seems to cool down during night time, and gas giants maybe distribute their temperature atmospherically. So their tidal locking might be hard to discern. But there are terrestrial exoplanets with much shorter orbital period which should have a cool side and a hot side permanently. That's my speculation. My basic curiosity is:  Is Mercury a freak or a standard in terms of tidally locked planets being asynchronously so? And by observational support, not just models. "
2385,When does oscillation of interplanetary plasma occurs?,When does oscillation of interplanetary plasma occur?

2386,Trouble with plotting a graph for the Planck function,"Here is my problem statement:  For a temperature of [tex], make a graph of the Plank function (Eq. 3.24), plotting [tex] vs [tex] for [tex] between 15.5 and 17.5. How does the behaviour of your graph of a blackbody compare with that of Fig. 28.14 for the continuous spectrum of the quasar 3C 273?  Here is the equation 3.24  \begin{equation}     B_\nu (T) = \frac{2h \nu^3/c^2}{e^{h\nu/kT}-1}. \end{equation}  I have put together an excel spreadsheet and created a graph of [tex] vs [tex], however, it is just a straight line (which is what I would have expected although the graph in the book is significantly different). I am wondering if I am misunderstanding the problem statement. What I did to get my data points for [tex] is I first computed [tex] values from the given range of [tex] values, then I computed B(T) values with the above-given equation. Then I substituted the product into logarithm : [tex], thus obtaining my [tex] values. and then I plotted it against  [tex]. Am I doing things wrong or is this fine? "
2387,"If you lived on the far side of the Moon, how could you infer the existence of Earth?","Suppose that you deposit an astronomer, armed with our current knowledge of orbital mechanics, on a dome on the far side of the Moon, so that the Earth is perpetually hidden from them.   (And, of course, assume that this person has no specific knowledge about the system they're in beyond what they can glean from observations. If you will, imagine that they learned all our modern orbital mechanics and related physics in alpha centauri, and then got teleported to our Moon.)  Now, it is reasonable to expect that this person should be able to deduce from observations of the sky that the body they are on is one half of a binary system, and they should be able to measure the orbital characteristics (semi-major axis, ellipticity, inclination) as well as the  position of the barycentre (much closer to the other body, corresponding to a much more massive partner). What observations are needed to deduce this? What level of observational accuracy is needed for those observations, and to what historical epoch does it correspond to? (I.e. would Tycho Brahe's kit have been sufficient? Would Galileo's? Would the ancient Greeks'? Or would this require a late-19th-century (or even later) observatory?)    (As pointed out in MartinV's answer, our astronomer might find it hard to distinguish between situations with an orbiting pair vs one single huge body. Thus, if convenient, you can assume that, via short ~100km forays from the dome, our astronomer is able to measure the lunar radius by measuring solar inclinations at different points with known distances between them, à la Erathostenes.)

2390,Should we not accommodate Ophiuchus also in Our Calendar?,"We have only 12 months in our calendar and only as many Zodiac signs as the number of months in a year. Now that we know there are 13 constellations should we not have 13 months in the calendar instead of 12 months and have 13 Zodiac Signs by adding a sign for Ophiuchus as well in the following manner?   If we have 13 months in a year, each month consisting of 28 days, we would have neat 4 weeks a month round the year which would obviously make life much easier.   But 13 months multiplied with 28 makes it only 364 days a year. So we would have to have one extra day besides 13 months each year. We may call it by any name. It could be even Xmas day or just any other day for a non-leap year. During leap years we would have to have two extra days instead of one day.   At present the period of Capricorn starts on Dec 22 and ends on Jan 19. Likewise other Zodiac periods also start from such staggered dates of various months and end on odd dates only. If we may have 13 months and may allow a year to start from Dec 22 instead of Jan 1 we would be able to resolve this anomaly also because then each Zodiac sign would begin on the 1st of each month and would end on the last day of each month only.   The way we switched over from the British system of miles, fathoms, yards,feet and inches to the metric system all over the world this reform would also obviously facilitate everybody's life enormously.    So should we not set the ball rolling to reform our calendar as conceived by me?     Deborah Houlding in her post “Understanding the Zodiac: and why there really are 12 zodiac signs” at [website]""Ophiuchus is not a new constellation, it was catalogued with many others in Ptolemy's 2nd-century treatise, Almagest, (an astronomical text of huge historical standing), where it is referred to as Septentarius, ""the serpent holder"". It was always realised that the ecliptic cuts through a small part of this constellation, but it is a very large constellation, the majority of which the zodiac fails to embrace, so it was not considered a ""zodiac constellation"".""   They knew that there were as many as 17 constellations including Ophiuchus but had deliberately chosen only twelve of them because 360 degrees could have not been equally divided into `13 sections. It indirectly implies had there been 390 degrees in a circle they would have perhaps included Ophiuchus also. Why was it necessary to divide the circle into equal widths at all? Some Zodiacs were known to cover smaller sections than the others. They could have as well accommodated even all the 17 constellations by allotting them actual widths instead of equal widths as has been done now for 13 constellations. So we may say the fact that they thought of allotting equal widths to all Zodiacs was the main culprit.   Just have a look at the current distribution, shown below.  1 ARIES = APRIL 19 – MAY 13    … 25 days 2 TAURUS = MAY 14 – JUNE 19   …  37 days 3 GEMINI = JUNE 20 – JULY 20     … 31 days 4 CANCER = JULY 21 – AUG 9    …. 21 days 5 LEO = AUGUST 10 – SEPTEMBER 15   …  37 days 6 VIRGO = SEPTEMBER 16 – OCTOBER 30    … 45 days 7 LIBRA = OCTOBER 31 – NOVEMBER 22   …  23 days  8 SCORPIO = NOVEMBER 23 – NOVEMBER 29  … 7 days  9 OPHIUCHUS = NOVEMBER 30 – DECEMBER 17  … 18 days  10 SAGITTARIUS = DECEMBER 18 – JANUARY 18  … 31 days 11 CAPRICORN = JANUARY 19 – FEBRUARY 15   … 28 days 12 AQUARIUS = FEBRUARY 16 – MARCH 11    …  24 days (in non-leap years) and 25  days (in the leap years)  13 PISCES = MARCH 12 – APRIL 18  ..  38 days  (Source: www.cool-story.com)  How nicely 365 days of the non-leap years and 366 days of the leap years have been assigned to the 13 Zodiacs?   However, as of now even if we had 13 sidereal months a year, each month of 28 days, each Zodiac would obviously not stretch over full month any way. So by having 28 days’ months and 13 months a year we would be benefited only to the extent that each month would have precisely 4 weeks while it is not so under the Gregorian calendar of 12 synodic months.

2392,Why do we think that there is no two-solar-mass black hole?,"We think that the mass boundary between neutron stars and stellar mass black holes is  around three solar masses.   The maximum mass of the neutron stars now is two solar masses and we may find a 2.6 solar mass neutron star in the future. That is based on the equation of state.  The stellar mass black holes may have different origins. Even the smallest stellar mass black hole originates in SN explosion,  we do not know the details of the explosion.  Why do not we think a two solar mass BH, or even a smaller BH, could exist?  Why do we think that the companion of Taylor-Hulse binary is a neutron star instead of a BH?  "

2394,Is the equinox Sun always at the same zodiac sign in the ecliptic belt?,"During the year the Sun moves along the ecliptic passing all the signs of the zodiac belt, in my understanding. This means that it takes ~1 month to go from one zodiac sign to the next.    The equinoxes are approximately on 20th of March and 23rd of September. This means the vernal equinox Sun is in Pisces (or Aries) and the autumnal equinox Sun is in Libra (or Virgo).    But also I found that there is the observation of precession of the equinoxes, where the equinox Sun passes through all zodiac signs in a calendar round that lasts ~25,000 years.    How is this possible?     If my understanding about the Sun's yearly round across the zodiac is correct, the equinox Sun should always be at the same zodiac signs. How can this precession happen? "

2401,Are the darker blue/black areas in this picture what the atmosphere of Jupiter looks like without clouds?,"This is a picture (mosaic?) of Jupiter's south pole taken by Juno (also shown below). It has gotten a lot of press, but I haven't seen anything, even in the scientific paper that accompanied its release, that answers the first question that came to mind when I saw it : is this a view into the inside of Jupiter? I seem to recall seeing IR images of Jupiter where the poles appear quite hot, which would be consistent with a ""clear sky"" providing a view of deeper, hotter layers. But how deep can see in this picture?    Edit: I am aware that this is a visible light image, and that visible light does not penetrate the cloud layer of Jupiter.  My question is whether part of the south pole of Jupiter is cloud-free, at least to a depth where atmospheric extinction limits our ability to see the clouds. This interpretation of the picture would assume that blue light penetrates deeper than red light into the atmosphere (clouds not included) of Jupiter, and that this is the reason that some of the clouds, presumed to be deeper, look blue, while some areas between them are essentially black.  Here is an example of a picture of Jupiter in IR, which shows the poles as being relatively hot. The troposphere of Jupiter (or any planet) is generally hotter the deeper you go, so the poles appearing hotter is consistent with less cloud cover at the poles. [  I'm aware that perhaps no-one, including the Juno team, knows the answer to my question. Some useful partial answers would include an estimate of the depth to which visible light could penetrate Jupiter's atmosphere in the absence of clouds, and whether blue light would penetrate deeper than red.

Nodding to these bodies I label the central mass S, orbiting mass J and the L4 mass T:    It's said S/J needs to be equal to or greater than 24.96 for the system to be stable.

A spinning disc with a face that is 118 billion kilometres across and if so what are the other measurements?  Am I thinking about this all wrong with regards to trying to understand it as a shape at all? If I understand correctly, mass doesn't give any indication of size as it is dependent on density. Is a black hole just basically a somewhat spherical body of mass like any other that just has an absolutely massive density and spin? "
2414,Distance of extra-galactic Classical Cepheids,"There have been many questions and answers about finding the distance of a star from the earth. But as I did some research on the net, I found that we have specific approaches for finding the distances of different types of stars.   So, my question is more specific now.   How to determine how far a Classical Cepheid is?  What if the Cepheid is extra-galactic? Is there a good method to finding the solution? Can anybody suggest how to make a start at deriving a relation at finding the distance of a Cepheid from us?  There is this Period-Luminosity-Color relation. Can anyone at least enlist the journal articles where I can make a study to get closer to finding the answer to my question? "
2415,What is the optimal escape trajectory from near a black hole?,"Consider a space ship that is being drawn closer to a black hole.  The crew begins to notice the effects, and discovers that they are nearing the black hole.  They then manage to halt their progression toward the black hole.  What would be the optimal escape trajectory, assuming they have not yet wandered too close?  I am thinking it would likely either be directly away from the black hole (figure 1), or parallel to the black hole (figure 2).  However, it is conceivable that there would be some other angle that would be optimal (e.g. 45 degrees in figure 3).  Figure 1: Go directly away from the black hole    Figure 2: Go ""parallel"" to the black hole    Figure 3: Go 45 degrees from the black hole    A follow up question is, would this answer be the same for other high gravity objects, such as neutron stars, or even regular stars?  Let's say for simplicity sake that they have already managed to halt their advance toward the black hole and they are now still (not moving) in relation to the black hole. If distance factors in, it would be interesting to see what the answer is at different distances (e.g. fairly close to the event horizon where I realize a tremendous amount of energy would be required, and for far away). "
2416,In SETI has anyone calculated an estimate of the mean time between observations?,"So the Drake Equation, proposed by Frank Drake, is often cited as a means to estimate the number of intelligent civilizations that exist in the observable universe.   Initial calculations by Drake came up with a number of about 10,000 civilizations. But refinements in the equation on how to interpret, and updated data, have recently led to this evaluation published in Astrobiology Magazine:    ""There is a 75% chance we could find ET between 1,361 and 3,979 light-years away""  But what I'm more interested in has to do with our technology and efforts in detecting the first civilization in terms of estimating a mean time between observations.   Surely given the result of the Drake equation, our current efforts, and possibly other factors to consider such as sampling theory there must be a way to calculate this. Has anyone pursued this? If so what are the results? hours?, days? years? centuries?   Such a calculation I believe would justify more concerted efforts and investment or otherwise abandonment of any hope. Or perhaps a different strategy to mitigate the assumptions on the calculation to reduce the mean time. "

2418,How many stars are visible to naked eyes around Equator area?,"In the best sky conditions, we can see about 44,000 stars in the sky. But what if I am located around Equator area? How many stars I can see?   From what I know, the number of stars I can see should be far less ( I don't know why, though). Is it true? If yes, why? "
2419,Does liquid water on Mars means life?,"We need to figure if liquid water is present throughout a Mars year, and how long the planet has been at its current distance from Sun. That will give us the length of time that liquid water has been present.  We can then compare this with Earth's data to figure out how long life would have had to evolve and what state it may have reached. In particular would there have been enough time for humanoids to evolve?  Would the different composition of the atmosphere and surface gravity produce life that looks different to that on Earth today? "
2420,Exact measurement of a light year,"What is the exact measurement of a light year? I searched google for the answer in meters and came up with [tex] meters. When I calculated the answer considering [tex] as the speed of light, I came up with:  $$ 299\,792\,458 \times 365 \times 24 \times 3\,600 = 9\,454\,254\,955\,508\,926 \;\text{m} $$ Why is there such a gap? Did I miss something to add in the equation or is it just wrong? "

2422,"How deep is the ""A"" Fraunhofer line in the solar spectrum? Is it from the Sun's or Earth's atmosphere?","Question: Where can I see - or even download - a fairly high resolution (~0.1 nm) solar spectrum at zero air mass - in other words from space without absorption and other features from the Earth's atmosphere? Of particular interest is the near infrared around 750-780nm. Is the ""A"" Fraunhofer line due to absorption by oxygen in the Sun's atmosphere, or in Earth's?  The background discussion below shows some examples, but these are not directly from scientific sources and I have a hunch they are from observations on Earth's surface below the atmosphere.  Background:  Studies of photosynthesis on Earth using spectrometers in satellites measure solar flux induced fluorescence from foliage during the day, taking advantage of certain bands in the solar spectrum that are relatively ""dark"". GOME-2  For example, the Fraunhofer line labeled ""A"" below is produced by absorption by oxygen, but it is not clear to me if it is the oxygen in the Suns atmosphere or the Earth's atmosphere that's producing this line.   The images below are spectra of sunlight with various instruments of widely different resolutions, and because the absorption is narrow, the apparent depth is a function of resolution rather than reality.    above: a low resolution spectrum from here    above: An spectrogram of the Sun from this NOAO website (N.A.Sharp, NOAO/NSO/Kitt Peak FTS/AURA/NSF) with the ""A"" line near 760nm appearing near the top, a little right of center. The original data is from the ""Fourier Transform Spectrometer at the McMath-Pierce Solar Facility at the National Solar Observatory on Kitt Peak, near Tucson, Arizona"" but seems to be formatted and colorized to look like an Echelle spectrogram.  A video describing the use of the dark band for Earth science can be seen at [website]"
2423,What would happen if a rocket traveling at speed of light would collide with a planet (like earth)?,"Let's assume it is possible for a spacecraft to travel at the speed of light (I've read the interstellar book by Kip Thorne, apparently this is theoretically possible if you swing around two black holes)  I have watched the video where the traveling of a light particle is simulated and while planets are certainly big enough so you can adjust your route, what would happen if a rocket (or spaceship in general) would collide with an earth-like planet (i.e. a planet having a massive surface). Would we burst through the whole planet, make it only to a core, or just a few km? I know what happens when a meteor lands, but obviously they aren't traveling at the speed of light.  And one similar another question - when a spaceship is traveling at the speed of light, is there a problem with collision with smaller objects? I think you can't avoid millions of rockets in outer space, it would surely damage the spaceship, wouldn't it? "
2424,How to properly observe Solar Total Eclipse in 2019?,"I live in South America and I'm willing to travel to Chile in July 2019 to observe (in a curious way, not professional) the Solar Total Eclipse.  According to my research, one of the best cities to observe the eclipse is in the coastal city of La Serena at 3:20 PM Local Time. However, I don't know if it can be seen from ""anywhere"". I was thinking of observing it from the beach. Does that make sense?  I also know that I need some kind of special sunglasses for safety. I found some on Ebay but I don't know if they are authentic. I would appreciate if someone could point me to a website that sells authentic eclipse glasses for a reasonable price and international shipping.  In short, my question is, will I be able to amazingly see the eclipse by just traveling to La Serena and go to the beach on the specific day and time? Is there a better place to see it? Is it better to see it from a high ground? Any tips are welcome.  Thanks. "
2425,Does time dilation at the event horizon prevent us from seeing any changes?,"If gravity is so strong at event horizon as we assume, and thus time dilation makes time infinitely slow for us, the distant observers, how could we ever observe any events ocurring over time? Wouldn't we always see black holes as infinitely static? But then again, should a black hole evaporate, at which point would we observe any change as a result of this process? "
2426,Is it possible for redshift to be caused by light being somehow slowed down during travel?,"In other words, is the assumption, that redshift is caused by universe expansion, definitive? Or are other theories still being considered? Could it be, that light is being slowed down by dark energy, dark matter, massive objects, etc., as it travels through space?  "
2427,What's the bleeding-edge model for how Population III stars are born and evolve?,"I'm trying to do a brief literature review to find out what the best current models for population III stellar evolution are. I was hoping that someone with more expertise in the area could perhaps summarise or point me in the right direction.  This post on physics.SE is a great intro, but it's now over 4 years old.   Recent observations (see here and here) suggest hints of these kinds of stars at relatively low redshift (z ~ 6) - does this provide significant tension on current models? Have there been other observational hints? "
2428,What (actually) defines an Aten-class near-earth asteroid?,"I just read in the EarthSky.org article Hours after discovery, asteroid swept by that the near earth asteroid 2016 QA2 recently passed the earth at about 85,000 km. The article says that it is a member of the Aten group of asteroids. That article links to this very cool GIF [website]Wikipedia says:     Aten asteroids are defined by having a semi-major axis of less than one astronomical unit (AU), the distance from the Earth to the Sun. They also have an aphelion (furthest distance from the Sun) greater than 0.983 AU[tex].   [tex][website]That link shows the following table and drawings. The text says:     NEAs are divided into groups (Aten, Apollo, Amor) according to their perihelion distance (q), aphelion distance (Q) and their semi-major axes (a).   Are [tex] and [tex] really perihelion and aphelion respectively? The table says Aten asteroids have [tex] but in the drawing for Aten asteroids it says [tex]. I noticed these values could be reciprocals, so there may be something more going on here. But at least on the surface there seems to be some contradiction.  Could someone confirm these definitions with an external source - and help me understand the basis for these limits that deviate from 1 AU by only  +/- 1.7%?        The image below is from this explanation: Near Earth Asteroid / NEO Classifications Based on Locations. It might be helpful for discussion.       "

2431,Does all the exoplanets orbit the same direction?,"In one stellar system like our milkyway, all the planets orbits in the same direction. But are exoplanets orbitting in the same direction as we (earth) do, or is there a higher percentage which orbit in one or the other way? If so what could be the reason for that? "
2432,"Ideas about the origin of the ""black hole - galaxy mass"" relation?","It has been extensively shown that the mass of black-holes located at the center of galaxies scales with several galaxy properties, most notably the stellar velocity dispersion of the stellar bulge, which is an indicator of stellar mass. The origin of this relation remains controversial, and a leading candidate is AGN feedback.  However, new studies (e.g., Woo et al. 2019; [website]Therefore the question still remains: how such a correlation can exist? How the central BH 'knows' about galaxy mass (or viceversa)? "
2433,Could dark energy be negative gravity?,"Main question: Could dark energy (the mysterious accelerating expansion of the universe) be explained by ""negative gravity""?    ""Spin off"" questions:   Does antimatter have negative gravity?   If antimatter has negative gravity, and is present in the universe with equal amounts of matter and antimatter, would it produce the observed amount of dark energy in the universe?   My theory that I am trying to validate:  Gravity is the flow of space into matter, and it flows out of antimatter.  If this is true, antimatter should have ""negative gravity"", I would expect it to have a repelling effect, while matter has an attracting effect.  For example, if antimatter were on earth (somehow without annihilating), it would fall to the planet.  However, if there were an antimatter planet, objects would ""fall up"" off it.  In fact, I believe the antimatter planet would break apart because of this quality.  Furthermore, I don't believe antimatter planets or stars would form because of this quality (e.g. it would remain anti-hydrogen).  I also theorize that it would be in parts of the universe where matter isn't (e.g. in the voids outside the galactic clusters), and would be very diffuse (because it would repel itself).  I believe the theorized repelling effect of antimatter could be what we are observing as dark energy (hence why I am asking these questions).  I just searched for this online to see if anyone else has this theory, and yes, someone has something very similar here: [website]** Edit **  It seems others have caught on and simulated the idea of negative mass as dark energy in the universe.  They have run simulations with equal mass and negative mass and ended up with a result that resembles the current universe!  They say negative mass might also explain dark matter!  Check it out here: [website]This video also shows how negative mass might react: [website]"
2434,The laws of physics through out the universe,"How do we know laws of physics are the same throughout the universe? Intuitively I would say they would vary in two natural ways: the constants in the equations may vary or the math in the equations may vary. As a guess they could change over a long time. What is the furthest radius we can prove from earth, with absolute certainty, that the laws of physics do not vary? I am aware this may not be a radius but a more complex shape that cannot be simply described by a radius.  The nearest answer I can think of for a radius is a guess. And that guess is based on the furthest physics experiment we have done from earth. Which I think is an experiment with mirrors on the moon. Therefore if we assume (I don't know if this assumption is totally 100% reasonable) all physics laws hold because this experiment works. Then the radius is to the moon. This doesn't give an concrete answer for the radius, merely an educated guess. "
2435,Realistic space environments,"You've seen it in all kinds of science fiction, be it books, games, movies, and such. Space is depicted all sorts of ways, with asteroids far too close together, nebula thick enough to hide in and much more. Yet for a writer that want's to describe space accurately, this is a problem.   So I need stellar features and reasons why they would form/exist  Here's a rough list of what I'm talking about:   Thick asteroid style fields, averaging around 100 meters apart Nebula regions that are actually thick enough to obscure light, like clouds Dust cloud regions thick enough to obscure light Any other kind of cloud of material that's similar to the two above Naturally occurring fields of explosive gas or a physical material that does the same Radiation levels high enough to eat through ship plating Naturally occurring anomalies of any sort, such as black holes, rogue planets and stars   An example would be a protoplanetary disc. Could this allow for material in close proximity so you have rocks in orbit that are close together? What about clouds of material? Would a forming star would have a thick cloud of material around it?  Anything naturally occurring or even unnaturally occurring is fine, so long as space magic or whatever isn't involved.  If I missed anything you can think of, please elaborate. This topic has been difficult for me to find information on.  Extra question: Could a cloud or clouds of opaque gas exist, even for a short time in space? With or without other material present works.  "
2436,Dark Energy Expansion,"The new Cosmos extra features mentions that at about 6,771,500,000 years ago the universe began an accelerated expansion. How do we know this? What evidence do we have for this renewed and accelerated expansion?  From the interactive cosmic calendar on the new Cosmos bluray, dates above taken from the heading     Until [now], gravity has been slowing the expansion of the universe,   but suddenly a mysterious, unknown force that we call dark energy   takes over, the expansion of the universe begins to accelerate   How do we know it was dark energy? Given we can't define or detect dark energy, why do we believe this is the cause? How do we even know this new acceleration happened? Something in the red shift? Is there a gap in the red shift in things we can see that would imply a slow expansion and then a fast expansion? If there is a gap, why is dark energy the only explanation? Or are there other theories?    Yes that is a lot of questions, but the main question is how do we know an accelerated expansion happened at that time? the rest of the questions stem from that, mainly in asking for data to back up claims, for or against "
2437,What is the most mass that matter likely to form?,"If we plot graph between accumulate of forming mass (y-axis) and mass (x-axis), where is the maximum ?  There is a story how I get this question. It start when I think about question ""Is our sun is big or small ?"".  [website]The average mass ends up being around 0.5 solar masses.  But very high mass stars have very short life span so there are more O-type main sequence stars ever form more than O-type main sequence stars we see today.  I think it would be better to measure our sun by using average mass of forming stars than average mass of stars we see.  So, what is average mass of forming stars ?  Then I think a litle bit more. There is no exact boundry between large brown dwarf and small red dwarf stars. So, if we include them too, what is the most mass that matter likely to form ?  If it is inverse-square law, so graph between accumulate mass (y-axis) and mass (x-axis) will be y=c/x where c is constant.  And make the maximum is zero or mean that most of matter aren't form star. At this point, I think I should limit the minimum mass of forming object at some point. But is it inverse-square law for all type of forming object?  If most of matter aren't form star, will be gas cloud. So we don't count them (both molecular gas and mono-atomic gas but dust is still count because it is solid not molecular or mono-atomic object), what is the most mass that matter likely to form?  Please help me or tell me what should read to answer or give keyword to me. "
2438,Affect of leap seconds on the prediction of an eclipse,"There seem to be irregularities in the motion of the earth, so we add ""leap seconds"" to adjust our time accordingly. Since 1972 there have been 26 leap seconds I think. If we extrapolate that backwards 0.5 leap seconds per year, it would be 1 leap minute in 120 years and 5 leap minutes in 600 years.  Would this be enough to throw off a prediction of an eclipse? In other words, could someone in 1416 predict an eclipse right now given the unpredictable errors caused by leap seconds? "
2439,"If an object with mass were to somehow go the speed of light, would it destroy the whole universe?","Would an object with mass traveling the speed of light destroy the whole universe because it would have infinite energy / mass?  According to wikipedia and other sources, it takes infinite energy to go the speed of light, which should be impossible.  However, for the sake of the question, let's assume it were somehow achieved e.g. potentially as described here.   My premise behind it possibly destroying the whole universe is that an object with infinite energy should also have infinite mass ([tex], and infinity / [tex] is still infinity).  Infinite mass should have infinite gravity, which may well destroy the entire universe (although, would this destruction travel at the speed of light, so it would ""slowly"" destroy the universe vs. instantly?).  One thought is that it could just form a black hole instead, but as I understand it, a black hole is an infinitely small (singularity) of infinite density, with a ""net mass"" equal to the net mass that it has ingested.

2440,How to choose between methods to resample/interpolate ephemeris state vectors? Are there recognized techniques for orbital data?,"I have ephemeris data for state vectors of a satellite in a J2000.0 coordinate system. This data is already filtered and cleaned.  The data sample rate ranges between 1 second and 60 seconds, and I want to resample the data down to &lt;10 milliseconds with a constant, regular time step.  I have already managed to interpolate using methods from scipy.interpolate with cubic interpolation; interp1d and griddata.   This leads me to the question of how to choose between various methods to resample/interpolate ephemeris state vectors. Certainly the interpolation of tabular ephemerides is something that astronomers and orbital dynamicists need to do and so there must exist some guidelines or best practices or recognized-better or -worse ways to so this.   Question: How to choose between methods to resample/interpolate ephemeris state vectors? Are there methods recognized as superior for orbital data? "
2441,"Do we make predictions in our time, or local time?","I was scrolling idly through the Wikipedia article on Orion when I read:     Orion will still be recognizable long after most of the other constellations—composed of relatively nearby stars—have distorted into new configurations, with the exception of a few of its stars eventually exploding as supernovae, for example Betelgeuse, which is predicted to explode sometime in the next million years.   Given that Betelgeuse is only 640 light-years away from Earth, the question of whether we're talking about Betelgeuse going supernova in the next million years, or about news of the supernova reaching us in the next million years, is irrelevant, since 640 years is hardly noticeable when you're talking about ten thousand centuries.   But what about a star further away? Say, something in the Andromeda Galaxy, 2.5 million light-years from us? If I read an article stating that a star in the Andromeda Galaxy was going nova in a million years, would that mean:  a) That we think the star will go nova one million years from now, and its light will reach us in 3.5 million years; or b) That we believe the star went nova 1.5 million years ago, and its light will reach us in one million years   In other words, are we making estimates in our time, or in celestial-body-local time? "
2442,Would an analogue of the definition for planets also work for moons?,"This is a follow up question to What exactly is a ""moon""? The conclusions I draw from James K's answer is that the IAU should define what a moon is. They haven't done so yet, but they should.  The obvious way to go about defining ""moon"" would be to build on the definition of a planet:   Planets must be in orbit around the Sun Planets must be round due to their own gravity Planets must have ""cleared the neighbourhood""   This immediately suggests the equivalent definition of a moon:   Moons must be in orbit around the host planet Moons must have [minimum size]. Unfortunately being round doesn't work since not all moons are round (c.f. Mars' moons, unless one reclassifies those as not moons) Moons must have ""cleared the neighbourhood"" of their own orbit, i.e. in their particular orbit around the host they are by far the most massive body   Would such a definition work? If so, why hasn't the IAU also defined moons? It seems so natural after all. If not, what's the catch? "
2443,Active Galaxies,"I've read that there are 4 distinct although related forms of AGs : Seyferts, Quasars, Radio and Blazars. Are there any other forms possible? Also do these forms ever intermix to give something new?  "
2444,How did the solar system get its angular momentum? Why did Earth not fall into the Sun at the start?,"I know that Earth is always falling towards the Sun, but due to its sideways momentum it just misses always.  But how did it all start?  To go into detail, when the gas cloud with zero angular momentum collided, our solar system was made with planets and sun having their own angular momentum which makes them rotate.  But how did the revolution start in the beginning?  Were  they placed in such a position and distance that they started attracting each other but how ? .They were having only rotation .  But a revolution started which forced them to follow a elleptical path  so how this happened in the beginning?  Did some external force act on them and revolution started?  How was  this revolution started?  i have assumed dust cloud was having zero angular momentum but it can have any value that does not affect the question i think ?  "
2445,How many constellations in the Zodiac?,"The astronomical zodiac contains a bunch of constellations along the ecliptic.   Some sources say there are 13 constellations in the astronomical zodiac. Other sources claim there are 12.   According to NASA (source):     If we count all the traditional constellations, there are 13 in the   zodiac, not 12. So here are the dates (give or take one day each year)   when the Sun is between Earth and each of these 13 constellations.)   There seems to be some confusion out there between zodiac constellations (in astronomy) and zodiac signs (in astrology). From the research I've done so far (including the quote above), it seems as though one of them (Ophiuchus) is a ""recent addition"", possibly due to the Earth's precession since ancient times (source).   What (officially?) are the constellations of the astronomical zodiac?  Why do some sources list 12 and others list 13?  "
2446,How can we know the nature of the companion in a neutron star binary?,"The companion of a neutron star could be a main sequence star, white dwarf, neutron star or black hole.  We detected a pulsar-pulsar binary several decades ago. But if one of the pulsar does not radiate towards us, we may be not able to tell it is a pulsar or a black hole. If the companion is not a main sequence star, how do we know the nature of the companion in a neutron star binary?  Of the binary systems with one single neutron star, is that possible there is another neutron star or a hidden black hole? "
2447,Formation of stars,"How are stars formed?  I read somewhere that when dust, gas, rocks etc come close to each other due to gravity, slowly and gradually build up a lot of pressure and form stars.  If what I read is right, then from where did these materials come from? "
2448,How early could life supporting planets been formed?,"In thinking about exclusion options for where its not worth to look for habitable planets, the past came to my mind.  Right at the beginning of the universe, there was no possibility for (carbon based) life supporting planets to form, simply because there was not enough material to do so.  Population III stars burnt out within millions of years to leave some of these elements, but was it enough to form planets? I have some problem getting things into perspective, considering that   there are so many processes that produce different kinds and amounts of isotopes these isotopes are spread out in various different ways (and thus also different concentrations from how they were created) throughout the interstellar medium it takes probably a lot of time to gravitationally condense enough metals into a planet once it was spewed out from e.g. a super nova the majority of stars are smaller so it would probably take a clustering of heavier stars to provide the conditions earlier in the universe.   I would consider a similar distribution of metals like in earth as sufficient for life, and would concentrate only on those found in DNA (N,H,C,P,O), fats (C,H,O) and proteins (C,O,H,N) as well as most of the essential minerals (Ca,Cl,K,Na,Mg,P,S) and maybe at least a bunch of (possibly essential) trace elements (Co,Fe,I,Cu,Mn,Mo,Se,Zn,As,B,Cr,F,Rb,Te,V,Sn,Ni).  So what is the best approximation that we can currently give on when these elements were abundant enough to condense into earth like rocks with earth like elemental distribution? "

2450,"Why not use only one support vane for the secondary mirror, to avoid multiple diffraction spikes?","Each vane holding the secondary mirror in front of the primary causes a diffraction spike. Couldn't the secondary mirror be held with only one vane?  If stability is the issue, couldn't it be substituted be steering the vane to hold the secondary in place with precision, similar to active optics, regardless of winds? And why does the James Webb Space Telescope use three vanes when it will operate in undisturbed microgravity and shadow?  (Maybe the star spikes are desired 'cause they make stars look nice?) "
2451,How much heat is generated from waxing and waning of reflected radiation from the Sun?,"According to this article, the greatest cause of global warming would be from the waxing and waning of reflected radiation from the Sun.

It moved slowly east and had colors similar to what the clouds had recently. In my spotting scope it was circular, sort of looked like the ring nebula, with an apparent diameter bigger than Jupiter. It wasn't a satellite, nor an airplane. Weather balloon? Any ideas? I know this isn't exactly an astronomy question, but I couldn't find another forum interested in such phenomina. "
2454,Meaningful theories of the shape of the universe,"Normally, when people say ""the universe is infinite"" they generally mean something like ""the observable universe is locally flat, it is easy to assume that it is flat way beyond the observable universe, I don't know what lies beyond that, I won't talk about that, that is enough for practical purposes"" (or any other proposition implying infinity in any direction and assumed for simplicity's sake while actually focussing on a small region of the space, the observable universe). So, ""the universe is infinite"" does not seriously mean that physical space goes on forever because this simply makes no sense at all, ""infinite"" is not a number, it is not a magnitude, it is not a property of real things (if you disagree with this premise please explain how the notion of infinity can be seriously applied to any direction of physical space, i.e. how you can seriously think to extend, sic et simpliciter, such a property of your mathematical model to the real world). (Personally I don't think this should be counted as a theory of the shape of the universe at all).  On the contrary, ""the universe is finite and unbounded, compact, closed in all directions"" is indeed a meaningful and in principle acceptable theory because it can be thought, described, discussed for what it actually implies. Of course, we don't know what lies beyond the observable universe but the idea of a compact universe makes sense and it seems to me this is the only meaningful explanation currently available of what ""could"" be (it is not necessarily the right, true explanation, of course).  Is there any other meaningful alternative (which can be thought, described, discussed)? Is there any alternative to the dichotomy ""finite universe"" vs ""infinite universe""? Is there anybody out there working on models that overcome this dichotomy? "
2455,Extracting kinematics from stellar spectra. Why are template stellar spectra necessary?,"I am trying to understand how to extract stellar velocity and velocity dispersion maps from spectral cubes, but with no success so far. To be more precise, I do not understand why people use stellar spectra templates to do so.  For gas kinematics (e.g., Ha emission), the usual approach is to fit a Gaussian function to each spectrum. Then, the means and sigmas correspond to the line-of-sight velocities and velocity dispersions.  For stellar kinematics, most people use pPXF. To my understanding, in the simplest case, pPFX fits a parametric function (e.g., Gaussian) convolved with a template stellar spectrum to the data. Why is that? I tried to read the pPFX papers but there is no explanation for this. It assumes that the use of a template stellar spectrum is obvious and there is no justification for this. Actually the majority of papers that use pPFX assume that the use of a template is a de facto thing and provide no explanation.   What is the rationale behind using a template stellar spectrum? Why can't we just use an inverted Gaussian and fit that to the absorption line of each spectrum?   After some more reading, some papers imply (but do not explicitly say it) that the absorption lines of stellar spectra have complex shapes that can't be modeled with a simple Gaussian. But that is also the case for emission lines! Emission lines can be asymmetric due to multiple kinematic components or beam smearing. Yet, nobody uses templates when extracting kinematic maps from them. I do understand that fitting a single Gaussian to an asymmetric emission line can result in loss of information. But why is this acceptable for emission lines and not acceptable for absorption lines? "
2456,Telescope collimation issue,"Recently I purchase Chinese 8 inch reflector telescope from local store. When I observing starts and planets I've been having trouble getting really sharp image from this telescope. I observe Venus and Jupiter with several eyepieces but I got some ""coma like"" effect all the time with this telescope.   To improve the image quality I decided to collimate this telescope with my laser collimator and cheshire collimators.  Before attaching the collimation device(s) I check primary and secondary mirror alignment through draw tube and it looks like this:    But when I test this setup with laser collimator it show vast miss-alignment in both primary and secondary mirrors. After align both secondary and primary mirrors I've got view similar to this through the draw tube:    I also check above setup with Venus and few starts and I didn't notice any improvements of the image.   I try to collimate this telescope with both cheshire and laser collimator but still I didn't get any clear image with this telescope.   What was the ""most likely"" to have issue in this telescope?  Is problem in draw-tube assembly alignment can cause problem like this or is this happens because of the problem in primary / secondary mirror of this telescope?   Also I test this telescope with several branded and unbranded eyepieces and I didn't notice any improvement.  "

2458,How were the orbital sizes determined in ancient India?,"Rg Veda of ancient India contains a code that gives all planetary orbital information visible in the night sky.

2459,What kind of collision of celestial bodies would be visible to the naked eye?,"When asteroids crash into the Moon they give of huge amounts of energy resulting in a ""bright"" flash, as can be seen in this video. At the end of the video its also says that anyone looking at the Moon at that moment would have been able to observe it without a telescope.    But what kind of collision would be required to be able to be seen from Earth when it would involve more distant bodies? Would one of Jupiter's retrograde moons colliding with one of its prograde moons be visible?  Edit: A real example of a high energy collision would be the collisions of the fragments of comet Shoemaker-Levy-9 with Jupiter. However according to this video from ESA it happened on the opposite side of Jupiter, so not in our view.  "

2461,Question from a non-astronomer /non-mathematician regarding rotation speeds,"I have been watching too much TV related to black holes.  Most black holes are depicted with a disk of matter that spirals into the black hole. Does the mass and diameter of the disk have a bearing on the rotational speed, maximum rotational speed of a black hole? Also, do black holes have gravity? It looks like they must in order to collect matter. Does the gravity of a black hole create gravitational waves much as the electromagnetic waves created around the earth?  Do these waves have any influence on the speed of the black hole's rotation. What about if the rotation if the black hole is not symmetric?  "
2462,Could Pluto and Charon have extra-Solar origin?,"Pluto and Charon seem to have surprisingly young surfaces, considering that resurfacing events were expected to be rare for them.  Could the explanation be that they actually are young? Formed later than the Solar system at some other star and then ejected and captured? Or that they are ancient but have extra-Solar origin and have little cratering because they have spent billions of years as a vagabond planet system in empty interstellar space? Sedna is believed to be captured. "

2464,Is there a flaw with the newer purposes and correlations attributed to the HR diagram? (And would a third axis of mass correct the enclosed flaw?),"When I was younger, I was looking at HR diagrams, and began to experiment with the HR diagram.   I was looking at plotting different groups of stars on the HR diagram when I found RV Tauri stars.  These are stars between 0.4 and 9 solar masses; they have reached the end of their ""life"" and the fusion shell of such a swollen star is advancing towards its surface (when it hits, the planetary nebula starts to form), thus its heats up and swells further. This phase occurs after the Asymptotic Giant Branch/Red Clump phases (AGB for high-metallicity stars, RC for low-metallicity stars).  Taking into account the above information, RV Tauri stars are BOTH more luminous and hotter at the surface than red giants (and AGB/RC stars), they should appear to the upper-left of the latter of the aforementioned groups (given the inversion of the temperature axis). All seemed well.  But then I saw this:    My knowledge of astrophysics tells me that due to stellar winds and the equation E=MC^2, a star's mass (after ""birth"") will usually decrease over time (unless receiving matter from another star). But if RV Tauri stars are above and to the left of red giants, it means that according to the graph, an increase in mass occurs every time a star migrates to the RV Tauri stage.  I know that all graphs have their limitations, but in my mind it was wrong to claim that these correlations were set in stone. Only axes could ever display data in a perfect way (they treat different units of data as separate simple measures, not ""more unstable"" compound measures). So I added a third axis of mass (as this is whole problem is to do with plotting the evolutionary ""tracks"" of stars); this is what is known to affect stellar evolution to the greatest extent. Here is what I came up with:    I did this in order to show that the HR diagram shows general trends of stars (not the evolutionary ones that scientists claim).  My question:  Was this a valid flaw with the HR diagram - and if so, is mass the best axis to add to it?  --EDIT--  The HR diagram is not flawed, I respect that. I also know that there will always be outliers. But the extra correlation of mass seems to be too flawed for that (as detailed above). My new question: is the attribution of these extra correlations wrong? "

2466,How are the masses of celestial bodies determined?,I was scrolling through the list of moons of Jupiter and I wondered how astronomers where able to determine the masses of those objects. When I tried to google it I meanly found results of people deriving the mass of Jupiter from the masses of its moons using Kepler's laws. So the mass of celestial bodies with satellite(s) can be estimated this way. But what about the rest? Or are they all derived from the trajectories of man-made satellites passing near them? 
2467,How does gyrochronology deal with differential rotation and axial tilt?,"K2 seems to become an even better mission than what a continuation of Kepler would have been, at least to some astronomers. By what means is differential star rotation being dealt with? The rotational period of the Sun is 45% longer at its poles than at its equator. Together with the unknown orientation of the star's rotational axis, can this really be sorted out from Doppler broadening of spectral lines? Is a star's rotational period defined as that of its equator or as some average across its surface? "
2468,What is the physics of a gas mass subject to gravity in space?,"There are many formulas for atmospheric pressure on earth, but how does gas behave in free space?  I am thinking about why stars form. I am guessing that the gas density will influence pressure, as well as gravitational force. So both factors must determine if a given gas mass in a given volume in space will collapse into a star.  So a more well defined question would be: what is the relation between mass and volume in space (let's think about hydrogen only) so that this mass will collapse into a star (or at least forms a spherical body)?  A second question is: given a mass and volume so that the gas collapses into a spherical body, what is the pressure vs. distance from the center of the sphere?  Quite interesting I think!  Any ideas?

While I can orientate myself and visualise where we are in the milky way, what is the distinctive black band? I'm assuming it is caused by the absence of stars in these areas. However, as I understood it, the disc (as well as the center) are the areas of highest concentration of stars. Are these 'gaps' caused by dark matter? "
2470,Do origin theories imagine each planet to first orbit the Sun very irregularly before stabilizing?,"What I was wondering is that, for example, toss a few balls into zero gravity space randomly, what would be the steady state motion?   Would not all the balls go on weird directions and undergo irregular orbits due to the interacting and irregular gravitations. I imagine the largest or more dense planets to begin to influence the smaller and eventually it would stabalize.  Is this what origin of the universe theories imagine, or am I totally missing something here? Would the smaller ones eventually all rotate around the largest? All in the same plane, more or less, and all in the same direction? It seems possible but I have no idea if this is mathematically derivable.  What are theories that explain chaotic motions into the present, same plane, same direction planetary orbits around the Sun? "
2471,"how accurate are the predictions for coronal mass ejections-(location, timing and magnitude)?","I suppose this applies to all solar events.

2472,How does a planet lose mass to its host star?,"How do bodies like WASP-12b lose mass to its central body? The process is never really explained in popular media, instead showing visualisations of a thin veil of gas being ""sucked"" in a rather straight line (and then into a ring around the star) rising straight from the surface of the planet. I highly doubt the mechanics which these illustration insinuate: Gravitation isn't working like a vacuum cleaner on a dusty rug. Either the rug goes with it, or the dust stays on the rug. The only mechanism that I can think of are particles from the upper atmosphere which happen to pick up enough thermodynamic energy so that they are faster than the escape velocity of the planet. But is this a process which effects a big enough mass transfer to be of significance? Do I overlook something? How is such a mass defect going on really? "

2476,"Are Saros series separated by ""40"" in numbering related in any way?","Can anyone help with this question? My question arose from an eclipse related observation that I made while looking into lunar Saros series 129. It is the Saros series number for the lunar eclipse that occurred on this past July 27, 2018.   First I saw that this Saros 129 series was ""born"" June 10, 1351 and the series will end June 24, 2613 (70 saros cycles of 18 years = roughly 1260 years). So, I became curious to see if another Saros series had ended just before Saros 129 began. I saw that Saros 89 (less by 40 in series numbering) had ended just four years earlier on July 23, 1347. Investigating further, I learned that there are roughly 40 different Saros series that are ""active"" at any one given time. So then I looked back further to lunar Saros 49 and observed that there does indeed seem to be a pattern involving roughly ""40"" less in the numbering (i.e. yes indeed, series 49 also ended just as series 89 began). These observations do seem to me as more than mere coincidences.  So, my question now is - Are these particular lunar Saros series (separated by ""40"" in numbering) related in any way? - series 49, 89, and 129. Is there another cycle or a ""greater"" cycle also at work here that I am unaware of?   Please see the comments below if what I am asking seems unclear - my comments might rephrase the question for clarity.     Edit - I checked several other Saros series numbers separated by 40. I am adding additional information below - hoping that it might help find an answer to this question about relatedness of the ""40   apart"" series.   Checking other series spaced by 40 numbering, these Saros series (that are numbered 40 apart – i.e. 40, 80, 120 etc.) always contain eclipses that are separated by ~1418 days between eclipses in each respective series (i.e. exactly 4 lunar years/48 lunar months).  Small Saros series (those containing fewer cycles - i.e. 70-74 saros cycles in the series) contain saros cycles that overlap minimally (Saros 129 which is only 70 eclipse cycles in length has no overlap and began just after Saros 89 came to an end 1418 days earlier). Note - zero eclipse cycles between them overlap.  Large Saros series (those containing more cycles – i.e. 80-84 saros cycles in the series) contain saros cycles that overlap accordingly (Saros 120 which is 83 cycles long thus began 13 cycles before Saros 80 came to an end with the overlapping eclipses each gapped by 1418 days). Note - 13 eclipse cycles overlap accordingly - again about 70 eclipse cycles with no overlap between these series.  It seems like about 70 eclipse cycles (constituting ~1262 solar years or ~1300 lunar years) is the standard length of each adjacent Saros series – considering the non-overlapping portion only – each non-overlapping portion separated by 4 lunar years.     Edit - Thanks to anyone who can shed any additional light on this.  "
2477,What causes the raise of temperature in the outer layer of a red giant when the core gets contracted?,"A star emits energy through the fusion of hydrogen to helium in the core through the proton proton cycle or the carbon nitrogen cycle. Over time, hydrogen in the core is increasingly burned, which causes the fusion process to decrease over time. As a result, the star cools down and decreases the radiation pressure in the core. As a result, the core draws a little more together under the influence of its own weight, which increases the temperature. This temperature rise leads to a hydrogen fusion in a shell outside the core.  But how is the temperature increased as the radiation pressure is decreased? Is this increase caused by conduction or convection or....? "
2478,Where is a Hollow Object's Center of Gravity?,"Let's imagine that the Earth's moon is hollow and the remaining mass is structurally strong enough to retain its spherical shape (like a really big tennis ball).

2480,How does gradual crossing over of the Roche limit transform a planet or moon?,"Some cartoon simulations (an example) of an object (assume here a large moon with Earth-like density) which crosses the Roche limit of a much more massive giant planet, illustrate a circle suddenly disintegrating and forming a ring. But such a process occurs gradually over geological time scales. I doubt that there would be a single bad day when the whole moon disintegrates (as in -Oh, there Mt. Everest broke off and flew away!)  Wouldn't the tidal tugging cause volcanism and gradually melt the moon as its (somewhat eccentric) orbit spirals inwards across the limit during millions of years?  How would the melting moon deform? Would it really assume an oval shape, elongated towards the primary planet? Since the near side wants to orbit faster than the far side, wouldn't that cause the moon to spin at an accelerated rate, even if it initially was tidally locked? Would the melting, deforming and spinning save it from disintegrating further to within the Roche limit?  Some examples of Roche limit crossings I know of:   Comet Shoemaker-Levy 9 may have broken up suddenly because it had such a high velocity relative to Jupiter. Phobos will cross its Roche limit to Mars in ~50 million years. It will hardly be a sudden process. I suppose its very low density and mass won't allow any volcanism and melting, though. KOI1843.03, an exoplanet candidate with a density of ~7 g/cm³, is already inside the Roche limits for its less dense compounds which it has shed (as I interpret it).  "
2481,Calculation of day lengths of moons or moons of moons,"Is it possible to calculate the day lengths of moons or moons of moons? If so, does the day length depend on the longitude as well as the latitude? Also, if we calculate the day length, is it possible to take into account the duration the sun is eclipsed by the parent body?  A bit of a background. I am playing a game, Elite Dangerous, and the game provides basic orbital information about planetary bodies like orbital period, rotation period, axial tilt and some more. I was planning to build a tool around this but I have no idea how to calculate such a thing. "
2482,Taking Advantage of Time Dilation,"According to Einstein's theory of Special Relativity, one's speed in relation to a relatively stationary object would 'slow down' time on the moving object.

However, the first thing I noticed was that it was almost at escape velocity!    I guess not much is known, but my overall question is:  Would an exoplanet on an escape trajectory offer us any opportunities for research that have yet to be performed? What would those opportunities be? The answer can be a justified no (E.G. once the planet leaves the host star, we can't observe the doppler shift anymore).

2488,"When the Moon formed and early on, did it orbit over the Earth's equator?","Or was it always at about 5.14 degrees inclination or has the inclination changed over time?  See diagram.  James K's answer to this question got me thinking about this, and I don't mean to call him out, but this part of his answer doesn't seem quite right when he wrote:     Our moon is unique in being close to the plane of the ecliptic, and   not in the plane of the equator, which suggests its formation was not   like that of other moons in the solar system.   For starters, I imagine the physics of the initial orbit of an impact moon would be somewhat complicated, but it seems likely, given an angled impact like the one that's believed to have formed our moon (and hitting at an angle is statistically more common than a direct impact anyway),   So, in this scenario, the planet gets significant angular momentum and this angular momentum should dictate the planet's new equator and axial tilt relative to it's orbit.  I would think the moon should form roughly along that same equatorial plane, but I'm just guessing.   Perhaps it could form several degrees off - not sure.  The 2nd point, is, a rapidly rotating planet with a large equatorial bulge and a close moon, if the Moon formed off the equator, would it's orbit migrate over the equator where the gravitation was greatest and would that happen relatively quickly or not at all?  That's basically the question.   Was the Moon always at roughly 6 degrees off the Earth's equator or has it only moved off an orbit over Earth's equator more recently, perhaps due to the gravitational effect of the Sun?      Or are there other factors.   Mars' axis is thought to have changed rather significantly due to Jupiter's gravitational effects perhaps 100,000 years agao and it's Moons orbit over Mars' equator which suggests that Mars' equatorial bulge dragged the Moons with it? - or is my thinking way off on that?  My thinking is that a planet's equatorial bulge would drive moons towards a 0 degree inclination around it's equatorial bulge and our Moon is different because of proximity to the sun which also has a strong gravitational effect.   The 5.14 degrees of inclination is a balance between the Earth's equator and the solar gravity. "

I need to know how implausible this is. I don't want my story to drift from speculation into impossible worlds. I'm guessing that the occurrence of such a planetary arrangement is very low likely, but is such a system even possible at all?   Now, if it's possible, how messed up the days and seasons would be? I'm bending my brain to figure out what would be the length of day and night in such a system (the planets are very close to each other.)  Any help with this will be really appreciated. "

Also, imagine that there are volcanoes that reach as high as 5 miles below sea level. The planet's effective temperature is similar to Earth (not counting greenhouse).

Longest isn't a very good way of describing things, since it's a relative measure without reference to actual numbers, and implies it's somehow longer in some way that might actually matter in a practical way.  How much longer is this lunar eclipse than:   An ""average"" lunar eclipse?  The next lunar eclipse?  The shortest lunar eclipse this century?  The 2nd longest lunar eclipse this century?   (Feel free to add in any questions/answers I might have missed that may explain ""longest"" in a better context.) "
2498,Does 2 merging black holes necessarily make a quasar?,"2 black holes are about to merge to become a larger black hole. Does this mean it'll become a quasar?  From what I know, quasars are supermassive black holes or a collective amount of them. So, if it merges and becomes a supermassive black hole, does this mean that it is a quasar? If the size is smaller than what would be considered as a supermassive black hole would it not be a quasar? "
2499,How to know the orbital and physical characteristics of the solar planets with only a non-professional telescope?,"I have always been fascinated to see that with so little knowledge, scientists have succeeded in discovering the planets of the solar system, and have succeeded in defining them by their masses as well as by their orbits, temperatures, and so on.  I would like to try to trace this process myself but I do not know how to do.  My starting postulate is simple, I have at my disposal a simple telescope and DSLR camera.  My goal is to define the solar planets, ie to know their masses, their sizes, their orbits, their revolutions.  How to achieve it? Do you have any leads?  EDIT : Thank you for your awesome answers and sorry for my late reply.  I think that I have to separate this problem into 3 different points :   earth's variable : I can find it by reproducing the Greek calculus   Sun's variable : with the two-body problem    planets' variable : with the Gauss' method &amp; observation     I keep you update about my advancements ;) "
2500,Instrument aperture sizes on Hubble Telescope,"When looking at the diagram of the focal plane of the Hubble Space Telescope I noticed that the aperture sizes of most of the scientific instruments are very small. They occupy a very tiny fraction of the focal plane.  I understand that for a spectrograph (like the COS) you need a very small aperture to look at point sources. But why the Advanced Cmaera for Surveys or Wide Field Camera 3 also have so small apertures? Most of the focal plane is not used and it must be very tedious for the guidance system to move the target object exactly into the small aperture of the selected instrument. Even though the WFC3 is called ""wide field"", its field of view is less than 3 arc minutes.  What were the reasons behind selecting these aperture sizes? Is HST designed to observe details of small targets? Are the sizes optimized for majority of observations?  On the other hand the HST is taking images of large objects like nebulae and usually it is necessary to stitch a number of individual frames to create the whole image of a bigger object. For example the Carina nebula (stitched from 48 frames) or the Crab nebula (24 frames).   "
2501,Different full moon face on different places on Earth same time,"I have theoretical question. Let's assume that it is full moon and two different humans are looking at it at the same time. One human is for example in London and one in Beijing. It doesn't really matter where exactly, important is that they are almost on opposite side of Earth but they both see the moon at the same time. I assume they see the moon from different angle. Is it possible that one of them see different part of the moon because of this angle. It could be just the border, tiny part.  Could you please tell me, how big is this tiny part of the moon which one see and the other don't? Few meters? Kilometers?  Thanks everyone for help. "
2502,From Mean Moon to True Moon in an old procedural calendar,"This is a follow-up to How to interpret this old degree notation?  It is about an old calendar system which generates a luni-solar calendar with a procedural method, using a handful of calculations and some constants derived from astronomical observations.  This method originates from ancient India. Today it is used in Thailand to determine public holidays and observance days (uposatha days) for Buddhist monks, which fall on New- and Full Moon days.  Actually it's a neat system that had allowed village ""astronomers / astrologers"" construct a calendar with a method they could memorize by rote learning, without astronomical tools to make precise measurements. It is dreadfully underdocumented, and I've been collating the method and it's practices in Calculating the Uposatha Moondays.  Most useful have been the actual formulas in Rules for Interpolation in the Thai Calendar by J.C. Eade, it is just some basic arithmetic, but following his notation is a puzzle in itself.  Effectively I'm trying to implement these formulas (see image below), in a golang package.  With the earlier help, I arrived at step 13 (Mean Moon). Hooray :)  Step 14. and 15. is a puzzle again.  Step 14.  How would you interpret this? ""(1780 + 80) * 3 on base 808, and add 2""  Step 15.  Eade has (8; 11 : 7) - (6; 27 : 12) = (1; 3 : 55), but that doesn't work.  That specific substr. gives me (1; 13 : 55), which could be a typo in the paper, but that value doesn't carry things forward either.  Things straighten up at step 16., 17., 18., which would produce the paper's results, to get there I faked the values for step 14. and 15, to work at least in the example case given in the paper.  In suriya.go this business is happening in:  func (suDay *SuriyaDay) Init(ce_year int, lunar_year_day int)    "
2503,Existence of multiple universe?,"In this youtube video, Prof. Michio Kaku mentions there could be multiple universes and if there are, then there could be a worm hole to some other universe.  My question is: We are not sure if the Multiverse exists, so how can we believe or have imagined that worm holes could exist and create a path to another universe? "
2504,Are asteroid complexes and types the same?,"Very novice astronomer here. I keep seeing terms like ""S-Complex"" thrown around when talking about asteroids, but no matter how much Googling I do I can't figure out what that exactly means (every article just writes about it assuming the reader knows the definition).  Finally I looked up a free textbook and read the section on asteroids. In Composition and Classification it talks about there being three ""types"" of asteroids (another term I have seen thrown around): C-type, S-type, and M-type. (I've also seen them referred to as Type C, Type S, etc.)  So are the words ""type"" and ""complex"" just synonymous words to classify asteroids? If not, what does ""_ -Complex"" mean when talking about things like S-Complex asteroids?  Thanks! "
2505,Active Galactic Nuclei - categorisation on the basis of observer?,"As we know AGNs are considered to be one of the most luminous objects to be found in the cosmos.Based on the observer, for instance on Earth,  we categorize them on the basis of the angle between the observer and the object. Suppose for instance there are two observers, one on Earth and one on some distant planet (far away from our solar system,  let it be on the opposite side of the Milky Way relative to us). Would both the observers relate an AGN belonging to the same class? In other words, can these categories be relative to their viewing? Like an object can be a QSO to us but to the other observer can the same object be a Seyfert or a Blazar or an RG?  "
2506,Questions about terminology used for Mars and its moons,"I am having difficulty with some terminology:   sub-Martian hemisphere of Deimos ... what place on Deimos does it refer to? leading/trailing apex of Phobos ... what place are those? Apex ... in general it means a top of something, or an end of something pointed; but what does it mean on a relatively spherical body? Anti-Mars meridian ... is this a meridian on the side of the moon facing away from Mars?   Thank you. "

2508,Where does the CO2 in Mars atmosphere come from?,"As far as I know, Earth and Mars were relatively similar when the solar system formed. So most of the CO2 was used to form carbonic rocks (right?). I found that tectonic movements are the reason that the CO2 on Earth could be released again, which don't exist on Mars.   So how comes that the atmosphere has 95% CO2? "

2510,"Metallicity of Celestial Objects: Why ""Metal = Non-metal""?","Metallicity of objects refers to the amount of chemical elements present in it other than Hydrogen and Helium.     Note: The other elements may or may not be actual metals in the true sense of their defintion.   But why did astronomers use such a term as metallicity? What is the history and cause behind coining such a term that may be (or rather actually is being) confused with metal-content of that celestial object ?  Is there any scientific objective or explanation to this? I do not believe it is just a random acceptance, but perhaps there is a not-so-solid motive behind doing this. If there is, what is it? "

2513,How is it that all planets (and moons) in our solar system are in equilibrium orbits?,"Previously, I was told that in order for any bodies to orbit each other for over a long period of time, the orbital period, distance and masses have to be precisely matched such that the bodies won't eventually collide and forming larger bodies or being swung out of orbit.  How is it then, that all 8 planets (and countless dwarf planets), and their moons, and the Sun are all in such equilibrium for over thousands of years (if not millions)? Could it be possible what we see today are what's left, i.e. countless planets or moons have been swung out of the Solar System and collided, until a stable (relatively speaking) system is reached as we observe today? "
2514,In what units to quote the thermal Blackbody temperature,"Just a quick question relating to the thermal Blackbody temperature of a celestial object. In the c.g.s regime of astrophysics, is it more 'sophisticated' to quote the thermal Blackbody temperature in units of Kelvin ([tex]) or in units of [tex]? That is to say to use [tex] and convert to an energy? "
2515,What might be the cause of the hot summer on Earth in 2018?,"I have a question relating to the hot temperature this summer. There are 3 reasons that I can come up with:   Chemical, greenhouse effect. Increased solar activity. Orbital Resonance. The Earth is closer to the Sun, due to gravitational pull from other planets.   Anybody know something about Orbital Resonance? The orbits are affected by one another as they line up? Particularly the larger ones like Jupiter, Neptune and Saturn? "
2516,How did space start?,"How did this 'black fabric' that we call space start? How was it made? How was the initial singularity formed? How did the first atom come into existence?

2517,"If we found evidence of life on Mars, how would we know that it originated on Mars rather than Earth?","Consider this scenario.  One of the probes sent to Mars either very soon, or within the next century, finds conclusive micro-fossil evidence that life once existed on Mars.  One theory today that is quite common is that life might that have arisen on Mars was then ejected into space, floated to Earth and then seeded life on our planet.  I'm tracking with you and that could make sense, assuming we found the conclusive evidence for life on Mars.  However, why would we assume that the early martian life originated on Mars, rather than Earth?  Is it not likely that somewhere between 2.5-3 billion years ago, a major volcanic eruption or meteor impact could have hit an earth teeming with simple-life and sent it hurdling through space to Mars?  I understand that my theory has the gravity of the sun working against it, but I also see it not being entirely impossible.  I mean, 100 years ago, one could assume that life originating on Mars and then being sent this was was ridiculous and impossible but now it's a rational, viable theory.  Considering such a scenario, how would scientist verify that these life-forms didn't originate from Earth, rather than Mars?  It seems to me that this question is the first question that would need to be asked and answered after the fossil-records were found and verified. "
2518,Can a solar flare destroy every electronic item on earth?,"I was reading a book about the sun which suggested that a solar flare can destroy every electronic item on Earth. Is this really true and if so, how would it happen? Could we do anything to to prevent it?  "
2519,Do the heliospheres of stars at the center of globular clusters interact?,"I read that the stars in the center of globular clusters are incredibly close to one another and that these stars can be spaced 100 to 1000 times closer than the stars near the sun. Because these stars are so closely spaced, would their heliospheres interact with each other? There are binary stars whose coronas interact and create powerful x-rays. Would something like that happen with those central globular cluster stars, but on a much larger scale, what with the larger amount of stars involved? "
2520,relation between azimuth angle of the sun and angle of the shodow,What is the relation between azimuth angle of the sun the bearing of an vertical object's shadow?

2521,Would the heliosphere disappears if our sun becomes a white dwarf?,"Just curious I like to know if one fine day our Sun turns into a white dwarf at the later stage of its life, would the magnetic bubble, heliosphere gets thinner and eventually disappear? also at this moment is it changing in size? "
2522,Cause of ~10 minute Oscillations in Low Energy Electron Flux in Earth's Magnetosphere,I am analyzing data from an instrument that measures low energy electron flux at Geo-Stationary orbit.  There are sharp oscillations in the particle flux of 30 eV electrons occurring from about noon to 8 pm (space-craft local).  The period of this activity is relatively consistent at about one cycle every 13 minutes.  I am trying to determine if this is a natural phenomenon or systemic contamination.    EDIT:  I have added a plot of data containing the oscillations.  The Y-axis represents counts per interval and X axis is time.  The purple line represents the south-most zone and the red the north-most.  I have intentionally removed the title/legend/labels.  The oscillations are obvious in the right side of the plot.      My question is this:  Are there any natural cycles within the solar-wind or radiation belts that have a similar frequency?  A second question:  Are there evenly spaced and distinct longitudes containing higher densities of electron cycling that the space-craft might be passing through?  Any other ideas as to the cause of the oscillation are welcome. 
2523,Conversion of matter into antimatter,Is it possible that the intense gravity of a black hole converts matter into antimatter? Does this mean that matter or energy that goes inside the black hole is converted to antimatter? 
2524,Would time go by infinitely fast when crossing the event horizon of a black hole?,"If you were to fall into a black hole, my understanding is that from your reference point, time would speed up (looking out to the rest of the universe), approaching infinity when approaching the event horizon.  If this is correct, would you see the whole universe's future ""life"" flash before your eyes as you fall in, assuming you could somehow withstand the tremendous forces, and assuming black holes don't evaporate?  If it is correct that black holes evaporate due to Hawking radiation, would you be ""transported"" forward in time to where the black hole fully evaporates?    This is considering the ""alternate"" frame of reference from my question: Does matter accumulate just outside the event horizon of a black hole?  In that question, I thought about what happens to matter falling into a black hole from the perspective of someone observing from the outside (e.g. as seen from earth).  Here I am considering the perspective of the thing falling into a black hole.  This also takes into account ideas discussed in: Why does time get slow near a black hole?  Note: This answer to another question provides some insight here too (refer to the last part of the answer): [website]"
2525,"What is meant by ""short lived"" in the duration of a planetary nebula?","In this wikipedia article, it describes planetary nebula as ""short-lived,"" but I'm not sure in relation to what?

Bonus if there are any useful rules of thumb in astronomy terms for future uses (how stars timelines are described, versus galaxies, etc.) "
2526,Which galaxy is closest to the center of the KBC void?,"I was reading up on Bootes void and came across this list of the largest voids in the visible universe, and apparently the one we're in, the KBC void, is not only the biggest, but damned-near spherical.  The Wikipedia page says that the Milky Way is within a few hundred million light-years of the center of the KBC void, but I'm unable to find out what, if anything, is closest to the center.  Is this information available anywhere?  Does anyone know what's at the center of the KBC void? "
2527,Can Space-Time Itself Have Energy Qualities Like Momentum?,"Hypothetically, if space could be moved or scaled, what would happen to everything inside?  I'd like to know if an element of momentum could be transferred to objects by contorting space-time.  Other than gravity, what effects does space-time contortion have on mass? "
2528,Will universe's lakes get boiled by the CMBR?,"From what I can understand, Cosmic Microwave Background Radiation (CMBR) is microwave now, but was initially visible light emitted long time ago.   The microwave is producing a wave that’s about 12 centimeters long.  Now CMBR has right now this (time changing) distribution (peak at 2mm):   By Quantum Doughnut - Own work  This diagram was created with gnuplot., Public Domain, Link  So it looks to me that in some time, when its wavelength falls at around 12cm), some of its energy should be transferred to water molecules the way it is in a microwave oven.    Is it the case? Will some of the CMBR energy actually transferred to water molecules?  Will this energy be too faint to matter at our scale?  "
2529,Is Sun a part of a binary system?,"Does our Sun have a counterpart, i.e., is it a part of a binary-system? If so, how does the other star look like and where is it?  "
2530,Size of Sun as seen on Pluto,"What would be the size of Sun as seen from surface of Pluto? It obviously depends on the distance and one would expect it to be very small. However, due to different optical phenomenon, the size of Sun seen on surface of Pluto could be larger. Can it can be estimated from the annular eclipse Sun-Pluto eclipse picture or other pictures taken by New Horizons probe ? Thanks for your insight.  The picture is also posted on this forum question.  Edit: From the answer given by @Conrad Turner below, Sun should be just pin point at that distance. However, when seen by New Horizons probe from behind Pluto, its size is seen to be almost as large as Pluto. The atmosphere of Pluto must be bending the light so much to make this happen.   Update: This picture was taken from a distance of 2 million km from Pluto. At this distance Sun will have an angular size of 0'49"" (distance 5804550000 km, diameter 1392000 km), while Pluto has the angular size of 4'5"" (distance 2000000 km, diameter 2372 km). However, the picture is showing Sun to have an angular size slightly larger than Pluto (or nearly the same size). Hence, high refraction or scattering or some other phenomenon are at work here.   Considering sizes and distances, if atmosphere of Pluto does nothing to light, the ring of Sun should have been visible around Pluto once probe was 10 million km beyond Pluto. However, the ring of Sun is seen in this picture when probe is  only 2 million km beyond Pluto. The scientists must have known the optical characteristics of Pluto's atmosphere and hence they got the probe early in proper position to take this picture.  "
2531,Could binary gas giants have ring and moon systems?,"Would any moons/rings around either of the gas giants stay intact or get ripped apart by the tidal forces between the two giants? If any moons/rings are able to form around either of the giants, is there a limit to how large a ring system could be, or how far a moon could orbit? "
2532,Why do we presume that the universe has always expanded?,"When I read about the universe having always expanded from a 'singularity', I can't help but wonder if that is perhaps not the case. If a singularity is a point at which everything is infinite and is, theoretically, impossible, why are we quite so convinced it existed? What evidence is there that the universe didn't start out as a single square centimetre or even perhaps half the size it is now, because weve only known it's been expanding for the last century or so because of technological advances? Perhaps it was sizeable to begin with but the pressure of more atoms forming has pushed it outwards? Probably a ridiculous theory but Im intrigued to hear what others think about the whole subject because I just don't think the current presumption is based on any real evidence and is likely to be totally wrong. "
2533,How would one figure out the rate of axial precession of a planet?,"I want to start with the fact that I am by no means an astronomer, or even a hobbyist in the field. I am attempting to build a fantasy world which still reflects accepted physical laws.  My problem comes from the fact that I have no idea how to go about figuring out the period of axial precession for a fantasy earth-like planet. For the Earth, I believe the period is roughly ~26,000 years. I've spent a few days trying to find resources, but in  all honesty I can't wrap my head around half of the equations I've seen presented.  How would I go about doing this calculation for a given planet, and which of its properties would I have to specify in order to do this calculation?  Edit Important? Details: My Earthlike planet has a mass 1.2597x the mass of our earth, and two fairly large moons (actually, one of them may be large enough to classify it as a binary planet but I'm not sure). "
2534,Could a moon orbit two planets at once?,"Let's say you had a binary planet system of two earth-sized worlds with about the same mass.

2537,"How will ""modern equipment"" allow the Royal Observatory to now avoid some of the effects of light pollution at Greenwich?","The article First Light: a new era for the Royal Observatory says (in part):     25 June 2018      The first modern, research-grade telescopes have just been installed at the Royal Observatory Greenwich, making the institution a working observatory once again after 60 years. Marek Kukula, Brendan Owens and Tom Kerss explain what this will mean for them, researchers, and the public.      ""Modern equipment has allowed us to bypass a lot of the disadvantages that drove astronomy away from Greenwich in the middle of the twentieth century.""   How exactly will ""modern equipment"" do this? A blocking filter for the bright yellow sodium line of some streetlights might have some effect, but with high pressure mercury lights and now broadband LED illumination, what other tricks do Greenwich astronomers have up their sleeves?         AMAT’s dual role is aptly matched to its name-sake. Annie Maunder explored the night sky and its phenomena as an astronomer, astrophotographer and science communicator in Greenwich during the 1890s and early 20th Century. She was hired as a human computer at the Royal Observatory in 1891, and though, as a government employee, she was required to give up her position when she married fellow Greenwich astronomer Edward Walter Maunder, she continued to participate in science, publishing books to inform and inspire others and returning to work at the Observatory during the First World War. She was also one of the first women to be elected as a Fellow of the Royal Astronomical Society in 1916. By the end of her life she had gained an international reputation, particularly for her work examining the Sun during eclipses for which she designed her own specialised cameras.   "
2538,How would a planetary defence against comets work?,"Mappings of practically all potentially dangerous asteroids is well underway. But comets seem almost hopeless to protect against.   How far away are approaching comets detected today? How long time before they would pass Earth orbit? Is it feasible in our time to map comets in their beyond Neptune orbits, or will we only detect them while approaching? How much more difficult is it to reach a comet compared to an asteroid? I imagine that the high speed and potentially high inclination of a comet is a challenge for rocketry. Rosetta reaches a comet soon after 10 year trip, but I suppose they picked the easiest to reach comet known.  "
2539,What is the cost and benefit of building two identical telescopes?,"I suppose that (especially space) telescope costs is dominated by design and development, not by material and manufacturing. So once a telescope has been developed and designed, how much extra would it cost to build a second copy of it? It seems as if spy satellites are built in batches of similar designs.  Would the science value of a second similar telescope be modest, compared to a unique instrument, or improvements on the single telescope, for the same cost?  I suppose that using two telescopes as an interferometer would be quite a different instrument design to begin with than just two of the same. "
2540,Did we ever actually see the earth revolving around the sun? Is the geocentric model completely disproved?,"Did we ever actually see the Earth revolving around the Sun?

Thanks for your responses. "
2544,Does the Zwicky Transient Facility only run when triggered by a cell phone?,"A really enjoyable interview with Mansi Kasliwal &amp; Samaya Nissanke (""From discovery to making precision measurements"") is available as a short audio podcast in the BBC News article Gravitational waves hunt now in overdrive describes the very recent gravitational wave events and the way optical searches for the source were initiated by pressing a ""go button"" on a cell phone!  It's a excerpt from the BBC's Science in Action episode What is behind the Indian Ocean Cyclones?  The article is quite a good read as well, and talks about the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF), based on the 48-inch Samuel Oschin Schmidt telescope with several upgrades including a state of the art silicon CCD array replacing the 14 inch square photographic plates it originally used, faster slewing and AI-based recognition of candidate objects.  The huge aperture allows for almost 50 square degree field to be checked down to +20 magnitude every five minutes. That's about one steradian in 5 hours. According to the podcast, it can run as fast as 4000 square degrees per hour, about 1.2 sr/h presumably with a brighter limiting magnitude.  Question: Does the ZTF only start surveying when triggered by a cellphone or other alert, or does it continue to search for new objects and events on some nominal routine whenever there is good visibility?

2545,Why nuclear fusion is a controlled process in stars?,"Nuclear fusion is the main way for stars to generate energy. But we know that nuclear fission and fusion are not controlled, then it causes chain reaction and sudden explosion. But why in the case of stars it does not happen? I mean, that nuclear fusion happen in stars but it take few billion years to complete the amount of hydrogen. Is there any controlling mechanism? If no, what happens here? "
2546,Is it relevant to ask the limits of space?,"Yesterday I watched ""The Orville"" episode 4 and there was interesting moment where a kid and old man saw the space for the first time.     Kid: What is this?      Capitan: Kid, that is space.      Old man: I used to imagine how it would be. It was nothing like this.   How far does it extend?      Kelly: No one knows. Probably to infinity.   In real life we also occasionally ask ourselves if space is finite. And I think it's not a relevant question. We tend to adjust everything to Earth standars where everything is limited and finite. It's very hard for us to accept that something can be infinite, that we even think universe is inside of something and has a material ""shell"" or a wall. But even if there was wall it should be infinite. So in reality our ""wall"" is probably empty space or hard vacuum or infinite universes that we will never see because they are infinitely far away, well maybe most of them.   So it's that simple to accept that space is infinite, that we should not even ask that question, since it's so irrelevant and space can only be infinite.  Sorry for my english and the question, since you probably know this and much more, I just wanted to write something. "

Obviously there are some artistic licenses but I would like nothing in my story to be completely impossible, only (at most) very unlikely.   The climate change that I would like to include in my story is very extreme, so I had to discard any terrestrial forcing to cause it (no change of ocean currents, supervolcanoes and methane eruptions) because they could not act fast enough and would not be so catastrophic (compared to what I imagine). So I focused on astronomical forcing. I excluded the impossibly forcing (for example, a magical and radical reduction in solar luminosity) and those that would be more catastrophic than the climate change itself (i.e. a planetary impact).  The last possible (though very very unlikely) option I have left is a dramatic change in the Earth's orbit. I have some knowledge in physics and astronomy so I did a personal search to figure out what could cause such an orbital change.The most plausible option would be to pass a rogue planet (or star) into the solar system, but since I want to complicate my life, I would like the orbital change to happen without any notice, which is quite impossible if it is the passage of a planet or a star in the solar system to cause it.   The only plausible explanations I have found to fully satisfy my scenario are either the passage of a primordial black hole in the solar system (a black hole with Jupiter's mass would have a schwarzschild radius of 2.8 meters and, if it did not come in direct contact with some celestial body, it may take in the solar system without notice) or passing a high-density cluster of dark matter (assuming an self-interacting form of dark matter) near or inside the solar system. Both are immensely unlikely options and very speculative (primordial black holes are hypothetical objects and we still have no idea what the dark matter really is and how it behaves) but I do not think they are impossible in the beginning, or is it wrong?  Assuming I want to move the Earth 2x10^7 km (if I do not mistake at this distance the average temperature of the planet would be between 15 and 18 ° C lower than now) farther from the sun, could this change take place in less than a decade and the earth's orbit would remain stable or simply the planet would be expelled from the solar system?  I also wondered what effects this sudden and drastic lowering of the Earth's temperature would have on the weather (especially considering that the poles would cool down much faster than the equator) but I think it's a pretty OT question so I leave it as optional "
2550,Is antimatter present on Earth?,"As we all know, antimatter is present across all of space. Is it also present on Earth? If it is present on Earth then by the interaction of matter and antimatter, why don't we feel the energy around us? "
2551,Why is the equinoxes only 2 days and not more?,"The earth is tilted at 23.5 degrees which means that in the solstices the north/south hemisphere is more radiated by the sun and the tilt to the sun is maximum.      In the equinoxes, the tilt is not towards the sun but to the ""side"" so the equator has direct exposure to the sun. As a result, we have 12 hours on day and night on the equinoxes.     What I don't understand is why is it only for these 2 days (equinoxes) that this happens. In the next day(s) I think the equator should have the same exposure to the sun as the equinoxes. Has the tilt changed so much? I couldn't find any animation that shows the exact path of the tilt throughout the year. Can someone please help me understand this? "
2552,How to find if a set of objects lies within a given resolution (5 arcsec) on a telescope?,I am new to astronomy and I was given the task of finding out if there are objects which can't be resolved by a telescope of resolution 5 arcseconds.  I was given the values of RA and Dec of these objects in degrees.

2555,"Theoretically, what is the biggest optical telescope that may exist?","Recently, I read yet another news about E-ELT. It will have 39.3-metre-diameter segmented primary mirror. And I was interested in the next question: Theoretically, what size of the primary mirror (single/multiple/segmented) can have a telescope on Earth for observing at optical wavelengths? And why? I mean what are physical limitations exists?  And the same question about space (not on Earth)?  Update:  On the advice of @TildalWave, to make this question answerable let's make a few adjustments:   Primary mirror should be segmented (or it variations) like on E-ELT. Suppose we have a large (several square kilometers), flat surface high above sea level. We have to build telescope for observing at optical wavelengths.   I know that, there is concept of OWL with 100 metre-diameter segmented primary mirror.  But what about 500 metre-diameter or 1000? Is it possible in theory? "
2556,pp-Chain reactions involving $^{3}_{2}He$ - differences in S-factor,"So I was looking at the pp-chain reactions that take place inside stars in a bit more detail. I got confused about the massive differences in reaction efficiencies concerning two reactions [tex]. In the lecture notes I've googled (the ones that I've understood best so far), the reaction [tex] has an efficiency factor [tex] and being quoted as 'strong reaction'.  While the other reaction I'm confused about in contrast is  [tex] with a way lower reaction probability of [tex] and being quoted as 'electromagnetic interaction'.  So my question: How can we understand the huge discrepancy between [tex] and [tex]? Particularly, when is a reaction a 'strong' interaction? Isn't the strong force necessarily always involved, else there wouldn't be a potential minimum in the nucleus to tunnel to...  Note: The S-Factor is just a part of the velocity dependent reaction cross-section [tex] so that [tex]. Here [tex] is the tunneling probability from Quantum theory.  I would also appreciate any good textbook reference, as so far I'm working with google and random lecture notes I'm finding.  Edit: Thoughts on this: In both cases particles must tunnel towards each other first. Also we know that [tex] is a bound state for the nuclear force. So what might be happening is that in [tex] the nuclei rearrange themselves into the energetically favoured bound state, kicking out the surplus protons. In the case of [tex] the bound state already exists, and thus in most cases the reaction will be reversed. Only a few of those reactions (why?) allow the spontaneous formation of a higher-shell object like [tex], thus the much lower reaction rate. If this story so far makes sense, then I still don't understand when and why  [tex] is formed, I'd be grateful for explanation. "
2557,What detail can Hubble see on Mars?,"I'm researching a scene for a sci-fi novel in which the near-future protagonists observe earth through a station-mounted telescope in Mars orbit. My goal is to understand how much detail they reasonably could discern.  The Hubble telescope is probably a reasonable comparison for my purposes. I found images Hubble took of Mars during a close approach, but I don't know if those represent the best resolution possible or simply the resolution that was selected or available at the time, or indeed, if the whole planet was imaged at a higher resolution than the photo published in popular media outlets.  Can a Hubble-like telescope observe significantly greater detail than displayed in the article below? If so, what might reasonably be resolved? Large cities? Individual buildings?  From Vox.com's Hubble can see galaxies impossibly far away. Here’s what happens when it looks at Mars and Saturn.    above: Cropped from Source NASA, ESA, and STScI    above: Cropped from Source NASA/Hubble "
2558,Is an expanding universe equivalent to a universe in which everything is shrinking?,"Why do we always think of the universe as expanding?   Surely, from our perspective an expanding universe would look exactly the same as a universe in which everything is shrinking away from everything else? ""Oh, but the red shift!"" I hear people exclaim. Well how about this:     The speed of light is simply slowing down.   Hear me out. If the speed of light is a measuring stick against which all things are measured, and if the speed of light is slowing down, then it means everything shrinks and high frequency waves generated in the past are observed with a lower frequency today, which causes us to make observations that the universe is expanding.  What is wrong with my alternative?  Given this, if the speed of light were experiencing, say, exponential decay, wouldn't we expect to see the universe's 'expansion' accelerating? (which I thought was a relatively new and profound discovery)  Apologies if the question is silly, I've never made a formal study of physics and the universe, but this has always baffled me and I haven't been able to find an explanation "
2559,Where did the Sun get hydrogen to work with if it is in the 3rd generation of stars?,"As I see here, the Sun belongs to the Population I group of stars, which is the 3rd generation of the stars in our universe. 1st generation stars are Population III, 2nd generation are Population II, and 3rd generation are Population I.  When the 1st generation (Population III) of stars died, that means most of the hydrogen was burned to helium. Stars die when there is no hydrogen left. Later, the 2nd generation of stars (Population II) appeared and they fuse another portion of hydrogen into heavier elements.  If 1st and 2nd star generations burned hydrogen to helium and more heavier elements, then shouldn't like 90% of all universe hydrogen already be converted to helium and something else? If yes, then there should not be enough hydrogen to make the Sun.  UPDATE 1  Thanks for all your answers. They are very useful. Now a new subquestion appeared. When the star dies, like our Sun, it sends out external layers and core becomes white/other dwarf. In this case, new star can be formed only from the hydrogen from the external layer. The questions what is the percentage of initial star hydrogen after burning it to helium goes from this external layer to outer space? "
2560,Why is time considered a (fourth) dimension?,"Since dimensions usually refer to space and we naturally acknowledge three of them, we also perceive time and we separate space from time (""space AND time""), why is it, that time has ended up in the same shelf as spatial dimensions. Is time really a dimension ""by nature""? Or is it a concesus, shifting our natural understanding what dimensions are, for practical reasons, similarly to defining particles?  EDIT: by Is time really a dimension ""by nature""? I asked if there are good intrinsic reasons, given by to label time as a dimension, as opposed to us labeling it as such, to make it more tangible, explainable.  "

2563,How to deal with the celestial meridian?,"The book “Foundations of Astrophysics” by Ryden and Peterson states that one measures azimuth in the horizontal coordinate system eastwards starting on the northernmost point of the horizon circle. Thus, east becomes 90 degrees, et cetera. Wikipedia and other sites back this up.  However, it seems as if the position of the vernal equinox is always given relative to the southern part of an observer’s celestial meridian. During the vernal equinox, the sun culminates in the south, setting the siderial time to 0h0min. Knowing the difference between the local siderial time and a star’s right ascension gives you the current position of a star, relative to the southern half of the celestial meridian.  This website describes this too: [website]Did I miss something? We so explicitly defined azimuth as being relative to the most northern point on the meridian. Now we’re doing all our measurments relative to the south. I’m not complaining: stars culminate in the south, so this makes it easier. But where did we switch? And when must I switch? Did I make a mistake somewhere? "

2565,Is the time lapse considered when estimating the age of the universe?,"We say that our universe is 13.7 billion years ago.

2566,How large was Mercury before it shrunk?,"There's a theory that the reason Mercury has such an enormous iron core is that it was once a much larger planet before it got impacted by an object, resulting in most of its mass getting blasted away.

2568,"Reshaping black holes to ""push"" the event horizon","I watched this simulation made by LIGO (Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory) where 2 black holes merge into one.  [website]I was therefore thinking that theoretically nothing can escape a black hole given the features of the space and the black hole remain the same due to the strong gravity.  However, I was thinking if 2 black holes stay together close enough, the ""event horizon"" would reshape as well.  We all know the gravity force is F=G(Mm/r^2).  Given a point next to the event horizon but ""inside"" the black hole the gravity there will be so strong that the Escape velocity will be higher than C (speed of light).  If we place another massive object (like another blackhole in the proximities of this point, but far enough, the gravity there will be counteracted and therefore this point will be able to escape its black hole, reshaping the event horizon and making it smaller. (We will have created a ""concavity"" in the event horizon)  My question is:  Given a hypothetical scenario where we create thousands of micro blacholes orbiting the main blackhole, in a gravitational equlibrium. Would we be able to reshape and ""push"" the event horizon strong enough that objects inside could now use the chance and escape?  Could we even pull the matter of the black hole and make it less dense along the time even transforming it into a start destroying the singularity? "
2569,Could Hubble's Law simply be light's frequency decaying over time?,"Is it proven that the frequency of EMR does not decay (at all, ever), and if not, could the observations that led to Hubble's Law simply be that the frequency of light decays over very large durations/distances?  If it does not decay innately simply due to duration, what about the various interactions it would have with particles / fields / ""empty space"" over very large distances; could these have a (reducing) effect on the frequency?

And I thought it would be nice if such a gaseous ocean could have islands as well. 
2572,Why is NEOWISE used for galactic observation?,"I've been studying images from the WISE and NEOWISE missions. WISE used infrared cameras to survey the entire sky. When its primary mission ended in 2010, it was repurposed to look for Near-Earth Objects (described here). What changes to the spacecraft and software were needed in order to change its mission profile? Does it use the same cameras and instruments now as it did when performing a whole-sky survey? My thinking is that a whole-sky survey requires different equipment than a survey to look for small, fast-moving (compared to the stars) asteroids. "
2573,What would happen if a rogue planet hit one of the planets in our Solar System?,"As there are millions of rogue planets in the Milky Way, what would happen if one hit a planet in the Solar System.   For example, if the rogue planet hit Pluto, would Pluto fall in to the Sun due to to its gravity? What kind of catastrophic damage could it do in the Solar System? "
2574,Binaries consisting of a black hole and a non-black hole?,"Are there any known binary systems in which one member is a black hole and the other is not a black hole (main sequence star, giant, neutron star, white dwarf, whatever)?  Googling seems to turn up only discussion of binaries in which both components are black holes. Is there some astrophysical reason why the kind of system I'm talking about cannot form? I think I remember that gravitational wave observatories have talked about black hole-neutron star mergers, but are such systems purely hypothetical so far?  I guess Sagittarius A* is sort of close to being an example, if you count it and the stars orbiting it (or orbiting their common barycenter) as a multiple star system. "
2575,Why is Enceladus the only geologically active moon among its neighbours?,"My understanding of why Enceladus is geologically active is that tidal forces from Saturn and - to a lesser extent - from the nearby larger moon Dione provide heat to the moon's interior, just like Jupiter does for Io.   Should the other mid-to-large-sized moons Mimas, Tethys, Dione and Rhea not also exhibit similar activity from the same forces? Granted, Dione and Rhea are further from Saturn and thus less susceptible to tidal stresses, but what about Tethys and Mimas? What special attributes does Enceladus possess that has allowed it to be geologically active in modern times? Is it purely down to the fact that the interior of Enceladus is more ice than rock compared to the other moons, or are there more factors to consider? "
2576,How are space telescopes stabilised to a perfect standstill?,"I assume that for space telescopes to get good images, they must be put in perfect standstill, as even the slightest deviation in the viewing angle is amplified by the distance of observed objects, results in observing a different area of space. How is this feat accomplished? How can you stabilize an instrument in space, so that it can take images of galaxies gazillion light years away? And how do you know you have succeeded, apart from getting quality imagery? "
2577,What can the total stellar mass of galaxies tell us?,"The total stellar mass of a galaxy cannot be measured directly. Astronomers can infer it from the galaxy spectrum by stellar population synthesis. However, since high-mass stars dominate the spectrum but contribute little to the total stellar mass, the inferred total stellar mass is sensitive to initial mass function (IMF) which is usually assumed a priori. One can also measure the total stellar mass by kinematics, but it is the total mass of stars, dark matter and gas enclosed that is measured in this way, and we still need some assumptions (say, on the dark matter profile) to obtain the total STELLAR mass. In a word, it's very difficult to measure the total stellar mass of a galaxy precisely.   So I wonder why people are still interested in this parameter. What can it tell us about the formation and evolution of galaxies?   It seems that what can be measured relatively more accurately is the properties of high-mass stars which are also the main sources of stellar feedback and metal enrichment. Why not just focus on these stars? What makes low-mass stars (or to be more concrete, their mass) important to the galaxy as a whole?  "
2578,Acceleration in Galaxies Collision,"In the far future the Milky Way and Andromeda will collide. As far I know direct collision between large dense objects (black holes, stars, planets, etc.) is unlikely due to the relative ""low density"" of both galaxies. My naive intuition is it's like two big clouds of dust merging.  I know at the collision time the Sun will be most like a red star and Earth a scorched dead planet. For the sake of the next questions let's hypothesise another system with a star resembling the Sun and another small beautiful third rocky blue planet holding some advanced live form. Also, for acceleration measures, let's use a frame of reference like if someone is observing from far away both galaxies getting close one to another and interacting.  Some questions pop up in my mind.   Can the gravitational interaction sling shot an entire stellar system? How much Km/s2 we can expect these system to accelerate? (In a most extreme plausible case). How this acceleration can affect the system? Can it de-stabilise planet orbits for example? How it can affect life? Can it affect magnetosphere? change it's shape? Can solar flares/wind get stronger in some path due particles acceleration? If another star passes really near (let's say 1 light year at closest approach) but at great speed can its light reach that planet at high energy levels, let's say x-ray and affect that planet life?

2580,Can the period of the planet transit across the sun be calculated in the same way the eclipse year is?,"I read from Wikipedia[tex]Eclipse cycle that the eclipse year, which is the period of Earth's hitting a certain node of its orbit around the sun, that is, the ecliptic, and the moon's orbit around Earth, can be calculated as the beat period of the synodic month and draconic month. The recent occurrence of planet transits across the sun lets me wonder if this principle can be applied to the case of a planet's transit across the sun as seen by an observer on another planet in an outer orbit.  When Venus transited across the sun on June 6, 2012, I read it takes place in pattern of the 8-year-interval pairs with each pair at the interval of 105.5 years and 121.5 years alternately, with one in each pair being when Venus crosses the ecliptic plane at its ascending node and the other being when Venus crosses the ecliptic plane at its descending node. This made me contemplate whether the period of the Venus transit across the sun when it crosses the ecliptic plane at its certain node can be calculated in the way the eclipse year is, that is, whether the following holds:      The period of the Venus transit across the sun as it crosses the   ecliptic plane at its certain node = The beat period of the period of Venus'   being in inferior conjunction with the sun and the period of Venus'   hitting that node.   Early this July I read from EarthSky an observer on Pluto may, through some optical aid, be able to see Earth transiting the sun on July 12, when Pluto was at opposition, which, together with the upcoming event, that on October 24, 2018 Pluto will cross the ecliptic plane at its descending node, is responsible for the Earth transit as seen from Pluto. Last time this kind of transit occurred on January 11, 1931 on account of both that Pluto was at opposition that day and that Pluto crossed the ecliptic plane at its ascending node on September 9, 1930. And next time this kind of transit will occur when Pluto is at opposition 161 years later, around when Pluto will cross the ecliptic plane at the same node it crossed in 1930. This makes me again contemplate whether what follows holds:      The period of the Earth transit across the sun as seen from Pluto as   Pluto crosses the ecliptic plane at its certain node = The beat period of the   period of Pluto's being at opposition and the period of Earth's   hitting that node.   I think the principal difference between the eclipse year and planet transit across the sun is that in the former case both the moon and the sun are in a closed orbit around Earth while in the latter case only the sun is in a closed orbit around the observer-sited planet (the transiting planet is in a tortuous path from the perspective of the observer). I don't know if this feature would affect the applicability of the beat-period principle. If the principle of beat period as it used to calculate the eclipse year can be applied to the above two examples, I think it should be able to be generally applied to calculate the period of any planet's transit across the sun as seen by an observer on an outer planet, right? That is, should what follows generally hold?      The period of a planet's transit across the sun as seen from an outer   planet as it crosses the outer planet's orbit plane at its certain node =   The beat period of the period of the transiting planet's being in   inferior conjunction with the sun from the outer planet's perspective   and the period of the transiting planet’s hitting that node  "
2581,Eclipses with SkyField,"I'm trying to compute solar eclipses for a long period of time, see Back-predicting solar eclipses  Initially, I wanted at several points on Earth whether an eclipse was visible at some point in time. I have since changed the approach and I will now compute whether an eclipse could be seen from the center of the Earth at a given moment. Later, after knowing roughly the time of the eclipse, I will iterate over a grid on Earth to check where it could be actually seen. So far, my first question is: is it right to check for eclipses at the center of the Earth?  Secondly, I wrote a small code in Python to test how good I am at predicting eclipses, checking against [website]for these coordinates:  Lat.: 27.4782° N Long.: 109.9299° W  #!/usr/bin/python  from skyfield.api import load, Topos from skyfield.positionlib import ICRF  planets = load('Ephemerides/de422.bsp') ts = load.timescale()  earth = planets['earth'] sun = planets['sun'] moon = planets['moon']  time = ts.utc(150,12,06,23,49,21.9) place = earth + Topos('27.4782 N','109.9299 W')  observe_moon = place.at(time).observe(moon).apparent().position.au observe_sun = place.at(time).observe(sun).apparent().position.au distance = ICRF(observe_moon).separation_from(ICRF(observe_sun)) distance = distance.degrees  print distance   The distance I obtain is above 10 degrees, while at the time provided, if I did things correctly, the eclipse was at its maximum at those coordinates. What is wrong in my code or my understanding? "
2582,"Are there ways to estimate size of the ""whole universe""?","Words escape me, but by ""whole universe"" (I think) I mean everything that's spatially connected to the observable universe in a conventional sense. If there is a better term for it, please let me know!  I was surprised to find out that theories and measurements about the big bang seem to mostly relate to the size of the observable universe via expansion, and if I understand correctly don't say much about the size of the whole universe.  Have I got this right? Are there any ways at all to try to estimate size of the whole universe? Does the term even mean anything?

2583,"Why are the stars in my image so green (false color image, HSO palette)?","  This is my first try in false color imaging. The target was IC5070 - the pelican nebula. I took around 3 hours of data (around 1h for Ha, SII and OIII). Then after stacking did an LRGB combination in PixInsight using Ha for red, SII for green and OIII for blue. For luminance I used the stacked Ha image.  Now my question is, why are most of these stars so green? It would suggest that they were really bright in the silicon spectrum right? If so wouldn't that mean that those stars are extremly silicon heavy?  (Ignore the vertical blue-green line, its a stacking artifact resulting from a camera defect on those pixels) "
2584,How do rogue planets orbit around stars in other planetary systems?,"I got some interesting answers for What would happen if a rogue planet hit one of the planets in our Solar System?   But I have seen some documentaries that state that rogue planets from other planetary systems (which are ejected from the planetary systems in which they formed) have become part of the other planetary systems and orbit around those new stars as planets.  For example, please check this link:     The latest research suggests that sometimes, these rogue, nomadic worlds can find a new home by being captured into orbit around other stars.   How is this possible? Stars' gravity can pull the rogue planet into them. How do rogue planets escape this and orbit around the new stars. This seems to be a bit mysterious. "

Or it will never reach the ""edge"" of the universe because the universe is expanding faster?  UPDATE 1  Of course, I assume that photon will no be absorbed :) because it is just a theoretical thinking. And return back I mean not exactly to the same point, but approximately within some range (let say 5% of the universe size).  Do I correctly understand that there are a few options for the case when the universe is finite (means ""closed geometry""):    Photon will never return back because the universe will collapse before it (in case if there are no dark energy). Photon will never return back because universe expanding faster than light speed. Photon will come back because universe expanding slower than light. And what  of these 3 options is most probable from a current scientists point of view?  "
2587,Why do our clocks not go out of sync with the day over a year?,"Ok, so our clocks time 24 hours, our planet takes 24 hours to rotate completely and our planet revolves around the sun in 365 days.   Imagine at the start of the year, the side of Earth facing Sol is 'Side A' and the dark side is 'Side B'. The side of the sun that Earth sees is 'Side A' and the opposite side is 'Side B'.  After half a year, wouldn't 'Side B' of Earth be facing 'Side B' of Sol, and thus the day/night cycle would be out of sync by 12 hours?  I've been trying to get my head around this problem for ages and I can't seem to figure it out. It seems like the angle that the sun hits the Earth must change by about a degree per day until it's gone around 360 degrees. Would that not mean the clocks offset by 1/365th of 24 hours every day over a year? "
2588,Find a planet with incomplete information of a star chart,"I am wondering why it was so hard to locate Luke in Star Was Episode 7, if you already have the small part of the map.  Suppose we have a sector of our galaxy that roughly equals the one missing in this image. (I found no image on the web of the part in question. In the movie version on netflix you can take good look at it at 52:56.)   Is it possible and how hard would it be to identify a planet within that part of the map, given our knowledge of our galaxy and   we only know the small part and have no information about its size. there might be ""landmarks"" (planets, stars, nebulars, and the like) missing.   If it is not possible, what minimum requirements would have to be met (on the available equipment, the map, our knowledge, ..) to make it possible?  Please note: this is not a Star Wars question, that is just the motivation.  About which galaxies do we have enough knowledge to be able to do this?  [website]"
2589,Date of solstices pre-0 AD,"I’ve written a script based on Meeus’s Astronomical Algorithms to calculate the position of the sun, moon etc. up to about 4000 BC. Everything looks good, except when I go to 4000 BC the solstice are about a month after expected dates (they fall mid-July and mid-January. I checked through this forum and came across this: [website]Does the precession mean the solstices and equinoxes can shift to this extent? Or have I forgotten a step?  Many thanks. "
2590,What's the color of Upsilon Scorpii?,"I was looking to Scorpio the other day, and noticed that the last star in the tail (the telson's tip) -- known as Upsilon Scorpii, υ Scorpii, or Lesath -- seemed yet more red than the ""heart"" of the scorpion -- Antares or Alpha Scorpii. Was it that I was drunk, or some kind of sky pollution? (Actually, a friend confirmed it was red, and she seemed sober than me.) Or is it, indeed, red? I couldn't find any information on-line. I saw this database, but don't know how to find a star by its name, or if they have information about the color. "
2591,Why the moon is blinding me right now?,"I'm on the most northern part of Germany (Schleswig-Holstein) it is 11.20pm right now and the moon is here as bright as I never saw it before I was just outside and it is as bright as if it was dim daylight. When the clouds moved away from the moon and I looked into the moon for a little moment it was so bright, that it actually glared me for a little moment. Is there anything specific going on that is just favored this event? Or is it something that simply happens sometimes and I just never noticed it before? "
2592,"What exactly is wrong with this plaque in Neil deGrasse Tyson's ""back yard""? Has it been fixed?","The Wikipedia subsection Observable Universe; Misconceptions on its size shows this image of a plaque, with the caption:     An example of the misconception that the radius of the observable universe is 13 billion light-years. This plaque appears at the Rose Center for Earth and Space in New York City.   According to Wikipedia:     The Rose Center for Earth and Space is a part of the American Museum of Natural History in New York City. The Center's complete name is The Frederick Phineas and Sandra Priest Rose Center for Earth and Space. The main entrance is located on the northern side of the museum on 81st Street near Central Park West in Manhattan's Upper West Side. Completed in 2000, it includes the new Hayden Planetarium, the original of which was opened in 1935 and closed in 1997. Neil deGrasse Tyson is its first and, to date, only director.   That last line is the operative part. Dr. Tyson is a world-renowned stickler for truth and accuracy, and so a problem in is own back yard needs to be investigated.   What exactly is wrong with this plaque photographed in 2011?  What should it have said?

2593,"Why can we see the Pillars of Creation, but not Proxima B?","I was wondering how is it that we can see the Pillars of Creation (I know they're no longer there too) which are labeled as 6,500 light years away from earth and yet Proxima B is labeled at just 4.2 light years away and yet we cannot see it clearly and it was very difficult to find?  I understand that the Pillars of Creation are giant gas bubbles with different molecules that make it so visible and Proxima B is a relatively tiny planet that doesn't emit light but I cannot fathom how much greater the distance is from Proxima B and yet it is clearly much more visible. Shouldn't our current technology be able to view 'close up' images of Proxima B?  What am I missing here? "
2594,Astrodynamic Canonical Units,"Maybe this is more appropriate for the Physics or Maths, but anyway.  I am struggling with applying Canonical units with formulas. I am struggling specifically with how they are used, am I to convert all the time? Use the whole numbers?  An example is a a simple velocity of a circular orbit: v= SQRT Mu/r  r  =2DU (12,756.23KM) Mu =1DU3/TU3 (3.9860KM3/s2)  v = 4.5641KM/S or 0.707DU    In order to convert it back to DU I had to use a percentage calculator (I'm bad at fractions). Is there a simpler way of converting back and forth? "
2595,Reference: First spectrographic observations by Fraunhofer,"In several books I find reported that the first scientist to perform spectrographic observations of celestial objects was Fraunhofer with the spectrographs he himself produced. I do not find though a reference, a paper, in which he presents this work.  Using the NASA astrophysics data systems I find only the papers concerning his technical work with glasses but not the observations of Venus, Mars, and other heavenly bodies, he performed.  I find books on Google Books reporting such observations but unfortunately I can view limited parts of these books and not their bibliographies.  Anybody can find a reference for any of these observations? "
2596,Presenting / printing Right Ascension and Declination values,"Are there any standards or established practices on how to write / represent Right Ascension (RA) and Declination (DEC) values in the sexagesimal format? I have seen all of the following. E.g. for RA:   02 03 04 (assumed to mean 2 hours, 3 hourly minutes and 4 hourly seconds) 2 3 4 (same as above) 2h 3m 4s (same as above) 2d 3' 6"" (assumed to mean 2 degrees, 3 degree minutes and 4 degree seconds) 2d 3m 6s (same as above) 15.33 (assumed to mean 15.33 degrees) 9.5H (assumed to mean 9 hours, 30 hourly minutes and zero hourly seconds) 8d 3.5 (assumed to mean 8 degrees, 3 degree minutes and 30 degree seconds)   Likewise for DEC (even though for DEC when the first component does not have a suffix it is assumed by default to be in degrees, not hours). Does any astronomical association publish guidelines for the printing / presentation of such values or on how software should accept user's input of such values? "
2597,How often do stars pass close (~1ly) to the Sun?,"Interstellar exchange of massive objects is difficult across several light years. But as the stars orbit the galaxy the distances between them change. I don't find data for neighbor star distances which covers more than a couple of a hundred thousand years. I can imagine that it is difficult to trace their orbits further given todays uncertainties in distance measurements. But I'm interested in a purely statistical/geometrical estimation of how frequent nearby Sun-star passages have been.   How many times has a star come closer than, for example, 1 light year from the Sun since it formed? How well mixed have the nearest stars become over time? What fraction of them have followed the Sun since formation and made multiple passages?   I suppose that 1 light year's distance is enough to cause disturbances in the Oort cloud and likely exhange comets.   "
2598,Does Time Exist for Photons?,"If time slows down the closer you get to the speed of light, does it follow that time does not exist for photons. Do photons - even if they travel across billions of light years of space - arrive at the same time as they are created? And if this is so, does this not explain the peculiarities of the double-slit experiment? "
2599,What is $v_{GSR}$,"In this paper (""The Apache Point Observatory Galactic Evolution Experiment: First Detection of High Velocity Milky Way Bar Stars"") they plot and calculate [tex]. [tex] stands for Galactic Standard of Rest, but I am not sure which velocity they mean. Is it the Radial Velocity, with respect to the GSR, or something else?   Maybe to  clarify: suppose I have a database of stars with Cartesian location and velocities, how do I calculate the [tex] of a single star? "
2600,Binary stars of different ages?,"In an answer on a different SE someone raised the point that “common” explainations published never discuss stars being captured.  Presumably binaries are formed as pairs, or team up while still in the birth cluster.  It seems quite plausible that an aged star (or stellar reminant) can be paired with a main sequence star in its prime, having paired up well after the old supernova was completed.  Is this mechanism of multi-body reassortment known to occur, presumed, or thought to not occur?  Another mechanism implied but not detailed in popular works is the possible situation with Proxima Centauri: a star going with the flow in the galaxy may find itself loosly attached to another star (or system), and this bond is so tenuous that it can easily be broken by another passing star, so the distant star do-si-dos to different partners over the course of billions of years.  Is this an accurate depiction of the real situation?  This loose attachment out of the general flow can occur with stars of any mass, right?  In any case, a star can be captured with planets, right?  Naturally a close-enough encounter between stars (and reminants) could seriously disrupt a planetary system, but I want to check on the possibility that capture with planets is also a possibility.  I think that’s not a problem for the “loose attachment” case, and Proxima Cen may indeed have a planet.  How about the necessary mechanics of binary reassortment?  Is that necessarily so close and tight thatbplanets would be seriously disrupted, or is it plausible that planets would simply go along for the ride?    Update: PSR B1620-26.  A neutron star captures a star with planet, trading off its original companion. "
2601,What was the nature of the signal received from the direction of HD164595?,"There's been a story in the news recently of a potential SETI candidate signal received from the vicinity of star HD164595.  What's the nature of this signal?  Is it a single pulse of energy, or does it change over time?  Can someone point me to a link or paper than shows it in more detail? "
2602,What explains this puzzling radio signature from a fireball?,"September 21, 2017 a bright fireball over Holland was reported by hundreds of people. Several all-sky cameras recorded it as well as a special radio beacon set up to capture radio signatures of meteors - the BRAMS beacon at Dourbes, Belgium.  I'm puzzled by what I see in the radio spectrogram from one of the BRAMS stations at Ophain, Belgium :  The orange blob in the center is the radio signature of this fireball. The horizontal line is the beacon signal (0 Hz), time runs horizontally, frequency runs vertically, positive above and negative below the beacon line. What is displayed are Doppler shifts.  The track for this fireball has been computed since and relative to the radio receiver at Ophain and radio beacon at Dourbes it is receding from both. However, the Doppler blob is above the beacon line which is only possible when the fireball recedes from Ophain but approaches the beacon, approaches both, or approaches Ophain but recedes from the beacon - NOT when it recedes from both!  The only way I can make sense out of this is to assume that the ionized gas trail from the fireball reflecting the radiowaves was NOT receding from the receiver and transmitter beacon - only the fireball was?!  Or are there any other explanations? "
2603,Is the Sun homogeneous?,Does the Sun have the same composition and density everywhee within it? How does it vary in other stars? 
2604,Is communication with proxima b possible with todays technology?,"Let's say we have already a base on an exoplanet (like Proxima B). Would it be possible to send information from that base to the earth with todays technology? Not to talk about communication with such a distance ...  And how would it be done? Light or Radiowaves? Would it be possible to direct it so well, that some very small fraction of that wave could reach the earth? Or is it only a question of how much energy is needed?  "
2605,The light of which star is next to reach the earth?,I heard that the sky wouldn't be dark at night if the light of every star had already reached the earth.   Of which (currently invisible) star will the light reach the earth next and when will that be? What was the last star that we can now see at night to reach the earth and when was that? How can we know (1) if the light hasn't even reached us yet? Or can't we know and will a star suddenly appear without anyone being able to predict that?  
2606,How can we use hypervelocity stars to determine the origins of the Universe?,"I was reading this article finding evidence of Universe's origin, which describes that in 1 trillion years we may lose the ability to determine how the universe was created.  The answer seems to be using hypervelocity stars.  These are stars that have been ejected from their galaxy.  Using the expansion of the universe, we can use the velocity of the star to then determine evidence of the Big Bang. But how does this work?  Is there calculations we can do now that agree with our understanding of the universe and its age when working with hypervelocity stars?  I understand finding a hypervelocity star is very hard to do. I guess my thought here is that astronomers have modeled this scenario and found that if we were to find a hypervelocity star, we could then use the scenario above to calculate the age.  I'm assuming the age calculated agrees with current estimates. "
2607,Is it possible to have two objects moving by sum speed of light (c) in the opposite direction?,"I am puzzled by this question, because by the laws between the two object the relative gravitation force should be infinite. Anyways we can take two objects where the sum of speeds are equaling c (speed of light).  So the answer should be not, but many theoretical physicists making examples to demonstrate what happens if we closing to the speed of light. But what happens if we reach 90% of the speed of light and an object flies on the opposite direction by 10% of speed of light? By rational thinking there should be an extreme gravitational force between the two items.  All of these are true if I understood correctly the the General Relativity Theory.  Can somebody point out what is the problem with my thinking if there is?  "
2608,What's the theoretical maximum density of a galaxy?,In watching this Hubble video on Omega Centari it got me thinking about how dense a galaxy can get. Do we know how dense a galaxy can get?  Are there any good resources on reading more about very dense galaxies?  
2609,How is the total mass of all the Solar System's small asteroids and meteoroids estimated?,"This diagram from wikipedia (shown below) graphs asteroid Diameter against Number of asteroids, for the Solar System.  (Graphic is courtesy of the Marco Colombo, DensityDesign Research Lab).  Presumably the Diameter data for the larger asteroids is strongly supported by observations.  But for progressively smaller bodies direct observational data is presumably less available.  The pattern shows a strong, but not perfect, linear inverse correlation between log(Diameter ) and log(Number).  This seems quite reasonable for large bodies. It also sounds plausible that such a pattern continues into the realm of small asteroids and meteoroids.    But what is the physical justification for extending the log:log pattern into the realm of small bodies which are too small to see from Earth?  Presumably the current estimate of the total mass of the Astroid Belt (4% of the mass of the Moon) is consistent with this distribution model.  But can we confidently rule out the possibility that the linear log:log pattern breaks down for small objects allowing, for example, a much larger number (and mass) of small bodies to be present in the Asteroid Belt, sufficient say for the total combined mass to equal 100% of our Moon's mass?   "
2610,Is the Sun in our solar system moving or stationary?,"When I was small, I read that Sun is fixed at the center of the solar system and that all the other planets rotate around it.  But later I heard that even the Sun is not fixed; it moves. Is this true?  Why had people previously thought that the Sun is fixed?  Is this correct planets in helix path or spring like path?   "
2611,What's the difference between GSR and Grf,"I note there are two terms about Galactic rest frame in literatures: Galactic Standard of Rest (GSR) and Galactic Rest Frame (Grf).   Are they the same frame? If not, what's the difference? "
2612,Does the Sun have permanent geographical features?,"Equivalent formulations of this question:   Would it make any sense to draw a map of the Sun? Is the Sun heterogeneous with respect to latitude and longitude? (I know that it is heterogeneous with respect to altitude/depth)   I know that the Sun does not rotate uniformly, so any map would line up differently as time passes.  However, this does not rule out a slice of the Sun at a given latitude having permanent geographical features, since this slice does rotate uniformly.  Of course, even geographical features on Earth are not really permanent, they change on long time scales.  I don't expect the Sun to have any eternal features, I'm really just thinking about features that change on long time scales, or at least longer than a few months (e.g. not sunspots). "
2613,What is the coordinate acceleration for pure radial motion?,"As seen in this answer and also in this book chapter 6, page 6-10 expression 22,  when you are falling in radially from being at rest at infinity your velocity in coordinate time, as seen from a distant observer, can be described by the expression:  [tex]  If we assume ”[tex]” to be the real radial distance and not just the ”r-parameter of Schwarzschild coordinates” this is the velocity [tex]. I want to know the expression for the acceleration as a function of ”[tex]” and ”[tex]” for a small object of mass [tex] moving purely radially inwards or outwards from a compact spherically symmetric mass distribution in the general case.  By taking the derivative with respect to ""r"" of the expression above I get: [tex]  From these two expressions we see that the maximum velocity is [tex] at [tex]. From this finding, [tex] should not be so hard but this will not be a general expression but only the acceleration of something dropped from rest at infinity. In Schwarzschild coordinates the radial velocity of light goes as [tex]. At [tex] this becomes [tex] so when falling in from being at rest at infinity you reach maximal velocity when [tex]. Maybe you can say that gravitation becomes repulsive whenever you are travelling towards the center of the gravitational field faster than [tex] times the local speed of light?  Question: What does the general expression for the acceleration of an object in coordinate time look like for an object moving purely radially inwards/outwards from the center of the gravitational field assuming a spherically symmetric non-spinning mass distribution and that the r-parameter of the Schwarzschild coordinates is the real physical distance?  I am looking for an expression for the instantaneous acceleration as a function of ""r"" and ""v"".     I know that in the weak fields of our solar system Nasa/JPL are using this expression to calculate Newtonian plus relativistic acceleration:  [tex]  This is based upon a first order expansion of the Schwarzshild solution in isotropic coordinates. For pure radial infall you get:  [tex] which becomes repulsive whenever you are approaching the central mass faster than:   [tex]  I am hoping for an exact solution for pure radial acceleration in ""Schwarzschild coordinate space"" and coordinate time similar to the approximate solution for pure radial acceleration you can get from the Nasa equation.    As per the answer by amateurAstro down below the expression should be:  [tex]  This is consistent with stuffing:  [tex]  into  [tex]  to get (at least this is true for pure radial and pure non-radial motion):  [tex].  (I am trying to find a velocity-dependent term that together with the classical Newtonian acceleration should reproduce Schwarzshild orbits exactly) "
2614,"How to calculate solar coordinates. (Right Ascension, Declination, and ultimately the Altitude and Azimuth of the Sun)","As the title says I am trying to calculate solar coordinates of the sun for a given location and time.

Alt value is within 6 degrees but I cannot figure out why it is that close because the latitude is in radians instead of degrees like the other values.

2619,What star was the asteroid 2014 MU69 predicted to occult on 2018-08-04?,"From a search, I found a list of some preparatory HST observations made for the August 4, 2018 occultation of a star by the asteroid 2014 MU69     We propose observations in support of the upcoming New Horizons encounter for 2014MU69. One visit is for support observations of a star to be occulted by 2014MU69 on 2018 August 4 from which ultra-precise astrometry and shape information about the target can be derived. The second visit is for a backup epoch of astrometry on 2014MU69 itself at the end of the 2018 observing window at a time when New Horizons will also be observing the target. (minor typographical edits made)   Five lines are shown, for measurements between 2018-04-30 01:03 and 01:48. The target is listed as MU20180804 but that name seems to be the identification of an occultation, not the name of a star.  So far I have not figured out the actual identity of the star that was predicted to be occulted by 2014 MU69 on 2018-08-04.   Here is a very nice prediction for three occultations by 2014 MU69 last year (2017). However when I go to the main page for that asteroid occultation site and look at 2018-08-04 I don't see any events with MU69 as the asteroid!

But, meteors impact other planets.  Are they still meteorites?  Or is there another word for them.  And, if they are still called meteorites, what is the threshold for an object to be impacted upon by a meteor or meteoroid in this case, and still have the meteoroid be called a meteorite.

2621,How can the universe be expanding faster than speed of light?,"So the story goes like this:  A long time ago, 13.799±0.021 billion years to be exact, something happened. It was a big bang, loud explosion and universe came to existence. It grew and grew, and now we know that the observable universe is about 93 billion light years in diameter. So it means that     objects that were once close ... are now up to around 45.7 billion   light years away rather than up to 13.799 billion light years away ...   Hence my question is that everything is traveling faster than the speed of light?  If it is, then what does it mean in terms of special relativity?    I did read:   Is the universe expanding faster than speed of light? How fast is the universe expanding?  "
2622,What point does Earth actually orbit?,"If we consider the two largest masses in our solar system - the Sun and Jupiter, by themselves, they will orbit a common barycenter which is somewhere offset from the Sun's center in the direction of Jupiter (just above the Sun's surface). If we add Saturn, things get more complicated, but there is still a barycenter, even if it follows a complex path with respect to the Sun's center (or the Sun has a complex wobble around the barycenter). Add Neptune and all the other masses in the solar system, and things get even more complicated. Neverthess, there is still a barycenter (often outside the limb of the Sun) about which the Sun does a complex dance.  Now, what is Earth actually orbiting? The Earth's orbit is described to be an ellipse; the ""center"" of an elliptical orbit occurs at one of the focal points of the ellipse. What is at the focal point of the elliptical path the Earth follows? Is it the solar system barycenter or is it the Sun's (wobbling) center of mass? In other words, is the Earth's orbit shifting as the Sun is tugged around, our distance from the Sun never varying by more than the eccentricity of the ellipse, or do we orbit the solar system barycenter, and our distance from the Sun varies by the sum of our orbital eccentricity plus the amount the Sun wobbles in its own orbit around the barycenter? "
2623,Why can we still see 10 billion year old galaxies?,I've never fully understood why we can still see galaxies that are 10 billion light years away. The age of the universe is calculated to be 13.9 billion years old and we live on a planet that it is roughly 4 billion years old. The universe came into existence 13.9 billion years ago and expanded incredibly quickly but those galaxies that were created in those early years are still visible to us via the amazing Hubble telescope (see the latest from Hubble). Those galaxies would surely have long gone so why can we still see the light from so long ago? How can we see further and further back to the beginning of the universe because surely the light from the moment of the big bang and subsequent eons would have past by us long ago? 
2624,"For stars around 13th magnitude, are their entries in various catalogues usually linked, or does one do this manually?","@MikeG's speedy answer to ""What star was the asteroid 2014 MU69 predicted to occult on 2018-08-04?"" lists three names for one 13th magnitude star, from three catalogues; 2MASS, UCAC4, and Gaia DR2.  My question could be slightly subjective, but I believe that someone familliar with the topic will be able to provide an authoritative answer.  For stars around 13th magnitude that do appear in all three, are they electronically linked between catalogs in some automated way, or do you pretty much check each of them, decide the objects are the same, and then make note of your conclusions if you are writing something up?   2MASS All-Sky Catalog of Point Sources (Cutri+ 2003)  UCAC4 Catalogue (Zacharias+, 2012)  Gaia DR2 (Gaia Collaboration, 2018)   "
2625,Why are some universal entities round and others are flat?,"I've been wondering for a while now why some objects in the universe (such as stars, planets, etc.) are round, while others are flat (galaxies, planetary rings and protoplanetary disks).  I know these shapes come to be because of gravity. In planets, the gravity from the core pulls everything to the centre, thus, rounding the planet (same with stars). But with Saturn, for example, why have its rings formed as rings and not as a spherical layer of ice surrounding the planet?  The same with the Kuiper belt and asteroid belt, I would presume the mechanics there are the same as with a planetary orbit, hence, why they are belts and not clouds. But then what about the oort cloud? Why is that a huge cloud in the outermost solar system and not a huge ring of ice.  As for the solar system itself, I've read that the solar system is kind of egg-shaped, but shouldn't it be just like the galaxy (or the other way round)?  I've tried looking into this and wondering about what different laws of physics may apply in each case, but it's all really confusing. "
2626,"Connection between Earth, Moon, Theia, and asteroid belt?","Are there other fragments aside from the Moon that resulted from the collision of Earth and ""Theia"" (as it's called in recent main-stream press stories)?  And if not, why not?  And what happened to ""Theia"" (like were did it go?)  Has there been any consideration or hypothesizing that Earth may have had a larger orbit (say between Mars/Jupiter) until a large body (Theia) bashed into it, sending Earth closer to the sun along with its new satellite, while also creating the asteroid-belt?  Could something like Ceres be the missing ""Theia""?  I know it sounds a bit far-fetched, but then so does the whole concept of the Moon being born from a planet collision with Earth (with very little evidence to back it up, at least till recently). "
2627,Question about tidal forces and the Roche limit,"As we know, an object that is beyond the Roche limit doesn't disintegrate (obviously) because the tidal forces upon the object are weaker than the gravitational pull of the object towards its centre, so the planet remains intact.   My question is: if that's so, why does the body deform even before crossing the Roche limit?   If the gravitational pull of the particles in the object outweighs the tidal forces, wouldn't the object have to stay totally round? There couldn't have been any deformation because the tidal forces are totally cancelled out. "
2628,"How to get the axial tilt vector(x,y,z) relative to ecliptic","According to the orbital plane XYZ, I understand that the axial tilt is the angle between the planet axis rotation and any normal of the plane (actually Z in right handed system). BUT, this is not sufficient to define a vector direction, I need another angle into the XY plane. Where do I find this information?  Actually I believe it's relative to the direction of the periapsis. Am I right?  Following all the nice conversation on the answers, I maybe need to ask   How to get the axial tilt vector(x,y,z) relative to ecliptic or orbital plane, given ONLY ONE angle, i.e. 23.439281 deg for the Earth, 25.19 for Mars, etc. "
2629,How is “surface brightness dimming” derived from redshift in the NED extragalactic database,"I have several questions regarding “Surface Brightness Dimming” in the “Quantities Derived from Redshift” section of the Nasa/ipac Extragalactic Database.  As an example, please use quasar IRAS F08279+5255 with the redshift z=3.9122  For Surface Brightness Dimming NED lists Flux Density per Unit Area=0.00172, and Magnitude per Unit Area=6.913 mag.  1) Am I correct in understanding that 99.828% of the flux from this quasar is attenuated, and that any absolute magnitude calculated by the distance modulus equation has to be corrected by -6.913?  2)  Please let me know the physical cause of this dimming. Is it light absorption / scatter by the intergalactic medium, or some phenomenon related to the expansion of the unverse?  3)  To which photometric band would the specified value apply?  4)  If possible, please give me the equation relating redshift, z, to flux or magnitude dimming. I can find absolutely nothing on the web. NED specifies that this dimming is derived from the redshift alone.  Thank you. "
2630,How massive must a rocky body be to liquify adequately to eliminate internal mass concentrations that could disrupt natural satellite orbits?,"Maybe a slightly weird question, and maybe more appropriate for some future geophysics SE, but I feel like this is what questions like Do moons have moons? are really driving at, and it just almost gets answered there.    How massive must a rocky body be to liquify adequately to eliminate internal mass concentrations that could disrupt natural satellite orbits?  I understand geothermal energy to be a function of both gravitation and fissionable material in the planetary body, so an ideal answer would at least state its assumptions in regards to the amount of energy from fissionable material present. "
2631,Question about the Figure-eight periodic planar three-body motion,"  If this is a posible periodic solution for a three-body problem, can anybody tell me where is the center of mass of the system? As we know, in a n-body problem the bodies orbit around their center of mass, but here I don't know where it is. Can anybody help me? Thanks. "
2632,Can we detect the wobble of neighbouring stars around their barycenters?,"The wobble of a star around its barycenter is interesting (the wobble caused by the pull of the rest of the solar-system on the sun).  This question explains why we don't see this wobble from within our own solar-system (because we are mostly orbiting the sun, and not our solar-system's barycenter): What point does Earth actually orbit?  But is it possible to detect from here on Earth, the wobble of neighbouring solar-systems relative to the wobble of our solar-system? "
2633,Can the shape and fluctuations of the heliopause be attributed to specific nearby stars and clusters?,The heliopause is where the Solar wind is counter balanced by the particle winds from other stars. This boundary seems to not be spherical and also to fluctuate in shape.  Can the shape of the heliopause be estimated by the pressure from surrounding stars and open clusters?  Can the fluctuations be attributed to specific stars in the Solar neighborhood? Are there single stars both so active and so nearby that they dominate the fluctuations of the Heliopause? Did Voyager in effect observe the effects of a specific event on a specific star's surface when the heliopause boundary billowed back and forth over it?  
2634,How big can a crater get?,"What is the biggest possible crater from an asteroid impact? Not asking for the biggest existing crater in the solar system. I should be able to find plenty of lists online. What I'm curious about is how big a crater can form before the impact results in both bodies reforming destroying near all evidence of the crater itself.   I don't mind erosion or normal geological processes  destroying the craters. That is just a matter of time.   Eg when the Mars size object hit the Earth. Both were substantially altered and incorporated in each other. Earth experienced a near complete reformation (in the spherical sense). Also resulted in the moon's formation. Obviously that sort of impact doesn't leave an 'obvious' crater.  I assume the makeup (mineral, size, speed, angle of impact etc) of both bodies will change the answer, so maybe a just a short list of sizes for the various xommon combinations?  Eg what would be the biggest crater possible on Earth before the Earth experienced severe...Um, reshaping? "
2635,Can the Sun be used as a point source of light to achive better focus?,"There's a limit to how well sunlight can be focused by a parabolic reflector or a lens because the Sun is not a point source. I wonder if the sunlight could be engineered to work as if it was (much more similar to) a point source.  If almost all of the Solar disc was covered by a coronograph, the light which gets through a small hole would be (almost) a point source. Is that correct?  If then an array of such covered reflectors or lenses concentrated their light to one and the same point, would a better focus be achieved than without covers? "
2636,What is the likely closest encounter for a typical star during the Milky Way Andromeda Merger?,"This is closely related, but distinct question to What are the chances of a star colliding with another during a galactic collision?.  The accepted answer to that question places the odds of the Sun colliding with another star at about [tex], what I want to ask is how near a near-miss is expected? In other words, what is the expected closest encounter between the Sun and another star during the collision? A more sophisticated answer would give the expected distribution of close encounters by distance.    A more general version of the question is -- what disruptive events would a typical star such as the Sun expect to experience during the merger? "
2637,How much star can star fusion fuse if star fusion can fuse hydrogen?,During stellar nucleosynthesis a star will convert a portion of its hydrogen atoms into helium.  Is there a constant of how many tons of hydrogen is converted based on the mass of the star?  Is it based on a percentage of the star's mass? Or can it vary? A Nasa blurb stated that 600 million tons of hydrogen per second are consumed by our own sun. Is there a mathematical formula that can tell you how much any star would consume and convert to helium? 
2638,Using the Sun as a Gravitational Lens,Can the Sun be used as a gravitational lens to achieve better telescopic viewing? Can this effect be practically used to view celestial objects? 
2639,Total angular momentum in system of binary brown dwarfs on wide orbit from primary star,"I want to calculate the total angular momentum of a system in which two brown dwarfs are orbiting one another (P ~ 10 years), and this system is stably orbiting a third primary ZAMS star (P ~ [tex] years). I was thinking of approaching this question from a Hamiltonian mechanics perspective, but the problem doesn't become easier in the rotating reference frame.   Let A denote the primary star, and B,C denote the two components of the binary. I was thinking the angular momentum would simply be the sum of rotational (S) and orbital angular (L) momentums: $$ L_{tot} = S_{A} + S_{B} + S_{C} + L_{BC} + L_{A+BC} $$  However, I am both worried that I am partially ""double counting"" with the last term and I don't really know how to treat the last term. Do I treat BC like a single mass at their barycenter?   If there is a Hamiltonian method to approach this problem, I am all ears.  The question I am actually concerned with is what would the rotation rate of the primary star be if the total angular momentum of the system was in the primary star? But I would really just like an accurate description of the angular momentum of the system to do this. "
2640,Supermassive black holes at the center of galaxies,"The fact is, many, if not most large galaxies have a supermassive black hole at their center. My question is why? Is it because when these galaxies were first formed supermassive black holes were created out of super-dense clouds of matter, which then attracted the rest of the galaxy? Or is the black hole attracted to the center of the galaxy in such a way that due to its large mass and ability to perturb everything around it, the interactions with the galaxy tend to move the center to where the black hole is located?  It seems interesting that Sagittarius A* is at the precise center of the galaxy, when it has so much less mass than the rest of the galaxy put together. The sun being at the center of the solar system makes a lot of sense - it accounts for 99.8% of the mass of the solar system. But the mass of Sagittarius A* is on the order of one millionth the mass of the galaxy.  So, to phrase it like a chicken and egg problem – what came first, the super-massive black holes, or the galaxies surrounding them? "
2641,Is the expansion accelerating or Decelerating?,"According to Hubble's Law, the farther a galaxy is, the farther it is moving away. But do we take into account the fact that we are actually looking in the past?  For example, there are two galaxies A and B at distance of 5 and 10 billion years respectively. Now, when we observe A we are looking at how it was moving 5 billion years ago. The same applies for B. So, now we conclude that 5 billion years ago space was expanding at a slower rate while it was expanding comparatively faster 10 billion years ago. What's wrong with this conclusion? "
2642,The formation of new stars as depicted in Feynman's lectures,"I've stumbled upon this curious passage addressing the formation of stars in Feynman's lectures on physics:     Whether we have ever seen a star form or not is still debatable.   Figure 7–12 shows the one piece of evidence which suggests that we   have. At the left is a picture of a region of gas with some stars in   it taken in 1947, and at the right is another picture, taken only 7   years later, which shows two new bright spots.   While I fully agree with Feynman's later note† that it's extremely unlikely that this picture shows stars forming, what does it actually show?  There is no reference to it, and no mention of filter used, the physical scale or even of the celestial object shown, and I've gotten rather curious as to what the seven-year change represents. Variable stars? Or is the displacement due to proper motions? Film artifact? Something else entirely?  Figure in question (Source):    † Feynman concludes the paragraph with ""[has the star formation somehow occurred?] Perhaps, and perhaps not. It is unreasonable that in only seven years we should be so lucky as to see a star change itself into visible form; it is much less probable that we should see two!"" - indeed, the star formation rate of the whole Galaxy would be of this order! "
2643,Obtaining TESS input catalog (TIC) IDs for Gaia `source_ids`?,"The TESS input catalog (TIC) ""uses the GAIA DR2 catalog as a base"" according to the catalog's website. The Gaia DR2 database provides source_ids for each observation of a target. I want to get the TIC number for a target based on the Gaia source_id. Is there an accepted way of doing this that I'm missing?  To be more specific, I can get a list of Cepheids from Gaia DR2 using their archive and the ADQL command select * from gaiadr2.vari_cepheid. The first result has the Gaia source_id as 4052922352453886976. How can I find the TIC number for this target star? Is the best way of doing this using the RA and DEC of the Gaia observation and finding the closest match in the TIC? Since the TIC is based on the Gaia DR2, I would assume there would be a direct corresponding target and finding the closest RA and DEC match would be unnecessary. "
2644,What suggests the cyclic nature of the universe? Proposed by Stephen Hawking,"In ""A Briefer History of Time"" by Stephen Hawking he writes that if we were to travel faster than the universe were expanding and for long enough (in a straight line) we would eventually come back to the point we started.  What suggests that the universe is cyclic in nature as this suggests? Or what led him to come to this conclusion? "
2645,Burning Out Stars,"In the book ""A Really Short History Of Nearly Everything"", I read that the larger the star is, the faster it burns itself. Whys that? Wouldn't there be more energy to burn if it's larger, and just be brighter? Our sun can burn for billions of years, but a planet bigger than our sun will only burn for millions of years. Why is that? "
2646,How many times has the sun orbited the galaxy?,"Even if our solar system is not in a stable orbit around the center of the galaxy (is it?), since the birth of our sun, how far has it traveled relative to the center of the galaxy? "
2647,Can a telescope be built to focus on a point source star?,"If a Kepler telescope were built to focus on one point source star at a time, would it provide more information, or did Kepler capture virtually every photon from any given star anyway?  In order to study known transit events more closely one star at a time, to possibly detect moons or atmosphere or rings by resolving the transit light curve's shape better, is a larger aperture necessary or would a smaller field of view help? What field of view would be optimal for observing a single point source? "
2648,Does mass create space?,"Imagine two cubes each with the side 1 light year. One of the cubes is empty of any matter. The other cube contains a massive star.   Does the cube which contains the massive star have a larger volume than the empty cube? (Because the mass makes space curvy) If the star is replaced by a gas cloud of the same mass but which is evenly distributed inside the cube, does the volume of the cube change? Is it not enough with geometry to calculate volumes? Is knowledge of the mass (and its distribution?) also necessary? Does mass (concentrations) create new space volume, or does it just change the properties of the space around it?  "
2649,"How much difference did the supply of ""fresh"" r-process elements make to the Solar System.?","In one of the answers to this question @MartinKochanski made the interesting point that the abundance of elements heavier than iron (r-process elements) in the solar system is probably due to a fairly recent and close (at the time) neutron star merger -- a relatively rare event on a galactic scale.  This means the early solar system was enriched with ""fresh"" r-process elements, as compared to the ""stale"" r-process elements that would be typical. For instance the early solar system is conjectured to have been rich in uranium and thorium compared to a ""typical"" system.  So my question is what differences might this have made to the formation and evolution of the solar system? Would it have had any bearing on the origins of life on Earth? "
2650,Stellar Mapping and Coordinates,"Why are the Galactic Coordinates not aligned so that the Axes go through the Long Bar Y-axis aligned to it's longer side, positive with Sol, and the X-axis align to the center of the short length with Sol being in the negative? Z should obviously be on the galactic plane where it generally is I think...  I'm curious about whether there is a reason we shouldn't align it like this? It seems to make the most sense to me where as the current system, while I understand it, to me is just to Earth-centric, especially when we have something that stands out so much on the galactic scale you could use to figure out where you are with where as Where Sol is being 0,0,0 isn't really helpful to anyone unless you're already on Earth ^.^    The other part of my question is less ""real"" and more of a ""I would like to know if there are any problems with doing this that I am unaware of"" thing...  There are 3 question areas...    1 I use a unit I call a Lida, It is 24 terameters long and roughly equivalent to a Light Day. On this map distances will be measured in Lida, more specifically, KiloLida. 1 Sector = [tex] 1 Block = [tex] 1 Grid = [tex] 1 Octant = [tex]  Each of the bigger areas contains 1000 of the next smaller unit down and can easily be referenced by 3 digits. So if I said Grid 346 that would reference the Grid in that Octant where each of those digits are xyz starting from the Galactic Center. Lower numbers are always closer, higher are always further from the Galactic Center.  Why not use parsecs and light years? They're really not practical to use. Likewise, AU are weird, and other units you either end up with very long numbers or poor conversions. Also with this unit, I find it very easy to work out distance and time in my head. The answer is 1.07% off, but that's not really an issue when you're not trying to be 100% precise.  Why use 20kL rather than 10kL or 1kL not many stars in that volume from what I looked at before so it makes sense to use that as division and it also divides up nice to the higher divisions.    2 I use another unit.   1 brut = [tex]  The largest reason I'm using this is that scientific notation doesn't work in emergencies or common parlance so it makes sense to me to have a larger base unit when dealing with these larger scales. [tex], if I remember right (cuz I came up with this a few years ago and haven't used it since), comes from when the reference point numbers on the wiki for scale started getting fishy looking to me. Not a hard science thing, but seemed like a good place to have something like this.    3 This is the way I label Stars, planets, moons, etc... because it makes sense. I keep saying that, but you know, it's true ^.^  SO I - Star (or black hole) SO II - Spheroid    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Brown Dwarf (Star?)    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Gaseous Spheroid - 12,000+ km radius and above (Most of its size is from gases)    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Terrestrial Spheroid - 1,500 to 12,000 km radius (Has a rocky mantle)    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Icey Spheroid - 200m to 1,500 km radius (Has an ice-water mantle) SO III - Debris    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Asteroid - Comprised mainly of rock    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Comet - comprised mainly of ice-water    Child Star (?) - SO I that orbits a SO I Planet - SO II that orbits a SO I Moon - SO II that orbits a SO II ?? (currently also called a moon it seems) - SO III that orbits a SO II  SO means Stellar Object. both SO and Spheroid are kinda bad names considering nothing but stars are Stellar and stars are Spheroids, but whatever, I think it gets the point across. Though I wish I could think up something better.    Anyways, do any of these 3 things create problems that I don't know about or that could cause a problem that I possibly can't see due to being a pleb in these matters? "
2651,Outside of a Universe and its origin,"Per the Big Bang Theory, the universe was formed from a dense singular point which existed 13 billion years ago and has been expanding ever since. This suggests that the point should have existed somewhere in space implying an outer universe. If we call this point the ""Universe"", then what do we call the space that held that point? Also how did this single point come into existence in the first place? "
2652,Expansion of space or constriction of length scales?,"According to wikipedia,      ""Technically, neither space nor objects in space move. Instead it is   the metric governing the size and geometry of spacetime itself that   changes in scale. Although light and objects within spacetime cannot   travel faster than the speed of light, this limitation does not   restrict the metric itself. To an observer it appears that space is   expanding and all but the nearest galaxies are receding into the   distance. ""   I kind of like the idea that length scales changes over time so that the universe appears to expand even if there is no movement, if this is how it is supposed to be interpreted.  Now in general relativity we have that time, energy and velocity of light basically co-variates within a gravitational field in a special way that makes the laws of physics appear the same even if different observers at different spatial locations and sometimes at different velocities will sometimes disagree.  Is the expansion of space thought of as a similar scenario where observes in different temporal locations agrees on the laws of physics but may disagree on the length scales used in the physical expression?  Questions:  1.Can we say that what we perceive as one meter today was perceived as less then one meter at earlier epochs and this is why we a little bit sloppy says that ""space is expanding""?  2.If the answer to question 1 is ""yes"",are there any variables co-variating with the change of length scales? I mean in a gravitational field due to general relativity we have the rate of time, velocity of light and energy (gravitational redshift, blueshift) covariating in a special way, do we have something similiar when we look at ""expansion of space""? "
2653,Observations of a perigee coincident with a full Moon,"Hopefully this will be a quick and easy question, with a quick and easy answer, but why is it that we observe a perigee Moon coincident with a full Moon approximately every 13 months? Is this related to the Earth-Moon dynamics, perhaps the eccentricity of the lunar orbit? "
2654,What is the difference between gas and dust in astronomy?,"Is there a strict difference between gas and dust? In Earthly environment most things become gaseous if heated enough. The temperature of interstellar medium seems to range mostly between 10 and 10 000 Kelvin. Is gas/dust an analog for hot/cold, or does the phase diagram of the element in question matter too? Can metals and molecules be gas in astronomical terms? "
2655,How are black holes doors to other universes?,I'm watching MIT OpenCourseWare lectures on general relativity and not too long into the first lecture the professor stated that the Kerr Black Hole solution allowed for travel between universes. How is that possible to know? How does one derive this/come to this conclusion? 
2656,Is there mass i.e a physical bottom to a black hole?,"All matter has a gravitational pull, a ball, a rock, a planet and a star - the bigger the matter the more it affects the space fabric around it thus having a greater gravitational pull.  I see black holes in the same kind of concept - matter that warps the space fabric/time around it - however as we can physically see a ball, a rock, a planet and a star I fail to visualize what would be the matter that continues a black hole to operate because we cannot see any physical element to it.  EXAMPLE   A black hole is cause when a star implodes on itself and crushes its self to an extent that gravity has such an effect on space time that we know of nothing that produce such a force.  What I would like to know is:  1: Is there a known ""bottom"" of a black hole? If so, what happens to all of the matter it swallows? surely it would be impossible to crush something so small that it physically no longer exists - where would it go then?  2: How small does the core of a collapsed star crush itself into? i.e the size of an atom or smaller? "
2657,"How would a Fast Fourier Transform Telescope work without a mirror, dish or lenses?","I recently came across a short article mentioning the idea for a telescope built without mirrors or lenses that instead uses an array of antennas and massive computing power to resolve an image. Such a thing will apparently become possible if ""Moore's law continues to hold"", but doesn't explain how it will work.  Here's a link to the original paper: Tegmark and Zaldarriaga 2009     We will show that it acts much like a single dish telescope with a   dramatically larger field of view, yet is potentially much cheaper   than a standard interferometer with comparable area. If a modern   all-digital interferometer such as the MWA 1 is scaled up to a very   large number of antennas N , its price becomes completely dominated by   the computing hardware cost for performing of order N2 correlations   between all its antenna pairs. The key idea behind the FFT Telescope   is that, if the antennas are arranged on a rectangular grid, this cost   can be cut to scale merely as N log2 N using Fast Fourier Transforms.   As we will see, this design also eliminates the need for individual   antennas that are pointable (mechanically or electronically),   Unlike a traditional interferometer, which consists of individual telescopes that focus light (or radio waves) to a point before ultimately combining their images, the antennas don't have a dish that focuses the radio waves from a certain point in the sky. Instead it's just an array of antennas that images the entire sky at once:     The results above also show that the FFTT can be thought of as a cheap   maximally compact interferometer with a full-sky primary beam.  To   convert a state-of- the-art interferometers such as MWA 1, LOFAR   [2], 12 PAPER[4], 21CMA [3] into an FFTT, one would need to do three   things:         Move all antenna tiles together so that they nearly touch.   Get rid of any beamformer that “points” tiles to- wards a specific sky direction by adding relative phases to its component antennas, and   treat each antenna as independent instead, thus allowing the array to   image all sky directions simultaneously.   Move the antennas onto a rectangular grid to cut the correlator cost from N2 to N log2 N .      Can someone explain how a computer can resolve an image without a lens, dish or mirror to make parallel rays of light converge on a sensor? I thought that a sensor without a lens, dish or mirror will just produce a blurry mess.  Edit: I think I understand it now. Watching this video was massively helpful for me in understanding how Fourier transformations allow you to isolate individual waveforms from a signal containing many different waveforms. "
2658,"Help in determining the features of an unusual, fictional star system","(Hope this is the right Stack-exchange site for this question) I'm working on a sci-fi RPG campaign, set on a very atypical location. Since this is a work of fiction, there's enough room for speculation and artistic license. But I'd still like to start from a more astronomically sound perspective.   Background  Consider the following system:   A single moon, with properties roughly comparable to Earth's so that it can support human life (1G gravity, Nitrogen-Oxygen-Carbon atmosphere, soil and liquid water etc.). This moon is tidally locked with it's planet. A single gas-giant planet, with a size roughly comparable to Saturn. Orbiting it's star so that it completes a cycle about every 12 earth years. A Star, larger than Sol and emitting enough energy to keep the moon in a comfortably warm temperature.   The features above may be altered to ensure possibility of human survival on the moon, and if possible, to keep the moon tidally locked with a large planet.  Now, the complications (inspired by a short story by Larry Niven):   The whole system (star, planet and moon) are traveling at a relativistic speed across the galaxy. (Based on the theory that some parts of the universe might be made from anti-matter) The whole system is made from anti-matter, but is currently traveling through a normal-matter area of space. Note: the ""human life"" on the moon are also based on anti-matter...   Finally, the story will begin with a small community of primitive ""anti-matter humans"", living on the moon in a place from which the planet fully visible, and at the zenith.   The Questions  I'd appreciate ideas, insights and comments on the following:   From the moon, how will the sky look like? What will the equivalent of a ""day and night cycle"" (sun-up to sun-up) look like? Will the winds on the moon have any ""non-earthlike"" patterns? Considering that at relativistic speeds, the odds of the bodies in the system hitting hydrogen particles in the vacuum of interstellar space are significant (is that even correct?), will that create any special aura or energy streams from the sun or planet?   Thank you for your help. "
2659,Angles of sunrise and sunset viewed from a surface anyway oriented,"I need to understand how to calculate the angles of the sunrise and sunset viewed from a surface oriented against the azimuth and  the horizon plane, and for any day of the year.  For example, I have a surface at this position 40° 43' 30.2""N 73° 59' 37.5""W, oriented towards north with an azimuth angle of 174°(O° is exactly the geometric south), and with a tilt angle of 90°,so the surface is vertical, or perpendicular to the horizon.   How could I calculate when it get the sun and when it doesn't during the day?  What are these angles against the azimuth axis?  In my example, sun should hit the surface when it rises, then it disappears, it reappears at the end of the day before of its set, mainly in the summer season. So in this case, I need to know four angles: -ws,w1,w2,ws, where -ws, and ws are the regular angle of rise and set, but how to calculate when sun disappears (w1), and appears again to the surface (w2)?   Do you know the complete formulas to these calculations?   Do you know any websites, or any web app to do exactly these type of calculations?   What about the regular case when the same surface in the same place and position but with its normal towards south?   I'm not very interested in the theory but in the practical calculation. I tried the formulas on this website ([website]"
2660,How Did Early Astronomers Measure Distances?,"Prior to the era of radar and other forms of radio/RF/EM ranging, what approaches, methods, and techniques did early astronomers (e.g., Kepler, Cassini, Copernicus) use to measure the distance(s) from Earth to various objects (such as: Mars, Venus, Alpha Centauri, etc.)?

2662,Map projections used for star maps,"I'm working on a star map program and I'm wondering what are the most common map projections used to print star maps...? I want to map of the entire visible sky from a certain point on the surface of Earth. I have all the visible stars and their Altitude-Azimuth, but I need to map this semi-sphere onto a circle in 2D.   I'd like to get something like this:     I've been playing around with equidistant and gnomonic (-1 RE) projections but they feel too distorted. What are the most common projections used for 2D, circular, entire-visible-sky star maps? "

2664,How long can afterglow last after a fireball?,"I was watching the YouTube video Perseid Meteor Shower - Mojave Desert, California which looks East before sunrise, presumably in mid-August of 2016.  I've made a GIF of a few seconds near the beginning where a fireball appears at about 00:03 in the video, and a faint luminescent trail appears to drift and change shape. I've timed the two stars in Orion Bellatrix and Betelgeuse and the motion is about seven seconds of video to move about 30 minutes in R.A. (near declination 0), so based on that the three or four second visibility in the video works out to about 10-15 minutes.  Is this common? Am I interpreting what I'm seeing correctly? Is such luminosity visible by eye, or only using a camera with a good lens?   "
2665,Are there large underground caverns on Mars?,"Scientists talk about the possibility of life underground on Mars, and I assume they are talking about microscopic life that can live in small gaps in the soil or rock.  But is there any evidence that there might be large caverns under the surface of Mars relative to the human scale or even larger?  Then I wonder how could we even detect or map such subsurface features on Mars or other rocky bodies in the solar system such as Titan, Venus, or even the Moon.  Could we use radar or maybe sonar for bodies with substantial atmospheres from an orbiting spacecraft?  Are there other methods for detecting sub-surface cavities?  "
2666,How did the lighter elements end up in the center of the solar system? Solar System Formation,"The previous generation of stars famously are the origin of all the heavier elements (up until iron?) in the solar system. So a big portion of the solar system mass actually is made up of Carbon, Silicon, Iron and the like because of that. But in the center, and only in the center, there is a star with presumably almost no heavy elements inside. How can that be? Am I wrong about the actual mass concentrations or is there really an imbalance, i.e. is the element distribution really lighter towards the center of the solar system? I would presume that the previous generation of stars just ended in a more or less uniform cloud of debris, from which the solar system formed. But if so, why aren’t there star systems where the star has a very different composition and is kind of a spluttering, dirty fusion machine (metaphorically, I mean)? "
2667,A good definition of specific intensity?,"I’m studying specific intensity for a course on astronomical instrumentation. I can’t quite get my head around the proper definition of the term.  One definition I’ve found in various lecture notes / books / powerpoint slides online is that specific intensity is the power per unit frequency INCIDENT upon a unit area INCIDENT from a unit solid angle. An often given example, for instance in the book of Lena, is that if a telescope records a power P from a star, incident from a solid angle S onto a pixel of area A, then the specific intensity of the source would be P/SA per unit frequency.  Now the second definition I keep finding is that the specific intensity is the power per unit frequency, this time passing through a unit area falling into a unit solid angle.  My question is, are these two equivalent? From the 2D geometry equivalent , I know that an incident pencil of rays through a point causes the same pencil to come out again on the other side. But this feels wrong to appeal to, since the physical interpretations feel so different: incident light is very different from emergent light.   If my above interpretation is true, shouldnt there at least be a sign difference between the emergent and incident definitions such that the integral of the specific intensity over all solid angles yields 0 if no absorption/emission takes place? "
2668,What maintains the high orbital eccentricity of many exo-planets near their sun?,"Over the last decade we've discovered that many exoplanets not only have highly eccentric orbits, but also orbit very close to their sun. This is true of many classes of stars.  I definitely have a gap in my understanding, because I'm perplexed as to why the orbits don't circularize when the planets are so close to their star. The tidal forces can be immense, yet the proportionally large number of eccentric planets indicates that many are likely not circularizing (at least over time periods of a handful of giga years).   Why?   I don't understand the physics of this well enough to say. Could it have something to do with with spin-orbital resonance of the planet? A paper I found from Anthony R. Dobrovolskis titled Spin states and climates of eccentric exoplanets indicates that highly eccentric planets in the tidal-lock zone would likely lock into spin states other than 1:1. This could be 2:1, 3:2, etc. Much like mercury. Does the achievement of this spin-orbital resonance do something to preserve the eccentricity?   I'd appreciate any help that could be provided!   Update:   Because it was asked for, I've included a list of some exoplanets that have both short orbital periods as well as highly eccentric orbits (varying from ≈0.15 all the way up to around 0.5). Ages of systems vary widely or is not known, from possibly as low as about 2gy up to over 10gy.   [website][website][website][website][website][website]Possibly highly eccentric, but measurement delta is too large to confirm eccentricity above ≈0.11:  [website]Update 2:   More sources showing the existence of near-orbiting highly eccentric planets. While higher eccentricities are common farther out from a star, it looks like moderately high eccentricities (0.2, 0.3, 0.4) are not infrequent close-in to a star, particularly if the system lacks many other planets. Very high eccentricities are also possible close-in.      From: [website]""Eccentricity versus semimajor axis going from low (left) to high multiplicity (right).

2669,Is there a maximum Julian day?,"I have read various discussions of the Julian day, including that on the Wikipedia, but none of these appear to define the maximum Julian day or proleptic Gregorian year in which that maximum day would occur.  Is there a maximum Julian day? If so, what is it? "
2670,Are there any estimates for the combined mass of all near earth objects (NEOs)?,"I tried looking around but couldn't find any sources attempting to answer this particular question.  It's obviously impossible to know the exact answer, but all I'm looking for is an estimate.  My best guess would be that it's about a tenth (or less) of the mass of the asteroid belt, with a composition roughly 10-15% metallic and 85-90% carbonaceous or silicate.  Is anyone aware of any sources that attempt to give an estimate?  If not, what would you say is a reasonable estimate?   Thanks in advance.   "
2671,Complex life in binary black hole - Sun(s) system,"I was wondering if there could theoretically exist systems in which an Earth-like planet was in the habitable zone of one (or two) Sun-like star(s), while actually not orbiting around any star. To be more precise, I started asking myself whether a planet like earth could be placed in the inner orbit of a black hole, while one or a pair of Suns would be revolving around the black hole too, on an outer orbit.  My question is not whether such a system could actually exist somewhere, but only if it could theoretically exist, even if it is probabilistically not likely to exist.  So I found this sets of issues:   Planet must be far enough from the black hole ( > Roche Limit ) Harmful radiations from black hole's accretion disk Planet-Star relative distance must not vary too much...which I guess in turn means that the planet-blackhole distance must be small compared to the average blackhole-star distance   Given these limitations, how would you choose the stars and blackhole masses and their relative distances to the planet, in order to have it suitable for complex, perhaps intelligent forms of life? Do you see other issues to this purpose?  Below I add what I've been able to collect so far (more like a collection of unsolved questions..)  So, about the issue #1, I thought about a rather lightweight blackhole, with M &lt; 10 Solar masses. I once read in a thread that when considering a central body = 10 solar masses, and a satellite with a density of 5000 kg/m^3 (Earth's average density), then the Roche Limit would be as little as 0.8% of an AU. That would be conveniently small, though I guessed that using Earth's average density may not guarantee that the whole planet is kept together (it may lose its atmosphere...). So, just to be sure, would you rather increase this distance to 1/20 of an AU, perhaps less, perhaps more? I'm asking here because I'm not able to conduct these calculation myself.   Then again, I'm not an expert and I don't know if staying out of the Roche Limit is a sufficient condition for orbiting around a blackhole of this small size without things becoming nasty. I know of issue #2 though,and about that I read someone suggesting that If the planet were subjected to tidal lock, then at least the face looking away from the blackhole would be spared from the harming X rays. But how close a planet should get to a blackhole in order to experience a tidal lock within a reasonable amount of time? Would it likely be tidally locked if it stayed at 0.05 AU away from a 10 solar masses black hole? I guess the answer to be yes, but I wanted some validations from the experts here.  Then about issue #3 again, I thought that If there were two Suns (making another binary system of their own), then there would be also a larger insulating flux, perhaps allowing us to keep the Suns more far away (by a quick calculation I think I found that two Suns at 1.4 AU would give the same flux as one Sun at 1 AU). Another possibility is to have a brighter Star class, at expense of its life-time. So for simplicity let's say we can go up to 2 AU (maybe even more) without the Planet getting too cold, or the Stars too short-lived.  Summarizing, I now have a 10 Solar Masses black hole and a (likely) tidally locked earth-like planet orbiting at 0.05 AU from it. Tidal forces should still be small enough not to suck the planet's atmosphere. Perhaps having a planet slightly bigger than the Earth would also help in this account. Then we have a couple of Stars orbiting together around the black hole, at a distance of 2 AU. Relative distance from the twin Stars to the Planet is 2 +/- 0.05 AU. I guess that would be within the limits of the habitable zone, right?  One last curiosity: assuming the black hole has an ""average"" spin, would it be realistic if the two Stars had a tilted orbit with respect to the black hole spinning axis?  I'm sorry for the many questions, by any means please don't assume I'm expecting a single person to answer all of them. "
2672,Are astronomers continuously monitoring exoplanetary systems?,"I'm reading many of the Wikipedia pages about exoplanets and the different methods they are using to detect them.  But I wonder, it seems that the emphasis is on detecting and finding new exoplanets, but are astronomers continuously monitoring the exoplanets that have already been discovered?  For instance, if there is a collision between a detected exoplanet and a previously unknown planet, this could cause a change in some of the orbital parameters, and could be potentially detected.  If this happens, would we learn of this change, or will it have to wait until astronomers again take another look at the system? "

2674,A [very basic?] question about light scattering and colors,"Since the night two days ago, the moon here in Israel appears to be orange as it rises, and then gradually becomes white as it continues travelling across the sky.     This phenomenon comes in a great timing as I am starting to become interested in astronomy (I have no special knowledge in astronomy, just to make it clear). So I googled up and came across this explanation. I'll try to summarize: it says that it happens because of Earth's atmosphere, that tends to scatter short wave-lengths (such as blue and green) and let long wave-lengths (such as red and orange) pass through. When the moon rises, it's in the position where the light coming from it to our eyes goes through the thickest layer of atmosphere (as opposed to when it's high up in the night skies) and that gives the orange effect.  I totally get this explanation, but it raises a couple of questions for me, whose answers I couldn't find. Maybe you could help me out.    Why doesn't the orange moon phenomenon occur all the time? It does not happen quite often. What's so special about the past three nights? I mean, the rising moon's light always has to go through a thick atmosphere layer, doesn't it? Maybe that's not entirely astronomic, but, to complete the big picture - why does our atmosphere scatter short wave-lengths? This explanation suggests that all light coming to us from the sun is (at least) slightly reddish. Is this measurable (if true)? Because to the naked eye, sunlight refrected through a prism shows no tendency towards red.    Thank you for your time reading the question, I hope you could rescue me from my ignorance...  "

What I'm saying is, could this process occur in reverse? I.E:     black hole -> supernova -> particles form dust cloud -> new star   EDIT: Apologies if any of this sounds stupid (or vague), I'm just curious. "
2676,Effects of the solar tide on planets,"It’s well known that (lunar) tides on Earth result in a transfer of angular momentum from Earth proper to the Earth–Moon orbital motion. That’s why the Moon resides now in a high Earth orbit, and Earth’s axial rotation is nowadays much slower than in the past (Hadean, Archean etc.).  What about effects of solar tides, indeed? The angular momentum certainly must be transferred from Earth proper to the Earth–Sun orbital motion. Does it result in a tiny increase of (Earth+Moon)’s heliocentric orbital angular momentum over millenia? What about Mars and Ceres: does the solar tide brake their axial rotation and change slightly their orbits? And what about Venus: does its solar tidal braking explain the slowness of rotation completely?  Addendum. The solar tide may not be confused with “dual” effect: planetary tide on the central star. It exists as well and has much significance for (extrasolar) planets on near orbits — but this question is not about tides on Sun. Ī̲’d accept an answer assuming gravity of the Sun to be spherically symmetric, neglecting Sun’s deviation from spherical symmetry, as well as rotation (even going to account for General Relativity). The solar tide is interaction between this gravity and the orbiting object. By Newton’s laws, gravitation affects Sun’s momentum reciprocally (and, hence, velocity), and we may ignore here any effect on Sun beyond its translational motion (momentum/velocity/position). "
2677,Why are Bok globules so cold?,"I have recently read a bit a out Bok globules. One thing, that is repeatedly emphasised is that they are among the coldest objects in space, with a temperature of ~3 K.  Why is that so? Naively, I would expect the coldest objects to be far out in the super voids. Also, I would expect these globules to have retained heat from the gravitational collapse. After all, the kinetic energy of their free fall should be dissipated, shouldn't it?  Maybe someone can elaborate.  "
2678,How many galaxies disappear beyond the Hubble Bubble horizon every year now?,"The accelerating expansion of space means that the space between us and far away galaxies expands faster than light can travel through space. There is a horizon of possible observation beyond which galaxies disappear from us.  At what rate do galaxies, or some other measurement of mass/energy, disappear beyond that horizon at present rate? Will future telescopes actually see galaxies red shift themselves into oblivion? I imagine there being issues about the definitions of ""when"" and ""where"" in this context. Answers should try to address how they deal with that.  Since the radius of the observable universe expands at the speed of light, my intuition tells me that there should've been a point in time when the expansion of space balanced the arrival of light of more distant parts of space. if so, when did that happen?

2680,How are pulsars detected from Earth?,"This paper on Arxiv indicates that the signal period of known pulsars is 1 ms-15 s (0.07-1,000 Hz since F=1/T). I have an EE background and it's a long story how I ended up here, but suffice it to say I'm weak on astronomy.  This chart on Wikipedia implies that the entire range of pulsar frequencies should be absorbed by the atmosphere, but this guide and even this budget RF telescope writeup clearly state that pulsars can be detected from Earth's surface.  My questions is: how are pulsars detected from Earth--what am I missing here? Are RF telescopes simply that receptive? Any insights appreciated. "
2681,Terminology: planet plus atmosphere vs planet and atmosphere as separate things,"When discussing a rocky planet, is there any terminology to distinguish that you're talking about the whole thing, including the atmosphere, veruses that you're talking about the ocean + crust + mantle + core as a separate thing from the atmosphere?  Or do you have to depend upon context to make that distinction? "
2682,Why does the number of extrasolar planets vary in different sources?,There are at least three catalogues that are counting up-to-date discovered exoplanets. What criteria do they use to count the number of planets? Every catalogue has a different count value.  So at this moment various catalogues as:   exoplanet.eu Open exoplanet catalogue NASA exoplanet archive etc.   show values of confirmed number of exoplanets between approx. 3500 and 4050.  Why do they disagree with each other?

2684,Could images of (very) nearby targets be recovered from the EHT data,"Reading this question I was struck by the fact that the ""pointing"" of an interferometer is effectively done in the correlator, at least within the common field of view of all the telescopes, which is many thousands of times wider than the imaged area. Could the same data be reprocessed to reveal images of other ""tiles"" from this common field of view? Could it image the accretion disk, for example, or the base of the jets?

2689,Sensitivity of calculated orbital elements to observational errors,"These days, we have some very precise ways of making measurements, but I'm sure it wasn't so in Kepler's day. So I am wondering how astronomers of that time could make such accurate determinations of planetary orbits, given the likely limitations of the available instrumentation. To put the question another way: How does each added (or lost) digit of precision in the measurement affect the accuracy of the calculated orbital elements? Is there significant compounding of errors due to the nature of the calculations, or is it essentially one-for-one? How much accuracy (to how many digits of precision) must the ""three observations"" be in order to determine the orbital elements to a given precision? How does that precision degrade over time? If, for example, we wanted to prepare an almanac for Neptune that will be accurate to say, one second of arc in our sky after 100 years?  "

So, what is the real limit?  If the question has been already asked, please give me the link. "
2692,Is it plausible for a planet that is positioned in the habitable area of a solar system to have little extractable metals?,"I am big fan of Asimov's Foundation and I am wondering about the plausibility of some of Foundation's imagined words.  According to this article Terminus was a special world with little metals:     It was the sole planet orbiting its isolated star and had almost no   metals. The nearest planet was Anacreon, 8 parsecs (26 light years)   away. Being on the fringe of the galaxy, there are almost no stars in   the sky.   Since the planet hosted the first Foundation it is clearly habitable (i.e. atmosphere, no extreme temperatures). However, I am wondering how could it have so little metals if it seems so similar to Earth (habitability-wise) which has lots of metals. Is this possible in our Universe?   I am interested in answers that use current discovered exoplanets information or some articles that deal with planets come to be.   Question: Is it plausible for a planet that is positioned in the habitable area of a solar system to have little extractable metals? "
2693,Second Telescope: Maksutov Cassegrain vs Refractor,"I bought my first telescope, a 3inch refractor a few weeks ago.

I was considering :  Explore Scientific ED APO 102mm F/7 Bresser Maksutov Cassegrain 152mm F/12.5  I live in a high altitude region with Bortle 3 skies. I hope to see basic details on Jupiter, Satrun and Mars at high contrast and clarity and perhaps the disc of Neptune. Also occasionally deep sky objects. Portability and fast setup time are also a consideration. The MC is about 60% the price of the APO.   In addition to my 26 &amp; 12 mm Plossl eyepieces I plan on getting a 50mm Erfle (Field Stop 40mm) and a 6mm Plossl.  For mount I was contemplating between Bresser Exos 2 and iOptron CEM25P.  I wish to know your experience with refractors and MCs, in general or with these specific models. Since the MC is cheaper and has a bigger aperture , will the APO have any advantages eg.contrast ? Also what are your thoughts on the mounts?  Thank you. "

2695,"Is the boulder on the peak of Tycho Crater the core of the impactor, or is it a random rock?","There's a strikingly visible boulder sitting right at the top of the peak complex in the center of Tycho Crater on the Moon.  Is it just a coincidence that this gigantic, bright rock is sitting dead center of the peak complex or is it a known piece of the original impactor that caused the wider crater? Does this remarkable rock have a name?  Image source     On 10 June 2011 the LRO spacecraft slewed 65° to the west, allowing the LROC NACs to capture this dramatic sunrise view of Tycho crater. A very popular target with amateur astronomers, Tycho is located at 43.37°S, 348.68°E, and is ~82 km (51 miles) in diameter. The summit of the central peak is 2 km (6562 ft) above the crater floor, and the crater floor is about 4700 m (15,420 ft) below the rim. Many ""clasts"" ranging in size from 10 meters to 100s of meters are exposed in the central peak slopes. Were these distinctive outcrops formed as a result of crushing and deformation of the target rock as the peak grew? Or do they represent preexisting rock layers that were brought intact to the surface? Imagine future geologists carefully making their way across these steep slopes, sampling a diversity of rocks brought up from depth. Tycho's features are so steep and sharp because the crater is young by lunar standards, only about 110 million years old. Over time, micrometeorites, and not so micro meteorites, will grind and erode these steep slopes into smooth mountains. For a preview of what Tycho's central peak may look like in a few billion years, visit Bhabha crater.

2696,"How can cosmological bubble universes ""collide"" with each other?","In Eternal Inflation Theory, there exists the idea of multiple ""bubble"" Universes that grow and according to this theory, can ""collide"" with each other. The paper suggests that you can search for evidence that our Universe collided with other ""bubble"" Universes, by looking for an imprint on the CMB radiation.   However, the concept of a Universe existing as a bubble that moves relative to other universes makes no sense:   How can you have a space ""outside"" of ours that allows the Universes to move relative to each other? In what dimension are the other ""Universes"" moving relative to ours? If time started in our Universe at the Big Bang, then in what time dimension (outside of ours) do collisions between Universes occur?   PBS Spacetime looks at this idea here: [website]Edit: A winning answer will answer all three points above. "
2697,Apparent Ring of Craters on the Moon,"I saw this picture on the BBC news website.    There appears to be a ring of craters in the center of the picture, aligned in an approximate sub vertical orientation.  Am I just seeing things or does this apparent ring of craters a feature and does it extend to the far side of the moon? If it does exist, what form of bombardment or gravitational attraction would have create such a ring? "
2698,Using a telescope to look at the Earth History in Some Detail,The following paragraph is a scientific fact.  When we look distantly into the universe (with telescopes) we see galaxies  (or whatever else you see) as they were millions years  ago- in other words it is how they looked in the past (this is because of the speed of light).  So my question is could we build a technology (using current science or more speculative/theoretical science) using this scientific fact too see the earth history or past to such a level of detail that we could see historical events (e.g. individual dinosaurs) and the famous people's faces (in history books) - as if we were standing face to face with them- of the long ago past? What's the best level of detail could we theoretically see? 
2699,Could light be dark matter?,"Is it possible that light itself is dark matter?  I am speaking of photons (e.g. visible light, infrared, ultraviolet, etc...).  I realize light is understood to be massless, but it is obvious it at least contains energy because we can see with it (e.g. it energizes the cells in our retinas).  I wonder if light has a very tiny ""net mass"" (e.g. 0 mass * relativistically infinite speed).  I would think that light at least has a little mass, in proportion to its energy.  For example, take E=mc^2, then m = E/c^2 would describe how much mass it has.  If this is true, light should have a very little gravity too.  Although the effect would seem minimal, light is practically everywhere. Gravity from light would be more concentrated inside galaxies, and even more concentrated in the center of galaxies where there are many stars (like dark matter is).  It would be interesting to run the calculations, assuming light does have gravity, and see if this matches the gravitational observations of dark matter in the universe.  It would be funny and ironic if dark matter really is light.  Edit: Note that it appears light does have gravity as per the discussions here: How does light affect the universe?  If that much is true, I wonder if this is significant enough to account for dark matter? "
2700,Could a binary system of two planets with oceans reflect each other?,"If there were two earth-like planets in a binary system and one of them had landmasses, and the other one had oceans covering a significant amount of its surface, could you see the continents of the first planet reflected onto the oceans of the second one?  If so, could this also work with oceanic moons? "
2701,Sunrise and sunset times when compared between the vernal and autumnal equinoxes,"Why is it that sunrise and sunset occur at different times when compared between the vernal and autumnal equinoxes?   Consider Pontianak, Indonesia, 0 deg N, for simplicity. Timeanddate.com gives sunrise and sunset times 5:46 AM, 5:53 PM at 3/21 (vernal equinox) and 5:31 AM, 5:38 PM at 9/23 (autumnal equinox). Given the symmetry of the problem, I would expect that sunrise would occur at the exact same time during the two events. Same for sunset. What is the reason for the 15 minute difference between the time sunrise occurs on the vernal equinox and the time sunrise occurs on the autumnal equinox?    "

2704,Four Lights (star like) Moving in a Line Together,"About 20 minutes ago, we saw four lights lined up and moving relatively quickly across the sky. These lights looked exactly like the stars around them - not red or blue or flashing or anything, just four stars at first glance. The spacing between them remained constant as they traveled in a straight line together (moving from West to East). The two in the middle were slightly closer to one another than the two in the front and back of the line, but the spacing was otherwise equal and constant - as if they'd been strung together on a line that was begging pulled forward.   They moved as quickly as a plane might when making a final approach to land, but there were no other lights visible around them and no sound. After watching for a minute, I called a friend out to reassure me I wasn't just seeing things, but they saw the same and described them as resembling stars more than anything else as well.  Do satalites travel in groups? Would they form a consistent line like this? That's the next closest thing I can think of, but I've never seen satalites quite that bright/large or traveling in locked step with others.  Could these have been military planes flying high enough to only appear as one whitish, twinkling light but still as fast as a lower flying plane? There is a naval Base not to far from us; that's the only other thing I can think of.  "
2705,Why is the discovery of merging neutron stars important?,"I'm fairly certain people here will have heard about it, already, but apparently, two supernova leftovers clashed some 130 million years ago and some billion billion kilometres away ...  What I haven't heard yet, however, is why we should care.  I mean sure, it's an interesting phenomenon and measuring it can't have been easy.  But now that we've heard it ... what changes?  I'll admit it, I don't know particularly much about astronomy, but I'm curious:  What's the significance of having achieved this? Why does it matter whether or not we know? "
2706,Why look at an infrared telescopes's mirror with ultraviolet light? (Herschel Space Observatory),"While link-clicking for Where did Herschel Space Telescope go in 2013? I ran across the 2009 Time Magazine article Two Telescopes to Measure the Big Bang which shows the file photo below with the caption:     Herschel's 3.5-m diameter mirror is checked with ultraviolet light at Europeís Spaceport in Kourou, French Guiana T VALLEE/AFP/Getty   According to Wikipedia's Herschel Space Observatory the telescope covers a wavelength range from far-infrared to sub millimeter waves; 55–672 µm.  Why then check the mirror's figue with a wavelength 200 times smaller in the ultraviolet? Even visible light would have been more convenient, and there should be several IR bands where coherent sources and imaging detectors work even in the humid French Guiana climate.   "
2707,Is there any point on earth where the moon stays below the horizon for an extended period of time?,"When I was teaching a class why the earth has seasons today, I mentioned how the poles of the earth experience months of daylight and darkness. Then one of my students asked whether the moon disappears as well.  Using an orrery and a string, we looked at the orbit of the moon around the earth and tried to find a place where the moon was below the horizon for an entire orbit. In our attempts, we could find no such place, though some students speculated that if you were in the right place at the right time, the moon could make a full orbit while partially obscured by the horizon.  Is there a place on the earth where the moon cannot be seen on for long periods of time, like the sun in northern latitudes? Or does the fact that it orbits around the earth make this impossible? "
2708,"""If earth had rings like Saturn"": A few further thoughts on the consequences","I came across this video recently where artists depicted what it would look like if Earth had rings like Saturn. [website]Please note: The video contains already some information on what I ask here, but I can't assess its reliability, therefore I'd appreciate any scientific thoughts on it :)  1) Earth has roughly a distance of 1 AU to the sun, Saturn between 9 and 10. Sun's gravity would therefore have a much stronger influence on these rings. Would it already be enough to distort the rings (e.g. even leading to the sun ""stealing"" parts of it) or would the rings still have a ring shape?  2) How well would the objects in such rings be visible from earth? The Saturn rings are mostly dust and ice as far as I know, but there are surely some larger objects. Depending on material and size some object would probably be visible to the naked eye, right? Is there (probably yes) a formula to calculate what materials and sizes are required to achieve this?  3) Would those rings not be constantly raining particles down on earth? Would there be a much higher risk of dangerous impacts for the earth's population?  4) Are the colours used in the video precise? Don't they depend on the angle? What influence would our atmosphere have onto them?  5) Would those rings have the same orbital inclination or would theirs differ from earth's to an extent where the difference becomes visible?  6) What shadow would these rings cause on earth? Would they be dense enough to ""shade out"" complete stretchs of land?  I'm aware that these are hypothetical questions. But I find it, especially as an author of sci-fi and fantasy, nonetheless very interesting.  Thank you for your interest!  Pat "
2709,is there any theory or observational evidence that our universe is electrically neutral or not?,It seems our universe is neutral in large scale.  There is CP violationwiki problem about matter and dark matter.  Similarly is there any theory about whether our universe is electrically neutral?  Cosmic rays are not neutral. However the atomic nucleus and electrons are just separated. There should be no charge excess in total.  What is the largest scale that is severely non-neutral?  
2710,How to compare a Catadioptrics light asorbtion with a reflector?,"I used to have a 6"" Dobsonian reflector, and the next telescope I buy, I want it to have the equivlant of about a 11/12"" dobsonian reflector.

2711,Neptune's Internal Heat Source,"Unlike its sister planet Uranus,Neptune has a substantial internal heat source which gives rise to a dynamic atmosphere &amp; weather.   Wikipedia says:     As with Uranus, the source of this heating is unknown, but the discrepancy is larger: Uranus only radiates 1.1 times as much energy as it receives from the Sun; whereas Neptune radiates about 2.61 times as much energy as it receives from the Sun. Neptune is the farthest planet from the Sun, yet its internal energy is sufficient to drive the fastest planetary winds seen in the Solar System. Depending on the thermal properties of its interior, the heat left over from Neptune's formation may be sufficient to explain its current heat flow, though it is more difficult to simultaneously explain Uranus's lack of internal heat while preserving the apparent similarity between the two planets.   Have plausible theories been proposed for the source of the heat necessary to keep Neptune's ocean liquid?  Could there be sufficient methane in the atmosphere to produce a significant greenhouse effect? "

I have a clear view of the sky and a couple of days to make observations and calculations. Can I determine the current day of the week? Also, can I find the answer instantly?  On a related note, is it possible to define days of the week in a purely astronomical (e.g. planet-agnostic) manner such that for the Earth we get the traditional meaning? "
2714,Are binary neutron star mergers needed to explain the abundance of gold?,"The NPR News item Astronomers Strike Gravitational Gold In Colliding Neutron Stars mentions and quotes ""Daniel Kasen, a theoretical astrophysicist at the University of California, Berkeley:""     He spent late nights watching the data come in and says the colliding stars spewed out a big cloud of debris.      ""That debris is strange stuff. It's gold and platinum, but it's mixed in with what you'd call just regular radioactive waste, and there's this big radioactive waste cloud that just starts mushrooming out from the merger site,"" Kasen says. ""It starts out small, about the size of a small city, but it's moving so fast — a few tenths of the speed of light — that after a day it's a cloud the size of the solar system.""      According to his estimates, this neutron star collision produced around 200 Earth masses of pure gold, and maybe 500 Earth masses of platinum. ""It's a ridiculously huge amount on human scales,"" Kasen says. He personally has a platinum wedding ring and notes that ""it's crazy to think that these things that seem very far out and kind of exotic actually impact the world and us in kind of intimate ways.""   Has the merger of neutron star binaries been necessary to explain abundances of the heavy elements such as gold and platinum, or is this just an anecdotal item? How important are binary neutron stars for the abundances of heavy elements such as gold? Is there a particular or notable paper I can read on this?  I have already read this answer but I'm looking for a better explanation of the need for this kind of merger to explain abundances. I'm pretty sure there is nothing in any observed gamma ray events that shows spectral lines of gold or any identifiable heavy element (due to the incredible doppler broadening), so the connection must actually come from simulations.

2717,What is the galaxy M87 doing these days?,"The massive elliptical galaxy M87 in the Virgo cluster is 53,490,000 light years away. It also contains one of the largest, heaviest supermassive black holes in the known Universe. But it's also my understanding that the stellar population of this galaxy is mostly old, red supergiants. Is there any evidence for new star formation in M87? If there isn't, what is the fate of this galaxy and what is it like in modern times? That may be impossible to know for sure but what I wonder is if the remaining stars and matter in the galaxy have been swallowed up by central black hole which may be thousands of lightyears across by now.

2718,Is it possible to move a planet out of its orbit? At least a lighter planet?,"As observed by many researches our sun will be exhausted in the distant future. So does anyone think that driving our planet (or any planet) closer to the sun for more light and heat is a solution for life to survive on earth? Or would moving it out of the sun's gravitational field and taking it to some other solar system with a healthy star be better, possibly with some kind of thrusting mechanism that we may invent in future?  I am aware of the sun's gravity and the mass of the earth.  "

2720,What was the composition of the primordial asteroid belt?,"According to one theory, the region between Mars and Jupiter was once populated by several primordial planets with a combined mass of roughly the earth.  These planets provided the material that made up the original asteroid belt.  Since then, 99.9% of this material was lost.  The current composition of the asteroid belt is about 10% metallic and 90% silicate/carbonaceous.  Could we assume that the original asteroid belt had the same composition?  Or, at least a very similar composition?   "
2721,Orbital decay of the Earth's orbit and Earth's moving closer to the Sun,"If we consider orbital decay of the Earth's orbit, then can we counter argue with the following reasons?   Due to tidal effects transferring small amounts of angular momentum from the Sun's spin to Earth's orbit, can we conclude that Earth's orbit is actually moving slightly further away from the Sun? Can we say that the orbit is increasing in size because the sun loses millions of tons of mass each day, mostly to the ejection of particles called solar winds?  "
2722,Sun path at poles,"At places other than the poles, the sun is seen to ""rise"" on the Eastern horizon and to ""set"" on the Western horizon. After a period of night, the sun ""reappears"" on the Eastern horizon.  At the poles, during the short periods of 24-hour daylight, what does the sun path look like? Where does the sun move after it has reached its Western most position? Back Eastwards along the same path in reverse? "
2723,What is the time/size/rigidity ratio for a space object to become mostly round?,"In the answer here multiple comets are identified that do not form a single round body.    A drop of water will form a round shape in the time it takes to free fall a couple of feet.    All of the moons and planets in our solar system are essentially round.  Based on observable data, I assume that there is a relationship between the size, rigidity and the passage of time; that will result in all objects subject to only their own gravitational influences (Given: no body is ever truly uninfluenced by others) becoming spherically shaped (round).  Any object that is in microgravity and not round, therefore must be either very rigid and/or very newly formed.    What is the ratio or formula for calculating any one factor when the other two are known?     Note There would be other factors as well, speed of rotation, elasticity and energy of areas moving in opposition.  But I think these (and others?) would be minor compared to the other three.   "

2725,How is a day measured on a gas giant?,"After watching this JPL video of a Cassini time lapse of Saturn, I wondered since being mostly gases, how do we know how long a day—one rotation period—is?  Is there a usable relation between how fast the upper most layer of gases is and the planet's solid core? "
2726,Is there evidence for the speed of gravity?,"Is it an assumption that the speed of propagation of gravitational waves is exactly the same as the speed of light? If the speed of gravity is only slightly less than the speed of light, the effect might not show up over solar or intra galactic distances, but over extragalactic distances could it give the appearance that there is dark matter influencing motion? "
2727,Historic observational data - position of the planets,Is there an online source where historic observational data regarding the position of the planets can be found? I was always intrigued by the fact that Neptune was mathematically predicted before it was actually observed (wiki article).   I am curios in finding more about this mathematical prediction regarding the existence of Neptune. Here are a few questions related to this:   Are there any detailed references on the subject?  Is it possible to find the data which lead to this discovery online somewhere?  Are there online resources regarding the position of the planets (now or at various points in the past)?  
2728,Classification of a Comet,"Google's definition of a comet is:     a celestial object consisting of a nucleus of ice and dust and, when   near the sun, a ‘tail’ of gas and dust particles pointing away from   the sun.   This doesn't cut it for me. Neither does wikipedia's similar entry.  It pertains to the sun, even though comets are present in other parts of the galaxy other than the solar system and probably other galaxies.  Whats more dwarf planet can be classified as follows:   * orbits a host star  * rounded by its own gravity  * not massive enough to induce thermonuclear fusion  * not massive enough to clear its region of debris   Which pretty much fits the bill of a comet.  Do you think the following is a fair / recognised classification of a comet:  Comet: * not rounded by its own gravity * not massive enough to induce thermonuclear fusion * not massive enough to clear its region of debris * composition of ice and dust   But then that's pretty similar to an asteroid:  Asteroid: * not rounded by its own gravity * not massive enough to induce thermonuclear fusion * not massive enough to clear its region of debris   However, this means if an asteroid is comprised of ice and dust, it becomes a comet?  Or are asteroid never comprised of ice and dust? Does my asteroid classification need beefing up, regarding an asteroid's composition?  I'm feeling the comet and the asteroid both need some classification pertaining to their orbit as well? Though thats tricky because only some comets and asteroid, so they're similar in that regard as well! Maybe more details on each objsts composition is needed, like I say... "
2729,How was the astrometry of the famous 1919 solar eclipse confirmation of General Relativity calibrated and verified?,"The new New York Times article The Eclipse That Made Einstein Famous describes several events and discussions on the hundred year anniversary of the the 1919 solar eclipse and verification of the deflection of light by the Sun as predicted by General Relativity. The roles of Albert Einstein, Arthur Eddington, and others are discussed in the article, the play performed at the Royal Astronomical Society in London, in the Nature Physics article A hundred years of the first experimental test of general relativity and the book No Shadow of a Doubt; The 1919 Eclipse That Confirmed Einstein's Theory of Relativity by Daniel Kennefick.  The instruments used for the measurement are shown in the illustration and photograph below.  My question is about the astrometric technique used, and the calibration and verification.   The instruments are long and laying on their sides, viewing the eclipse and the stars near the Sun by reflection in coelostats (mirrors in front of telescopes, moved by clockwork mechanisms).  I can imagine several sources of instrumental and experimental errors due to variations in field distortion and magnification, presumably the measurement was done by comparing the eclipse images with similar images taken by the same instruments of the same field of stars in the same position in the field of view a few months later, at night, in the dark, in order to show that the tiny deflections were not due to variation from one instrument to another.  Is that actually how it was done? Was the experimental set-up left in-place between day and night measurements, or was it packed up and moved?  Was the flatness of the coelostat mirrors independently confirmed somehow?

2731,"How much of the Universe is invisible to us, and how does it affect our theories?","I watched an interview with Neil deGrasse Tyson on The Late Show with Stephen Colbert where he briefly mentioned a disturbing thought. It is something that I have never thought of before, and the idea borders on the eerie.  The idea is this (and here comes a mouthful): If all our knowledge of the Universe is based on observations of distant galaxies (and Milkyway stars), and we accept that the Universe is expanding at such an accelerating rate that at some point in the future only our nearest stars will be visible to whoever inhabits Earth, and that then those future inhabitants will need to explain the Universe based only on what they can observe, then it is possible that we are today trying to explain the Universe based on largely incomplete data.  Like, imagine that there is much more stuff out there, stuff that could help us explain some of the scientific ""mysteries"" such as dark energy/matter, but it is beyond our horizon. We don't know what is missing from our view.  And so I guess the question is this: How does this affect the validity of our current models of the Universe?  "
2732,Why does Gaia use only calcium NIR lines for stellar radial velocity measurements?,"I was reading this overview article about the Gaia spacecraft and I saw the following statement:     These spectra provide radial velocity information that are used to study the kinematic and dynamic evolution of the Milky Way. Radial velocities are derived from three isolated Calcium lines at 849.8, 854.2 and 855.2nm. Other lines in the 847 to 874nm range can provide data on star composition, surface gravity, and metal abundance.   note: as pointed out in the comments below, the third line is at 866.2nm, not 855.2nm - this is suggested to be a typo - the '855' number also shows up on this ESA page.  The high resolution spectroscopy only seems to operate between 847 and 874nm, and ""three isolated Calcium lines"" are used to measure radial velocity.   Do all stars have enough calcium in their atmosphere to produce strong enough features to measure the radial velocity so accurately? I had thought that there are some stellar populations have very little besides hydrogen and helium in their atmosphere.   Are these always emission lines or absorption lines, or will there be some stars with one and some of the other? What fraction of stars simply won't have significant amounts of calcium?    above: Gaia's Radial Velocity Spectrometer from here, credit: ESA.    above: Gaia's Imaging system, including mirrors 4, 5 and 6, prisms, diffraction gratings, and CCD array, from here, credit: EADS Astrium.    above: Gaia's Optical Module, including Ravial Velocity spectrometer (gratings) and afocal field corrector, from here, credit: SAS Astrium.

2733,Basic celestial data,"complete beginner here, only got into star gazing a few days ago using my friend's telescope and I don't really understand at all what any of the measurements mean.  Anyway, talk about jumping in the deep end, but I'm poking around Nasa's Intergalactic Database, but sadly it's all greek to me: [website]Here's a galaxy: NGC 7590  Here's its basic data:  EquJ2000.0 RA  EquJ2000.0 DEC  Velocity km/s  Redshift / z  Magnitude / Qual Filter  Separ arc min  Now I'm afraid I don't really understand what any of these measurements and their values actually mean.  I remember from school what Red Shift is, its the wavelength increasing becoming  'stretched' making the light seem to appear more reddish the faster an object is accelerating away from us. But what is that z unit?  I'm afraid I really don't have a clue regarding anything else... spear arc min, magnitude / qual filter?  Is there a book for a brief understanding of these units? Not out to solve problems regarding celestial mechanics, I just want the NED to make a bit more sense to me so I can visualize these objects. "
2734,The systematic review of past observations in the hope of finding things that may have been missed,"I seem to remember a TV science programme which re-examined the slides that led to the discovery of Pluto and then took a fresh look at earlier slides taken of the space which Pluto was passing through. These slides did indeed feature Pluto but were probably not part of Lowell’s search for the planet. Maybe the old data/images(if still on record) could be revisited with the advantage of later discoveries to reveal things of interest like say orphan planets?  Recently there was this case:-  [website]Which inadvertently did this but are there any programmes/projects retrospectively doing this intentionally?’  So, it is the systematic review of past observations in the hope of finding things that may have been missed or even unknown at the time.

2735,"Where will the planned Deep Space Atomic Clock orbit ""after"" Earth?","I've seen multiple sources repeat the information that the Deep Space Atomic Clock will 'at first' orbit Earth, before moving on out of Earth orbit.     The Deep Space Atomic Clock (DSAC) is a miniaturized, ultra-precise   mercury-ion atomic clock for precise radio navigation in deep space.   It is orders of magnitude more stable than existing navigation clocks,   and has been refined to limit drift of no more than 1 nanosecond in 10   days.   Wikipedia: ""Its development will include a test flight in low-Earth orbit""  JPL: ""the instrument will be tested in Earth orbit for one year, with the goal of being ready for future missions to other worlds""  What would it then orbit? The Sun? Or some L point? Other planets? Or will multiple ones orbit all of the above?  Edit: for those wanting to close based on ""not astronomy"", have you considered astronomy does not have to be done from earth and indeed much of the data astronomers use often comes from probes and satellites in space.  Therefore 'how/where will this space beacon be used?' has strong impact on future of astronomy. "
2736,What is the composition of the Solar Wind?,"Is the composition of the Solar Wind known? I'm especially interested in the heavy metals present. Most accounts deny the existence of anything other than electrons, protons, and some alpha particles; but it seems to me that if we can identify most of the known elements in the Sun's photosphere, then they are likely to exist in the Solar Wind at some concentration. If not, what is the detection limit (ppm? ppb? ppt?) we have so far established? Have any limits been established for atom clusters (dust?)? As a secondary question, I guess that (neutral) hydrogen and (negative hydride) H(-) do not exist in the solar wind due to its temperature being too high. Is this correct, and if so, is it true throughout the heliosphere or does the solar wind cool enough for the formation of bound species? "

Unfortunately, my math is not great; I can usually implement something that's written down, but I don't have the wherewithal to work it out myself.  For the Jovian moons, the data is listed at: [website] Sat.           a       e          w           M        i            node      n             P       Pw      Pnode    R.A.        Dec.

Whilst the first 6 parameters appear to be the same (a, e, w, M, i, node), the Keplerian elements also have ""rates"", or time derivatives (according to this post: [website]If I could understand how to determine the ""rates"" for the Jovian moons, then I might be able to use the same formula (is this the right thing to do?)  It looks to me like those rates are something I should be able to compute from the other data provided for the moons, however I haven't been able to determine how.  My suspicion is that I either need a different formula for the computation using the Laplace Planes, or I need to compute those 'rate' values and use the same formula I already have.  I'm trying to generate cartesian (x, y, z) coordinates for each Moon where (0,0,0) is the centre of Jupiter itself, for a given date/time (typically ""now"").  I'm beginning to wonder if I'm barking up the wrong tree on this.  Can anyone shed any light "
2739,What is frequency range?,"Using the NED, you can search via frequency range corresponding to the selected pass band filter. I'm a beginner here and don't really understand. Here's the quote:     NOTES: Objects with observations in the frequency range corresponding to the selected passband filter will be returned. For   example, selection of Spitzer MIPS 24 µm will also return objects with   photometry from IRAS 25 µm because these filters overlap. This feature   permits the location of objects with photometry in the selected region   of the spectrum, while cutting across multiple surveys, detectors and   filters that have been cross-correlated by NED. A future upgrade will   include an option to restrict the search to only the selected passband   filter.   There are then a list of 'passbands', all the way up to gamma. What is this actually mean? The amount of radiation given off by a celestial body?  I'm looking at the categories I'm more familiar with:  Helio. Radial Velocity Redshift Major Diameter (arcmin) Minor Diameter (arcmin) Magnitude and Filter Classifications    And I'm not sure where this radiation fits in. Is it  Spectral Energy Distribution (SED)    ? Could someone explain the following terms to me if this is the case:   Observed Passband Uncertainty Units     Freq (Hz)     Mode Aperture/Qualifiers Reference Code   No.   Wnad what about published and homogenised variables?

2742,"""Who saw"" the binary neutron star merger first? What was the sequence of events? (GRB/GW170817)","I'm trying to read Multi-messenger Observations of a Binary Neutron Star Merger the ""cast of thousands"" OPEN Access ApJ letter 848:L12 (59pp), 2017 October 20 [website]There seems to be five instruments involved in the first detection and direction determination; LIGO-Hanford and LIGO-Livingston, VIRGO, Fermi-GBM, and INTEGRAL. The first three are gravitational wave detectors and the last two are gamma-ray telescopes in Earth orbit. Figure 2 of the paper (part of which is shown below) provides a densely packed infographic of the early observations. In the top left one can see an inset that spans from twelve seconds before the merger during the gravitational wave (GW) ramp in frequency, to six seconds after, where the majority of the gamma ray burst (GRB) is detected.  Somehow the combination of the GW and GRB set in motion a sequence of events that triggered a world-wide observation campaign to look for the event in all the remaining electromagnetic spectrum from radio through visible and UV to X-rays. Neutrino data streams were checked as well.  Question: I'd like to ask about the sequence of events, the alerts, and the rapid automatic and manual analysis of the GW and GRB data which triggered the alerts. Which detector or combination first ""saw"" the event as some kind of flagged event? Did one trigger a rapid analysis of the other? Were these automated alerts triggering software to re-analyze, or SMS text messages to thousands of cell phones triggering everyone to sit down at their work stations?    below: Figure 2 (partial) showing the timeline seconds before and hours and days after (logarithmic scale).

2743,Which approximations are required for the synodic period formula?,"The formula below is used to calculate the synodic period between two bodies orbiting a same third one:   [tex]  This formula can be used, for instance, to deduce the period of a planet in the Solar System, given that [tex] can be measured (period between two consecutive observations of a planet in the same relative position in the sky) and taking [tex] as 365.26 days.  I have read that this formula is derived from:  [tex]  My question is: which approximations are required for this result to hold true? Must the orbits be circular? Must these two bodies be in the same plane around the third? Also, considering the case of elliptical orbits but still assuming that the mass of the third body [tex] and [tex], would the synodic period of body 2 as observed from body 1 be indeed constant? "

2746,"If a solar system were surrounded by a cloud of debris, is it possible for a planet's orbit to intersect it?","I'm doing research for a story that I'm writing and I'd like some physics advice on whether a hypothetical system of celestial bodies is possible.  Suppose the following:   A system of planets orbiting a star, similar in size to our own. A cloud of debris (Asteroids, technological refuse, and dust) surrounds the entire system, similar to the description of a Dyson swarm. The outermost planet orbiting on a path that intersects the cloud during a small portion of it's year, but is within the cloud for the majority of it's year.   Is this configuration possible within our understanding of physics, or would gravity cause the objects of the cloud and the outermost planet to 'snap' to an orbit that does not intersect? Would the planet 'capture' objects within the swarm in it's own orbit?  My story takes place on the inside of a Dyson swarm or bubble, where interplanetary travel has developed to a reasonable degree, but cannot escape the swarm. An area of intrigue might be the outermost planet. If it can be landed upon while it's orbit is within the swarm, people could 'ride' the planet through to the other side if they stayed there for a number of years or went into stasis there.  Any thoughts or opinions are greatly appreciated. "

2748,Do mixed type remnant collisions produce anything interesting?,"The recent detection of a binary neutron star inspiraling and colliding raises an interesting question in my mind. Type Ia supernovae are believed to be caused by white dwarf/regular star pairs and/or white dwarf pairs. Short gamma ray bursts are now known to be produced by neutron star/neutron star collisions. Black hole/black hole collisions haven't produced any verifiably detected electromagnetic radiation. What about some of the other mixed type collissions? Especially white dwarf/neutron star or neutron star/black hole?  My understanding is that stellar binaries tend to have similar mass, so mixed type remnants will likely be rather rare. Hence, why I didn't ask about white dwarf/black hole binaries. Even so, I'm curious how the large difference in density would affect things. Especially if a neutron star would be tidally shredded into an accretion disk by a black hole before they can collide, making a relatively slow event, or will the process be more rapid and violent, akin to the events we've seen so far? "
2749,What is the closest one could get to a black hole and still stand a _realistic_ chance of escape?,"This question is inspired by the one asked here:  Is there any stable orbit around a black hole?  and I note that (though I've heard of these before) there are, apparently, 3 important fundamental ""zones of inescapability"" with regard to a black hole that can be identified on the basis of physical principles and which can be defined by the Schwarzschild [tex] coordinate and its critical radius [tex]: one of these is, of course, the event horizon, at [tex], from which no escape at all is possible. The second one is the ""photon sphere"", here referred to as the zone at the ""innermost bound circular orbit"", at [tex], at which a photon (particle of light) traveling at right angles (i.e. constant [tex]-coordinate) can complete one circuit around the hole and within which only impossibly powerful rockets could get you out. Orbits above this point but below the ""innermost stable circular orbit"", out to [tex], are possible but require a continuous application of (likely ungodly large) engine propulsion. Above this, more-or-less normal orbits are possible, though they precess more and more rapidly as the general-relativistic effect that is incipient with the orbits of the planets becomes fully mature in these environs.  Now, the trick, of course, is the qualifiers regarding propulsion: ""impossibly powerful"", ""ungodly large"" which basically are likely words for ""it can't be done with realistic technology"". Which, then, of course, is what begs this question - what can be done with such?  For my ""realistic"" scenario, a generous interpretation will be used which is ""a matter-antimatter fueled spacecraft with a wet mass 100x its dry mass"". The goal is for the craft to execute one of two manoeuvres:   lower itself into an orbit around the hole, orbit a few times, and then take off again (so it must have fuel for both trips) and return to where it launched from, and establish a ""slingshot"" trajectory around the hole that takes it as close as possible before shooting it back out into space (this may be easier?).   I consider this ""reasonable"" because any travel to a black hole will already be an extreme problem in interstellar travel, much less the kinds of targets that will already be in use for this kind of proposal which will almost surely have to be supermassive black holes to be interesting and thus requiring travel at least to the center of the Galaxy (~200 000 Pm) if not intergalactically (distances of many Zm), with tera- or petaseconds of travel time (thousands to millions of years) at least, or something like wormholes if they are possible. Hence I presume the technology to make such a craft will be readily available to any civilization that is capable of pulling this feat off to begin with.  The reason we need supermassive black holes is tidal forces and ideally we want to get as close to the horizon as possible. Possible targets may be Sagittarius A* and M87* (the black hole that the picture was taken of), both supermassive black holes, the latter much more so still, at the centers of galaxies. However, M87* presents the additional challenge of an extremely active matter environment around it, which may foreclose that possibility even further, though even Sgr A* might be too much. Hence, failing that, we can just consider a hypothetical black hole of mass equal to either, that is suitably ""quiet"", if nothing else is possible. (or perhaps imagine that with M87*, it has entered a quiescent period by the time the ships arrive as compared to the time when it sent the images we saw)  What would be the closest approach possible, in both scenarios, while still having enough fuel to get away (or not being destroyed by other effects)? We should also assume that the craft starts out at great distance where gravity is hopefully unremarkable, but do not budget for more than 250 Ms shipboard total mission time (a bit less than 2893 days of 86.4 ks each), measured from time of release from mission departure station to time of return.

2752,Water vapour in space,"This question is inspired by, but different from, What happens if an ice cube is left in space?  Mark's accepted answer says ""…if you stick your ice cube out in the Oort Cloud, it'll grow: the mean surface temperature is 40K or below,…"".  To which the obvious response is Everything has a vapour pressure, so everything in the vacuum of space will evaporate eventually. Accordingly I thought it might be worth investigating why ice grains do exist. For which we need some numbers.  Vapour pressure of water at 40K  Most charts do not go that low. The best figure I have come up with was by looking at the pictures in Water Ice Films in Cryogenic Vacuum Chambers, a doctoral thesis by Jesse Michael Labello. Figure 4 on page 4 has graphs which, extrapolated by guesswork, suggest that the vapour pressure of water at 40K is less than [tex] torr.  Atmospheric pressure in space  The Moon's atmospheric pressure is said to be [tex] torr, and the New World Encyclopedia says interstellar space is [tex] torr, and some answers on Physics Stack Exchange suggest about [tex] for intergalactic space.    It appears, therefore, that ice grains at 40K do not evaporate because their vapour pressure is not high enough. Does it follow, therefore:   That ice grains would evaporate, even at 40K, if they were in a vacuum? That, if the ice is at equilibrium with its vapour, the relative humidity of interstellar space is 100%? Or is the process of evaporation/condensation kinetically so slow that the universe is too young for it to have reached equilibrium?  "
2753,Does a kilonova leave a high mass remnant?,"My understanding of Type Ia supernovae is that they are expected, in most cases, to destroy the white dwarf(s) that went in to them, leaving behind no high density remnants (i.e. no white dwarf, neutron star, or black hole). Black hole/black hole collisions are expected to leave behind a black hole, of course, with less mass than the sum of the masses of the black holes that went in to the collision. Do we expect a kilonova to leave behind nothing but gas and radiation or some kind of stellar remnant? If it leaves behind a remnant, what class to we expect it to be (white dwarf, neutron star, or black hole) and what mass? The addition of mass seems redundant, but the dividing lines between the masses of these objects are based on upper limits on the mass of the less dense class (Chandrasekhar limit for white dwarfs, Tolman–Oppenheimer–Volkoff limit for neutron stars), and don't actually apply as lower limits for the mass of the high density class. For example, neutron stars are sometimes referred to as giant nuclei, which would put the lower limit of their mass at [tex] or [tex] atomic mass units, depending on whether the presence of a neutron and stability to radioactive decay are requirements. Yes, those times people are being poetic due to the difference in stabilization mechanisms (gravity vs nuclear forces), but the point remains that it may be possible for a neutron star to be theoretically stable at less than [tex]. The only lower limit to black hole mass I know of would be the lifetime limit from black hole evaporation.  Put another way, do we think the density at any point in either of the inspiraling neutron stars gets high enough to form an event horizon? If that happens, this seems like a plausible way for producing black holes that are smaller than those produce by core collapse supernovae, kind of like how critical mass for atom bombs can be achieved by either bringing together enough fissile material or compressing the available material enough (e.g. the fat man detonation mechanism vs the little boy one).

2757,How would a small TCO (temporarily captured orbiter) or other natural Earth satellite most likely be detected?,"A sentence from the abstract of The population of natural Earth satellites states:     At any given time there should be at least one NES of 1-meter diameter orbiting the Earth. The average temporarily-captured orbiter (TCO; an object that makes at least one revolution around the Earth in a co-rotating coordinate system) completes (2.88 ± 0.82) rev around the Earth during a capture event that lasts (286± 18) d.   As far as I know, the only known, well documented temporarily captured Earth satellite is 2006 RH120, which was in within 1 million km of the Earth for about 1 year. It has an estimated size of 2 to 3 meters, a rotation period (about it's axis) of about 3 minutes (presumably determined by photometry). According to Wikipedia:     2006 RH120 was discovered on 14 September 2006 by the 27-inch (690 mm) Schmidt camera of the Catalina Sky Survey in Arizona.   Using data from the JPL Horizons database, it seems 2006 RH120 was only about 850,000 km from Earth at the time it was discovered.  Deep sky surveys are extremely prolific at detecting small solar system bodies. There was also a recent answer addressing the possibility that the Gaia spacecraft's could detect trojan asteroids associated with Earth's orbit, linking to the paper Detection of inner Solar System Trojan Asteroids by Gaia.   The question asked specifically about TCO's being detected by Gaia, but my question is more general: How would a small TCO (temporarily captured orbiter) or other natural Earth satellite most likely be detected?  There are Earth-based sky surveys, space based visible and near-visible, and possibly even infrared/thermal detections possible, even Earth-based radar, and possibly others.  Are there any searches specifically targeting TCOs?    above: a simple plot of the orbit of 2006 RH120 from JPL Horizions transformed to an Earth-centered Earth-Sun-synodic frame - red line with dots every 10 days, for the period when it was within a +/- 1.6 million km cube centered on Earth in this frame. The green thick band around Earth is the moons orbit during this 448 day period. "
2758,How is the expansion rate of the universe obtained from Baryon Acoustic Oscillations?,"I understand that we can measure the sound horizon from the anisotropies in the CMB. Large galaxy surveys today can construct two-point correlation functions, which reveal peaks at distances equal to today's sound horizon, I think because the BAOs at decoupling essentially created dark matter gravitational wells for structure to begin forming in (correct me if I'm wrong). I'm under the impression that the sound horizon is a fixed physical distance, so its measured comoving distance at any redshift should always be the same. Am I right or wrong in this assumption?  I read some information from a few different sources on this topic which confused me. On Wikipedia: ""Peaks have been found in the correlation function (the probability that two galaxies will be a certain distance apart) at 100 h−1 Mpc, indicating that this is the size of the sound horizon today, and by comparing this to the sound horizon at the time of decoupling (using the CMB), we can confirm the accelerated expansion of the universe.""  But if the sound horizon is always at the same physical scale, how can we use measurements today to determine the rate of expansion? Do the correlation functions give you proper separations, and from that with different cosmological models we can determine what [tex] or [tex] value gives a comoving separation equal to the sound horizon? And is this the same as the BAO signal? "

2760,Would an extremely bright star produce same kind of shadow band effect as seen in solar eclipses just before totality?,"This answer explains that the shimmering patterns seen on surfaces at the moment before totality of a solar eclipse are called shadow bands, and that the phenomenon is closely related to the twinkling appearance of stars (but not angularly larger planets) through the Earth's atmosphere.  If for some reason there happened to be a bright star close enough to Earth that its nighttime illumination visible on surfaces, but small enough in angular width that it twinkled, would we see shadow bands at night, every night when the star was out?  As there's a good chance the answer is ""yes"" to the hypothetical, I'd like to ask if this situation is in fact possible, or if a star were close enough to be bright enough to visibly illuminate a white surface at night, would it then be large enough in angular extent that it wouldn't twinkle any more?

2762,Why can't this be the simple (and obvious) explanation for the dimming of KIC 8462852?,"Couldn't it be just a relatively large object, anywhere in the interstellar space between the star and Earth? I mean, look out the window at a far away car or a tree, then stretch out your hand and you can block it entirely with your thumb. What if the 'thumb' is that object (a planet, a star, a comet, some space debri, etc.) that's between Earth and the star, and it's just the right size to only block that star, and no other stars. Why has this very simple explanation been ruled out (if it has been)?  I know that the debri next to the star explanation has been ruled out because of the lack of IR that would come from that debri being heated up if it was close to the star. But this is not a problem here, if the blocking object is far away from the star. "

They both link to the new (and paywalled) paper in Science A radio ridge connecting two galaxy clusters in a filament of the cosmic web.  What I've gathered so far is that seen between two known and characterized clusters of galaxies, there is a region with some excess continuum radio power at 140 MHz and some excess continuum X-ray power.  Neither of these are spectral features so their distances can't be associated with the galactic clusters by doppler shift.   Question: How do they know that the X-ray and Radio continuum are both really coming from the space between these two clusters of galaxies, and not in front of or behind it?

2766,Mars and 115 mm - which eyepieces?,"Today I could roughly see Saturn with ring structure for the first time with my Seben 114-1000 telescope.  Then later I was dealing with Mars and found out that I must do something wrong, as with no eyepiece I could really see this planet closer.  So, whether I take 20, 12.5, or 6 mm eyepieces, the size as I set sharp focus remains a small light orange circle of solid uniform colour.  The app sky view shows for today 64% clear view, maybe an explanation why I can't see more details.  But is this possible to see Mars filling in the view field? And why there is no recognizable difference between 20 and 6 mm - do I need them in combination with something else?  Here it says, even the polar caps of Mars should be recognizable with this telescope model scale.  UPD  So far, it looks like that with up to 6 mm I can zoom in fairly well to such details as:   large moon craters Jupiter (seen as small white illuminated blob) with the Galilean moons (seen as  stars) Solid white-coloured Saturn with its ring and some space between planet and ring visible   Mars keeps being small to medium yellow-orange disk of solid color.  Using 4 mm gives little bit more zoom but less detail.  However, I can see with 6 mm that Moon contours are slightly jittering, maybe through light refraction in the night air (all observation done from the ground on a field). The temperature in the night has been 21°C. "
2767,How massive does a main sequence star need to be to go type 1 supernova?,"We know the mass a white dwarf needs to be. That's well defined by the Chandrasekhar limit, but before a main sequence star turns into a white dwarf it tends to lose a fair bit of its matter in a stellar nebula.     According to this site, the white dwarf that remains is about half the mass of the main sequence star, with larger stars losing a bit more.  So, the question: Is it correct to say that a star with a mass of about three solar masses will eventually go supernova, similar to a type 1 supernova, even when it's not part of a binary system? Has that kind of supernova ever been observed?  Or does something else happen like in the final stages of that star? Does it keeps going though collapse and expand cycles, losing enough mass that when it finally becomes a white dwarf it's below the Chandrasekhar limit in mass?  Mostly, what I've read on supernovae says that type 1 supernovae happen when a white dwarf accretes extra matter and reaches the limit and type 2 supernovae are much larger and require about 8-11 solar masses to generate the iron core which triggers the supernova. What happens with the death of the star between three solar masses and eight solar masses? "
2768,Neutron stars and distribution of heavy elements,"In the news, of course, is the theory that much of the mass of the heaviest elements in Earth would have come from colliding neutron stars.  This graphic gives one such analysis:   Origin of the Elements in the Solar System by Jennifer Johnson is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International License. (Larger version at [website]I don't know how accurate this is, but the URL looks good.  Also, this seems to be a new theory, and AFAIK this is the first actual evidence for it.  If this is correct, what are the implications for the quantity of heavy elements that would be found on planets outside our solar system?  In particular, I guess, the very heavy ones: gold, platinum, thorium, uranium...  We've been watching the skies for signs of neutron star collisions for several years now (IIUC), and I guess we're starting to get an idea of the frequency of this event.  And I've seen estimates of how much gold etc. was produced by this particular event.  How many planets would one such collision supply with the quantity of heavy elements in Earth? (I guess we only really know about gold in the Earth's crust, and to some extent in the mantle; are these elements concentrated in the core?  Any idea about heavy elements in other planets of our solar system?)    So: given the frequency of the event per galaxy, the estimated number of stars with planets in a galaxy, etc., is it likely that most planets are deficient in heavy elements, as compared with Earth?  (Side comment: if so, then nuclear wars might be rare or impossible on those planets.) "
2769,How massive does a planet need to be to create gravitational lensing?,"Is it ever possible for starlight to be distorted in a noticeable way from something as small as a planet?   I'm guessing that the chances of this working are better on a dense terrestrial planet than a gas giant.  How do you calculate this?  Edit: I was unclear, sorry. I'm specifically thinking about lensing that would distort the shape of a star, not just move its position. "
2770,Calculating the distance of objects using the Gaia DR1,"The Gaia DR1 was released middle of September with ~1.1 billion objects. The schema contains right ascension, declination and parallax, which could be used to calculate Cartesian co-ordinates (xyz).  The overwhelming majority (>99.998%) of objects do not contain an entry for parallax. I suspect this needs to be computed using other columns (e.g. phot_g_mean_mag?).  How do you compute the parallax for an object when its not included?  The data model is documented here . "
2771,"""Lunar tropics""","The tropics is region of the Earth in which the Sun could be directly overhead.  What is the corresponding region for the Moon?  Is it the same or slightly larger?    I live in the UK and hence have to travel quite far to see the Sun directly overhead.  If I am content to see the Moon directly overhead, would my trip be much shorter?    My experience suggests so.  Once long ago, I travelled to India without flying.  I ""saw"" the Moon directly overhead while in Iran and hence not yet in the Tropics.  However, I had no way to accurately measure this and I may have mistaken the usually high (for me) Moon for being exactly overhead. "
2772,Are there any known planets whose axis is oriented such that one pole always faces its star?,"Earth rotates around the sun and around its axis (A North, South axis) giving us days, nights and seasons.  Are there any known planets that rotate with an axis pointing toward its sun so that one half of the planet is always facing it (the other half is always facing away from it)? Like Uranus, but not switching which side is facing the sun every 6 months.  (Would this even be theoretically possible?) "
2773,Size of Saturn's ring material,How big are the chunks of rock ice that make up Saturn's rings? Are there many objects larger than pebble size? 
2774,Would an ultra bright moon indicate that the world is ending?,"There is a sci-fi television episode that shows a man looking out the window into the night sky. There up in the sky is the moon, and it's extraordinarily bright.  The man spends the rest of the night trying to do all the things he wish he had done in his life. A race to experience life before the morning sunrise.  His conclusion; A giant solar flare has erupted, and the side of the Earth facing the sun has been burned away. The world is ending....  How plausible is this story?  Could a solar flare burn the Earth? and if you happen to be on the dark side when it happens. Would the moon be a reliable indicator? "
2775,Measurement precision of celestial events,"The local weatherman declared that fall starts at exactly 10:21am (local time). Ignoring the fact that seasonal boundaries have multiple definitions (meteorological, astronomical, etc.), what he perhaps means to have said is that the fall equinox occurs at that moment.  Presumably, that is the moment at which Earth's axis of rotation is exactly perpendicular to the Sun-Earth line.  My question is: to what degree of precision can this be measured? The weatherman's statement was to the minute. But is it actually measured to a finer precision? If so, plus or minus how many seconds?   What about the the solstices? Can they be measured to the same degree of accuracy? Are there factors which uniquely affect the accuracy of either measurement? "
2776,Sunspot heliograph to generate random numbers for bitcoins?,"If this is off topic, please change it to world-building.  Is it possible to make a low cost heliography telescope, which is not digital, and which can be used to generate an worldwide numerical fingerprint using sun spot positions as a mathematical code?  Every city in the world would have the same heliograph. Nearly all the sunlit heliographs of the world would agree what the sunspot fingerprint code is. The sun generated code would then decide who's turn it is to record financial verification tasks, government accounts, and other corruption issues.   Would other cosmic signals be more practical to graph and suited to that end?  Does the sun change too slowly to be useful for generate a daily random code? what about weekly?  Do you have any tips of how to design a simple analogue heliograph that converts sunspots into random numerical code, (i.e. to make a crypto currency called Sun-Peso/ to decide an olympic host country)?

2777,Could an asteroid knock the moon out of its orbit?,"As describe in this CNN article, an asteroid is going to pass near the Earth on Halloween.  The article says that      As it misses Earth by about 300,000 miles (slightly farther away than the moon), the asteroid, named 2015 TB145, will be visible to those with good telescopes   and that     It's a good thing it will miss, though. The asteroid is estimated to be 300 to 600 meters wide and traveling at 78,000 mph.   If, hypothetically, this asteroid actually hit the moon, could it knock it out of orbit? How about another, contrived asteroid with whatever properties are needed?  To be clear, when I say ""out of its orbit"" I'm including both the orbit decaying and the moon crashing into Earth, and the moon being knocked out into space away from the Earth's influence. Either would do. "
2778,What is in the brightest area of the night sky?,"When I look up in the night sky, I assume the brightest area, commonly known as ""The Milky Way"", is the Galactic Center of our home galaxy.     But then I stumbled upon this illustration, which seems to suggest what I'm seeing is (and by far) not the Galactic Center. In fact, from this picture it looks like the brightest area might be the closest spiral arm (on the opposite direction of the galactic center).    I know this illustration is not meant to be precise, so it's probably not the closest spiral arm either.   So, what am I really looking at when I stare at the brightest spot of the night sky? What percentage of it would be stars, planets, and nebulae? And what's the farthest object I can see in that direction with my unaided eyes? "
2779,Currently proposed ways to distinguish between a really big planet and a really small star,"The Next Big Future article Rogue Exoplanet 12.7 times bigger than Jupiter is 20 light years away     Astronomers using the National Science Foundation’s Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) have made the first radio-telescope detection of a planetary-mass object beyond our Solar System. They found a rogue planet 12.7 times the mass of Jupiter twenty light years from earth.      It is at the boundary of Jovian objects and Brown dwarf stars.      [...]      Last year, an independent team of scientists discovered that SIMP J01365663+0933473 was part of a very young group of stars. Its young age meant that it was in fact so much less massive that it could be a free-floating planet — only 12.7 times more massive than Jupiter, with a radius 1.22 times that of Jupiter. At 200 million years old and 20 light-years from Earth, the object has a surface temperature of about 825 degrees Celsius, or more than 1500 degrees Fahrenheit. By comparison, the Sun’s surface temperature is about 5,500 degrees Celsius.      The difference between a gas giant planet and a brown dwarf remains hotly debated among astronomers, but one rule of thumb that astronomers use is the mass below which deuterium fusion ceases, known as the “deuterium-burning limit”, around 13 Jupiter masses.   In the spirit of   Do astronomers generally agree that the distinction between comets and astroids is not so clear? Is this object an asteroid or comet, and how can it produce so many tails?   and the relatively recent reclassification of Pluto as a dwarf planet and not a planet proper, I'd like to ask what are the ways that have are currently proposed and given consideration to distinguish between a really big planet and a really small star?  Is the ""rule of thumb"" proposed in the block quote the leading contender or are there other definitions that receive a similar amount of support "
2780,Solar visible light spectrum,"So the visible light from stars can be used to identify the elements in that star by looking at the spectral emission lines and comparing those lines to emission lines of various elements (and their isotopes) here on earth.  These well-known line wavelengths can also be used to determine the relative motion of that star to the earth by looking at the red (or blue) shift of wavelengths of those spectral lines.  It would then be reasonable to assume that our own sun emits those same well-defined spectral lines, which should show up at specific wavelengths (based on the elements in the sun).    However, sunlight appears (mostly) white, and using a prism shows a rather consistent rainbow of color across the visible spectrum, rather than what one would expect to see (based on analysis of emission spectrum from other stars) of spikes at specific wavelengths.  So, what is causing the full-spectrum light from the sun to appear at the surface of the earth if what I'm assuming is specific spectral lines being generated from fusion on the sun itself?     I'm sure I'm missing something in my understanding, but I'm not sure what it is.  I understand (from this question: How deep is the &quot;A&quot; Fraunhofer line in the solar spectrum? Is it from the Sun&#39;s or Earth&#39;s atmosphere?) that the earth's atmosphere absorbs specific wavelengths of light, but why would the sun's light be consistent across its visible spectrum if the typical star light is generated at specific spectrum wavelengths? "
2781,clarification of the Kozai mechanism,"As Wikipedia says,      In celestial mechanics, the Kozai mechanism, or the Lidov–Kozai mechanism, is a perturbation of the orbit of a satellite by the gravity of another body orbiting farther out, causing libration (oscillation about a constant value) of the orbit's argument of pericenter. As the orbit librates, there is a periodic exchange between its inclination and its eccentricity.   My questions are:  Question A Which is the least massive object? The tertiary object, which is the furthest object, or the satellite in the inner binary? It seems it is not necessary that the tertiary object be the least massive one, which violates what Wikipedia says.  Question B How does the three-body system evolve?     There is a periodic exchange between its inclination and its eccentricity.   Whose inclination and whose eccentricity? Please specify them using m0, m1 or m2 in the figure below.  The orbit of the inner binary should become and more circular. Can it become circular, eccentric, circular, eccentric?  Question C The inner binary will lose energy during the whole process, right?   "
2782,"Is the three-body system ""unique""?","Given a state of an ideal 3 body system (i.e., without external interference) in time [tex]: the velocity [tex], mass [tex] and position [tex] for [tex], using numerical method it is possible to determine any state in time [tex], where [tex]. But is it possible to determine a unique state in time [tex] where [tex]?   In another word, is it sufficient to know a single state of the system for any given time to deduce the states of the system for all time?  Equivalently, will two different states of the 3-body system results in the same state (maybe at different time) in the future? "
2783,Are brown dwarf masses notoriously difficult to measure?,"The Next Big Future article Rogue Exoplanet 12.7 times bigger than Jupiter is 20 light years away     SIMP J01365663+0933473 has a magnetic field more than 200 times stronger than Jupiter’s. The object was originally detected in 2016 as one of five brown dwarfs the scientists studied with the VLA to gain new knowledge about magnetic fields and the mechanisms by which some of the coolest such objects can produce strong radio emission. Brown dwarf masses are notoriously difficult to measure, and at the time, the object was thought to be an old and much more massive brown dwarf.   Is this true? Are brown dwarf masses notoriously difficult to measure? Naively, it seems to me if I had brightness at a few wavelengths I could deduce a temperature, and if I had a distance, at least for a blackbody I'd know the area as well.  Are one or both of these in fact difficult to get, or is there something else I'm missing?  "
2784,What is this graph showing?,"  This is from the NED  What do these three titles mean?   log fb (Jy) MRK 1014 Log v (HZ)   Why is there LINE,LINE,LINE,LINE,LINE written along the bottom? What does that signify?  What are the dots and lines showing? A range of information? In that chase, what's the relevance of the dot?   Is it like this: The dot is the log v and then the horizontal line shows the range of MRK 1014 recorded for that log v and the vertical line showing the log fv recorded for it?  Why does the log v between 12 - 16.3 have small amounts of log fv and MRK 1014, but the log v between 15 - 19 have no log fv at all, but a large amount of MRK 1014. The same goes for the 2 log v points between 10.4 - 12, except these two have a large amount of log fv but no MRK 1014  Maybe if you could explain the units to me and give me links to further reading it would all become a lot clearer...  Update Okay MRK 1014 is the same of the object. (Doh!) However, what is that titless axis showing? "
2785,What will happen if a black hole appears near our solar system?,"We know that black hole possesses immense power and can destroy anything coming in front of it's path. If such a black hole appears near our solar system, are we going to survive? Is there any way not to fall in a black hole?  "
2786,What is left of a universe where no matter and energy exist and is there a term for this?,"In the final energy state of the universe, there exists a hypothesis that all matter will have fallen into black holes and neutron stars. If, through Hawking radiation, after all matter is consumed and black holes eventually do dissipate, what is left of our Universe?  I may be describing Heat Death, but I'm not 100% sure. However, due to the Law of Conservation of Energy, I suspect that energy will be all that is left, only in equilibrium meaning no ability for energy to form matter.   In the event I'm wrong and there exists no matter and no energy, would the term Universe still be applicable here? "
2787,Which stars have been named after astronomers?,"Most apparent stars have ancient names. But some of the newer (since 200 or so years) discoveries have been given the name of some prominent astronomer. Kapteyn's star is one example, and there are several more in that Wikipedia article. Edward Barnard et cetera. But there aren't too many, are there? It seems hard to get ones name attached to a star, or am I missing a bunch?    Kapteyn and his tie knot matching star    Astronomy was never easy, there's always more to see. Star namer van Biesbroeck in action with his flaring tiny red dwarf. "
2788,What makes the Earth infinitely rotating around its axis,"I was reading two sites before I posted the question here. One site says something like that the collisions in Universe eventually set the planets rotating, another site says that our planet is formed from some collapsing Nebula or whatsoever and Nebula was rotating when it was about to die and that set the Earth rotating at first place.  The question should be probably better specified. Is Earth rotating because of some continuous force, or because at first place there was some one-time force which set it rotating and the effect lasts until now?  As for the first case, which force is it? As for the second case, that should break our physical laws, because there would be one force, applied a very long time ago which is still in effect and not about to slow down and with a very very long lasting effect. Because thousands or millions of years for rotation is a very long time, isn't it. Or is it slowing down?   BTW: the infinite movement around orbit is bit mysterious too, because you can say that's because of gravity, but gravity itself attracts the things only to one direction, but orbit movement is like parallel with the gravity emitter, and again it is perpetual. "
2789,Identifying cataclysmic stellar phenomena,"Cataclysms such as novas, kilonovas, supernova, magnetars, quasars, gamma ray bursts are rarely visible from Earth.   Under what conditions (such as distance, day vs. night, naked eye vs. level of optics) would such phenomena be visible from the Earth's surface, and what would they look like in terms of shape, initial duration, brightness, and so forth?  For instance, I have seen questions like how long does a supernova last and I have read that they can be visible for some time afterwards as a nebula forms, but this doesn't tell me what the initial burst would look like.  For instance, would it be possible to see a supernova in a neighboring galaxy such as Andromeda?  If so, how long would it be visible with the naked eye?  Would it look like a flash, last a few seconds, several?  I assume with a supernova not in our own galaxy there would be no subsequent light from the expanding shell since it would be too far away, whereas in our own galaxy if it were close enough we would subsequently see it, but in that case would there be a short burst of light, following by darkness and then the re-emergence of light, or would it be a continuously visible phenomena? "
2790,Field excitement in quantum field theory?,How at the beginning of this universe the fields as proposed in quantum fields theory get excited?? How exactly these fields originated? 
2791,Perception of an objects history passing as an observer moves toward it,"If a star is 20 light-years away and I look at it through a telescope, what I'm observing is what the star was doing 20 years ago yes? So, if I fix my sight on the star and move toward it (for example's sake, let's say 0.5C or half the speed of light in a vacuum) in a linear path (which is not practical for real space travel) it would take me 40 years to reach it. By the time I reach it I would be observing in (almost) real-time what is happening. So to me that says that I've watched 60 years of the star's history in 40 years worth of time. So then, would it look to me as if I was watching a movie of the star's history in 1.5 times 'normal' speed? (60/40 = 3/2 or 1 1/2)  "
2792,A universal reference point,"I would like to use a system of co-ordinates (x,y,z,t) based on a specific well known point. My original choice (the center of the universe in the big bang theory, Bigbang0), was wrong as the universe did not explode everything moved apart from everything else and is still doing so.  So I would like a reference position useful to an observer within at least 100,000 light years, and valid for 250,000 years. I will call it Bigref0 to remind me of my error.    From Bigref0 I would have a position - x y z.  The time value I would like to use as an origin is based on the following criteria.   The centers of the Sun and Earth are most closely aligned to the Bigref0.   The time point t0 should be the closest point within 256 tera (2 to the power 48) seconds or about 8 million years which provides a reasonable accuracy. I doubt we can do better than 1 part in 25,000 or +/- 2 to the power 15.    The questions are    When was/will be t0 ?  What is the distance (r0) to Bigref0 from the center of the Sun at time t0?  The x y z position of the Earth relative to the center of the Sun at time t0 ? The accuracy/stability of the 5 values (t0,r0,x,y,z) ?        "
2793,What is the temperature on surface of Pluto facing Sun?,"According to wiki page, the mean temperature of Pluto is 44 degree K (-229 degree C). However, given that Pluto is tilted greatly and there is daylight for long periods on part of Pluto facing the Sun and also given that atmosphere of Pluto scatters light to a high degree, the surface temperature on that part of Pluto may be higher. The atmosphere of Pluto contains methane which is a powerful greenhouse gas, and that also could push up the temperature.   What can be the maximum temperature on part of Pluto facing the Sun? Does available temperature estimate take into account findings of New Horizons probe which flyby Pluto earlier this year? Thanks for your insight. "
2794,Does more ocean on an Earth analog produce a different rotation period?,"Would an exoplanet that has more ocean than Earth rotate at a different speed as a result of this? Would the amount of water impact the weight, gravitational pull, and/or tidal forces and cause a difference in the exoplanet's rotation period?  (For simplicity's sake, say, if it was earth-like in every respect other than having more ocean than Earth does at about 70% of the surface area.)   "
2795,"Are there observable changes in a star about to become supernova, minutes or hours before the explosion?","I am writing a science fiction novel, where a ship is stranded in a single star system (a red supergiant). One of the plot points is the star becoming supernova in several hours, so the characters have to fix their ship before that happens.  I have basic knowledge of how it works: Iron generated from nuclear fusion gets accumulated in the core, until it reaches a point when iron fusion starts. As iron fusion is an endothermic reaction, the core is no longer able to generate enough energy to hold against its own gravity and external layers pressure, so it collapses, and explode.  I have read that once the iron fusion starts inside the core, the collapse occurs within minutes, that the collapse itself lasts a few seconds (even less than a second), and that the shockwave takes several hours to reach the surface. Is all that correct?  The thing is that I need the characters to bee able to predict the explosion in a short term. A few hours or even minutes. It would be great if they could be aware of the core collapse and start a countdown.  So, are there any external cue of these events, like changes in luminosity or color? Does the star spectrum change when iron fusion starts, or when the core collapses? I know that the core collapse generates a huge amount of neutrinos. Is this amount so intense that it can be easily detectable? (that is, without a huge detector in an underground facility). Can the amount of iron in the core be estimated from tha star spectrum and size, so the aproximate time of the collapse could be predicted? "
2796,Relationship between precession and dating ancient alignments,"Perusing the topics here. I am convinced that this is the right place to get some answers. Although it does appear that my question should be relegated to the ""childrens table"".  I am curious to understand more about the topic in archeoastronomy that is used to date ancient alignments utilizing calculations based on precession (which I very basically understand as an imaginary circle drawn in space by the earth's axis-line as the earth wobbles).  For example a ""temple"" in Peru has been dated as being aligned with the summer SOLSTICE(es)[edited] as of 6000 years ago by unnamed experts in the field. Other unnamed experts date it at 28000 years old - to which the first set of ""experts"" grudgingly concede is ""remotely"" possible - with an absolute qualification that there was no one here to build it that far back.(Statements of absolute certainty like this and, without proof make me itchy)  First part of question is: Why the huge discrepancy in the dating? Isn't the concept of precession a proven, quantifiable fact? (OK, that was two questions.)  Second part of question is: How do the first set of experts find themselves entrenched in their dating if they must also grudgingly agree that the second dating is remotely possible? (Both groups agree that neither the Inca nor any known predecessors actually built it.)  Anything which can help me to come to grips with this dating rationale would be great.  I am not versed in astronomy whatsoever. I can barely find Sirius on a clear night. And, math is also a foreign concept as well.  What I DO understand is Ancient Civilizations.  So, I would like to understand this topic more so that I can discuss it with others in the field - without sounding like a complete idiot.  [Edit to clarify before more protests stack up] I acknowledge that I did not recall and therefore omitted the fact that non-solar stellar alignments AT THE TIME of summer solstice are the basis for this alignment-dating. At least that is the theory I am discussing. (There are others) One window frames the Sun at sunrise while another frames some star. The third window... I cannot locate a theory of what it was supposed to be for. I just wanted to understand the basis for DRIFT over time. And, the accepted answer does that very nicely. Thank you everyone "
2797,Is axial tilt critical for life?,"According to this explanation at the Georgia State University website,      Axis Tilt is Critical for Life      . . .      The Earth's spin axis is tilted 23.5° with respect to the ecliptic, giving moderate seasons and preventing temperature extremes anywhere on the planet. . . . Not only is the Earth's angle of tilt close to the optimum value, it also seems to have been essentially constant. That is crucial for the development of advanced life.    Is this claim correct?   Why does it matter if there are some areas of a planet with extreme temperatures, as long as there are other spots on the planet that are not extreme? Why are ""moderate"" seasons required for life to exist? If humans can live at the equator on Earth where there is the least amount of tilt, why would an exoplanet with less tilt or no tilt be necessarily non-inhabitable? Even if humans could not live on a planet without axial tilt, are there no other forms of known ""advanced"" life that can? We know that extremophiles exist, such as tardigrades' ability to survive in the vacuum of space.  What is the most ""advanced life"" that could live on a planet without axial tilt?  "
2798,What did I photograph?,"Last night I was experimenting with my mobile phone shooting the night sky adjusting some settings like shutter time and ISO. One of the first pictures I thought was a complete failure, I only adjusted the shutter time to 30 seconds. But when I zoomed in on what I believed to be just some bright stars, I was amazed about what I saw.  Here's the original picture    I zoomed in on the center most bright star and saw this    Then I zoomed in on that star at the bottom just a bit right of the center and saw this.    So I'm wondering what these are? Did I shoot some deep space objects? Or is this just static from the long exposure? Or maybe just pixalating from the zooming? I'm really curious about your answers.  My camera was just pointing at zenit and my location was 50°57'35.5""N 5°05'10.3""E the time was 1:06am on august the 6th 2018.  Here's a screen with some more information about the photo.   "
2799,Why aren't neutron stars full of dark matter?,"Dark matter interacts with the gravitational force right? Well, unlike black holes, neutron stars are actually visible, and they're an enormous gravitational sink, so dark matter should collect to them.   But if all that is true, which it seems to be, why haven't astronomers detected or used neutron stars to detect dark matter? "
2800,Volcano activity on moon,Are the dark grey areas on the moon formed from the last lava flows from volcanoes? And that is why there are hardly any craters in those dark grey areas because the lava has covered the old craters?And If so are there still active volcanoes that are still flowing to this day? 
2801,How can I accurately find & apply the white donut to the center of my mirror?,"I have a Plettstone 18"" Dobsonian telescope and use a Howie Glatter tuBlug, laser collimator, and Square Grid Projection Attachment to adjust the mirrors.  Proper collimation requires an accurate identification of the mirror's center. I would like to hear of good methods to very accurately place a white sticky donut concentric to the mirror's optical center.  The mirror already has a donut, but I wonder if it is accurately placed as to my eye it appears slightly off center, but perhaps the optical center is not the physical center?  I've seen a recommendation in Sky &amp; Telescope to get two clear plastic rulers that bend and place them at exact right angles to each other with the donut upside down lightly stuck to the bottom center cross point and then positioning the rulers evenly and pressing down to bend them toward the mirror and affix the donut.  However, I don't think this method is well suited for an 18"" mirror, perhaps I am mistaken?  I've also seen a recommendation by Gary Seronik to make a paper cutout that matches the mirror shape and to find its center and make a small hole and then place that over the mirror and use a pen to mark the center and center the donut around the marker, however, again, I don't think this is well suited for an 18"" mirror.  This method is also mentioned here in some detail, but they specifically state not for use with a laser collimator.  Please suggest how I can first gauge the existing donut for accuracy and if it is found to deviate significantly how to remove it and the adhesive and place a new one more accurately. "
2802,Illusion of a lunar eclipse,"A little over half a year ago, I think it was mid March 2015, I glanced out of my window at about 4 am, to see what appeared to be a very bright total lunar eclipse, as in, the moon was full and bright orange-red. As I watched, it disappeared before my eyes, looking as if someone slid a paper down in front of it. The moon was not full that night (and by extension that means that there couldn't have been an eclipse that night) and the next few nights, the moon was on the other side of the sky at 4 am.  The room I was in was dark, so it couldn't have been a reflection on the window of something inside the house. It might have been a reflection on the window of something outside the house, but that's not very likely, because it was very bright and opaque (something would have to be really bright to look so bright and opaque when reflected off a window, and I can't think of anything that would have been so bright. Plus, I probably would have noticed something something so bright), it didn't move when I moved my head around, and it looked exactly like the moon – it had the same dark and light spots. I would have taken a picture of it, it would be a lot easier to understand what I mean if you would see it, but it disappeared really fast.  It might have been a reflection on the clouds. I don't recall if there were clouds in the sky, I wasn't paying that much attention to the sky around it, because while it was happening I just thought it was an eclipse. But if it was a reflection on the clouds, there's still the question of what was being reflected.  I asked someone who knows a lot about a bunch of topics, but is not good at explaining what he means, what it could have been, and he said something about solar flares, I didn't really get what he was saying. I would ask him again, but I don't know him personally and I don't know how to contact him, and in any case, I don't think he would explain it any better the second time.  I searched everywhere I could possibly think of (on the web, on Q&amp;A sites, on SE) for a cause for this, but couldn't find anything like it.  What I'm asking is this: Could it have been a reflection on the clouds, and if so, what could it have been of? Could it have been caused by a solar flare or something like it, and if so, how? Is there an astronomical event that occurred around that time that could have caused something like that, and if so, what and how?  This question was put on hold as unclear what you're asking, so if anyone has any suggestions that can make the question more clear, I would love to hear it. I wish I could be more precise about when it happened, or what exactly it looked like, but I didn't write it down or note it in any way at the time, so this is pretty much all I remember. "
2803,What is the explanation for rapid inflation just after the big bang?,"I often hear about cosmic inflation occurring rapidly after the Big Bang, but have never came across any explanation for it. What supposedly caused this inflationary period in the early universe? Also, my assumption is that the laws of physics, i.e. light speed and relativity, did not exist during inflation, but were after effects. Is that a correct assumption? Thanks! "
2804,"In regards to the holographic principle, what exactly is information?","I'm having trouble understanding what exactly ""information"" is in the context of the holographic principle suggested by string theory. Can it be equated to a matrix of ones and zeros? Does this information have its own laws of physics or are all laws of physics in our universe a result of this information, as in, does information supersede everything?  "
2805,Do boulders erode differently on asteroids than on the Moon?,"If I understand it correctly, boulders on the Moon are only found near fresh craters, because micrometeorites erode them over time. Asteroids are believed to have formed sometimes even earlier than the Moon, but some images show asteroids covered by boulders. And NASA is planning the ARM mission to go pick up a boulder from an asteroid.  Are boulders more frequent on asteroids than on the Moon, and if so, by what kind of mechanism? For example, it is not primarily micrometeorites, but temperature changes that erodes them on the Moon. Or don't microgravity objects attract as many micrometeorites as the Moon does?

2806,Is there a radius inside of which objects are (doppler) blue shifted?,"The Andromeda galaxy is about 600,000 light years away and is doppler blue-shifted.  Are there objects closer to us than Andromeda which are red-shifted?  Are there objects farther than Andromeda that are blue-shifted?  I'm curious as to whether there is a more or less uniform radius from earth outside of which objects are generally all moving away from us, and inside of which objects are generally all moving towards us.

2807,Why would the Perseids meteor rate fall off after maximum faster than the increase before maximum?,"Writing about the 2018 occurrence of the annual Perseids meteor shower, the EarthSky.org Astronomy Essentials article Start watching for Perseids now says:     People tend to focus on the peak mornings of the shower and that’s entirely appropriate. But meteors in annual showers – which come from streams of debris left behind in space by comets – typically last weeks, not days. Perseid meteors have been streaking across our skies since around July 17. We’ll see Perseids for 10 days or so after the peak mornings on August 11, 12 and 13. What’s more, the Perseids tend to build up gradually, yet fall off rapidly. So it’s possible to catch Perseid meteors now.   Looking at images in @userTLK's excellent answer to ""What (actually) is Jupiter doing to this year's Perseids meteor shower?"" one can imagine the Earth passing through a ""fuzzy tube"" around the orbit of the shower's associated comet's orbit, which is often inclined with respect to the ecliptic.  So far I can't imagine a mechanism that would make the ramp-up and then ramp-down happen at very different rates. Why would the Perseids meteor rate fall off after maximum faster than the increase before maximum?    I've just found this artist's conception of the ""fuzzy tube"" of debris in Sky and Telescopes's “Great Show” Predicted for Perseid Meteor Peak on August 12–13.    above: ""Every year, in mid-August, Earth passes collides with particles spread along the orbit of Comet Swift-Tuttle.""

2808,How to determine atomic number density of an element in a star based on equivalent width measurements,"Given an equivalent width measurement [tex] of a spectral line of element [tex] and the effective temperature [tex] of a star, how can you determine the atomic number density of [tex] in that star?  According to Warner 1965, for the 6707.8 Lithium line we can apply the approximation  [tex]  where [tex] and [tex] must be measured. The same paper says that [tex] (my goal is to solve for the abundance of Lithium given a measured W of the 6707.8 [tex] line.  Under what regime is this approximation valid? Also, I am unable to solve this equation because I don't know what [tex] is. How can I determine a reputable value for [tex]? "
2809,"What is ""class 4 light pollution"" and could I estimate my own area's class visually?","This question currently asks     I am living in the northern hemisphere in Greece and in class 4 area (light pollution scale).Is it possible to see the Andromeda galaxy with a naked eye?   I'd never heard of a light pollution scale before. How does the scale work, and if I wanted to gauge or estimate my own area, can I do that by looking at objects in they sky visually? "
2810,Is it Possible for Planetary Bodies To Exist In Close Proximity Without Adverse Effects?,There are several sci-fi movies where planetary bodies are shown in the sky in order to indicate that the characters are on an alien planet. A good example is in Predators (2010):    Is it actually possible for such planetary bodies to exist so close to each other as to be visible in such detail to the naked eye? Wouldn't gravitational forces cause disruptions on them that inhibit the development of life (whether plant or animal)? In our Solar system there's a good example in Io which has severe volcanic activity resulting from tidal heating due to its proximity to Jupiter. 
2811,Can space-time expansion destroy light?,"I know that light shifts from high frequency(like gama rays) to low frequency (like radio waves) when traveling throw a gravitational field, this is called red shifting. My question is: Is there a limit to this, what happens to the light wave when it can no longer stretch, does it get destroyed ?  Thanks, and sorry for the dumb question, just curios.  Edit: From my knowledge and the internet :) Electromagnetic spectrum it states that light is an electromagnetic wavelength and the frequency which the wavelength travels up and down and the distance it's travel it's called spectrum and in that spectrum there is a frequency that is visible to us, but the spectrum is very large, my question is just for curiosity, I want to know if we know what happens when the light gets beyond the spectrum, can it? And I know that the expanding of space-time makes the light stretch from a high frequency spectrum to a low one, but what happens when you go to the limit of the spectrum ? can the wavelength be stretch to the point of ""breaking"" ?

2813,"What would go into the design of a simple sky quality meter, used to measure night sky brightness?","@MCG's answer mentions several methods to classify night sky quality or brightness, and goes on to say:     Additionally, you could always purchase a SQM (Sky quality meter) which is a small, portable battery powered device that you take out to your dark sky site, point it at the zenith, and the screen will display the darkness of the sky. Do beware that the SQM measures in 'magnitudes per square arcsecond' which means the higher the number, the darker the sky.   If I wanted to try to make a diy SQM, I'd need to understand if there was some established standards or practices associated with a sky quality measurement.  I might try to use a low dark current silicon photodiode in photoconductive or photovoltaic mode, low frequency couple it to a low noise op-amp, then do a cover-on measurement to zero out the leakage then do a over-off measurement to quantify the sky brightness.   What solid angle should it integrate over? Certainly more than one arcsecond, but would it be one square degree, or a 10 degree wide circle for example? Silicon covers the visual spectrum and some near infrared as well. Depending on the protective materials over it, it might measure all the way out to a micron. Is that a problem, or is light pollution pretty much in the visible part of the spectrum (for obvious reasons) and I wouldn't need to hunt for an IR-blocking filter like the ones found on imagers for cameras. With a single broadband (rather than spectrally resolved) measurement of photocurrent, I could choose a representative wavelength, or assume a flat 400-700 nm emission spectrum, or even make an educated guess about what the spectrum of noise pollution looks like, then use that along with an estimate of say 0.8 e-h pair per photon (roughly the shape of the sensitivity curve below) I could make some estimate on how much light was reaching the photodetector. But how might I convert that to magnitude? I understand the logarithmic scale, but right now I just start with 1300 W/m^2 is magnitude -27 (roughly the Sun's characteristic) as a reference. Is there anything better? Anything else I haven't thought of?     above: Silicon photodetector typical spectral response, from here. "
2814,Beamsize in radio/microwave observations,"In radio/microwave observations, I understand the beamsize is the response of the telescope to a point source - effectively, the telescope's resolution.  Now, the Planck satellite (par exemple) combines different frequency channels in a variance-weighted map. These different channels in general will have different sensitivities, and different beamsizes.   Suppose you coadd two (or any number really) of these channels. What will be the effective resolution of the resulting map? For instance, suppose we take channel 1 with a 5 arcminute beamsize (FWHM), and channel 2 with a 12 arcminute beamsize (and let's suppose they have the same sensitivity).  What will be the resolution of the inverse-variance weighted map? How will this change if the sensitivities differ? "

2816,"Formation and capture of Mars' moons, Phobos and Deimos","Mars's moons have the appearance of captured asteroids.  How could this capture have taken place.  An asteroid in solar orbit would need to loose some momentum to be captured.  The gas Giants can capture new moons through 3 body interactions between the asteroid and their existing moons,  but Mars doesn't have this issue. Airbreaking would lead to impact, not capture.   An answer here suggests that the moons could have formed recently (millions of years, not billions) after an impact ejected a substantial amount of material in Martian orbit. What is the evidence for this?  Is there an impact crater of the right size, and age? Were both moons formed together?  "
2817,What makes small interferometers useful? Like NIRISS on JWST,"NIRISS is an instrument on the James Webb Space Telescope. It has a ""non-redundant aperture mask"" which obviously covers most of the area of the sensor. It seems to be advantageous for high contrast imaging (like finding an exoplanet next to a star) and an alternative to coronagraphs. But however does that work? Why is it good to cover most of a sensor?  I have associated interferometers with creating as large as possible baselines for higher resolution, like the Very Large Baseline Array and the Spectr-R radio space telescope which gives up to a 390,000 km long baseline. So what is the magic with sacrificing sensor area to turn a single small telescope into an interferometer? Aren't all photons welcome? Would such an instrument do as well with a correspondingly smaller main mirror (maybe in separate fragments)?   "
2818,Accurate way to programmatically generate a main sequence star?,"I am working on a (personal) programming project, part of which involves generating random stars and their parameters.  In order to create a procedurally generated star, I want to randomly select as few parameter values as possible, and then extrapolate the rest using formulas.  For instance by interpreting the Stefan-Boltzmann law I can derive the star's luminosity based on the surface temperature and the star's radius:  $$ L = 4 \pi R^2 \sigma T_{e}^4 $$  There are however other parameters that I would like to generate, such as the mass of the star. What seems to be able to help me is the mass-luminosity relation:  $$ \frac{L}{L_{\odot}} = \left(\frac{M}{M_{\odot}}\right)^a $$  By knowing [tex] (based on my randomly selected mass) it seems that I can derive the star's luminosity. By glancing at the Hertzsprung–Russell diagram (e.g. this one) I can see that I can perhaps somehow calculate the radius of the star, but I'm not entirely sure how.  There is an existing star ""generator"" which can be found here, however this one interpolates existing data using logarithms.  My full question would be, is there a way to ""generate"" a ""regular"", main sequence star, starting from one or two parameters and extrapolating the rest using formulas? Is there a sensible relation between the mass of the star and its radius that can be used to generate a ""realistic"" star? Or would most parameters need to be interpolated from existing data? "

2822,Would a high albedo reflective substance cool down Venus?,"If we were to put a highly reflective substance into Venus's upper atmosphere, could we cool it down?  I am envisioning adding a highly reflective fine dust or gas, possibly lighter than ""air"" to the atmosphere.  I believe to have the proper effect, it should also reflect infrared light, which causes heat.  Apparently Venus already has a high albedo of .75 (reflects 75% of light): [website]"
2823,Would a low albedo substance warm up Mars?,"If Mars were coated in a dark substance that absorbs sunlight (including infrared light), would this heat up Mars?  I am envisioning a fine dust that is dispersed into the atmosphere, but possibly settles on Mars's surface all around.  If we were able to change the albedo, possibly down to as low as 1%, would that make Mars habitable (temperature wise)?  If the albedo were changed all the way to 1%, could this even make Mars too hot? "
2824,How (the heck) was this photo of Venus at inferior conjunction (between us and the Sun) taken?,"This great answer by @gerrit discussing planetary phases seen in visible light contains the image I've included below. According to the Wikimedia Commons link these are ESO images from the Venus transit 2004 VT-2004 observing campaign.   The ESO, or European Southern Observatory:     Organisation Européenne pour des Recherches Astronomiques dans l'Hémisphere Austral) is a 16-nation intergovernmental research organization for ground-based astronomy. Created in 1962, ESO has provided astronomers with state-of-the-art research facilities and access to the southern sky. (emphasis added)   These images are very high quality, and the last one, dated 8/6/04 (08-June-2004) appears to be taken at/near inferior conjunction, when Venus is almost directly between the observer and the Sun.  Question: I'd like to understand with what instrument this image was taken, and how the technical challenges imaging Venus with such a small angular separation between it and the Sun were overcome! I did a quick check and during the UTC day of June 8th, 2004, Venus moved from about 0.6 to 1.1 degrees from the Sun as viewed by Earth. How was Venus imaged so nicely? Was this really imaged from the ground through Earth's daytime atmosphere, or from space? In either case, how was a high quality telescope pointed so close to the Sun and shielded from stray light and protected from damage?    below: Phases of Venus, from here.   "
2825,What is at the edge of the galaxy?,The solar system is thought to have a heliopause which can be considered its edge for many purposes:  The heliopause is the theoretical boundary where the Sun's solar wind is stopped by the interstellar medium; where the solar wind's strength is no longer great enough to push back the stellar winds of the surrounding stars. This is the boundary where the interstellar medium and solar wind pressures balance.     Heliopause: the boundary between solar wind and interstellar wind where they are in equilibrium.   Is there a similar phenomenon at the interface between space dominated by the Milky Way and intergalactic space?  What is at the edge of the Milky Way galaxy?

2827,Does the ecliptic precess? Does the Sun's rotation precess?,"We know that the Earth, like a top, slowly precesses as it rotates. We know the Sun rotates, but does it precess as well? What about planetary orbits? Is the orientation of the ecliptic stable or will its inclination change over time? If so, would the orbital inclinations of the planets currently in the ecliptic change independently or in unison? We know the ecliptic is inclined with respect to the galactic plane. Would that have been a consequence of ""residual"" angular momentum when the solar system formed, or did it gradually take up its present orientation? "

2829,Is the influence of gravity instantaneous?,"When I was in college, I posed to my astronomy professor a thought experiment that had been puzzling my mind for some time: ""If all the matter in the Sun magically disappeared instantly, how long would it take its gravity to stop having an effect on us?"" His response was that the force of gravity is instant, unlike the speed of light, which appears instant.  My big question is: ""Do we know it's instant?"" We can't possibly move an object large enough to have a noticeable gravitational influence fast enough to measure if it creates (or doesn't create) a doppler-like phenomenon.  If he was wrong, how do we know it's not? "

Why is it that the secondary feels more perturbations from the gravitational influence of the sun the further away it is from the primary? "
2835,Can all astronomical signals be considered Gaussian noise?,While studying the techniques astronomers use to mitigate radio frequency interference (RFI) I found it's often assumed that astronomical signals are (band-limited) Gaussian noise.

2836,Season cycle < Year?,"Is it possible for a planet's axis to precess or wobble in such a way that its season cycle is of lesser duration than its year? The gyroscopic precession will thus give seasons to one or the other hemisphere during a possibly hundreds-year-long revolution around its star. Earth's precession is very much longer than it's revolution period, but is it possible that these could be reversed and a planet still be habitable? "

2842,Aren't there more naked-eye-visible stars in the Milky Way plane?,"Most stars which are visible to the naked eye are within 1,000 light years. The Sun is inside the Orion arm which has a diameter of about 3,500 light years. Thus, all stars (with very few exceptions) we can see unaided are inside the Orion arm and should be equally distributed in all directions. The structure of the galaxy is too large to affect the distribution of visible stars.  Still, we do see the Milky Way disk. What is it we see? The dim light of stars we can't make out individually?

2845,What are the experimental limits to the residual charge of the Sun?,"The question Can a Neutron Star become charged? and the associated comments and answers started me wondering; Are there measurements of, or experimental limits to the residual charge of the Sun?  Because the Sun has a complex atmosphere and a net solar wind, I there may be some subtleties related to what sphere is used to establish the net charge Q inside, so rather than me define a radius it may be better to see what evidence is available.   Since there is an ionized component of the solar wind and protons are 2,000 times heavier than electrons, I'm thinking that an initially neutral Sun would loose electrons more rapidly than protons, until a strong enough static field was produced that would add the extra ""push"" for the protons to leave at the same rate, but that's an extremely simplistic model.  I'm asking primarily for some kind of measurement or experimental data rather than purely rationalization or hand-waving. Has there ever been an attempted measurement of the static residual charge of the Sun? "

2847,Why does gravity increase in star formation?,"When a star ignites ( ie. fusion starts ), the star maintains its form by balancing gravity's inward pressure, and radiation's outward pressure.  I get that the fusion of hydrogen atoms releases energy... fine...  How does gravity keep it together if the mass is lessening as a result of fusion( mass being converted into energy from fusion) while gravity is weakening( as mass lessens )?

2850,Could the Earth use gravitational lensing / bending of light to see it's own bottom?,"Specifically, I have often wondered whether gravitational lensing might be able to (theoretically) be used in order to see light reflecting off the Earth that has zoomed off into space and been bent by one object after another until it comes full circle back to Earth again. Given the distance the light would have travelled, could we not use this technique to peer back through time at our own planet?   Is it reasonable that this could happen given the size of the universe and the mass and distribution of objects within it? Given the restraints above, would be be able to estimate how far back in time we are looking? Given the above, how bright would something have to be in order for its light to travel this distance and still be detectable?  "

Wikipedia has a good image of an example of gravitational lensing taken by the Hubble Space Telescope.  This brings me to wonder that, since they understand the math behind the lensing, shouldn't they be able to reconstitute the original image of the galaxy behind the galaxy that is acting as a lens?  That is, take the image and run it through a computer program that reconstructs the image using known parameters of the mass and the position of the lensing galaxy? "
2853,"What is this rapidly twinkling red, blue, and white star I saw?","Last night, I was on my balcony at 1AM (PST) and I looked up and saw two stars near the horizon (I'd guess ~30 degrees above the horizon), and they were ""twinkling"" about twice as fast as other stars higher in the sky, and I could clearly see them changing from red to white to blue repeatedly. Other stars in the sky only appeared white to me, and didn't seem to ""twinkle"" as rapidly as these two stars did. The red and blue make me think of red-shift and blue-shift, but I don't know how I would see both from the same object.  What was I seeing?  I don't know if it helps, but I am in the Los Angeles area, and I was looking in a roughly north direction. almost exactly to the east, according to google maps.  Edit: I tried taking a picture, but light pollution from the nearby street lights wouldn't permit me taking a decent picture. However, I noticed a group of three stars close together in nearly a perfect almost vertical line, and managed to find that in Stellarium. I think I found the two stars I am seeing: Procyon and Sirius    Is there anything about either of these stars that would make them show as red/blue? "
2854,Where are we in an approximate timeline of the possibly habitable universe?,"Our universe is supposedly 13+ billion years old and our Sun is a third generation star. It seems to me that we are now in a relatively young stage of the universe. How many generations of stars will there be before the end of the universe? When is 'now', relative to the all possible timepoints in the universe, that life could appear?  "
2855,What is beyond the observable universe?,"What is beyond the edge of the observable universe? Scientists say that the Big Bang is the cause of all creation in the known universe, but it would seem the bang must have happened in the center of the universe ? "
2856,Can there be an infinity of stars in the Universe?,"I have a mind puzzle.  Can there be an infinity of stars in the Universe ?  I have 2 opposed reasonings, yet I don’t find any flaw in them. Can you help me here ?  Answer A : No, the number of stars cannot be infinite.  In the whole Universe, at an instant t, there are W molecules of water. This number may be very big, but it has a definite value. The same goes for stars. Each of all the stars at the instant t has her own size, and we can give her a name. We can list all of them, and we can sort them from nearest to farthest — if we are omniscient, of course.  Answer B : Yes, the number of stars can be infinite.  Space has no finite volume. Space has no ending wall. If I advance into space, I can always go further. Wherever I go, space is by default filled with… vacuum. But it could be otherwise. [I am not sure of this point.] Space could be by default filled with… air. So there would be +∞ molecules of air in the Universe. We can apply this reasoning to stars. Let’s say there is, in average, 1 star / 1060 m3. So, in the total infinite volume of space, there would be +∞ stars. When I advance into space, I would keep meeting new stars, without end. Like in these video games in which mountains keep appearing as far as you walk. "
2857,What will the universe be like in a googolplex years time?,"It will be cold and dark in 10^(10^100) years.   What else can be said of the state of things in the far distant future? Will everything have fallen into supermassive black holes and then radiated back into space so there is no matter left?  Will the universe revert to an exotic state as it was in primordial times, or will it slow and stay unchanged indefinitely? What kind of structure will it have? "
2858,"Conversion between Astronomical Frames, ex. IRCF, FK5, FK4, etc…","I'm a little bit confused about reference frames, and I was wondering if someone could help clarify a few things?  So let's say I have equatorial coordinates that refer to the mean equator and equinox of an non standard arbitrary epoch. Now, if those coordinates are referred to the mean equator and equinox that epoch, then is the mean equator/equinox of the specific epoch considered the reference frame for those coordinates?   …and then how would you go about converting those coordinates to another reference frame like say the IRCF or FK5? I assume that I would need to precess them to J2000 accounting for any applicable proper motion (and if they referred to the true equator nutation). What else do you need to put them in either the ICRF or FK5 frames?  Also, something else I'm confused about is the epoch of a reference frame. So, let's say I have the IRCF astrometric coordinates of a planet at JD 2456963.5 TDB (or any other arbitrary date). Since they're IRCF coordinates, then the epoch of the reference frame is still J2000, but the coordinates refer to the instant of 2456963.5 TDB correct?   Any clarification would be greatly appreciated, and thanks in advance!  "
2859,How is the redshift of starlight precisely measured?,"When galaxies move away from us (caused by the expanding spacetime) their light seems to show a redshift. But what is really needed for this?  What time lap is for example needed to see a difference in frequency, and how does this precisely work?  Is this also possible for gravitational waves, or are amplitudes the only solution to derive the redshift from? "
2860,Visibility of Apollo 11 module,"I wasn't around when man landed on the moon in 1969. When I see the moon, I always wonder, were people able to see the rocket?  Yesterday, I looked at the moon in daylight and wondered again.  My question is: how far were people able to see the rocket after it launched? "
2861,Was that actually a shooting star during the supermoon eclipse on September 27th 2015?,"During the super-moon total lunar eclipse on September 27th a meteor-like streak passed very close within view of the event. It appeared to happen at the very middle, the maximum eclipse.   [CafferyPhoto][1]  At the time, I thought it must have been some organization shedding an unused satellite. This would be a pretty epic time to do so as so many eyes around the world are looking at the same thing. Maybe even NASA marking the halftime of the event. Can anyone confirm or shed any amount of light on what this was?   [1][[website]note - photo for proof only - shutter cut off leading edge  QUESTIONS:  People on the Caffery's Facebook page seem to have seen in in California and other locations as well, I happened to be in St Thomas, Virgin Island at the time of the event.

2862,Do sungrazing comets leave a field of meteoroids near the Sun?,"A large fraction (a third?) of all comets found (with observational bias thanks to SOHO) have been sungrazers, breaking up with perihelion of a few of Sun's radius. Is there reason to believe that this replenishes some kind of vulcanoid population of small objects? Or would they evaporate and be blown away by the Solar wind, or continue in their comet's orbit, or be ejected by Mercury's eccentricity? Would the constant replenishment, even now, not billions of years ago, help keep a population there in spite of all above?   "
2863,What's the difference between a Newtonian telescope and a regular telescope,"So, recently I was shopping for telescopes and I decided on the following telescope:  [website]I had exactly $180 to spend, and that telescope fit the bill. However, I also noticed that it had a variety of options in sizes, mainly the following:   60MM EQ Refractor  70MM EQ Refractor  80MM EQ Refractor 114MM EQ Reflector 127EQ Newtonian Reflector   What is the difference between all these sizes/types, how does a ""Newtonian Reflector"" act differently than a ""regular"" (for lack of a better term) reflector and what are the benefits/drawbacks?   Bonus Points: Did I choose the ""highest-quality"" option for the price?    Side-by-side comparison of all sizes:   "

2866,Assume that a star has a uniform mass density. Then how does the temperature scale as a function of the distance to the center?,"Assume that a star has a uniform mass density. Then how does the temperature scale as a function of the distance to the center? Note: I am not looking for an answer that involves derivations or integrations.  Here is what I did: The star is in equilibrium so the pressure at distance [tex] must equal the gravity force at distance [tex]. Pressure is given by [tex], and so [tex]. Then [tex]. The mass of the part of the star contained within radius [tex] from the center is [tex] where [tex] is the mass of each particle and [tex] is the number of particles per volume. Then we can rewrite [tex] and simplify to [tex]. Isolating [tex] we get that [tex]. This seems to imply that the temperature decreases the further we are from the core, however I am not sure what [tex] should stand for in [tex], should [tex], i.e be the mass of a single particle? Or does [tex] itself depend on the radius in which case the answer I got is invalid. Can someone verify that the answer I got is right? Thanks "
2867,What happens to oxygen produced on the Sun (or other stars)?,"Through nuclear fusion, the Sun can (or at the very least, someday will) produce atoms of all elements up to and including oxygen.  And in terrestrial chemistry at least, when you combine oxygen, hydrogen, and a small amount of heat you get water.  Or lithium and oxygen and heat will produce lithium oxide.  Those individual components are all readily available in a star like the Sun.  So my questions is, does the oxygen produced by the Sun (or any other star, now, in the future, or in the past) react chemically (for instance, through oxidation or combustion processes) with the other elements present in the star's atmosphere?    Or I suppose more generally, do the elements formed through nuclear fusion in a star chemically interact to produce more complex molecules (and if not, then why not)? "
2868,Why does this twilight sky flat field have a grid of dark pixels?,"The image below is a small region of a twilight flat field. A grid of darker pixels with 728x36 cell dimensions can be seen.   The camera used was the SBIG STL-6303 according to the FIT headers, which uses a Kodak KAF-6303E CCD according to the online data sheet.  The CCD dimensions, these cell dimensions, and all the binning options are all perfectly divisible, so I'm assuming this artifact is due to the structure of the CCD.  I plotted the mean pixel value of each row to make sure this wasn't an artifact from the image viewing software. The plot clearly shows a drop every 36 pixels.  So, I'm hoping for some confirmation: is this decreased sensitivity due to the structure of the CCD?  If so, what about the CCD structure actually causes this? "
2869,Does all of time exist and if so where is it?,"I've recently learned about the theory of relativity and time.  I'm trying to understand it more.    My (basic) understanding is that there is no distinction between past present and future and that all of time already exists.  If this is true, what prevents us from seeing the past and the future? And/Or what causes us to only be able to see the ""present""? "
2870,Units of integrated flux density (irradiance) along longitudes,"If I've taken an image of the Galactic bulge with the pixel units in MJ per steradian:   and I've looked down each column of the image and added up the values:  then do the units change? My thinking is that I'm taking something that is measured per steradian (which is a solid angle) and integrated it along a single axis, which would be in degrees. Would this make the units of my graph now MJ per radian? Or am I simply adding values in MJ per sr, so the units don't change? "
2871,"Are there equal number of planets, stars, galaxies etc in observable universe spinning in both directions?","Just because we observed that our milky way galaxy is spinning in a certain direction therefore we assume it is applicable to all other galaxies, I am curious to find out if hypothetically most of the celestial objects such as natural satellites, planets, stars even galaxies within our observable universe are spinning/rotating in the same direction as the milky way what kind of implications can we say about the condition in the early universe? or is it just an coincident?  "
2872,Date and time system on moons,"Supposedly, if humans were to establish a colony on one of the moons of a planet (such as gas giants in our own solar system), how could we possibly design date and time system? On Earth, we define date based on rotation about Sun and time on Earth's revolution. But, with a moon of another planet, this will add another factor to date/time system. So, how can we cope with this?  PS: I am not sure about what tags this question should carry. Feel free to correct them. "
2873,Is extraterrestrial mining more difficult or impractical for bodies without plate tectonics?,"This article talks about the possibility of mining Uranium on the moon. Since the Moon lacks the geological forces that have created veins of concentrated minerals on Earth, would extraterrestrial mining be more difficult or impractical? How does Moon, Martian, or asteroid mining overcome the lack of mineral veins otherwise formed by Earth's geology?   It seems like extraterrestrial mining would be at least as difficult as trying to refine desert sand, which isn't a thing.  A short video on how gold veins form  Wayfaring Stranger added an interesting link on ore genesis. "
2874,Eccentricity and Inclination of a Star,"I understand Planetary Eccentricity and Inclination.  However when it applies to a star, does the centre or ecliptic plane refer to the Sun or the Galactic Centre?  The star Sirius for example, 136.336 ± 0.040° inclination, the angle at which it is inclined to Sun, Earth or Galactic Centre?  The star Sirius has an Eccentricity of  0.59142 ± 0.00037.  The only thing the star orbits is the Galactic Centre (Sagittarius A*) so I guess that is the centre? "
2875,Ratios of magnitudes instead of differences,"The color index in the photometric system is defined by the differences in magnitudes between two wavelength filters, which gives the ratio of intensities. For example, to determine the B-V index, you'd need the magnitudes in the B band (which is centered on [tex]nm) and in the V band, centered on [tex]nm.  But what about other operations? For instance, would there be any significance in taking, say, the ratio [tex] or [tex]? "
2876,Calculate NEO object position with nasa Near Earth Object data,"I wish to create a 3D visualisation of NEO's by date in relation to earth, but calculating their position at that time has got me stuck.

Is it possible to calculate the position of the NEO in relation to earth? It doesn't seem to offer any positional information that I can see, although this is not my field.  Or is there a better data set which will assist me in this? "
2877,Can we compress any object to create black Holes?,"In general, when a star runs out of nuclear fuel, gravity gets the upper hand and the material in the core is compressed even further and creates black holes. I am clear till  here.   Now the question is, Is it depends on the mass of the star (or Object)?  Naturally, the more massive the core of the star, the greater the force of gravity that compresses the material and easy to create Black Hole.   For smaller stars, when the nuclear fuel is exhausted and there are no more nuclear reactions to fight gravity, the repulsive forces among electrons within the star eventually create enough pressure to halt further gravitational collapse. The star then cools and dies PEACEFULLY.   If you accept till here, my question is, in the science videos and discussions, they say that, we can create Black hole from any object, i mean for example, if we are able to compress EARTH to the size of the Tennis Ball, then we can create Black Hole, Is it True?   Doesn't the Nuclear Fusion / Reaction is necessary to create Black Hole. Of course to fight against gravity we may require some kind of energy in this case, Nuclear reactions. But i am generally concerned like, does Nuclear Reaction is only to fight gravity, it does not play any other role in creating Black Hole. "
2878,What is a probability of a particle launched from earth hitting any object in the universe?,"Imagine I pointed a laser into the night sky. How likely is it that a particular photon will ever hit anything?  This question bothered me for a while. I know very little about astronomy. When I asked my roommate he laughed and said that it must be very little, since the universe is mostly empty. I know it is true, but it seems to me that volume of the objects in the universe does not matter. Rather, it should be the area of objects when projected on a sphere that matters.   On one hand, universe is pretty empty, so hitting something outside the Solar System might be hard. But on the other hand, there are a lot of possible targets. These targets, however, appear smaller when the distance increases.  Which one of these, or other, forces will dominate? Would it make a difference if we ignored gravity? "
2879,What would be the maximum theoretically possible angular resolution?,"I have studied some basic astronomy, but I have difficulty conceptualizing the physics of luminosity and optics.  We use electromagnetic spectra to detect existence and properties of distant planets, but I am curious about the extent of what could theoretically be optically captured.    (I am unsure if optical is the correct term, but I'm referring to what could be directly captured vs. computed.)  Assuming the use of technology far beyond what we currently are capable of, what is the maximum possible optical angular resolution we could theoretically obtain of a distant sky object?  Or, for example, of the surface topography of an outer planet/moon/dwarf planet?    What would be the limiting factor at the extreme end of possible angular resolution? "
2880,What if we are looking for the wrong signs of life on other planets?,"I am by no means an astronomy expert, having only taken 2 semesters in college. But I am an avid follower of news reports that look for signs of life on other planets. Today it was announced that 20 new planets ""with the potential for life"" have been found. Along with the usual signs (temperature and water) these planets were also cited because one of them has a year of 395 Earth days, a very similar year to our own.   However, I'm always bothered by these reports because they are all predicated on the premise that life on other planets will closely resemble our own. What if life on other planets doesn't need water? What if they are not carbon-based life forms? What if they can live in extremely hot (or extremely cold) temperatures?  It just seems like a massive mistake to (effectively) say, ""this planet doesn't look anything like ours, there must be no life there"" or to imply that only Earth qualities (or similar) can support life. Are there any fields of astronomy that look beyond the ""near-Earth"" life comparisons and look for life in other (drastically different) forms?  "
2881,Is this photocomposition of Andromeda's galaxy and the Moon accurate?,"I recently saw the below image circulating around twitter/facebook/reddit. It is titled ""Andromeda's actual size if it was brighter""    One of the comments provides a link to another comparison provided by APOD, and the following comment mentions that the first one I linked seems a bit off.  Is the first image accurate in term of relative sizes? What is the relative angular size of Andromeda's galaxy and the Moon? "
2882,How has the estimate of the number of stars in the universe changed over time?,"Current estimates for the number of stars in the universe are about 10^22. However, that number has changed several times as new observations have come forth. How has the estimate of the number of stars in the universe changed over time? What was the estimate after Hubble's findings? What was the estimate in the 70s, 90s, etc., and what new discoveries forced those estimates to change?  "
2883,How actively is Deep Learning being used in exoplanet identification?,"Papers, like this one from Google, show that Deep Learning and Machine Learning are effective in detecting exoplanets from luminosity data provided by telescopes like TESS or Kepler.  These models seem extremely quick and lightweight. Has it become somewhat of a standard practice to use these on freshly obtained TESS data? If not, why, and what is done with the data instead? Are there drawbacks to using these seemingly accurate models? "
2884,Are objects in the universe moving away from each other at the same acceleration?,"This is a follow up question to Does the universe expand at the same rate everywhere in the universe?.  If the universe is expanding, then it would seem necessary for each object (ie galaxy) to be accelerating away from every other object at the same rate of acceleration which is constant (or not?). If that is true, what is the acceleration?  In other words, relative to the Milky Way, does it seem that all the other galaxies are moving directly away from us at the same rate of acceleration? If so, is it possible for us to prove that for any other galaxy that we know, the same observation would be true, were we able to view the universe from that galaxy? "
2885,Is it possible that a satellite creates a forever eclipse?,"So, to add a bit of context, I’m doing the NaNoWriMo challenge, which consists of writing a novel of 50k words in one month. My whole idea is based around the following question: What would happen if the sun were to suddenly disappear?  To make it short, the story is about a colony on a faraway planet, which is settled for few generations already. And one day or let’s say, in less than a month, the sun disappear. So far, so good. Except I need a valid reason as to why the sun disappear… I have found some ideas (dust from volcanic eruption, change of orbit, dying sun, etc…) but none of them looked good enough. (I’m open for suggestion if any.)  I’m now investigating the possibility that the planet would gain a satellite big enough to hide the sun on the whole planet (like an eclipse but lasting forever). This topic lead me to think that if the satellite is in geostationary orbit, it is possible. But there is still some questions I can’t get my head around.   How fast a new satellite can “appear”? Is it possible that a bigger but “lighter” (with less gravitational force) satellite can orbit around a smaller but “heavier” planet? This topic reminded me that no sun means no heat. Can the geothermic activity of a planet be enough to prevent the surface from being impossible to live on? (Off topic.)   So, basically, the question is, if it's possible to have a forever eclipse, how ?  I’m sorry in advance if the questions are not clear enough, even though I understand the basics, I don’t necessarily have all the technical terms.  Thank you !! "
2886,How do we know that our galaxy is a spiral galaxy?,"I know that our galaxy is spiral in shape, but I'm wondering how the scientists found out that our galaxy has a spiral shape.  I don't think we can see the entire galaxy from telescopes on Earth, right?  I think it makes sense that they say that Andromeda has a spiral shape because we can see the whole galaxy, but how do scientist know about our galaxy? "
2887,What does the active area on a typical CCD based detector look like?,"Pixel based detectors, particularly optical CCDs like what was used in the SDSS camera, are ubiquitous in astronomy. Is there any dead area on the detectors? Not the obvious gaps between each individual sensor, but on the sensor itself. That is, does a typical detector have any gaps between the pixels from microscopic wires laid on the front, alternating doping regions in the silicon, or just areas where a photon can hit and the photo-electron is unlikely to be collected? What fraction of the area is dead? "
2888,C-Type Asteroids and Carbonaceous Chondrite Meteorites,"I was just wondering, what is the relationship between C-type asteroids and carbonaceous chondrite (CC) meteorites? Do CC meteorites come from C-type asteroids? "
2889,How bright can white dwarf stars glow as they accrue matter?,"I realize this is kind of general as it would depend on the size of the white dwarf and the rate of accrual.    The general idea I got thinking about is what would happen if a white dwarf star - lets say 0.8 solar mass, well below Chandrasekhar was to accrue a bunch of hydrogen rather quickly.  I thought it might be get very hot and bright, perhaps similar to a red giant for a relatively brief period of time.  Mostly White dwarfs add mass by siphoning from the outer layer from a near by co-orbiting star, but I imagine, that mostly happens quite slowly, not fast enough to make the white dwarf shine like a main sequence star.    Are there studies on how quickly mass can be added in this way and how bright it makes the white dwarf?  Does Hydrogen quickly fuse on the surface of a white dwarf or does it need to build up to a certain thickness first, perhaps creating a mini flash? or does the fusion happen rather quickly.  A very rough calculation, the escape velocity of a white dwarf, which would be similar to the terminal velocity of matter (mostly hydrogen) falling into it is about 5,500,000 meters/second for a 1 solar mass white dwarf.  Source.   The velocity needed for hydrogen fusion is about 20,000,000 meters per second.  Source (under the what makes fusion hard section).   So, white dwarf's aren't massive enough to create fusion upon impact, but the high density and high heat of impact seems like it could create fusion relatively quickly as matter builds up around them, perhaps creating something that perhaps glows like a star and expands rather rapidly - assuming there's a sustained burn and not a kind of very quick explosion of sorts.   I think it could glow very hot and perhaps expand rather large, but I'm just kind of guessing.  If a white dwarf was to crash into, say, a brown dwarf or very low mass star, hydrogen rich, say about .1 solar mass?   Such a brown dwarf would be much larger than the white dwarf but also quite a bit lighter, probably light enough to get penetrated completely though the impact would also likely create fusion and it's difficult for me to imagine what would happen with so violent a crash.   It seems to me that the density of the white dwarf, if it could retain most of the matter from the brown dwarf would be sufficient that you'd be left with a fast burning light weight fusion star, with a very dense core.   This might be an impossible question, but how quickly would a .8 solar mass white dwarf consume the hydrogen from a .1 solar mass brown dwarf, should this rare kind of collision happen.   Would it actually form a star-like object for a period of time, say a million years or so, or would the enormous energy of impact basically blow it apart no new star?  Perhaps a near miss and an inside the Roche limit approach would be better than a direct impact for new star formation.  Thanks. "

Now, when I run it, I get the following for these examples:  2000-01-01 12:00:   jdn = 2451545.0, n = 0.0, L = 280.46, g = 357.528, lambda_ = 280.375680197, T = 0.0, epsilon = 23.4392794, alpha = -78.7141369122, GMST = 18.697374558   result: 201.74648145775257  2000-03-20 07:35:   jdn = 2451623.81597, n = 78.815972222, L = 358.144758099, g = 75.2090537484, lambda_ = 360.006175505, T = 0.00215934170471, epsilon = 23.4375937902, alpha = 0.00566598789588, GMST = 19.4596915825   291.9010397253072   As you can see, the first query (noon on Jan 1, 2000) now has a correct Julian day number. At noon GMT, I would expect the sun to be above a longitude near 0, so 201 is incorrect.  The second query is the time of the spring equinox in 2000, which I expected to result in zeroing out the sidereal part of the calculation, but it does not.  I attempted to consult the NASA HORIZONS web interface for ephemerides for the sun on 1/1/2000 at noon GMT, for both ""Geocentric"" and Greenwich locations, but I don't know how to evaluate the result and compare it to my work above.

2891,How big can a rocky planet get?,"If I get the numbers right, at about 17 Jupiter masses a mainly gaseous planet would ignite into some type of star. What about rocky planets? Is there a theoretical limit to their size, so that they can grow up to size x? (I'm imagining a ""liquid"" planet would congeal into rock after certain gravity value, and would somehow fit into the ""rocky class"" as well). "
2892,Does time slow down because the universe is expanding at an accelerating rate?,"If the universe is expanding at an accelerating rate, such that the galaxies' moving away from each other is accelerated, then time should also slow down. And when universe will accelerate to the speed of light, then time should stop.  Does time slow down because universe is expanding at an accelerating rate? Can any physicist explains if this is true or not? "
2893,Visibility of human activity on the moon,"In this video the host of Test Tube Plus states that   you can go out a buy a laser, point it at the moon, and see the retroreflector left by the astronauts.  When you point at the right spot you'll see a reflection, elsewhere not.  He reiterates that this is not just a hypothetical use of 2nd person for effect, but that you the viewer can go out and try this yourself, and anyone paying any attention to moonlanding conspiracy theories ought to try it tracks and artefacts at the landing site can be seen with amateur telescopes, and again this is approachable to anyone who cares to look   Neither of these seem correct to me.  Could someone with real numbers weigh in on this?  I seem to recall that seeing artefacts is only possible in the latest high-res images taken from lunar orbit, and the telescope that uses the reflector gets back single photons on some trials and is a much more powerful laser than you could buy!  But, a continuous beam may be different? How big of a laser would you need to see a reflection with a viewing instrument that doesn't cost more than the laser? "
2894,Trying to categorize moon phase using fraction illuminated,"I have a dataset with events that are occurring over a period of 5 years. I am trying to determine whether these events are related to moon phase. I downloaded the ""fraction of moon illuminated"" for the time period, but am struggling to define the cutpoints for crescent, quarter, and gibbous. These are defined by the USNO as 0.25, 0.5, and 0.75 ([website]Can anyone help me determine the fraction illuminated (y) that corresponds to these outpoints?  0 days  3.69132375 days  7.3826475 days  11.07397125 days  14.765295  days  18.45661875  days  22.1479425  days  25.83926625  days  ???

2895,Can a gas moon exist?,"Could a gaseous moon exist in the same way as a giant gas planet? All the moons in the solar system are rocky, or icy. Why shouldn't gas planets  have gas moons?  "
2896,Can the Moon eclipse Venus?,"The title basically says it all. As seen from the Earth, is it possible for the Moon to eclipse Venus (or any other planet) or are the orbits inclined such that this never happens?  If such an eclipse is possible, is it a frequent or infrequent event? How would I find out when the next one occurs? "
2897,Has the Big Crunch been ruled out?,"If the dark energy equation of state [tex] evolves with time, and becomes larger, this would result in decelerated expansion and eventually a Big Crunch. If [tex] decreases with time, becoming more negative, then a Big Rip would occur. I understand that the Big Rip has not yet been ruled out by current observations, but I often hear that the Big Crunch has been ruled out since we know the universe is expanding (and accelerating).  If the Big Rip can't currently be ruled out, then how can the Big Crunch be ruled out? Shouldn't they both still be on the table, unless we can somehow infer which direction [tex] evolves in under a quintessence model? "
2898,What happens to the momentum of a star as its mass is converted to energy?,"Stars move relative to many frames of reference.  We can use the CBR for this question, I suppose, but it may not matter.  Their momentum p=mass x velocity.  Stars lose mass as it is converted to energy. Percentage-wise it isn't much, but it is tons per second, so it isn't negligible. What happens to the momentum of the star as it loses mass? Presumably it is conserved, so does the velocity of the star increase?  Or does the overall system carry off some momentum with the energy, leaving the stellar velocity constant? "
2899,What type of telescope can show cliffs on the moon surface from a city location?,"I am a complete novice in this world and I would like a telescope where I could have enough power to view the moon's surface, I don't expect to see the flag or the hover sending signs to me, but perhaps enough to view cliffs, and other details from the surface of it and perhaps from other places.  I honestly don't even know what kind of telescope to purchase. I live in a capital city, so there is a lot of light around here. My apartment is high with a balcony, which is where I would place it and there is nothing in front of me from there.   What kind of telescope would fit my needs? Are there reputable online stores that I could consult?   I have a $500 budget for this and honestly, I have no clue about specs or anything, I am a completely novice in this field. "
2900,Would this effect occur if an ice planet was put into orbit or trajectory?,"Imagine an earth getting warmer. Humans decide to make their homes ready for a voluntary ice age. All the space agencies work together to get an icy planet/moon into our orbit between us and the sun.  My theory is that because the sun is heating up the ice and blowing it in the direction of earth, it'll make the Earth colder.  That final part is my question: Could ice molten in space eventually reach earth and perhaps be pushed in that direction by its heat?? Not taking into account whether or not it would benefit the earth.  I'm an amateur with no knowledge of physics, chemistry and astrology and want to learn answers to my questions.  Thanks in advance! "
2901,How do we measure distance in space?,"I know that you can calculate the distance to another star for example, by using the phenomenon redshift to determine how much it has redshifted because of the expansion of the universe. But how do you know what the original frequency/wavelength of the light was? (And if all of my above statements are wrong, how do you measure the distance?) "
2902,Astronomy questions I wondered for hours,"I read a question posted by a community member in my community that shocked me, I think it contains some pretty cool astronomy questions that I cant wait for you scientists to answer. I am asking this from stack exchange, because this is where all the real scientists are , and I want to see the truth , a real explanation , brief but simple.  I wont copy the exact question details because it will make it duplicate, but the question is posted here, please take time to read the details and explain it to me it is posted here-  [website]I am fascinated by his explanation, I cant wait for the astronomy community to tell me the answers this guy is asking.  Ok this is the question I am pasting it here after being requested by a member on the comment section-  His tite is -  How can i convince my atheist friend that God exists???  Apparently he seems to be religious person, who has some points to make. This is the description of his question-     There is this friend that I have who believes in science and doesnt believe in religion. We have had many arguements, and it raises many interesting questions. I am posting this to see Answercup users opinion on it. If scientists say that Big bang is proven I have some simple questions . What happened before the big bang according to these scientists? And this big bang theory came from scientists thinking that the universe expands so if we reverse the time, it will do the opposite and come to one single point....but then if it did come from a point, I found that the expansion is INCREASING which is weird. How on earth can it be a blast , because obv like any blast it should decreases and come to a hault , here instead of the universe expansion decelerating its actually accelerating. How can these so called scientists tell something is right when common sense which can be understood by primary school children shows clearly that they are wrong ??? Plus how can you seriously get a blast from empty space ? If scientist says thats the beginning of time.   With his question, I remembered watching the vedio ""Does god exist"" on Discovery channel by stephen hawking. His explanations wasnt complete and he bragged about how there is no need for god, but his explanation never explained many parts. And then there are scientists who gives the excuse laws of physics break at the point of the big bang so we can't explain. So this brought my mind a new question, if scientists still cant understand what has happens in the big bang , how can they tell that God doesnt exist, and stuff like that and make them appear as facts, if they knew the physics at the big bang and talked then its fine, but here they are talking without even knowing those.

2903,Average number and type of planets orbiting given star types,"I don't need ""exact"" numbers, but I'm trying to create an auto-generator for a stellar map to crate stars that are ""somewhat"" accurate.  I'm looking for numbers on the average number and type of planets around each type of Star, and whether they could be a good source for mining or are they good places for life?  So, like, I need an idea of how what is the average number of planets that are expected around a G class star, how many are expected to be Gas giants or terrestrial and what is the likelihood of them being in the habitable zone and containing life.   If I base it on Sol I would suspect about 10 planets, 50% terrestrial and 50% gas giants, with 1 to 3 in the habitable zone and a 30% chance of life developing. I'm looking for something similar to this type of information.  I assume this wouldn't be good for across the board or even for G class stars in general.  So I guess I'm looking for estimated planetary statistics based on spectral type? I don't want a list of exoplanet and stars that I have to look through and then make a bad guess at, but a good estimation of these numbers based on known facts.  This Question doesn't have a simple enough answer for me to grab onto to use effectively without just making too much stuff up anyways.  This Question seems to have pieces of information that I'd use to work something out, but it would likely by far more inaccurate than what other people would come up with and there might be better answer than that so I ask my question.

2904,What is the speed of gravitational waves ?,"I read that two huge black holes collided or merged and so it created gravitational waves billion years ago , So now we are able to detect it &amp; detected it. So what is the speed of gravitational wave ? Is it faster than light ? and  are there many more to be detected ? "
2905,Do supernovae produce powerful gravitational waves?,"I would think that the amount of energy produced by one supernova is much more than a pair of colliding black holes, no? Wouldn't that much material and energy output from the explosion generate a powerful gravitational wave? "
2906,What is the escape velocity of our Galaxy relative to?,"I've been thinking that everything has a relative escape velocity, if it has Mass, seemingly. You can escape orbit around the earth by accelerating enough. You can escape the orbit of the sun by accelerating enough. Heck, this is kind of a stretch, but even electrons can escape an atom relative to how much electric charge the nucleus holds. What would it be like to escape the orbital velocity of our Galaxy-- and what exactly would it be relative to-- a black hole at the center of the Galaxy?   The quote was:     Solar system's orbital velocity is estimated at roughly 220 km/s, and galactic escape velocity for our vicinity at about 537 km/s. So in the direction of Solar system's velocity vector, velocity required to escape Milky Way is ~ 317 km/s. And much more, if this Solar system's own orbital momentum cannot be used to full extent and a launch in other directions is required. This is of course assuming you can launch on a trajectory that avoids getting too close to gravitational influence of other solar systems.   How in the world do you calculate the escape velocity of other galaxies let alone our own-- do we know what the solar systems in the Milky Way orbit and how they orbit it?  "
2907,Why isn't the day backwards between leap years?,"So every four years, we add an extra day. A leap year. This is because a year is actually [tex] days long. But what happens between leap years? After two years, it would get dark at 8:00 AM instead of 8:00 PM. This is obviously not the case. What's going on here? "

2910,What would the effects be on Earth if Jupiter was turned into a star?,"In Clarke's book 2010, the monolith and its brethren turned Jupiter into the small star nicknamed Lucifer.  Ignoring the reality that we won't have any magical monoliths appearing in our future, what would the effects be on Earth if Jupiter was turned into a star?  At it's closest and furthest:    How bright would the ""back-side"" of the earth be with light from Lucifer?    How much heat would the small star generate on earth?    How many days or months would we actually have night when we circled away behind the sun?  How much brighter would the sun-side of earth be when Lucifer and the sun both shine on the same side of the planet? "
2911,Hour angle sunrise calculation problem,"I am trying to program a sunrise/sunset calculator using this formula tutorial.  If you follow the steps, eventually you get to this formula for ""H"" (the ""hour angle""):  [tex]  Which comes with a note attached:  Note: If H is undefined, then there is either no sunrise (in winter) or no sunset (in summer) for the supplied latitude.

2014   You'll notice there are quite a lot of dates where H (the hour angle) is undefined. I understand from a trigonometric standpoint why it is incalculable, but is there a scientific reason for this? Also, how do they calculate when the sun will set and when the sun will rise on those days? Is it an average of the last known date and the next known date?  What is the hour angle, exactly, and how do you calculate the sunrise/sunset if you can't calculate it? "
2912,Do all stars of a given age and mass have relatively the same emission spectrum?,"My understanding is that much of the visible light that we see during the day is given off from the Sun, and that means that most of the colors that we see are dictated by (with the exception of atmospheric effects) the particular wavelengths of color that the Sun emits, which does not include the entire continuous color spectrum.  Here is an image of the wavelengths emitted by the Sun  My understanding is also that, at least during a particular part of the life cycle of a star, all stars are burning balls of hydrogen and helium. If that is the case, then do all stars at that point in their life give off emission spectra of visible light that is similar to our own? Is it possible that an observer on a planet with an atmosphere similar to that of Earth might see different ranges of color than we do, simply due to, perhaps, the composition of their star? Could there be planets similar to Earth where the sky would appear purple rather than blue?  Let me know if any of my assumptions are incorrect. "
2913,Gallery of 'actual images' from space?,"Where can a gallery of actual unaltered photographic images taken in (or of) space be found?

Pictures and videos claiming ""actual image"" are few and far between.  E.g., this:    Not false color:    Both of these pictures are from NASA's (Voyager) Saturn Images gallery. Some of the other ones there are listed as false color, some aren't (but obviously they are). Or maybe not so obviously, hence the question: what does it really look like out there?  I've a pretty good idea of what Saturn looks like IRL, because I've seen it in a telescope (exactly like the first picture, except it's more colorful - absolutely nothing like the second). For most other celestial objects, I have no such baseline.  The title of the website I'm looking for would be along the lines of: View of our solar system through the eyes of a human. Decidedly, not containing any pictures from the HST, as all of them are photoshopped. "
2914,"How to choose portable, yet powerful telescope","Due to the nature of my job, I have to spend log periods of time (4 - 6 months each), at different countries across Europe, Middle East and Far East. I have a 12 Inch Dobsonian at home, but I rarely spend 1 month a year, at home. Travelling with the Dob is out of question due to its weight and I don't always have access to low lying windows or a rooftop when abroad, making a dob pretty useless. I really want to have at one, at least 8"", portable option while I'm travelling. Celestron NexStar 8 SE is looking good to me at the moment. It seems to have half the weight of an 8"" scope with equatorial mount and from what I've heard, it can be used table-top, without tripod. I can also carry the OTA in hand luggage, to avoid damage to optical components. Can someone confirm if   (i) Does 8SE work on tabletop without tripod? (ii) How durable is the mount? Can it survive transportation in checked baggage, if placed in its original packaging? (iii) Any other suggestions for a scope that is at or above 8"" and can be carried around easily when travelling internationally?  "
2915,how does Kepler stop exposure after a 5 minuate or 30 minute cadence time?,"There are two kinds of cadence time for Kepler, 5 minutes and 30 minutes. I just know there is no shutter and the CCDs of Kepler can be locked after exposure. handbook  But how to realize that? Remember we have to not affect the photometry.  The other question is so far how many unique sources has Kepler observed? 160,000?  "
2916,absolute speed of bodies as observed by a distant observer,"What does a distant observer see if two masses with a given velocity are close enough to each other that time is dilated ?

A galaxy should be an irregular blob if close, but if it is far away then it would seem that a galaxy too would be just a point source.   Given that the star and galaxy were both only detectable as point sources can astronomers tell them apart with redshift? By some other method?  A followup question...  What percentage of galaxies if our universe can we only detect as point sources?  "
2919,"Sun's formation as ""part of a star-forming-cluster...""?","After reading this interesting answer,  I was wondering, do we in fact know if our Sun in particular was created as part of a star-forming-cluster, or, was it more of a solo creation?  (Or, are all stars created as part of star-forming-clusters, is that the norm and how all stars come to be?)  If yes, indeed are we aware of which stars around us, are our sibling star?  (So, there's a list somewhere ""stars known to likely be sibling to our Sun from a certain star-forming-cluster"".)  Or have they dispersed over the 4 billion years and it's impossible to know, or is it just the case that ""all the stars anywhere nearby"" are/were indeed siblings from ""our"" star-forming-cluster?  Further, I'm having trouble grasping the order of magnitude of star-forming-clusters. Consider say ""all the stars in our arm of the galaxy"": Consider the question ""in how many star-forming-clusters did all those stars originate?""  Is the answer like ""3"", ""a few hundred"" or ""100 million"" ??  Perhaps most simply: if sol formed as part of a star-forming-cluster, what's the order of magnitude of how many stars formed with it? "
2920,How are constraints on dark energy improved the most?,"Today we have various data available from independent probes to constrain dark energy, i.e. its equation of state [tex]. These include Type 1a supernovae, BAO, CMB, large-scale galaxy surveys, etc. Are any of these probes better/more powerful at constraining dark energy than the others? Why or why not?   For example, I assume that if a galaxy survey includes 1000 galaxies in a redshift range [tex], that would result in higher constraints on [tex] than just using 500 Type 1a supernovae in a range [tex]. But how much of a difference does this, among other factors I'm unaware of, make? Quantitatively, how do the errors/uncertainties scale with larger samples and larger redshift intervals (I think for a larger sample the uncertainty decreases as [tex])?  It also makes sense that dark energy models with more free parameters would come with a larger uncertainity (for example, [tex] has 1 more free parameter, [tex], than [tex]). But how much is the constraining power diminished for each new degree of freedom? See plots (Figure 9, [website]In the plot on the right, clearly the constraints are much looser because more free parameters were introduced in fitting the data to this time-dependent dark energy model. We can also see that the SN1a data, for example, seems to constrain dark energy less than CMB or BAO data. Why is this? Is it because SN1a have only been observable at lower redshifts so far? "
2921,Could the closest approach of stable orbits of two earth sized planets allow life to jump between?,"How close could two earth sized celestial bodies get in their nearest approach either as planets or moons around a larger planet?  Close enough for atmospheric interaction in a stable orbit at nearest approach, or for non-space-fairing species to somehow make the jump without cosmological assistance (aka asteroid impact)?  It seems just from using the roche limit of an earth to earth sized bodies any approach under ~20,000 km would be unstable in the long term, which is orders of magnitude beyond a normal atmosphere size. "
2922,"How did the reionization epoch make the universe ""transparent""?","I've been reading about the reionization epoch of the universe, and it isn't entirely clear to me.    As I understand it, very shortly after the big bang the universe was ionized, with the electrons stripped from the protons of hydrogen. The way that it's described is that the universe was ""opaque"" (since it was filled with ionized gas). Then the universe cooled enough for neutral hydrogen to form again, and the universe became ""transparent"". When the first stars and galaxies began to form they reionized the universe.    What I don't understand is that in illustrations of this reionization, during the reionization epoch, it seems that the universe isn't transparent, but filled with unionized IGM (neutral hydrogen). Then the ionizing radiation from the newly formed stars ionizes the medium and ... these bubbles of ionized regions grow and merge until the entire universe is ionized again (and is therefore transparent).     Have I misunderstood when the universe is transparent? Or the definition of transparent? Would it be accurate to say that the present day universe is completely ionized? (Does this just mean that most matter is in the form of stars which can be considered ionized? Since it doesn't really seem immediately evident in everyday life that ""everything is ionized"") "
2923,How easy would be to see the Moon from Mars?,"This question arises from ""What planet is better than earth to infer solar system configuration?"", where one of the answers pointed that it's easier to discover the Moon from Mars than discovering the Galilean satellites of Jupiter from Earth.  Then my question is:   How easy (or difficult) would be to see the Moon from Mars? Could it be seen with naked eye? Is actually easier to see the Moon from Mars than to see the Galilean moons of Jupiter from Earth?   I know there are favourable factors (Mars is closer to Earth than Earth to Jupiter, and Earth is smaller than Jupiter, so it's expected to obscure less its moon than Jupiter obscures its) and also unfavourable factors (the Moon is closer to the Earth than the Galilean moons to Jupiter, and Earth and Moon are backlit when seen from Mars). What is the overall result? "
2924,Energy needed to create a black hole vs energy needed to run the Large Hadron Collider?,"I was disappointed to hear Brian Cox's flippant reply to whether or not the LHC could create a black hole big enough to swallow the earth in this video:  [website]I'm guessing that the power used by the LHC is nothing like that used when gravity crushes a star to a singularity, but ...  ... how big is ""nothing like""?

2925,Does the loss of mass create an observable change in a comet's orbit?,"Comets lose their mass through water evaporation due to close encounter with sun, so my question is does the loss of mass create an observable change in a comet's orbit? What kind of change that may be shrinking orbit or expanding orbit? "
2926,Dynamical modelling of galaxies with counter-rotating components using the Schwarzschild method,"I am currently trying to understand dynamical modelling using Schwarzschild's method. I have been doing some reading the past days, but I suspect that I am getting something really wrong. According to my current understanding, the Schwarzschild method for dynamical modelling using spatially-resolved kinematic data works like this:   Fit one or more 2D profiles (e.g., Gaussian) to the image or zeroth moment of the observation. De-project the above fitted model to 3D space and create a 3D luminosity distribution. Convert the 3D luminosity distribution to mass using a bunch of mass particles. Create a series of possible orbits for the above mass particles and calculate the resulting velocity vectors. From the above velocity vectors create velocity and velocity dispersion maps and calculate the chi-squared between them and the observed velocity and velocity dispersion maps.    The last step is what troubles me. To my understanding, the orbits of the particles in a Schwarzschild model can be counter-rotating. Right? In a galaxy observation, when we have two collisionless components (e.g., stellar components) that counter-rotate, it is possible that we will observe double-peaked spectral lines. Right? This information is impossible to be stored using a velocity and a velocity dispersion map, but it can be stored in a spectral cube. Yet, all papers on dynamical modelling using the Schwarzschild method fit models to velocity and velocity dispersion maps instead of a spectral cube.  So, from the above I have concluded that my understanding of the Schwarzschild method is not correct. I would really appreciate if someone could help me to understand what I am getting wrong.   Thank you in advance. "
2927,Telescopes for beginner astrophotography,"I'm a fairly experienced photographer and have enjoyed taking lots of photos of the night sky with my existing gear - wide angle starscapes over pretty hills, mostly.   I'd like to move on, having seen what's possible with telescopes and mounted cameras. I've read around, and am now confused....  The plan sees me getting a telescope, tripod and mount of some sort (equatorial I believe I need?), and periodically putting that carefully into my car, driving into a rural area with dark skies and clear horizons, and pointing it at interesting things - my urban gardenless flat really isn't a good location for this.  I have Nikon full and crop frame and Olympus m4/3 cameras available - I believe I'd need a T mount adaptor to fit them? Is one likely to be hugely better than the other for this in a way I've not foreseen? I know the Nikon has much better low light performance but the Olympus puts more pixels on the subject with its small chip and has the very useful live time mode. I'm used to raw processing, but I'm expecting there'll be more specialist software I'll need to learn.   Am I anywhere near right or is this all mad?   What sort of things do I need to watch for on telescopes? Am I going to trash a telescope by moving it around like this? I'm used to moving big lenses which I'm hoping is tolerably similar (accepting the very different optical designs)? What have I completely missed?   "

2929,how did James Bradley discover light aberration?,"I do not understand his timing method. James  The magnitude of the aberration could be v/c?   The speed of earth is about 30km/s.  That means the deviation from the real position of a star is about 30/300000 rad =180*3600/3.14159/10000 ~20arcsecond.  That is a horrible value.  Could the effect of parallex, proper motion and light aberration of a star be separated clearly?  －－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－  Sure. Aberration is always the same. Parallax depends on the distance, and the phase is different.  Why is their phase different? They all have a one year period.  Generally we should not worry about the light aberration, right? Even space telescopes have reference stars. The position of the reference stars are fixed. So although there are detectable wobble(20"") in one year , because we use reference stars, this kind of effect is removed every day immediately. Every night, when the night assistant lets a telescope point at some direction, he has to use reference stars to calibrate that night's pointing.   Am I right?  "
2930,What are Flamsteed numbers?,Can you tell me about Flamsteed numbers? I just know that it is a specific number used for identification of stars. But what is the theory behind it? In what way is the number given to stars? 
2931,Dfferent distances to comet 67P,"Earlier, I was looking for the current distance from Earth to 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko, in order to do a ""back of envelope"" calculation of signal delay. Not important, but I was somewhat puzzled to find quite a large discrepancy between values reported by different sites, and would love to understand why.  ESA's Where is Rosetta page currently gives the distance as around 719m km, which, if I'm using it correctly, is backed up by JPL Horizons tool, which gives me a delta of around 4.81 AU. Which is great.  But when I look at The Sky Live's 67P live tracker, it is reporting around 941m km, which their comet info page gives as around 6.3 AU. Am I missing something blindingly obvious? "

I already know how to obtain [tex] and [tex]  They are given by the following:  [tex]  Where [tex] and is just the normalization. The real component is [tex] and the imaginary component is [tex]  I am wondering how to obtain the half-light radius, as well.

2933,Is the Milankovitch calendar provably better than the Gregorian one considering a non-constant tropical year?,"It's somewhat of a no-brainer the revised Julian calendar (attibuted to Milankovitch) is more accurate than the Gregorian one just because it started with a more accurate estimate of the duration of the tropical year. From (the English translation) of Milankovitch's 1923 paper:     A complete adoption of the Gregorian calendar was, however, not advisable either from a religious or scientific standpoint because the astronomical data concerning the length of the tropical year which lay at the base of the Gregorian reform are now replaced by others.   In fact one (unpublished?) paper by Lichtenberg and Richter (1998) explains the difference between the two calendars as a better continued fraction approximation of the number 0.781 = (36 525 − 36 524.219), i.e. the of difference between the Julian year and the tropical year (as approximately measured more recently), with the Gregorian rational approximation of that 0.781 being 3/4 and the Milankovitch one being 7/9. (It's actually a bit more complicated as there's a second parameter to approximate, but I don't care to elaborate on the other one here.)  But what I want to ask: is this superiority of the Milankovitch calendar still true considering (more realistic) models in which the tropical year is not constant? I actually break this down into two sub-questions...  I could easily find a comparison (Moyer, 1982) of the Julian and Gregorian calendars using the Newcomb model for the tropical year:    What would the Milankovitch calendar look like on that graph? (Or e.g. using a more sophisticated cubic model of the tropical year, what would they look like).  And further, considering what we don't know about the uncertainties of the tropical year, e.g. according to Wikipedia:     If society in the future still attaches importance to the synchronization between the civil calendar and the seasons, another reform of the calendar will eventually be necessary. According to Blackburn and Holford-Strevens (who used Newcomb's value for the tropical year) if the tropical year remained at its 1900 value of 365.24219878125 days the Gregorian calendar would be 3 days, 17 min, 33 s behind the Sun after 10,000 years. Aggravating this error, the length of the tropical year (measured in Terrestrial Time) is decreasing at a rate of approximately 0.53 s per century. Also, the mean solar day is getting longer at a rate of about 1.5 ms per century. These effects will cause the calendar to be nearly a day behind in 3200. The number of solar days in a ""tropical millennium"" is decreasing by about 0.06 per millennium (neglecting the oscillatory changes in the real length of the tropical year).[3] This means there should be fewer and fewer leap days as time goes on. A possible reform would be to omit the leap day in 3200, keep 3600 and 4000 as leap years, and thereafter make all centennial years common except 4500, 5000, 5500, 6000, etc. But the quantity ΔT is not sufficiently predictable to form more precise proposals (Blackburn &amp; Holford-Strevens 2003, p. 692).   Is the error with which we can estimate the duration of future tropical years greater than the difference between the Milankovitch and Gregorian calendars? The year 2800 is leap in Gregorian but not in Milankovitch's calendar. That's ""pretty close"" to the suggestion in the last quote to make 3200 not leap, which suggests that the difference between the two calendars is greater than the error currently incurred in estimating tropical year duration. So it looks like one could still answer the question whether Milankovitch's calendar is provably better than the (unmodified) Gregorian one even considering estimation errors for the tropical year duration. Is that a correct assessment though?  In contrast to that model cited in Wikipedia, Borkowski (1991) (using a quadratic model for the tropical year, which he finds is a good approximation of the VSOP92 cubic model for the next 4000 years) concludes that      our Gregorian calendar will not deviate from the exact solar calendar by significantly more than 1 day for some 2000 years to come.   So it looks like that would make the year 2800 (non-leap in Milankovitch's) a rather premature correction...  Moyer also contains this passage:     In 1582 the   length of the tropical year was nearly   365.24222 days, which differed from the   Gregorian year by only a little more   than 24 seconds. If the length of the year   itself were not gradually diminishing,   the calendar under the plan devised by   Lilius would retain the date of the vernal   equinox at or about March 21 for   more than 3,550 years.      Clavius himself estimated that the   calendar would deviate by one day in   the year 5084. Considering the decline   in the length of the year, which was quite   unknown to 16th-century astronomers,   the calendar will remain accurate to   within one mean solar day for a much   shorter time, some 2,417 years, or until   about the year 4317. (Extrapolations are   based on the determination of the tropical   year at epoch 1900 by the American   astronomer Simon Newcomb; his figure   was 365.24219879 mean solar days.)   Which again is concluding (using the linear model of Newcomb) that Gregorian  calendar is better than  Milankovitch claims. "
2934,"How does this telescope work, and what is it for?","Procrastinating, I clicked on a suggested video (How Large Can a Telescope Be?) and after about 01:20 I saw a clip of a telescope shown below.  I was confused as I saw the reflections in the mirror until I decided that there are actually two small objects in front of the primary mirror, one far from the primary where you'd expect to see a secondary, which I've labeled ""A"", and one very close to the primary, which I have labeled ""B"".   Both are supported by four vanes, and there does not seem to be a hole in the primary.   I've labeled the reflected image of the back side of B as B' (B prime), and I've indicated the reflections of an ""A vane"" and a ""B vane"" with arrows.    But ""A"" looks very small compared to what I'd expect, only perhaps a few percent of the primary's diameter, and it looks like the telescope is not in a conventional dome, but perhaps has only a sliding or otherwise openable roof (currently off screen) to protect it when not in use.  Question: How does this telescope work, and what is it for? Is it for imaging, or performing some other function?    [website]"
2935,Are multiple geostationary satellites required to handle arbitrary locations?,"Do geostationary satellites need to have the equator as the plane of rotation, and the earth's centre to be the centre of rotation? Can it rotate over, say, the Tropic of Cancer, focusing on a single city?  If not, in which case, we need a chain of geostationary satellites to do a function, why employ geostat satellites at all? Aren't there satellites at lower altitudes which could do a better job? "
2936,"Landing on an ""earth-like"" planet (practical application)","This may not belong here in astronomy and my apologies if that's the case. The hypothetical: We find, and are able to travel to (in a reasonably short amount of time), a planet that is for all intents and purposes a second earth: it has close to the same atmosphere, gravitational force, a stable orbit, land and liquid water, preferable temperatures, vegetation and other life , etc...    From a 'War of the Worlds' approach to this, wouldn't it stand to reason that we still would not be able to land on the planet and exit our spacecraft without suits to protect us because of the fundamental aspect of our immune systems? That is, our bodies have adapted and continue to adapt to Earth's lifeforms but have absolutely no tolerance to another planet of almost identical properties and therefore would perish shortly after exposure, yes? So I wonder, does anyone know if there is a plan for the hypothetical scenario to gradually expose individuals to the new environment and if so, what is the plan? For example, we could try to collect at least some of the potentially hazardous bacteria and viruses for vaccination? (maybe, not sure how that works even on Earth) "
2937,"Can Mercury's core ""boil over"" if it gets to close to the Sun?","I was reading about how Mercury's core makes up most of the volume of the planet. I'm guessing this is both because of the small size and the distance to the Sun. If Mercury got too hot could it completely ""liquidify""? Would it join the Sun and completely merge with it, gradually crack apart and spread, or something else entirely? Would it cause other problems in terms of life on Earth?  "
2938,"Hot and ""warm"" Jupiters expelling terrestrial planets?","I've seen in documentaries that if a Jupiter size planet migrates close to its star then it would remove terrestrial planets along the way. This makes sense and I'm sure most models would predict this, but do we have evidence?  Indeed, the Kepler survey (taking Kepler 1-447) found 34 Planets>6 R(Earth) less than 0.1 AU from the star and the only one where another planet was found was Kepler 424 which also has a Jupiter size planet at 0.73 AU. Three ""warm"" Jupiters (0.1- 1.7AU) out of 47 have earth-size planets discovered in same system and all are ""mini-solar systems"" with the smaller planets far interior. (K68,90 and 407). If you include ""super-earths"" (R = 1.25-2.0 R(Earth)), then there are 7 additional stars found with ""warm Jupiters"" in multiple systems. The super-earths are still all inside the Jupiter's (although K18,89 and 118 have Jupiters less than 0.2 AU).     My question is:      Is this finding proof that migrating Jupiters have thrown out   terrestrial planets or do their existence make the signals of   ""exterior"" planets hard to discern? And what about smaller planets   migrating in ""behind"" the Jupiter's?  "
2939,Sudden Effects of Sun Disappearing,"It takes 8 minutes for the sun's light to reach earth. If the sun were to instantly disappear, what would happen?

2940,Difference between quasar and Active Galactic Nuclei?,"Are there any differences between quasars and Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN)?  As I understand it, they are both caused by extremely luminous electromagnetic emission from material accreting onto a super-massive black hole.  If they have the same source, is there still some fundamental difference between them (and if so what is it) or are they two names for the same thing? "
2941,Could a habitable satellite of a gas giant have a stable subsatellite?,"I have set a science fiction story on a moon, orbiting a gas giant (which orbits its star at approximately the same orbit as the Earth around the Sun), and given this moon its own satellites.  The moon is Earth-sized, and the moon’s satellites are on the order of a large asteroid each (perhaps up to half the size of the Moon … Luna if there was any confusion with the number of times I said ‘moon’ in this post.)  I am a computer nerd, not an astronomer, so I’m wondering if this is something that is at least possible?  Could the orbits of the gas giant around the star, the moon around the gas giant, and the subsatellites around the moon remain stable for the requisite billion or so years for life to develop on the moon?  Could the moon be habitable? "
2942,Do we expect life to develop only in certain regions of the galaxy?,"If I understand correctly, the Earth lies in an area of the galaxy - the ""local bubble"" - that is relatively free of dust and gases and where no new stars are being born.  What is the current theory on the relation between life on Earth and this location? Or in other words: Would we expect life to exist anywhere in the galaxy, e.g. also inside some nebula, or only in specific areas, and how are they characterised? "
2943,What's a good model for the vernal equinox year? Can it increase forever?,"Duncan Steel (2002) makes an interesting argument that the notion of year is (1) somewhat arbitrary and, more interestingly (2) one notion of year can increase while another decreases.  His examples are tropical year (which decreases over time, at least in the linear Newcomb model) and the vernal equinox year which seems to be currently increasing.  Actually looking at the data that his point is based on, namely Meeus and Savoie (1992), we can find another measure that is decreasing, namely the solstice year(s), either June or December; the autumnal equinox year is also decreasing:    Steel actually uses the fact that the  vernal equinox year is increasing as an argument that the Gregorian calendar is ""getting better"" in a sense that it's closer to hitting its target year length. (The opposite is the case if one consider say either of the solstice years... or the tropical year, which is the point that a lot of other people make, e.g. Moyer (1982).)  What I really want to ask here: assuming a simple linear decrease model for the tropical year (e.g. Newcomb), will the trends of the equinox and solstice years reverse at some point in the future?  (And if it's not too much extra to ask:) What are the implications of the more complex models for the tropical year (e.g. cubic VSOP) on the evolution of the equinox and solstice years? "
2944,Why are explosions always used to represent the Big Bang?,"In documentaries the Big Bang is often represented as blackness followed by a big explosion with loud noises. This always feels cheap and falling short of explaining the origin of the Universe. Is this really the best way to get green-thumbs thinking about the origin of the Universe? Are there other, better, representations or analogies of the Big Bang? If so, how do they better describe the current cosmological model than the ""explosion"" analogy? "
2945,Solar and lunar eclipses -- how rare,"I was fortunate enough to see the solar eclipse in southern Illinois last year. The clouds were not friendly, but we did have one spectacular moment of perfect eclipse. It is an eerie sensation, and I cannot imagine how utterly terrifying it must have been for our ancient ancestors to see the moon eating the Sun.  However, it got me wondering. A solar eclipse can occur in the spectacular fashion it does because the angular dimension on the moon and the Sun are almost exactly the same -- this despite the fact that they are dramatically different in actual dimension. This seems a remarkable coincidence to me -- the ratio of the distances being almost exactly the same as the ratio of their diameters.   I was wondering if there are any other known examples of such a phenomenon occurring anywhere else in the universe? Can we make any estimate of how often something like that might occur in a galaxy? "
2946,"Universe is expanding, why doesn't time expand with it?","Reading this response When the universe expands does it create new space, matter, or something else? I understand Universe is not expanding like if it is stretching its space, but it is actually adding space that matter can travel through.  So, if the Universe can create more space, and space and time are related, shouldn't that mean Universe is creating also more time? And if it is the case, shouldn't this effect alter results of our measurements about how much time light spends to reach us from distant stars?  We know that photons have no mass, travel at speed of light, and time has no sense for them. But at the same time they are influenced in their trajectories by folds in the space-time.  If gravity deforms space-time, shouldn't an expanding Universe adding new space doing the same? "

2948,Accuracy of predicting an asteroid strike in 1987,"Good People,  I am writing a short story, and I wanted to include a section wherein a family is told that an asteroid is going to strike their home. The thing is, I would like to set the story in 1987, but I'm not sure if there was the capability of that kind of prediction back then. To be honest, I'm not even sure that kind of accuracy is possible now! But I will allow myself some creative freedom in that area, but I don't want to stretch it so much that someone would keep thinking to themselves, ""Really, in 1987 they could predict that?"" Would such a thing have been possible then? If not then, what about sometime in the 90s?  While I have your eyes, is there a specific size that an asteroid would have to be in order to just destroy one home (or a couple on the side of the home).  Thank you for any insight and info! I appreciate the resources here. I did some digging around before asking this question: nothing seemed to be particular to my frame of reference. If it exists, please let me know. "
2949,What does less than one count from an x-ray detector mean? (Swift BAT detector),I'm reading a paper about a recent x-ray burst from a suspected magnetar (A.

The value of count rate for the peak of the burst from the graph is [tex] over a timespan of less than [tex]. This corresponds to about [tex] for that time period. What does this mean?

2950,Neutron star r-process nucleosynthesis,"The [tex]-process in supernovae happens when a high flux of neutrons irradiates the heaviest abundant nuclei (in the region of iron), resulting in endothermic nuclear reactions.  To the extent that at least some of the highest [tex]-process elements are now thought to be synthesised in neutron star mergers, is the mechanism the same: that is, is it a question of  the (hypothesised) iron crust of the neutron stars being irradiated by a sudden intense flux of neutrons at the moment of the merger? Or is it that the ""splashed"" neutronium resolves itself into a range of atomic nuclei, especially the heavier [tex]-process ones?  I appreciate that this is a question about hypothesis built upon hypothesis, but it would be interesting to get some idea of current thinking.   EDIT (from a comment): This Stack Exchange answer suggests that splashed neutronium will end up as the lightest elements, but tantalisingly raises another interesting question: whether the [tex]-process elements are created in the merger or whether they are constantly present at the bottom of the crust, in some sort of equilibrium between the infinite supply of neutrons within the star and the iron in the crust itself. In which case the merger would create nothing, merely liberate what is already there. "

What sort of stuff could we learn from such an event, both about supernovae and neutrinos? In particular, what are the prospects for estimating the neutrino mass?  "

2954,Are there recent estimates of Kuiper belt mass?,"What is the mass of the Kuiper belt? Obviously estimates will be highly uncertain, but for my application I would like to find a decent current estimate.  The papers I found so far: (Gladman et al. 2001) estimates it to 0.1 Earth-masses, (Trujillo, Lewitt &amp; Luu 2001) gets the mass of bodies between 100 km and 2000 km to 0.03 Earth-masses, (Kenyon &amp; Bromley 2004) estimate on the order of 0.5 Earth-masses (assuming a starting mass of 10 and then losing 95%), (Fraser et al 2014) estimate just [tex]0.01 Earth-masses.   These papers are a bit old, and I suspect there have been more recent observations improving on the estimates. There is a fair number of papers discussing how to resolve this discrepancy between disk models predicting 10-30 Earth-masses and these low numbers, but I am more interested in empirical estimates.   So, what is the current consensus on the Kuiper belt mass and its uncertainty? "

I know x, y, z coordinates of the galaxies in both redshifts 0 and 1, however there is no way for me to identify a single galaxy in both redshifts, i.e., there is no tracker/tracer for the galaxies that will trace the position of galaxies from redshift 1 to 0.  Now I have halo catalogue for both [tex] and [tex] and I am interested to trace a certain galaxy from z=0 to 1. I know that galaxy's exact x,y,z at [tex]. My initial plan is to create a search with [tex] in kpc. So any galaxy at redshift 1 with coordinates less than r maybe a potential candidate.   My question is, is there any intelligible guess of what a potential value of r would be in kpc? In other words, I am interested to know with reduced Hubble parameter [tex], how much far a galaxy might move from [tex] to [tex]? "

I've found a few references for converting right ascension and declination to local azimuth and altitude; so far, so good, now I need to plot that coordinate in 2D.  It's trivial to turn az/alt into an azimuthal equidistant projection; just map azimuth to [tex] and altitude to [tex] where +90° is zero and -90° is 2.  However, what I really want is an azimuthal equidistant projection where the center is at a point of my choosing — for example, NW toward the horizon — ideally specified using two angles, [tex] and [tex].  With no modifications, az/alt is using a focal point directly overhead — how do I rotate that to my point?  (Continuing the example, I'd be rotating by [tex] 45°, [tex] 90°.)  I believe this is a spherical trigonometry question, but I'm having trouble grokking the references I've found well enough to do what I want.  Any guidance? "
2961,Why the torque exerted by the moon upon the Earth makes the Moon to increase his orbit?,"For what I know, this torque exists because of the misalignment of the tidal bulge with the apsidal line Earth-Moon a certain angle [tex], which makes the earth rotation to slow down a bit. But, how that pulls away the moon? I thought this ""loss"" of rotational momentum transferred into tidal heating. I fail to see how this energy is transferred into more orbital momentum, because I thought the conservation of angular momentum didn't have to do with the rotation of the objects. I mean, isn't true that [tex] remains constant in the two-body problem (being [tex])? How the rotation plays into that? "
2962,How much magnetic attraction is there between the Sun and Earth?,How much magnetism is there between the Earth and Sun? Would the distance from the Sun differ for not the Earth iron core and how much? 
2963,How much mass do the volcanoes of Io erupt past escape velocity?,"While trying to do some calculations to answer this quesion, I got stuck missing a crucial piece of data: I have no clue how much mass the volcanoes of Io manage to throw out of the gravity well of the Jupiter moon.  It is clear that most of the erupted material falls back to the surface, and the various velocity estimates I have found are quite a bit lower than the escape velocity (~2.56 km/s). For instance ""up to 1 km/s"".  One number that is possible to find is how much mass the magnetosphere of Jupiter strips of Io. Most are listing that as 1000kg/s (example). That is about as much as the wheat production of Canada.  Are the volcanoes directly throwing away a lot more than that? A lot less? Not at all? "
2964,Eyepiece diameter for small focal length planetary viewing on a large dobsonian?,"I have a 12"" dobsonian with a 1500mm focal length and want to do some higher magnification planetary viewing. Currently my highest magnification is ~80x via my 19mm eyepiece (calculated here), but I would like to do some viewing at higher magnification.  My telescope is fitted for 2"" diameter eyepieces, but I have an adapter for  1¼"" eyepieces as well. I'm seeing a plethora of affordable 1¼-inch 9mm eyepieces, but very few 2"" diameter options and very pricey at that.  At this point, I see the following options, by increasing price:   1¼"" diameter 9mm eyepiece 3x Barlow lens 2"" diameter 9mm eyepiece   I've read that the 2"" eyepieces yield greater field of view advantages. Is that still true when the goal is a narrow focal length on solar system objects?  Would using a Barlow lens on my existing 2"" eyepieces retain this advantage in a meaningful way?  In summary, is there any significant value in keeping to the 2"" diameter eyepiece capability of my telescope when doing planetary viewing with low focal length given the magnitude of the cost difference?  I've referenced a ""9mm"" eyepiece here merely as an example, I'm sure most anything in the 5mm-12mm range would be fine. "
2965,Can a tectonically inactive planet retain a long-term atmosphere?,"Can a planet be tectonically inactive and still retain a magnetosphere and protected atmosphere? How does that work?  How else could a planet retain a thick atmosphere like Earth's for extensive periods of time?   Note, I'm not asking on Earth science SE as, well, the question is not about Earth. I was hoping there was some sort of astronomical theory for other potential habitable planets. "
2966,Is the longitude assigned to sunspots spherical or projected?,"Sunspot maps are created from a projection of the sun, so the coordinates of sunspots (or active regions in general) are assigned according to it.   Do these coordinates correspond to actual spherical positions, or are they altered as a result of the projection?   Edit: After seeing the answer, I realized that a part of what I am asking about was not clear in the initial question. So here it is: Are the values of the sunspot coordinates as provided officially in spherical positions or in projection?   A commonly used instance of ""official"" records is X-ray measurements from the NOAA GOES. The text files are found here.   For example, see file for 2000. The output is documented here, under ""Output File Specification"".  "
2967,What would you find within a void?,"I'm aware that voids are relatively empty regions of the universe, but just how empty can they be? Wikipedia states that voids have 'few or no' galaxies, but I can't find much else.  To make my question specific, suppose I were in the centre of a large void, way outside of the few galaxies that may still exist in this void. Would I occasionally encounter asteroids (if I may call them such), rogue planets, or even some occasional intergalactic star?  Remark: I'm aware that this question is a bit of a one-up of What is there in the intergalactic space?. If this is too much of a duplicate, let me know and I remove the question. "
2968,In what parts of the world is it impossible to view the night sky due to light pollution?,"Growing up far from any city, I have always been able to view the full night sky. It was just the way how things were. Of course, I knew that light pollution is a thing, and that the sky is a lot less clear if you live in a city.  It just never occurred to how bad it was before talking with people who had experienced it.  Apparently:   Inside a city, it is pretty much impossible to view anything. It is not a lot better just outside a city, the sky is still mostly empty. Most of Europe, parts of the US, India, and eastern Asia is so polluted with light that you can not see the Milky way.   Does anyone have a map showing the affected area? How many people have never seen our own galaxy? "
2969,Existence of wormholes and exotic matter,"Is it really possible for bending of space time to travel to another distant place in universe. Wormhole has two mouths which one is a black hole and another is a white hole which could let us out. Which is commonly called as Einstein-Rosen bridge, is there any pictorial proof of wormholes other than the theoretical proof by Einstein. Is there a possibility of having exotic matter which helps the wormhole to keep open up always?? "
2970,"V471 Tauri's circumbinary brown dwarf non-observation; Applegate, or over-restrictive assumptions?","tl;dr Has the brown dwarf observation been disproven?  I have just started reading about the interesting object V471 Tauri. The first two sentences of the introduction to The V471 Tauri System: A Multi-datatype Probe Vaccaro et al. (2015):     V471 Tau, a white dwarf-red dwarf eclipsing binary (EB) in the Hyades with orbit period [tex], is primarily known for its unique historical role as a stimulus to common envelope evolution theory (Chau et al. 1974; Refsdal 1974; Sparks &amp; Stecher 1974; Ostriker 1976; Paczynski 1976; Alexander et al. 1976; Taam et al. 1978). Other properties include a likely brown dwarf companion to the EB, measured white dwarf spin, mass loss and exchange in a detached binary, differential rotation measured via magnetic spots, spot distributions, accurate white dwarf parameters, and photometric-spectroscopic distance measures that help to pin down the binary’s location within the Hyades.   It's the ""likely brown dwarf companion"" I'd like to ask about. The paper with the catchy title ""The First Science Results from SPHERE: Disproving the Predicted Brown Dwarf around V471 Tau"" Hardy et al. (2015) SPHERE is a new, advanced adaptive optics system at the Very Large Telescope (VLT). The image below (figure 3) is part of the argument, and the suggestion is that if there is no brown dwarf seen in the band between the two white circles, then the predicted brown dwarf does not exist.  This would be interesting, because an alternative explanation for the slow, periodic drift in the eclipse timing would have to be found. One possibility is the Applegate Mechanism which I don't understand, but may ask a separate question after this.  Back to Vaccaro 2015, section 9, titled ""On the Reality of the Third Star"" is over six pages of discussion of the underlying assumptions, and if I understand it correctly provides several possible ways in which a suitable brown dwarf could exist but not show up in the SPHERE image. In essence disproving the existence disproof.  I would like to know: Is my understanding of the current situation correct? Have there been more recent developments?     above: Left panel of Fig. 3 of Hardy et al. 2015: ""Figure 3. H-band image of V471 Tau obtained on the SPHERE IRDIS instrument at the VLT.

2971,What if there was an asteroid belt with the mass of a planet?,"In the past, the asteroid belt was thought to be the remains of a shattered planet. Of course, that was all pseudoscience, the mass of the asteroid belt being 4% of the moon. I've been wondering, what would happen if this did occur. What would an asteroid belt with around 50% of the Earth's mass be like? How often would asteroids hit earth? Would it influence Mars? "
2972,What percentage of the celestial sphere can the Moon cover?,"I was solving a task that said (paraphrasing):     What percentage of the night sky can the Moon cover during the entire   year, when observed from all points on Earth (what percentage of the   night sky can be studied with the occultation method)?    This is a task I read from a book, and the solution states that the Moon covers a ""ribbon"" of width [tex] where [tex] angular diameter of the Moon + 2*the Moon's daily parallax + 2*the inclination of the Moon's orbit to the ecliptic; and length [tex]. Why is this like this, I understand the diameter and parallax part, but I couldn't visualize the problem very well. Why is the third number the inclination to the ecliptic and not to the equator? "
2973,Exactly what in Saturn has been located to within 4 km precision?,"Saturn has been located with fantastic precision thanks to Cassini and VLBI. The location of the 120,000 km diameter giant planet (when defining the 1 bar pressure level as its surface) is known to within 4 kilometers. This has already been helpful in the (preliminary) discovery and characterization of ""planet nine"".  I suppose it is the Saturn system's barycenter which has been located gravitationally. At this level of precision I suppose that the moons', especially Titan's tidal effects must be considered. But also Saturn's flattened shape and maybe even weather systems. Saturn is known to be lumpy inside, this has been discovered by the effects it has on the inner rings. Such lumps have similar effects as a moon, so I wonder if these too are being considered at the 4 km precision level, and overall exactly how the point located is defined? "
2974,What could be past the particle horizon?,"Forgive any kind of ""dumb"" question I may ask as this is a new interest of mine and I know it's purely hypothetical.   If one were able to surpass light speed and the expansion of space to go beyond the particle horizon, what could be out there? Could it just be an empty void? Could it loop around to the other side of the particle horizon? I'd love to read about any kind of theories or research done on this subject. "
2975,Did the Juno mission locate Jupiter at the same precision as Saturn (4 km)?,Juno's low perijove should be great for measuring Jupiter's gravitational effect on Juno's orbit. Cassini together with VLBI has measured Saturn's location to within 4 km.   Will Was Juno be able to be measured by VLBI to determine Jupiter's location and orbit at a similar precision? At a precision useful for mapping the Solar System outside of the Kuiper Belt? 
2976,What's the time in which the sun rises?,"What's the time the sun takes in order to rise? (The time in which the solar disk crosses the horizon) How does this time depend on local latitude and the sun's declination? Assume that we're at sea level, and we ignore refraction and other atmospheric processes. (solar disk's altitude approximated with 0) "
2977,Do black holes produce thermal radiation?,"Do black holes produce thermal radiation, as expected on theoretical grounds? Does this radiation contain information about their inner structure, as suggested by gauge–gravity duality, or not, as implied by Hawking's original calculation? If not, and black holes can evaporate away, what happens to the information stored in them (since quantum mechanics does not provide for the destruction of information)? Or does the radiation stop at some point leaving black hole remnants? Is there another way to probe their internal structure somehow, if such a structure even exists? "
2978,Are horizontal branch stars fully convective?,"I know that RR Lyrae stars are convective (this is suspected to be part of the cause of the Blazhko effect), but I would like to know more generally:   Are RR Lyrae fully convective? Are all HB stars convective, and fully convective?   The detailed articles I've found so far to try to answer this question are all quite focused on RR Lyrae variables and so don't readily provide the answers to these questions as far as I've seen. "
2979,When the moon eclipses the sun what direction is darkened first: left or right?,"I saw the question and answer for the explanation of the direction of the moon's eclipse from left to right, but what about the direction of the moon as it passes over or between Earth and the sun?  Does the moon always pass from the right to the left or from the left to the right as it covers the sun; if you live above the equator?  Or does this change? Can it change? August 2017 the USA will have a total eclipse of the sun for the first time in decades. "
2980,Does the age of the universe take into account General Relativity / Special Relativity?,"It is generally accepted that the age of the universe is approximately 12-15 billion years old based on the speed of the expansion of the universe. Since everything is moving very fast away from us, doesn't relativistic effects from high speeds come into play here? If something is moving quite fast, time slows down, affecting how ""old"" it is. Is all this taken into account when calculating the age of the universe? I don't know if I'm making any sense to anyone else or not.  "
2981,Did Gaia actually generate complete light curves for 212 Cepheids in other galaxies?,"The recent BBC news item Gaia clocks speedy cosmic expansion says that a recent Gaia measurement of 212 Cepheid variables in other galaxies within the local group yields a Hubble constant of ~73 km/s/Mpc which is in agreement with a previous measurement using the Hubble telescope.  The results are reported in: A test of Gaia Data Release 1 parallaxes: implications for the local distance scale. I have included Figure 1 at the end here. If I understand correctly, the x-axis or ""Photometric Parallax"" represents photometric data which is compared to a model to yield a distance, which is then expressed as an equivalent parallax.   Gaia is not a ""point and shoot"" instrument like the Hubble telescope. It has a slow, extremely steady rotation in order to scan at least 1.5 full revolutions - enough for every start in the scan to pass completely across the CCD array through both telescopes.  But this isn't an optimal observing plan for collecting data on a group of Cepheids. Although there are similarities, the light curves of different stars will be distinct. Am I naive to think that it is necessary to build up a nice, complete light curve with dense points in time in order to use the photometry for precision distance calculations? Was this actually done within Gaia's survey observing program, or was there a special observing plan for the Cepheid measurements?  The data also needs to be good enough to calculate the periods of each star with sufficient precision. The curve of absolute magnitude vs period is quite steep at low periods, meaning the error in the calculated distance is strongly affected by an error in the period.  And could someone help me understand - what is a TGAS parallax?    above: Figure 1 from here.      above X2: ""Figure 4 and 4a: Cepheid light curves (click on images for larger versions) Light curves for the twelve Cepheid variables in M100 that have been observed with Hubble.

2982,"is it possible to prove some version of the ""cosmic censorship hypothesis"" of Roger Penrose which proposes that this is impossible?","Can singularities not hidden behind an event horizon, known as ""naked singularities"", arise from realistic initial conditions, or is it possible to prove some version of the ""cosmic censorship hypothesis"" of Roger Penrose which proposes that this is impossible? Similarly, will the closed timelike curves which arise in some solutions to the equations of general relativity (and which imply the possibility of backwards time travel) be ruled out by a theory of quantum gravity which unites general relativity with quantum mechanics, as suggested by the ""chronology protection conjecture"" of Stephen Hawking? "
2983,"Is there, in fact, any close-up photography of Saturn's rings, showing individual pebbles/rocks?","After reading this excellent but difficult answer, [website]I've been thinking how difficult it is to get a sense of the distance between and the size of typical items of dust, pebbles, rocks and/or anything else in Saturn's rings.  In short, have any photographs been taken by spacecraft, more or less ""in"" the rings, close enough to actually see individual dust, pebbles and/or rocks?  (As I understand it, the rings are on the order of 10m thick.  So I'm asking, have any photos been taken from that order of distance from the rings?  What's simply the closest viewpoint ever taken?)  Failing that, is there perhaps an artist's rendition somewhere of ""what you'd see from 100m above the rings looking straight down at them?""  What would be in that frustrum - nothing?  Lots of fist-size rocks you could see? Or?  It's completely unclear to me if each (say) pebble-size piece is inches apart, meters apart, or for all I know 100s of km apart? "

Sextuple Star Systems = ??? Septuple Star Systems = ???   Also... Is there any way to get these percentages for systems that have primaries that are Giants (more than 2 Solar Masses) Major Stars (0.5 to 2 Solar Masses), and Minor Stars (0.5 Solar Masses... red dwarfs)  I have found an article that says...  Giant Stars = 80% have companions Major Stars = 50% have companions Minor Stars = 25% have companions  Sources: [website][website][website]"
2985,Does the Sun orbit the Milky way in a (kind of) flat or inclined orbit or more of a sine wave?,"I know it can't be a perfect ellipse or smooth orbit due to all the matter in every direction, and our Sun could be affected by a gravity assist of sorts if it passes close enough to another massive star. I also know that galaxy orbits are different than Solar System orbits because most of the mass is in the dark matter halo and as a result, the outer stars orbit faster than in a standard orbit, so there's a number of variables.  But, if we ignore gravity assists, is the sun mostly in a standard, or lightly inclined orbit around the center of the Milky way or more sinusoidal?  Reason I'm asking - see (attached and in my opinion, bad) article, and picture included.    I've seen pictures like this before that suggests that the Solar System moves in a kind of sine wave motion. I've seen estimates between 26 and 32 million years with the solar-system, rising above then below the plane of the Milky way with consistency (and perhaps, mass extinctions tied to this movement).     I can kind of see that happening, as the sun rises above it might have more gravitational pull below it drawing it back down and you kind of have a horizontal velocity to displacement cycle creating a sine wave in the orbit. That makes logical sense, but I'm wondering if that 26-32 million year sine wave type of movement is generally accepted or more somebody's imagination. Is anything definitive known about stars' orbits within galaxies? "
2986,Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) HDU `or_mask` - what does it mean exactly?,"I'm looking at the Sloan Digital Sky Survey data. I'm primarily using the flux data, from the documentation I see the first extend (HDU 1) has flux, loglam, ivar, and_mask, or_mask, etc.  There's been a lot of confusion here about what the or_mask is doing exactly, and the documentation hasn't been extremely clear.  My understanding so far is that the or_mask tells me when a particular pixel was flagged in one of many ways possible. I've understood from various random sources that this means the pixel is ""bad"" somehow. I haven't yet figured out how to know exactly ""why"" it is bad, my working assumption is that the possibilities are numerous, that there are many fields that have flags that might answer that question.  My primary question: Is every flux value with a non-zero or_mask inherently untrustworthy?  About 80% of pixels have a non-zero or_mask value, particularly on the bluer end of the spectrum.  Or is the or_mask telling me more broadly that there's a flag somewhere, not necessarily even with the flux data, that I might want to consider?

I was thinking red dwarf as per here Habitable Planet around Red Dwarf  To my understanding three questions arise:   Tidal lock Radiation Sunspots   Could a parent body (think small gas giant) be tidally locked and a moon then freely rotate? Could the magnetic field of a parent body protect a moon from a sun without the parent radiating too much?  I don't know what to say about sunspots though.  Then about the parent body itself:  Is the formation of the mini-neptune so close to a red dwarf impossible? Would its gravity wreck eveything?

What could it be and is size and speed estimation possible?","Between years 2009-2011, I was located in Greece, watching the perfectly dark night sky around 21:00-23:00 during summer, when I suddenly noticed a very dull dark-brown object that looked like a solid rock/potato having a perceived size around half the diameter of the moon in the sky, moving in a perfect straight line looking up   and perceived as fast (it took 3-4 seconds to disappear in the horizon) - so total exposure if I had seen it from start to end would have been less than 10-12 seconds.  One could barely notice it, it had some texture like a rock but blurry. It had almost no light reflection and it wasn't rotating or anything. It wasn't spherical and it was somewhat elongated along the axis of movement. I was barely able to detect it above me with naked eyes, as it was passing from left to right. I only did when I saw it was hiding a small region of the night sky stars. This way I perceived its irregular shape.  Unfortunately I cannot tell it's actual size or how fast it was going. Is it an object of a kind known to astronomers? I couldn't find any similar video footage or anyone seeing something similar talking in the internet. Could it be a space rock (asteroid?) that missed the earth atmosphere and at the same time be seen with naked eyes? Any estimates on space rock type, size and speed based on the time of sky exposure? Any astronomical id from a database or some guidance on how I could search it?  Could it be an asteroid occultation like this one: [website]Thanks  "

The galaxies are also moving away, so it makes it more difficult to figure out the elements producing the emission/absprtion lines, right?

2998,"Bright, brief light in sky this morning (daytime) - satellite flare?","This morning at 8:00am UK time, give or take about 3 minutes, I saw a very bright light in the sky which seemed to get a little brighter, lasting for maybe 5 seconds after I first noticed it, then faded out to nothing for a few seconds, then came back for another few seconds and disappeared entirely.  I was at around the following co-ordinates, and I was looking towards the South:  Lat: 51.980619 Long: -0.8443739614449441  I'd say it was at something like 30 degrees inclination but that's a really rough guess. It was somewhere around a third to half way between the horizon and overhead.  I know there are duplicate questions about this kind of thing BUT I believe this is different because:   I saw it during daylight. The sun was up, albeit behind clouds. The light was VERY bright, when I first saw it I thought it was Venus but then it obviously faded out. I think it was probably even brighter than Venus would have been. I have already ruled out Iridium flares by looking at Heavens Above. I have seen Iridium flares once or twice before and I think it looked similar.   Presumably there aren't too many objects in the sky that can get that bright. Are there any other objects which I could track apart from Iridium sats? Can anybody else find anything it might have been? "
2999,Brown Dwarf Cloud Models,There has been research that suggests that the changing brightness of Brown Dwarves are due to bands of Iron/Silicate clouds.

Calculus  Given the following besselian elements:   e20260812 = {     t0: 18.00, At: 72.3,     x0: 0.475510, x1: 0.518923, x2: -7.727e-05, x3: -8.039e-06,     y0: 0.771185, y1: -0.230167, y2: -1.246e-04, y3: 3.767e-06,     d0: 14.796683, d1: -0.012065, d2: -3.098e-06, d3: 0.0,     l10: 0.537974, l11: 0.000094, l12: -1.212e-05, l13: 0.0,     l20: -0.008142, l21: 0.000093, l22: -1.206e-05, l23: 0.0,     u0: 88.747810, u1: 15.003090, u2: 1.764e-06, u3: 0.0,     tanf1: 0.004614,  tanf2: 0.004591 }   (At represents [tex])  0 - Reference timestamp.

Once phi was calculated, we recalculate ro as follow to get a better approximation of phi and varpi (not yet calculated)  sin_phi = sin(phi * pi / 180.0) ro1 = sqrt( (1 - 2e^2 * sin_phi^2 + e^4 * sin_phi^2) / (1 - e^2 * sin_phi^2) )   Applying the updated ro (now ro1), we update sin_d and cos_d as follow:  sin_d1 = sin_d / ro1; cos_d1 = sqrt(1-e^2) * (cos_d / ro1)   And update zeta and cos_theta  zeta1 = sqrt(ro1^2 + x^2 + y^2) cos_theta1 = (-y * sin_d1 + zeta1 * cos_d1) / ro1   Finally we calculate vapri (the Longitud) as follows:  tan_theta = x / cos_theta1 theta = atan( tan_theta ) / Math.PI * 180.0 vapri = u - theta * ro1   and recalculate phi by doing:  cos_phi2 =  cos_theta1 / cos(theta / 180.0 * pi) phi1 = acos(cos_phi2) / pi * 180.0  phi = atan(tan(phi1 / 180.0 * pi) / sqrt(1 - e^2)) / pi * 180.0   At this point phi = 58.2795 , vapri = 21.7901 for 18:00 hs UTC (both values MUST be properly signed but I omitted that trivial part) a significant difference compared with the NASA prediction: 58.2683, 21.5733 (13 km or 8 mile)  My feeling is that ro1 in not good enough precise, so the final results get shifted, but I have no idea at all about how to getting unblocked.   I'm using 64 bit floating point calculator; It is ok for this kind of calculus?  Is this method good enough to get an error range near to 500m? if not, could you provide a method/fix to achieve that aim.   Any help would be appreciated. "
3002,When will the next series of mutual eclipses of Jupiter's moons begin?,"When I was young (I won't tell you when) I saw one of the four Galilean moons of Jupiter suddenly disappear while watching through a small refractor. It wasn't a coincidence, I'd seen the prediction in some announcements in Sky and Telescope and it happened like clockwork. The orbital plane of the Galilean moons had rotated so that it included the Sun, and the moons were Eclipsing each other, or so I remember.  Will this happen again? If so, when will they start, and where can I find predictions of individual eclipses? "
3003,Conversion of magnitudes to Jansky and MAGPHYS?,"I'm a bit puzzled and not an observer, so please bear with me if I'm being stupid here.   The code MAGPHYS specifies Jansky (Jy) as the input unit for flux through a filter (see Section 3.2.3 in the documentation). Meaning MAGPHYS wants me to use Jy as unit, when specify the total light of a whole galaxy in e.g. the SDSS-g band. But Jy is a unit of spectral density, i.e. W/m²/Hz. I would expect a flux as input unit when talking about the amont of light coming through a filter, i.e. in W/m² or in [tex] (solar luminosity), so integrated over all frequencies that go through the filter and weighted by the filter response function.  If I have the absolute AB magnitude of a galaxy in the SDSS-g band, how do I convert it to Jy so that MAGPHYS will be happy?  I'm aware of:  [tex]  But that is in one frequency, not a whole band.   Additionally, I have found the formula below in TOPCAT:  [tex]  Where does the 23 in the exponent come from? "
3004,Using emission lines to determine redshift of a quasar,"I am attempting this past paper question and am not sure how to tackle this, this is not homework! :)     The spectrum of a distant quasar shows two broad emission lines with observed   wavelengths of 317.7nm and 404.7nm. The strongest lines are most likely to be either Lyman-α with a rest wavelength 121.6nm, CIV with a rest wavelength of 154.9nm or MgII with a rest wavelength of 280.0nm.      (a) What is the redshift of the quasar? Please show your working.      (b) What two lines have been detected?      (c) The two lines have widths of 10nm and 20nm respectively. If I have measured   the mass of the black hole in the quasar to be 10^9Msun, how far from the centre of the quasar are the regions of ionised gas responsible for the emission lines?   Please specify any assumptions that you make to obtain your result.   I am assuming I must find z to be the ratio of the change in wavelength to the rest wavelength. However I'm unsure of how to identify these in the question. "
3005,Can Earth host another natural satellite than the Moon?,"Are there orbits with long-term stability (astronomical time scales) around Earth? Low altitude orbits will decay due to friction with Earth's atmosphere. Inside Earth's Roche limit, a Moon could not form anyway due tidal forces. At altitudes closer to that of the Moon, the Moon would presumably destabilize an orbit such that the object would either collide with Earth or the Moon or be ejected.   Many of the other planets in our solar system have multiple natural satellites; where this occurs, they are always vastly smaller than the primary - think of Jupiter, Saturn, and even Mars. On the other hand Earth, and apparently Pluto, each has only one natural satellite, relatively large in comparison to the primary. Is this because a large satellite will tend to clear the entire ""sphere of influence"" around its primary of any other material?  So my question is: does the existence of our Moon effectively prevent the formation or capture of any other natural satellite around Earth? (Considering only true satellites, not ""companion"" objects or quasi-satellites) "
3006,How small a star can provide Sun-level illumination to its planets?,"...or how small can a solar system be, to sustain an Earth-like planet?  Sun is not really small, and 1AU is pretty far when you look at orbital radii of exoplanets and size of their stars.  How small a star can be, to still provide Earth's equivalent of 1.36 kW/m2 above its own Roche Limit (of Earth-sized planet)? What would the star's diameter and the orbit providing such irradiance be in such a case?  I guess a Brown Dwarf wouldn't be enough to give that much within its Roche Limit, meaning any planet receiving enough light would be torn apart by tidal forces, and likely stepping up to smallest Main Sequence stars would step up the energy output enough that a planet at the Roche Limit would be scorched like Mercury, so its orbit would need to be considerably larger... but I don't quite know how to perform the needed calculations. "
3007,If two black hole event horizons overlap (touch) can they ever separate again?,"Hypothetical question based on my understanding that two event horizons that overlap (touch) can't ever separate again:  Imagine a 1 billion solar mass black hole (so the event horizon is massive and very gravitationally weak) is travelling at a velocity of 0.9c through empty flat intergalactic space; now imagine an identical 1 billion solar mass black hole travelling at 0.9c but in exactly the opposite direction so the two are heading roughly towards each other. The black holes' paths, once all the space time warping is taken into account, aren't on a direct collision but the outermost edges of the event horizons will just 'clip' each other, ordinarily only overlap for a fraction of a nanosecond as these two bodies are travelling at such incredibly fast velocities and in opposite directions to each other.  So firstly, am I right in thinking that if two event horizons overlap they can never 'unlap'?  Secondly, what would happen to this incredible amount of momentum of each other the black holes? Would it just get instantly turned into gravitational energy? Bearing in mind when black holes normally merge, it happens very slowly as black holes slowly move closer and closer together over millions of years giving off gravitational energy as that happens, so not in a fraction of a nanosecond as in this case.  And thirdly, what would this look like? Would the event horizons remain fairly spherical and the radiated energy just insane or would they stretch and warp into a kind of long thin elastic event horizon as they shoot past each other and then over time slow down and snap back to each other? "
3008,"Can any radio telescope be hooked up with the Very Long Baseline Array, or other interferometers?","The Very Long Baseline Array uses both Arecibo and Spectr-R, the world's largest space telescope with 10 m diameter at Lunar distance, as well as many other antennas. Are there any particular requirements on the design for a radio telescope to be used interferometrically? Could for example the now operating Chinese Five Hundred meter Spherical Telescope be used as a part of the VLBA? "
3009,evaluate solar eclipse Besselian elements?,"I found this NASA website which says that to predict eclipse, we should solve the Besselian elements ..what does this mean, how can I solve for Besselian elements? Is there a numerical method? I need to find the circumstance (length of eclipse etc) at a given coordinate..Sorry I am  very new to astronomy so my question might be basic..  "
3010,Are electrons and positrons equal in cosmic rays?,"I think the question here is not answered directly. According to Wikipedia,      Of primary cosmic rays, which originate outside of Earth's atmosphere, about 99% are the nuclei of well-known atoms (stripped of their electron shells), and about 1% are solitary electrons (similar to beta particles). Of the nuclei, about 90% are simple protons (i.e., hydrogen nuclei); 9% are alpha particles, identical to helium nuclei; and 1% are the nuclei of heavier elements, called HZE ions   Together, electrons and positrons need to be neutral in charge, right?  Only 1% are electrons.   How can they be neutral in charge? "
3011,How well can the Sun's surface be resolved by an observatory?,"There's no lack of photons, how well could a telescope resolve Sun spots and other surface features of the Sun? How would a high resolution Solar (space) telescope differ from for example Hubble which avoids the Sun by a 50° angle or so? "
3012,Black holes at the center of galaxies,At the center of massive galaxies there is a huge and massive black hole that radiates gamma rays. So at the center of the Milky Way there is also a huge and massive black hole and it also radiates gamma rays. Do these gamma rays reach our solar system? What is the age of black hole in the center of our galaxy? Does it still radiates gamma rays? 
3013,Why is Sagittarius A* called so?,"At the center of the Milky Way, we have a supermassive black hole. It's name is ""Sagittarius A*"". I was wondering that why is it called so? I mean, why ""A*"" why not just ""A"". Is there a naming system for super massive black holes?  Thanks! "
3014,Why is this Einstein ring pink?,"I'm having a hard time understanding this image in the CNN News item This glowing ring of light is from a distant galaxy.  The caption (from this version of the article) says:     This  image shows observations taken with the NASA/ ESA Hubble Space Telescope of two magnified galaxies behind massive galaxy clusters: the pink glowing haloes reveal the gas surrounding the distant galaxies and its structure. The gravitational lensing effect from the clusters multiplies the images of the galaxies, producing up to 4 images of the same source.   Trying to parse the caption, I think that the two objects in the center are magnified images of the galaxies in the background, and so should be related to the source of the light in the Einstein ring. But they are yellow and the ring is pink.  Question: So the Einstein ring is picking up light not from the background galaxies, but from a halo of gas around them? Is there a better source to read about this image and everything that's going on here?  The image contains the following label at the top right corner:    click for full size:      The article then says:     The MUSE instrument on the European Southern Observatory's Very Large Telescope has identified halos around distant galaxies. Previously, images of these glowing rings lacked detail, but astronomers were able to use a gravitational lensing effect of galaxy clusters to see detail and structure.      Gravitational lensing occurs as an effect of Albert Einstein's theory of general relativity: mass bends light. So the gravitational fields of galaxy clusters bend light, acting like a magnifier of the galaxies behind them.      The best observations of the halos by MUSE were released Monday, presented by Adélaïde Claeyssens during the annual meeting of the European Astronomical Society in Lyon, France. Claeyssens is a Ph.D. student at the Centre de Recherche Astrophysique de Lyon.   Which further confuses me because the caption mentions Hubble but the article mentions data from MUSE at the VLT. I wonder if the image is a file photo and only peripherally related to the content of the news article? "
3015,How long does it take for an asteroid to get to Earth?,"How long does it take an asteroid to get from the asteroid belt, to Earth? I know the asteroids don't go directly from the asteroid belt to Earth, but I know it's not quick, either. The time probably varies, but what's the average time? "
3016,"Draw the celestial sphere for latitude, showing the star Sirius, Estimate the approximate date when Sirius rises with the Sun","I'm having trouble understanding how to solve a certain problem.  The problem is from the book Astronomy: Principles and Practice by Roy and Clarke. It is actually a solved example, but I am unable to understand parts of the solution.     Draw the celestial sphere for latitude 30&deg; N, showing the star Sirius (right ascension   6h 40m, declination 17&deg; S) at rising and draw the ecliptic. Estimate from your diagram the approximate   date when Sirius rises with the Sun.     This is the image from the solution. I'll copy the entire solution.      Now, here's what I don't understand. If Sirius is at X, and if X is on a parallel of declination, why isn't this parallel parallel to the equatorial plane? Does the same go for the Sun? And how do we get the RA of the Sun? "
3017,Energy deposition in planet Earth due to gravitational waves,The gravitational wave detected by the LIGO observatory acted on planet Earth streching and shrinking it a little bit. I assume that not all of this action was fully elastic and that some energy of the gravitational wave was lost by the passage through planet Earth.  Are there some scientific estimates of how much energy was deposited in planet Earth by this gravitational wave?  Are there estimates how much energy is in total deposited by gravitational waves in planet Earth per year? 
3018,Gravitational waves: how can scientists derrive the sizes and spin and distance of two merging black holes?,"After recording the ripples of  passing gravity waves I would imagine that some high-power math would be required to derive information about the sizes, spin, and distance of the merging black holes. Is it possible to get some insight into how they figured out one was 31 solar masses and the other was 20? How do you ""see"" spin from a wave? "
3019,Quasar Redshifts,"How can the gravitational redshift of a very distant quasar be distinguished from its cosmological redshift? Quasars are very massive objects,thought to be supermassive black holes,so therefore must have substantial gravitational red shift,but they are so far away they must also have a cosmological redshift. Is it possible to distinguish one from the other? "
3020,Source for Identification of Balmer Hydrogen Absorption Lines,"I'm working on an assignment, where I have to classify stars using the raw data of the telescope. I'm now trying to calibrate the pixel to armstrong ratio, and for that I need to identify the absorption lines present on the star.  I've been researching for two days now, and I haven't been able to find a 'trustworthy' source of information/confirmation on where to set the Balmer absorption lines for a star like the one in the image (I'm positive H alpha (the one at the far right), beta (on top) and gamma (i would say the one at the left of H beta) are quite prominent).    So far, I am trusting on this page to do it. Is there a real source of info, be it a book, an institutional webpage or something, where I can confirm and that I could reference for an assignment? Am I wrong on the position of the Balmer Series? "
3021,Can Eight Retrograde (seen from Earth) planets occur?,"First of all, for the purposes of this question Pluto is a planet. So the eight planets being considered are Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune and Pluto.   My question is: can all eight of these planets go retrograde† at the same time? I know that seven can do so on rare instances; there were 12 days of that in the 20th century all in the 1940's and the 1980's. But to show how rare that is there was a block of 400 years in the middle ages with no days of seven retrogrades. Has eight ever happened? Or is it impossible?   †Retrograde motion as seen from Earth, not retrograde orbits around the Sun. "
3022,Why nobody cares to give the nearest stars better names?,"The star occupying 6th place on Wikipedia's list of nearest stars and brown dwarfs can be called either Lalande 21185, BD+36 2147, Gliese 411 or HD 95735. That seems to me like a fine, quadruple choice of equally bad names.   I mean, I know these come from positions held in various star catalogues and maybe aren't that bad compared to monstrosities like WISE J085510.83−071442.5, but can't we keep those for stars like 50 light yrs away and invent something better for our nearest neighbours?  This year we saw a batch of confirmations for planets orbiting in habitable zones of many of these stars. In not so distant future we may find ourselves discussing possibility of sending probes to some of these systems. Aren't better names long overdue? "
3023,What size objects can be created from collision of two asteroids?,"Does collision of two asteroids necessarily create only very small objects? (and how big is it ""very small""?)  I am especially interested about collision of two asteroids with similar orbits (and thus relatively small difference of the speed vectors in the moment of collision).  Can such a collision create big (say 1km, or maybe 100m) objects?  Is it in this case likely that a created object would have something like a comet tail consisting of dust and small objects (probably gravitionally attracted to the resulting asteroid remnant)? "
3024,Are all satellites thought to be the result of collisions with the planets?,"The leading hypothesis for how the Moon was formed was that another object collided with the Earth, throwing off a large lump of matter which formed into the moon.  Is this thought to be the case with all satellites? e.g. Phobos, Deimos, Charon, Titan, Europa, etc. ? If not, then why do we need such a dramatic ""origin story"" for the Moon but not the others? Why do we not just assume the Moon was formed the same way as all satellites? "
3025,Age of Occator Crater,"Has any official information been published regarding the estimated age of the Occator crater on Ceres?  I ran some quick searches but couldn't find anything putting a definitive (or even speculative) date on the moment of impact.  I ask because based upon my own very amateur analysis of the imagery:    ...there seems to be a marked decrease in the amount of secondary cratering visible within a fairly uniform radius of the main crater.    My assumption is that when the impact occurred, the surrounding area was likely blanketed by material kicked up from the impact site, obscuring most pre-existing craters (smaller ones, in particular).  Kind of like fresh snowfall, except made of rock.    So for a (small) secondary crater to be visible near Occator, the impact would have to have occurred after the impact that created Occator crater.  Meaning that the relative lack of small craters near Occator would seem to imply a fairly recent impact (""recent"" in terms of Ceres geological timescales), I believe?  Is there any official data that would confirm or refute this? "
3026,Does New Moon Affect Stargazing After MoonSet?,Referencing the following data for December 11th 2017.  [website]To get a dark sky for stargazing does it matter if the moon is at 37.8% so long as it is below the horizon when I'm observing?   Since the moon will be set at 1:32PM on the 11th and not rise again until 1:59AM on the 12th I would assume the moon would not affect viewing between those times.   Furthermore is there a guideline as to how close to moonrise the moon will start to have an affect? 
3027,Does Jupiter help to protect the Earth against comets/asteroids impacts?,"Does Jupiter help to protect the Earth against comets or asteroids impacts?     Some astronomers believe that one reason Earth is habitable is that the gravity of Jupiter does help protect us from some comets. Long-period comets, in particular, enter the solar system from its outer reaches. Jupiter’s gravity is thought to sling most of these fast-moving ice balls out of the solar system before they can get close to Earth. So long-period comets are thought to strike Earth only on very long timescales of millions or tens of millions of years. Without Jupiter nearby, long-period comets would collide with our planet much more frequently.   From: [website]Intuitively speaking, it would seem to me that while any massive body in the Solar System would deflect the trajectories of some comets/asteroids that would otherwise pose a threat to Earth, it also must be true that some few ones that were not in a collision course would then be directed to us after having their trajectories deflected. Why isn't that the case? "
3028,What does it mean for space to expand?,"In this YT video Michelle Thaller says The Big Bang wasn’t an explosion but an expansion and as such there's no empty center where the explosion would've been.  To explain expansion she uses the analogies of surface of a balloon being blown up and stretching a rubber sheet.  But isn't it true that any shape, be it having an edge (the sheet) or a balloon/sphere, would have a point that isn't expanding? ... the center of an expanding 2D rectangle, a sphere or cube, etc?  Is it more accurate to say that it's not like a sheet or balloon but that either every point in space is expanding three dimensionally, or, that space is actually not expanding, because it doesn't exist, and that what we call 'space expanding' is actually cosmic entities traveling in uncoordinated directions?  [website]"
3029,Will we be able to see our galaxy if we travel far enough?,"Will we be able to see our galaxy if we travel far enough? When we leave earth far enough, we'll be able to see Earth from distant, is it same with the galaxy? if we travel far enough, will we see the shape of our galaxy with naked eye?  Do we have to travel really far to see our galaxy like a dot? or just far enough to realize the size and shape of our galaxy? "
3030,what would a captured planet do if it was in a retrograde orbit?,"If our solar system some how captured a rogue planet, and it orbited the sun in the opposite direction to all the other planets,  what major affect would it have on the stability, would its drag cause all the other planets to slow down ?  could it be possible for it to be sustained at all ? "
3031,What defines stationary vs spinning in space?,"To produce artificial gravity on a space station, we simply spin it around some central point, and the acceleration makes objects ""fall"" outwards. If our space station is so far in deep space that it cannot detect any light from stars whatsoever, we can still tell if we are spinning or not based on the artificial gravity produced.  Why? What are we spinning relative to? If I were to take a stationary space station and spin everything else in the universe around it, would it produce the same effect?  Or to put it another way, suppose I took all of the matter in the Universe and made it into a gigantic disk. Would it be possible to spin the disk? What would it be spinning relative to? "
3032,How can the oblateness of Earth impart torque to change the longitude of ascending node of a satellite?,"I've read that you can change the longitude of ascending node of a satellite (i.e. changing the orbital plane without changing the inclination) to change its orbital plane by using the torque imparted by the oblateness of Earth. How does this happen exactly? I mean how does the oblateness of Earth cause a torque induced precession of a satellite?  PS. I think I don't understand how torque induced precession works and that's why I am not able to understand this. So if any of you kind gentlefolk are willing to explain, I thank you in advance.  EDIT: I just came across Nodal Precession. And from what I understood that due to Earth's equatorial bulge, the gravitational force vector is offset from its center, thus producing torque. I can visualize how the longitude of ascending node will change, but can't visualise how will the change in the torque caused by slightly offset gravitational force vector will cause it. "
3033,When did astronomy first discover that the stars are bigger than the moon?,"We take it for granted these days that the stars are unimaginably bigger than the planets and the moons. But when you look at the sky, it does not appear this way.   The moon looks bigger and brighter than the stars. This leads me to wonder when astronomy first discovered the relative size of the stars.    Did people believe that the moon was bigger than the stars for a long time?  If so, where was this believed, and up until when?  What discoveries or observations led people to conclude that the stars are larger?  "
3034,Causes of emission of accretion disk,"As far as I can see, there are two main sources for the emission of energy from an accretion disk:   release of gravitational potential energy of the infalling matter; friction from differential rotation within the disk.   How much of the emitted energy is due to each process? For that matter, are there any other processes that contribute to the spectrum? "
3035,"Why does spectral class and U-V colour correlate slightly differently for main sequence, giant and supergiant stars?","  In this diagram the [tex]-axis is spectral type for stars and the [tex]-axis is B-V colour.  Taking Series 1 as the Main Sequence, Series 2 as Giants and Series 3 as Super-giants. Why the spectral class for all these stars differ from the other ones?  If we were to say differences, for instance, how would one express that information? "
3036,How do we define temperature in outer space?,"I was recently reading an article on space.com about : What's the Temperature of Outer Space.  They said :     Some parts of space are hot! Gas between stars, as well as the solar wind, both seem to be what we call ""empty space,"" yet they can be more than a thousand degrees, even millions of degrees.   But here is my question - ""How do we define temperature in outer space?""  We perceive temperature as the average translational kinetic energy associated with the disordered motion of atoms and moleculules, so how can the temperature be so high at some places, if there isn't any (or very, very few) molecules out there in vacuum? "
3037,"How are ""parallel fields"" implemented on the Hubble Space Telescope?","The Phys.org news item Hubble is the ultimate multitasker: Discovering asteroids while it's doing other observations mentions the Hubble Space Telescope's use of parallel fields:     A couple years ago, the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope was observing very distant galaxies, some of them billions of light years away. It was part of the Frontier Fields Project (FFP,) an ambitious observing program which aimed to observe six massive galaxy clusters. The FFP pushed Hubble to its limits.      [...]      This image is a couple years old now, and it shows what's called the parallel field for the Abell 370 galaxy cluster, about 4 billion light years away. It's called a parallel field because of the technique used to capture it.      A press release explains parallel fields this way:      ""While observing each cluster with one of the cameras on Hubble, the team also used a different camera, pointing in a slightly different direction, to photograph six so-called 'parallel fields."" This maximised Hubble's observational efficiency in doing deep space exposures, imaging a myriad of far away galaxies.""   Question: How are ""parallel fields"" implemented on the Hubble Space Telescope? How are two cameras able to take different exposures in different directions at the same time? What optical components points them in different directions?  "
3038,Question regarding the path of sun crossing zenith before the summer solstice,"I stay in Bangalore, India (12.9716° N, 77.5946° E). For my latitude, the Sun crosses zenith (the highest point in the sky) on 24th of April every Summer, which happens to be about 2 months prior to the June solstice (summer solstice to us here in the Northern Hemisphere).  Shouldn't the Sun be reaching its highest point on the longest day, i.e. on June 21st, instead of April 24th? Doesn't the Sun take the longest arc across the sky on the day it passes through zenith?  For reference, the angle at which the Sun rises/sets in my location is about 13 degrees, which happens to be almost vertical to the horizon. "
3039,Dark matter emitting EM radiations beyond our currently known spectrum?,"Could it be possible that dark matter is emitting EM radiations on a scale that is not known or perceivable by humans yet and undetectable by man-made instruments?   A type of radiation that our instruments were just not designed to pick up on? Being insensitive and not advanced enough? Thus we do not yet have all the pieces to solve the puzzle?  Edit: We need to remember that there are infrared and gamma rays on either end of the spectrum and we are aware that dark matter is definitely not emitting visible light, or any of the other type of EM waves. Considering that gamma rays were discovered roughly only a hundred years ago, isn't it possible that the spectrum could be further extended on either side and that we're still not aware of it? "
3040,Why can't we feel the Earth's revolution?,"I googled it and checked a few Q&amp;A and there's only things about ""Earth's rotation"". But why can't we feel the revolution?  They say we can't feel the rotation because the Earth spins at a constant speed. Okay, I get what happens for the rotation, but isn't it different when it comes to the revolution?    At night we feel the sum of speed of green and blue, whereas at day we should feel the sum of speed of green and minus blue, shouldn't we? In other words, shouldn't we feel the changes in velocity by times? "
3041,"If the Universe is infinite, would heat death be impossible?","If the Universe is infinite, one would imagine that if we kept moving through space, we'd constantly find newer and newer galaxies and objects forever. This would imply that there is an infinite amount of matter in the Universe.  The heat death theory states that, eventually, there will be no free energy left in the Universe. Stars would no longer form, black holes would eventually evaporate, and the Universe would be effectively dead. But if there's an infinite amount of matter, won't there always be more gas clouds that haven't formed stars, more stars that have yet to become black holes, etc.? If there is an infinite amount matter and energy, shouldn't more activity be possible no matter how many stars go out or how many black holes evaporate?  One might say that with enough time, all matter in the Universe would still run dry. But if there is an infinite amount, there should always be areas in which activity is still going on...right?  Is what I'm saying correct? Does the heat death of the Universe contradict the theory that it is infinite? "
3042,What Is The Maximum Distance Our Finest Instruments Could See When They're Perfected?,"Radius of the observable universe is 47.5 billion light years,which means we are seeing things which are about 48 billion light years away. At a rough estimate,at what distance would our finest instruments and telescopes be unable to see or detect anything at all,&amp; is there anything in the idea that if we were able to see far enough,we might see our own galaxy as it appears from an immense distance,its light having circled the universe? And as space is not a perfect vacuum,wouldn't the light be significantly retarded by the end of such a long journey? "
3043,Hypothetical: Is the interstellar wormhole too close to the black hole?,"Most reasonings about hypothetical wormholes say, that you need an extreme amount of energy to keep them open.  Given that, isn’t the worm hole too close to the black hole gargantua? The gravity between the two would make the spin and eventually collapse together? "

3045,Luminosity of black hole accretion disc,"The luminosity of a black hole accretion disc gaining mass at a rate [tex] can be estimated as  [tex]  That is a substantial proportion of the rest mass of the in-falling matter. The linked document explains that the factor 1/12 is because at less than 3 times the event horizon radius the matter ""spirals in without radiating more energy""   What causes matter in the accretion disk not to radiate beyond this limit? It is twice the radius of the photon sphere, is the reason general relativity? "
3046,Is there any explanation for astrology?,"Is there any astronomical point of view of astrology? Do you know any interesting study which proves or refutes it?

3047,Fate of the Spiral Arms of the Milky Way and Andromeda,"In a few billion years, the Milky Way and Andromeda will collide. Chances are, there won't be many spectacular stellar collisions, and there's a pretty good chance that the Solar system (and most other stellar systems) won't be flung out into deep space, or be torn apart by incoming stars. But what about on a larger scale?  The product of the collision - dubbed ""Milkomeda"" - will be an elliptical galaxy, unlike the Milky Way and Andromeda, which are both spiral galaxies. My question is this:  How will the structure of the spiral arms be effectively destroyed by the collision? What mechanisms will cause them to coalesce, and what structures will take their place? "
3048,Why is the cloud around Eta Carinae shaped the way it is?,"According to (german) wikipedia, Eta Carinae has a cloud shaped like two cones with the points at the poles of the star as well as a disk around the equator. These matter clouds are mostly or only condensed stellar wind from Eta Carinae.  In my understanding, to create the dual-cone chape, the stellar wind provding the matter originates at the poles and this gives the dual cone shape (Ok?).  Why the poles? Stellar wind would, I guess, be mostly stellar matter so hot it reaches escape velocity, further pushed by the radiation. This should be isotropic. I can only guess that maybe Eta Carina has a magnetic field shaped similarly to earth with a north and south pole, nearer the equator the stellar wind is perpendicular to the field lines so the flightpaths of the charged particles are bent back inward. Near the poles the flightpaths and field lines are mostly paralell, so the magnetic field does not really act on the stellar wind. I included this guesswork on my part so you know where to start.  ETA: Turns out my guessing about stellar wind was wrong or mostly wrong, the cloud appears to be mostly shaped by eruptions in recentish history. But the question why they are shaped that way still stands. "

3050,Head on collision of two black holes,"Inspired by If two black hole event horizons overlap (touch) can they ever separate again?, I was wondering what would happen if two black holes collided into each other in a head-on collision.  In this model there's two black holes on a 3d Cartesian plane. Each black hole has a mass of 1 billion solar masses, and they're both going 0.9c. They're traveling on the z axis in opposite directions.  If both black holes are not spinning, one traveling positive z, the other in negative z, and collide at the origin in a perfect head-on collision what would be the result?  How long would a full merger take, and what would the resulting spin be? Would there be a large wave of gravitational energy, or some other emission?  I don't believe this to be a duplicate of Would LIGO Detect Head-On Collision? as suggested by @John Rennie or @uhoh beucase I'm more asking what's the effect on the BH themselves and what type of emissions are involved. Not necessarily ones detectable by LIGO. "
3051,Looking at ourselves with a powerful telescope?,Could a small curved mirror and/or lens in Earth's orbit be aimed at a different hemisphere from where you are be be viewed with a powerful telescope to see the ground through the mirror? Would a more powerful telescope than the Hubble see more or less because of the atmosphere diffracting light twice?  Bonus: Would sending a mirror to space cost less this way then a huge camera/telescope? 
3052,Struggling to understand the phases of the moon," Source  Typically this diagram is how the phases of the moon are explained but the issue is this, namely, the phases seen on the right half are not possible. All the phases should appear on the left half during the night when the moon is typically most visible.   So how on earth are the phases even generated?   The most remarkable phases are waning moon phases because the moon is lit up on the face away from the sun light source.   What am I missing?   I’ve edited the question by adding two additional photos showing the progression of the moon in the night sky over the course of a given time interval and several days, as well as a synodic month which would hopefully indicate based on the position of the moon the sequence of days and based on the height the time of day/night.

3053,Thought experiment about the outskirts of the universe,"Suppose I aim at some object that is 13 billion light years away from Earth. Let's assume I have a twin that pilots a ship that travels in infinite speed, meaning that he can reach that object  and get back here in a split second. On the other hand I'm the poor brother, and I own a ship with top speed of only at 99.9% of c.  We leave earth at the same time, with the same destination. My ship accelerates at constant rate for a full day until we reach max speed, then we enjoy the travel without accelerating for a second time.  1) how long will it take me to meet my brother, and how older will he be?  2) what will be the age of the universe, according to me?  3) what will be my current speed relative to surrounding objects before decelerating? Would I be able to accelerate and reach max speed again? If yes, what's the point of accelerating later rather than sooner, and having a top speed after all?  4) And a plot twist: suppose that while in travel I build a second ship exactly the same as mine. When we're about to arrive we choose a distant point 13 billion light years away in the same direction, and I send a friend on it, who accelerates until he reaches 99.9% of c relative to me. If we repeat that for N times, will we ever reach ""free space"" where matter didn't reach yet, or some other cosmologically interesting place? How does it look like there? If not, a) can we tinker with any parameters in order to do it ""right""? b) any other plans on getting there?  I understand relativity from what I learned in college (long time ago), is there any other theory needed to understand such traveling questions?  "
3054,What parameters determine whether galaxies colliding will result in a merger or a hit and run?,"Colliding galaxies sometimes merge and sometimes pass through each other. Either way, there are huge changes as a result. What are the parameters that matter in determining whether a collision will result in a merger or a hit and run, or something in between? What will be the result of the Milky Way-Andromeda collision?  Thinking about this some more, I suppose the most clearcut distinctions for the result would be whether the two supermassive black holes end up unbound, bound, or merged. Would it be possible for the bulk of the two galaxies to merge, but one or two of the SMBH's go on their merry way? "
3055,What irradiance does the Moon receive during a total lunar eclipse?,"As we know, the total solar irradiance normally received by the Moon is about 1361 [tex] (the same as the top of the Earth's atmosphere). Of course, this changes during lunar eclipses, but the Moon doesn't go completely dark even during total eclipses (it's usually just a dim red). It still receives light through the Earth's atmosphere. My question is how much?  I've tried googling this, but all the search terms I could think of just gave me a bunch of unrelated astrology results. Surely people have measured this.  The worst case irradiance for any part of the Moon during a total eclipse is fine for my purposes, but I wouldn't mind a paper with an intensity curve over time if there are any.  Edit: This is not a duplicate of ""Red Moon a Characteristic of all Total Lunar Eclipses?"" That question is asking if all lunar eclipses are red and/or if the amount of redness varies. I'm asking how much light hits the Moon (per second per area) during a total lunar eclipse. Furthermore, none of the answers there even mention irradiance. "
3056,Why aren't the farthest objects close to each other?,The last years we find some objects like this : MACS0647-JD which are more than 13 billion light-years away from us.   This means that the picture we get was created only some million years after the Big Bang.  Why can we see objects like this in all directions? Shouldn't those objects be close to each other? 
3057,Why can you see both aurorae at the same time?,"I wanted to know how it is possible to see both aurora borealis and aurora australis at the same time, since this video seems to suggest that it is possible.  [website]Also the NASA video (THEMIS Sees Magnetic Reconnection) suggests the same: [website]I think that if the magnetic field is going from north to south then the electrons would also flow to just one of the poles, but clearly they flow to both. Why is that?  "
3058,Questions about spiral galaxy arms,"I have 2 questions related to spiral galaxies.  Firstly, how did the arms form? Why would the stars accumulate into those specific areas? And secondly, why are they still intact?  The inner parts of the arms must be revolving more rapidly than the outer parts, so surely the would become stretched and then no longer resemble arms, but simply a disk around the galactic center. "
3059,How to use spectral profiles to determine luminosity class?,"I know the luminosity classes are: Ia-0 ( Hypergiants ), Ia ( bright supergiants ), ... , VII ( white dwarf ).  I also have learned that you can use the presence of absorption lines ( ie. use spectral profiles ) to determine which spectral type a star belongs to: presence of helium lines imply O-type, and Hydrogen lines in A-type, getting fainter as the star gets cooler, etc.  I was told that one can use spectral profiles to determine luminosity class ( Ia-0, Ia, Ib, ... ), that the width of the spectral lines indicate the luminosity class: Ia stars have sharp lines, and V stars have broad lines...  How about Ib, II, III, IV, VI, VII?  I mean... how can I distinguish between Ib and II?  Given examples of Ia lines and V lines, you can tell whether an additional line is broader or sharper, but then guess that this additional line is Ib, II, III, or IV?  Is there a more concrete method of determining luminosity class from spectral profiles? "
3060,Is the mechanism of solar flares on red dwarfs and brown dwarfs the same as that on the Sun?,"The Sun has solar flares that are caused when there is a magnetic reconnection in the Sun's atmosphere, causing a loop of magnetic field to be ejected at high energy, along with a large number of protons, giving a intense burst of radiation.  Other stars - notably some red dwarfs - have much more intense flares than the Sun does. Is the mechanism the same in these stars as in the Sun, and in larger stars? What causes the flares in red dwarfs, and even brown dwarfs? Why do less powerful stars have more powerful flares?  Jupiter also has a magnetic field, and it's magnetosphere is composed of plasmas. Why aren't ""Jovian Flares"" seen?  Related: How do large solar flares compare to flares on other stars? "
3061,Is a black hole a perfect sphere?,"I know all about how black holes form and why their gravity is so strong. However, is the gravity equally powerful in all directions? Will the event horizon appear as a perfect sphere? "
3062,How does the appearance of the analemma vary with latitude,"How does the appearance of an analemma vary with latitude?  This what I take to be a definition of an analemma: If the position of the sun is plotted or photographed at noon clock time (say UTC) every day from a position facing due south (in the northern hemisphere) it forms a figure of eight shape as in the picture.   Photographs usually show it with the long axis at an angle. My question is, assuming that the angle is related to the latitude of the camera, how does this angle vary as the camera is moved from the equator to the pole, and why? "
3063,"Is it possible to see Saturn from Titan's surface, day and night?","Titan is the only moon in our solar system with a thick atmosphere, similar to what our Earth's atmosphere was before life ""appeared"". It also orbits Saturn close enough to actually see it beautifully in the sky... or can it?  Titan has a very thick and hazy atmosphere. Tholin seems to be the main factor of this ""haziness"". Also we can't see Titan's surface from space without infrared instruments. So in visible light, Titan looks like an almost uniform ball of beige, yellowish, golden brown because of its atmosphere, hiding the surface below.  So this should probably be the same case the other way around, right? Can we see Saturn from the surface of Titan, or does the haziness hide the parent planet from view during day time and night time (since I believe the atmosphere's opacity changes in day time and night time)? "
3064,What is the closest candidate for Dark Matter currently?,I've both fascinated and frustrated after learning about the existence of Dark Matter.

3066,"What phenomenon causes ""lunar waves""?","In multiple video clips of the moon but also one of Jupiter, some kind of waves can be observed.

[website][website]There is an answer on Quora, but I would love to see a more detailed answer, why we can see exactly these two rather sharp lines moving. "
3067,Studies on planets without parent star,"I am interested in studies and/or publications about planets that wander in space and are not orbiting around a star or its remnants. These dark and frozen worlds should've got ripped away from their respective system by a large passing body (another star? passing black hole) or any other astronomical event (which one?).  I am curious, whether there exist statistical estimates on the number of such planets and the rate at which they are produced. I am also interested in reading about the statistical models that can produce those estimates and encode researchers' beliefs. If there are no such models, why?  A provoking thought: According to Greek, such planets are really fitting their name πλάνητες ἀστέρες (planētes asteres, ""wandering stars"") or simply πλανῆται (planētai, ""wanderers""). It is frightening to imagine such world that drifts deeper and deeper into empty space. Forever. "
3068,Mechanism for Brown Dwarf Fusion,"I've read (at here, among other places) that during the Degenerate Era, star formation will end and the last stars will go out. But it was noted that there is still the possibility of star birth, coming from the collision of two stellar remnants, such as brown dwarfs (although white dwarfs also have the potential for such a collision). When two brown dwarfs collide, if they have enough combined mass, fusion can begin.  This is much different from how normal stars form today, and how they fuse hydrogen and other elements. So my question is this:   Will there be any major differences between the fusion process in the new ""star"" and a star with the same mass that formed via traditional star formation (i.e. collapse of a gas cloud)? Also, how will this affect the new ""star's"" life cycle? "
3069,How much time does it take for a meteor (shooting star) to touch the ground after its combustion?,"I know that meteors that We see as shooting stars travel tens of thousands of kilometers per hour and are tiny as a grain of sand, but after hitting the atmosphere and burn I suppose that its ashes would touch the ground at some point. How long does it take? Can it be measured or observed? "
3070,What would stargazing be like at the edge of our galaxy?,"Let's say, for the sake of speculation, we acquire the technology necessary to travel to the outer edge of one of the spiral arms of our galaxy. We go to a star in this ""outer rim"" and land on a planet orbiting a star there. What would we see when our side of the planet is facing outward from the galaxy? (Assume no atmospheric interference.) The answer will, of course, depend on the galactic coordinates of the star we choose to visit. Provided a particular set of coordinates, how much do we know about what we could see with the naked eye or through some form of optical instrument? I'm more interested in our ability to answer the question, rather than the specific objects we'd see (although they're pretty interesting too). You're welcome to select an arbitrary but still useful and appropriate boundary as the edge of the spiral arm.  "
3071,Could the universe have evolved differently?,"Given the initial conditions at the Big Bang, could our universe have evolved any differently? In other words, did the initial conditions predetermine every stage in the evolution of the universe to this day, or - if we ""roll the tape backward"" and play it again - could the universe be entirely different on the macro scale (eg. no stars and galaxies)? "
3072,Space curvature and its rotation,"As I learn, the gravity is caused by the spacetime curvature. Is there any gravitational/magnetic field that really exists around the Earth, or any other planets?  Since the planets/stars rotate, does this cause the space time curvature to twist in the direction of their rotation? If it does then the gravitational pull should also twist the the path of the objects falling(though we may not perceive the curvature of this path, we should be  able to calculate at-least theoretically) "
3073,Planet with acid ice caps,"I remember reading an old astronomy book mentioning a certain planet and the main point of interest was that this planet has or may have polar ice caps but of acid. I can't remember the name though, what planet or planets fit this description?   Now there some very strange worlds out there though I'm unsure whether this one may or may not be all that strange. Is this something of an oddity or is a planet containing frozen acid not that uncommon? "
3074,Could asteroid 'Oumuamua actually be round?,"News articles have mentioned that the recently discovered asteroid 'Oumuamua is theorized to be greatly elongated based on observations of brightness variation. However, this hypothesis seems to be based on the assumption that the object's albedo distribution is reasonably uniform. What if it isn't? Could large periodic brightness variations also be explained by 'Oomuamua having two highly contrasting hemispheres like Iapetus? If the astronomers involved have already eliminated this competing explanation, how would they have done so and with what additional observational data? "
3075,During what time of the year can Centaurus be seen from Tokyo?,"During exactly what dates of the year can the Centaurus constellation be seen from Tokyo, Japan?

3079,"Is the point of this paper to say that Pluto's status as a planet should have been handled scientifically, rather than by a vote?","The abstract of a paper currently in-press in Icarus: The Reclassification of Asteroids from Planets to Non-Planets (Metzger et al. 2018, [website]  It is often claimed that asteroids‘ sharing of orbits is the reason they were re-classified from planets to non-planets. A critical review of the literature from the 19th Century to the present shows this is factually incorrect. The literature shows the term asteroid was broadly recognized as a subset of planet for 150 years. On-going discovery of asteroids resulted in a de facto stretching of the concept of planet to include the ever-smaller bodies. Scientists found utility in this taxonomic identification as it provided categories needed to argue for the leading hypothesis of planet formation, Laplace‘s nebular hypothesis. In the 1950s, developments in planet formation theory found it no longer useful to maintain taxonomic identification between asteroids and planets, Ceres being the primary exception. At approximately the same time, there was a flood of publications on the geophysical nature of asteroids showing them to be geophysically different than the large planets. This is when the terminology in asteroid publications calling them planets abruptly plunged from a high level of usage where it had hovered during the period 1801 – 1957 to a low level that held constant thereafter. This marks the point where the community effectively formed consensus that asteroids should be taxonomically distinct from planets. The evidence demonstrates this consensus formed on the basis of geophysical differences between asteroids and planets, not the sharing of orbits. We suggest attempts to build consensus around planetary taxonomy not rely on the non-scientific process of voting, but rather through precedent set in scientific literature and discourse, by which perspectives evolve with additional observations and information, just as they did in the case of asteroids. (emphasis added)   On the website there is also:     Highlights         The literature on asteroid classification is reviewed from 1801 to the present.   Scientists considered asteroids to be planets until the 1950s.   Thousands of asteroids sharing orbits was not debarring from planet status.   They were reclassified as non-planets on the basis of geophysical characteristics.   Taxonomical terms like planet are determined by the scientific process, not voting. (emphasis added)      It sounds like they are saying that Pluto's status as a planet was removed by a vote, more than by scientific consensus, and that while the title suggests that the paper is about ""Asteroids"" it seems the scenario might actually be proxy for Pluto's demotion.  Question: Am I misunderstanding, or is that really the main point of the last few sentences of the abstract, if not the entire paper?  Here's an example of another situation of classification being in flux: Do astronomers generally agree that the distinction between comets and astroids is not so clear? "

3083,Does the mass of the Earth change?,"Every day, babies are born and people grow, which makes their respective masses greater. However, this change in mass (should) come out of the food that they consume - it is used as energy and thus converted into this growth. Likewise, building new structures is just a redistribution of mass already on Earth.  Thus, the only way I can see the actual mass of the Earth changing is by meteors that have landed here (increase in mass) and things that leave Earth such as space shuttles and rockets which would be  a decrease in mass.  But have I missed anything out? If no meteors crashed into Earth, and we had not yet figured out how to make machines that could fly, would the mass of the Earth remain constant? Or is it somehow loosing or gaining mass? Am I wrong in assuming that the growth of animals doesn't affect the mass?  Thanks, Toastrackenigma.  EDIT: Mass includes atmosphere :) "

I mean, would physics work differently than they would at home? Would radioactive atoms take longer to decay in a way you could measure and compare with your earth-based decay tables? Anything?  Or the only way to find out would be simply to step out of the spaceship and find out that life on Earth has gone extinct in the last couple of hours?  And another question related to the first. If you were travelling in the spaceship at that speed in the X-axis direction and you handthrew a baseball in that same direction, would that ball's mass or inertia explode asyntotically to practically infinity since you are increasing a fantastically high speed a tiny winy bit more? Or perhaps you could not threw the ball at all because of the huge mass increase being that close already to the speed of light? Or you wouldn't notice nothing special and a regular sized with normal weight baseball would impact the other side of the room at a relative speed to you of 60 km/h? "
3089,Stellar core mass as a function of metallicity,"Using Hurley's 2000 paper on Single Stellar Evolution, I have graphed the core mass of a star at three stages as a function of metallicity, Z, for a chosen ZAMS mass: at the beginning of the HG (MS), at the end of the Hertzprung-Gap (HG), and at the Base of the Asymptotic Giant Branch (BAGB).   All three functions have a cusp at Z = 0.0005 which I 1) do not understand physically and 2) wonder if it is incorrect? Is this expected? I would have expected that the core mass is monotonic in metallicity, Z. The cusp is present for any ZAMS mass chosen.   EDIT: The equations I use are...  Core mass at beginning of HG: [tex] is the product of equation 29 and the core mass at the end of the HG described below ([tex] is always [tex]).  Core mass at end of HG: [tex] is, using equation 28 over the relevant mass range the HG ends at Helium Ignition, given by equation 44, where I solved for the time, [tex], in equation 35 and substituted that into equation 34 to find that [tex], and following the procedure given in the paragraph below equation 65 (where it references equation 44). I used equation 49b for the Luminosity here.  Core mass at BAGB: [tex] is equation 66.  I'm only interested in stars above [tex], so I do not consider the possibility of a Blue Loop phase for simplicity.  "
3090,Is it possible to mount a telescope on a plane? Is it beneficial?,"I was wondering if any planes had mounted telescopes with the intent to observe the stars. I understand that the atmosphere itself can warp and hinder incoming light and even completely obscure views on cloudy days. Would it be possible to have a telescope which could account for the speed of the airplane and remove motion blur? Would it even be worth it, seeing as the size of the lens would also be limited? Could we see anything interesting that a terrestrial scope of the same size would miss?  Hobbes has mentioned SOFIA as a great example of this being done. Does anyone have more information on the benefits of a plane mounted telescope over one on the ground for noninfrared observation? "
3091,Is there a term for stars without any planets?,"Quite simply, is there any used term for stars that don't have any planets? While contemplating this and doing numerous searches to no avail, I think I found my own answer, but I'm asking here for more input.  The reason I think there is no real term used as such is because there is yet to be confirmed of any stars that do not consist of any planets. I'm aware that we know of stars at this point in time where we haven't identified any planets YET, but that is not the same as actually confirming if planets do or do not exist around the star.   Am I correct in assuming this is the reason why no term has came to fruition yet? Or is there a term used in relation to talking about the possibility of none existing?  I've searched a fair bit for this but haven't been able to find anything. I know that current models show that it's highly unlikely for this to occur, but I'm curious. "
3092,"How ""fast"" do astronomical events occur?","I've seen quite a few news about astronomy but I'm not deep into knowing how it works or how people observe it. It got me thinking: if I want to watch a supernova for example, how long will I have to look for it to watch the whole ""event""? Or events like NASA ""seeing something coming out of a black hole"", were they ""looking"" at the blackhole when something came out really quickly or did they observe it for months? Or maybe the birth of a blackhole?  Now, I do know black holes that quite a few trillion of years to vanish, I'm just curious how much time does it take for astronomers to observe such events. "
3093,How to figure out what something in the sky is?,"A while ago I saw something in the sky early in the evening. At first, I thought it was a plane since it seemed far too bright to be a star - no other stars could be seen. However, it didn't move, so I ruled out that possibility.  It seemed to be relatively close to the horizon so I considered if it was a very high pole with some sort of light at the top, but after I walked for a few kilometres it was still at the same location.  During the few hours I looked at it, it moved a bit across the sky.  I considered a satellite, but it didn't seem to move quite enough of what I anticipated a satellite would move.  Since then, I have seen it every evening when I remember to look for it.  Apart from this object only the moon could be seen. To me, it seemed like the moon moved in the same arched way across the sky as the object, but I could be wrong on the.  I have seen several questions on this site where someone asks ""what was it?"" which has been closed with ""too broad"". So I am not going to ask what it was. Instead I am curious about what I can do to figure out what it is? Which observations is relevant to make when looking at such objects? As someone who is curious about the sky, but does not have any instruments for doing any actual measurements can I actually do anything?  The first picture shows the object in the sky.   The second picture shows the same object, but where I have indicated the arch the object moved in as well as the moon and how that moved.  "

3095,Adaptive Optics Shack-Hartmann Sensor and Deformable Mirror,"I have a technical question regarding the Shack-Hartmann sensor in deformable mirrors.  What algorithm is used to take the Shack-Hartmann measurements of local tilt and turn them into a full phase estimate that can be passed to the  deformable mirror?    (Source: Wikipedia1)  I see that the the sensor itself can generate an estimate of the derivative of the wavefront [tex] by observing the offset of the centroid of the guidestar. If the delta in from center of the guidestar is [tex] and [tex] then the derivative of the wavefront in that region is proportional [tex]:  [tex] and [tex]  Geary's Introduction to wavefront sensors2 has the following diagram:    with the comment: ""To reconstruct the wavefront, the local tilts must be stitched together"".   Is it enough to connect them end-to-end, perhaps make them non-negative, and pass them on? The values transmitted are usually Zernike Polynomial modes, so do we we desire to make them positive or zero mean? What algorithm is actually used to take the Shack-Hartmann measurements of local tilt and turn them into a full phase estimate that can be passed to the deformable mirror?  1 By 2pem - Own work, CC BY-SA 3.0, [website]2 Geary, Joseph M..

3096,Objects entering or leaving the observable universe,"Have there been any observations of objects entering or leaving the observable universe?  When looking at the physical limit of observing something like this I will to assume that the ""object"" would be an galaxy. I think it would be a good assumption to choose the size of such an galaxy, [tex], to be in the order of [tex] light years and the radius of the observable universe, [tex], is [tex] light years. Using the limit of angular resolution and the fact that the current biggest telescope has a diameter of 22.8 meters, then the longest wave length which would still yield would be about [tex]. When reversing the redshift, assuming this would be around [tex], then the longest emitted wave length which would be detected would be [tex].  So observing such an event would technically be possible, however relative to the astronomical timescale we have only been able to observe with such a high resolution for a very short time, so the probability will not be very high.  And if such an event would be observed, would such an object suddenly appear/disappear. It will take along time for an entire galaxy due it size, so this would translate to more of a fade. Or will something else happen? "
3097,Where/how are metals distributed in our universe?,"For one particular kind of element, what is the distribution in the whole universe?  Are most of the metals located in ISM, IGM, or stars? Maybe different metals have different distributions? For example, could most of the Mg be found in white dwarfs? Have all the natural elements have been found in stars? "
3098,"If there are neutron stars, would most stars be considered ""proton stars""?","For example, the Sun is a giant sphere of positively charged plasma. About 72% of the elements in it are protium. This means that these protium atoms would have had to lose their electrons, right? If so, the majority of the Sun would be protons. So just as there are neutron stars, would stars like our Sun be considered ""proton stars""?  This may be a stupid question, but what I'm really getting at is: are stars mostly protons? Is what I described how it all works? "
3099,periodic inclination change circumbinary planet,"I am studying circumbinary planets and I made a python model to calculate certain properties of the orbits, and when I calculate the inclination I get a sine wave.   I do not see a way to predict the shape of the curve in advance, despite it being a rather simple curve. Furthermore, when I plot the eccentricity of the orbit the frequencies of the curves do not align.  Would anyone know why it oscillates at this rate and amplitude?  And a side question, would anyone know some literature on the subject of circumbinary planets?    "
3100,Aphelion and the solstice,"We have just passed one of the solstices and are approaching aphelion.  The two events are close but not simultaneous.  There is no very obvious (to me) reason why the two should coincide or be close.  Is there a less obvious reason why they are close?  If so, is the gap closing, growing, or remaining approximately constant? "
3101,Is it possible that a ultra-large portion of the space we live in is already inside a black hole? How could we refute this?,"Trying to wrap my head around some concepts involving the very large gravitational fields of black holes, and what the gravitational gradients look like on a cosmic scale.  I'm familiar with the Great Attractor, and wondered if it were possible if the Milky Way and it's neighbors are already ""doomed"" to fall into whatever the anomaly is.    Per recommendation, I've moved the second half of my question to a new Question here: Assuming a sufficient amount of mass above the density threshold, does the actual concentration of the mass matter in creating a black hole?  Original Text:     Extrapolating further, I've heard that the actual density of a black hole (within the volume of the event horizon) is pretty low, on the order of thin atmosphere - does that mean that any sufficiently large volume of mass over that density is also a black hole? Or does the actual concentration within the event horizon matter?  "
3102,"If any object could become a black hole, could any object become a neutron star?","A black hole doesn't necessarily need to form from a star; theoretically, it could form from any extremely dense object. In fact, many astronomers differentiate certain black holes, like supermassive ones, from stellar ones (ones that form from stars).  However, could the same apply for neutron stars? Neutron stars only form because of the intense gravity during a star's collapse: electron capture is forced to happen, and the majority of the star becomes neutrons. Could this potentially happen to non-stellar objects, if the gravity forces electron capture?  If so, why don't we see as many of these ""neutron objects"" as we do non-stellar black holes? "
3103,Can someone tell me what is exactly the curvature per mile in earth?,Earth is a planet as we all know.Astronomy examine the planets too.So whats the point looking for answers on other planets if you cannot give an answer to a simple question like the following. Basic on [website]So any Astronomer lover can explain why i can see Mountains smaller than 500 Feet from a distance of 50 miles with my telescope???  So As i can see None can answer this simple Question.

3104,Low mass cut-off for the Dharma Planet Survey's detection of habitable planets around 40 Eridani A?,"News of the discovery of a potentially habitable planet around the star 40 Eridani A (about 16 light-years away) is interesting for reasons including a 1991 letter described below in Sky &amp; Telescope's recent article Super-Earth Discovered in (Fictional) Vulcan System, part of which is shown below.  Question: Is there any way to estimate a low mass cut-off for the Dharma survey for this particular star? Could there also be a 1 or 2 Earth mass planet there as well, within a habitable zone, as-yet undetected? Or does data there exclude this possibility?  The paper about the recent discovery: [website]  Almost three decades ago, Gene Roddenberry (producer of the Star Trek universe) wrote a letter to Sky &amp; Telescope, along with Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics astronomers Sallie Baliunas, Robert Donahue, and George Nassiopoulos. In their Letter to the Editor, they argued that 40 Eridani A — an orange-ish star 16 light-years away — would make the ideal home for Vulcan, the home planet of Science Officer Mr. Spock.      Now, a new discovery puts a little more science into that science fiction assertion.      A Long-ago Letter      In the July 1991 issue, the three astronomers and one movie-maker made the case for what star should be considered Vulcan's home:           The star around which Vulcan orbits was never identified in the original series or in any of the feature films based on it and so has never been officially established. But two candidates have been suggested in related literature.         Two Star Trek books named the star 40 Eridani A as Vulcan's sun, while another publication named Epsilon Eridani instead. However, Roddenberry and the astronomers made an argument for 40 Eridani A:           We prefer the identification of 40 Eridani as Vulcan's Sun because of what we have learned about both stars at Mount Wilson. . . . The HK [Project] observations suggest that 40 Eridani is 4 billion years old, about the same age as the Sun. In contrast Epsilon Eridani is barely 1 billion years old.         Based on the history of life on Earth, life on any planet around Epsilon Eridani would not have had time to evolve beyond the level of bacteria. On the other hand, an intelligent civilization could have evolved over the aeons on a planet circling 40 Eridani. So the latter is the more likely Vulcan sun. . . . Presumably Vulcan orbits the primary star, an orange main-sequence dwarf of spectral type K1. . . . Two companion stars — a 9th magnitude white dwarf and an 11th magnitude red dwarf — orbit each other about 400 astronomical units from the primary. They would gleam brilliantly in the Vulcan sky.  "
3105,Gas halo of our Milky Way Galaxy,"This question relates to a diffuse hot gas halo of our Milky Galaxy. I've read that there is a hot diffuse halo of gas surrounding our Galaxy (NED, Caltech)  I was wondering why such a halo can exist? Why doesn't it collapse to a disk shape? Is it because the gas itself is still hot and so remains largely unaffected by the Galaxy potential? "
3106,Is time itself speeding up universally?,"Time moves more slowly near a mass than in relatively empty space.  For example, I get that an observer would see someone falling into a black hole to appear to move more slowly and get ""stuck"" on the event horizon, while the falling body would see the observer as aging more rapidly.  Additionally, an observer watching a passenger craft moving near the speed of light (high mass equivalent) might see a passenger who tripped falling in slow motion, because the forward momentum of the passenger + the speed of the craft must never exceed the speed of light, while the passenger would experience no effect of this time dilation, and would simply trip and fall.  Which brings me to my question...  Black holes, even supermassive black holes, are nowhere near the mass of the universe as a whole; so when the universe itself was much smaller and far more dense, then at a universal scale time itself would have progressed more ""slowly"" than it does today, and since the expansion of the universe is accelerating, doesn't it mean that time is also accelerating?  (Assuming, of course, there was some ""outside"" to observe this from).  This is not a duplicate of Does time slow down because the universe is expanding at an accelerating rate?.  That question and its answers seem more concerned with local, relativistic time (which is as malleable as space itself).  My question asks more about the effect across a universal scale as it relates to density of mass across that same universal scale. "
3107,How does time dilation from a large body fall off?,A magnetic fields generally fall off as 1 / r^3 rather than 1 / r^2 for gravity. How does time dilation fall off from a large body?  Where would the gravity and magnetic field line be in this chart provided from comments?

3110,How can we focus radio telescopes on a star when the earth is spinning?,"Reading about the Star KIC 8462852, it has been said that the SETI project turned its radio telescopes towards the star to search for extra terrestrial radio signals as the star had strange fluctuations in light. How can we point from earth a radio telescope towards a star which is 1480 light years away whilst the earth is spinning at 1675 km/h and keep it focused or, in the case of a radio telescope, aligned in order to try and receive radio waves??

3112,Ejected planets during the early stages of the formation of the Solar System,"This is similar to a previously asked question, but I am just asking about theory rather than observational evidence. Assuming there were a much larger number of protoplanets in the early Solar System, what percentage of these would theoretically have been ejected (orbital velocity increased beyond escape velocity due to interaction) and what percentage would have been just moved out to a more distant orbit (say, in the Kuiper Belt or the Oort Cloud)? In other words, should we expect to find rocky worlds in the far outer Solar System that were formed inside the current radius of the asteroid belt? "

3115,Is a spotting scope or binoculars a better choice for astronomy?,"I'm interested in observing the moon and planets, and maybe some nebulae and star clusters.  I have a pair of binoculars:   Nikon OceanPro 7x50 binoculars (around \$300) Celestron 20x80 binoculars (around $100)   I'm looking at a step up, to 100mm. Specifically, I'm trying to choose between  25x100 binoculars (either a Celestron or an Orion) and a 100mm spotting scope.  The only reason I'm considering a spotting scope is that it has a magnification of 22-66x, compared to the binoculars' 25x. But I want to check if such high magnifications really work for astronomy.  Let's say I'm observing the full moon. What's the highest usable magnification, without resulting in too dim an image?  An Amazon review says that:     I have found that while the readability improves from 22x to about 38x   the resolution actually decreases after that and I never use it from   40-66x, there is no point. Maybe it would have been better to have   optimised it for 22-40x.   If the scope is limited to 40x in daytime use, I expect it to be worse at night, even observing the full moon.  I'm considering buying the scope only for the increased magnification over the binoculars, but if I end up using the scope only at 22x, it defeats the point of buying the scope in the first place. Should I stick with the binoculars? "
3116,Weight of a celestial body,How do astronomers find out the correct weight of a planet even though there isn't any direct means to weigh them? What technique do they use? Just curious! 
3117,Number of obscured AGN compared to unobscured AGN,"Urry and Padovani 1995 proposed a unified model for Active Galactic Nuclei, which has since been recognised as a good model for AGN. If AGN are randomly oriented, then I'd expect there to be more obscured AGN than unobscured, because there would be more orientations that would make us look through the sides, than along the axis:    Is this the case? In other words, how many obscured-type AGNs (Seyfert 1 or 2 Galaxies, radio galaxies, radio-quiet quasars, NLRs) are there, compared to unobscured AGN (BLRs, blazars, radio-loud quasars)? "
3118,"If the speed at which the universe contracts in reverse time decreases over time, then how did scientists arrive at a date for ""The Big Bang""?","If the speed at which the universe expands is constantly increasing (just like a derivative), then the opposite must also be true: the speed at which the universe contracts in reverse time is constantly decreasing, but, never reaches zero (like an asymptote).   If there is no exact point at which the speed of the contraction of the universe (in reverse time) reaches zero (because an asymptote goes on infinitely), then how did scientists arrive at a ""date"" for the ""big bang""?   Since the speed of the expansion of the universe will go on and on ad infinitum, how can one arrive at a specific beginning point of an infinite function?  "

3120,Potential Re-Capture of Rogue Planets,"Rogue planets can be designated as rogue planets due to one of two possible scenarios: 1) the ""rogue planet"" formed as a sub-brown dwarf, or 2) the planet was ejected from its home star system. I want to make it clear that here, I'm interested in objects of the second category - objects that are similar to the planets we find in our solar system.  Could a rogue planet, having been ejected from its home star system, be gravitationally re-captured by another star system? If so, would it be likely to disrupt other bodies in the stellar system (I know this depends on size; let's say that the rogue planet is a ""Hot Jupiter"")?  I realize that we don't know a whole lot about these objects (let's face it, we only know of a handful), so I'm not looking for examples, but any logical answers would be pretty helpful. "
3121,"Modeling planet rotations (time of day, obliqueness, etc.)","I created this solar system model using POV-Ray:    by following these instructions:  [website]The next thing I want to do is orient/rotate each globe correctly according to the time of day, time of year, obliqueness, position in its orbit, etc. but cannot find any instructions on the JPL website. How can I go about completing this task? Thanks.  Part Two  [deleted]  Part Three  So, &alpha; (right ascension), &delta; (declination) and W are Euler rotation angles. But what are the starting conditions before applying these rotations? Should the North Pole of the planet be aligned with the z-axis? Should the plane formed by the prime meridian be perpendicular to the y-axis?  Also, which axes do I rotate around, and in what order? I am guessing &delta; should be rotated first around the y-axis, then &alpha; around the z-axis. But W also looks like it should go around the z-axis. I am confused.  Part Four  I found another PDF document which on page 27 gives an equation for &delta;, &alpha; and W. (Not sure how to reproduce it here.)  [website]I think that according to that PDF file I need to rotate around the z-axis by W, around the x-axis by (90-&delta;), and around the z-axis again by (90+&alpha;), in that order. Lastly, an additional rotation (around the x-axis?) by 23.43928 degrees must be done to get the body out of the ICRF frame and into the ecliptic frame.  But I still don't know the starting conditions. I.e. before applying the transformations, should the globe's North Pole point upward? Should the intersection of the Prime Meridian and Equator lie along the x-axis? Or, am I totally wrong, and should I perform the inverse matrix calculations instead? So far I have not gotten results that match what I see in Celestia for the same Julian Date.  Part Five  In some instances I am able to get ""close"" results using the above method. In others not. For instance, Mars, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune are ""close"" to correct. (At least, the poles - the blue arrows - are pointing in the same directions.) The Earth is not.        The correct results are the ones in the larger Celestia program window. My current POV-Ray results are in the smaller window to the left. The dark arrows indicate the parent (ecliptic) reference frame. The bright arrows indicate the body reference frame. The view in all images is from the top down on to the ecliptic plane. "
3122,Selecting a Telescope for Viewing Planets,"I hope to observe planets like Jupiter and Saturn, and moons. I am a novice when it comes to telescopes and I know images in magazines are not taken with at least 12-inch telescope in a middle of nowhere. Is it possible to view Saturn in little yellowish and Mars in little reddish using following telescopes?  I am going to buy one of them. Which one is worth more for the money with the price difference?  I am living in Sri Lanka (a country close to the equator) in a suburban city.

3123,How are the gaps filled in images captured by CCD arrays?,"Large telescopes don't use a single CCD; they use arrays of them. Since CCDs can't be seamlessly joined, this means that every captured image must have gaps. But, the resulting images almost never have gaps when they are presented to the public.  How are these gaps filled? Does the telescope capture a number of overlapping images and then merge the results? Wouldn't this result in differing exposure levels for differing areas of the image, which, even though it could be compensated for in the processing, would give different noise characteristics to the different areas? "
3124,"Sedna, VP113 and the likelihood of the PX/Tyche/Thelistos hypotheses","Crosslisted question from [website]The recent discoveries in exoplanetary science (specially those findings of planets orbiting far far away from its parent star/stars) raise questions about how much we know about the (true, AIU definition) number of planets in our solar system.  Question: does the discovery of VP113 and Sedna increase the odds of some kind of planetary object in the edge of the known solar system (Oort's cloud)? How could we find it if it is very cold and dark? I mean, how many Sedna or VP113 objects we would need in order to guess its position and location?  Reading about this topic, I don't know how to quantify the odds of finding   PX(Planet X): An Earth sized body perturbing the orbits of Sedna, VP113 and other similar objects. Thelistos: A super-Earth (about 5-10 Earth masses times a O(1) factor) Tyche: (Now disfavoured by WISE data, I think it can not be excluded if it is extremely cold and ""dark"") Gas giant (Neptune-like, Saturn-like, etc) Nemesis: A ""dark star""/brown dwarf object.  "
3125,Infinite universe? How?,"So it seems the overall thought is that the universe is infinite. I don't get how.  Most depictions I read mention something to the effect of ""at 1^-20 seconds the universe was the size of _"". (Essentially mentioning a finite size at a very small length of time). So it came from a singularity, and had a finite size at some point. No matter how fast inflation went, any multiple of that finite size is NOT infinity though. If it was finite once, it is still finite.  If it's infinite then it was always infinite which means it was infinite density, infinitely large, etc. That's too crazy to swallow.  Isn't it more likely that the universe is really really big but not infinite? And we are at the center of the observable universe (to us), however we are off center in some grander universe that's maybe 1 trillion light years across? And nothing is past that because space and time are the same thing. Therefore if there is no light/matter/events, there is no time and hence no space. "
3126,"If we count Avogadro's Number of stars that are closest to Earth, how big that space would be?","I think that the answer to this question will be useful as a scale to appreciate the size of the universe.  So, If we count Avogadro's Number of stars that are closest to Earth, how big that space would be? And how many galaxies/clusters will be engulfed in that space? And for a start, let's just consider only three dimensions. "

3128,"Assuming a sufficient amount of mass above the density threshold, does the actual concentration of the mass matter in creating a black hole?","I've heard that the actual density of a black hole (within the volume of the event horizon) is pretty low - does that mean that any sufficiently large volume of mass over that density is also a black hole? Or does the actual concentration of mass within the event horizon matter?  Forked from ""Is it possible that a ultra-large portion of the space we live in is already inside a black hole? How could we refute this?"" "
3129,Q: Calculating the luminosity of a galaxy,"I am currently working on a project on which I am calculating the luminosity of galaxies by using the SDSS data. They use a system of asinh magnitudes, and according to their website they use a system of softening parameters as it follows in [website]I used their cmodel magnitude that they advise for galaxies' photometry. For example, I have the r magnitude of this galaxy that is 14.68, and I am trying to find its luminosity. They say that to convert to flux density, one must follow the following equation:   S = 3631 Jy * f/f0, where for the r band the AB conversion and shift is minimal.  However, when I plug the numbers into the equation:     The distance of the galaxy is 63.3 Mpc But it seems that when I plug the numbers, the final value does not match, how is that? And yes, I converted to the units including the Jansky to 10^-26 W m^-2 Hz^-1 and the Mpc to m.   I wish to find the luminosity of the galaxy in terms of solar luminosity and I know that one solar luminosity unit is the same as 3.827e+26 W.   I was only able to find the correct answer when I did the following equation:     Where:    If anyone knows what I am doing wrong point out, please. Is it because flux intensity is different from flux?  "
3130,How do I find the RA of sunset and sunrise in a specific location?,I want to make some observations with a telescope in Hawaii on Mauna Kea but I am living somewhere else (not Hawaii) and I want to plan a night's viewing on the Hawaiian telescope. How do I find the RA range of the night? In other words; how do I find the RA range of the first object observable to the latest object observable for a particular time (of year) for a specific location (in this case Hawaii)? 
3131,How is space-time bent by black holes?,"I just read When a star becomes a black hole, does its gravitational power become stronger? and it confused me a bit;  I always thought black holes are supermassive and that is why they bend space-time. But it is said therein that the black hole is less massive than the star that created it (and it seems logical if we think about that - indeed, the star exploded and released a lot of matter).   Thus my question: How can a black hole bend space-time more than the star which created it? "
3132,Can we conclude with reasonable certainty that there is/are no Type 3 Civilizations in our galaxy?,"As per the Kardashev Scale, type-3 civilizations are defined as ""civilization(s) in possession of energy on the scale of its own galaxy, with energy consumption at ~ 4 x 10^44 erg/sec"". Considering that we have detected none, despite projects like SETI - can we conclude with reasonable certainty that there is ""currently"" no type-3 civilization in the milky way? Or Is it perhaps possible that there could be such civilization(s) primarily harnessing dark matter / energy and hence gone undetected?   I am assuming there could yet be type-2 civilizations that extract fusion energy (""normal/known"" sources of energy), information, and raw-materials from multiple solar systems - within our own galaxy - yet undetected. "
3133,How can we map masses orbiting the outer Solar System by determining the orbits of planets and smaller objects?,"Neptune was discovered 170 years ago with the help of observations of Uranus' orbit. A great demonstration of the scientific principle for its time. Recently, Earth and cis-Lunar based radio interferometry together with the Cassini orbiter have measured Saturn's orbit, 10 AU from the Sun, with very great precision. This has already helped determine some characteristics of a possible planet Nein 200-700 AU from here.  What would be the best way to gravitationally measure the yet unobserved mass concentrations in the Kuiper Belt and beyond, by observing orbits of objects among the known planets?  It takes alot to move Saturn to a measurable degree. What about a space probe with the sole purpose of being easy to locate at high precision, maybe in a highly inclined orbit? Or a family of them in different directions. Would its deplacement from the very weak gravity well of a planet Nine be detectable? If it is the history of Saturn that contributes crucially to the precision, what about an asteroid like Ceres which is known since 200+ years? Is there any special property of Saturn that makes it especially useful? Would a second object as well measured as Saturn be extra helpful by some kind of triangulation of distant gravitational influences? "
3134,Tools for creating a multiwavelength view of the sky,"Not sure that this is the correct place to ask this question, but here goes.  I am trying to find tools to accumulate image data (preferably in FITS format) on a given (RA, Dec)-coordinate of sky. Right now there are several image services that offer cutouts, for example:   irsa.ipac.caltech.edu holds data from Spitzer, Planck, WMAP, IRAS, WISE hla.stsci.edu holds Hubble Space Telescope data skyserver.sdss.org/dr7/en/tools/chart/list.asp holds SDSS data etc.   I wonder if anyone has written any code for accumulating these images given an argument of RA and Dec? Or if they can point me in the right direction of tools that they know exist? Any help would be appreciated. "
3135,What is star composition after formation,"Most descriptions of star ignition go something like... The star reaches a critical mass and ignites, blowing away the surrounding material. The most obvious question would be ""Why are stars not all the same size?"", given that the critical mass for ignition would appear to be the same, but I understand that stars can accumulate mass from collisions from other stars, planetary bodies etc.   So my question is also based on the fact that larger stars also burn more energetically, I assume blowing away more of the the lighter elements from the surrounding cloud after formation and gathering more heavy elements,... do larger stars have a significantly different composition from smaller stars? --- or is the simple description of star formation misleading? "
3136,"In km/h, what actually is the ""speed"" of Andromeda away from us: cosmologically?","Andromeda is about 2.5 million ly away.  Actually, in this universe, at what ""speed"" (in km/h) are two objects separating cosmologically - I mean strictly due to the ""expansion of the universe"" - if they are 2.5 million ly apart?  I do understand that local ""ordinary"" or ""peculiar"" motion completely swamps this effect.  If I'm not mistaken, the ""local"" ""ordinary"" motion of Andromeda per our galaxy happens to be about 400,000 km/h towards us.  Is the ""speed"" due to the ""expansion of the universe"" drastically smaller than this?    I assumed that the expansion of the universe (or ""of the spacetime metric"") is even everywhere: it's well known that it only affects ""the largest structures"" but I still assumed that the expansion is the same in my room, my galaxy, my cosmological region.  Perhaps this assumption is totally wrong? "
3137,Fitting PSF to an image to get total flux (Python),"I have an image of a single unsaturated source (asteroid) that I'd like to fit guesses for various model PSFs to, so that I can then compare the total flux in each case. I've only recently begun studying PSFs, so I am a bit confused.   I know that astropy offers a package called photutils.psf which does the PSF fitting for you, but I would like to better understand what's going on behind the fitting, and how the flux of the source is resolved from it. Furthermore, when I tried using this package, I wasn't getting any outputs anyway (it said a source was found, but that it didn't meet the sharpness or roundness criteria, despite me changing those parameters around quite a bit). I have tried something simpler below (where model_data is the 2d numpy array representation of the PSF, and img is the asteroid image data):  import numpy as np from astropy.modeling import fitting from photutils import FittableImageModel  y, x = np.mgrid[:np.shape(img)[0], :np.shape(img)[1]]  fitter = fitting.LevMarLSQFitter() model2d = FittableImageModel(model_data) result = fitter(model2d, x, y, img) print(result) print(np.median(img), np.max(img), np.sum(img))   The output I get is then:  flux       x_0       y_0  -----     -----     -----  9282.784  466.44    531.69   2705.82 25301.56 980812434.98  However, these are not the correct centroid coordinates of the source in the image. The correct coordinates are around (300, 300). Also, to get this result, the PSF data was normalized so that the max intensity point is 1. But when I change this normalization so that the total flux (sum of all the pixels) is 1, the result for the flux after fitting I get is way higher.  I'm not sure what's happening behind the scenes here (I got lost in the documentation), and I'm not sure if I can trust any of these flux values, considering the x_0 and y_0 are always off. So I'd like to better understand -- how exactly does one find the flux of an object by fitting it to a PSF? And how should that PSF be normalized? "
3138,Unable to locate Big Dipper through Polar Axis Finder,"I have recently purchased a CG-4 Polar Axis Finder for my CG-4 mount.   This PAF has markings on the lens for aligning with Big Dipper or Cassiopeia, which looks like this:   I have aligned the PAF to the mount during the day, and I am now attempting to use it at night. My understanding is that I need to rotate the mount in RA to match the image in the PAF to the actual stars in either Big Dipper or Cassiopeia. This will give me the correct position to then re-target at Polaris to find NCP.  I have been trying for 2 nights, and still no luck! The Big Dipper and Cassiopeia are in front of me - I can see them very clearly with the naked eye. Yet when I look through the PAF, I cannot see any star patterns resembling either of my targets. There are stars, but it's like the magnification is too high, maybe? No stars forms the pattern I am looking for, in any orientation. I cannot derive the connection between what I see with the naked eye right in front of me, and what I see through the PAF. I understand that the image in the PAF will be mirrored vertically and horizontally - still no luck. I can easily find my target through the Finder Scope on my main tube, but not through the PAF.  I have devised an experiment. I have positioned my tripod under a power line running high above me. I have aligned my view at Alkaid (western tip of the Big Dipper handle) with the wire, so I can see it in the PAF. Good news - I can see it in the PAF, and I can see Alkaid (it's the brightest in the area, so I am fairly sure that I can use it as a reference point between what I see with the naked eye and what I see through the PAF).   Bad news - no matter how I rotate my mount in RA while keeping the handle tip aligned with Alkaid, there's nothing that matches the rest of Big Dipper...  What is going on? I can't even explain this with a  ""Defective PAF Theory""... "
3139,Which kind of properties can we get for cosmic ray particles hitting on an optical ccd?,"It is very common that we meet cosmic ray particles in optical images recorded by CCDs. You can see the ""snowflakes"" in the hubble images below:   Generally we should remove them in order to get photometry or spectroscopic info.  However, there may be useful info we can derive, for example, can we get their directions or energies statistically before they arrive at a CCD?  There is some correlation between the ADU value of a cosmic ray point and its real energy? "
3140,Astrophysical Jet Size?,"I am wondering about what is the estimated size of astrophysical jet that shoots out from a black hole, I don’t know if it is determined by the size of a black hole.  What would classify a black hole that is able to have at least 10 planets orbit it? Is it considered stellar?  If so, what would the estimated astrophysical jet or quasar be? "
3141,Identify Greek letters used in formulas,"Could anyone tell me what the names of the Greek letters in the screenshot are? Is the first one alpha? They are used in calculating ICRF rotations. Wikipedia uses a different font for their list of characters, so it's hard to tell.   "
3142,A black hole that doesn't take in matter?,"According to List of Common Misconceptions by Wikipedia, under the heading of astronomy, this line can be found:      A black hole can act like a ""cosmic vacuum cleaner"" and pull a   substantial inflow of matter, but only if the star it forms from is   already having a similar effect on surrounding matter.   This is referenced to a paper written in Yale university:  ""Frontiers And Controversies In Astrophysics Transcript 9"", although that's a dead link. By linking so, I believe that it is a reliable source.  This got me thinking that is there a black hole that doesn't suck in surrounding matter? And is there a star that don't take in surrounding matter? "
3143,Why do galaxies have arms?,"A couple of years ago I started playing a game called Kerbal Space Program (KSP) and my understanding about how orbits actually work increased dramatically. Because of KSP I was looking at a picture of a galaxy with its spiral arms and something struck me as very odd. The stars closer in should orbit the galaxy center faster than the stars farther out and that would smear out these lanes of stars until they were no longer recognizable. Something weird is going on here!  So why do galaxies have arms? What's bunching these stars together like that?  I noticed that the center of galaxies are all smeared out and bulbous like I think that the rest should look like. So what if all that mass rotating around a common center is warping space around it, like the water draining down your sink, and this warping is what catching matter/stars into the lanes. "
3144,"What are the biggest problems about the numerical, finite-element GR models?","As I know, for example the modelling of the collapse of a neutron star (to a black hole) wasn't done correctly until now.  Why? Yes, I know, the Einstein Field Equations aren't really easy to solve. But, for example, the situation is very similar in the case of the QCD, but there are already fruitful results existing ( [website]Is there any theoretical obstacle in the way? Or we simply didn't have enough fast computers/physicist/programmer manyear until now? "
3145,Can an SMBH recycle dark matter into energy?,"I just had a conceptual question, hopefully it makes for some really interesting answers.   I was wondering, as most galaxies have an SMBH at their centre (see Kormandy &amp; Richstone 1995; Richstone et al. 1998), could dark matter accrete onto the SMBH over time (perhaps perturbed by a galaxy collision, interaction or merger) and then recycle this matter as energy? Can dark matter help an SMBH grow?    "
3146,"Where does the energy of light go, when it red-shifts?","When talking about the expansion of the universe, it is said that it can be proven by the red-shifting of light.(As we would need higher than lightspeed to get this redshift by the Doppler effect)  I am an amateur, so I am not sure I am correct, but here is what I think.  Redshifting increases the wavelength of the light. higher wavelength = lower frequency = less energy.  So, if my assumptions are correct, where does this energy from the light go? If not, where did I make an incorrect assumption? "
3147,Is Rosetta changing the theory of comets?,"Rosetta is now arriving at Comet 67P.   Other comets have been analyzed to some degree (Giotto, Deep Space 1, Deep Impact, etc.)  So my question is... where I can study the up-to-date theory of comets? Much of what was previously thought (eg. dirty snowball) has been discarded now, but I haven't found a good source describing the current thinking.   Are there any firm predictions that will be tested as Rosetta studies the comet up close?  "
3148,Does the Milky Way orbit around anything?,"We know most of the objects in the Universe have a spherical or elliptical shape. The object which has less mass and gravitational pull orbits around the nearest object with more mass and gravitational pull. For example:   Moon orbits around Earth Earth orbits around Sun Sun orbits around Sagittarius A* which is the center of Milky Way.   Thus, is the Milky Way orbiting around some object or perhaps Black Hole?  I know that the Milky Way is going towards Andromeda as they are attracting each other and they will collide with each other after 3 billion years to 6 billion years. But it is possible that the Milky way is orbiting around some object at the same time? Perhaps both galaxies are present in a group of galaxies which is orbiting around some object.   If the Milky Way is not orbiting around some object then is there any proof found by the scientists for that?  "
3149,Expansion of the Universe,"Please forgive my ignorance. I dare say that these questions arise from me trying to understand the nature of the Universe using Newtonian physics. There are a few things that really bother me when topics such as red shift and expansion are discussed.   1) We can view a Galaxy that is 30bn light years away because the light we are seeing it as it was 13bn years ago, and at that time it was only 13bn light years away. So, it has travelled 17bn years further in the last 13bn years? Faster than the speed of light?  2) 13bn years ago, it was 13bn light years away. That is around the time of the big bang. How did it manage to get that far away so soon after the Universe began.   3) How is the known Universe even as big as 40bn light years, after only 13bn years in existence.  "
3150,Where asteroids disappear,"Scientists claim that objects left on the Moon can lie hundreds of years in the same condition like astronaut Charles Duke family photo. Why we don't see remains of asteroids inside or around craters? Are asteroids going destroyed on impact or go under the surface even without any residue? Why do we not see asteroids that hit  Moon with a small force and remained on the surface for hundreds of years like astronaut's photo? Can craters form for other reasons? For example, from underground collapse? "
3151,Did cosmological inflation occur at speeds greater than $c$?,"If cosmological inflation occurred at speeds less than [tex], wouldn't we see the CMB right in front of our noses (or not at all) instead of at 13.7 billion light years? And if it happened faster than [tex], does that mean inflation occurred before the current laws of physics (read the four basic forces) precipitated, was [tex] greater then than it is now? "
3152,What is the scale of things you can see with gravitational lensing?,"I'm trying to understand the examples of gravity lensing (using the general relativity property of large masses to bend light like a lens).   Most of the examples I see are of some galaxy (presumably a large mass) between us and a star (or are at least vague enough to not specify.  Yet my intuitive understanding of the sky is that all the stars we see are relatively close, all entirely within the Milky Way galaxy (and many of the stars in our galaxy provide a general glow), and that other galaxies are far enough away that it is difficult to image individual stars. The only single objects large enough comparable to a galaxy would be a quasar. Is that right?  So what then is going on usually with examples of gravity lensing? I find it hard to believe the captions that say a galaxy is enabling seeing more distant stars. I would think one could only apply that concept to a star or galaxy to see something much further away and as big or much bigger. Could one really use a galaxy as a lens to see a star? I wouldn't expect a star to be behind a galaxy from us.  Also, whatever the objects themselves, what is the scale? If the lensing is of a galaxy done by a star, I'd expect the star to galaxy distance ratio to be well below 1:1000 (~width of Milky Way to distance to Andromeda). But for galaxy to galaxy or galaxy cluster to galaxy or quasar lensing what are the likely relative distances? "
3153,"the length of second, minute or hour, what defines the time of exo planetary bodies","we measure time based on earth and earth mass\gravity plays a role in the measurement ? so how and what would be time if not earth time on other exo planets since they will be having different mass/gravity and probably more variables affecting time measurement.  I can say Gliesa has a day of 30 hrs(assumed) ,   So will the length of second, minute and hour, likeewise day or month will fall under its own time system? "
3154,How can I estimate the M/L ratio from a fitted SED on a galaxy?,"This answer (here in the forum) provides background to my question: [website]I am trying to understand the process in which a stellar population synthesis (SPS) is created, in order to calculate the stellar mass of a galaxy. (This is my main goal: understand how the stellar mass is calculated via SPS and broadband photometry)(Section 2.5:  [website]Ok. I have already understood the process to obtain a stellar population library (SPL). Such SPL will be fitted to observational data in order to create a SED (Spectral Energy Distribution)  Ok. Now I have the fitted SED on a galaxy, here are my questions:   How can I estimate the M/L ratio of that galaxy? How can I estimate the L?   I feel it is an easy and direct answer, but I don't get it.  "
3155,Is there enough hydrogen left after a star dies so another star will have enough to light up?,"A star consumes quite a lot of hydrogen in its life, and is pretty much ""vacuuming"" everything in its vicinity. After it dies (eventually by supernova which will spread all its composition over light years), is there enough hydrogen left in that area to light up a new star? And will that star be more short-lived compare to its predecessor? "
3156,How was an infrared picture of the entire universe taken?," (click to enlarge)  How was this picture of the supposed entire universe taken in infrared? Also, why does it seem as though almost all of the matter is in a line formation over the center? It makes sense why most matter would be concentrated in the center, but why is it in a line? "
3157,Why Did The Universe Expand?,"If all of the mass and energy in the universe was in a point smaller than the size of an electron at one time, why did it expand? Did it necessarily expand immediately on formation, or could it have remained in an initial state for some length of time until some phase threshold was reached? "
3158,Techniques to find dark matter,"What are recent research techniques to find Dark matter? As they don't interact with other matters, which properties of it can help us to detect it?  "
3159,Why are (Type II) supernovae so bright?,"The vast majority of energy from a supernova is emitted as neutrinos and high-energy radiation, both of which being invisible to the naked eye. Yet a supernova can outshine its galaxy in the visible spectrum for weeks.  How is a supernova generating so much visible light that nuclear fusion pales in comparison? What is the ratio of visible and invisible energy emitted by a supernova, and how does it compare to stars' normal operation? "
3160,Is Digital Adaptive Optics Possible?,"Adaptive optics generally apply slight changes to mirrors to account for atmospheric turbulence. These generally require either a mirror to be broken up into smaller mirrors, each with their own actuator, or for a single large mirror to be slightly deformed by many different actuators.  Is it possible to do much of this digitally?   Couldn't software slightly attenuate or amplify each pixel at each time-slice collected from a passive mirror? These changes would depend on the distortions measured by a guide star or laser (this digital system would still require a guiding light)? I suspect this would probably be less accurate than true adaptive optics, but it would also be far less expensive (as you wouldn't need so many actuators).  Has this approach been studied and dropped? Is it ridiculous and not even theoretically possible? I'm curious if anything has researched this idea. "
3161,Terran eclipse?,"Solar and lunar eclipses are pretty straightforward. But what about eclipses when you are standing on the Moon? I have been trying to Google the info, but there's some gaming clan that has taken the name ""terran eclipse"" so it's hard to find the real stuff.  I was able to find this article on lunar eclipse from the Moon (the Earth eclipsing the sun). But what about the other way - a solar eclipse observed from the Moon? What would Earth look like? Would anything special be happening on the Moon? "
3162,Software to convert RA and DEC into ALT and AZ,"I have implemented the formulas to convert AR and Dec into altitude and Azimuth in C++ following the book Practical Astronomy with your Calculator or Spreadsheet 4th Edition.  In the book there is an example to check if I have do it fine. This example works perfectly but I want to check if my formulas are correct.  I have use this page to check it but I get different minutes values in both altitude and azimuth values.  I have checked on that page that I get the same LST value, but ALT and AZ have different values. This data I have tested:  Altitude: -15° 27' 40"" Azimuth:  273° 12' 34""   This is the data get it from that page:   Do you know if there is another web page or program to check if the result of my formulas are correct?  UPDATE: I have tried to get Azimuth and Altitude using a date in year 2000 in web page and my program and this is the result (you can find my program's result at the bottom of the image):   Is this the same problem like the previous one (I'm not taking account for precession)? "
3163,"Throughout the year, are all parts of the night sky visible from any given point on Earth?","Or are there points on Earth where certain parts of the 360° night sky are never visible throughout the whole year?    Depending on the answer to this question, are there points on Earth where parts of the celestial sphere as such are never in the sky, no matter if it's a day or night sky? "
3164,Attach a visible light telescope to the outside of the ISS,"Visible light imaging of the heavens is limited on Earth primarily due to the atmosphere. I know the ISS is moving at 17000mph, but given the delays to the James Webb telescope, is there any merit in attaching a space-rugged visible light telescope to the outside of the ISS? Could it ever approach the visible light performance of Hubble? "
3165,"How (un)stable are the Lagrangian points 1, 2 and 3?","A couple questions, please: I know that the Lagrangian points 1, 2 and 3 are unstable and special Lissajous orbits plus some station-keeping are required to place a spacecraft around them. But I was wondering if they are so totally unstable that they can't temporarily ""capture"" a passing natural object (let's say an asteroid or a cloud of cosmic dust, in a stationary way or entering some kind of not-very-stable orbit around them)? Or could they?  And if they were able to, how much time would (approximately) be required for this/these object(s) to go ""off-orbit"" and abandon the L(1,2,3) area? In the case of the cloud of cosmic dust, would it just slowly (or quickly) drift away, or would they be ""launched"" towards another direction or orbit?  Thanks in advance!  "
3166,What type of energy is escaping from black-hole's poles?,"Following this article, it is stated that:      As a star drifts too close to a supermassive black hole, intense tidal   stresses rip the star to shreds. As this happens, the shredded   material will be dragged into the black hole’s accretion disk — a hot   disk of gas that is gradually pulled into the black hole’s event   horizon, bulking up the black hole’s mass or blasted as energetic   jets from its poles.   Questions are,    What is the energy type that escapes from the poles?  What is the magnitude of the power?  Can this energy be potentially harnessed?  How far into space do these energy jets blow?   Also, if you feel like discussing this: if mass m goes into the black hole and comes out as energy E from the poles, assuming the speed of light c has no play in this transaction of going in or out, what happened to [tex] from ? Could a black hole be hypothetically faster than light? Or maybe the reverse direction of light? (I even got confused from this thought...)  So, if those jets are not pure energy, but are energized matter,    What type/kind of matter it would be? (gas? solid? liquid?) Is all the matter that comes in, also goes out? I am thinking if the black hole works like a car's engine - does it have conversion efficiency?  Can this matter be cultivated, harnessed, or converted back to what it was or something new all together?   .  This question is presented here after it was asked on the space stackexchange. I want to leave it there because it has some relevant discussion to this question overall. "
3167,Why isn't the star that created the black hole a black hole?,"If the mass of a black hole is creating so much gravity that light cannot escape, why isn't the mass of the star that created the black hole (before it went supernova) trapping light as well?  By all accounts, that pre-supernova star should have boatloads more mass than the black hole post supernova, right?  Doesn't the star lose most of it's mass when going supernova? "
3168,Are high-speed galactic collisions survivable?,"This is a hypothetical question, but it really is meant as a vivid way of asking about the affects of high-speed galactic collisions. The November 27 APOD showed the Cheshire Cat galaxy group, and the caption says that the ""eyes"" are two large elliptical galaxies, closing on one another at over 1000 km/s, and bathed in a glow of X-rays from heating of the associated interstellar media.  How intense is this glow? I suspect it is very faint, but I don't know how to quantify it. Would it hinder X-ray astronomy for residents of the galaxies? Would it be strong enough to affect life? Does anybody have quantitative information and know how to interpret it? (I do realize that elliptical galaxies are thought to be made up of old, low-metallicity stars that aren't good candidates for habitable planets, but let's ignore that.) "
3169,Erratic Sundial,My sundial shows real time until 11am when it will drop behind an hour until sunset. This is in keeping with daylight saving but why does it show real time before 11am? Am I missing something elementary? 
3170,Alignment of Semi-Major Axis of Orbits,"So I'd like to ask whether the semi-major axis of planetary orbits are aligned? Logically, they shouldn't be, but many websites act as if they are. If they're not aligned, what's the angle between the reference xy axis and the semi-major axis of the orbits of planets?  Thanks! "
3171,Is there matter forming in the inflationary space?,"Following the answers and the line of thinking from here Is there enough hydrogen left after a star dies so another star will have enough to light up?  I was wondering if is there any possibility to know if, where new space is created between the galaxies, is there also created any kind of new matter ( i.e. hydrogen, or subatomic particles that could eventually form atoms, which will lead to forming new stars and galaxies ) ?

3172,Validity of ephemeris time,"In the wikipedia article for epmeris time as first adopted in 1952, it does not explain clearly how or why it was supersed ed. For example, it reads:     In 1976 the IAU resolved that the theoretical basis for its current   (1952) standard of Ephemeris Time was non-relativistic, and that   therefore, beginning in 1984, Ephemeris Time would be replaced by two   relativistic timescales intended to constitute dynamical timescales:   Terrestrial Dynamical Time (TDT) and Barycentric Dynamical Time   (TDB).[28] Difficulties were recognized, which led to these being in   turn superseded in the 1990s by time scales Terrestrial Time (TT),   Geocentric Coordinate Time GCT(TCG) and Barycentric Coordinate Time   BCT(TCB).[16]   So, from this it appears that ephemeris time was never superceded and it continues to be evolved with a different theoretical basis?  From reading Robert Newton's books such as ""Ancient planetary observations and the validity of ephemeris time"", it would seem that ephemeris time is invalid because of non-secular accelerations in the motion of Mercury and Venus.  So, I guess my question is: does current astronomical theory consider ephemeris time to be invalid or valid, and if it considers it to be valid, then what is current evaluation of Newton's calculations and their implications for the validity of ephemeris time?

3173,Multiple apparent lunar eclipses last night,"I saw something very strange last night that I'm hoping someone can help me explain. I was sitting on my roof with a night-cap at about 3am last night. The moon, about the last quarter, was low in the sky in the east. Something truly strange happened. The moon started to disappear. There were clouds in the sky, but it wasn't this, I'm quite sure. The moon was being eclipsed. The dark part (at the top of the moon, as the moon was lying on its back - a sailor moon? That's what it looked like, like you could sit in it.) grew, the crescent closed, until it was just a spot of cream colored light and then winked out entirely.  I was a bit amazed - I'd stumbled onto my roof in the dead of the night and by complete chance witnessed a total lunar eclipse? I sat there in awe, staring. That's when the moon started to reappear, in the reverse procedure as its disappearance. Becoming a gleaming point of light, then a thin crescent, then the quarter moon which I suppose is what it is ""supposed to look like.""  AND THEN IT HAPPENED AGAIN. The moon was eclipsed and revealed again.  Both times the whole process took about 6-10 minutes. I'm not sure if this cycling continued, it was late and I had to sleep. I checked the NASA site for eclipses for my time and location, but no.  Has anyone ever seen anything like this, or have any plausible explanation as to what is going on here? "
3174,"How does the Moon move in the ""night"" sky as seen from the poles?","A photo in the NYTimes article Ice Surveys and Neckties at Dinner: Here’s Life at an Arctic Outpost has got me thinking.  During the winter months at either the north or south pole, when it is constantly dark, how does the Moon behave?   Would a nearly-full moon sometimes circle for days without setting, or would it still rise and set, or would it be all together missing, or some combination of all of the above?   "
3175,Can we simulate Earth's gravity in space?,"Earth gravity is 9.8 [tex]   Gravity on ISS(international space station) is 8.2 [tex] approx.   As per this [website]My question:  Can we create artificial gravity on ISS by using centrifugal force? [Have anyone watched ""The martian""? they have used this technique] "
3176,How certain are we about the universe's flatness?,"The universe is thought to be flat: [tex]. As I understand it we can determine this by measuring triangles against the CMB.    Yet during inflation dark energy made the universe grew much larger than the radiation universe, of which the CMB is the limit. Isn't it possible then that at the ""smaller"" scale of our visible universe it appears flat, but at the universe's full size it's curved? A bit like a square of 1 meter sides on the surface of the earth also looks flat, while at larger scale the earth is curved.  What are the chances that the 1% uncertainty could lead us to a universe with [tex]? "
3177,Can quantum entanglement cause nucleosynthesis to happen in stars?,"Even if there isn't enough heat and energy in the star to cause nucleosynthesis, could atoms quantum entangle to create a new atomic nuclei? Or would it be quantum tunneling - if this is possible? "
3178,Would bagging an asteroid destroy valuable science about it?,"NASA has a plan called ""Asteroid Redirect Mission option A"". It would robotically put an asteroid of a few meters diameter in a bag and push it into reach of astronauts for thorough examination. 44 tonnes of meteorites falls on Earth every day and almost 50,000 meteorites have been found on Earth. So the unique advantage of capturing a pristine asteroid, however tiny, is that it will not have been deformed by entering Earth's atmosphere. It might be a rubble pile and/or its surface might be covered by regolith or maybe even volatiles since it might have formed and always existed in microgravity. Even the Moon is covered by hoovering electrically charged dust near above its surface, ionized by cosmic or Solar radiation. And surface properties are important because it is only the surface which can be observed by telescopes and Earth based radar.  But wouldn't bagging and pushing an asteroid destroy such delicate surface and rubble pile properties? "
3179,Appropriate battery for overnight viewing to drive telescope and GOTO?,"I have a Plettstone 18"" Dobsonian telescope with GOTO and clock drive that runs off a 12 volt cigarette lighter adapter.  What is an appropriate battery to use to run this overnight while viewing all night long and then charge during the day for the following night's use?  In the past I've used deep cycle lead acid batteries, but these are heavy and can fail if not carefully maintained with a float charge.  Also, I don't need cranking power of a car, just sustained energy to drive the scope.  A typical Optima YellowTop deep cycle is rated 75 ampHours.  I don't know what the draw in Amps of my telescope is, but imagine it is less than an amp.  I've also seen these Battery Tender Lithium Iron Phosphate types but wonder if their 10-12 ampHour rating is enough and whether they are meant to be drained over a whole night?  Some say if you get below 8 volts the battery becomes broken, but I doubt the telescope would still run at such a low voltage.  What would a reasonable ampHour rating be?  What kind of battery is a good fit for astronomy equipment overnight? "
3180,How could lithium burning take place in a quasi-star?,"According to Begelman et al. (2008), one of the most distinguishing features of the hypothetical quasi-star is that it's supported by radiation pressure from the accretion disk of the black hole in its core. The paper suggests that these stars form from Population III stars.  What's more, while almost all of the star's luminosity is from the accretion disk (which is far more luminous than thermonuclear reactions), temperatures around the central black hole are hot enough for fusion:     Although we do not model the non-hydrostatic region of quasi-stars in any detail, in our case high temperatures are attained in the immediate vicinity of the black hole. However, even in this region the neglect of nuclear reactions is justified, first because black hole accretion is energetically much more efficient than fusion, and secondly because on-going accretion limits the time-scale over which inflowing gas is exposed to high [tex].   That's all fine, but what surprised me is the footnote on the third page:     In the most massive quasi-stars, the central temperature may be high enough (a few million K) to initiate lithium burning. This is energetically negligible, and although the presence or absence of lithium does affect the opacity, the effect is small for the photospheric temperatures and densities of interest here.   Even though this part dismisses lithium burning as an important factor, since it's energy output doesn't compare to that of the accretion disk's, it still mentions that lithium burning can take place. Considering that these form from Population III stars, how is it that much lithium burning can happen in the first place?  Although lithium is a relatively light atom, it is considered a metal and lithium burning depletes the amount of lithium in a star. Since Population III stars are supposed to be nearly metal-free, shouldn't only hydrogen or helium fusion be a factor here, even if they only have a small effect? "
3181,Is a Gas Giant a Perpetual Motion Machine?,"I know there's no such thing like a perpetual motion machine but I missing something in my reasoning.  Assume there's a gas giant planet where the immense pressure of the core causes it to heat and create a convection current of its gases. If there's no atmosphere gases losses to space that means we have a perpetual motion machine?  Is work being done to move all that gas (or not?). The energy to compress gases is coming from gravity but the total energy of the system remains the same?  Now assume some heat is being dissipated in space, that means the system is losing energy.  Can this possible go forever or will the planet reach a equilibrium where all gases and heat will be distributed in a way the convection cease? Or even can possible it loss energy enough to loss mass (and cease the heavy gravity effects)?  Bonus: Consider we got two kinds of life forms: one breathing XY and exhaling X+Y and another doing the inverse and using the heat from some (goldilock zone) atmosphere layer (some kind of XY + Energy => X + Y, X + Y + Energy => XY cycle). Will life perse consume the energy and cooldown the planet (eventually in billions years)?  Edit  There's a bit of confusing about this question due to my difficult in express my doubts. Sure it's impossible to achieve total ""isolation"". I'm just pondering about an hypothetical scenario. I see now the forever convection is just equivalent to a frictionless object spinning foerever in the void.  Any energy removed from the system will ""slow down"" it.  The true question is: What if the energy of this isolated system is used to fuel life and this life is inside the system and is part of the system? It still means energy is lost? "
3182,Regression line in a colour-colour diagram,"A colour-colour diagram (CCD) like this  compares the difference in magnitudes at different wavelengths. The trend in the pattern of colour-colour comparisons tells us about what type of source the light comes from.  Is there any significance in the best-fit line of the trend? As in, if I did a linear regression of the left plot above, I'd get a gradient of (V-R)/(B-V). I realise that this ratio doesn't have any physical significance in terms of a single source, but is there any value in calculating the best fit line and its slope or regression coefficient? Does it tell us anything about the group of sources it's associated with, or is it just used to calibrate filters, as it states on Wikipedia? The answer to this question doesn't really answer mine. "
3183,Are we sure there are no planets inside Mercury's orbit?,"Currently, most explorations about new planets are pointing to area outside Neptune's orbit, but how about inside Mercury orbit? Can we say for certain there are no planets inside Mercury's orbit? "
3184,"What effect does Earth losing a part of its mass have, is there an impact on the Earth's orbit around the Sun?","This is a random question that popped into my mind. I'm not a physicist or astronomist, however, I am genuinely curious. Also, this is not intended as a science fiction question, but an actual science question.  I had doubts about where this question should be posted - the Astronomy or the Physics SE page, in the end, I decided to post it here.  Sub-questions that I have, all being closely related to the one in the title:   Do the liftoffs of spaceships have any impact on Earth's orbit? As negligible as they might be? Every bit of mass lost (sent into space) decreases the gravity of our planet, as tiny as the change might be. Is that correct? Could the loss of Earth's mass over time (Hypothetically - centuries in the future, with tens of thousands of spaceships having left Earth.) change the orbit of Earth or produce any side-effects?  "
3185,Why do certain massive stars leave no remnants?,"Mass and metallicity are the two main determinants for a star's fate. This is simple enough. What's more complicated is how exactly these determine the star's fate. For example, you can see in this image I got from Wikipedia's supernova article:   Generally, as metallicity decreases and mass increases, black holes become more likely to form. At a specific mass and metallicity range, however, there are no remnants left behind. From that point, increasing mass and decreasing metallicity allows for black holes again.  How does this work? Why would there ever be an area in which no remnants are left behind? In fact, it seems almost random, since the range lies right between direct black hole ranges. "
3186,"Auroras: is there any bump in frequency at certain times of night, or times of year?","I'm trying to find out if there is a range of times at night, and/or days during the year, in which the probability of seeing an aurora is higher than average.   The aurora section of the British Astronomical Association asserts that there's  a correlation with season (higher probability near equinoxes), and a correlation with 'magnetic midnight'.  [website]Are these assertions correct? If so, what is the definition of magnetic midnight, exactly? "
3187,"Ambiguity in Earth's ""Tilt""","It’s well-known that the axial tilt of the Earth (with respect to the ecliptic) is about 23.4 degrees. However, two angles is needed to specify the orientation of any rigid body, so it’s unclear to me exactly how Earth is oriented with respect to its orbital plane.  To be more precise, consider the plane that satisfies these two conditions: 1. Perpendicular to the ecliptic plane 2. Contains the line connecting the Sun and the Earth when Earth is at perihelion (Jan. 2).  (Basically, this plane cuts through the orbit of the Earth such that for half the year Earth is one side and for the other half Earth is on the other side.)  Questions: 1. When the Earth is at perihelion, what is the angle between its rotational axis and the plane described above? I would guess this angle is very small from the images of Earth’s orbit. Is there a technical term for this angle? 2. Does the direction of the axis remain approximately the same throughout its entire orbit?  Please ignore precession for this question. "
3188,"During an eclipse, does the size of the moon and sun match perfectly?","During a lunar or solar eclipse, from our perspective when we look towards the moon and the sun is behind the moon, does it fit exactly?     Has anyone calculated the sizes of each in a relative context?  Obviously the sun is thousands of times larger, but I am talking about the size of the sun/moon when looking from our perspective.  I hope my question makes sense. "
3189,Can the Gaia telescope detect small temporarily captured asteroids near its Lagrange orbit?,"The Gaia space telescope is in a Lissajous orbit around the Sun-Earth Lagrange point 2. The orbit period is about 180 days and the size of the orbit is 263,000 x 707,000 x 370,000 km. It has been theoretically concluded that there should be a population of temporarily captured orbiters (TCO's) around that Lagrange point. All but a handful of them should be less than a meter in diameter and too small to be observed from Earth. Only one TCO, 2006 RH120, has ever been observed, a 5 meter diameter one.  Since Gaia will be in a somewhat similar orbit as the TCO's and will scan the entire sky several times over the coming years, and an IR telescope is sensitive to asteroids, I wonder if it will be able to detect such TCO's. And if so, what could we find out about them? Gaia will not track any asteroids nearby, if it catches the same TCO more than once it would be by chance, I suppose. Could Gaia learn about their sizes, orbits, surface compositions? "
3190,Is it conceivable that the presence of chlorophyll (or similar) could be distinguishable from other chemicals on an exoplanet?,"If an Earth-like exoplanet had a sufficiently extensive plant biosphere (i.e large forests, aquatic algal mats etc), is it at all conceivable that scientists could spectroscopically detect the presence of biochemicals, such as chlorophyll, anthocyanins etc?  If possible, how would the spectra of these biochemicals be distinguished from other chemicals? "
3191,How are microlensing events used to constrain the size of innermost stable circular orbits around spinning black holes?,"The third paragraph of the introduction to the ArXiv preprint Constraining Quasar Relativistic Reflection Regions and Spins with Microlensing says:     Quasar microlensing has significantly improved our understanding of the accretion disks (e.g., [five refs]) and non-thermal emission regions (e.g., [seven refs]) of quasars, and the demographics of microlenses in the lens galaxy (e.g., [three refs]) . Since the magnification diverges on the caustics produced by the lensing stars, quasar microlensing can constrain arbitrarily small emission regions if they can be isolated from other emission, in position, velocity, or energy. In particular, microlensing can be used to constrain the spin of black holes by measuring the ISCO size. (emphasis added)   ISCO was previously identified as innermost stable circular orbit.  From what I understand from Wikipedia's Gravitational microlensing; How it works, a microlensing observation records a short term brightening of an object due to focusing by an intervening gravitational body, without useful spatial resolution.   See also the Planetary Society's explanation Microlensing; Beyond our Cosmic Neighborhood  Question: How are microlensing events used to constrain the size of innermost stable circular orbits around spinning black holes? What instruments are used and what kind of analysis is done to obtain a ISCO constraint?         Example light curve of Gravitational Microlensing event - OGLE-2005-BLG-006 Source  "
3192,Is the expansion of the universe greater than the speed of light?,"If the rate of expansion of the universe is increasing , won't it eventually become greater than c? Also, after inflation, did the rate of expansion slow down and then start to accelerate again? "
3193,Can a natural satellite exist in a geostationary orbit?,"While browsing through Physics SE, I noticed a question about satellites in geostationary orbit (unrelated to the one I'm asking here), and for a moment I interpreted it as referring to natural satellites (e.g. a moon). So I wondered: Could a natural satellite exist in geostationary orbit?  Then I stopped and thought. For large gas giants, such as Jupiter, having moons too close to the planet can be fatal (for the moon). If it ventures inside the planet's Roche limit, it's toast. But there is good news: the Roche limit depends on both the masses and densities of the primary body and the satellite. So perhaps this reason is non-applicable, as a high-mass natural satellite might be able to survive. So the question changes:  Could a sufficiently high-mass, high-density natural satellite occupy geostationary orbit over its primary body? "

3195,"Why does Kepler's ""Big Picture"" of comet 67P look so strange? And what is the significance?","The observation of comet 67P by the Kepler space telescope has been reported in various science news outlets recently. For example, the image below appeared in the recent NASA news article NASA's Kepler Gets the 'Big Picture' of Comet 67P and the same or similar images can be seen elsewhere. The article says:     From Sept. 7 through Sept. 20, the Kepler spacecraft, operating in its K2 mission, fixed its gaze on comet 67P. From the distant vantage point of Kepler, the spacecraft could observe the comet's core and tail. The long-range global view of Kepler complements the close-in view of the Rosetta spacecraft, providing context for the high-resolution investigation Rosetta performed as it descended closer and closer to the comet.      During the two-week period of study, Kepler took a picture of the comet every 30 minutes. The animation shows a period of 29.5 hours of observation from Sept. 17 through Sept. 18. The comet is seen passing through Kepler's field of view from top right to bottom left, as outlined by the diagonal strip. The white dots represent stars and other regions in space studied during K2's tenth observing campaign.   I don't really understand this image. It is a GIF assembled from several exposures, but in each frame, individual stars appear as tight clusters of dots for some reason, and the comet moves within a bright, narrow band that crosses the entire image in all frames. Why does this looks so strange?  Also, what is the importance of Kepler deviating from it's observations to concentrate on 67P during this period? What is the scientific importance of this series of observations?    above: Image credit: The Open University/C. Snodgrass and SETI Institute/E. Ryan From here. "
3196,Could a space radio telescope fill multiple purposes?,"Dream for a while and imagine that there will be a flagship+ mission within a decade to put a large radio telescope in space:   What kind of different tasks could the same radio equipment feasibly be used for? How do the requirements for frequency sensitivity, electric power supply, dish size, and other radio technology (such as applicability of phased array?) and what else vary most importantly between such purposes?   For example, could one and the same big space radio telescope in the Asteroid Belt be used for any, some or all of the below, what would the synergies and contradictions be:  a) Radio astronomy on its own.  b) Interferometry together with a telescope on Earth to create an interplanetary baseline for huge resolution, like the spektr-R does cis-lunar today, AFAIK.  c) Radar characterization of the orbit, shape, size et cetera of any large enough asteroid in its current section of the asteroid belt.  d) Ground penetrating radar to characterize the interior composition of near flyby asteroids.  e) Communication with Earth so powerful that it need not engage the Deep Space Network (DSN), but can work with smaller Earth based radio antenna.  f) Extending the DSN by working as a relay between Earth and outer space probes, or between Earth and the backside of Mars or when Mars is in apposition behind the Sun from Earth. "
3197,Star System Formation questions,"I'm making a game in which I'd like to randomly generate star systems. Which is cool.  The trouble I'm having is working out exactly what limits I need to place on the generation. So far, the wikipedia hasn't been all that helpful. So some questions:   Rocky planets form within the frostline of a protostar. What's the radius of this line? What I'm sort of asking is that given a particular mass and density, what radius from that star is the line. If the jovian planets form outside of this line; why have so many been found within this line in other star systems from our own? Is this only selection bias or is it more likely that our models are incorrect at this point? How does the creation of the gas giants differ from the creation of the ice giants? Is it simply like a second ""frost line"" where there wasn't enough gaseous material to form a large jovian planet but plenty of ices to form ice giants? If so, how is the creation of the ice giants different to Dwarf planets?  "
3198,Flux density to flux,"The definition of flux and flux density is fairly straightforward. However, I'm musing over the practical usage of it.   For one thing, if you observe a source through a filter, how would one go from the total observed energy/number of photons to the flux per unit wavelength? It's not a matter of simply dividing by the width of the filter -- a filter can have any exotic form of course.  So, how is this derived? Related, given a [tex] in some filter, what would be the way to go to total flux within that filter? "
3199,"Is there a general term for epicycles, deferents, and eccentrics in Ptolemaic astronomy?","According to Ptolemy's (c. 150 CE) account of the motions of planets, planets moved in circular paths (""epicycles"") around center points that in turn moved around the center of the earth along a path called a ""deferent"", or around point near the center of the earth, in a path called an ""eccentric"".  (I think I have this right.)  Is there a general term for these three kinds of paths?  ""Orbit"" doesn't seem correct, since none of the three are orbits in the modern sense.  I'd also be interested in knowing of a general term of the centers of these circles.  EDIT: I originally posted this on History.SE, because I think of it as a question for historians of science, and the History of Science SE site is in Area 51.  Someone at History.SE suggested it would be better to ask this question on English.SE.  I did, but I left the original question up at History.SE.  The question got downvoted at English.SE, and was migrated here.  There is now an answer at History.SE that I've accepted. Perhaps this question should be deleted from Astronomy.SE?

I want to be an astronomer and I know that I have to get a B.Sc, then M.Sc, and then Ph.D in astronomy. I have also started to learn the python programming language.

3201,Clarification on Greenwich Sidereal Time (GST),"I know that LST = HA + RA. And GST is LST + longitude(L). If a star culminates, it's HA=0. Therefore, GST = RA + L.

As the notion of ""old"" only makes sense in an observable and ellapsing timeline, the most obvious answer to me would be ""Time is the oldest thing"". There is no such thing as a measurement of ""old"" until there is actually mass to allow time, so which predates which? I'm pretty sure the answer will tightly be linked to Planck's constant, but how?  What am I doing wrong? How could I find relief in an answer that wouldn't be just philosophical, but also logical? :) "
3205,Cosmology : Formula for the bias of galaxies,"first I have posted originally on the physics stackexchange but I have not had answers about my question, so I try my luck on this specific forum (if forums leaders want to delete the original post on physics exchange, they can do it without problems, I don't want to make duplicates).  From this article : [website]1) the global number density of galaxies  2) the local number density of galaxies  3) the contrast of Dark matter density  The relation that I would like to find (the relation given by my teacher) is very simple :  [tex]  where [tex] is the local number density of galaxies in Universe, [tex] is the global number density, [tex] is the bias (cosmological bias of galaxies) and [tex] the contrast in dark matter density. When I say ""local"", I mean in the volume of scale that I consider (in a cluster of galaxies for example, doesn't it ?)  for the moment, I can't find this equation.  Into the article above, they define the bias by doing the relation [tex] (equation reference on the article) :  [tex]  with [tex] the bias.  As you can see, in this article, authors are reasoning with the contrast of density number of galaxies ([tex] and the contrast of matter density of Dark matter ([tex]).  I tried to modify this equation [tex] to get [tex] but I am stuck by the following difference : on one side, one takes number densities and on the other one, they take contrasts of density (with contrast density number and Dark matter contrast).  Multiplying the both by the volume [tex] is not enough since there is the value ""-1"" in the definition of contrast : I don't know if I have to write :  [tex]  or   [tex]  ???  I think that I have to use the following relations : [tex] and [tex] in the relation of my teacher but I am not sure.  Anyone could help me to find the equation (1) from the equation (2) of article cited ?  EDIT 1:  If I take the relation eq[tex], I can write :  [tex]  As you can see, [tex] is not equal to the equation [tex] that I would like to get (since a second term [tex])  With the notations of the equation[tex], in order to be coherent, I think that I have to assimilate [tex] to [tex] (local density) and [tex] to [tex] (global or mean density).  How can I circumvent this issue about the presence of this second term into eq[tex] compared to eq[tex] ?  I am near from the equality between both, this is frustrating . Maybe it is a problem of convention about the factor [tex] called ""bias"" ?  Any help is welcome, Regards  Regards "

3209,Why does the adiabatic exponent decrease at the ionization zones?,"The context is the ionization zones in stellar atmospheres or interiors, the Sun, for instance.  The adiabatic exponent is the heat capacity ratio:  [tex]  And, for an ideal gas, it can be shown that  [tex] where [tex] is the degrees of freedom. Resulting in [tex].   In most of the extent of the solar interior, [tex] but it presents dips when ionization is present, like the H, HeI and HeII ionization zones. My question is why does this happen?  I thought it could be because when ionization, the heat is used to ionize atoms instead of increasing the temperature and, therefore, the heat capacity would be larger in those regions. But, because the [tex] is the ratio between the heat capacities, the argument does not work.  Any suggestion? "
3210,Is there a consensus as to where terrrestrial planet atmospheres in our solar system came from?,"I tried to research this and I'm not sure if there is a consensus where the [tex], [tex], etc. comes from on terrestrial planets like Venus, Earth and Mars. Possible sources would be accretion from the protoplanetary disk, outgassing (which I would think would require plate tectonics/ molten core) or reactions at the surface caused by stellar radiation. Also, reactions in the atmosphere can alter the composition. Would it be a combination of all of the above and, if so, do we know if one of the processes dominated over the others? Does anybody have a good link that discusses this? "
3211,World line coordinate finiteness,"If you trace two particles' world line backwards in time, according to current theory, both objects should converge at big bang.  Would both objects arrive there simultaneously?  Another way of asking the question:  Is there any evidence that supports the idea that new matter is ""introduced"" into the universe as a continuous stream, as opposed to everything coming from a singularity both in time and space?  The analogy would be from the inside of a black hole. For each particle in that singularity, they would all have a world line that starts at the same spacial coordinate, but the particles would not be ""introduced"" into the black hole simultaneously. You can argue that time stops having meaning in a black hole, but that's only true for an ""outer observer"" in my reasoning. "

3213,From whence is the Event Horizon Telescope black hole data available for amateur reconstruction?,"Ralf Vandebergh's tweet shows his own reconstruction of an image of the accretion disk around a black hole, generated presumably from Event Horizon Telescope data.  I'm assuming that the data came from a publicly available source, but I don't know for sure. That would make sense, they used two completely independent groups to reconstruct the images to cross-check each other before they were published, because with so few of the telescopes in the array recording data at any one time, the reconstruction took a bit of artistic license or ""filling in"".   Since the raw data is huge, boxes and boxes of hard drives with high speed digital recording of GHz rate ADC conversions, I don't think there's an ftp site for the actual raw data. And since calibrations and baselining is pretty complicated, it would be hard to reconstruct.  So I'm wondering what kind of data is available that would allow someone to reconstruct their own EHT image?  FYI Ralf Vandebergh's astrophotography can be found in links within Why exactly do “CMOS astrophotographers” prefer CMOS sensors?

3215,Why different specifications for telescopes and binoculars?,"Sorry for the noob question but I don't seem to be able to find the answer on the internet.  I've been looking through some telescopes and binoculars and noticed that shops typically give different specifications for the two groups. For example, for telescopes I'll often see focal length, aperture ratio, or limit value, but I haven't seen any of those for binoculars; for binoculars, on the other hand, they'll mention exit pupil, field of view, or glass material, none of which I've seen given for a telescope.

3218,Why does the neutral hydrogen velocity have this characteristic behavior in the galactic plane?,"The recently released map of galactic neutral hydrogen density and velocity is really beautiful. The work has been relased by the HI4PI collaboration (HI = neutral hydrogen, [tex] = complete spherical coverage).  My question is fairly simple. Looking at the image near the galactic plane, why do I see near the center a green bump on the left and a blue bump on the right, then near the edges of the image a much stronger blue bump on the left and a green bump on the right. In other words, there is a major and a minor peak in the positive radial velocity gas, and a major and a minor peak in the negative radial velocity gas.   Does this have some simple geometrical explanation?      above x2: neutral hydrogen density/velocity map from here with inset indicating color scale expanded.    above: for those who can not distinguish the green and blue in the image, this plots the average green (solid) and blue (dashed) intensity within the central equatorial band.  There is a nice article at phys.org with a video, which can also be seen in YouTube. It shows the intensity of HI as a cut in radial velocity is slowly scanned through the data set.

3219,Darkness in Outer Space,"I am trying to imagine how dark outer space is. Looking at images of cosmonauts in space proved not very useful, as the exposure makes space look completely dark.  Thinking about it, I would imagine an object would be quite well illuminated, being bombarded by provided it's not in the shadow of a planet or some other celestial body. Is that correct? How about light scattering? Is cosmic dust abundant enough for the purpose?  EDIT: @zephyr made me realize that the quantity of light is a function of position, so let's say the question is with regards to the Milky Way. Still, I would appreciate some comments on what's the situation outside the Milky Way too. "

3221,"Question about Telescopes , observations and explanations of the observations","Though I am active on Physics, I am new to Astronomy. I am an amateur astronomer, actually even worse than amateur. I have just started it. I have a 60 mm objective 700mm focal length refractor which I mainly use with a 20 mm eyepiece.  I have a couple of questions regarding the telescope, observations and explanations behind observations. Since they are all interlinked I decided to ask them together.  1) So, firstly the basics. Regarding the resolution power of a telescope, we know from the Rayleigh criterion that diffraction does happen at the objective. But Diffraction happens when light passes through a narrow slit or bends around a corner (whose dimensions are of the order of the wavelength of light). But there is no slit and probably no bending of light. How come then do we assume a diffraction pattern to have formed when considering the derivation of the resolution of a telescope?  2) How are exit pupil and entry pupil different from the diameter of the eyepiece and objective?  3) Why on increasing the magnification does the brightness of the object reduce (the physics behind it)? I mean that if I use 4mm eyepiece then, first of all, it becomes very difficult to find the object and secondly its brightness gets reduced when compared to the brightness that I had got using a 20mm eyepiece?  4) Secondly why do the Barlow lenses reduce the brightness a lot. And why on using  Barlow lenses the field of view get smaller and the object passes twice as quickly as without the Barlow?  5) Now the biggest question. How is it possible that every time I point my telescope towards a visible planet or a star (I know it's a star because of the sky map), I see almost the same size, when stars are visible only as small dots. The stars appear to be bluish and the planets which I have seen (Mars and Jupiter) appear reddish. That's ok but a star can not be visible as a sphere. Stars appear as dots, don't they?  6)How can I make the telescope give the best results i.e which eyepiece should I use and whether I should use Barlow lenses or not? "
3222,What is the illuminance of Tau Ceti?,"As part of my physics project, I investigated the relationship between a light bulb's illuminance and the distance from the measuring device to it.  Illuminance was measured in flux, and distance in metres.  I derived an inverse relationship. First of all, can I check if this is the relationship I was supposed to get? (I understand that there is an inverse square relationship between luminosity and distance, but since illuminance is measured in lumens/sq metre, then I think an inverse relationship is correct...)  Next, using this relationship, I need to extend my project so that I can find distances to stars using this relationship.  As long as 2 stars have a similar mass/size/density, then I can use this relationship to find the distance to the 2nd star as long as the illuminance of the stars are known, and the distance to the 1st star is known.  So I tried to do this with an example - the Sun and Tau Ceti, as they are reasonably similar.  I have values for the Sun's distance/illuminance - [tex]km, [tex]lux. I now am trying to calculate the distance to Tau Ceti using this method.... But nowhere can I find a value for its illuminance.  Please can someone help me with this? Is there a way to convert from apparent magnitude or luminosity to illuminance?  Thank you  EDIT: The method I want to use from the inverse relationship is:  [tex]  where [tex] and [tex] are the known distance and illuminance of the 1st star, whilst [tex] and [tex] is that of the second, and [tex] is unknown.

3227,Why most planets don't spin retrograde?,"Edit: just found duplicate  Since orbital velocity is greater on small orbits, and smaller on large orbits, why don't planets spin retrograde around their own axis?   One portion of planet's mass is closer to its star, and should move prograde relative to center of mass.   Part of the planet's mass far from the star orbits higher and should move retrograde relative to center of mass,   which should create a resulting retrograde spin, with rotation speed depending on planet's diameter.  What's wrong with this? ( since fact is : most planets spin prograde )      In this not to scale second illustration, planet is replaced by two masses linked by a beam. Kepler's law of equal surfaces swept per unit of time is used to display the retrograde rotational force that should be applied relative to center of mass, which orbits black path.  EDIT : Ok I think I found where my mistake is(?) Differential gravitational pull (yellow arrows) counteracts retrograde rotational force (green arrow) Which results in no rotational force at all. Anyway I still don't get how conservation of momentum of everything orbiting the sun, also applies to spin direction of orbiting objects.   "
3228,Examples of astrophysical objects NOT in virial equilibrium?,"Astronomers always talk about astrophysical objects being in virial equilibrium (e.g., a stellar system, or a disk of gas within a galaxy, etc.). But I never hear about thermodynamical equilibrium.   What are some examples of objects that are not in virial equilibrium?  One example question: suppose that what you thought was a disk of rotating gas within a galaxy (as revealed by spectroscopy) is actually a bipolar outflow of gas. Would the bipolar outflow of gas be in virial equilibrium?   Is a radio jet (length of hundreds of kpc) from a supermassive black hole in virial equilibrium?  "

Now I have a question regarding all of the answers that I always either give or read: The question linked is the last question and answer that I saw before posing this question here, and is in no way the same question, as this question asks how the concept of a centerless universe can work, whereas the question below asks about how a universe can be perceived to be centerless even when it might not be.  Is the Universe centerless? Or does it simply appear to be because of our perspective?    [tex] This is about to be a bad example, but please bear with me.    If you were a bird floating in the ocean, among a myriad of other birds, and you let time pass such that every bird floated away from the other birds in some random fashion. Would you, at some later time when everybirdy was roughly separated from one another, say that based upon your observations of the present conditions, and some evidence that at one point all of the birds were together, that the ocean is centerless? Or could you assume that because of your position in the flock, that from your perspective you can't tell where the center is, nor do you think that from a different birds position would you be able to tell? Creating the illusion of a centerless ocean.  Obviously this requires you not be at or close to the very edge of the flock.  Edit: Also see examples in KenG's posed answer and comments. "
3230,Centre (projected) of a galaxy cluster,"A galaxy cluster consists of somewhere around a few tens to several hundred galaxies.   To measure the position of a galaxy cluster, i.e. it's RA and DEC, do astronomers always assume it to be its Brightest Cluster Galaxy BCG's position?  It has been shown by Johnston et al. 2007 that BCGs are not always found in the centre of a cluster/halo. If so, does the assumption of taking the position of a BCG to be the position of the galaxy cluster still hold true? "
3231,Can the centripetal force be inverted?,"Using the centripetal force to create artificial gravity has been proposed for space exploration. From our perspective, the force is an outward force, pushing objects away. Could it be inverted to attract them instead?   Could we, instead of having a spacecraft, or a ""dish,"" rotate to create the force that would push the travelers to the inside of the hull - could we instead have a cluster of dishes rotating in such a manner that the travelers are pressed to the outside of a sphere?   Or, could we construct an artificial mini-planet with a gravity exceeding by far the gravity of a natural celestial body with the same mass? "
3232,What does it mean for a planet to be just 300 kms across?,"The recently discovered Planet Goblin is just 300 kms across. While I perfectly understand what it literally means, I'm having trouble wrapping this in my head. Does it mean I can imagine the planet as (approximately) a sphere for 300 kms diameter? That gives a radius of 150 kms, and thus a circumference of 942 kms.   A circumference of 942 kms means that the longest distance between any two points on the surface of the planet is just 471 kms -- That's just over 1.5 times the distance between London to Paris or 100 kms more than the distance between New York and Washington DC or about half the distance between St. Petersburg and Moscow.

Everybody understands the narrow band of the signal, and the frequency of the hydrogen line. This incredible signal strength was logged, but only that, the spectacular strength.

3237,Is diffuse energy distribution considered in the galaxy rotation curve explanations?,"Problem number 23 in chapter 1 of Purcell's ""Electricity and Magnetism"" Second edition page 37 shows that 90% of the energy stored in the electrostatic field of a spherical charge distribution of radius R is contained in a spherical region of 10R.   The energy by this description is diffuse and only partially resides within what we would call the physical bounds of the particle. Gravity has the same form as the electromagnetic force and I would expect would have this same character of distribution of energy (i.e. 90% of the energy of the gravitational mass contained within a radius of 1R is stored within a sphere of 10R).  Is this true of gravitational energy and has this little detail been considered in the galaxy rotation curve explanations? I would think that something this elementary would be well accounted for in galaxy rotation descriptions. Much of the electromagnetic and gravitational energy seems diffused into the area surrounding mass and I think that galaxy rotation curves require more diffuse gravitational energy distribution don't they?

3245,"What ever happened to the ""Small Comet Theory"" of water influx on present-day Earth?","This comment (below the question Is there any new water formed on, or brought to, Earth?) links to the 2002 Article in the New Scientist Was all the Earth’s water brought here by comets? which states:     Evidence that there is a constant rain of small comets, each a loose snowball held together by a carbon shell, first came in the 1980s from satellites that looked down on Earth and observed “atmospheric holes”- dark spots 50 to 100 kilometres across- that were appearing in the dayglow of the atmosphere. The dayglow is ultraviolet light emitted when sunlight interacts with the oxygen in the upper atmosphere. Water is the only common substance that could create such holes, and each could be made by a small comet containing between 20 and 40 tonnes of water that broke up into a cloud of vapour as it hit the atmosphere. The case for a cometary origin for the atmospheric holes grew in the 1990s when the trail of a cosmic snowball was picked up as it vaporised over the Atlantic by the visible imaging cameras on polar satellites.      From the number of atmospheric holes, it’s possible to calculate that the atmosphere is being hit by a 20 to 40-tonne snowball comet every 3 seconds. According to Frank, this is enough to add an inch of water to the Earth’s surface every 20,000 years. Over the 4.5-billion-year lifetime of the Earth they could have provided all the water in the oceans. (emphasis added)   The article also links to this University of Iowa page smallcomets.physics.uiowa.edu/.  Is this still believed to be happening? Have there been additional observations? Is the earth receiving water in the form of 20 to 40 ton comets ariving every three seconds?  Question: What ever happened to the ""Small Comet Theory"" of water influx on present-day Earth? Has it been discounted, modified, verified? "
3246,"How could a 20 inch space telescope ""be able to make out Earth-size planets"" orbiting alpha Centari?","The NY Times article Telescope to Seek Earthlike Planet in Alpha Centauri System describes a proposed effort to put a telescope into orbit fairly quickly with a narrowly defined purpose - to look for planets in the alpha Centari system, which is about 4.37 lightyears away from Earth.  The funding, design, assembly and space deployment fairly quickly is made possible in part by the narrowly defined purpose and the compelling public interest in this particular question.   I got out my box of envelope-backs and did the following. Since there is no air, there's no need for adaptive optics so  the standard diffraction limit applies. For an Airy disk:  [tex]  The article describes the telescope as washing machine-sized, with an aperture of 20 inches, or about 50 cm.  If I choose a visible wavelength of 500nm, I get a resolution of about 1.22 microradians ([tex]R). 4.37 lightyears is about 4.13E+13 km or 2.76E+05 AU.   That makes the airy disk about 0.34 AU at alpha Centari. The actual point spread function of a telescope depends not only on the theoretical diffraction of the aperture, but diffraction from secondaries and supports within the aperture, on aberrations due to imperfectly shaped optical surfaces and scatter and haze due to nano-roughness of mirror surfaces. (see below)  Could a 20 inch telescope and associated experiment package be put together quickly that could actually resolve (or ""make out"" as the article says) an Earth-like planet in the alpha Centari system from space? If so, what is it exactly that it could do that can't be done from any existing telescope in orbit or on Earth?    above: ""A rendering of the compact exoplanet imaging telescope Project Blue plans to launch into orbit and aim at Alpha Centauri. Credit Project Blue"" from here.  It jumps out that the secondary is mounted off-axis, which can have mechanical and optical advantages (e.g. diffraction) but would probably limit the image quality to a narrow field of view, which might be OK for a single-target telescope if there are suitable calibration targets nearby.    A nice discussion of the point spread function of the Hubble space telescope can be found here: 20 years of Hubble Space Telescope optical modeling using Tiny Tim (Krist et al 2011, Proc. of SPIE Vol. 8127 81270J-1), and the reduction of scatter and haze from mirror nano-roughness by using refractive optics (lenses) is addressed by the DRAGONFLY instrument (see also this question).

3255,Are there upper or lower mass limits for black holes?,"Natarajan &amp; Treister (2008) describes a practical upper limit for black hole masses at [tex]. This is all due to the black hole's interactions with nearby matter.  However, is there a theoretical upper mass limit for black holes in general relativity? More specifically, do any solutions make note of this? Would this depend on whether the black hole described is eternal or time-variant, static or spinning, charged or uncharged, etc.?  Similarly, do any metrics make note of lower mass limits? Would it be possible for a black hole with the mass of an electron to exist (at any point in time, putting aside Hawking radiation)? "
3256,How to tell a pulsar is rotation-powered or accretion-powered?,"We need to calculate P/Pdot?  A pulsar may switch between theses two states.  For a rotation powered pulsar, it can pulse and, the pulsed Lx can be much larger than the luminosity given by its rotation?    If Lx is very small, smaller than the luminosity given by its rotation, how to tell it is rotation-powered or accretion-powered? There are not necessarily X-ray pulsations  You can see I am asking a very tricky scenario. "
3257,Does binarity play a role in spectral fitting?,"Most of the spectroscopic surveys like SDSS classify stars into one pure spectral type.  However, a large fraction of stars are in binaries.  Can we know whether a spectral fitting is good enough? Is there something like [tex]?  In other words, is it possible we can estimate the probability that a star is in a binary based on one spectrum? "
3258,Eventual outcome of tidal acceleration and deceleration,"So, I know the Moon experiences tidal acceleration from the Earth. And, from what I've read, if not for the fact that the sun would boil away the oceans and engulf both of them first, about 50 billion years from now the Moon would be geosynchronous.  I was curious whether tidal acceleration could ever cause a satellite to escape, and short answer seems to be, yes, it's possible. Is that accurate? And if so, which factors add to it?   A faster rotating planet also results in tides farther ahead, and has more energy to lose before being totally locked. Very closely related, a farther satellite orbits more slowly, resulting in tides farther ahead, and requires less energy to escape. This one seems obvious: the faster the planet is still rotating while the satellite is farther away, the more likely it escapes. A more fluid planet would experience stronger tides, which would again slow it down faster, but definitely accelerate the satellite faster. A more viscous fluid than water would experience weaker tides, but I think they'd be farther ahead. I think more fluid is definitely more effective, but it seems less obvious than the first point. A larger planet would have its orbit slowed less by tidal acceleration, but have a stronger pull to escape. A larger satellite would cause stronger tides and more tidal force, but would require more force to accelerate, and would slow the planet down more quickly. I really can't tell which has the stronger effect...   So that's question 1:  Is it really possible for tidal acceleration to throw a satellite into space before the planet is tidally locked, and if so, does either objects' size impact it, or just fluidity and relative periods?  Then, I wondered about tidal deceleration, and crashing into the planet. It seems obvious that any satellite orbiting retrograde would never stop decelerating, so all would eventually get torn apart and crash onto their planet. For non-retrogade satellites, an article I read implied that all of them will have the same fate... Which implies that the planet's rotation will always speed up more slowly than the satellite's falling orbit. Is that true? If not, then it seems there must be cases where the planet's rotation catches up, and they again end up tidally locked.  So that's question 2: Will all non-retrogade tidally decelerating satellites eventually crash into their planet, or is it possible for the planet to catch up given the right starting conditions?  Edit: Haven't really found any more information on this. Is there someone familiar with relevant equations, who knows the answer? "

3262,Which measurements have shown that 2014 MU69 is red? (New Horizons' next target),"The recent NASA feature article New Horizons: Possible Clouds on Pluto, Next Target is Reddish     MU69 is actually the smallest KBO to have its color measured – and scientists have used that data to confirm the object is part of the so-called cold classical region of the Kuiper Belt, which is believed to contain some of the oldest, most prehistoric material in the solar system.      “The reddish color tells us the type of Kuiper Belt object 2014 MU69 is,” said Amanda Zangari, a New Horizons post-doctoral researcher from Southwest Research Institute. “The data confirms that on New Year’s Day 2019, New Horizons will be looking at one of the ancient building blocks of the planets.”   Gizmodo elaborates on the significance of the red color:     Speaking today at the the American Astronomical Society Division for Planetary Sciences (DPS), mission scientists talked about the Pluto flyby, but they also looked ahead to the Kuiper Belt encounter. Recent observations made by the Hubble Space Telescope suggests MU69 is red—if not redder—than Pluto. MU69 is now the smallest KBO to have its color measured, and it’s our first sense of what this mysterious object actually looks like.      The reddish color of MU69, like the iconic red splotches on Pluto and its moon Charon, suggest the presence of tholin, a class of molecules that’s formed through the ultraviolet irradiation of simple organic compounds such as methane and ethane. Tholin doesn’t form naturally on Earth, but it’s abundant on the surface of icy bodies in the outer solar system. Using Hubble, scientists have confirmed that MU69 is part of the “cold classical” region of the Kuiper belt, which contains some of the oldest objects in the Solar System.   How was the ""redness"" of 2014 MU69 detected? The second link mentions that it is Hubble data - is it just photometric (images through different filters) or is there also spectroscopy?  I'm curious, just how red is it? What exactly are the numerical data that are being interpreted as ""redness""? Is this exclusively the assumed visual appearance, or is there excess infrared as well?   Also, I wasn't sure if 2014 MU69 is considered a comet or an asteroid. So far everything I've read just calls it a Kuiper Belt Object (KBO). So I've used both tags.    above: graphic from NASA blogs. It looks like they are all red! (joke). "

3264,Can we measure comets in a similar way to exoplanets?,"A 2km comet at 40AU's can dim a sun sized star at 100 light years by 3%, and a 10km comet can cause an eclipse (is that right?) So would 2,3,10 km objects be easy to measure via star dimming if we had enough telescopic data from space?   Can we measure lines of stars that are eclipsed/dimmed in sequence by transiting comets?   Given 1000 frames of a small patch of space, where all the images are recorded into a 3D image stack (a 3D array, a voxel) X,Y and Time as dimensions, then an Intel processor can compare 20 million voxels per second of that collection of images to search for vector information of aligned patterns of star dimming, i.e. searching for vectors of comets.  If that process is repeated for many patches of space, perhaps we can detect many comets, and I don't know the real maths involved, if a satellite of that design would realistically only find 1 comet, or 5000?  It's for a theoretical comet apprehension system which uses 2/3 identical satellites  each comprised 100Tb of SSD and a 20Mflops processors to search for vector information in the images.  Some kind of fairy idea going around in my head, because of Oumuamua and because I work on voxels and I know that image collections from space can be stacked into 3D arrays and be searched for vector patterns at 2million voxels per second on a 200W PC, an idea that I am confusedly astrally-projecting as a basis to find comets.  edit- A quantitative answer would be cool, say if the voids between stars on the milky way arm are 8 times the width of the comet, the comet would on average hit 2 stars every 8x8 frames.

It seems to be monitored by radiometers, but I don't understand how that can be used.

3270,How to calculate the current distance between two planets,"I'd like to add a feature to one of my apps that calculates the current distance between the Earth and Mars (or any other planet, for that matter). My google searches have led me to statistics of average distances (as a planets orbit is elliptical, and therefore the distance can vary greatly), as well as articles about Keplers laws of Planetary motion and more. I have also seen some mentions of HORIZONS, but looking over it I did not see anything to fulfill my questions.  I haven't found any readings explicitly describing how to calculate the current distance between two planets. So, how is this done?  Please explain your answer and the steps needed, so that I may understand better. Pseudocode is welcome.  Thanks! "
3271,Will the Earth ever be tidally locked to the Moon?,"From my basic understating,   Momentum is being transfered from the Earth's rotation to the Moon's orbit by tidal friction. The Earth's rotation slows down and the Moon receedes from the Earth as it moves into a higher orbit. This will continue until the Earth's rotational period is equal to the orbital period of the Moon, i.e the Earth is tidally locked to the Moon.  Assuming I have the above correct - and please correct me if I don't - will there, realistically, be enough time for tidal locking to  occur before the sun expands and engulfs the Earth? Or is there another reason the Earth will never be locked towards the Moon? "
3272,"Since gravity is like an indent on a piece of paper (the space/time matrix) to a marble, can the black hole eventually suck in the matrix?","Can a black hole suck in time?

And if you put something that was heavy enough, the trampoline would snap. So could a black hole suck in the matrix?? "

3274,Understanding gravity,"Forgive me if my question has an obvious answer, but I need to know the answer. I always thought that more massive/energetic objects had a stronger force of gravity than less massive ones; that is, the Sun would create a stronger gravitational pull than the Earth does.  Upon looking into Newton's law of universal gravitation, I began to wonder whether I misunderstood this. Does the gravity between the Sun and Earth have an equal force on both? As in, does the Earth pull the Sun with as much force as the Sun does on Earth? If so, would the Sun just resist accelerating to Earth because it is extremely massive? Mass is just an object's resistance toward accelerating from a force, right?   If this is the case, would it apply to GR? Sorry for hypothesizing, I'm honestly trying to get a grasp on it. "

3278,"Just how ""locked"" are resonant-chains of exoplanets thought to be?","update: The BBC News article Citizen science bags five-planet haul announces the system K2-138, also described as a ""resonant chain"" of planets. However, see the actual paper in ArXiv and Ast. J. where the title calls it only a ""near-resonant chain"" instead; The K2-138 System: A Near-Resonant Chain of Five Sub-Neptune Planets Discovered by Citizen Scientists  The Phys.org news item Discovery of new planet reveals distant solar system to rival our own outlines the recent announcement of results using AI to help search Kepler photometric (transit-method) data for exoplanets. Near the end is the paragraph:      Kepler-90i wasn't the only jewel this neural network sifted out. In the Kepler-80 system, they found a sixth planet. This one, the Earth-size Kepler-80g, and four of its neighboring planets form what is called a ""resonant chain,"" where the planets are locked by their mutual gravity in a rhythmic orbital dance. The result is an extremely stable system, similar to the seven planets in the TRAPPIST-1 system, so precisely balanced that the length of Kepler-80g's year could be predicted with mathematics.   My question is about these ""resonant-chains"" of planets. If I understand correctly this would be a group of planets where due to mutual perturbative effects they are in orbits who's periods are in mutual rational number ratios, e.g. 3:2 or 7:9.  Is it known yet how long-lived (time domain) or narrow (frequency) domain these resonances are, or are likely to be? In other words, are they thought to be really ""locked"" into these fixed ratios for say tens or even hundreds of millions of orbits, or are the orbits just really close, but with occasional, irregular ""slippage"" events?  Since the span of data and its precision is limited, I would expect that one can not conclude from the data alone, and it's likely some modeling has been done on resonant-chains of planets to improve the understanding of the phenomenon, so I'm asking to understand what's known and believed, rather than a precise answer about a given system. Since the problem is mostly orbital mechanics it lends itself more easily to simulation than most problems.  As background, Wikipedia addresses ""locked"" orbital resonances:     Under some circumstances, a resonant system can be stable and self-correcting, so that the bodies remain in resonance. Examples are the 1:2:4 resonance of Jupiter's moons Ganymede, Europa and Io, and the 2:3 resonance between Pluto and Neptune. (emphasis added)  "
3279,"Why don't we see ""the milky way"" in both directions?","We're (basically) in the middle of an arm of our galaxy. That is to say, we're sitting in the middle of a dense disc of stars.  It would seem to me that. You should see:  the thick line of the milky way all around you, i.e. on that plane, in all four directions.  (Additionally - sure - in the particular direction of the galaxy center, you would additionally see the huge central bulge.)  However: this does not seem to be the case: when you look at the milky way from the vicinity of our solar system, you basically see it ""in one direction"".  What am I misunderstanding?  How come the sky object ""the milky way"" is well-known as only a lump/strip in one direction, rather than, a lump/strip that goes right around us?  --  Put it this way...  Quite simply does anyone have any photography of the anti-galactic point?  (Near ""Auriga"" right?)  Does it show any ""milky way band"" going through it?  If not why not?

3280,How to cool down a moon?,"I'm doing an Astronomy project and need to terraform a moon. It is about the size of Mars and orbits a gas giant which is at a distance of 1.28 AU of its star. I though about putting a sunshade at the Lagrange point L1 between the planet and the star, but I don't think that would be consistently cooling the moon (by about 30K). For the purpose of this project, it's surface is mostly water, and the atmosphere is mostly water vapor. Any ideas how to tackle this problem? Any way to raise the albedo, or maybe getting a sunshade to work? Be it at a Lagrange point or in orbit around the moon? I still want to do this project by myself, I could just use an idea or two, maybe some initial help with the calculations. Thanks in advance :) "

There's something really amazing about the way that the spectrogram has been folded so nicely on to this image. Is this what it looks like on a 2D detector?

3283,Questions about convolving/deconvolving with a PSF,"A point spread function (PSF) has many different uses. Consider for instance the following quote:     To  extract  the  maximum  information  out  of  an  observation, even the smallest details of the PSF are important. Some examples include: deconvolving the PSF from an observed image to remove the blurring caused by diffraction and reveal fine structure; convolving a model image by the PSF to compare to an observed one;   My question about this is the following: If we know the PSF of a system, and use this to deconvolve the raw image (purpose 1 from the quote above), why would we convolve a model with the PSF to compare it to an image (purpose 2 from the quote)? That is, can't we just compare the original, unconvolved model, with the deconvolved image? In terms of maximizing the information that seems like the way to go. "
3284,"Does gravity bend light, and how much time does it take for light to cross gravity of a Black Hole?","This is very confusing to me, so the question might be same. Please go through it, if required i will add more text.  According to Einstein's theory of general relativity, photons are not technically affected by large gravitational fields; instead space and time become distorted around massive objects and the light simply follows this distorted curvature of space.  My questions are: 1) For example: 1 hour near a black hole, is equivalent to 100 Years on Earth. If the light travels through this distorted space and time around a black hole, how much earth time does it take for light to cross the black hole's gravity?  2) We say the Universe is 14 Billion Years old, and its diameter is 91 Billion Light Years approximatly. My assumption is, these age and diameter of universe is based on the measurement of the light travel (Light is one of the factor in many).  3) So, if first (1) and second (2) points are right, how can we say the Universe is created 14 Billion Years ago (if light takes 100 Earth Years to cross over the black hole's gravity)?

3286,How often do comet occultations of stars happen?,"By travelling to specific places, astronomers can see three thousand star comet transition events every year at m15 for the major (50km+) comets and asteroids averaging about 20 seconds, perhaps that's 25k transitions if they listed 2 seconds occultations by the same 50km comets, perhaps that's not an exhaustive survey, it may be 5/10/20k?  Some easy and fun maths:  There are about 500 >50km comets, and 100k >5km which would transition visibly at 40AU's, so that's 600,000 total eclipses of   There are 1000,000 >1km comets that cause eclipses of average m20 stars, and there are 100 times more m20 stars than the m15 ones, that's 60mn star dimming events at m20.  Conversely, We can perhaps divide that number by 100 (difficult figure to know) for a static view, but you would have to run very fast with your telescope to see 60 million star dimming positions every year, Can we keep the figure at 60mn or is it logical to change that to 0.6?  I must have misjudged it by 1-2 orders of magnitude, multiple times less for velocity or something. Can we surmise if it is 60k or 60million at m15 and m20?   If a comet of 11km at 40AU's travels through the disk of the galaxy, it can hide stars for at least 0.5 seconds. If the stars are N times distanced than the comet's diameter from a perspective, the comet would hide two stars every NxN frames, so for N = 5, a different star would dim every 25 frames. What is the real maths to say what the figure N is at the disk of the galaxy for something like Halley's Comet at m15 and m20?   this page sais: [website]In reality there are probably hundreds of asteroid occultations every night.  However many cannot be observed for practical reasons (e.g. star too dim, event duration too short, etc.). "
3287,How is the Milky Way on a collision course with Andromeda when the universe is expanding?,"At some time in the future it is said our galaxy will collide with Andromeda. Yet at the same time the universe is expanding at a ever-accelerating pace. Using the old raisin-in-the-baking-loaf-of-bread analogy, the raisins grow farther apart and don’t “collide” with each other during the baking process. It seems to be the same way with galaxies and the expanding universe.   How are these two seemingly conflicting postulates reconciled? What am I missing here? "
3288,Why don't we use amateur astronomers' telescopes to create a huge interferometer?,"Some telescopes in space have been proposed to function as an interferometer.  Being placed several hundreds or thousands of kilometers apart they could actual image exoplanets directly. To my knowledge none of these space telescopes have yet been deployed. So I was wondering why we don't connect all the several thousand amateur telescopes on Earth together to create a huge interferometer? That sure would require some efforts (especially software to coordinate it all) but compared to sending telescopes into space it seems outright simple. Are amateur telescopes simply not strong enough, even when linked together? What would be the best we could achieve? "
3289,Does spacetime return to being flat?,"I wrote an experiment in HTML5 and Javascript to try to show what is happening to the curvature of spacetime as a body moves through a region.  As time progresses, I'm using the g=Gm/r2 equation to move the spacetime grid toward the object. When a grid point is within the body, I use g(1-h/R) to modify the bending according to the acceleration at the surface. This assumes uniform density.  The result is that it takes a very large mass and very long time for any sort of noticeable curvature to occur (as you'd expect). By decreasing the Earth's radius by a factor of 3, I was able to see the curvature very well as in the screenshot below.  What occurred to me then is that the the warping of space would remain long after the body of mass had moved on.  Does this warping in space ever return to truly ""flat"" or is the fact that we almost never orbit through the same absolute region of space mean we never experience this existing warping?  If light went through this ""wake"" would it bend according to the spacetime curvature created by the long distant planet? Or have I gone wrong in my model?    This demo uses real values except that the radius is shrunk by 3x to increase its gravitation effect.  earth.radius = 6.371e6 / 3; earth.mass = 5.972e24;   spacetimeGrid.extent = 4.5e7;   You can run the demo here: [website]"

So where does this mass go? A measure of how much matter is there in a object is called mass right? so how does that matter stays in a 1-D space?  We know that matter occupy space so how?

Secondly, is there a place in the world where a sunrise/sunset occurs over a period of a few days? Meaning, that from the time it begins to appear over the horizon until it is fully visible, a period of a few days pass without night intervening (and the same for the opposite with sunset)? "
3295,What phenomena was this video from SOHO actually showing?,"My friend showed me a video of a CME that looked as if it was swirling into a gigantic circular ""spaceship"" or ""UFO"" and he explained it as ""an alien ship potentially refueling"". I did a bit of research and I know assumed the images he was showing me were from SETI SOHO and they were yellow, meaning it was obviously only a single or a couple wavelengths of light shown (possibly UV?).  [website]disclaimer: this clip is overly-liberal in its subtitles...  If yoy habe the original source that would be awesome.  Making a total BLIND guess- I'd say the plasma was swirling into the filament of the CME before it reached a critical mass to be pushed away from the sun? Once departed from the energy of the sun under certain conditions it would no longer show because it wouldn't have enough energy to emit the correct wavelength of light?  Am I even remotely correct? Obviously the space ship explanation has no merit- it's just from some dude. Hoping to get a clarification on the video, I do not believe it is a ""UFO refueling"" heh. Im not a conspiracy nut, and neither is my bud- so we're looking for a science answer :). "
3296,"What is a ""limited array""?","I'm reading about the history and making of ESO's Very Large Telescope and I've found this article that says the scientific community had a choice between three suggestions: a one-piece 16m-telescope, four 8m-telescopes or 16 4m-telescopes. They chose the second solution (four 8m-telescopes), because     there was a clear trend that some form of limited array was the right direction for the VLT.   I don't understand what limited array means. Is it just a name they picked up from radio interferometry, or is it some special method of interferometry being used at the VLT? The article says, that     the study group [for the VLT] concentrated its efforts on the scientific advantages one could draw from the limited array concept and particularly on interferometry.""   Could anyone clear this up for me? "
3297,Is this a real photo or an art work?,"I've never seen this Hubble picture, is it an artist impression? It's fascinating because there are voids apparently cause by supernovae.    From the video 1 Hour of Epic Space Music: COSMOS - Volume 1  The deviant art mentioned in the information below the video is by Natasha Sharma, she has a different style than that. There are also real photos from hubble in the video, I can't tell if it is a genius space artist or a real photo. "
3298,Does time dilation increase within overlapping gravitational fields?,"If a spaceship was to travel to the barycenter of a binary star (the stars having identical size and mass) and come to a stop there, would the people on board this spaceship find that time is moving slower there (relative to the passage of time experienced outside of the gravitational fields of this binary star) due to the two stars overlapping gravitational fields at this point in space?    Does time dilation increase within overlapping gravitational fields? "
3299,Which observatories help NASA find 5 new asteroids per day?,"I just read the following in the NPR website news article NASA's New 'Intruder Alert' System Spots An Incoming Asteroid.     NASA pays for several telescopes around the planet to scan the skies on a nightly basis, looking for these objects. ""The NASA surveys are finding something like at least five asteroids every night,"" says astronomer Paul Chodas of JPL.   Which telescopes are the ""several telescopes around the planet to scan the skies on a nightly basis"" that NASA pays?   Also, is it really roughly five new actual asteroids identified per day (almost 2,000 per year), or is that 5 objects detected, and only some small fraction turn out to actually be unique, new objects?  5 per day sounds like a lot. "
3300,Finding the number of stars n light-years from the sun,"The nearby stars seem homogenously spaced out enough to give a general ""stellar density."" Does there exist some kind of mathematical expression that can determine the number of stars n light-years from the sun? Or— Is there a rough value for this supposed stellar density idea? (Ex: 0.3 stars per cubic light-year.) "
3301,Would a future hole in the Cosmic Microwave Background show us the edge of the universe?,"If my understanding is correct, the Cosmic Microwave Background always come from our event horizon. By event horizon I mean the edge of the observable universe.  If the universe is finite does it mean that after some time (maybe in billions of years?) there will start being a hole in CMB. As our event horizon let us see CMB from regions further and further away, isn't there a time where it will reach the edge of the universe?  If this is the case, based on the known number of atom and mass of the universe, is it possible to calculate when this will happen? "
3302,What are the craters on the moon with peaks in the middle of them?,Was taking some extremely amatuer pictures of the moon from my cheap telescope with my camera phone...    You see the crater Im talking about? Top right.The one with a little nub in the middle- which Im sure is actually massive. How was this formed differently than the other craters? What couldve caused the hill?  
3303,What's the rationale behind the false colours in solar observation photographs?,"Images from SOHO, SDO and other sun observatories are often coloured differently for different wavelengths or temperatures:   [website]How is the convention of which temperature or wavelength gets which colour established?  Is it simply so that scientists can immediately tell what temperature or wavelength a picture shows, or are the colours optimized to show particular features?  And why is there a white ring or circle in the sunshade in some SOHO imagery, and why different sizes compared to the disc in the two photos above? "
3304,What is the Terra phase?,Does the Moon have a night and day like Earth? When sitting on the Moon and viewing the Earth what does it look like when the Earth goes through phases like the Lunar Phase? How does the sun travel through the Moon's sky facing the Earth like this gif?  Part of my question was a duplicate so I deleted it and posted the other link below. How bright is the full Earth during the lunar midnight? 
3305,How can a singularity rotate?,"So I've heard that all black holes that have been observed rotate to some degree. But if it has zero radius, how is it even possible for the black hole itself to be spinning? Or is it just all the junk inside the event horizon that's rotating?  Maybe it spins with infinite angular velocity and a finite angular momentum? Please explain how this works. "
3306,Finding individual band magnitudes: Why and how is the integration of individual flux values for each wavelength used?,"What differentiates the distance modulus equation to find the difference between two apparent magnitudes? For example,  [tex] leads to the following, in the U band: [tex]  and the relationship involving taking the sum of the fraction of the flux that a star outputs at each wavelength rather than the ratio between the fluxes of two stars, here in the UV band for example:   [tex]  *[tex] = the fraction of the star's flux detected at wavelength lambda.  Succinctly, what is the difference between the above two equations?   More specifically, how would this be used in a real-world situation to find the apparent magnitude of an object? My deduction is that apparent magnitude isn't as simple as taking the flux in a certain filter to find the apparent magnitude, and that each individual wavelength must be accounted for. However, with that notion, why can't we just remove the sensitivity function and change the bounds to those wavelengths within the U band?   The other option would be that this is just more accurate than taking the flux within the U band (referring to the above example), because you would take smaller intervals, possibly over 1 [tex] intervals since infinitesimal ones would be impossible. "
3307,What magnification is required to see detail on Mars / other local bodies?,"I have a 125mm Jones Bird newtonian telescope (very shoddy) with 6x lens (2× + 3×) essentially we were able to see a very small O (yeah that's to scale) with varied shades of red.   Is Mars far away from earth right now relative to the average distance or is it just my telescope not powerful enough?  If I wanted to seriously have a chance at picking up significant features on Mars or perhaps pickup the rings of saturn or the red spot of jupiter, whats the minimum setup that I am going to need?     This setup would run me around 3,000 dollars:      Its named...  Celestron CPC 1100 StarBright XLT GPS Schmidt-Cassegrain 2800mm Telescope with Tripo... [website]Would this be overkill? For $3,000 is this one of the better choices for local planetary observation? "
3308,What would happen if a planet would acumulate mass continously?,"If a star accretes enough mass it collapses into a black hole (I am not a physicist or an astronomer so I guess this is the simplified version).  But what would happen if a forming planet continued to accrete mass (*)?  What transformations would it undergo as it mass increases? Would it become a star? Would it still be a planet until it becomes a black hole? Or something else entirely?  If the answer is different depending if the planet is solid or gas, please consider and explain both possibilities.    (*) hypothetically, let's ignore other problems like how would it do that, or if it would be able to maintain orbit or fall into the star, etc. "
3309,"Once a black hole is formed, is there anything other than Hawking radiation which shortens its life?","Hawking radiation is supposed to very slowly evaporate a black hole (terms and conditions apply :] ).  Apart from Hawking radiation, is there any mechanism or effect that can make a black hole cease to exist? Or once they are formed are they expected to exist in this form ""forever""?  PS: I posted the same question to Physics but I think it applies well to both SEs. So I hope it is okay to try here as wwell.  "
3310,Using Tully Fisher to measure Distance Problem,"Can anyone explain by looking at the solution in the pic, how did the cos (i) came about? I guess they are getting this from the major-minor axis info in the question, but I am not sure about the derivation.  Also v=300/sin(i), what is this formula?  Many thanks :)   "
3311,"Hypothetically, if our sun was yellow would we still see ""white"" colours?","Hypothetically,if our sun was yellow would we still be able to see white colour on objects like snow,cotton etc.? Would we have the phenomenon of rainbow? "
3312,"Was the whole Universe close to Big Bang very small, or just very dense?","I am sorry this question is probably silly for professional astronomers, of which I am not one.  I often hear at lectures that immediately after the Big Bang, the universe was small, say, the size of grapefruit or something like that. But because of inflation which stretched space at super-light (but finite), speed, the observable universe now, may not be the whole universe, and the whole universe may be infinite. If it is infinite, then it would seem that it had to be infinite in infancy as well, just very dense. In fact, it seems ""in the limit"", it had to be infinite even at Big Bang.    So, questions:  Was early universe small, or only dense but still infinite?  How about at Big Bang, was it infinite?  When astronomers say early universe was small, do they simply mean ""the part of the universe which corresponds to our observable universe, was small""? "
3313,Are stars beyond the asteroid belt less constant?,"If we graph the variability of a small bright star which is lined up with the asteroid belt, is it less constant than stars that are far away from the asteroid belt? To what degree does variability change relative to distance away from the most dense areas of the solar system?  I added the arrows to illustrate the question.  "
3314,What is the shape and size of a gamma ray burst?,"As I understand it, a gamma ray burst is created when a massive star collapses into a black hole.  The poles of the black hole eject a massive burst of energy which we know as gamma ray bursts.  So my question... Are gamma ray burst more or less cylindrical in shape?  Somewhat like a quasar, but in a spectrum that is invisible to our visible spectrum?  And if so, what would the diameter of it be? "
3315,Planetary gas giants,"I've read that a gas giant, like Jupiter, doesn't have a rocky surface. But planets must start as a rocky conglomerate of flotsam.    Is the interior so hot that all the material is molten and there is not a crust?   Does the atmosphere creates enough pressure to create a supercritical fluid?      What is the situation on Jupiter? "
3316,Could Black holes forge heavier elements that have yet to be discovered?,"Observations   The heaviest elements known in abundance in nature are forged deep within stars. These elements are made possible by the high densities/pressures within the stars. Black holes are known to have a much higher density/pressure than any known star. Black holes are also known to be a phase of stellar evolution - this suggests that the original star's internal process of forging metals would persist within the resultant black hole. Scientists have forged synthetic/ephemeral heavy metals under conditions which could hypothetically be sustained within a black hole.   Hypothesis:  Black holes forge heavier elements that have not been observed on earth. The conditions needed to sustain these elements are unique to the black hole, due to its high density/pressures. These conditions can be glimpsed, but not sustained in any experimental context   Follow up questions:   Has this been hypothesized? Where can I find research on this topic?  "
3317,Terrestrial Exoplanet Skies – I've Built a Visual Sky Chart. Is it Accurate?,"I'm an artist (and science enthusiast) and I've been trying to find a comprehensive resource that would help me clearly identify likely sky colors (as perceived by human vision) for exoplanets that have atmospheres with a similar chemical composition to Earth. It's trickier than I expected. I've cobbled together several resources, and built what I hope is a decently accurate chart of apparent sun color along with sky color.  UPDATE: I have revised this post and added a new, improved sky chart (below). Science references for sky chart: Ref A, Ref B    How accurate is my chart? Is this a fair representation of sky/sun on alien worlds with heavily Nitrogen/Oxygen atmospheres? In what ways could I improve it?  The chart is not meant to account for things like dust, the look of the sky at sunrise/sunset, or other atmospheric effects. This is meant to be a boilerplate for the baseline look of the sky during the day. However if you'd like to comment on how the sky may change during things like sunset, or with effects like volcanism, I'm game!  Also, I'm more interested in relative color, than getting absolute color 100% right. The image was built in a vector program in RGB mode, so assuming your screen is calibrated in the standard way, we are probably seeing almost the same thing.   Here are the key ideas I've gleamed from my reading that I'm using to build this. I consider most of them tentatively held, and am very open to input:   Earth-like atmospheres would tend to be light to dark blue at the zenith, due to the scattering of low-wavelength blue light. If the planet's sun was very hot, the sky would look a deeper blue, while cooler stars would give the sky a lighter blue to almost white look. When the sun gets to 3000k and below, the sky starts to take on an orange/brown tinge. Like on earth, the horizon is the lightest in color and the zenith the deepest. Denser atmospheres would appear brighter (more washed out) and the primary color in the spectrum more ""pure"" (I'm unsure what the term ""pure"" means exactly when it comes to optical perception...would it look whiter?). Likewise, thinner atmospheres would be less bright than earth's and the colors more ""pure."" With increasing pressure the sky color at the zenith becomes increasingly yellow. In my image this means that an earth-like sky at 10x earth pressure would appear blueish/green near the zenith. At lower temperatures I'm assuming the sun would appear tinged by the color listed under ""star temperature."" Otherwise you'll probably only see the star's color when it's near the horizon.  I'm assuming when you get down into K and M class suns, the surroundings on the planet would take on a progressively redder tinge due to the decreasing prevalence of blue wavelength light. I suspect the gradient of color from horizon to zenith will be steeper/gentler in some atmospheres. I've guessed that the gradient would be more apparent on a high G world (on the right).

3318,What causes jets from newly born stars?,"Newly born stars often have bilateral jets of gas ejected from them at high speeds (hundreds of km per seconds), often ending in Herbig-Haro objects. As I understand it those jets would have something to do with the star's magnetic field.    How does this work? How can a magnetic field cause the high-energy ejection of matter? "
3319,How was the galactic plane established?,"As pointed out in this answer the axes of galactic coordinates are defined such that galactic longitude and latitude (0, 0) point toward the galactic center. But then the plane defined by galactic latitude equal to zero would be parallel to the galactic plane only if the Sun were in the galactic plane as well.   Is that the case?   More generally, by what procedure was the galactic plane actually defined, considering a substantial part of it is obscured by dust (at least in the visible) and most of the mass is dark matter and therefore not observed at all (directly at least)?  Question: How was the galactic plane established? Primarily what kinds of observations were used, and how were they analyzed to help decide how this plane should be chosen? "
3320,Would bacteria on incoming meteors burn before impacting?,"I was watching an old Ancient Aliens last night and there was a whole episode dedicated to how the ""Gods"" (aliens) were spreading disease/plagues.    A good portion of the show was dedicated to how aliens may be sending meteors to Earth with bacteria to spread disease.    Part of this was several scientists talking about an experiment with a rock set in orbit (forgive me that I don't have a link to this).  Said rock had many forms of bacteria on it and after a certain amount of time they grabbed the rock and confirmed that some bacteria can survive space conditions.  Then there were other scientists saying that some forms of bacteria/virus may even get worse in zero gravity or space conditions - used salmonella as an example.  But my question is does this even matter?  Wouldn't any bacteria or virus colonies on a meteorite just burn up in our atmosphere?  "
3321,Earth's perihelion vs winter solstice,I found that Earth's perihelion occurs roughly two weeks after winter solstice similar thing happens for summer solstice and aphelion. I understand what those terms mean but I don't understand the reason for the two-week gap. I actually thought they occur on the same day.   What am I not understanding here? Can anyone explain the reason for the two weeks?   My understanding is that the earth's aphelion and perihelion occur on the major axis of earth's elliptical orbit. Why are they not the extremities of analemma which correspond to solstices? Where is my thinking wrong? 
3322,Composition of planets' core,"It is often possible to find a list of the materials that compose the cores and the mantle of plantes (often they are iron and/or nickel).  How can these materials be determined in our Solar system? In other words, for example, how can we know that Jupiter's core certanly contains iron? "
3323,How could we observe Dyson spheres?,"Hypothetically, if Dyson spheres were already present, how could we observe them? My layman understanding of the reason we believe dark matter exists is that our current estimates of the total mass of the universe is very different from the observed stars. But what if a significant proportion of those stars were covered? My obvious hypothesis is that this would explain the missing mass of the universe, and solve both the question of dark matter and the existence of aliens. "
3324,What visible differences do Geminids have to other meteors,"Unlike all other meteor showers, which originate from comets, Geminids originate from asteroid 3200 Phaethon. Seeing a large number of meteors last night, I noticed they seemed to be much more green than other meteors, but is there anything else I should expect to see different to other meteor showers? Brightness, size, length of trail etc? "
3325,Why can't the surfaces of stars be observed?,"If I'm correctly informed, only three stars: Sol, Betelgeuse and Altair have surfaces which have been resolved by telescopes. All other stars are only point sources of light, even in the greatest of telescopes. Is it just the huge distance to the stars which reduce them to dots? Or is there some other optical explanation? I mean, the Sun is about as large as the Moon on the sky, but I cannot see any details on its surface because it blinds me. However, the next nearest star is invisible to the naked eye.  Some exoplanets have been directly imaged by removing the light from their star. It seems funny that we cannot detect any features on the photosphere of such a star, such as spots or flares or its shape. Plenty of photons are available.  Actually, there are several stars which have been directly imaged, maybe my sopposition is quite wrong: [website]"
3326,What is it like at the edge of the universe?,"If the universe is expanding, then if you were to be close to the edge of that expansion, what would it look like? What would be happening? Would it be chaotic? Would objects be appearing or disappearing? I don't even know if it's possible to have any knowledge of this, but I'd like to know if there are any theories. "
3327,Metal distribution in our solar system,"The sun dominates in our solar system. I wonder whether in every aspect the sun plays the most important role in our system.  For example, all kinds of metals are mainly located in the sun instead of the rest combined together in our system?   Is there any complementary relation between the sun and its children (all the planets, asteroids etc..)?   I mean: for one kind of metal, if the sun has more, her children should have less.  According to Abundance in the Sun of the elements, at least Li and Tb abundance of the sun are very low ([tex]). Furthermore, these abundances are from the solar atmosphere which is near the surface of the sun. "
3328,"If the expansion of the universe is speeding up, how long until everything nears the speed of light, and what would happen?","Since dark energy is causing everything to speed up infinitely, wouldn't everything near the speed of light? And since it's nearing the speed of light, wouldn't all kinds of strange things start happening such as time dilation? "
3329,Would blocking sunlight on Venus help make it habitable?,"Lets say we had the technology to create a mini-Dyson structure, like a shutter style curtain between the Sun and Venus, blocking the sunlight in a controllable manner to cool down it's temperature.  Could it be the first step to reverse the greenhouse effect and make Venus more ""terraformable""? Or at least more explorable like Mars? Would there be any unintended consequences? Would this be useful on other hot extra-solar earth-like planets? "
3330,Gravitational attraction of Sun on distant object,"A hypothetical situation which will help me with a real-life problem.  Several stationary objects are placed at great distances from our Sun -- say 0.1 light year, 0.5 ly, 1.0 ly. Assuming no other influences;  What velocity would each have when it reached the Sun? How long would each take to reach the Sun? Assuming the object-Sun path was perpendicular to the ecliptic &amp; the Sun had its actual motion, would the objects hit the Sun, or (roughly) by how much would they miss it? "
3331,Does habitable zone take tidally locked bodies into account?,"Imagine a tidally locked planet orbiting a red dwarf, where habitability is not situated close to terminator zone, but on a ""small"" cap normal to incident starlight (zenith) with permanent average +15 Celsius over the year, variations through year depending on orbit's eccentricity.   If there was in our solar system one (maybe not spherical) tidally locked body orbiting some close to circular orbit around the sun, how far from the sun would it be to meet those +15C average zenith cap temperature? Does it make habitable zone larger than it is?   "
3332,Where does the Solar System end?,"This is a question I've heard many times in the past, and a quick search of the site says it hasn't been asked here, so I figured I might as well ask (and answer) it. I know that it is rare for someone to ask and answer their own question, but I think it could work here, and I welcome input (including other answers) from anyone and everyone here.  The Sun is roughly 4 light-years away from the closest star system, the Alpha Centauri system. The planets in our Solar System, however, aren't even close to that far away from the Sun. Where does our Solar System end? Is the edge considered to be the orbit of Neptune, the Kuiper Belt, the Oort Cloud, or something else?  Note: this question on Physics SE is similar, but the answers posted here go in different directions. "
3333,"If two white dwarfs collided, would they become a star?","Would the temperatures during such a collision be able to ignite nuclear fusion, bringing the dead star back to life? If so, would it only be able to fuse for a short time before running out of fuel, or would it turn into a full-fledged star? "
3334,Is there a complete edition of the Cambridge Catalogue of Radio Sources (esp. 3C) available digitally?,"In radio astronomy, many common objects are refered to by their designation from the 3rd Cambridge Catalogue of Radio Sources, e.g. 3C 353.   For hobbyist purposes, I would like to create a catalogue for Cartes du Ciel that shows the location of the 3C objects. However, the catalogue exists in three versions, 3C from 1959 being the original, and 3CR (1962) and 3CRR (1983) updating the original.   Later surveys at different frequency bands used similar designations, e.g. 4C, 5C and so on.  Looking at the databases linked above, however, it seems that both only list the updates to the original catalogue (e.g. 3C 353 is listed in neither of them). Is there a digitized, comprehensive catalogue of all 3C objects? Or, even better, is there an archive where I could combine entries from several C surveys based on, say, 21cm flux? "
3335,How could the universe be a few light years across just 1 second after the big bang?,"I was skimming through Neil deGrasse Tyson's book Astrophysics for People in a Hurry when I noticed he says something curious on page 26:  ""By now, one second of time has passed [since the big bang]. The universe has grown a few light years across.""  How could the universe have expanded to a few light years in diameter in just one second if nothing can travel than light? By definition of a light year, wouldn't take a 1+ years for the universe to get this big? "
3336,How close to Earth were the asteroids moving through this Hubble composite image?,"Recently Hubble saw several asteroids traveling erratically through a deep field perspective.   What region of the sky is this, and how near were these asteroids to the Earth?  The photo is composed of multiple shots and the asteroids have copies because of Hubble's movement through frames as the photo assemblage shifted.   Was Hubble viewing towards the plane of the solar system and the asteroid belt? How did they explain that there were five in the same narrow frame?    [website]"
3337,Is Oumuamua tumbling?,"given that everyone wonders whether there is a chance that there is something to oumuamua that is not natural, what about tumbling (and/or aiming?)?  is there a natural gravitational or other force that would naturally stabilize non-orbiting asteroids in space?  I would guess that there is a chance that we could detect tumbling.  "
3338,How would water-ammonia oceans behave?,"Scientists strongly suspect that several moons in our solar system have frozen-over oceans of water-ammonia mixture. I've also read speculations on the possibility of surface water-ammonia oceans on exoplanets and exomoons. What I haven't seen a lot of is a discussion on how those oceans might behave differently than the water oceans of Earth.  More specifically, how would the surface water-ammonia ocean behavior differ from our water ocean behavior in terms of:    Ice(s) formation Evaporation Surface and underwater currents Varying ratios of water-ammonia based on temperature or other factors   I'd like to know if this has been studied and if these behaviors have been described in papers, books, or in-depth articles on this topic. Especially anyting that goes into the specifics of the water/ammonia ratios.    I'll add some personal speculation here. While it is not part of the primary question stated above, it helps to explain the type of problem I'm trying to understand, so may be helpful to narrow down which resources may be most useful.   When subject to increasing levels of heat would the ammonia molecules in the ocean evaporate before the water molecules, causing warmer areas of the ocean to have an increased amount of H2O relative to NH3? (And the cooler areas like the poles having an increasing ratio of NH3 to H2O). If the above was true, might the equatorial waters that have less NH3 facilitate the formation of water-ice? If so I could imagine exoplanets having water-ice-covered equators because they were warmer, and the cooler poles might be ice-free thanks to the greater amount of NH3 in the ocean. Would the ice formed on the ocean be composed of a molecular mix matching that of the ocean (with H2O and NH3 in the same ratio as the ocean), or would some molecules freeze-out first, possibly causing different layers or areas of varying types of ices? Might the poles of some water-ammonia planets have ""continents"" of water-ammonia ices that are frozen from ocean bed up to the surface (thanks to the fact that frozen ammonia is more dense than liquid, allowing for entire sections of ocean to freeze solid)?   If my speculation is correct (and I could be wildly wrong since I don't yet understand how a mix of water-ammonia actually behaves) then an exoplanet with an equatorial band of water-ice, mid-latitudes of liquid ocean, and solid polar-caps/continents of water/ammonia ices could be possible. The ammonia in the ocean would evaporate more quickly near the warmer equator, causing that area of a global ocean to have a greater ratio of H2O, and the ammonia precipitation and ocean might freeze at the poles, causing the build up of vast polar continents of ammonia/water ices. I would imagine the currents would function very differently than on earth, with surface and deep-level currents of varying ammonia-water ratios and temperatures. I I also see the possibility of frozen ocean beds in the more ammonia-heavy parts of an ocean, with the surface unfrozen.   Of course the ratio of ammonia to water will be very important. I'd love to see specific information on that!    Any informed clarification appreciated! "
3339,Any studies of the detection of dark matter in or near the solar system?,"Has there been any theoretical or observational study of the possibility of detecting ""local dark matter"", either within the solar system or near the Sun in interstellar space?  If so, what methods could possibly be used to detect it? "
3340,Why do scientists assume they can measure the shape of the universe if it is also widely believed to be infinite?,"The shape of the universe  is the question of whether the universe is flat, has a positive curvature or a negative one. More recently astronomers have compared radiation coming from extremely distant points of the observable universe and have concluded that it is flat with a 0.4% margin of error, Based on articles I've read elsewhere this seems to have created the consensus that the universe is indeed flat. But isn't the universe also believed to be infinite in size? If it is really infinite then shouldn't such measurements be inconsequential as an infinite curved universe would still appear perfectly flat to a local observer? "
3341,Age of the universe and time dilation,"   Given our knowledge and the standard cosmological model, we estimate that the age of the universe is about 13.7 billion years old.   How much sense does it make to talk about the age of the universe as a whole?  We can observe time dilation so we know time passes differently for observers moving at different speeds (special relativistic time dilation) or located at different distances from centres of strong gravitational fields (as explained by general relativity). Is the estimated age of the universe a property of the universe or of us as its observers?   Would a different observer perceive the age of the universe to be different? Do different parts of the universe have different ages? Do the principles of special relativity even apply when thinking on a universal scale? "
3342,"What are the raisons d'être for the Large Binocular Telescope ""binocularity""?","edit: The short form of the question is Why are there TWO telescopes?? A longer version follows.   The Large Binocular Telescope (and LBT blog as source of images below) has two 8.4 meter diameter mirrors, allowing for the possibility of interference in one dimension.  I'm aware that a single baseline, two-element stellar interferometer can be used to measure the separation between a pair of stars by looking at the Fourier transform of the intensity vs time of the interference. A single frequency peak is produced by one star, but if there are two close together, there will be ""beating"" in the time series that shows up as two peaks in the FT.   But I'm wondering if the LBT was designed and built with a plan to do more than that. Just for example, did plans include an ability to use interferometry to help reconstruct 2D images, or enhance the resolution beyond that which is already provided by the adaptive optics used in each half separately? Were there other plans or justifications?

3343,Photometry systems,"I know there's a difference between the ugriz and u'g'r'i'z' systems of photometric magnitude, but I also sometimes see UGRIZ written. Is there a difference between a UGRIZ magnitude and a ugriz magnitude?  I'm trying to apply the method from the paper Photometric Redshifts of Quasars (Richards et al. 2001, ApJ 122, 1151-1162, Equation 1) to my data, which contain data in U, B, V, R, etc. Do I need to do any transformations to my data in order to apply their equation?       First, we construct an empirical color-redshift [tex] (for each redshiftÈ indicated by the subscript z) is computed as      [tex]      where [tex] is the measured [tex] color of the object, [tex] is the color from the median color-redshift relation at a given redshift, [tex] is the photometric error in the [tex] color, which is given by [tex], and  [tex]  is the 1 [tex] error width of the median color-redshift relation as a function of redshift.

3344,Stars in multiple constellations,Are there examples of single stars that are a part of multiple constellations? What about stars that are part of one Western constellation and one non-Western?   Thanks in advance! 
3345,What would change if Venus rotated at a speed and direction similar to Earth?,"I am interested in two aspects of this question. Imagine that Venus had a similar rotation speed and the same direction of rotation that we have here on Earth.  What would change for Venus itself? I'm interested about changes in the core and mantle behaviour, a potential magnetosphere, changes in the atmosphere and tectonic plates.  What would be different for the other planets near the Sun? I'm interested about changes in gravitational resonance and potential orbit changes. "
3346,How could the polarizer in early coronagraphs make the Sun's corona more visible against the daytime sky?,"Wikipedia's Coronagraph; Invention says:     High Altitude Observatory's Mark IV Coronagraph on top of Mauna Loa, uses polarization to distinguish sky brightness from the image of the corona: both coronal light and sky brightness are scattered sunlight and have similar spectral properties, but the coronal light is Thomson-scattered at nearly a right angle and therefore undergoes scattering polarization, while the superimposed light from the sky near the Sun is scattered at only a glancing angle and hence remains nearly unpolarized.   How does this work?   For example, I looked at the daytime sky through a polarizing filter and I didn't notice substantial sky darkening? How could a polarizer have darkened the sky sufficiently to make the solar corona more visible? "
3347,How do we know how fast the surface of a neutron star is rotating?,"I understand that we can count pulses in time, but how do we know that the magnetosphere is rotating along with the surface of a neutron star?  Can we measure the rotation of a neutron star in any other way like red-blue shifts? It should be pretty difficult due to the small radius and big distance but is it possible? Is it already done? "
3348,Nature and mechanism of the short-term variability in radio strength of Sgr A*?,"The Phys.org article Cosmic filament probes our galaxy's giant black hole links to A Nonthermal Radio Filament Connected to the Galactic Black Hole? which discusses (among other things) the importance of achieving high dynamic range to study these filaments in the proximity of the strong emission associated with Sgr A*. It mentions the fluctuation of radio intensity from Sgr A* on time scales as short as five minutes (as well as to instrumental time-varying effects that also require attention and calibration).  The paper refers to Zhao et al. 2016, which in turn links to Zhao et al. 1999. But so far I can't track down either the nature of the short term variations seen in the radio brightness of Sgr A* nor the mechanism.  What is the nature of this variation (amplitude, power spectrum, any periodicity?) and what are the proposed mechanisms? "
3349,What is the time dilation less a magnetic field?,Does time dilation drop off like a gravity or does resemble a magnetic field model?    Could a smaller body with a magnetic field have more time dilation then a larger body without and to what degree? 
3350,Regions and size of an AGN,"In this diagram of the regions and approximate scale of an AGN:    which is from this paper, what do the x and y scales log(z/pc) and log(r/pc) mean? I'm guessing z is the z-direction ('upwards') and r is radius, but what is the meaning of the pc bit? "
3351,"Why do astronomers use the equatorial coordinate system that moves, instead of one based on fixed, distant stars?","As an outsider to the field, I am surprised to learn that astronomers commonly use the equatorial coordinate system, in which fixed stars are not actually fixed.  Isn't that making life harder than it needs to be? Why would one not define a coordinate system in terms of fixed stars?  For example like this: Fixed star A is defined as (0°, 0°), fixed star B is defined as (0°, X). That would constrain the 3 degrees of freedom of a spherical coordinate system.  Just to be clear, by fixed stars I mean stars that do not change their apparent relative position over long time scales, say a million years. So stars in the Milky Way would likely be excluded.  When making a new observation, these two reference stars may not be visible, which would make calibration difficult. But there could be a reference catalog of fixed stars with precisely known coordinates. Any new observation could be made relative to a visible subset of that catalog. This would be similar in principle to the International Temperature Scale of 1990, which defines temperature relative to a set of reference materials and states. "
3352,How big is the Andromeda galaxy in the night sky?,"If divide the distance to the sun by its diameter, I get the number 107.517 Likewise, if divide the distance to the moon by its diameter, I get the number 110.650  Both numbers are quite similar which means both objects look roughly the same size in the sky.  Now, I'll do the same calculation for the Andromeda galaxy. Distance: 2,537,000 light years Diameter: 220,000 light years  Quotient: 11.531  I get a number that's roughly 1/10th that of the moon. This means that Andromeda should look almost 10 times bigger than the moon or the sun.  Is this calculation correct? Does the Andromeda galaxy really look 10 times bigger than the moon in the night sky?  If it looks so big, why is it so difficult to see with the naked eye? "
3353,Is TDB monotonic? Does it or any of its derivatives have yearly discontinuities with respect to an atomic clock?,"This in-depth answer mentions that      ...TDB is updated every year. As technology improves, these subtle updates change the timing of past events.    This makes me wonder...   Does this updating result in yearly discontinuities in TDB relative to a smoothly-running (non-discontinuous) atomic clock? If not, does it result in discontinuities in the first derivative of the difference? Is TDB ever non-monotonic?  "
3354,Telescope light gathering power and resolution,"I'm a little confused. Could you help me?  The question is; If we increase the radius of a telescope twice, how much does the light gathering power change? What about resolution?  Is it increase 2^2? For second part i know As the diameter of the telescope's objective increases, the resolving power increases.  Thanks "
3355,"Critical density of the universe (no, not that one)?","I seem to recall reading something that said if the density of the universe was off by as little as one atom per cubic meter, the universe, as we know it, would not exist; one less and there wouldn't have been enough gravity to form galaxies and stars, one more and there would have been too much matter. (I don't know (or remember) what would have happened in the case of too much matter.)If I Google the title of this question, all I get is stuff about the expansion of the universe, nothing about whether or not it would exist. I've tried other variations but can't seem to find anything.Did I grossly misinterpret this? If not, does anyone know of any articles that can confirm or refute this?  "
3356,Why are Shack-Hartmann sensors so expensive (4k+ USD)?,"Recently I am searching for a Shack-Hartmann wavefront sensor for university laboratory usage. I was expecting my target sensor to be cheap, which is:   Low spatial wavefront resolution (50 x 50) for beam measurement; Low frame rate; Portable design, and easy to use.   Most quotations are beyond my expectation. On ThorLabs it costs 4k USD (which is, ""cheaper"" compared to most competitors): [website]Following reasons may to blame for this high price:   Expensive industrial sensors. But for [website]Microlens array (MLA) fabrication? MLA-sensor alignment? Software development? (SDK &amp; GUI)   But I am not convinced by myself.   Any ideas why a Shack-Hartmann sensor is so expensive? "
3357,Speed of Moonrise relative to fixed point on ground,"Due to the curvature of the earth, and the way the moon interacts with the atmosphere (especially close to the horizon), is there a known function that describes the speed of the moon relative to its angle in the sky?  For bonus points, imagine that you are at altitude in a plane, and for some reason want to descend at a rate that would keep the total % of the moon illuminated constant. Is there a function for that?  Thank you in advance, this is not for an assignment, just for my own curiosity as I watched moonrise tonight. I have tried googling these questions, to no avail.  "
3358,"Finding hour angle, altitude","I know the latitude and longitude of a city ([tex] N, [tex] W), the declination and right ascension of a star([tex], [tex]) and the local time, date (27.12.2017, 1:20 AM).

3359,Is there a physical limit to how far we can go?,"Is there a physical limit to how far we can go?  I am thinking there could be based on the following:  1: There are parts of the universe expanding faster than the speed of light that we will never be able to get to (without faster than light travel)  2: There are a finite number of galaxies between here and the distance where 1 takes place.  3: If we travel even at the speed of light, it seems we would at some point pass that finite number of galaxies, and wouled not be able to reach the next one!  Does this mean there is a limit to how far we can go, and furthermore, we will experience the “big rip”? "
3360,Can you create a black hole using kinetic energy?,"Imagine you have a particle accelerator that you can crank up to arbitrarily high energies.  Because of General Relativity, the particles get heavier and heavier as you dump more energy into them.  Will these particles ever become a black hole from this relativistic mass?  If so, what will an observer particle moving parallel to the black hole, just below that speed, see?  What I'm getting at is, kinetic energy is relative.  So therefore relativistic mass is as well.  So would these particles be black holes to some observers but not others? "
3361,Which star / galaxy is moving away from us the fastest?,"I know that we have measured the rate a lot of stars and galaxies move away from us using the doppler shift, and I know that the further a star / galaxy is the faster they accelerate away from us due to space inflation. I'm wondering, did anyone categorise which star / galaxy is moving towards us / away from us the fastest? How fast are they going in relation to our solar system? "
3362,Is there a maximum size for a black hole?,"As far as I understand it black holes radiate Hawking radiation and probably gravity waves, which over time causes them to lose mass and eventually evaporate after almost unfathomable amounts of time.  I've also read that black holes eventually have difficulty gaining size after a certain point because gravitational forces working in a black hole's accreditation disk can eventually begin ejecting in-falling matter before it can be absorbed.  While I know black holes can become quite massive, that leads me to wonder if Black holes have a maximum possible size where they will begin to immediately radiate any additional mass that's added to it.  Or can a black hole effectively expand forever as long as the supply of matter is greater than the effects of radiation and ejection?  Is there effectively a size limit to black holes? "
3363,Can Liquid Water exist on Mars?,"Outside of a specially crafts environment, could liquid water exist on Mars? Not some time in the distant past, but within the last few years. Mars' atmosphere is too thin for water to exist, right?  Perhaps if the water was mixed with salts or other minerals, its sublimation point might be altered enough to exist? Mars can get warm during its summer days, up to about 20 degrees Celsius at the equator. Perhaps, in certain areas and time periods, we may get a kind of liquid water?  Sorry for the speculative nature of this question, but after NASA talked about the possibility of liquid water, it got me wondering if it was possible. "
3364,What if the atmosphere of Titan were like the one on Venus?,"The current mean temperature in Titan is &minus;180 ºC (93 K), the same as in Saturn.  But I was wondering what would be the case if the atmosphere of Titan would be like the Venus atmosphere, whose composition is mainly CO2 and has a pressure of 90 bar, instead of approximately 1.5 bar.  What temperature could Titan reach in that case? Would the greenhouse effect allow the moon to be heated enough to maintain liquid water or is it too far from the Sun to be affected by any kind of greenhouse effect? Maybe the latest question allows to ask another one: How far from the Sun could Venus be so it can have temperatures above 0 ºC?  The question may be answered given two possible alternatives:   Same composition as Venus, but same pressure as in Titan. Same composition and pressure as in Venus.  "
3365,Computing the average hours of sunshine at given location&orientation,"I made it my geeky aim to see which of two flats that we are considering moving into is sunnier. The first flat faces S and the second faces NNW; both are at the same height above ground and have similar terrain (buildings/trees) around.  Conventional wisdom would suggest the S-facing one is (much) sunnier, but I am not sure if this is really so, since I don't think it is the case that the Sun, when it's above the horizon, spends most of its time in the Southern-hemispace/hemifield.   Furthermore, I'd like to get a more quantitative estimate of how much direct sunlight each flat gets per day (averaged across seasons). How can I use tools available on the Internet (probably GoogleMaps-based) to find this out?  My only solution to date was to generate Sun trajectories (elliptics) for each flat, using the SunCalc.net website; these suggest the NNW-facing flat hardly ever sees the sun, except around the summer solstice. Is this a reliable estimate, or can anyone suggest another way to solve this riddle? "
3366,Is the shortest day duration constant?,"Is the exact duration of the shortest day of a year (at the winter solstice in the northern hemisphere) always the same, for given latitude and longitude, or does it fluctuate? If it does, what is the range? "
3367,"""Pluto Time"" for any solar system body","A while back NASA made a site called Pluto Time, where you can enter your address and find that ""...moment near dawn and dusk each day, where the illumination on Earth matches that of high noon on Pluto.""  Is there a generic formula where we can calculate this for any body in the solar system?  How about any body around any star?  (Not sure about that apparent-magnitude tag. I think that might mean something else.) "
3368,"How bright would it be on the ""face"" of Titan","If you were planing a maned mission to Titan and wanted to find a landing site that would get the most visible light for the longest amount of time, your first logical choice would be the dark side of the moon since it faces the sun for a longer duration than the face would. (""face"" and ""dark side"" corresponding to the colloquial definitions they have when referring to our moon) Also, unlike the on the face, you wouldn't have to worry about Saturn eclipsing the sun. This would put you in a range of brightness roughly equivalent of twilight on Earth due to the distance of the sun and the thick atmosphere of Titan.   But how bright would Saturn be when reflected on the face of Titan? Would it be bright enough to see anything if you wanted to go there, or would you need flashlights and night vision goggles? "
3369,Does anybody recognize this kind of prism?,"Supplemental to this answer to Did Edmund Scientific 4¼ inch Newtonians have 90° prisms as secondary mirrors in the 1970's?

It doesn't look like a simple right-angle prism, but possibly something that has additional reflections and does some additional flipping or rotation.

3370,At what depth below the Sun's surface does the density reach that of water?,I'd like to write a short supplementary answer to A probe floating in Sun's surface but in order to do so I need to know at roughly what depth relative to the Sun's surface the mass density reaches 1 g/cm^3.  At the bottom of the photosphere the density seems to be either 1E-06 or 1E-09 g/cm^3 as discussed in the question What is the density profile within the Sun's photosphere? but how deep do you have to go below that to reach 1 g/cm^3? 
3371,Behaviour of black holes,"This question could be strictly linked to my another question related to black holes.  It’s known that the  horizon event is a place where dust,star components are ready to be incorporated to the black hole*.  Actually, my question can be divided in few points:   Might be reasonable to believe that ,if it’s true that in many spiral galaxies there is a black hole in the middle, could these objects have so a powerful gravitational force to consider them the creators of the galaxies? (*) when the black holes are sucking up dust from the horizon event, are they increasing their mass?   If so, it’s reasonable to believe that their gravitational force will increase in a way to attract farther objects? Could they eject the dust or anything else if they are “eating” so much?       This can be in contradiction with above point.   "

3374,How young could the asteroid belt be?,"I heard a theory (possibly from a crackpot) that there was an event in our solar system where two objects collided and created the asteroid belt, the orbits of some of the planets were altered, and that this event took place late enough for homo sapiens to have referenced observations made during the previous orbit in their oral traditions. (Mars parsing close enough to Earth for people to observe its moons)  Is any of this possible given readily observable evidence? Are asteroid belts ever created in this way? "
3375,Where is the exomoon? (Possible discovery of a companion to Kepler-1625b),"The new paper in Science Advances Evidence for a large exomoon orbiting Kepler-1625b (open access!) uses a sophisticated combination of occultation light curve simulation, signal processing and statistical analysis to show that there is a significant chance that they have identified an exomoon, a moon orbiting an exoplanet.  But it's too sophisticated for me to understand how this Hubble data indicates a potential moon. Terms like ""detrending"",  ""Markov chain Monte Carlo"", and ""Bayesian evidences"" are beyond me.  Is it possible to choose one of those plots and add an arrow to say ""this blip here, this is Kepler-1625b potential moon""? If not, is it possible to at least explain in a simple way what it is from this analysis that has led them to believe there may be a moon there?  Abstract:     Exomoons are the natural satellites of planets orbiting stars outside our solar system, of which there are currently no confirmed examples. We present new observations of a candidate exomoon associated with Kepler-1625b using the Hubble Space Telescope to validate or refute the moon’s presence. We find evidence in favor of the moon hypothesis, based on timing deviations and a flux decrement from the star consistent with a large transiting exomoon. Self-consistent photodynamical modeling suggests that the planet is likely several Jupiter masses, while the exomoon has a mass and radius similar to Neptune. Since our inference is dominated by a single but highly precise Hubble epoch, we advocate for future monitoring of the system to check model predictions and confirm repetition of the moon-like signal.

If method 2 can detect signal that are half a magnitude larger, i.e. fainter, let's say x.5 mag, is it correct to say that method 2 can detect signals that are about 60% fainter than what method 1 can detect?  Is the 60% correct? I got this number by converting the magnitudes [tex] to flux [tex], i.e. [tex] [tex]  Thus, [tex] is about [tex] which means about [tex] fainter. I have never worked with magnitudes before, so is this a valid statement? "
3382,Stellar electromagnetic signatures,"By using only the electromagnetic signature of a star, could a star be distinguished with reliable accuracy from any other star? To elaborate a little, say we have a collection of about 200,000 stars. By using EM spectrum alone (and any means of analysis, such as spectral analysis), and by tagging each star with its corresponding EM signature, could there be similarities too close to fail a distinction between any two or more stars?    Now, of course, I know that such a thing is possible. I'm not asking whether it is possible. I just want to know the odds of such a lack of distinction, considering all the factors of stellar evolution. It's either in the ballpark or not. "
3383,When did the Scutum constellation receive its current name?,"While cleaning my desk, I found an out of date star map (puts the cleaning into perspective, huh?) where the Scutum constellation is still referred to as Scutum Sobiescianum).  This is the original name Johannes Hevelius gave it in 1684  My map is (unfortunately) modern and comes from the 2nd half of the 20th century. It's a Polish one so it's not odd for it to still use the traditional name. The main illustration of the Scutum article in Polish Wikipedia happens to do so as well.    I know the name of the constellation has been changed but I can't find any information on who did it and when. I suppose it must have been the IAU (International Astronomical Union) but I have no idea regarding the time of the change.  When was the English name of the constellation officially changed and who did it? "

I know Jupiter radiates more heat than it receives from the Sun. "

I imagine just less colourful and and more sparse, but seeing whole galaxies instead of individual stars?  Or would moving the solar system into a void just mean the end of the world as we know it? "
3387,Can any stars ever form supermassive black holes?,"I heard that most supermassive blackholes are not formed by stars – in fact, we aren't even sure how they're formed. But could a star, with enough mass and low enough metallicity, form a supermassive black hole? Rather, would there be any stars that fit this category? "
3388,How could we detect planets orbiting black holes?,"Detecting planets orbiting around stars can be made with several methods, transit photometry seems to be by far the most popular method nowadays.   I wonder how we could detect planets orbiting black holes. Which methods are we left with? Has it been done before?   "
3389,How long time since a typical asteroid collided with another asteroid?,How pristine and ancient are asteroids really? I suppose they melt and reform when they collide with each other. How frequently do they collide with each other? 
3390,What is the largest (angular) dark area in the sky?,"Question  Within our current knowledge, what is the largest (circular, say) area in the sky which is empty/dark? I'm thinking in terms of angular size.  Motivation  I was wondering what was the largest star as seen from the Earth, other than the Sun of course, in terms of milliarcseconds, say. A search quickly turned up R Doradus which is huge (57 mas as seen from the Earth). But I wondered if it was possible to rule out any (angularly) larger dark objects by finding stars whose light would be blocked if there was such an object.  Of course we should eventually be able to rule out each such area -- as Hubble Deep Field showed, if you look long enough there's a lot to find everywhere -- but relative to our current knowledge, what are the largest gaps?  I expect that the answer would be in a region which has been missed by a sky survey and which coincidentally doesn't have anything we can see. "
3391,Is there a limit to how fast spacetime can bend/warp around an accelerating object?,"If in the future a spaceship can accelerate to nearly the speed of light, will it encounter any kind of resistance/drag from the spacetime in front of it not being able to bend/warp fast enough around it?  It is my understanding that as an object accelerates, its mass will increase and this increase in mass should result in the object having more gravity, and this gravity will continue to increase as the object's speed increases. The creation of more and more gravity should result in an increased area of spacetime surrounding the object being bent/warped.  So, if there is a limit to how fast spacetime can bend/warp around an accelerating object, along with an increased area of spacetime being affected by an accelerating object's increased gravity, will this spaceship start to heat up and begin to melt the faster it accelerates?  "
3392,How to calculate the S/N of IFU or long-slit galaxy observations,"I would like to calculate the Signal-to-Noise ratio (SNR) of long-slit or integral field unit (IFU) observations of H[tex] emission. I can calculate the SNR or each individual spectrum, just fine. However, how can I assign a single SNR value to an observation? Do I just quote the higher SNR or do I calculate the median/mean SNR of all spectra? Is there a convention for this? My data is low-redshift galaxy IFU observations, and thus the SNR is higher in the center of the galaxy and lower at larger radii. "
3393,How Would a Neutron Star Actually Appear?,"Having seen many pictures produced by artists of neutron stars and planets that orbit some of them, I was wondering how a pulsar would appear to a human being, in visible light (assuming the intense radiation etc. doesn't kill us in the process).  As I understand, the pulsar's beam is projected from the star's magnetic poles rather than rotational poles, which are not necessarily in line with each other. Given that pulsars rotate extremely quickly and the beam could be visible across vast distances - such as if it were shining through the pulsar's nebula - would it appear as a straight line, curved line or perhaps a cone? This is assuming the beam can be seen in visible light.  Given the incredible density of neutron stars and their small physical sizes, would the night sky be visibly distorted to the point where (for example) just after sunset on a hypothetical planet, one could possibly observe other planets near or behind the star that would otherwise be blocked by it?  Given their small surface areas, would a neutron star still appear as luminous as say, the Sun, at a similar distance? How close would you have to get to a neutron star for its apparent magnitude to match the Sun's from Earth? "
3394,Why is it always planets orbiting stars?,"In our solar system, there are 8 planets orbiting a star, the Sun. And I understand that there are about 500 confirmed solar systems out there.   But why is it always planets orbiting stars? Why can't it be several stars orbiting a planet, or a star orbiting a star? Why is a star by definition stationary as opposed to planets which are moving.  Of course, in that case, it wouldn't make much sense to call it a solar system, but still. "
3395,What are the real conditions for the creation of an atmosphere/loss of an existing atmosphere?,"Overview:  Taking a planet Ganymede for example (moon, technically I suppose). Ganymede is huge (well, in contrast to other bodies) and I've noticed a pattern between larger bodies and atmospheres. Usually it seems that the larger a body is, the more likely it will have an atmosphere (I know this isn't true, but it definitely seems true, with obvious exceptions). Even when playing Kerbal space program I came up on Vall expecting to be slowed due to its huge size. Big mistake, slammed into the surface. So, if size isn't the end-all-be-all of why a planet would have an atmosphere, what really causes it? Why wouldn't something like Ganymede, doubly protected by it's own magnetic field and Jupiter's field not have an atmosphere? What causes the planet to lose it once an atmosphere is created?   You can ignore my overview rambling, I suppose my one-liner focused question is:  What are the real conditions for the creation of an atmosphere/loss of an existing atmosphere? "
3396,"Why do these astronomers say that ""Carbon chains with more than nine atoms are unstable""?","The Phys.org article Interstellar iron isn't missing, it's just hiding in plain sight links to the paywalled article On the Structure, Magnetic Properties, and Infrared Spectra of Iron Pseudocarbynes in the Interstellar Medium (Tarakeshwar, Buseck and Timmes, Arizona State University), and says:     The new work may also solve another longstanding puzzle. Carbon chains with more than nine atoms are unstable, the team explains. Yet observations have detected more complex carbon molecules in interstellar space. How nature builds these complex carbon molecules from simpler carbon molecules has been a mystery for many years.      Buseck explained, ""Longer carbon chains are stablized by the addition of iron clusters."" This opens a new pathway for building more complex molecules in space, such as polyaromatic hydrocarbons, of which naphthalene is a familiar example, being the main ingredient in mothballs.      Said Timmes, ""Our work provides new insights into bridging the yawning gap between molecules containing nine or fewer carbon atoms and complex molecules such as C60 buckminsterfullerene, better known as 'buckyballs.'""   Question: On Earth we don't see a big difference between hydrocarbon chains with lengths below and above 9 (think kerosene, wax...), why is there such a cutoff in stability in interstellar space? What is it about hydrocarbon chains longer than 9 atoms that makes them unstable there but not here? "
3397,Orbital elements of solar system using Pyephem,"I'm using the astrometric python module Pyephem, and I would like to get the orbital (keplerian) elements for the  solar system planets.   The only values I found is the heliocentric latitude, longitude, and the distance to the sun. Is there a way to compte the orbital parameters based on thoses values ? Did I missed a function in Pyephem ?  "
3398,How frequently does a comet drastically change its orbit in the Solar System (like 67P did in 1959)?,"Comet 67P/Churyumov–Gerasimenko flew by Jupiter at only 0.05 AU distance in 1959. This encounter lowered its perihelion from 2.7 to 1.3 AU (almost becoming an Earth crossing comet). Since it happens to be the target of the Rosetta mission (and was picked only because of a launch delay), I wonder if it is as common as it seems that a 4+ billion year old comet shifted its orbit drastically less than 60 years ago?  How often does Jupiter do something like this?  How many known comets are known to have had their orbits substantially changed by a single flyby? "
3399,Do all planets rotate in the same direction in relation to each other?,"In other words, does everything spin counterclockwise according to their axes (in relation to each other)? I suppose my question goes for stars, moons and other objects too.   But then again, all you have to do is look at any rotation upside down and it goes clockwise. So depending how you're looking at it, one could say everything rotates in the same direction whether they do or not. It's all a matter of perspective, right? And in space, there is no ""right side up"". Maybe my question is moot now that I think about it.  If we re-drew all of Earth's maps and globes upside down, New York or Sydney would be on the ""west coast"" and the Sun would rise in the ""west"" and set in the ""east"". Is it just by luck or maybe by the prominent early mapmakers, or that the majority of human population lives in the Northern Hemisphere, that it's given ""dominance"" on ""top""? (I've heard that theory before)  Ugh. This is all so confusing. "
3400,How to identify component of velocity of a star from its red shift?,"When a telescope observes a distant star, all it sees is the light being emitted by the star. Observing the wavelength of this light, we determine the velocity of the star. If the wavelength is red-shifted (longer) then the star is moving away from us, and if the wavelength is blue-shifted (shorter) then the star is moving towards us.  But how do we know that the wavelength that we see is not the red shifted wavelength but the original wavelength emitted by the star? Do we already know what wavelength of light the star is supposed to emit (if yes, how?)  Also, using this method we should be able to identify only the radial component of velocity. Because the tangential component of velocity of the star would have no effect on the wavelength that we observe? So how do we determine the actual velocity (including the proper direction) of the star? "
3401,At what rate are stars accelerating?,How fast stars accelerating away from a central point? Are they increasing in acceleration or decreasing? If possible could you please provide a plot of the acceleration of stars away from the central fixed point. 
3402,Could the E.H.T. produce an image of the human artifacts on the moon?,"Two days ago the New York Times featured the Event Horizon Telescope (E.H.T.), a huge virtual radio telescope emerging from combining data from several dishes scattered around the world. While the E.H.T. is designed and built to observe black holes, specifically Sagittarius A*, the article claimed that the E.H.T. could ""spot a doughnut on the moon"".  This was probably just meant as an illustration of its enormous resolution, but: Could it? I'm aware that the moon is not a radio source but it was apparently possible to make radar images of its surface using reflected radar radiation from one of the involved dishes. Would something like that be possible with the E.H.T.? Could we ""see"" the landing sites from earth? Left behind rovers, descent and ascent stages? "
3403,Astronomy online degrees,"I have a masters degree in computer science and statistics but would like to advance my knowledge in astronomy, ideally in getting some kind of online degree.   Does anybody have experience, suggestions or recommendation where I can do what without having to be physically present at a university?   Also, I would like to get view on what specific topics in astronomy it would make sense to focus if my skills are mainly in computer science and data analysis?  "
3404,What exactly is 'eastward movement',"I am reading a book on spherical astronomy. Surprisingly, my problem is not with the mathematics. The author mentions several times words like 'eastward movement' and 'westward movement'. For example, the Earth revolves around the Sun in an eastward direction. When I look at the diagram from the perspective of someone above the north pole of the Sun, the Earth seems to go around the Sun in an anticlockwise manner. My problem is I don't understand what is meant by eastward movement ? Can someone explain what this means without ambiguity ? Is there some sort of a right-hand rule that one can follow such as Fleming's right-hand rule in electricity ? "
3405,Why do we believe that the super massive black holes at the centers of two merging galaxies would themselves merge?,"When listening to podcasts or watching youtube videos of astronomers discussing galaxy mergers, I often hear talk about how the super massive black holes at their centers will themselves merge during or shortly after the collision. Why do we believe this to be the case?  A priori, I would expect SMBH's to behave the same as all other galactic objects. They might be extraordinarily massive, but physically they are still minuscule compared to the vast empty space between stars in a galaxy. Collisions between objects (not counting gigantic clouds of gas and dust) would be extraordinarily rare, so why do we make an exception for the SMBH's?  I could see a case for them merging in the (rare?) instance where the host galaxies hit each other in such a way that the mutual center of mass happens to coincide with their individual centers of mass. In that case, the SMBH's could be close enough to orbit about one another, losing energy to gravitational waves and eventually merging. I would think that this scenario is rather rare, however. I find it more plausible that an average galaxy merger would leave the SMBH's independently orbiting the center of the combined galaxy, too far apart to lose any significant kinetic energy to gravitational waves.  The astronomers who talk about galactic mergers know a heck of a lot more than I do about the subject, so I presume there are flaws in my assumptions or my understanding of the physics. What am I missing? "
3406,Is Barnard 68 the only cloud so close to us that there are no stars between us and it?,"Regarding molecular clouds / absorption nebulae / Bok globules / obscuring clouds,  (I'm not sure if there's one generic term encompassing all those and any similar obscuring clouds - I just used ""cloud"" in the question title),  is Barnard 68 the only one so close to us that there are no stars between us and it?  If not, what is the list of such?  (Are we observationally confident about this, at this stage?)    I guess a related question would be: ""about what is the density of bok globules near us?"" ... in a cube of 1000pc on a side, about how many bok globules are we talking? One or two or thousands??

3407,Will LSST make a significant increase in the rate of astronomical event alerts?,"The NPR news article and podcast New Telescope Promises To Revolutionize Astronomy updates the status of the ""Large Synoptic Survey Telescope under construction on Cerro Pachón in Chile"".  NPR's Joe Palca's piece includes sound bites from astronomers, including Caltech astronomer Mansi Kasliwal:     PALCA: Kasliwal says although LSST will detect these events, other telescopes are better suited to study them in detail. So the plan is to send out an alert to other telescopes when LSST sees something interesting. Of course, that means the other telescope has to drop what it was doing, but Kasliwal says it will be worth it.   Isn't the LSST expected to ""see something interesting"" quite often?  Due to the size and scope of LSST's surveying capability which is due to it's huge corrected field of view and huge focal plane array and huge image processing and event detection capacity, there is a potential for a significant increase in the rate of alerts generated and sent to observatories and to astronomers' cell phones (one notable example of such things).  Question: Will LSST make a significant increase in the rate of astronomical event alerts? Has there been an estimate of how the overall rate will change when it comes online?   I'm wondering if astronomers will get woken up more often by their phones, or if some observatories will have to make the decision to promptly change observing schedules or not much more frequently. "
3408,A camera and time dilation?,"If I travelled near a black hole, my time would progress slower relative to someone on Earth. This is clear enough. However, what if we sent a probe with a camera to a black hole? When we watch the screen, would we see time through the camera's perspective — that is, would the Universe appear to progress faster as the probe got closer and closer to the black hole? "
3409,"Is there a standardized ""Astronomical Alert"" system?","“Who saw” the binary neutron star merger first? What was the sequence of events? (GRB/GW170817) highlights a particularly notable astronomical alert, but I am sure that there are alerts triggered by various systems sent to various other systems.   Question: Is there a standardized ""Astronomical Alert"" system? Or are there many decentralized and specialized systems for each of various specific scenarios, such as the one described in Does the Zwicky Transient Facility only run when triggered by a cell phone?  The question occurred to me after posting Will LSST make a significant increase in the rate of astronomical event alerts? "
3410,Which constellations are straight up and straight down?,"Pretend you're in our galaxy near Earth and you're standing upright wrt the flat galactic disk.  If you look directly towards the center of the galaxy, that's Sagittarius. If you swivel your head and look directly away from the center, I believe that's around Auriga.  In fact, if you look straight up, about which constellation is that?  And if you look straight down?  (If I'm not mistaken, could be wrong, this is equivalent to asking about...    Wikipedia explanation of galactic coordinates  ... galactic coordinates of longitude zero, latitude 90° (up overhead) and -90° (down through your feet). "
3411,Gyrochronology?,"I recently became aware of the work of the Kepler Cluster Study. In January of this year it was announced that a long awaited method of finding ages of ""cool"" stars is now available. This is huge and I'm surprised that I just found out about it.   I wonder if there has been a little too much ""extrapolation"" and that more data is needed. I also wonder if they have gotten around the fact that it is vsini that is being measured and not the actual rotation velocity.  The bottom line is that I want to see the catalogs of updated ages based on this new information. Does anybody know of any such publications in the works? It will be interesting to compare results to ages based on metallicity. "
3412,"Which things can LIGO see that LISA can't, and vice-versa?","CNET's Astronomers discover two ferociously fast stars locked in a death spiral quotes Kevin Burdge, lead author on the new paper in Nature  General relativistic orbital decay in a seven-minute-orbital-period eclipsing binary system (no ArXiv?) and a Ph.D. candidate in physics at Caltech as saying:     LIGO can see things that LISA can't, and LISA can see some things that LIGO can't, and there are a handful of things that might switch from being visible in LISA to LIGO over time""   Is there a simple way to understand which ""things"" fall into which categories?

3413,What is the gravitational force felt on Earth from the other planets in our solar system?,"How much gravitational force is felt on earth from the other planets in the solar system? The sun exerts the strongest g-force, holding us in it's orbit, followed by the moon which affects the tides on earth, but how much force do we feel from Jupiter, Saturn, Venus, etc? "
3414,Do the magnetic fields of stars and/or other planets reverse?,I've heard of the magnetic field of the earth reversing poles over the course of thousands of years but do stars and other planets (specifically gas giants) also experience this? If so how does it differ and if not why? 
3415,Tycho Brahe's model,"Tycho Brahe made a model of universe where earth is at the centre and motionless whereas all other planet orbited around the sun.  I am interested to know how he came to this model? If it is because of parallax then how could he observe parallax as there was no telescope?  From here:     Brahe also noted that previous measurements of the planets, as recorded in the texts of the time, were incorrect. With his new measuring devices, he was able to record the position of the planets with the best possible accuracy for naked eye observations - ten times more accurately than people had been getting until then.      Even with his high quality observations, Brahe was not able to detect any changes in the positions of the stars over the year, which should occur if the Earth revolves around the Sun. If he had, this would have constituted direct proof of the Earth's motion. This parallax effect was not detected by astronomers until the 19th century.   "
3416,Where exactly is the modification that first corrected the spherical aberration in Hubble's primary mirror?,"The April 2015 CBS News article How NASA fixed Hubble's flawed vision - and reputation describes the modification taken to the Hubble Space Telescopes by the Space Shuttle that was used to correct for the strong spherical aberration of the primary mirror due a highly accurate but incorrect figure.    above: ""Due to an oversight during fabrication, the concave shape of Hubble's primary mirror was too shallow toward its outer edges by 2 microns, a tiny fraction of the width of a human hair. As a result, starlight was not brought to a focus at the same point, resulting in blurry images. These three images show the same star as viewed from a ground-based telescope, left, and from Hubble's uncorrected mirror, center. The corrected image, after a space shuttle repair mission in 1993, is seen on the right"" from here. credit: NASA  From the article:     But the mirror's biggest impact was on the Wide Field Planetary Camera, the instrument expected to provide the dazzling visible and near-infrared images most easily understandable by the public and of tremendous value to astronomers.      ""The real killer was Jim Westphal (the WFPC principal investigator at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California), who tended to be very negative,"" Weiler recalled. ""Basically, he said he couldn't do anything. So that's what I was preparing to walk into the press conference with.""      But as it turned out, Weiler had two aces up his sleeve. One he knew about, one he didn't.      The ace he knew about was drawn seven years earlier, when Weiler kicked off work to build a backup camera, the Wide Field Planetary Camera 2, a carbon copy of the original. John Trauger was the principal investigator, the man in charge of the instrument at JPL.      The ace Weiler didn't yet realize was built into the design of Trauger's camera.      Shortly after the first light image came down, ""one of the grand old men of optics here at JPL, Aden Meinel, he and his wife Marjorie wanted to see what the image looked like,"" Trauger said in an interview. ""We brought it up on the screen. ... And he looked at that for five minutes and he said 'that looks like spherical aberration.'      ""That was the first time I heard spherical aberration,"" Trauger recalled. ""The thing was, he also said 'well, if it is spherical aberration, you could fix it with Wide Field Planetary Camera 2.' He knew that we had these nickel-sized mirrors in our optical system, which received a sharp image of the primary mirror itself. ... The very last mirror before the image is created on our CCD was an opportunity to straighten the wavefront out. He recognized that, too.""      By giving that mirror a prescription that exactly countered the spherical aberration in the primary mirror, the WFPC 2 would be able to achieve a perfect focus and do all of the science that was intended.   Question: Where exactly is the modification that first corrected the spherical aberration in Hubble's primary mirror? Can it be identified within the image below, or is it located elsewhere? Was the modification only a change in the figure of one of the small mirrors, or were other optical elements modified as well as part of the correction?    above: ""The business end of COSTAR: Small mirrors on motorized arms directed corrected light into the Hubble Space Telescope's spectrographs and faint object camera. COSTAR and the Wide Field Planetary Camera 2 were installed during a 1993 shuttle mission, correcting Hubble's flawed vision."" From here. Eric Long/Smithsonian Institution "
3417,How feasible is it that we could see the Central Black Hole Sgr A* occlude one of it's closely orbiting stars?,"I'm thinking about the recent famous photo of a black hole, some months ago. It got me wondering if there isn't a way to more easily make a direct observation of these.   We detect exoplanets in part by phenomenae that occur when they transit their star.  We also have excellent time lapse photography of numerous stars orbiting the Milky Way's central Black Hole (Sgr A*), with timescales quite amenable to human timescales.  Could we observe Sgr A* directly by observing one of these stars passing behind, or almost behind it?  The diameter of the BH is estimated at 60m km, more than 40x the diameter of our sun (1.4m km). At that distance, parallax related effects and relative sizes wouldn't be an issue, as the star and BH are virtually at the same distance both very far from earth. A star also wouldn't have to be occluded, just pass close enough behind, for gravitational lensing to be detected on that fraction of its orbit (but not other places).    Additionally, a star could also be occluded by an accretion disk (if any), and its light affected in a way that would presumably show something of the nature of what it was passing behind. Admittedly Sgr A* may have little or no disk, but we might detect a disk of low enough density/size/activity not to be active, if a residual disk did in fact exist.  Are we likely to be able to see in time lapse photography, stars vanishing and reappearing behind an apparently empty patch of space, in this way? Has it been done? "
3418,How quickly does a supernova heat up/expand?,"Suppose there's a star out there that's a lot more massive than the Sun.  Suppose further that orbiting this star is a planet not unlike Earth. Water, oxygen, civilization, and all.  Now the star decides to go supernova. How quick, or slow, is the process?  How long will it take it to heat up to make life on that planet impossible? A month? A year? A hundred years? A thousand years?  And how long will it take for the supernova to engulf the planet? A day? A month? A year? A million years? "

3420,Period coincidence of Planet Nine with furthest Kuiper belt objects,"A lead scientist of the Planet Nine theory said that ""The period with which it goes around the sun is a rational multiple of the periods of all the furthest Kuiper Belt objects""  To what degree of precision can Konstantin Batygin make that kind of measurement? Has it been backed up by other physicists with a degree of certainty?  He also says that they think it's near it's aphelion ""because it hasn't been seen, so it's far away"", not because of the above period coincidence, why can't they say where it is more convincingly?  Does that mean that they have very strong mathematical evidence for Planet Nine? "
3421,Why doesn't Jupiter increase the chances of an asteroid to strike the Earth?,"I often hear the hypothesis that Jupiter decreases the chances of an asteroid strike on the Earth, but my question is, why does it only decrease the chances ?

3429,"Expected nature of LISA's data; will it be more like a forest of static peaks, or a series of individual events?","@RobJeffries' clear answer to Which things “LIGO can see things that LISA can't”, and vice-versa? explains that the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna or LISA will only be sensitive to gravitational waves with frequencies below about 1 Hz and so will be sensitive to much slower rotating objects than those that LIGO records.     Lower frequency GWs can only be seen with LISA. This would include stellar binary systems with orbital periods longer than about 10 seconds, merging supermassive black holes and maybe GWs from the big bang   This can might include ""event-like"" signals, for example (possibly) a merger of two supermassive black holes that are so large in diameter that even during the merger their orbital frequency is below 1 Hz, but it can also include signals from the rotation of bodies not yet in contact but are slowly losing angular momentum though continuous GW radiation. While these would be much weaker, they would provide a very stable and very narrow peak in a spectrogram with an extremely slow drift, so you could accumulate data for years in order to bring them up out of the noise.  While LIGO's detected events have lasted of the order of 1 second or less, it sounds like it is possible that LISA could potentially record continuous GW radiation from a large number of pairs at the same time since the ""lifetimes"" might be years or millennia rather than seconds, provided that the sensitivity to these weaker signals is sufficient.  Question: What is the expected nature of LISA's data; will it be more like a forest of fairly static or slowly moving peaks in frequency space, or a series of individual events? Presumably this has been modeled based on some predictions of the number of different kinds of pairs at various separations expected to be found nearby. "
3430,"If the Sun got larger, but maintained its luminosity, would the Earth get hotter or colder?","A recent question If the Sun were bigger but colder, Earth would be hotter or colder? asked - if the Sun got bigger and cooler, would the Earth heat up or cool down. I think the answer to that is mainly that it depends on the final luminosity.  However, what I want to know here (hypothetically), is if the Sun got larger and it's effective temperature decreased such that it's luminosity was unchanged; how would that affect the equilibrium temperature of the Earth? I suspect the answer may involve the wavelength dependence of the albedo, emissivity and atmospheric absorption of the Earth.  Another, less hypothetical, way of asking this is, if you put an Earth-like planet at different distances from stars with a variety of temperatures, such that the total flux incident at the top of the atmosphere was identical, how would the temperatures of those planets compare?

3434,"What is the nature of ""rock vapor"" in this description of the formation of the Moon?","The NPR News item MacArthur Fellow And Planetary Scientist Sarah Stewart Discusses How The Moon Was Formed and audio podcast begins:     Ari Shapiro, Host: Sarah Stewart likes to think about what happens when planets collide. She uses two actual cannons to simulate those massive impacts. Here's one firing in her lab at UC Davis.      Unidentified Person:  Firing in three, two, one.           Soundbite of Cannon FIring         Ari Shapiro, Host: Her work earned her a spot in this year's class of MacArthur Fellows. Many of us call it the genius grant. For years, experts have thought that Earth's moon formed after a large collision knocked off a bunch of rock. Stewart told me her research suggests a different story.      Planetary Scientist Sarah Stewart: During planet formation, when two bodies collide, there's so much energy released that most of these bodies are vaporized. That means that a rocky planet like Earth is mostly rock vapor.      Shapiro: What is rock vapor, and what does that have to do with our moon?      Stewart: Rock vapor is taking the rocks that we stand on and heating it up to the point where it becomes a gas. And when that occurs, the Earth becomes much larger because vapor is much less dense. And it extends out into this enormous object hundreds of times larger than the Earth today. And we proposed that our moon grows within the rock vapor of the Earth after a giant impact.      Shapiro: So the moon actually came from the Earth.      Stewart: The moon grows within the rock vapor of the Earth. And that gives the moon the same chemistry as the Earth.   We don't learn about ""rock vapor"" in Earth Science class, but I know it's got to be a lot hotter than the lava we see in the news. A significant fraction of Earth's crust is SiO₂ based and it's boiling point is roughly 3,000°C, and I have a hunch the temperatures involved here are much much higher than that. The kinetic energy associated with say a relative velocity of 40 km/s is roughly 8 eV per AMU, over 130 eV for every oxygen atom for example.  So does ""rock vapor"" start out as a highly ionized ""rock plasma"" with almost no covalent bonds remaining, or does most of the energy of the original impactor get transferred to a much greater mass of Earth?  Is there a good place to read about her and her students' MacArthur grant-getting research described in the podcast? "
3435,Why aren't new stars in Earth's relative proximity constantly discovered?,"Okay, bear with me. In layman's terms:  The estimates vary, but on a clear night, away from big cities, one can see up to 5000 stars in the sky. All those are in the Milky Way, but they're hardly equidistant from Earth, which would mean that they revolve around the galactic center at different orbits. According to some sources, some are positioned very closely to us while others hang out as far as 1000 light year away.  Now by astronomical standards, 5000 stars is not a great number. It's still pretty impressive, though.  Some stars are larger, and others are smaller. It stands to reason that some of them might be ""hiding"" behind others. Because they all orbit the galactic center at different speeds, using different orbits, wouldn't it follow that from time to time, over the centuries, decades, or even years (months?) a ""new"" star would emerge from behind another one? Shouldn't this be happening often; or are they so sparsely distributed around the galaxy that no ""new"" stars have appeared out there over the past three thousand years or so? "

I think the answer is Mars, and a quick google search reveals it is Mars.  I have my reasoning here, but I am not sure if I am correct.  One way to do this problem is to get all the planets and collect their perihelion and aphelion distances from the sun, and see the different.  However I want to be able to explain this without the extensive use of numbers.     Here is my explanation:  The closest planet to us is Mars, both in terms of its aphelion and its perihelion distances  The Earth-Mars distance varies between 2.66 AU and .38 AU  Mercury is almost always blinded by the sun, so we rarely see it in the sky  Venus is frequently viewed as a crescent, and thus its apparent brightness also dimishes  Jupiter and rest of the superior planets are simply too far away for us to notice a big differene    Are all my points correct here?

3446,"How do two supermassive black holes reach ""the last parsec"" in merging galaxies?","This answer to Why can't supermassive black holes merge? (or can they?) describes the barrier to merging that two supermassive black holes face when two galaxies are in the process of merging or have ""successfully"" merged.  Here is a bit of the answer, but its worth taking a moment to go there and read the whole thing:     When two galaxies merge, their supermassive black holes both have angular momentum. Through a phenomenon known as ""dynamical friction,"" gravitational interactions with other stars sap the black holes of much of their angular momentum, until they are brought within a few parsecs or so of each other. At this point, the black holes have flung out all of the stars that were in the region and there is (presumably) nothing left for dynamical friction to sap their angular momentum.    What kind of timescale are we talking about to reach ""the last (few) parsec(s)? Is it similar to the time it takes for the merged galaxy to reach some kind of centralized shape (things rotating around a common center rather than having two identifiable centers of rotation)? Much longer or shorter? What kinds of processes are involved that allow the two black holes to reach the last few parsecs of separation? What is ""dynamical friction"" and ""star-flinging""?  "

3448,How to calculate planetary aspects at a stationary point?,"I am using Jean Meeus book Astronomical Algorithms and the C software that comes with the book to calculate planetary data. I am comparing two planet's longitude to calculate the time when they are a fixed amount of longitude apart such as 45, 60, 90 degrees apart. These are the standard planetary aspects used in astrology.  I can not calculate the correct time when one or both of the planets is approaching its stationary retrograde motion point. At this point the planets velocity approaches zero and the longitude does not have the decimal point accuracy to make a comparison. The time will be off by anywhere from a few minutes to eleven hours when compared to a commercial ephemeris.   Q.) Does anyone know a different method other than simple longitude comparison that can calculate the correct planetary aspect time when planets are near their retrograde motion stationary point?    -- Edit is Below --  Here is an example of my problem. My calculations below are made with Astronomical Algorithms software at 1 minute increments for August 1, 2016 at midnight.

The American Ephemeris at midnight lists the Venus 120(Trine) Uranus as occurring at 4:10 AM. The Astronomical Algorithms calculations below identify Venus 120 Uranus at 3:56AM which is 16 minutes early. Every time a slow outer planet like Uranus is near a station point and moving very slow my aspect time is always off.

3449,Planetary Declination and Axial Tilt,"Is it a coincidence that Earth's axial tilt and maximum declination are both approximately 23 degrees?   Mechanically speaking, do planets physically cross the Solar equator, or is declination due to the axial tilt angle? The later is difficult to visualize given variety of planetary axial tilts i.e Mercury 0, Jupiter 4, Earth and Saturn 23 degrees approximately.   I'll try and give a concise example. At JPL's Horizons you can download data of RA and DEC for all planets and objects placing either Earth or the Sun at the center. This will calculate the Declination of a planet geocentrically or heliocentrically.  The calculations suggest all planets will obtain a maximum declination North and South between 23&deg; and 28&deg; (i.e Mercury reaches 28&deg; when viewed from the Earth). Earth's axial tilt (obliquity) at 23.45&deg; matches its maximum declination N/S.  However, Mercury's Axial tilt is 0&deg; and Jupiter 3.13&deg; so if declination is the angle between the ecliptic plane and the celestial equator how do Mercury and Jupiter obtain maximum declination of 23&deg; and 28&deg; N/S?  I'll appreciate any help clarifying this. "

At this point, Voyager 1 is well beyond the aphelion of all known planets, so according to the definitions above, so at least colloquially, saying that it has left the Solar System seems to make sense. However, according to Wikipedia, it was only officially considered to have left the Solar System once it left the heliopause. This is not really in conflict with the above definitions, as, to my knowledge, the heliopause extends beyond the orbit of all the original 8/9 planets at all times.

The resolution of wavelengths shorter than what the Very Large Telescope Interferometer or the European Extremely Large Telescope detect, in the near UV, suddenly cuts off to a factor of a thousand.  This is obviously because of the properties of Earth's atmosphere. But major space telescopes like the JWST and WFIRST will fill in the far infrared gap. Why aren't there any as ambitious space telescopes planned for UV and shorter wavelengths? (Or is the sudden cut off in that diagram misleading?)  Is it because it is more difficult, even from in-space observatories, or is it because the angular resolution of UV and shorter wavelengths are of lesser scientific value?   "

I imagine that the angle of the path relative to the horizon is approximately the complement of your latitude. "
3463,How do I understand a brown dwarf with a M-type spectrum?,"There are a large fraction of M dwarfs which are claimed to be brown dwarfs.  Why do we still use M-type and not create a new stellar type like L, T and Y? The main signature of M is TiO absorption bands. They appear in M-type brown dwarfs?  Is a spectrum enough to judge whether a celestial object is a brown dwarf or not? Or do we need to know its mass?  The earliest type is M3.5. It means M-type objects older than M3.5 are necessarily brown dwarfs? Or is there a safe value, say, M9, is necessarily a brown dwarf? A brown dwarf is necessarily colder than a red dwarf?   There should be more brown dwarfs or red dwarfs?  The reason we do not need to create a new stellar type is the spectra of brown dwarfs are more like red dwarf's spectra?  "
3464,Apocalypse on earth,What would it feel like on Earth if the Earth accelerated due to sudden changes in the solar system like ejection of another planet? Would there be giant tidal waves and other cataclysmic events? 
3465,Breakthrough Starshot; could we detect similar probes flying by Earth?,"If extraterrestrial civilizations were sending probes by Earth similar to our plans for Breakthrough Starshot (where the probes are only a few meters in diameter and will be moving at up to 0.2c when they fly by the planet), would we be able to detect them, technologically speaking? And if so, what are the odds we would catch a glimpse of one?  EDIT/ADDITION: An additional question I thought of is whether astronauts would potentially be able to perceive such objects with the naked eye, or would the probes be moving far too fast to register?  "
3466,Matter and Antimatter Interaction in the early Universe,"Well it is said that during the Big Bang, things were created in pairs: one matter and one anti-matter. I think its a part of the Big-Bang Theory.  It is also said that matter + anti-matter - Energy  Then shouldn't it be so that there would have been no matter or antimatter in existence now since all of them should have reacted to form pure Energy. I mean how were we created then?  And also where are all the antimatter gone now? Are they still reacting with us?  Thanks "
3467,How do a planet's moons and a planet's rings interact?,"I am making a video game which features a planet and its moon. And I thought I would add rings too.  But that got me wondering... how do a planet's moon and a planet's ring influence each other?  Does a moon clear out all the debris in its orbit? In other words: does it make a gap in the ring? If so, how large is the gap in relation to the moon's radius?  If not, does the moon travel along as all the other matter in the ring? Would it not make the debris fall to the moon, thereby growing the moon?  Lastly, are both the rings and moons typically in the same plane? "
3468,Would a magnetic charge over the Schwinger limit create visual effects in the vacuum of the solar system?,"Say, hypothetically, that you use a variation of the Takeyama electromagnetic coil experiment ([website]Now, suppose you used this same method to create the magnetic field in solar system contained space where there's no atmosphere or localized gas/matter clouds to interact with (but the solar wind/cosmic rays are obviously in play). Would the magnetic field created cause any sort of visible effect (ie; light)?  How about if you created the magnetic field in proximity to something that would be ripped apart by it (ie; a large metal structure like a space ship), or even just solid, not overly magnetic matter (like a person or non-magnetic rock floating in space)? Would that create a visible effect (ie; light)?  I'm curious whether the effect would generate something visible in either of these cases as I'd like to use the effect in a hard-science-based fiction story I'm writing.  "
3469,What would happen if a Sun-like star were to consume a Jupiter-like planet?,"A substantial number of discovered exoplanet systems are likely contain more than one gas giant with distances far closer to the star than in our solar system.  It is known that in solar system evolution gravitational effects between objects can lead to some of them migrating outwards while others migrate inwards.  Has there been any study of what happens when a gas giant approaches its star close enough to start losing mass to it? In this case could the planet end up completely in the star?  For the purposes of this question let's choose a solar-mass G-type star and a gas giant such as Jupiter, since we have so much first-hand knowledge of these objects.  Jupiter has plenty of hydrogen and this would represent the addition of more nucleosynthetic fuel.  Would this be enough to cause the Sun to become the red giant in this case? "
3470,Journal standard for plotting section of skymap?,"I'm a physics graduate student hoping to plot ~10&deg;x10&deg; sections of the sky in right ascension and declination (eventually I will want to plot points on this section at appropriate locations given RA and Dec, preferably in Python). I've seen square plots on the order of arcseconds, where curvature has a small effect, but that won't apply to these larger plots. I'm not familiar with astronomy journals or a module which aids in this sort of plotting.  Is there a commonly accepted method for displaying intermediate-sized sections of a sky-map? How is it implemented? "
3471,"What was the ""optical illusion"" that led to erroneous metal concentrations in stellar atmospheres in the galactic center?","Articles summarizing a recent result about certain heavy element concentrations in stars near the galactic center all say that earlier reports about high levels in stellar atmospheres were the product of an ""optical illusion"". Examples include   UPI.com Study explains optical illusion at the center of the Milky Way Science Daily Mystery at the center of the Milky Way solved Phys.org High levels of scandium near the galaxy's giant black hole were illusory, astronomers find   At least Phys.org goes on to explain with real ""science words"":     According to the new study, the lower temperatures of the giant stars helped to create the optical illusion that appeared in the measurements of spectral lines. Specifically, it means that the electrons in the elements behave differently at different temperatures, which in turn can be misleading when measuring the spectral lines of elements in different stars. The conclusion is the result of a close collaboration between astronomers and atomic physicists. (emphasis added)   Question: What was the ""optical illusion"" that led to erroneous metal concentrations in stellar atmospheres in the galactic center? Beyond just ""electrons in the elements behave differently at different temperatures"" (because how electrons behave in atoms at different temperatures should be at least fairly well understood by astronomers) what specifically is the source of the misunderstanding? Is it atomic physics, incorrect assumption just a mistake, something else?  The mention of ""close collaboration between astronomers and atomic physicists"" suggests that the answer will turn out to be fairly interesting! "
3472,"Advancement of perihelion, data","I was looking for accurate and up-to-date data regarding the advancement of the perihelion of the planets in the Solar System, the only ones I've found so far are at least 90 years old bout I really doubt that no progress has been made so far in this field... does anyone know where to find newer ones?  In addition to this, can anybody make an estimation about the difference between the Moon-Earth system precession around the Sun and a Moonless Earth system? It should be very small, too small to be detected maybe...  Thank you in advance! "
3473,Is Mars expected to go through the tail of Comet Siding?,"This question will likely be answered ""in retrospect"" in about 8 days.  So it's a great opportunity to ""lay it out there"" and then let reality prove you right/wrong.  On the 19th of October, Comet Siding is expected to pass Mars very closely (1/3 the distance of the moon from Earth). My assumption is that this means its nucleus.  But comet tails can be very long (100s of millions of miles).  For the sake of this questions let's keep it to ""obviously observable"" tail and coma.    Additionally ""going through"" may need a definition.  So let's say that if a line drawn from the outer (obviously observable) coma closest to Mars and the end of the (obviously observable) tail were to intersect with-in 20 miles of the surface of Mars, then we would say that Mars has ""gone through the tail"" of the comet.  So is Mars expected (or even more fun, do YOU expect Mars) to go through the tail of Comet Siding on the 19th of October?  If so, what will be observable from the surface of Mars? Large number of shooting stars?    NASA is preparing to hide its satellites (repositioning them to the ""far side"" of Mars)  from comet dust traveling at 35 miles/sec.    Is there any idea of how long the encounter will last?  "
3474,Filters for solar eclipse and solar feature viewing,"I have    a Vixen ED100SF ED refracting telescope and  10x50 6.5 Bushnell Legend Porro Prism binoculars   and would like to outfit both with filters for solar eclipse viewing. I gather the basic setup simply involves finding an appropriate filter, that fits the equipment, but I'm new to this and the range of options is bewildering. Ideally I'd also like something that allows me to see solar features, but I gather that these can be quite expensive.  What are my options (or a good reference on options) for viewing solar eclipses and solar features? Would something like an ""eyepiece"" filter work on its own for safe viewing, or would my telescope require something different? "
3475,How big would the asteroid belt planet be?,"As I understand it, the asteroid belt exists because the gravitational force of Jupiter prevents the asteroids from accreting (is that a word?) into a planet.  If, however, Jupiter didn't exist and they did create a planet, how big would that planet be? "
3476,What would be the scientific impact of locating the Thirty Meter Telescope at its alternate site?,"The NPR.org article Hawaii Protesters Block Access Road To Stop Construction Of Massive Telescope briefly summarizes the situation, one paragraph says:     The TMT, as it is called, has been the object of intense opposition for nearly a decade and the building project has faced numerous delays, protests and lawsuits. But a decision by the state's Supreme Court in October cleared the way for construction to begin after reinstating a building permit that was revoked years earlier. And last week, Gov. David Ige announced several roads would be closed beginning Monday to allow for the movement of large equipment onto the mountain.   and another says     ""Hawaii is a unique place,"" Meisenzahl said, noting that protesters gathered on the mountain were engaging in a peaceful, nonviolent form of protest called Kapu Aloha. ""It's a small island and everybody knows each other so law enforcement and opponents are working together. Despite what is happening today it's a positive environment,"" he added.    Question: What would be the scientific impact of locating the Thirty Meter Telescope at its alternate site? Is it a loss of resolution, or infrared spectrum, or both, or something else?  I think the Canary Island site would be the alternate to Mauna Kea, since the E-ELT would be located in Chile and putting both (extremely) large telescopes in the same hemisphere is undesirable.  "
3477,Why does iron consume more energy in the fusion process than it produces?,"I understand that once a star starts fusing iron, it's doomed to collapse because iron fusion requires more energy than it releases in the process, allowing the opposing gravity of the star to cause it to collapse.  But why?  What makes iron special in this way?  It seems to occupy a pretty inconsequential spot in the middle of the period table among the transition metals.  So, why is it that iron breaks the rule in play for all the elements before it when it comes to fusion?  I noticed that on another question someone said that it wasn't iron, but nickel that was the first element that required more energy to fuse than it released- but every documentary and book I've read claims that it's iron.  So, if you're answer is ""iron isn't the first element that requires more energy..."" please explain why every other source I've ever heard is wrong! "
3478,The specifics of two Earth-like worlds orbiting each other?,"I'm currently looking into writing a story or two set on twin worlds, which I came to find out in my research is apparently not a new idea (Double planets?   Rocheworlds?  Am I close?).  But I want it to be as scientifically plausible as possible, so I'm here fact-checking.  I guess my main question going forward is: is the description of my worlds, as they are, scientifically plausible, and if not, what should I change?  Specifically, these two worlds are very similar to our own Earth.  To simplify things, let's say they have the exact same or relatively similar atmosphere and living conditions, so that humans and Earth-based life can live on it without much or noticeable acclimation.  If you were to hop a ship from Earth and landed on one or the other, getting off the ship you would notice little to no difference than you would on Earth.  Similarly, the short trip between each world shows little to no difference, although one has slightly more gravity than the other.  The only real difference between the two worlds themselves is that one is slightly smaller than the other, but by an almost negligible amount (a few thousand miles); the difference isn't as dramatic as, say, Earth and Mars orbiting each other, maybe Earth and Venus being the better comparison. Let's also suppose that they are also far enough away from one another that they aren't dramatically effecting one another's gravity or tides, etc., but are still visible in one another's skies, prominent enough to be important to the culture of the other.  I initially wanted them to be very prominent in one another's skies, but I suppose being as close as the moon is to our world would be too close: I'm curious as to how far away one would have to be and still be caught in the other's gravity (I suppose the smaller of the two would have to be the one caught in the bigger one's gravity?  I plead ignorance on that one).    I'm in love with the idea that they broke off from one another in the same way the Earth and the moon supposedly did billions of years ago, in an impact event, and they slowly came to orbit one another (although this idea has recently been challenged, is my understanding).  From what I've read, though, it might be more plausible that one formed naturally in the disk formation of that planet's solar system, and a rogue planet got caught in its gravitational pull.  I like that idea less, but I'm not so proud I can't just get over it.  In my head, they have their own day and night cycles, just like Earth.  They may not have identical hours in a day or days in a year, etc., but its similar.  They same face of the planet is never quite facing the face of the other: it's not like the moon, which is locked to one side always facing us and the other always away.  From what I've researched, though, it's probably more likely that the planets would be facing one another on one side constantly, and their day-night systems would be greatly affected by that.  Again, not in love with that idea, but if it has to go, it has to go.  That's all I have for now.  I would try to explain how they rotate one another better, but I can't: I'm terrible in that area, and I've forgotten a lot of the terms you use in describing this.  Please let me know what your thoughts are. "
3479,Composition and Proton Flux from the Solar Wind,"I am taking a class on the space environment and I have a few questions about the solar wind.  A number of sources list the composition as (approximately) 4% He[tex] and 96% H[tex].  What exactly does this mean?  Does it mean by mass or by number of ions?  Also, when discussing proton flux due to the solar wind at Earth:  What exactly is included in the flux numbers quoted (e.g., one source I have says 2e12 m[tex]s[tex]).  Is that the flux due to only the H[tex] and excluding the He[tex] and other minor constituents?  Or, are they including all the protons from the other ions as well? "
3480,Telescope focal point and inversion,"When looking at a diagram of the optical path through a newtonian reflector, the lines always cross before the eyepiece. I understand that the eyepiece is used to focus this diverging light cone so that your eye can observe an image.   If you use a camera in ""prime focus"" i.e. Without an eyepiece to rectify this diverging light cone, it can discern an image anyway? Would this mean that the focus adjustment (distance from the focal point) merely determines the size of the image on the sensor? Or is there still a point where the image is in focus?   How do we ensure that this occurs while the light cone is still smaller than the sensor? Or is the whole image always varied in focus across the cone, just that the depth of field allows all of it to be in focus enough for a good image? "
3481,Array of telescopes with single orbiting collector?,"Might such a thing give better images than we could get from other virtual telescopes with multiple collectors? Or is having multiple collectors not a limiting factor? Could a single collector compensate for atmospheric distortion in a way multiple collectors cannot?  We sometimes use arrays of radio telescopes spread over a wide distance to increase the effective aperture. I think that array is called a virtual telescope, but I might be wrong. A normal radio telescope has a collector in the same way that a satellite dish has a collector. The reflector of a radio telescope is parabolic so as to focus parallel waves to a single point. That works because dish and collector are in a fixed geometry. The reflectors of my imagined telescope would need to turn so that they reflected waves from whichever part of the sky was being observed onto the collector. That turning would change the required curvature for perfect parabolic-ness.   The telescope I'm imaging would have a (perhaps geostationary) satellite as the collector and an array of flat-ish reflectors spread over hundreds of kilometers working together to collect waves from the same part of the sky. Being non-parabolic, the reflectors wouldn't be very efficient, but they could compensate by being numerous.  The collector wouldn't have to be geostationary, because the reflectors already need to compensate for the earth turning; adding the satellite's movement into the equation wouldn't be terribly complicated.   "
3482,What are the odds for any two bodies to collide during the milky way-Andromeda collision?,"When the two main galaxies of the local group will collide, it is very unlikely for stars to collide with another, but how unlikely is it in the initial collision? And over the whole merging process? "
3483,What part of the milky way do we see from earth?,"When looking up at the night sky, we can sometimes observe a bright band of stars stretching across it. I know this is our galaxy but exactly what are we looking at?    Could we look at the centre of the galaxy or is there another spiral arm blocking our view? How does our view change as earth rotates around the sun? (E.g. What part of the milky way do we see in a winter night sky)  "
3484,What happens if two galaxies collide very quickly?,"What would happen if two galaxies collided very quickly (e.g. at near the speed of light)?  Would they mostly just pass through eachother unscathed, or would there be very energetic collisions that would rip both galaxies apart, or would something else happen? "
3485,Should this photo of the sun's surface actually be white?,"If I'm told correctly (eg. What Color is the Sun?) that the sun is actually white, should the photo on that page actually be white too? Is it just doctored to meet peoples expectations?:    Likewise for all the red photo's in a Google image search for ""The Sun's surface"". "
3486,How much radiation would something need to output to sufficiently affect the CMB?,"Let’s say that I had some device capable of outputting insane amounts of radiation, across the entire EM spectrum. If I wanted to affect the CMB to the point that, were Earth-based scientists to know that the device existed, they would be unable to gather any useful data from the CMB regarding the early universe, how much radiation would this theoretical device have to output? Peaking in what frequency? Where would be the optimal place to put it? Or multiple copies of it?  If someone who actually knows stuff about the CMB is scratching their head thinking I’m nuts, I probably am. I don’t know much about the CMB, except that it’s random EM waves that are leftovers from the Big Bang, peaking in the microwave frequency range. So if what I’m describing is absolutely implausible across all frequencies and amplitudes, I would appreciate if you could explain why, given my low level of knowledge on the topic.   In the event that for certain waves what I’m describing is possible, I would be curious to know if there’s actually anything in the known universe that could do it. "
3487,What is the main source of opacity in sunspots?,"In the first version of my answer to Are sunspots vertically displaced from the surrounding photospheric plasma?, I naively used Kramer's law to attempt to show an inverse relationship between opacity [tex] and temperature [tex] due to bound-free or free-free absorption in a region with density [tex]: [tex] Rob Jeffries pointed out that this might not be accurate in the photosphere, even though it works well deeper inside most stars (though for high-mass stars, Thomson scattering dominates and [tex] is approximately constant). After some more reading, I concluded that this was right. At lower temperatures, interactions with ionized hydrogen mean that [tex] is the major contributor to opacity, and it follows a law [tex] I believe the transition of dominance happens around [tex], meaning that [tex] opacity should be the major contribution in the stellar photosphere.  At even lower temperatures, however ([tex]), molecular scattering can be important (see Tennyson et al. (2007)). While this is not necessarily important at all points in the stellar photosphere, I think that it should be important in sunspots, which can have temperatures in this range.  What is/are the major source(s) of opacity in sunspots? Does molecular scattering dominate, or is [tex] still important? If both are important, to varying degrees, how can the mean opacity be calculated?  My knowledge of stellar atmospheres and atmospheric models is limited, so I apologize if this comes down to being a basic question. "
3488,How to leave the Universe,"If the Universe is flat and expanding at the speed of light, that must mean that we could never leave it, because one would have to travel faster than the speed of light which is not possible. However, what about going straight up or down ? The distance is less and if the Universe is not expanding in depth but only sideways then it would be possible to exit. Could we then find another Universe once we have gone out of this one ? "
3489,Is having a surname which begins with the letter “A” a big advantage for a researcher in astronomy/astrophysics? Is changing our surname a good idea?,"Is having a surname which begins with the letter “A” a big advantage for a researcher in astronomy/astrophysics?  If I have a surname which begins with the letter “M”, and I haven’t published any paper yet, would changing my surname to a name which begins with the letter “A” be a good idea? Or would the advantage gained be too small to make it worth the effort?  Approximately what percentages of research papers in astronomy/astrophysics order their authors …   purely alphabetically? half by contribution and half alphabetically? purely by contribution?  "
3490,length of Star lifetime,"In a star, the fact that not all the hydrogen is used up, not all the helium is used up etc. is a little counterintuitive.  Shouldn't it be that a star looses the hydrogen layer passively, in other words all the hydrogen eventually fuses into helium forming a helium star which then fuses all its helium into carbon forming a carbon star etc. all the way to iron? In this way you get up to the temperature required to form iron and nickel in stars with a much lower mass and in massive stars you might even have Iron being fused to form heavier metals.  Why isn't this so? "
3491,Declination of the Sun formula,I encountered a book discussion that defines the Sun's declination as 23.5 degrees (inclination of Earth's equator to the ecliptic) times the sine of the Sun's longitude. Does this make sense? How do i visualize it?

3493,Do all galaxies have a black hole in the center?,"Would I be correct if I stated that all galaxies have a black hole in the center? Since other galaxies orbit around a center point in a galaxy - the barycenter, right? - I would assume at this point there must be some insane gravitational pull. Which only black holes can create, right?   (If this is a bit vague, please tell me so I can clarify!) I am a complete newbie to astronomy in general, so sorry if this question makes no sense whatsoever. "
3494,Is there any way for a planet orbiting a red dwarf in the habitable zone to not be tidally locked?,"Is there any way to avoid the tidal locking of a planet orbiting a red dwarf in the habitable zone?  For example, could a planet with a 90° obliquity and large moon avoid such a situation? "
3495,Is there a lower limit for the altitude of orbiting objects?,"As I understand it, one object can orbit another at a variety of altitudes, and the stability of the orbit is determined by (among other things) the speed of the orbiting object.  Go too slowly and you'll fall into the larger object, go too quickly and you'll fly off into space, but go at just the right speed and you'll orbit indefinitely.  And while an object could be in a stable orbit at Altitude X by going Speed A, it could also be in an equally stable orbit at Altitude Y by going Speed B.  If that's true (and given my limited understanding, feel free to say it simply isn't), is there a lower limit?  An atmosphere would obviously cause drag, but given a lack of atmosphere, could you theoretically have an asteroid stably orbiting an Earth-sized planet at an altitude of 50 feet, if it were going fast enough?  If not, why not?  What forces limit the closeness of an orbiting object?  Also, simple explanations would be most appreciated: I've heard of things like Lagrange points and such, but I don't have a good understanding of them. "
3496,What complementary observation campaigns have looked at Kepler's field of view?,"It seems to be common practice to double up observations. For example, shortly before New Horizons flew by Pluto, several of its moons were discovered by telescopes as a concerted effort was put in because of the occasion.  Have other telescopes made systematic and dedicated observations of the field of view of the Kepler telescope? I imagine speculatively in this paragraph that such observations could've been part of a survey process to determine where to point Kepler out of a set of candidate FOVs to begin with. And once decided upon, that field more closely examined. Then during the Kepler mission persistently observed in order to help rule out noise from passing asteroids and binary and variable stars and to gather complementary data. To characterize transiting planets, it is important to characterize the stars they are orbiting, something which telescopes with other kinds of instruments can be helpful with. Those are just my speculations about why I would think that Kepler's primary mission was ""doubled up"" by other kinds of telescopes.  What are some of the preparatory, complementary or follow up observation campaigns that have been made of the Kepler field of view? Is Kepler's FOV now one of the most and best observed parts of the sky? "
3497,"What does it mean that the Sun`s rotation axis is: RA 286.13° , Dekl: 63.87°?","first post here.  I found 1 related Question, which has not solved my Problem.

Please refer some good resources for further study in this topic. "
3499,Do black holes have energy?,"So black holes are created by certain dying stars and when the star runs out of nuclear energy gravity wins out and the star implodes. An entire star’s mass collapses down into a smaller and smaller volume of space. Which then creates a black hole, so my question is, do black holes actually have energy to create that type of vacuum to suck light in?  If a black hole was created by a huge star running out of fuel and then collapsing in on it self, would the black hole have energy and if so where would it come from, or is it just like the vacuum in space with no energy at all?  (Please correct me if I said anything wrong about the black holes as I am very young and don't quiet grasp the concept of it yet.) "
3500,How can the next supermoon be analytically predicted?,"The lunar motion can be predicted with basic celestial mechanics, but the perigee and apogee are not always the same, basically because the attraction of the Sun makes some oscilations in the semi-axis of the orbit ([website]My question is: how do they know when the full moon will get as close as it got in the recent supermoon? For example, the Dailypost article Biggest Supermoon in 68 years will light up the November sky claims that the full moon won't come this close to Earth until November 25th, 2034. How do they kow that? Are they using the perturbation theory equations to predict this? If so, can anybody give me some source or explanation of how it's done analytically? "
3501,How would we detect a planet behind the Sun?,"Let's assume hypothetically that Earth has a twin planet on the opposite side of Earth's orbit. Its orbital period would be exactly the same as Earth's and it would always be behind the Sun so directly observing it from Earth would not be possible.  How would we detect the planet's existence short of sending out a spacecraft that could look ""behind"" the sun and observe it visually? Have we confirmed that there is no such planet? "
3502,What causes the dimensions of a star increase when its hydrogen fuel is exhausted?,"What causes the dimensions of a star increase when its hydrogen fuel is exhausted? For example, the Sun is expected to increase its radius 250 times. What causes this if its temperature is expected to fall? How gas can expand if the temperature falls? "
3503,Time period in which a planet rotates,"I notice that Wikipedia give two contradictory terms for the time period in which a planet rotates in relation to an infinitely-distant object. In one place this is called a ""sidereal day"" and in another ""stellar day"". Which of these are correct? For that point, is this an IAU definition? I cannot find the definitions on the IAU website.  From the Sidereal Day page:     A sidereal day is the length of time it takes a planet to rotate from the perspective of a distant star.   From the Day page:        stellar day - an entire rotation of a planet with respect to the distant stars   sidereal day - a single rotation of a planet with respect to the vernal equinox     "
3504,Could dark matter be considered a medium?,"Long ago, it was theorized that light had to travel through a medium, until the particle/wave duality of light was discovered.  Then it changed to the idea that light can travel through the vacuum of space as a particle.    Light travels at different speeds depending on the medium that the light is traveling through.  It travels slower in water than it does through air.    However, is there any possibility that dark matter is a medium that light travels through?  Could it be conceivable that what we recognize as light speed is really just the speed at which light travels through this medium?  If we were to remove dark matter, would light go faster? "
3505,"Is this object an asteroid or comet, and how can it produce so many tails?","The NASA Hubble Space Telescope Science Release HEIC 1320 - When is a Comet not a Comet? - Hubble astronomers observe bizarre six-tailed asteroid is self-explanatory, but it doesn't explain what actually happening.  Sometimes comets will show two tails, but one is usually identified with the path of the comet's orbit, and the other with the direction away from the sun. But this is an asteroid (or so it seems) and there are many tails with complex behavior.  edit: I've found this ArXiv preprint: The Extraordinary Multi-Tailed Main-Belt Comet P/2013 P5 where ""main belt"" refers to the main belt of asteroids, and yet the object is now called a comet.  Wikipedia lists both names and suggests both designations - asteroid or comet:     311P/PANSTARRS also known as P/2013 P5 (PANSTARRS) is an asteroid (or main-belt comet) discovered by the Pan-STARRS telescope on 27 August 2013.(4) Observations made by the Hubble Space Telescope revealed that it had six comet-like tails.(5) The tails are suspected to be streams of material ejected by the asteroid as a result of a rubble pile asteroid spinning fast enough to remove material from it.(2)   It's been three point five years now - has this been figured out yet? Is it an asteroid or comet (or both), and how can it produce so many tails?   above: HST image of comet P/2013 P5 from here.   above: HST image (annotated) of comet P/2013 P5 from here. "
3506,Question about space-time,"In the Big Bang model of the Universe, every observable thing is thought to have expanded very abruptly from a point of infinite density and zero volume. However, the problem with this assertion is that for something to expand it first needs a locality in which to do such, which brings us to my question. How can scientists believe that ""everything"" was condensed and then suddenly expanded, since such is automatically an oxymoron?  Expansion is a physical property of the universe and yet if ""everything"" had no where to expand, how could it have expanded? There was ""nothing,"" was there not? Even if we drop the big bang model and talk about ""everything's"" being in a singularity point, the question still stands.  Where was the singularity point? Asked differently, into what is everything expanding (which is a rhetorical question I ask to implicate space-time as necessarily existing irrespective of any theoretical expansion and likely so vastly that one might as well assume that space-time is infinitely large).     As well, it seems counter-intuitive, as little impressive a word as that is given its context here, that something like... well, ""everything"" could be condensed in the first place, let alone infinitely condensed and with zero volume. When thinking about the big-bang model, I can't help but conclude that a mere analogy was originally used for stellar birth, evolution and finally explosion. The issue though is still extension.  As far as I understood it, the big bang model states that space itself was also condensed along with everything else in the observable universe to a point of singularity. So, if that's the case, then [where] was the singularity point?  It ends up becoming an infinite regress, of course. Or, if you don't like the issue of ""time"" presupposed by my question, then look at the question after the universe started expanding. All the matter had to expand somewhere and ""somewhere"" is not ""nothing."" - It just seems that the model is somehow overlooking said feature of the actual universe and trying to account for it by mere assertion.  If you want to call it space-time, extension, space, where everything supposedly expanded to and is and is still expanding to, then that's my question. How does the theory allege where everything is yet at the same time assert that prior to the singularity point, there was literally nothing. "
3507,why do we look at dark energy as an energy?,"We call dark matter dark matter, because of the way it acts on galaxies, but why do we look at dark energy as an energy? With [tex], can't dark energy be mass as well? Why dont we look at dark energy as a mass, in the same way as we look at dark matter as being a missing mass (as halo around galaxies)?  "
3508,"When I read that a system is located x light years away, why is there no direction?","Well, I just read an article about a galaxy with two black holes, and it stated that the galaxy is 1 billion light-years away. Why is there no direction given? If the Big Bang happened, and things are moving away from each other, we can still have at least two directions - away from the center, and to it. Is that a right way to think about space and our drift in space? "

3512,How is the mass and semimajor axis of a directly imaged exoplanet found?,I can't find information on this for the life of me.   How do astronomers approximate the mass and semimajor axis of a directly imaged exoplanet? Would several photos need to be taken to find the period and find with Kepler's third law or can it be inferred through the temperature of the planet (or another method)? Also if you have any sources of this that would be great.   Thanks 
3513,"Have we ever observed a body, such as a large asteroid, ""hitting"" the Sun?",Some other SE questions about launching ICBM's into the sun got me wondering whether we have ever observed an object on a path that intersected with the Sun? How close did it get?  
3514,Do great spot like features favour appear in south hemisphere?,"As we know, both Jupiter and Neptune have great spot like features in South hemisphere, and Saturn has dragon storm in south hemisphere, is it true that great spot like features appear in South hemisphere more frequently? If so, what is the reason? "
3515,Is it possible that only one hemisphere of a planet has an atmosphere?,"Suppose there is a tidally locked planet orbiting a star. The planet's surface consists of a global ocean, that is, liquid water. At the inner hemisphere the temperature is so high that the water is constantly boiling, creating the atmosphere of water vapor. But the vapor does not reach the dark side of the planet, and precipitates around the terminator line. The further side has no atmosphere and an icy surface.  Is this setup possible? Can it be such thing that one side of a planet has liquid (and boiling) water surface while the other side has no atmosphere?  Is it possible at all that a part of an ocean was boiling while the other one was icy? "
3516,How is a Galaxy formed?,"How is a galaxy formed? I know that the center of our galaxy is considered to be Sagittarius A* and it's surrounded by a lot of stars (also a lot of neutron stars).  But what makes this happen? I mean, why are all those stars in that right formation, like other galaxies, rather than just being random clouds of stars in the universe? "
3517,Could we parallax measure stars just based on the Earth's size?,"Imagine two major surface observatories, perhaps the ""northermost"" and ""southernmost"" such (ideally on a similar longitude).  For nearby stars, could they each take a photo at the same time, and achieve a distance measurement to that star, based on about the size of the Earth as the baseline?  (I appreciate that either of the scopes need only wait a few days, for their viewpoint to have moved a much longer baseline distance!)  Or is that distance far too short?  What then is about the minimum baseline we could parallax-measure the nearest stars, with our currently best telescopes?  100,000km, a million? Far more? "
3518,"What day/night cycles, climate and seasons would experience Alpha Centauri Bb inhabitants?","Alpha Centauri Bb is an exoplanet orbiting Alpha Centauri B. It is asserted that given the close distance to the star the planet should be tidally locked.   The orbiting period of the planet is about 3.2 days.  If the planet has no atmosphere (which is very possible due to proximity to the star), its dark side should experience low temperatures like permanently-shadowed areas of Mercury do.  At the same time the planet is about 11 AU from the other star, Alpha Centauri A.  This possibly means that the planet should experience quasi-day/night cycle each 3.2 days.  My questions are:   To what temperatures the dark surface of such planet could be heated? Is there possibility of liquid water? Will the radiation of the second star be enough to provide normal day-like illumination and heating? Will the calendar on such a planet differ sufficiently from a calendar of a planet that experiences day/night cycles from the nearest star? Will such planet experience seasons and how they would be arranged?  "
3519,Why don't we have in-between planets?,"The planets in our system are most often grouped into two categories:    Terrestrial:   Mercury Venus Earth Mars   Gas Giants:   Jupiter Saturn Uranus Neptune   Why is it that we don't see ""in-between"" planets in our system - large, rocky worlds larger than Earth but with thick atmospheres somewhat similar to those of gas giants? Are they possible? Did they not occur by random chance? "
3520,What is the correct ratio of Newtonian to General Relativistic gravitational effects for Sun + single planet orbital system,"For a hypothetical orbital system (Sun + single planet) the Newtonian model and the General Relativity (GR) model produce different expressions for the gravitational effect of the Sun on the planet. This is well known.  The ratio between the Newtonian and GR effects is expressed in different ways by different writers.  I am having trouble reconciling two such expressions of the Newtonian:GR ratio.  Firstly Walter (2008) (equation 12.7.6, page 482) presents  the following expression for the equation of motion produced from the GR model  [tex] where [tex], [tex], [tex] is the universal constant of gravitation, [tex] is mass of the Sun, [tex] is speed of light.  Here the term [tex] is the ordinary Newtonian term and the term [tex] is the additional term introduced by GR. From this Walter derives the approximate ratio between Newtonian and GR effects as [tex] to [tex] where [tex] is the orbital speed of the planet in a circular orbit (with distance [tex] = [tex], the semi-major axis).  Secondly, an alternative presentation (referring to the so-called Schwartzchild solution) is given by Goldstein in Classical Mechanics (3rd Edition) pages 536-538.  The GR potential [tex] is given by [tex] where [tex] is the target body mass and [tex] is a constant (Goldstein uses [tex] instead of [tex], see below, but I have already used [tex] to mean something different in Walter above,)  differentiating the potential with respect to distance [tex] to give force we derive [tex] Now Goldstein defines the constant [tex] thus :- $$ b = \frac{k\,l^2}{m^2c^2} \qquad\text{ Goldstein eqtn [12.48]}  $$ where $$ k=GMm  $$ and  $$ l^2 = mka(1-e^2) \qquad\text{ Goldstein eqtn[12.50]} $$  So  $$b = \frac{GMm\, m\, GMm\, a(1-e^2)}{m^2c^2} = \frac{GMm \, L^2}{c^2} = \frac{GMm \,m^2 v_c^2 a^2}{c^2} $$  So the GR force equation becomes $$ F_{GR} = \frac{GMm}{r^2} + \frac{3GMm m^2 v_c^2 a^2}{r^4c^2} $$ substituting [tex] by [tex] we get $$ F_{GR} = \frac{GMm}{r^2} + \frac{3GMm m^2 v_c^2}{r^2c^2} = \frac{GMm}{r^2} \left( 1 + \frac{3 v_c^2 \, m^2}{c^2} \right) $$  So the Newtonian:GR ratio derived from Goldstein is the same as the ratio derived by Walter except that the former has the additional term of [tex] in the numerator. Even if we tried to fudge this numerically by invoking a unit mass target, it would still be dimensionally incorrect.  So what is the correct ratio? [tex] UPDATE --------------------------------------------------------------------- In the refactoring of [tex] I used angular momentum [tex] when I should have used specific angular momentum [tex]. After correction the extra [tex] disappears. Goldstein agrees with Walter. My thanks to Stan Liou for illumination. Corrected analysis:- $$b = \frac{GMm\, m\, GMm\, a(1-e^2)}{m^2c^2} = \frac{GMm \, \mathfrak{l}^2}{c^2} = \frac{GMm \,v_c^2 a^2}{c^2} $$  So the GR force equation becomes $$ F_{GR} = \frac{GMm}{r^2} + \frac{3GMm v_c^2 a^2}{r^4c^2} $$ substituting [tex] by [tex] we get $$ F_{GR} = \frac{GMm}{r^2} + \frac{3GMm v_c^2}{r^2c^2} = \frac{GMm}{r^2} \left( 1 + \frac{3 v_c^2}{c^2} \right) $$  So the correct ratio of Newtonian to GR gravitational force is:- $$ F_{Newtonian}:F_{GR} \approx  1: \left( 1 + \frac{3 v_c^2}{c^2} \right) $$  NOTES  This ratio is approximate and only applies in the ""low velocity, weak field"" sub-domain of the GR model.    Goldstein also emphasises that the GR effect is not a velocity effect (presumably as in the velocity of the target body through any kind of aether or flux).  Coincidentally (in the same sub-domain e.g. Mercury orbitting the Sun) a modified Newtonian radial force of magnitude [tex], where [tex] is the instantaneous transverse velocity of a small target planet, produces non-Newtonian apsidal rotation (""perihelion precession"") of the same magnitude (within 1%) as GR.    Goldstein needs to be read with care. Here he uses [tex] to denote angular momentum elsewhere (e.g. eqtn [1.7]) he uses [tex]. He often refers to [tex] as ""potential"" when he is clearly referring to ""potential energy"" (e.g. eqtn [3.49]). "

3522,does a minority of all planetary systems show transits?,do most or only a minority of all planetary systems to show transits?

Could someone explain which answer is correct because now I am confused? 
3523,Where does Jupiter's gravitational force come from? Why don't Jupiters gasses fly away?,"Gravitational force is the attractive force between any two masses.  What about gaseous planets, where do they get their attractive force from?  While the big rocky planets don't have enough attractive force to keep enough gases in their gravitational field, Jupiter has lots of gases.  Does this means there is a concentrated mass inside, under which gravitational field the gases are kept 'in'? And if so, then why are gaseous planets not also considered to be rocky ones? "
3524,Planets and Pluto? Neptune?,"If one of the rules to be a planet is that it needs to clear ALL objects from their orbit, does this also make Neptune a non-planet? Since it has thus far failed to clear Pluto (and based on an answer from the physics board, the kuiper belt) from it's orbit. Or does this rule not really apply to planets and we should welcome Pluto and a few other dwarf-planets into our family of planets?  "
3525,Buying a telescope for the first time. How important is the focal ratio and is a computerised telescope worth it?,"I'm wanting to purchase a telescope for the first time. I've narrowed it down to 2 options based on what I've discovered from researching and my price range. I mainly want do planetary observations and some deep space. The 2 options that I've found are the following   Celestron 114 LCM Computerized Telescope Orion 9851 SpaceProbe 130 EQ Reflector Telescope   From what I've gathered, both do have decent specs for what I want to do but I'm still a bit lost when it comes to the aperture and focal length. The Celestron 114LCM has a 1000mm focal length but the aperture is only 114mm where the Orion 130 has a 900mm focal length but a 130mm aperture. Am I right in thinking that the Orion telescope would be better for me? Also, with the Celestron telescope it is computerised so, although the fun would be taken out of messing around with the scope and feeling satisfied with the results, is it really worth it to have this feature for a first time purchase? Thanks in advance! "
3526,Does cosmological horizon grow or decrease as it radiates?,"Black holes decrease as they evaporate and their radius decreases as well.  So what is with a cosmological horizon?  If cosmological horizon is just a black hole centered at the opposite side of the universe, we should see the radius of the external space groving as the radius of the BH decreases.  But if the radiation decreases the horizon entropy we should see the area of the horizon decreasing.  What is the correct conclusion? "
3527,Frequency of transit in planar and non-planar planetary systems,"Supposing that another planetary system is in one plane like our solar system, if let's say that the transit of one planet is visible then is it safe to also assume that all planets in the system must transit?  Logically I feel like that this makes sense because since they are all in the same plane then they therefore must all transit as well. But then I feel like the transit probability equation could make this false? Could someone please clarify my doubts?  Also suppose that we are in another system where each planet doesn't necessarily orbit in the same plane.  Is it easier to find transits if the planets are orbiting in the same or random planes?  I think that you have a better chance detecting a planet if they are in random orbits. but i am a bit lost in regards to detecting multiple transits. "
3528,Is there a theoretical limit on telescope's resolution?,"Is there a theoretical limit on what we can see with a telescope of fixed size based on Earth's orbit or the Moon, that is in Earth's region of Solar system outside the Earth's atmosphere?  Why not instead of sending probes to Pluto and Ceres, just invest efforts into building better telescopes, so to photograph the surfaces of these bodies in greater detail? I suspect that all necessary information in fact reacheds Earth's region, it is just matter of sensibility and exposure to fix it, am I right? "

3532,Is early life required for life?,"I was watching the new Cosmos and Neil DeGrasse Tyson said something that made me go hmmm...  He mentioned that the only reason that the Earth did not experience the runaway greenhouse effect like Venus is that life had evolved to the point at which it could feed on carbon and take it out of the atmosphere and deposit it in solid form as limestone.  The question is, if we were to find a planet in the Goldilocks zone, how likely is it that it would be habitable for life without already harboring life?  Would we expect that a similar scenario would have had to taken place on that planet to curb the greenhouse gasses in the atmosphere, thereby turning it into another Venus?  Can a carbon cycle exist without life? "

3534,"Is Pluto a ""proto-planet""?","My question is this : could the Charon-Pluto system becomes in the coming few millions years a full fledged planet, as in the IAU classification ?  I ask this because there are two facts that bother me :    The system orbit isn't on the ecliptic The system hasn't cleared its neighborhood   So, is it possible that that system isn't stabilized yet, and that 1) its orbit is very slowly changing (for lack of a better word) to the ecliptic, and 2) that the system will slowly collapse, and bring all its moons with it, to clear its neighborhood ?  In other words, is Pluto a ""proto-planet"" (as I would personally name it), or definitely (and for the next millions years) a dwarf planet ?  Edit : I disagree on the fact that this question is a duplicate of How long will it take Pluto to grow to planet size? as this one ask not for the size of Pluto, but rather the other characteristics, the orbit and the clearing the neighborhood. Moreover, the question was asked in a broader canvas, to know if it was possible that some elements of the solar system (Pluto, but not only) could be instable enough to reach the level of planet sometime in the futur.

3535,Are there clouds/clusters of gas in space that have red and blue color adjescent to one another?,"In artistic renditions of space scenes, there were stunning depictions of gasses or galaxies with bold red and blue colors immediately adjacent to one another, in contact as water is with oil in a container. I wonder, are there known arrangements of gas like that, with both ends of the color spectrum adjacent to one another? If so, what are some examples, what is known about them, and what causes the two colors?  One reason I'd call it into question is that I'd imagine the properties of boldly blue gasses are different than those of red gasses. Maybe that assumption is wrong because the property of color isn't necessarily associated with other properties. Another assumption would be that gasses with very different properties wouldn't find themselves collecting adjacent to one another in space. That assumption could also be wrong - I'm not an astronomer and only have basic understanding of physics and chemistry. "

All the galaxies are the source of our knowledge of the big bang.       Everything we know about the history of the universe comes to us from these galaxies.

According to the linked article:     Tombaugh was born on Feb. 4, 1906, in Streator, Ill. He might have been a typical farm boy but for his one fascination: astronomy. Through the influence of his father and an uncle, the 12-year-old Tombaugh began observing the night sky. He spent hundreds of hours using a 9-inch telescope bought at Sears and Roebuck, learning to methodically identify stars and constellations as well as to observe the movements of the planets.   But on page 243 of Gary Leonard Cameron Iowa State University 2010 thesis Public skies: telescopes and the popularization of astronomy in the twentieth century it says:     Sears Roebuck had only a few cheap hand-held telescopes for sale in its catalogues from the 1920s to the 1940s.

3549,How unusual is the solar system?,"In Isaac Asimov's Foundation series, the main characters are looking for the long-lost Earth. There are two major features of the solar system that seem to make it unusual among the millions of inhabited systems: the rings of Saturn and the size of the Moon.  The conversations below are mostly between Golan Trevize, ex-military, well-versed in astronomy, and Janov Pelorat, a naïve and recluse history teacher.  The rings of Saturn     ""That's what the poem was speaking of. Three wide rings, concentric, wider than the planet itself.""      Trevize said, ""I never heard of such a thing. I don't think rings can be that wide. Compared to the planet they circle, they are always very narrow.""            ""Is that sort of thing common?"" asked Bliss, awed.      ""No,"" said Trevize. ""Almost every gas giant has rings of debris, but they tend to be faint and narrow. I once saw one in which the rings were narrow, but quite bright. But I never saw anything like this; or heard of it, either.""      Pelorat said, ""That's clearly the ringed giant the legends speak of. If this is really unique-""      ""Really unique, as far as I know, or as far as the computer knows,"" said Trevize.   The Moon     ""A giant satellite is more difficult to accept. No other inhabited world in the Galaxy has such a satellite. Large satellites are invariably associated with the uninhabited and uninhabitable gas-giants. As a Skeptic, then, I prefer not to accept the existence of the moon.""            ""Yes. It's rather farther from the planet than one might expect but it's definitely revolving about it. It's only the size of a small planet; in fact, it's smaller than any of the four inner planets circling the sun. Still, it's large for a satellite. It's at least two thousand kilometers in diameter, which makes it in the size range of the large satellites that revolve about gas giants.""      ""No larger?"" Pelorat seemed disappointed. ""Then it's not a giant satellite?""      ""Yes, it is. A satellite with a diameter of two to three thousand kilometers that is circling an enormous gas giant is one thing. That same satellite circling a small, rocky habitable planet is quite another. That satellite has a diameter over a quarter that of Earth. Where have you heard of such near-parity involving a habitable planet?""      Pelorat said timidly, ""I know very little of such things.""      Trevize said, ""Then take my word for it, Janov. It's unique. We're looking at something that is practically a double planet, and there are few habitable planets that have anything more than pebbles orbiting them. Janov, if you consider that gas giant with its enormous ring system in sixth place, and this planet with its enormous satellite in third—both of which your legends told you about, against all credibility, before you ever saw them-then that world you're looking at must be Earth. It cannot conceivably be anything else. We've found it, Janov; we've found it.""   Quotes are from Foundation's Edge (1982) and Foundation and Earth (1986).  My question is in two parts:   Are the various descriptions and facts given above generally correct? How unusual are Saturn's rings and the Moon compared to other systems we've observed?  "
3550,"Why is the Sun so bright, but you can feel it far away?","First of all, the Sun's surface temperature is only about 6000 K. Years ago I was working at at a melt work with furnace temperatures 0f about 2-3000 K; of course you could not be near a furnace without protection, when it was open, but you could still stay some 20-30 metres away from it. Likewise, a light bulb has no long reach, till it fades away. But how about the Sun? Why can experience it at 150 000 000 km away?   Besides, I wonder why space is not heated up, because the heat radiating from all the stars and galaxies is so enormous, and actually the matter density in space is so low. How, actually, can heat be absorbed in space? What temperature is measured in space - is it just the wavelengths of radiations, from which temperature is calculated? "
3551,Could Tabby's star be beamed by a neutron star's jet causing irregular star spots?,"There have been some other questions here about what might cause the light curve dips of star KIC 8462852 as observed by Kepler Space Telescope. Here's one I haven't heard before:  Could it be that a neutron star, from Earth yet unobserved, or another supernova remnant in the relative vicinity of Tabby's star, hits it with its polar jet stream? Being in the focus of an irregular jet of charged particles would disturb the star's magnetic field, somehow causing star spot patterns, and upsetting its photosphere perhaps otherwise too.  Can this be excluded? "
3552,Revolution of Planets,Why do planets revolve around the sun? I understand that gravity plays a huge role in allowing it to move around. But what caused it to revolve in the first place?

3553,What if we throw two solid objects parallel in space? Do those two objects have any chance to collide with each other?,"What will happen if just throw two solid objects (for example, solid footballs) parallel in outer space and those two objects are floating and going far away in the universe.  So is there any possibility in which those two football-size solid objects can collide with each other, or will they will float parallel for an infinite amount of time in the universe?  I'm considering gravity also, and I find that other stars's and planets's gravitational pull can pull them into their gravitational fields and change their direction.  But what if those two objects will never get destroyed by luck? Could those will collide each other? "
3554,Calculating right ascension for two planets and their separation using python,"I am experimenting with the Python library PyEphem for astronomy, and I am trying to recreate/understand some of the basic calculations there.  There is a function called separation that, given two planets and a date/time, it calculates the separation (angle) between those 2 planets with respect to their ""x"" projection in a plane.  So for 2018/1/1 for planets Mercury and Mars, we have:  import ephem import math  mercury = ephem.Mercury('2018/1/1') mars = ephem.Mars('2018/1/1')  s1 = ephem.separation(mercury, mars) print(math.degrees(s1))   Which returns  33.792384499568264   But if I wanted to calculate this without the separation function, then I think that the calculation would be as simple as the ""right ascension"" of 1 minus the ""right ascension"" of the other:  math.degrees(mercury.ra) - math.degrees(mars.ra)   Which returns  35.114532008671574   Why are the angles different? Since I am not including a latitude and longitude of the observer, all the calculations are supposed to be geo-centric, according to PyEphem.  Is anybody familiar with the calculations going on behind PyEphem, or another library with built-in ephemeris that can produce consistent results for separation? "
3555,Could anything consume a small black hole?,"Whenever I read about black holes, it is normally involving how they devour anything that comes too close... regardless of how big anything is.  But what if it were a really small black hole vs something really large? How about something like a large star or neutron star... could a black hole be small enough to get devoured / consumed by something like that or would it just not be possible? "
3556,Length of a tidal day or by how much is the Moon late each day?,"A tidal day is the MEAN time between successive meridian transits of the Moon. (This is sometimes called called a lunar day, a term that should be deprecated for use in this sense, because it is also used for the length of a day on the Moon and should be reserved for the latter meaning to avoid ambiguity.) Its length exceeds a mean solar day of 24 hours by X minutes, which is also the (mean) time-length by which moonrise (or its meridian transit) is later each day than it was yesterday. (Here is an animation by NOAA demonstrating this principle.)  The exact value of X is variously given in different places, ranging from about 48 to 52. However, I cannot find anywhere an authoritative source detailing the ""correct"" way to calculate X.  Does anyone know of an authoritative method of calculating X, and/or can anyone comment on the three methods given below.  (1) I have a personal theory that puts X at about 48.763 minutes, but I am uneasy about how correct the underlying logic of it is, which is this:  Consider two successive conjunctions (C1 and C2) of the MEAN sun and MEAN moon. At C1, the Sun's azimuth and the Moon's azimuth will, at ALL places on Earth, be the same, and, although this is no longer true for the rest of the lunation, it will once again be true at C2. This is analogous to two clocks: Clock 1 (the MEAN sun) keeps correct time, while clock 2 (the MEAN moon) loses a constant amount of time (X minutes) each day. Since the two clocks agree at C1 and at C2, clock 2 must have lost exactly 24 hours (1440 minutes) during the intervening synodic lunation, whose length (Ln) is 29.5305891203704 days. This suggests that X (the number of minutes that clock 2 loses per day) = (1440 / Ln) = 48.763.  However, I feel uneasy about this logic for this reason: If C1 occurs on April 1 at 06:00:00, UTC, and it is then sunrise at Tema, Ghana (on the prime meridian, near the equator), C2 will be on April 30 at 18:44:03, UTC, and that will not be sunrise at Tema; it will be dusk there, and it will be sunrise at east longitude 169°.  Does this negate the above logic suggesting that X = 24 hours / Ln?  (2) Another method for calculating X suggested to me is this:  It is based on the Moon's sidereal period (Ld), 27.321661 days. The MEAN angular distance along its orbit travelled by the Moon each day is (360° / Ld) = 13.17636° (which equates to a mean orbital speed of about 0.55° per hour.) So, each day, the Earth must rotate 360° plus an extra 13.17636° to point the same meridian back at the Moon again. The Earth's rotational speed is (360° / 24 hrs) = 15° per hour. At that rate, the extra time needed by the Earth to rotate those extra 13.17636° is [(13.17636/360) * 24] = 0.878424 hour = 52.7 minutes.  (3) I argue that even if method (2) is right in principle, it requires two amendments, because:  (a) The Earth rotates 360° in a sidereal day, which is nearly 4 minutes shorter than 24 hours, in which time the Earth rotates nearly 361°, or, more precisely, 360.98565°. (The fraction in the latter value is obtained from the average daily portion of the Earth's orbit: 360°/365.2422 days = 0.985647° per day.) (An animation demonstrating why this is so is here.) So, the extra time needed by the Earth to rotate those extra 13.17636° is:  [(13.17636/360.98565)*24] = 0.8760 hours = 52.56 minutes.  (b) Furthermore, in those extra 52.56 minutes, the Moon has moved on in its orbit by nearly another half a degree. More precisely, it is (360/27.321661)*(52.56/1440) = 0.48094°. So the calculation should be:  [(13.17636+0.48094)/360.98565)*24] = 0.90800 hours = 54.48 minutes.   So we have three different methods of calculating X, yielding values of 48.763, 52.56 or 54.48 minutes.  Comments anyone? Either endorsements or criticisms of any of these three methods will be gratefully accepted. "

3559,What is meant by the bifurcation of hydrostatic equilibrium shapes in planetary formation?,"An intriguing comment below this question links to this Quora question and points to the answer by Robert Walker.   The sentence that particularly intrigued me is:     It turns out that there are two possible solutions, as the spin rate increases. You can get an oblate spheroid, or a triaxial ellipsoid - the solution ""bifurcates"". But the triaxial ellipsoid is the most stable of the two as Jacobi found out in his paper published in 1834.  Figures of Equilibrium - Historical Account* - Chandrasekar   It seems to refer both to an 1834 paper by Jacobi and it's reference in the 1964 paper Ellipsoidal figures of equilibrium—an historical account by S. Chandrasekhar, Communications on Pure and Applied Mathematics, 20 (2), May 1967, 251–265. While the latter is paywalled, there seems to be a readable version here in google in the book A Quest for Perspectives: Selected Works of S. Chandrasekhar : with Commentary By Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar, Kameshwar C. Wali, Volume 1. Imperial College Press, 2001.  Mathematical bifurcation is a fascinating topic and there is even an entire mathematics journal dedicated to the subject.  In this case, where exactly in the calculation of hydrostatic equillibrium of rotating bodies does this bifurcation (mentioned in the Quora answer) occur? I'm wondering if it simply means that for a given volume and density, below a certain rotation rate the hydrostatic equilibrium shape is an oblate sphere, but above it, the hydrostatic equilibrium shape will be a triaxial ellipsoid? Or is the bifurcation part of the evolution of the shape over time, involving viscocity or external effects?  If the triaxial ellipsoide is always(?) the most stable, then is a oblate spheroid actually an intermediate shape, and not really the shape of hydrostatic equillibrium? "

3563,How did they measure the distance to the center of our galaxy to 0.3% accuracy?,"The abstract of A geometric distance measurement to the Galactic center black hole with 0.3% uncertainty (Open Access) says:     We present a 0.16% precise and 0.27% accurate determination of R₀, the distance to the Galactic center. Our measurement uses the star S2 on its 16-year orbit around the massive black hole Sgr A* that we followed astrometrically and spectroscopically for 27 years. Since 2017, we added near-infrared interferometry with the VLTI beam combiner GRAVITY, yielding a direct measurement of the separation vector between S2 and Sgr A* with an accuracy as good as 20 μas in the best cases. S2 passed the pericenter of its highly eccentric orbit in May 2018, and we followed the passage with dense sampling throughout the year. Together with our spectroscopy, in the best cases with an error of 7 km s−1, this yields a geometric distance estimate of R₀ = 8178 ± 13stat. ± 22sys. pc. This work updates our previous publication, in which we reported the first detection of the gravitational redshift in the S2 data. The redshift term is now detected with a significance level of 20σ with fredshift = 1.04 ± 0.05.   and figure 2 shown below provides an example of the error analysis post fitting.   If you have the angular size of an orbit and a set of radial velocity measurements, even if it was viewed edge-on and the inclination was known, wouldn't this give only a parametric relationship between R₀ and the mass of the central object?  I don't understand how they were able to state a specific value for R₀, I'm probably missing something obvious but I can't figure it out. According to this answer:     We have reasonably good measurements of the mass of Sagittarius A*, thanks to measurements of the movements of stars like S0-2 over several decades. It's been well-established that the mass of the central object is [tex];   so to me the whole situation appears on the surface to be circular referencing. I'm sure it isn't of course, I'm just missing something. Is the measurement really to the ""Galactic center"" as the first sentence of the abstract states, or really the distance to Sgr A* around which S2 orbits? ""bonus points"" Why is every instance of ""Galactic"" in this published paper (not a preprint) capitalized?

3564,"Reflector vs refractor in terms of magnification, which one wins?","I'm thinking about getting a telescope and i'm debating between these 2 telescopes: meade and orion. Theyre both the same price so this question is not about the money, but about getting the most out of your money. I like the Meade 102 mm (or 4 inches) because it is a refractor, which means it is more lightweight and compact. The orion starblast 4.5 on the other hand is a reflector and therefore more clumsy.    My question is, is a reflector necessarily better than a refractor in terms of magnification and sharpness of image? The orion does have a slightly bigger aperture (half inch bigger) but I don't think that makes a huge difference. The question really is, a reflector vs a refractor, which one is more desirable in terms of magnification, and how much of a difference does it make?   Just judging from the reviews it would seem like the reflector (orion) wins the fight. For example, Saturn's rings according to some reviewers are ""clearly visible"" in the reflector, but not so with the refractor which most reviewers agree, Saturn will be very tiny and the rings barely visible.    So will I settle for magnification if I get the refractor instead of the reflector, or are they basically the same and in that case I would choose the refractor (meade) over the reflector since it is more compact, and is also easier for beginners like me? "
3565,The relation between the energy of star and heating effect,"Because a star's temperature is an indication of the energy passing through each unit of its surface, it follows that for cool red and hot blue stars of identical luminosities, the cooler red star must be considerably smaller so that the energy escapes through a reduced surface area and has a far greater heating effect. Hence, knowledge of a star's colour and luminosity can reveal its size.  In particular, I can't understand the relation between energy and the heating effect. Of course, I searched for the word ""the heating effect"" in my own language. Also, I Googled in English.   In this context, what is the heating effect? Could you explain to me? If you give me any help, it will be very useful to me.   "
3566,Time dilation at the Big Bang,"At the time the Big Bang happened the matter had enormous density. According the GR (I may be wrong here) such density dilates time.  If so, could it be that the time periods just after Big Bang which are usually considered happening in small part of a second (such as the Planck epoch), in reaity took billons of year (or may be, infinity) but due to time dilation appear to us as spanning only microscopic parts of a second? Could it be that the age of the universe is dramatically underestimated? "

3568,How far can you see in solar plasma at just under 1 solar radius?,"I was trying to compose an answer to this question here, about touching the surface of a star, and I was going to mention that the popular depiction of the sun's surface as 'basically lava' (as depicted in Sunshine, for example) is wrong.  The usual definition of a star's radius is where the optical depth is 2/3. At this radius, the density of the sun is about 1/10th of air at sea level and can hardly be described as solid or liquid.   I wanted to get a sense of what this diffuse plasma would look like if you were in it and somehow impervious to the heat and radiation. Would it appear as a thin, glowing fog, through which you could still discern distant objects? Or would it appear as opaque as, say, a bonfire?  Rephrasing in a little more technical way, What is the extinction coefficient of solar plasma at ~1 Solar radius in the visible spectrum?  What is the path length at which all light is effectively attenuated?  (Since it varies by wavelength, I mean specifically the region of the visible spectrum where the plasma is at its most transparent). "
3569,How far have stars been seen beyond the center of the Milky Way?,"What lies near the center of the galaxy is of great interest and in recent times the motion of dozen(s) of stars at the center of our galaxy orbiting around Sgr A* have been measured in great detail.

Question: How far have stars been seen beyond the center of the Milky Way? Though this area is opaque in visible wavelengths, infrared imaging and interferometry has led to sharp images near Sgr A*. But intentionally imaged or not, how far have objects been seen beyond this distance but appearing near the center of the galaxy due to geometry? Have stars been imaged clear through the center and out into the far side of the galaxy?  Any wavelength is fine, as long as it's image-like and the answer indicates that the object lies beyond the center of the galaxy and how that could be determined.    above: homemade GIF from ESA video ESOcast 173: First Successful Test of Einstein’s General Relativity Near Supermassive Black Hole "

Kepler 22, 638 ly away, was discovered to have a planet Kepler 22b, calculated to be twice the size of Earth.  The observations that make these measurements aren't high resolution images but periodic changes in luminosity (the transit method).  My question is: would a similar situation with similar telescope properties (Kepler) detect our own Earth around our Sun from a similar distance? If not, then how close would you have to be to see Earth?  Presumably there is some correspondence among: distance, luminosity/size of a star, size of a planet.

My question is, if our moon once had a rotation, has it slowed down to a point where across the course of our normal lifetimes we can't observe it's spin but across the span of hundreds, if not thousands, of years we could observe its current rotation?  In other words, if it has a rotation and if I looked at the moon today and jumped into the future, how far would I have to go to see a noticeable difference?    If the question is to relative then I'll ask it like this-- at the moons current rate of rotational speed and deceleration, how long would it take for the moon to rotate, say, 15 degrees on it's current axis?  I assume this would be enough to make the moon look ""different"" to the naked eye so I'll go with that concrete figure.  ...or is the moon in either a state of near-equilibrium or is it ""wobbling"" due to other forces outside the gravitational pull of the earth (e.g. pull of the sun, asteroid bombardment, comets passing by, etc.) having minor effects on its rotational state and thus making it's rotation inconsistent and unobservable?

3583,Remains of the progenitor of the Sun,"It has been argued that it is not possible to trace back the remains of the progenitor star of the Sun (sometimes called Coatlicue), which, being estimated in the mass range of 30 [tex], should have left a black hole after its explosion as a supernova, nor is it possible to find the sister stars formed from the compression of the same nebula:  [website][website]because ""[The Sun] has completed many Galactic orbits [since its formation]. Not only that, but it could have migrated in orbital radius as well."" and ""These twin stars did not influence its development nor that of its planets [and] are now dispersed in the Galaxy and cannot be identified"".  Why did the supernova's remains and the sister stars not remain gravitationally bound together? Why did they not share the same angular momentum of revolution around the Galaxy?

3586,"What is the cause of all of these sharp, concentric rings around bright stars in this HST image?","ESA's HST page heic1819 — Photo Release; Hubble reveals cosmic Bat Shadow in the Serpent’s Tail is of course beautiful and stunning, but my eyes are drawn to the diffraction artifacts of the bright stars.  I'm assuming the crosses are due to four vanes supporting the secondary mirror, but are the tight concentric rings due to Hubble's large aperture, or it's smaller secondary mirror blocking that aperture, or something else, perhaps image processing?  Without a scale for reference, it's hard to get an angular frequency and compare to an Airy-like diffraction pattern to get a diameter, and that's where it gets more puzzling, because you need a narrow wavelength range to get a coherent oscillation for so many cycles (I think I can see perhaps 15 or more sharp, distinct rings), and to zeroth order stars are mostly black-body.  Is this a bit of a puzzle, or am I missing something obvious (e.g. filters)? Or both?  Here's a cropped, monochromed, ROI:    Further stretched in contrast and size:     "
3587,Is a comet necessarily confined to the solar system?,"I had the following question:     A comet enters the solar system. Assume that it is influenced only by the Sun, not by any of the planets. Which statement about its orbit is correct?    And I chose as correct statement:     Its orbit might be an ellipse, or is might be a parabola or a hyperbola (because a comet is not necessarily confined to the solar system forever).   I want to know what it means by a comet is not necessarily confined to the solar system forever.  Does it mean that eventually the comet will ""die"" out, with the sun vaporizing all of its ice, so it will basically cease to exist while it is in the solar system?  Or does it mean that the comet can leave the solar system? If the comet enters the solar system it is subject to the mighty force of the suns gravity, then how can it escape? "
3588,How can gravity lead to the Big Crunch scenario?,"According to modern cosmology, space is expanding, causing proper distances (but not comoving distances) to increase between galaxies. In the Big Crunch hypothesis, gravity halts and reverses the expansion of the Universe, causing all matter to collide and eventually form a single black hole. This gives way to other oscillating universe hypotheses, which generally propose that the conditions in a compressed Universe would be the same as those during the Big Bang, leading a cycle of expanding and contracting universes.  Ignoring the problems with entropy in reverting the Universe to Big Bang conditions, how can gravity be the cause of a Big Crunch in the first place? Specifically, gravity (to my knowledge) only curves space; the idea that it can revert the Universe to the conditions of the Big Bang seems to imply that gravity actually can contract space. Is this actually the case?  If not, the gravitating objects should be moving through a comoving coordinate system, so space itself would not actually be contracting. As far as I can tell, we would have all the Universe's matter compressed within a single point in space, instead of space itself contracting. This should be completely unlike the Big Bang, when space was far less dilated than it is now. If this is in fact what the Big Crunch hypothesis describes, than I'm utterly confused as to how an oscillating universe could work in such a situation.  Am I mistaken, or do the Big Crunch and oscillating universe hypotheses imply that gravity actually contracts space (as in, the comoving distances of gravitationally attracting objects would not change)? If not, how could gravity possibly lead to these scenarios? "
3589,Could the Universe really be 12.5-13 billion years old?,"My initial reaction is that ""this must be wrong"" and apparently that's a lot of people's initial reaction according to the article.  [website]My question is, is this study actually making scientists scratch their heads, and, 2nd part, if accurate, how could the 13.78 (or whatever it is) estimate have been wrong, as it seemed to be the result of more and more accurate estimates over time.  One of the two estimates has to be wrong. "
3590,"How does V838 Monocerotis look today? Any subsequent light echo images, or is the party over?","This answer to the question V838 Monocerotis “light-echo” images morphed into nice video, but why so few original images? contains the following information below. There are other answers and more images there, so it's recommended to enjoy there as well.  Question: What does V838 Monocerotis look like today? Have there been subsequent light echo image sequences, or is the party over?  See also Why weren't the Hubble light-echo images of V838 Monocerotis supplemented by ground telescopes?      The V838 Monocerotis expansion (not a supernova) and the observation of the subsequent ""spectacular"" light echo was quite a notable event! From Nature 422, 405-408 (27 March 2003)    From Astronom. J. 135, 2, 2008 or ArXiv     "".Galactic light echoes are extremely rare. The only other known example of extent similar to that of V838 Mon was the echo produced by Nova GK Persei 1901 (Kapteyn 1902; Perrine 1902; Ritchey 1902). Following early misunderstandings, light-echo geometry was properly described by Couderc (1939), and more recent discussions are given by many authors, including Chevalier (1986), Felten (1991), Sparks (1994), Sugerman (2003), and references therein"".   It was the sole topic of an international conference photo from here:   Figure 2 of the Nature paper describes the preservation of the actual light curve (history) within the structure of the light-echo shell:       ""FIGURE 2.

Imaging on 30 April was obtained only in the B filter, but B, V and I were used on the other three dates, allowing us to make full-colour renditions. The time evolution of the stellar outburst (Fig. 1) is reflected by structures visible in these colour images. In b, for example, note the series of rings and filamentary structures, especially in the upper right quadrant.

3591,Could the rotation of a black hole cause other planets to rotate?,"Because everything rotates so perfectly, and we know that some blackholes rotate and they're the biggest things in the universe, so a silly question comes to mind.  If you remove all black holes from a galaxy:   Would it still rotate? Would the rotation of the planets inside it slow down until there's no more rotation/gravity?   I imagine that the black hole has something to do with the fact that we have gravity since it's always rotating and pulling spacetime fabric inward like a tornado. There are 100 million black holes in our galaxy so I think of them as rotation generators.  Last year I read a research paper that the rotation of a black hole can't cause gravity, but forgot why. "
3592,Why didn't Johannes Kepler use data about more planets?,"In Astronomia Nova (1609) Johannes Kepler used observations of Mars in order to refute circular orbits. Throughout Astronomia Nova he hardly even mentions other planets than Mars, Earth and the Sun (and the Moon in a different context). Were there any astronomical reasons for him not to continue, or even beginning, his investigation by using data about other planets?  Tycho Brahe had collected corresponding data about the other planets too, right? 20 years of data is enough for Saturn to make 2/3 of its period. Jupiter and Saturn have almost twice as frequent oppositions as does Mars. And Mercury has twice the eccentricity and its much shorter period should help getting data about its apsides when it is best seen.   Would it had helped him to use several planets during the process as he describes it in Astronomia Nova? Was it simply the calculation capacity which limited him from dragging several planets into it? Or could he somehow conclude that it is enough to solve for Mars, to know that his physical conclusions of interests are valid for all planets?  "

3594,"How did the Mars satellites ""take cover"" from the recent comet flyby?","After comet Sliding Spring's Oct. 19, 2014 close flyby of Mars, NASA reports that      All three NASA orbiters around Mars confirmed their healthy status Sunday after each took shelter behind Mars during a period of risk from dust [from the comet's tail].   ""Took shelter behind Mars""?  These spacecraft are in orbit around Mars, constantly in motion, so they can't very well just pack up and move to the other side of Mars to avoid getting hit with the dust.  So my questions are: What exactly qualifies as taking shelter behind Mars?  Does it simply mean being on the other side of the planet from the tail of the comet as dust from the tail passed Mars?  How did NASA get the (constantly in motion) spacecraft to hide behind Mars?  I assume that the orbits had to be modified in advance of the comet's arrival. I picture some orbital modifications that changed the phase of the orbits of the satellites so that they would be on the other side of Mars as the dust flew by, perhaps also making the orbits more elliptical with the apsis behind Mars, allowing the satellites to spend additional time in Mars' protection.  Will these orbital modifications affect the ability of the spacecraft to fulfil their primary missions as they relate to Mars?  I am not asking whether dust from the comet will affect the quality of the instruments on the spacecraft (indeed, this whole question focuses on steps NASA is taking to prevent that from happening) but whether the altered orbits the spacecraft have after their orbital modifications will affect their ability to pursue their primary missions (such as flying over different parts of Mars than was originally intended, which may or may not be beneficial to answering the questions the spacecraft were originally launched to answer.  Although scientists are nothing if not resourceful and I'm sure any data that come from the spacecraft, whether intended or not, will lead to important discoveries). "
3595,"What is a ""semester series"" for eclipse prediction? - Solar saros series 147 and 152","Yet again, I just stumbled across another baffling eclipse question (actually, two now). I was interested in two eclipses (Saros series 147 and 152) that will both be occurring in 2021. Each of these eclipses will occur relatively near the opposite poles of the earth. The Wikipedia link for saros 147 provided the following additional information:     ""Solar eclipses of 1964-1967[edit]      This eclipse is a member of a semester series. An eclipse in a   semester series of solar eclipses repeats approximately every 177 days   and 4 hours (a semester) at alternating nodes of the Moon's orbit.[1]   ""   These are both fairly young saros series. Saros 152 is comprised of 70 eclipses, while saros 147 contains a total of 80 eclipses. Observations: They are 10 eclipses difference in length - They each began 180 years apart. So, following on from that, I checked out their ending dates and found, much to my amazement, that both series end during the exact same year - exactly 177 day apart - in the year 3049 !!!  So, since this additional information, my new questions concerning these eclipses have become:      1) What exactly is a ""semester series"" for eclipses (any detail)? The day spacing definition is obvious but doesn't explain much else.       2) Does this mean that some or all eclipses in series 147 and 152 are in   the same semester series?  "

3597,Do we get any benefit from being in a galaxy?,"If our solar system were to somehow be created outside of a galaxy as a single star in the vast nothingness between galaxies, would life on Earth change any?

3598,"Why does an open universe expand forever, while a closed one does not?","It makes sense to me that the universe would eventually stop expanding, as bodies of mass attract each other, and I understand that dark energy can counteract this attraction. However, I don't understand how an open universe can expand forever without dark energy. Why is a closed universe any different? What about negatively-curved space allows the universe to maintain a fast enough expansion velocity? "
3599,"What is it exactly about these flares of infrared light from Sgr A* that ""confirms"" it is a supermassive black hole?","CNET.com's SCI-TECH Scientists confirm a 'supermassive black hole' at the heart of our galaxy It's ""mind-boggling"", they say.  This links to Astronomy.com's Scientists finally confirm the Milky Way has a supermassive black hole This links to ESO's eso1835 — Science Release Most Detailed Observations of Material Orbiting close to a Black Hole; ESO’s GRAVITY instrument confirms black hole status of the Milky Way centre  FYI, the GRAVITY instrument measures infrared light, not gravity.   What is it exactly about these flares of infrared light from Sgr A* that confirms it is a supermassive black hole?  Certainly there is plenty of evidence, the orbits of stars nearby for one. But this use of the word confirm seems strong and frequent enough to suggest the deal has been done, the ink is dry, and it's a black hole without question and that until now that wasn't so.

3600,How can a gas planet become tidally locked with a star?,"Supposing a planet is made entirely of gas, is it possible for the planet to become tidally locked with the star it orbits?   I know when a terrestrial planet orbits a star in a different amount of time than the length of its day, the planet warps continuously, resulting in tidal heating. This heating takes energy from the planet's rotation until it stabilizes in a tide-locked formation.   I believe a purely gaseous planet would also have some sort of internal heating for the same reason. But because the ""surface"" of a gas planet is fluid, it must also obey thermodynamic principles.  As a basic example, the side of the planet facing a star gets hot, and the side facing away gets cold. The hot gas expands and the cold gas contracts and you get convection, Hadley cycles, prevailing winds, and chaotic weather patterns.  So it seems like there's a battle between gravity, which wants the gas to stop moving and become tide-locked, and thermodynamics, which wants the surface to roil with convection.  Does one process dominate over the other? Does one process slowly take over as the other fades away? Can it go either way? "
3601,Is it accurate to say that we have a gravitational attraction towards all objects in the known universe?,"Its probably small, but is there a theoretical gravitational attraction between all objects in the universe? Light can move pretty far, so does that mean gravity can as well, and is the gravity blocked by the same way light is blocked by an object? "
3602,When are the planets occulted by the sun?,"There are numerous lists available of past and future planetary transits and occultations, but I can't find any that list transits behind the sun.  Do the planets in our solar system ever pass directly behind the sun, from Earth's perspective? Is there a special name for this kind of occultation, and is there a list of these events? "
3603,Why objects are uniquely defined by their right ascention and declination?,"I've just started studiyng Astronomy.  I understood how I would measure Right Ascention and Declination: for the first one I'd trace an Hour cirlce to the Celestial Equator, and then, compute the angle from this point and the Vernal Equinox; while the second one is the angle subtended by the object and the intersection of the Hour Circle with the Celestial Equator.  So, during the night, stars will change their Right Ascension value? Does this means this coordinate system is not fixed with respect to the stars?  If so, why people store the RA/Dec to find objects? For instance, I know  the RA/Dec of the NGC 5585 Galaxy ( [website]"
3604,Can a black hole formation be stopped or interrupted,"My question is a hypothetical: if I were to create a black hole the size of a family house, in New York, is there any way that it can be stopped, or interrupted? If a black hole of this size is formed, will everyone die? "
3605,How do we know a star's age based on its spectrum?,"A star's nearby environment may give clue to its age.  Different stellar type have different spectral features. If we just have its spectrum, how do we know its age?  For example, a star may be born with a M3-type(I know it is more difficult for M-type compared with OBAFGK) and stay here for a long time. How do we know it was born with a M3-type?  How do we know its age?   It is better to talk about different stellar types and give reference papers. "

Is it the drastic element changes on the Earth such as extreme temperatures or flooding, etc. Do we have any percent of surviving on Earth? "
3607,Why the blank wedges in this very early 21 cm map of the Milky Way? (Oort et al. 1958),"Jan Oort was a pioneer in radio astronomy. Wikipedia says:     It has been written that “Oort was probably the first astronomer to realize the importance” of radio astronomy. “In the days before radio telescopes,” one source notes, “Oort was one of the few scientists to realise the potential significance of using radio waves to search the heavens. His theoretical research suggested that vast clouds of hydrogen lingered in the spiral arms of the Galaxy. These molecular clouds, he predicted, were the birthplaces of stars.”   The article includes the image shown below, which is a 21 cm radio map of the Milky Way galaxy. (for more on the transparency of dust at 21 cm see this excellent answer to How was the galactic plane established?  You can also read more about Oort's work during this time in this 1976 AIP Oral History Interview interview.   I'm guessing that the center of the plot is the galactic center and the point at 8 kpc above it is the Earth. What is the reason for the two blank wedges, projecting downward and upward from the Earth? Are they geometrical, blind spots from the few early radio telescopes in the 1950's perhaps, or do they reflect real phenomenon in the galaxy?

3608,Could the trajectories of non-periodic comets be used to infer properties of the 'ninth planet'?,"Non-periodic comets are comets which have very long orbital periods (>200 years or more), spending most of their time in the outer solar system.  Planet X, recently revived by researchers at Caltech, is a proposed planet orbiting in the farthest reaches of the outer solar system. The Caltech researchers infer its presence from to its effect on the orbits of Kuiper belt objects.  If such a planet exists, and is the cause of the Kuiper belt object alignments, could it not also knock such objects in to the inner solar system, creating non-periodic comets with huge aphelion orbital distances? Could our current observations of non-periodic comets be used to infer properties of the planet? "
3609,How are stellar elemental abundances quoted?,"Close to the bottom of page 4 of this article (marked as page 164 in the upper left corner) states      Values are given in the logarithmic scale usually adopted by astronomers, A[tex] = log N[tex]/N[tex] + 12.0, where N[tex] is the abundance by number.   I have never used stellar elemental abundances in this way, so I want to check a few things.  First of all, is the logarithm used by this paper log[tex] or log[tex] (often written ln)?  My guess is log[tex] because of what follows.  Let's say I want to calculate the elemental abundance of He relative to H.  I believe the correct math would be to do the following  [tex]  Is this the correct way to calculate the relative abundances?  This equation gives a value of 0.343 for the helium abundance relative to hydrogen, which seems to be the correct value for the sun (the sun is usually quotes as being about 70% H and about 25% He, which gives a relative abundance of 0.357).  This correct value is what leads me to believe that the log is log[tex]. "
3610,What is the angle between the planes of Oumuamua's hyperbola and the Milky Way Galaxy?,"Viewing the animations of Oumuamua passing through the solar system, it is apparent that the plane of its hyperbola departs from the plane of the ecliptic by a large amount.  The plane of the ecliptic departs from that of the Milky Way Galaxy by a large amount.  Now that there is so much speculation about a potential artificial origin, one might be forgiven for speculating that there might be a coincidence between the Milky Way Galaxy's plane and that of Oumuama.

The star also has a radial component of its velocity, coming towards earth at 4.3 km/s. What is the time and distance of closest approach?   I know how to do 1. but I am not sure how to approach 2. "
3614,Is it odd that our Sun has so many planets?,"The internet is abuzz with the new evidence of the possible ninth planet in our Solar System. With those nine objects, the asteroid belt, the Kuiper belt, and everything else in our Solar System - the number of objects which orbit our star is pretty massive. Is this odd for a star its size? It's known that our Sun is a comparatively small star, so does having so many planets make it an oddity? Or do larger stars tend to have dozens or planets, even hundreds? "
3615,How does the orbit of a 2-body system evolve as it orbits a more massive 3rd body?,"I have been reading up on how multiplicity of star systems decline with star mass, which implies a relatively common occurrence of binary star systems orbiting more massive stars. I would imagine this would also mean the orbital plane of such multi-star systems aligning with the orbital plane of the system and the star it orbits as time passes, which I believe is in line with how disc accretion is such a common pattern.  What I am wondering is how such a realignment would affect behavior of the orbit of a hypothetical binary system? Would the stars get closer to the barycenter or further as this realignment occurs? How about periodicity or heat? "

3622,Solar series 142 and 147 started same year - series 147 and 152 will be ending same year. Why? Coincidence?,"   This question was left over from the last question I had, so I am asking it separately here:   I have been looking into two solar eclipses (Saros series 147 and 152) that will both be occurring in 2021. Each of these eclipses will be happening near the opposite poles of the earth.  Both are part of young saros series. Saros 152 is comprised of 70 eclipses, while saros 147 contains a total of 80 eclipses. These series are 10 eclipses difference in length and began 180 years apart. So, I happened to check out their ending dates and found that both series are projected to end during the exact same year - 177 day apart – together in the year 3049. I thought that both of these series ending together one semester apart in the very same year was a pretty amazing coincidence.  So, checking further – it seems new saros series start from as few as 7 years apart to as many as 100 years apart (this is extremely variable spacing, but it averages to about 31 years apart over the usual 1260+ year active series lifespan). I wanted to know why series 147 and 152 would both be ENDING at the same time.  I went back to the NASA website, and checked the 5000 year listing of all solar saros series numbering 0 through 180. I only found one other such instance of two solar saros series ENDING in the same year – series 49 and 54 both ENDED together in 32 CE – so it seems like a pretty rare event.  But then, I checked to see if there were any occasions of two saros series BEGINNING together in the same year. Going back to the NASA website again with this question, I checked the 5000 year listing of all solar saros series numbering 0 through 180. I only found one single example of two saros series both BEGINNING in the same year. This time series 142 and 147 both BEGAN together in the year 1624 CE.  Not only is solar saros 147 involved in BOTH of these ""same year"" cases, but all three series eclipses will be presenting themselves during a single upcoming semester series in 2021 – solar series 142 (Dec 14, 2020), 147 (June 10, 2021), and 152 (Dec 4, 2021).      Can anyone explain to me the actual mechanics behind what causes saros series to begin and end? I am familiar with Saros/Inex   Panorama – but unfortunately they do not answer this question, and I   can’t even read them online anyway.      Does anyone know why solar saros 147 may have STARTED in the same year as saros 142 or why saros 147 will be ENDING together in the same   year as saros 152? Are these two occasions both very rare   coincidences, while at the same time, both involve the same series 147?  "

Assume a horoscope is created by dividing the ecliptic into 12 equal regions and then for a particular day noting which region each of the 7 ""wandering stars"" is occupying relative to the earth. For example, a horoscope could be: Sun in Aries, Moon in Capricorn, Saturn in Taurus, Jupiter in Libra, Mars in Pisces, Venus in Aries, Mercury in Aries.  Since Saturn revolves around the sun once every 29 earth years, Jupiter every 12 years, and Mars 1.88 or so, multiplying together we have 654. So, relative to each, they would seem to repeat their configuration every 654 years.  This is potentially a complicated question which might require a simulation to determine the answer. For example, today (5 December 2016), the following is true for the tropical zodiac:  Sun in Sagittarius Moon in Aquarius Mercury in Capricorn Venus in Capricorn Mars in Aquarius Jupiter in Libra Saturn in Sagittarius  So, one instance of this problem would be to determine the next date at which this same configuration will next recur.

3626,"If the Moon were impacted by a suitably sized meteor, how long would it take to impact the Earth?","An answer to the question of How well would the Moon protect the Earth from a Meteor? mentions as a possibility that the Moon could get knocked into the Earth.  What is the smallest change to the orbit of the Moon from being impacted by a large meteor that would cause it to eventually impact the Earth (i.e. ""circling the drain"")? What timeline would that look like (minutes, hours, days, years, etc)?  "
3627,Gravity assist: why is the velocity doubled?,"The Wikipedia article has this terrestrial analogy:  Imagine standing on a train platform, and throwing a [tennis] ball at 30 km/h toward a train approaching at 50 km/h. The driver of the train sees the ball approaching at 80 km/h and then departing at 80 km/h after the ball bounces elastically off the front of the train. Because of the train's motion, however, that departure is at 130 km/h relative to the train platform; the ball has added twice the train's velocity to its own.  I have two problems with this:   The train's speed relative to the platform is 50 km/h. The ball, traveling in the opposite direction, is going at 30 km/h. Thus, the train operator will indeed see the ball at    50 + 30 = 80 km/h.   So far, so good. However, once the ball has hit the front of the train (let's assume that no speed at all is lost in the process), it'll have the train's velocity (50 km/h) added to its own (30 km/h):   50 + 30 = 80 km/h.   Because the train's velocity relative to the platform is 50 km/h, and the ball's now 80 km/h, the operator will see it departing from him at  80 - 50 = 30 km/h.   As already mentioned above, the ball's velocity relative to the platform after the bounce will be   The train's velocity (50 km/h) + the ball's initial velocity (30 km/h) = 80 km/h, and not twice the train's velocity.   What am I missing?  Addendum:  This is kind of comical:  You're watching a tennis match. Player A serves the ball at 200 km/h. Player B returns the serve, the speed of his racket added to DOUBLE the speed of the ball. Player A then puts in a ground stroke, and the speed of the ball doubles again. If they keep this up, then, according to the above logic, the speed of the ball relative to the court will be approaching the speed of light before they know it.  Again: what am I missing? "
3628,Are there galaxies with 2 or more super massive black holes orbiting each other?,We now know that most stellar systems have 2 or more stars orbiting each other. Do we know of any galaxies which have 2 or more super massive black holes orbiting each other? Is it possible? 
3629,Sunrise - from earth - sun position or when sun rays reaches earth?,Time for the sun rays to reach earth is approximately 8 mins.   If time of the sun rise is 7:30 - which time is this? Time when sun rays reaches earth or time when earth and sun comes into correct position where sun is visible again after night?  If it is time when sun rays reaching earth - that means sun is already 8 mins away from that first position.  If it is second option - it means it's still 8 mins to wait until we actually see 'sun rising' - sun rays reaching earth.  So which time sun rise really is? 
3630,Viewing a solar eclipse through a leafy tree,"Viewing my Facebook feed today, my local news station posted regarding a solar eclipse taking place today:    Note the line about using a leafy tree as a filter:     Scientists say NOT to directly look at the sun (if skies are clearing where you are), but looking at the eclipse through a leafy tree creates a natural filter!   I've heard a lot of people recommend viewing a solar eclipse by looking at the projection of the eclipse caused by light passing between leaves in a tree, in this case looking at the ground or a wall, where ever the light hits after passing through the tree.  However, the Facebook posting here seems to recommend looking up at the solar eclipse through the tree.  I suspect that they have misunderstood the projection method (or inadequately explained), and their advice is not only wrong, but potentially dangerous.  Is this method recommendable? Should it be considered dangerous?  Follow-up  Almost immediately upon having seen the posting I had commented on it noting my belief that such advice could be dangerous, including a more clear explanation of how viewing using trees should be done. The staff member who originally posted the status later took note of this and edited the status to less ambiguously explain viewing the projection. Unfortunately, this was done after the solar eclipse had concluded. Hopefully no damage was done. "
3631,How was the hypothetical ninth planet kicked so far out of the Solar System?,"I was reading this article on science news and ran into the following statement:     Such a remote super-Earth probably originated closer to the sun only to be kicked out by the other giant planets during the solar system’s formative years, Batygin and Brown suggest.    I was wondering, how was this planet kicked so far out of the Solar System?  Why only one planet? "

3635,Have more recent LIGO/VIRGO gravitational wave measurements narrowed down the speed of gravity further?,"This answer to How precise are the observational measurements for the speed of gravity? says:     ...in 2013 a Chinese group built a model using Earth's tides that helped them narrow it down.             ... [T]he speeds of gravity are from 0.93 to 1.05 times the speed of light with a relative error of about 5%. This provides first set of strong evidences to show that the speed of gravity is the same as the speed of light.         This is so far the most accurate measurement I've seen.  See the paper for more.      In the near future, LIGO may be able to provide more accurate measurements by comparing the distance among detectors and the delay of observation.     In case the links break, the papers are:   ""Observational evidences for the speed of the gravity based on the Earth tide"" TANG KeYun et al.

3636,Just out of curiosity. What's this curvature per unit length for a sphere? I see a lot of flat earthers using it.,I've seen most flat earthers mention if earth was a sphere the earth should curve at x value per unit length. Is that even a proper logic? Radius of curvature is constant for sphere and a circle of a particular radius. If that logic exist can anyone share a simple diagram? I just can't comprehend how they got to that logic. Thanks in advance. 
3637,Can we observe changes in the CMB (surface of last scattering) over time?,"It is hard to determine the age of the Sun, because it won't change much over 100 million years or so. But what about the cosmic microwave background radiation, that is being mapped with ever better precision. It dates to only about 380 000 years after Big Bang. Is it possible to observe changes in it over a period of 10 years or 100 years, as it ages and cools, as the Hubble Bubble expands?  And how is the landscape of the CMB-map expected to change? Are relatively cool and hot areas permanent over time scale much larger than 380 000 years, or would our CMB-map be unrecognizable if we had lived, say, a billion years earlier or later? "
3638,Are the viewable nebulae only in our galaxy?,"Where are all the nebulae located?  Yes, a simple question that should be obvious but apparently is not to me.  To be more explicit, how far are all these objects? Are they mostly in our galaxy?  I'm not suggesting that the Milky Way galaxy is the only galaxy that has nebulae, but that the ones we have pictures of are only within the Milky Way...if that is indeed the case.  This may also apply to stars themselves. What is the radius in ly of discernibility of (most) stars? Is it beyond the distance to the center of our galaxy (where even in principle individual stars might be discernible but there's too much of a mess to differentiate)? "
3639,Do massive OB stars accrete mass the same way as the black holes they turn into do?,"It is often said, in spite of sci fi often having illustrated the opposite, that stellar mass black holes do not gravitationally attract material in their environment into themselves anymore than a star with similar mass does. But how and why do blue stars of about 8-10 or more Solar masses which turn into black holes, change how frequently and observably they accrete material from their environment when they transform into BH? Maybe because the supernova ejects material, some of which doesn't get far and is re-accreted when the stellar wind ceases?  BH's are visible when they have active accretion disks. Do massive O and B stars also have such accretion disks as frequently? "
3640,Is it possible to break apart a neutron star?,"I was inspired by this question on Physics, as well as this question right here on Astronomy. Neutron stars are tightly bound together as neutron degenerate matter. They're very massive and have a strong gravitational field. Is it possible to break one apart into sizable chunks? How would you do this?    The answers given are good and answer my question; I'll just clarify some one thing (based on the comments) for posterity.  I would define ""broken"" as when any significant amount of mass is removed from the neutron star, as in mass shedding, as Mitch Goshorn wrote. The resulting object, however, should contain a significant amount of neutron matter - that is, it should largely retain its prior composition. "
3641,Ninth planet - what else could it be?,"So recently it was announced that there might be a ninth planet out there.  Some people (from NASA) say the odds are 50% that it is a real planet, since it hasn't been discovered by telescopes yet.  Let's say there is no ninth planet. Is there another explanation for those orbits that require a big mass (8 times earth mass) out there?  Could it even be a very small black hole (a few centimeters in radius) or maybe a clump of dark matter? "

3645,Which Chandrasekhar Limit do I use? 1.39 or 1.44?,"Different sources online say that the Chandrasekhar Limit is either 1.40 or 1.39, or 1.44 solar masses. Why the discrepancy? I heard it might have to do with the composition of the white dwarf, but, correct me if I'm wrong, don't pretty much all white dwarf stars have the same composition? "
3646,How can we see stars if they are hundred years of light far from the Earth?,"So the right question is, is the light years counted from that second when you look up to the sky? If that so, how can we see the stars from the telescope (which I think it starts when you put your eyes on it, same as when you look up to the sky), that they say it's 5000 of light years from earth? If you say these lights are already started 5000 years of light ago, then there should be so many changes happened to these galaxies or stars in that timeline. Thus, for example, there should be no way to know, if an earth-like extrasolar planet is still earth-like. "
3647,What is the shape of the Sun's orbit around the Earth taking into account elliptical orbits?,"Consider the non-inertial frame that is at rest with respect to the Earth's revolution around the Sun.  (Ignore the Earth's rotation around its own axis.)  My question is, what is the shape of the Sun's orbit around the Earth in this reference frame?  Now if we assume the Earth moves in a circular orbit around the Sun, then the Sun's orbit around the Earth will also be circular. (Just use geometric the definition of a circle - the set of all points a fixed distance from a given point.). Specifically it's the great circle formed by the intersection of the ecliptic plane with the celestial sphere.  But the Earth does not move in a circular orbit - Kepler's first law states that the Earth moves in an ellipse around the Sun, with the Sun at one of the foci of the ellipse.  So if we consider the Earth's elliptical orbit around the Sun, what is the shape of the Sun's orbit around the Earth.  I doubt it's an ellipse, so would be it a more complicated-looking curve.  Note that I'm not interested in gravitational influences from the moon and other planets - this is pretty much a purely mathematical question: if we assume the Earth moves in an ellipse, what would be the shape produced? "
3648,Are we sure solar cycle is not related to the orbit of Jupiter?,"Are we still debating the relationship between Jupiter and solar cycle?

3649,What will eLISA be trying to observe?,"eLisa - Evolved Laser Interferometer Space Antenna.     A LISA-like mission is designed to directly observe gravitational waves, which are distortions of space-time travelling at the speed of light. Passing gravitational waves alternately squeeze and stretch objects by a tiny amount. Gravitational waves are caused by energetic events in the universe and, unlike any other radiation, can pass unhindered by intervening mass. Launching eLISA will add a new sense to scientists' perception of the universe and enable them to listen to a world that is invisible in normal light.   The ""duh"" answer to my question is ""Gravity waves, of course.""  Obviously this is not what I'm asking.  So, we've deployed eLISA and we spotted a gravitational wave passing. Well, there went the wave. What data do we extract from it? What discoveries, observations will we acquire? What else can we discover with it than ""there was a gravity wave, and it came from this direction""? "
3650,How would Special relativity explain past-present-future if thinking about 13-billion-light-years distanced objects,"Halo.  I'm interested in how would Special relativity comment on this:  Suppose there are 2 objects, A and B. They are 13 billion light years away from each other.  When the light from the B object reaches the A, the observer at the A object sees what the (suppose planet, people, objects) were like 13 billion years ago on that object. Let's say it is also an Earth-like planet where the living creatures like exist.  And if the observer at the A object would like to imagine, what is now happening there, what would be the result:   Surely, he would have to wait another 13 billion years to actually see Would that mean that the inhabitants (if any) or just matter and objects at object B exist in future relative to A ones. And vice versa? If yes, then they both live in present, past and future tenses at the same time?   Or have I completely lost my way of properly understanding the Special relativity? "

The Drake Equation is on: [website]I have also heard that there could possibly be life in the upper atmosphere of Jupiter, which could have floating beasts, and also on Titan, which does have surface liquids, but I am pretty sure most of it is in solid form.  If the Drake Equation is equal to a low number, then why is it pretty common if there is a possibility of life on 2 moons and 1 planet? Does that make the Drake Equation a non-reliable source?

This photon has been traveling for 13+billion years through the vastness of space without ever hitting anything.  Sure, it's probably been tugged at by gravitational interactions, but it's still happily traveling at the speed of light without direct interaction with matter.   As we know, most of the universe is composed of mostly empty space.  The odds of any single photon hitting something (like the Earth as starlight, etc) would seem to be very small.

3661,Conversion of UBVRIJHK magnitudes to luminosity?,"So, I know that the standard for conversion from bolometric magnitude to luminosity established in 2015 equates to:  L = 10^(-0.4 * magnitude) * 3.0128e28   Easy enough. But what does one do about luminosities in specific bands? I've seen some information that makes it look like it should be something like:  U: 10^(0.4*(5.61 - U-band magnitude)) * 3.828e26 B: 10^(0.4*(5.48 - B-band magnitude)) * 3.828e26 V: 10^(0.4*(4.83 - V-band magnitude)) * 3.828e26 R: 10^(0.4*(4.42 - R-band magnitude)) * 3.828e26 I: 10^(0.4*(4.08 - I-band magnitude)) * 3.828e26 J: 10^(0.4*(3.64 - J-band magnitude)) * 3.828e26 H: 10^(0.4*(3.32 - H-band magnitude)) * 3.828e26 K: 10^(0.4*(3.28 - K-band magnitude)) * 3.828e26   But I'm not sure about these, because I've seen varying figures from varying sources for the magnitude of the sun in various bands.  I'm trying to extract the luminosity values from PARSEC data.  Speaking of PARSEC data, the documentation is rather lacking, so any clue about the following fields?  McoreTP: Sounds like it should be something about core temperature, but the value is usually either 0, or something small like ""0.546""  Mloss: Presumably mass loss, but there's no units!  But I can probably work out the units just by comparing how star masses change over time....  Tau1m: ??? Usually 0.00, but sometimes something small like ""0.06""  Cexcess: ??? Generally ""-1.000"", but sometimes things like ""7.356"".  Note that there's an entirely separate field for Xc, which is clearly carbon mass fraction. "

3664,"""Table of Astronomy's"" depiction of the solar system models","This is going to be a follow up question to my question about the ""Table of Astronomy"" from yesterday, What is this “Table of astronomy” about?.  I wanted to take a close look at the three depiction of the solar system models (left to right):   Fig. 43. Ptolemaic System; Fig. 45: Tychonic System; and Fig. 44: Copernican System; They are is this order in the original resource  I cant figure out what some of the symbols and circles are supposed to mean. I have marked everything im unsure about partially or completly in red.   (From left to right again)  Ptolemaic System:   The ptolemaic system is a geocentric system, meaning it has the Earth as its center. I have identified most of the symbols that mark the orbits, although I'm missing two. Furthermore, the 5 outer most orbits(?) are what I'm unsure about. As far as I understand it, Claudius Ptolemy believed not only that the Earth was the center of the universe (making this a model of the universe and not the solar system) but also, that the stars were laying on the inside of the universesphere. Therefore I can imagine that the innermost ring is just to close of the sphere. But there are still 4 rings left.  In addition to the rings, I cant identify the third (anchorlike) and the fifth symbol.  Tychonic System:    Here again I'm unsure about the two outer rings, and the third, not dotted, orbit around the Sun.  The two innermost orbits are Venus and ?  If the (red)dotted orbit is supposed to be the Earth's orbit around the Sun, then why does the earth have two orbits?   Also, what are the two stars under the Moon?  Copernican System:   This one is rather straight forward. I'd like to know which of Saturn's moon's orbits this illustration depicts and if my guesses on Jupiters moons are correct.  And at last, what are the 4 marks, A, B, C and D for?  I hope you can help me! Thanks "
3665,Stability of orbital resonance,"Recently I've become more interested in the topic of the stability of planetary systems. I have been reading about it and it seems that orbital resonances play an important role in the stability of Solar System (as well as in the moons of Jupiter and other planets).  I first thought that the orbital resonance is somehow more stable and thus we have several cases in the Solar System.  But as I kept reading, I found out that in the asteroid belt there were some gaps precisely where the resonances happen, so the resonances are actually instable for asteroids.  I then thought that some resonances are stable while others are instable, but some of the resonances that makes gaps in the asteroid belt are actually present in the Solar System between planets, so I am completely lost.  Why resonances are sometimes stable and sometimes instable? What am I missing? Maybe I am misunderstanding something because it doesn't make sense to me. Any help will be welcome. "

3669,Sun as our Supergiant,"Let's talk about the time when our sun becomes a supergiant. We know that our solar system may get destroyed or it may get affected due the large mass of the supergiant and also due to the large temperature. But somehow let us consider nothing happened to our solar system by luck. It's obvious that life won't be possible on earth anymore(due to the extreme heat), but is there a possibility that, the events that took place during the formation of Earth, may take place in the far off planets? Can life formation take place in some other planet just like it happened in Earth?? "
3670,Accuracy of Laplace Method for determining orbital elements,"Recently I had to implement Laplace method and apply it to 3 observations of Mars (10 days in between two observations). The results were pretty good, with discrepancies with real data well below 5% in most of the orbital elements.  I supposed that Laplace method was very accurate, so I tried to apply it to an asteroid (CASLEO, 5387). The 3 observations were also 10-days spaced but now the results widely diverge from the real orbital elements.  I expected it to be less accurate than in the Mars case since the observations covered less fraction of the orbit, but some of the elements were quite far from expected.  So my question is: What is the accuracy of the Laplace Method? Is it really that sensitive to the distance? "

Note: So far I have found the following:   Land et. al (2008): ""Determining the rotation direction in this way is accurate for 96% of galaxies (Pasha &amp; Smirnov 1982)"" Pasha &amp; Smirnov (1982) Buta et al. (2003)    Do you know of any newer publication on this question? More recent than Pasha &amp; Smirnov (1982) where the sample is quite small? "
3673,What is the temperature inside a Black Hole?," Is it insanely hot? Cause of so much gravity? Is it close to absolute zero? Cause the matter is so closely packed, there is hardly any space for particles to move? Is it room temperature? Cause Cooper didn't die in Interstellar when he went into a Black Hole?  "
3674,What is the average Ni-Fe crystal length in iron meteorites?,"Iron-core meteorites display an awesome criss-cross pattern known as the Widmanstätten pattern, shown below:   (photo by Dr. Patrick M. Len, taken from Wikipedia)  I TA for an intro-level astronomy/planetary science class, and today we discussed meteorites. A student asked me what the average length of these crystals is for iron meteorites, but I hesitated. The samples we had available (and the image above) made it look like the average length was on the order of a centimeter, but with great variation. I'm curious as to whether there is a more quantitative answer.   My question:  How long is the average length of a given linear crystal in a typical iron meteorite? How much variation is there from sample to sample?  "
3675,What would it take to capture a passing asteroid or other celestial body into Earth's orbit?,"Every once in a while, we have a celestial body that passes through our solar system.

3678,The dominance of Gravity vs Strength and its dependency on crater size,"So I am trying to write a research paper (about 3700 words) for high school about the topic ""The dominance of Gravity vs Strength and its dependency on crater size"" or something similar.   I have found the following information which I am struggling to understand and has been holding me back from continuing the research : (Can someone explain what dominance is and how can I approach reading more about this topic?)   Making a crater requires both material strength of the target and gravity to be overcome.  which of these dominates depends on the size of the crater    [tex]  Where Y is the yield strength, &rho; is density of the target material, d is the crater's depth and D is its diameter.   A related graph to this topic is this (Holsapple 1993) :     So please, can someone explain what all this means in simple terms ? "

3680,"After Oumuamua passage, has an ""urgency"" telescope time request procedure been set up?","During the rapid passing of ʻOumuamua through our solar system, it was difficult to get instant telescope time. Usually, formal requests and a review process are necessary before telescope time is provided to a particular project.  Now everybody is excited and eager to observe more interstellar objects. Did ""they"" set up an appropriate request procedure for immediate telescope usage for that matter? Or can one expect that similar hurdles and paperwork are required when the next such object is discovered?  Is there any kind of international standard, or are such requests managed individually by each observatory? "
3681,Can dark energy or dark matter affect black holes,I was wondering if black holes are the greatest force of gravity how does other highly spoken about concepts such as dark energy or dark matter compare. Can a black hole absorb dark energy or dark matter? I though dark matter held galaxies together. If a black hole could absorb the dark matter would that be a problem: i.e. the universe getting smaller? 
3682,Why do we use filters in telescopes for astronomical imaging?,I have read that if we image without a filter we get no information about the color or SED of objects.  Can anyone elaborate the reasons for using filters for imaging/photometry?  What happens if we image without a filter?

3684,Has star KIC 8462852's 3 year long Kepler-fading continued after the primary Kepler mission ended?,"BACKGROUND  May 11, 2013 the Kepler space telescope ended its primary mission. Data captured until then showed that the now famous ""Tabby's star"" or ""Boyajian's star"" (KIC 8462852) had been fading throughout the Kepler mission by about 3% cumulatively. (This independently of other reports of brief very deep dimmings and restorations during the mission.)  QUESTION  Today when I post this question, about as much time has passed by since the primary Kepler mission ended, as that mission lasted. So this makes me wonder if other telescopes have observed, or should've been sensitive enough to have observed, a continuation of such a fading trend for that star? Another 3%.  DISCUSSION  If not, what could the explanation be for why this 3+ year fading trend was suddenly interrupted when the primary Kepler telescope mission was terminated? And how long would it take to determine from ground based observatories whether this particular dimming trend continues or not?   Fig. 5 from the paper by Montet and Simon 2016. "
3685,What constellations touch the 9-degree wide Zodiac?,"Say Barry, could you abuse the answer-your-own-question feature of this site, and answer the following question:  As noted in How many constellations in the Zodiac? the ecliptic itself touches 13 constellations, but the Encylopedia Brittanica defines the Zodiac as ""a belt around the heavens extending 9 [degrees] on either side of the ecliptic"":  [website]The Old Farmer's Almanac for 2014 (and previous years) notes (page 114) that Moon occasionally crosses into 5 ""non-Zodiac"" constellations at times:    So, exactly which constellations are ""in the Zodiac"" if the Zodiac extends 9 degrees on either side of the ecliptic?  And why 9 degrees? I know Venus can be as much as 8.25 degrees from the ecliptic, "

3687,Apparent Magnitude / Apparent Brightness relationship help,"I'm a high-school student that is currently working on a project that describes, using mathematical notation and explanation, how scientists can find the values of each of the properties of stars, such as Luminosity, Temperature and Mass. Currently, I'm struggling with finding the equation for the apparent brightness and apparent magnitude of a star. I have stumbled across something called the ""Pogson relation"", but need help it a couple of things.    I found the description of how to use it in another post:     The easiest way to determine the magnitude of a given star is probably to use the Pogson relation. The idea is to determine the magnitude of a star knowing the magnitude of a reference star; it is thus quite easy, using a well-known reference as Vega or Sirius.      The Pogson relation is given by:      [tex]      where [tex] and [tex] are the magnitudes of star 1 and star 2 (your reference star), and [tex] and [tex] brightness   Firstly, is there any version of this equation which doesn't have a comparison between two stars, but rather a direct relation so that given [tex], I can find [tex] of the star?  Secondly, if not, then what I had trouble with was the 'well-known reference' part of the explanation. It said that I use a value for [tex] that is known. However, after researching for the value of the apparent brightness, or its other name flux, for both Sirius and Vega, I have come up empty-handed. Is there a place that I can find this? I've looked at Wikipedia, even consulted the Gaia database, but in the field, there was nothing, just the apparent magnitude.  Lastly, is there any way to directly measure the apparent magnitude of a star with a scientific instrument, like how a CCD camera is used to measure the apparent brightness?  Thank you.  "
3688,"Could a ""burping"" supermassive black hole be responsible for a spiral galaxy's look?","I read an article which suggests black holes could influence the production of stars in the galaxy as the black hole can burst out powerful X-rays to ""snowplow"" the surrounding dust and gas.  Although the article didn't suggest that spiral galaxies are made this way, I like to think that a supermassive black hole that ""burps"" lies in the core of every spiral galaxies. Am I mistaken?  Complementary question: does the supermassive black holes inside the Milky Way still ""burp"" or it is already cured? "
3689,Surface conditions of lonely (rogue) planets,The question How are rogue planets discovered? describes the difficulties in finding planets (or planet-sized objects) that are floating through space without being under the influence of any star or Galaxy system.

3690,Exercise: 2D orbital mechanics simulation (python),"Just a little disclaimer beforehand: I have never studied astronomy or any exact sciences for that matter (not even IT), so I am trying to fill this gap by self-education. Astronomy is one of the areas that has captured my attention and my idea of self-education is head on applied approach. So, straight to the point - this is orbital simulation model that I am casually working on when I have time/mood. My major goal is to create complete solar system in motion and ability to plan spacecraft launches to other planets.  You are all free to pick this project up at any point and have fun experimenting!  update!!! (Nov10)   velocity is now proper deltaV and giving additional motion now calculates sum vector of velocity  you can place as many static objects as you like, on every time unit object in motion checks for gravity vectors from all sources (and checks for collision) greatly improved the performance of calculations a fix to account for interactive mod in matplotlib. Looks like that this is default option only for ipython. Regular python3 requires that statement explicitly.    Basically it is now possible to ""launch"" a spacecraft from the surface of the Earth and plot a mission to the Moon by making deltaV vector corrections via giveMotion(). Next in line is trying to implement global time variable to enable simultaneous motion e.g. Moon orbits Earth while spacecraft tries out a gravity assist maneuver.

Giving object some deltaV such as Craft.giveMotion(deltaV=8500.0, motionDirection=100, time=130000) obviously it requires Craft = Object(...) to be created in the first place as mentioned in previous point. Parameters here are deltaV in m/s (note that for now acceleration is instantaneous), motionDirection is direction of deltaV in degrees (from current position imagine 360 degree circle around object, so direction is a point on that circle) and finally parameter time is how many seconds after the deltaV push trajectory of the object will be monitored. Subsequent giveMotion() start off from last position of previous giveMotion().    Questions:   Is this a valid algorithm to calculate orbits? What are the obvious improvements to be made? I have been considering ""timeScale"" variable that will optimize calculations, as it might not be necessary to recalculate vectors and positions for every second. Any thoughts on how it should be implemented or is it generally a good idea? (loss of accuracy vs improved performance)   Basically my aim is to start a discussion on the topic and see where it leads. And, if possible, learn (or even better - teach) something new and interesting.  Feel free to experiment!  Try using:  Earth = Object(name=""Earth"", position=(50.0, 100.0), radius=6.371, mass=5.972e24) Moon = Object(name=""Moon"", position=(434.0, 100.0), radius=1.737, mass = 7.347e22) Craft = Object(name=""SpaceCraft"", position=(43.0, 100.0), radius=1, mass=1.0e4)  Craft.giveMotion(deltaV=10575.0, motionDirection=180, time=322000) Craft.giveMotion(deltaV=400.0, motionDirection=180, time=50000)   With two burns - one prograde at Earth orbit and one retrograde at Moon orbit I achieved stable Moon orbit. Are these close to theoreticaly expected values?  Suggested exercise: Try it in 3 burns - stable Earth orbit from Earth surface, prograde burn to reach Moon, retrograde burn to stabilize orbit around Moon. Then try to minimize deltaV.   Note: I plan to update the code with extensive comments for those not familiar with python3 syntax.  "
3691,Why isn't everything yellow(ish)?,"I understand that - although appearing yellow - the sun is white. And that this is because the other light colours are scattered by the atmosphere. For example:  Google image search for ""The Sun from Space""  That was difficult for me to come to terms with.  But if yellow light is what's getting through the atmosphere - why doesn't everything have a yellow tinge to it? "
3692,View from inside the black hole,"If an observer is falling toward a black hole with its face away from singularity then what will he observe after crossing the event horizon? The reason that why I am asking this question because as far as I know for an outside observer, the falling observer appear to freeze at event horizon i.e. time appear to stop for falling observer. So if the falling observer is able to look outward after crossing event horizon then he will be able to see an infinite amount of time which is impossible. So what will the observer see after crossing the event horizon? "
3693,Is it possible to tell the time of day by shadows on the photo,"I have a photo where objects and their shadows (e.g. trees, people) are visible, the Sun is not visible directly, but it is clearly neither dusk nor dawn.  Let's assume that coordinates of this place are known more or less precisely so that I can find it on google maps.  I also know the date when this photo was taken but don't know the time of day. Is it possible to estimate it from the photo?  I have a debate with a friend of mine about this. My friend states that a reasonable enough estimate is to calculate the Sun's elevation above the horizon by  $$ \text{elevation} = \arctan \frac{\text{object's height}}{\text{shadow's length}} $$  and then use one the myriad websites on the internets to look up the time for that date and location.  I doubt it because   The length of a shadow on the photograph depends on the relative position of the Sun, the object and the camera. Most importantly, the slope of the ground can't be estimated neither from the photo, nor from google maps. This picture is a good example.   Who's right? Am I missing something?  Also, it would be interesting to understand the role of uncertainties in this calculation. Assuming that the surface is reasonably smooth and the slope is close to zero, what uncertainties (location, object's height, shadow's length, the slope, camera position) would play the major role? Does it depend on the time of year? "
3694,Apollo 11 Under Different conditions,"  Howdy, this might be an odd question, but I'm using whatever information I gather here to help write an alternate universe version of the 1950s through 1980s. Due to some convoluted plot contrivance involving several delays to the moon landing, the very last pass behind the moon the Apollo crew takes place during a lunar eclipse. Now, I unfortunately don't have access to any simulation software, so I'm not sure what that would look like to them! How much of the lunar surface would the crew be able to see in passes that occur beforehand, and what does the phenomenon look like from space? Do we know what it might look like? Time is not of the essence, but I still need to know these details before writing this particular section of the story. "

3696,How can the Kuiper belt coexist with the 9th planet?,"There are asteroid belts, and there are collections of bodies in resonant orbits, such as Trojans. Aren't these separate things?  The recent evidence for the 9th planet is an alignment in various parameters of known Kuiper belt objects. Conversely, few or no objects are known in the parts of the belt that would be swept away by the hypothetical planet.  If the Kuiper belt straddles the gravitational neighborhoods of Neptune and this other planet, and its populations reflect their influence, is it really a belt at all? A lopsided belt? Or just a region with a collection of distinct populations, each associated with a dominant body? "
3697,Could the Earth be used to cast an arago/poisson spot on something,"There's a potential design for a space-based telescope that uses a large opaque circular disk in place of a transparent lens to focus light for analysis. It uses the light that bends around the disk that focuses on the Poisson or Arago spot, but requires a circular object. It could theoretically produce much clearer images (1000x) than telescopes we have today, albeit with a narrower field of vision.  I understand that the Earth is not perfectly round, but I believe I've also heard it's very ""smooth"" despite mountains and such, so I wonder if instead of a spot (very small circle) on some point behind it, it might cast an oval or other oblong shape of some size that, using lenses or computer reconstruction, might produce an image that is usable, and presumably even higher resolution (millions, billions, trillions, or even more times as detailed?).  If that's not possible, what are the issues? Does the atmosphere get in the way? If we could imagine a sufficiently circular disk roughly the size of Earth, about how far would the image processing receiver have to be from the disk opposite the studied object in order to capture the convergence of bent light? Would the gravity of the Earth affect the distance at all, due to gravitational lensing? "
3698,Why does this graph for sunlight intensity on land has a steeper slope during sunrise as compared to sunset?,I got this image while checking weather data for a city in North India using  Mathematica's Wolfram Alpha query    I noticed one feature in the graph which i could not explain . Why does the encircled part 'A' which denotes  sunrise has slightly higher slope as compared to encircled part 'B' which denotes sunset !   I also checked the graph for summer month and the pattern was exactly opposite   Summer Month    Am i interpreting the data wrong or is it so that sun achieves its highest intensity during the day faster in winter months than in summers ? What could be the reason behind this ?  
3699,Why is Saturn invisible in this radar image of its rings?,"The image below is from Radar imaging of Saturn’s rings Nicholson, P. D. et al., Icarus 177 (2005) 32–62, doi:10.1016/j.icarus.2005.03.023 and discussed further in this answer to How did Arecibo detect methane lakes on Titan, and image Saturn's rings?  I believe I can see Saturn's radar ""shadow"" blocking the furthest parts of the ring near the top of the images, but I can not see any reflections from Saturn itself.  The paper addresses a possible signal from the planet itself in Section 3.2. Ring images:     Echoes at low Doppler shifts might be expected to arise either from near the subradar point on the planet itself or from ring material far outside the main rings. Our images show no evidence for any echo from the subradar point on Saturn, which would appear near ν = 0 and τ = −2RS/c = −402 ms.    The same answer describes radar measurements of Saturn's moon Titan as well.  It might be possible to make a hand-waving argument that Saturn itself is invisible because it's ""just gas"" but according to ESA's Saturn's atmosphere     The top visible cloud deck, made of ammonia clouds, is found at about 100 kilometres below the top of the troposhere (tropopause), where the temperature is about -250°C.      The second cloud deck, made of ammonium hydrosulphide clouds, is found at about 170 kilometres below the tropopause, where the temperature is -70°C.      The lowest cloud deck, made of water clouds, is found at about 130 kilometres below the tropopause, where the temperature is about 0°C (freezing point of water).   So I'm thinking that the various clouds of different colors and compositions will contain droplets or particles, rather than just be regions of different gas composition.  Why then does there seem to be nowhere near as much radar return from the planet as there is from the rings?   "
3700,What type of planetary-mass object would Planet Nine be?,"Given that Planet Nine is hypothesized to be 10-20 times the mass of the Earth orbiting the sun some 200-2500 AU out, what kind of planetary-mass object would it be?  Even given that it has apparently ""influenced"" several Trans-Neptunian objects, since its orbit is so large and so slow (approximately 25,000 years) it would take an awful long time to clear out its own orbit (especially given that we do not know how long it has been in that orbit), so it seems like it would not qualify as an actual planet under the rules that re-classified Pluto.  Since it orbits our sun, it wouldn't be an exoplanet nor a rogue planet.  And it sure seems too big to be called a dwarf planet.  A captured planet seems closest in other attributes, but it probably was not either a capture nor a re-capture, but more likely a partial ejection.  So what classification would it fall into? "
3701,"If sun steals comets from other stars, then what is the primary source of comets?","I heard some theory that sun may steal materials such as comets from neighbouring stars, is it true? But if is true, what is the primary source of those comets? Especially ""who"" creates them instead of steals them? And which stars are ""willing"" to bear our sun steals materials from it? "
3702,Do planets migrate suddenly or gradually?,"Current models of the configurations of the planets conclude that Neptune once migrated outwards. AFAIK this refurbishment came about by Jupiter and Saturn gradually getting into and leaving a gravitational resonance.  Did Neptune (and possibly a fifth giant planet) redirect itself in a sudden encounter event, like comet 67P Churyumov–Gerasimenko did in 1959, halving the perihelion of its orbit since then? Or did it happen gradually over maybe millions of years? Is planetary migration in general sudden or gradual? Is it a matter of a single encounter event, or an adaptation to a changing gravity landscape? "
3703,"How does time ""add up"" for observers outside of and travelers inside of a Krasnikov tube?","A ship travels 99% of c from Earth (leaving at Time A, say 2016) to Destination Star (arriving at Time B, say 2020, accounting for relativistic effects) to stretch the tube, leaves a buoy at Destination Star, then uses the tube's topology to return to Earth, effectively faster-than-light, moments after it left, according to how the Krasnikov tube is supposed to work (Time A plus a few minutes). Can the ship now return to Time B (2020) from ""Time A (2016) plus a few minutes"" using the tube just as quickly? If so, would its return to Time B mean ""Destination Star in the ship's year 2020, the moment when it arrived / first stretched the tube to this destination?"" And if so, would it mean returning to the system ""before"" the ship dropped the buoy? My understanding of a Krasnikov tube is that it's a theoretical means for FTL travel that doesn't violate causality, because a ship traveling along the return path of a tube ""rolls back"" time to just moments before the ship originally left.  Now, I understand that there is a way to construct a return tube that would violate causality ([website]The questions I have then are:  A) Am I even thinking about this correctly? Where have I messed up?  B) I don't understand how a system of Krasnikov tubes, as some sources suggest, could be used to create an interstellar network for FTL travel. It seems to me that the traveler in the ship can never actually have an impact on his exit or return points, since he will always be returning to Time A (2016) moments after he left, or Time B (2020), the moment he arrives?

3705,What weather is present in Jupiter's great red spot?,"What weather is present in Jupiter's great red spot?  Is it raining?  Is it snowing?  There is definitely a hurricane a blowing :-).  I know it is very cold, extremely high winds, has clouds of an orange / red color, and there is probably lightning.  I also know the gravity on Jupiter is strong, about 2.5x that of Earth.  Here is a similar question / answer that answers some of what I am looking for, but I still want to know if it is raining / snowing, etc... What Would it Look Like Inside Jupiter&#39;s Great Red Spot?  I am making a level for Planetary Settlers that takes place in an air base trapped in the cloud tops of the Great Red Spot, and here is what I envision the red spot looking like so far (I am still working on adding the lightning): YouTube video of Jupiter Level Development.  I would like to know if I should add rain, snow, or any other unusual phenomenon present there.   "
3706,Energetics of Titans Tholin haze,"So, I've googled and wiki'd on this, but no clue, so I turn my question to the community:  Given Titan's nice orange haze that is supposedly composed of Tholins and strangely coincides with its stratosphere (taken from wikipedia)    I got to think whether the haze takes the role of clouds on earth when it comes to energetics. From this a bunch of questions arose:   Do we know whether the haze is responsible for heat trapping and thus, the formation of a stratosphere on Titan? What about radiation transport modelling with those particles, is this successful? Also I'd be interested in what we know about the stability of Tholins. Could they survive harsh irradiation that atmospheres on Hot Jupiters do encounter?   I would like to be able to make a statement such as ""Dust"" or ""Haze-controlled"" energetics for the stratosphere of Titan, if this is so. It would be nice if you helped to clear this up. "
3707,Why is the Sun's Luminosity not equal to the Zero Point Luminosity?,"I was doing some research and found that the zero-point luminosity was [tex], while the sun's reported luminosity was [tex], according to Wikipedia. Why isn't it the same value? Doesn't the symbol [tex] represent the value of our sun?    Furthermore, when Googling the Luminosity of the sun, it gives [tex], which suggests that [tex] when it is evidently not. What's going on here? I'm very confused.  For background, I have little to no background knowledge of astrophysics, and I'm trying to learn about it.  Thanks. "

3709,Questions about Planck’s law,"Two questions:   I read online that all objects emit the majority of their thermal radiation in the radio, and that this emission increases with temperature. Does this mean that all glowing bodies emit the majority of their radiation in the radio, regardless of their temperature? Wien’s law is used to find the peak wavelength of a black body. Does this mean that there is zero emission at any wavelength shorter than this peak wavelength?   Thank you in advance for your help.  "
3710,"""Official"" time for other planets","I want to make clock that shows current time on different solar bodies. For that I need to know how to count time on those planets. Is there any official definition of times on other planets in our solar system? Brief google search did not help.  I am capable of implementing library for this myself but I wonder about current state of the art of time telling on other planets. So basically I want to know these things:   Is there any official time standard? If so, where can I find it? If not, how should I approach this problem? Should I make something like Unix epoch at some time in the past for every planet?   Thanks for any tips.  EDIT: Ok, so on Mars, seconds, minutes and hours were made longer to keep 24-hour day. Is this viable to other planets as well? Venus aside for now :)  I was also thinking about keeping the hours the same, having days as long as many whole hours fits in them plus smaller compensation hours which would have length of (total_minutes_in_solar_day % 60). This concept is from David Weber novels, if you are familiar with them.  EDIT2: Based on discussion in the comments, I'll try to make some basic model that would be if possible applicable to any planetary body (thinking ahead :)). This is obviously not going to have any serious real world application but I would still like it to have some sense.  Thanks for your input, I will leave the question open for some more time if anyone wants to add their opinion. "
3711,Why does Jupiter break comets apart?,"I understand that there are magnificent tidal forces that come with getting too close to Jupiter, but what is causing comets like Shoemaker-Levy to get torn apart?

3712,Calculate Earth's distance travelled in a year,"This is probably more of a math question than astronomy, but I'd like to know the distance the Earth travels in one revolution around the sun (i.e. a year).  According to the data in Wikipedia, I think there may be several ways for me to calculate this but I'm not sure whether they are correct or how to do them:   Calculate by velocity and time: the average velocity is given as [tex] (a suspiciously round number; imprecise?) and one revolution takes [tex] days. That gives [tex] Calculate by semi-major axis and eccentricity: my math is too weak for that. I searched the web and didn't find a solution for that (calculating the circumference of an ellipse exactly seems to be a problem?) Any other way using the orbital data given in the Wikipedia article?   In essence, this can be made into a pretty generic question: How do I calculate the distance an object travels in one revolution using the usual orbital parameters? "
3713,Will JWST be as durable as the hubble telescope?,"JW Space Telescope is designed for a 5-10 year mission duration. Seeing as Hubble and other space missions have paved the way for JWST for reliability issues, It even has zero friction gyro's with 100+ years mean time before failure. Is it reasonable to think that JWST can last longer than Hubble?  JWST will orbit a Lagrange point in earth's shadow and will be 4 times further than the moon, around 10 days of travel away, and NASA states that JWST won't be serviceable. Why?  Why are JWST's fuel limitations so short? Are there no provisions for refueling? even a refueling craft? How many gallons of dinitrogen tetroxide ([tex]) as oxidizer and hydrazine ([tex]) will it contain?  Surely NASA are secretly hoping for a 20 year mission? "
3714,"Assuming no light pollution, was ""2C. 1406"" ever visible to the naked eye?","Joseph Needham, in his Science and Civilisation in China Vol. III, claimed that there was an ancient record of a nova about three thousand years ago. As a result of private correspondences with a ""Dr A. Beer"" (maybe Arthur Beer?), Needham stated in his book that     This supernova position [""position"" being ""next to Antares""] agrees closely with the radio-star 2C. 1406.   Assuming that ""2C. 1406"" refers to an item in the Second Cambridge Catalogue of Radio Sources, the data given for this item (original document here) is      Acknowledging that the Second Catalogue has various problems, my questions are:   Is ""2C. 1406"" (still) considered to be ""IC 4606"" (which, I suppose, refers to this nebula from the SIMBAD Astronomical Database)? If so, was ""IC 4606"" ever visible to the human eye? If not, what do the coordinates given for ""2C. 1406"" currently refer to (if anything), and was this ever visible to the naked eye? Or is this not really a radio source, but an error that was fixed by later Catalogues?     Note, the interpretation of the supposed nova record is extremely controversial, so I wouldn't be surprised if the text didn't refer to any kind of astronomical observation at all. "
3715,time on earth compared to completely stationary in space,"I recently started trying to understand the theory of relativity and I have the following question.  Because earth is orbiting the sun at approx 67,000 mph (and its my understanding time slows down the faster you are moving) what are the effect of time on earth compared to a completely stationary observer watching earth's orbit, from outer space?  How would the twin paradox work with one twin on earth and the other twin completely stationary in outer space? "
3716,"Did Earth ""tilt"" seasonally before it was accepted that the world was not flat?","Before it was widely accepted that the Earth was round, how did astronomers describe the yearly movement of the sun to south in the Northern Winter that produced the seasons?

3720,Why would discovering life on another planet be important/matter to us?,"I had a funny thought, and would like to pose it to you:  When I was a kid, reading any kind of astronomy or similar books would all say that there was no other life in the universe, and made it pretty clear that anyone thinking there could be was probably off his rocker.   Nowadays, it seems this has become a very important question for astronomers and other scientists, a new deep-seated belief that must now be proven. Some seem to think it would be the most important discovery of all time.   I'm wondering why?  My guess is, if we did 'discover' life on another planet, it'll make the news for a bit, and then the average person will go back to their every day life without much more thought about it.   For me, I would think this is great, only insofar as it means a possible new source of food (i.e., some delicious exotic cuisine assuming it's edible, and possibly even some place to go conquer and colonize if there was any profitability/money in doing so).   For some scientists, though, I get the sense it's more of an axe to grind with the long-dreary he-said she-said argument of science vs. religion.   Why do you think it would matter?  My question assumes any life discovered is probably not going to be very 'interesting' life, at least nothing we're going to have a conversation with. "
3721,On the consistency of different well-polished astronomy software,"I have purchased a custom wedding band from a seller that claims the ring will show the constellations visible at the horizon on a specific date at a certain date and time.   However, I have fired up Stellarium and set it up to look at a specific example shown in the product page - and I cannot find any set of parameters which looks like it: Jupiter's not in the right place, some constellations are under the horizon (Virgo, Libra, Leo), some others very high in the sky (Andromeda, Perseus)... Although it's the first time I use Stellarium, I don't see how I could make a mistake:   Location set to London Bridge (even the preset London to be sure) Date and time set just like in the example (double-checked 5 times) Cylindrical projection (tried all of them though), offset -30% FoV 210° (to have the 360° mapped to the entire screen - I have absolutely no idea why 180° does not work) Elevation lines horizontal (although I tried moving around to align everything like in the pictures for every projection method - in vain)   Here is the example:   Am I missing something, or is their sky map wrong? If yes, is it possible that two pieces of well-polished software like Stellarium and this one (looks just as good as Stellarium) have different star locations? How come (isn't there a standard star almanach?)? "
3722,Variable Types of Stars,"I'm trying to decode the Variable Types of stars in the Hipparcos Library.

What does the colon signify?  Edited - So on line, 2575 of hip_va_1.dat, the following line has a Variable Type of EA/AR, what does the slash signify.  112009| |F5V         |P|EA/AR | | 9.016| | 9.65 |  -1.7|   2.96850  |  -4.1|8501.4698|4|A| |W_Gru       |   2.96850|2430132.15| 9.40|10.00|P|R   What does the (+) sign signify in a Variable Type e.g. SR+ZA (HIP36623)  I really like to understand what the significance of the +, / and : mean  "
3723,What is the meaning of ellipticity of a galaxy being more than 1?,"I was recently doing a project on calculating ellipticities of galaxies using SDSS data. I downloaded the stokes parameter values (q and u) from data  [tex]  and for few values of stokes parameters, the value of ellipticity goes above 1.   What could this possibly mean? Could this mean the data of random galaxies I've taken has irregular agalaxies in it and that's the reason for ellipticity being greater than 1? I would like to hear your opinions and answers. "
3724,What characteristics or patterns do galaxies have on color-luminosity chart?,"For the following graph, I have some confusions:   How do galaxies rank by mass? We know that on main-sequence, more luminous stars are also more massive, so I guess it also applies to galaxies. Do red sequence galaxies split into blue galaxies, or do blue galaxies merge into bigger red galaxies? Can galaxies ever be born as red sequence members? I doubt it because all galaxies should start from blue. But I am not 100% sure. Do red sequence galaxies tend to become redder over time? Do large galaxies use up star forming gas more rapidly than smaller galaxies?    "

3727,Doing Correct Calculations with Binary Star Systems,"I've been experimenting with Binary Star System calculations but came across some issues.  I can correctly calculate the Semi-Major Axis of the Earth's orbit around the Sun by doing the equation:    Using data from Wikipedia.   a = (1.521e11 + 1.47095e11) / 2.   &lt;- average radius of Earth's orbit (meters) μ = G * M = 6.67408e(-11) * 1.98847e30 gravitational constant * Mass of Sun (kg)   I got ≈ 31557884 seconds which equates to ≈ a year  Now my issue is that I've been searching around for a formula that calculates the period and etc of a Binary System where two masses (such as stars) orbit around each other.  So then I try essentially the same formula, this:    I used data from the Procyon A and B (binary system)  a = Semi-Major Axis = 4.3 AU M1 = Procyon A Mass = 1.499 Solar Masses M2 = Procyon B Mass = 0.602 Solar Masses   these give me a T (period) of 4731227.

3728,How would astronomical seeing on Mars differ from that on Earth?,"Astronomical seeing is the limiting factor for the resolution of all but the smallest Earthbound telescopes.    Source  Stunning advances in adaptive optics (along with it's predecessor speckle interferometry and it's budget-minded cousin lucky imaging) get around this but only with substantial compromises in (some combination of) throughput, cost, complexity and wavelength range (see answers to Why aren't ground-based observatories using adaptive optics for visible wavelengths?)  If identical telescopes sat on the surface of Earth and Mars and looked at a distant and equi-distant  body, how would the following differ between the Mars telescope and the Earth telescope?:   Angular scale for the blurring, or [tex]  Time scale for the blurring, or [tex]  Aperture diameter where seeing starts to dominate over diffraction   caveats: The answer wouldn't have to use [tex] and [tex] if there is another way to address the angular and temporal differences between the astronomical seeing two observing sites. Both Mars and Earth have significant topography, but both have a ""sea level"" or reference 0 altitude, let's go with that.  edit: I've added a bounty, and if you would like to quantitatively compare to Maunakea or Atacama at 4.2 or 2.6 km to similar and similarly difficult-to-reach elevations on Mars, that's fine. But at an astounding 25 km, Olympus Mons on Mars has no remotely comparable site on Earth. "
3729,Has celestial navigation been materially impacted by the imperfect nature of celestial reference frames over time?,"In this video on inertial reference frames, it is mentioned that the stars are humanity's best inertial reference frame: the earth experiences a subtle acceleration relative to the sun due to the earth's own orbit and rotation; therefore the earth is only roughly an inertial frame. But, the stars are relatively fixed, they say.  However, the stars in galaxies move relative to each other--I assume many with some sort of rotational velocity and therefore acceleration--and galaxies themselves are all slowly moving away from one another, perhaps even with centrifugal acceleration of their own.  Has this acceleration been great enough that humanity has needed to update navigational tools that rely on the assumption that stars are an inertial reference frame?  Is it possible that every observable object in the universe is in fact accelerating relative to an unobservable reference frame? "
3730,In astronomy Is there a name for the exact time between solar noon and sunset?,"Like there are names for various events such as sunset, sunrise, solar noon, solar midnight, astro, nautical and civil twilight, what exactly is name for time between sunset and solar noon. Afternoon it is but what exactly between these two points? Is golden hour the only subcategory for the afternoon?   I did come across the word midafternoon. similarly, midnight, midmorning and midevening. but then again midafternoon would mean 3 o clock or does it mean point between solar noon and sunset? because midnight in general is more acceptable as 12 o clock. is it? "
3731,Orbital Resonance,"First, let me verify that this statement is correct:  Planets will tend to migrate toward stable orbital resonances with other planets around the host star. There are unstable resonances, also, where two or more resonances are very close together, and there will be gaps in these orbital distances like in our asteroid belt. Planets with more elliptical orbits will tend to migrate in this way faster than those with more circular ones.  My question is: Is there mathematics that backs this up or just computer modeling? I suppose this is a multi-body problem that can only be solved with computer iteration, but are there basic mathematical principals to suggest this would happen? "

3733,Formulae for gravitatitional equilibrium,"I am trying to calculate at which point gravitational equilibrium sets in for various bodies (planets stars neutron stars etc.) assuming they are perfect spheres. However, the radius I get is not equal to what it should be according to Wikipedia (I tried it for the Sun, a planet and a neutron star, but all of them were off by quite a bit).  Below is the example of the neutron star radius I'm trying to get:  My result (factor) is 1 at:  Radius: [tex]  Density: [tex]  The Wikipedia article about neutron stars says the radius of a neutron star is about 12 km and the density is about 10 times higher than mine. My result is 2228km, which is quite a bit off, so I have a second question:   Am I calculating all the forces I need? Are the formulae I'm using correct?   I took them from Wikipedia and university slides and I found multiple variations of almost all of them (most of which I actually didn't list below), so I'm quite confused as to what is correct.  I know that I'm using iron as the element and I should split it up and convert the protons to neutrons, but that would only increase the degeneracy pressure and result in an even bigger radius, if I'm not mistaken.  Here's how I calculated it:    Mass of an electron: [tex]  Standard atomic weight of hydrogen: [tex]  Mass of a neutron: [tex]      Atomic mass of [tex]: [tex]  Number of atoms: [tex]  Number of neutrons per atom: [tex]  Number of electrons per atom: [tex]  Total number of particles: [tex]  Mass: [tex]  Radius: [tex]  Temperature: [tex]  Force of gravity: [tex]  Volume: [tex]  Particle density: [tex]  a: [tex]  Radiation pressure: [tex]  Gas pressure: [tex]  Electron degeneracy pressure: [tex]  Electron degeneracy pressure 2: [tex]  Neutron degeneracy pressure: [tex]       Neutron degeneracy pressure 2: [tex]  Total pressure: [tex]  Total pressure force: [tex]  If total pressure force = force of gravity, then the body is in equilibrium.

3734,Is the Big Bang inflation caused by Dark Energy,"The rate of expansion of the universe after the Big Bang is described as Inflation. It is stated as being initially very fast then slowed. But the expansion is still continuing.  Some say expansion is currently powered by Dark Energy. The equations unlike gravity say that the rate appears to be linearly proportional to distance, like Hooke's Law for springs. Initially the universe was very small, so if the spring constant is dependent on the size of the universe, could this explain the inflation? What experiment could be devised to test this? "
3735,Why do PMS stars on the Hayashi track remain at a constant temperature while they contract?,"Why do pre-main-sequence stars on the Hayashi track remain at a constant temperature while they contract?  I've read the Wikipedia article, so no need to repeat the derivation.  What I took away from that is that the extra heat generated by contraction is given off almost exactly because the whole star is convective and the atmosphere is very capable of radiating that heat away if the opacity is mainly caused by hydrogen ions, which is the case in the cooler of the pre-main-sequence stars.  Is that correct? "
3736,If the earth stopped spinning what would happen to the moon,"A question was posed at work today, ""if the earth stopped spinning what would happen to the moon""? Ignoring any effects on the Earth, what actually happens to the Moon? Does it continue to orbit the now non-rotating Earth, or does it fly off into space like a massive asteroid, or more likely some other thing that I can't conceive of?   Note, the Earth stops spinning, not orbiting the sun.   For additional curiosity, what would be the differences if this were an extremely gradual slowing vs an almost instantaneous stoppage? "

3738,How long should it take for us to observationally determine if Caltech's Planet Nine is really there?,Caltech just released a report that says there is possibly a large (10 earth mass) planet in a remote orbit (10 - 20 thousand year) that explains a lot of observations of Kuiper Belt objects. How long could it take for this to be confirmed or refuted observationally?  See this video  
3739,Snowball Earth brightness,"The Earth likely froze over almost completely about 700 million years ago. This increased its albedo significantly, and I wonder if that would have a considerable effect on its apparent magnitude from other planets. (The Sun was like 4% fainter, though.)  If so, would the Earth be naked-eye visible from farther away 700 mya than it is now? Maybe from Uranus's moons? "
3740,Is gravity a source of infinite energy at a cosmological scale,"As I understand it, gravity cannot be attenuated by any medium (in the way that EM radiation can be, for instance).  Does this, then, not make it a source (theoretically, I am not talking of practicalities) of infinite energy - if we assume the universe itself is infinite and looks the same everywhere (ie there are objects with mass everywhere)?  Or is it more correct to say that gravity has a net contribution of nothing to the universe's energy density because the attractional energy is balanced by a negative potential energy? "

For now I'm just increasing the mean anomaly over time without taking the period in account.  The problem is that the planets do not seem to get the correct offset to the ecliptic, and their movement is really weird: they speed up, then slow down and reverse in their paths. Here is a video of their movement: [website]It looks like the eccentricity is correct on their ellipses and the distances to the sun are also correct, but the rest is just wrong. I'm not that great at math or astronomy to fully understand what's going on in this algorithm, but I'm hoping someone here might spot the error.  using UnityEngine; using System;  public class Orbit : MonoBehaviour  { public float longitudeOfTheAscendingNode; public float inclination; public float argumentOfPerihelion; public float semimajorAxis; public float eccentricity;  public float meanAnomalySpeed = 0.1f;  float M = 0; //mean anomaly  void Update() {     SetPosition(); }  void SetPosition() {     float N = longitudeOfTheAscendingNode;     float i = inclination;     float w = argumentOfPerihelion;     float a = semimajorAxis;     float e = eccentricity;      float E = M + e * (180 / Mathf.PI) * Mathf.Sin(M) * (1 + e * Mathf.Cos(M));      float xv = a * (Mathf.Cos(E) - e);     float yv = a * (Mathf.Sqrt(1 - e * e) * Mathf.Sin(E));      float v = Mathf.Atan2(yv, xv);     float r = Mathf.Sqrt(xv * xv + yv * yv);      float xx = r * (Mathf.Cos(N) * Mathf.Cos(v + w) - Mathf.Sin(N) * Mathf.Sin(v + w) * Mathf.Cos(i));     float yy = r * (Mathf.Sin(N) * Mathf.Cos(v + w) + Mathf.Cos(N) * Mathf.Sin(v + w) * Mathf.Cos(i));     float zz = r * (Mathf.Sin(v + w) * Mathf.Sin(i));      transform.position = new Vector3(xx, yy, zz);      M += meanAnomalySpeed * Time.deltaTime;     if (M &gt; 360)         M -= 360; }   } "
3742,We are sure that there are no brown dwarfs closer than ______,"I don't quite know how to word this question.  How close could a brown dwarf be to us and have gone undetected until now?  Or maybe, with what probability are we sure that there is no brown dwarf within X light years of the sun? (For different values of X)  (Don't worry about addressing Nemesis or a hypothetical binary partner for the sun. I'm just asking about undetected brown dwarfs..., even outside of the Oort cloud but within Alpha C. I don't know how sensitive the WISE survey was.) "
3743,Why didn't the Big Bang produce heavier elements?,"Shortly after the Big Bang, temperatures cooled from the Planck temperature. Once temperatures lowered to 116 gigakelvins, nucleosynthesis took place and helium, lithium and trace amounts of other elements were created.  However, if the temperatures were so high shortly after the Big Bang, why weren't much heavier elements produced? 116 gigakelvins is obviously far above the temperature required for elements like carbon and oxygen to fuse. In addition, shouldn't most of the protons at those temperatures have fused, leaving the Universe with mostly heavier elements? "
3744,What good evidence exists for the 9th planet as spoken of by Caltech?,"I'm sure Caltech has answered this in some way, but I think it's a good question have on this site.  What good evidence exists for the 9th planet as spoken of by Caltech?  As I see it, Caltech has apparently looked at the orbital parameters of many Trans-Neptunian-Objects (TNOs) and noticed that the lines between their perihilion and aphelion (i don't know what the technical term might be) all run more or less in the same direction. This is evidence that some large body has gravitationally ""synced"" these planets over millions of years.  Except that alone isn't good evidence. Here are two stats first:   Known TNOs: about 1,750 according to the Minor Planet Center's list. Estimated existing Kuiper-Belt Objects: 120,000+ according to Britannica. (That number is only estimating objects of 100-km diameter or more, but that's fine for our purposes.) Note: 120,000 is only for KBOs. There are other TNO sets such as the oort cloud (and the scattered disc if you define it separately), so I expect the number to be much much bigger than 120,000.   Given that we've only measured about 1% or less of TNO orbits, how can we be sure we have a good random sample to say that a massive body must have aligned these orbits? In other words, all the other orbits might be randomly distributed, which would be compelling evidence that some giant body is not ""syncing"" orbits or else way more than 1% of them would be ""synced"".  If I recall my statistics class correctly, 1% is not good enough for a random sample. The border-line good enough area starts at 3%, but there's still a catch: It has to be a random sample. There are still observation-bias questions here because obviously we've only mostly discovered the ""nearby"" TNOs, because they are easier to discover when they're ""nearby"". That certainly would not be a random sample even if we had 3% of them.  TLDR: There are at least 100,000 distant objects, of which less than 1% of them have some kind of aligned orbit as far as we know today. Is this actually good evidence that something has aligned them?  EDIT: Another analogy that might help. You have a bag of 100 marbles. You reach in and pull out 5 from the top of the bag (notice I didn't say any random 5!). They turn out to be 4 red ones and 1 black one. Is this actually good evidence that about 80% of the whole bag is red? "
3745,"Why does the sun appear 13x bigger through diffraction in Voyager 1 image from 1990, but not from Earth?","The sun in the Voyager 1 photo here from 1990 appears 13x bigger than its diameter, diffraction of course. On Earth, photographs of the sun do not make it appear 13x bigger. Why?  A description of the photo from jpl.nasa.gov,     ""The wide-angle was taken with the camera's darkest filter (a methane   absorption band), and the shortest possible exposure (5 thousandths of   a second) to avoid saturating the camera's vidicon tube with scattered   sunlight. ""    "
3746,View of other planets from the Earth,"There appears to be varying positions/spots of view of other planets from Earth, if I'm not wrong. Now, given that all planets are on the same plane, why do their positions change on the night sky for similar seasons, when they come back to earth's view? How is this possible?  Shouldn't all the outer planets be observed within the horizon's range (and not in the high skies), now that they lie on the earth's tropical plane? Give or take a short distance from where the horizon 'touches' the ground? "
3747,9th planet location?,"I've seen a number of news reports indicating there is likely a 9th planet in our Solar System, something with an orbital period of between 10k-20k years, that is 10 times Earth's mass. I haven't seen any real indication of where this object might be. If I had access to a sufficient telescope, would I be able to find this planet, and what way would I point a telescope to find it? How far is it likely to be, or is that not well known? "
3748,Black hole's gravity,"Is gravity relative to volume, or size of an object?   Since a black hole is a massive star that collapses on its weight, how comes the same sun's mass, when it becomes a black hole, provides gravity that disallows even light to come out of the black hole? Before it was a black hole, the sun had a similar weight to the black hole, since no mass was lost or gained (and particles, including photons, come out of the star). Once it collapses under its weight, does the gravity become more in relation to the size of the object in question (reduction from the huge surface area of a massive star, to a compact/compressed, low surface area black hole), now that the same non-increased or subtracted gravity is bound to a much smaller surface?   Or in other words, what is it that makes everything bound to a black hole, but nothing of the same happens to a sun of similar mass, (and therefore with the same gravitational pull). "
3749,How far from the Sun can an Earth TCO (temporarily captured orbiter) go after leaving?,"Objects which are temporarily captured into an Earth-Moon system orbit (temporarily captured orbiters or TCOs) by definition will leave this orbit. While the term suggest an Earth orbit, it's really an n-body orbit involving the gravitational effects of the Moon and Sun as well.  They are also sometimes referred to as ""mini-moons"".  Upon exiting, can TCOs go as far out as the asteroid belt, or do they then just orbit the Sun in a heliocentric orbit very similar to the Earth's 1 AU?  Has anyone tracked or calculated the orbit of a known TCO to this extent?    As a side question (it can be split this off separately if necessary) have any of these been larger than say 10 meters in diameter? "
3750,Latest cosmological parameters,"I'm looking for the latest values (with uncertainties) of the four main cosmological density parameters [tex] : \begin{align}\tag{1} \Omega_{\text{mat}} &amp;={} ?, &amp;\Omega_{\text{rad}} &amp;={} ?, &amp;\Omega_{\Lambda} &amp;={} ?, &amp;\Omega_{k} &amp;={} ?. \end{align} I know that [tex], [tex], [tex] and [tex], but I would like to have more precise values (with uncertainties, if possible).  Take note that these parameters are constrained by the following relation : \begin{equation}\tag{2} \Omega_{\text{mat}} + \Omega_{\text{rad}} + \Omega_{\Lambda} + \Omega_{k} \equiv 1. \end{equation}  Of course, I checked Wikipedia but I don't trust it very much :  [website]I've also checked on arXiv.

3753,Slow moving star like objects in the night sky,"So yesterday at about 2am I was watching the sky when I saw a small star like object moving very slowly across the sky. My initial thought was that it was a satellite due to the fact it was moving so slowly and wasn’t flashing. However  then I saw another one moving in the same direction about 10 minutes later. I had to keep letting my eyes adjust to the darkness to see it as it was so small but in total, I saw 4 of them moving in very similar directions, almost like they were following a path. There was about a 5-10min gap between each one and I could see it the entire time until it dipped over the tree line. I live in a very rural area so there was no light pollution or anything to interfere with the view. Now I know that around about now we are able to observe the Perseid meteor shower from the comet Swift-Tuttle but these object were very slow moving and I don’t really know how slow a meteor can move, but isn’t it strange that all of them were moving in the same direction? I also did see some normal meteors but as you’d expect, they only lasted for a second or under. Anyone have a clue what’s going on? Thanks. "
3754,"Could space time curve from the vantage point of earth and out into the universe, and would d = 1 / P in that case give false estimates?","The seventeenth century saw a revolution in astronomy. The invention of the telescope and the acknowledgement of the heliocentric system triggered a race amongst astronomers to measure the parallax of stars - the annual displacement of stellar positions due to Earth's motion around the Sun. In the late 1830s these measurements enabled astronomers to determine the distances to a handful of stars for the first time. From the 1850s onwards, the application of photography to astronomical observations transformed the practice of charting the sky, allowing the compilation of larger and larger catalogues of stellar positions and distances.  That robust marvel of trigonometry applied to observations of other stars, lets me look up into the sky for 6 months, measure the apparent motion, then divide 1 by that, and voila, the distance to the star.   For example, the distance to Alpha Centauri, [website]These distances are used in all textbooks, all databases, all conversations, and does not correct for any space-time curvature whatsoever.  To draw a line on the sky, and use trigonometry, seems almost a bit too simple. Anyone have any thoughts on if space-time might curve in weird ways sort of like how a fish eye lens on Instagram distorts an image? "
3755,Planets classification by density,"In our Solar system, the density of major planets varies from 0.7 g/cm3 (Saturn) to 5.5 g/cm3 (Earth).  For exoplanets, the density varies from very low (0.03 g/cm3 for Kepler-51x) to very high (77.7 g/cm3 for Kepler-131c, data according to NASA Exoplanet Archive).  We know that bodies with low density are composed of gas and others are rocky planets. Wikipedia provides some approximations about it.  Is there any detailed classification of planetary bodies by density? A classification that would say, for example, that the density below 1.5 g/cm3 corresponds to a gas planet; between 1.5 and 3 are icy; between 3 and 8 are rocky; above 8 g/cm3 are even more rocky etc...  Would such a classification make sense?  If it exists, which are the numeric bounds for the different types of bodies? "
3756,What happens if you fail to reach escape velocity for the galaxy?,"I was listening to Skeptics Guide to the Universe the other day, and Steve Novella mentioned that the escape velocity for the galaxy is 544 km/s.  If an object fails to reach escape velocity on Earth, it will return to Earth.  What will be the fate of an object, say the Voyager spacecraft which is currently traveling at 17 km/s, that fail to meet the 544 km/s.  I'm having a hard time wrapping my head around what galactic escape velocity means.    Does this mean that Voyager is incrementally slowing down by the pull of the galaxy?  Given enough time, will it end up in the supermassive black hole in the center? "
3757,Spaghettification of hard-things/Elements,"Is it possible for a black-hole to easily stretch or turn any hard object like (Diamond , Gold bar , Platinum bar , Brass) into spaghettification state in just a seconds or minute once it gets near nor reached the black-hole's event horizon?? "
3758,In what ways does the mass and energy of the milky way curve space time?,Space is curved by mass (or more precisely by mass and momentum as described by the stress-energy tensor). The milky way system has a lot of mass and a lot of energy. In what ways is space-time curved within it?   
3759,Orbiting supermassive black hole or galactic center of mass?,"One of the ways they measure the (supposed?) supermassive black hole at the galactic center of the milky way is to measure those tens of stars right at the galactic center that are orbiting what appears to be nothing, but what is said to be a supermassive black hole.  My question is why there is a distinction between all other stars in the galaxy orbiting (for instance, our own sun) and those few right near the galactic center orbiting.  My point is, if you ask what our solar system orbits, an astronomer wouldn't say ""the supermassive black hole at the center,"" he would say ""the galactic center of mass.""  My assumption is that you couldn't even calculate the mass of the supermassive black hole by knowing our sun's mass and orbit - people would probably say we are too far out, or we are orbiting the galactic center of mass rather than the black hole, yadda yadda.  Questions:  1) Why the distinction?  How do we know that the stars right at the galactic center aren't also orbiting the galactic center of mass vs. the supermassive black hole?  2) What would happen if you magically removed the supermassive black hole in an instant?  Would the stars right at the center continue to orbit the center?  If so, how is that different than what they were originally doing?  Note that I know that center of mass of the galaxy and the supermassive black hole are two different things.  I also know that the center of mass of the galaxy is either superimposed on the supermassive black hole, or quite close to it.  I just want to know how or why some objects feel the center of mass of the galaxy and respond to it, while others feel the pull of the supermassive black hole and respond to it.  How far away do you have to be to be considered ""orbiting the center of mass"" rather than ""orbiting the supermassive black hole?"" "
3760,Why did the big bang not just produce a big black hole?,"Questions I've often wondered about:  1) If all the matter and energy were concentrated at a single point at the big bang, why wasn't that a black hole, or why didn't it form one?  2) If the reason #1 above didn't form a black hole is one of several explanations such as inflation or whatever else, then why didn't all the mass and energy form a big black hole at some finite time after this big bang happened?  For instance, I've (possibly incorrectly) heard that inflation made the universe the size of an orange.  Well why didn't it form a black hole then?  Or once the universe expanded to, say, the size of the moon.  Why not then?  Just insert whatever reasonable size you want in place of ""orange"" or ""moon.""  The question is why didn't a black hole form out of all the matter and energy after the big bang?  Thanks. "
3761,Standard practices and models for generating the ephemerides of the solar system,"I am familiar with the theory on generating the positions of the members of the solar system, but have been unable to find out the standard practices and methods of professional astronomers in acquiring this information. The basic methods of generating an ephemeris of the solar system can be found on the Wikipedia. Also, I have the book Astronomical Algorithms by Jean Meeus.  How do practicing astronomers do it though? Are there standard programs or software that everyone uses, or do they access servers at some international body that returns positions at a given time, or does each astronomer have his own custom program that he made? What is the normal way an astronomer gets planetary positions? "

Finally, after getting the fits files, I wanted to resample the images using the swarp tool. with output size of 64. I ran the swarp tool in few sample images, the resulting image is all zeros in each and every pixel values(if we can call it that).  I have a couple of questions: 1. Is the method of downloading frames related to a galaxy based on run, rerun, field and camcol of the PhotoObjAll table in the SDSS casjobs server correct?  2.

3764,How do we know the big bang expanded space and not the other way around?,"Whenever we hear an explanation about the big bang, it is always phrased in such a way that it was an explosion which used some kind of pressure to expanded the universe out.  I wonder, however, would it be possible that our universe bubble started as a point that wrapped around the singularity and contained it.  Then, for some reason, this bubble started to expand, which caused the energy in the singularity to fill the newly created empty space.  Could it be that this bubble, which is now our universe, is still expanding, and the universe is still trying to fill the space, which is why we see dark energy?  Could we even know, or would either way look exactly the same to us? "
3765,Why is the Oort cloud presumed to be spherical?,"Most descriptions of the Oort cloud depict it as a mostly spherical distribution of planetesimals, with occasional allowance for an inner component that is more donut-shaped. This is slightly at odds with the fact that most protoplanetary clouds and their derivative objects - planets, asteroids, comets and dust - will collapse to a fairly well-defined plane relatively early in a stellar system's evolution.  What evidence is used to postulate this? Does it come from numerical simulations of the solar system? Or does it help account for observed orbital inclinations of real comets? "
3766,Which stars did the Sun form with?,"The Sun formed 4.5 billion years ago, in a molecular cloud. I assume that there were other stars in the vicinity (as is common in molecular clouds). Which stars are they? Where are they now? Are they similar to the Sun? "
3767,Explanation for the mathematics behind Venus' retrograde motion,I've always been interested by the pattern within Venus' orbit around the sun.

3768,What is wrong with this measurement of the synodic period of Mercury?,"I'm measuring the synodic period of Mercury using Stellarium. When measuring the synodic period one needs to choose a reference point to start the measurement, and I choose the point when Mercury is on top of the Sun. This is the start date:    And this is the end date:    Inputting these two dates into a calculator gives a synodic period of 104 days. However, as one can see from Stellarium's data, Mercury's synodic period is actually 115.88 days. This measurement is off by more than 10 days.  Why is there such a large difference? It's not large in the absolute sense, but it seems well above the error margins. For example if instead I shift the start date to 9 April 2021, Mercury is discernibly not between us and the Sun. "
3769,What is the long term fate of the gas giants?,"If I'm not mistaken, it is believed that the reason for such turbulent weather on the 4 outer gas giant planets is that the internal pressure is so great that it is generating heat, which is causing convection, which causes extreme weather.  Will these planets forever generate heat, or at some point will they freeze up?    What will Jupiter look like a trillion years from now? "
3770,Seconds of Arc and the Unaided Eye,"I've been presented with this problem:         Say that Jupiter, with its diameter of 142,000 km, was located where Mars now orbits.  What would be the angular size of (the newly-relocated) Jupiter during a close approach, when its distance would be 79,300,000 km?  Would we be able to see Jupiter as a round object with our unaided eye, or only as a point of light?         The angular size is easy enough to calculate given [tex]. So [tex] meaning Angular Size = 369 seconds of arc.       However, would the unaided eye be able to see this? Knowing that the eye can detect 1 minute of arc across, surely  it can detect 6.15? Any help appreciated, thanks! "
3771,"How bright are the outer planets, when at close range?","Seven probes have passed by or orbited outer planets. I wonder how their photos differ from the naked eye view one would have if one were actually there.  Saturn is 10 AU from the Sun, which means that it has just 1% of the sunlight we have on Earth. Would an astronaut orbiting Saturn, looking out of the window, even notice that Saturn is there? A clouded winter night on Earth can be really very dark, so you can't see where you put your foot while walking. But the outer planets at least have star light and a wage glimpse of the sun.  Can the light conditions out there be compared to a clear night on Earth with a full moon, half moon or new moon? "
3772,Will intergalactic travel be impossible in roughly 15 billion years?,"Even if we (or aliens somewhere in the universe living at that time) somehow invent something that can go just short of the speed of light, will intergalactic travel still be impossible in roughly 15 billion years?  Another way to put it, will even the nearest galaxy be receding from us faster than the speed of light in roughly 15 billion years?  To me, that would seem to require dark energy to increase dramatically, but seems to be the conclusion after thinking on the following points (although the expansion of space itself probably alters this estimate significantly):  In some further thought on the premises I posed in this linked question, I came to the realization that the universe may be ""rapidly"" changing: Is there a physical limit to how far we can go?  Edit: This is different than that question in that I am focused now on the future state of our universe (when - the focus of this question) vs. the location (where - which was the focus of the prior question).   Known facts:   There is a part of the universe, about 15 billion years away, that is receding beyond the speed of light, and hence we can never reach. If we were to pick a direction, there are a finite number of galaxies between here and that 15 billion light year position, (and I therefore deduce at some point, we would not be able to reach the next galaxy.) Space is fairly uniform, so similar conditions should be present on a large scale It would take at least 15 billion years to reach that edge, not accounting for space expansion.   My thought / question with the above in mind, does this mean that if we were to keep traveling, it is inevitable that we will eventually pass the last galaxy we can reach, and then all galaxies would be out of reach (except possibly the last one)?  Does this mean that in 15 billion years (then adjust for the expansion of space) that we won't even be able to reach the nearest galaxies, even if we find a way to travel at the speed of light? "
3773,"Observing a point 13.82b ly away, 1b years ago","I understand that we can observe far away galaxies to get an idea how the universe looked like in the past.   Assuming the universe is 13.82b years old, would it be correct to say that if we looked at a galaxy that was 13.82b ly away, we would see whatever happened just after the big bang? If this is correct, what would we have observed had we looked at the same point 1b years ago?   Is this an application for special relativity? "
3774,How to calculate the orbits of Neptune and Pluto based on the orbits of Uranus and Neptune respectively?,"I get the below from Neptune and Pluto.     In 1821, Alexis Bouvard published astronomical tables of the orbit of Neptune's neighbour Uranus.[22] Subsequent observations revealed substantial deviations from the tables, leading Bouvard to hypothesise that an unknown body was perturbing the orbit through gravitational interaction.[23] In 1843, John Couch Adams began work on the orbit of Uranus using the data he had. Via Cambridge Observatory director James Challis, he requested extra data from Sir George Airy, the Astronomer Royal, who supplied it in February 1844. Adams continued to work in 1845–46 and produced several different estimates of a new planet.      In the 1840s, Urbain Le Verrier used Newtonian mechanics to predict the position of the then-undiscovered planet Neptune after analysing perturbations in the orbit of Uranus.[26] Subsequent observations of Neptune in the late 19th century led astronomers to speculate that Uranus's orbit was being disturbed by another planet besides Neptune.   Does anyone know how did people calculate their orbits in 19th century? It is not a three-body problem, right? "
3775,What am I looking at here at Google Sky?,"I was looking through the Google Sky map, when an object caught my eye:    I am really curious as to what this is (just a big star? then why does it look so peculiar?)

Is it now trapped inside the event horizon even though technically it only interacted with the black hole on a gravitational level? "
3778,Would the existence of Planet Nine rule out the possibility of a sixth giant planet?,"I'm aware that there have been attempts to simulate the evolution of the Solar System with six giant planets1, as opposed to the traditional four or five. The recent proposed Planet Nine would probably invalidate some of those models, although I don't know how drastic its effects would be.  Would Planet Nine fit into models with six giant planets? Have any simulations been done that support such a  scenario?    1 The models I'm most familiar with were created by Nesvorny &amp; Morbidelli (2012). "
3779,"As viewed from Mars, what are Jupiter's and Saturn's maximum brightness in apparent magnitude?","From Earth, Jupiter's maximum brightness is -2.94 and Saturn's is -0.24. But what about from Mars? They should be brighter, but by how much?  There are equations at the obvious wiki entry but I'm not sure I understand them. Plus I'm afraid to attempt this calculation myself because I've heard that this sort of thing does not follow the inverse square law. They're reflecting light (not generating it), and I read somewhere that it should follow an inverse 4th power law because of that. I don't see any 4th powers in the apparent magnitude equations. "
3780,What was Bradley's observation concerning abevation of light?,"As far as I understand, the effect of parallax exhibits itself in the shift of a star relative to the background stars on photographs.   As for the aberration of light, how is it reflected? It would not cause the relative shift of a star in a background, right? Because all the stars (the foreground one and the background ones) will be rotated as a whole, right?   So, what was Bradley's observation?     "
3781,Do gravitationally bound (e.g. orbiting) objects really resist the expansion of space?,"Thinking about the expansion of space, it is commonly explained that gravitationally bound objects (like galaxies and galaxy clusters) will not be affected by the expansion of space (dark energy).  I personally don't get why this would be, I would think galaxies, and things orbiting one another (e.g. solar systems) would be impacted.  If space doubled, the orbit distance should double.  I do get that things bound together gravitationally (perhaps a second definition / originally meant definition of ""gravitationally bound"") (e.g. planets, stars, asteroids, etc...) would not get ripped apart as space gradually doubles.  They would just pull themselves back together, and resist the very weak force of the expansion of space.  Is my understanding correct that things held together by gravity (like stars and planets) will hold together as space continues to expand, but things in orbit (e.g. stars orbiting within the galaxy, and planets orbiting stars) will be moved further out with the expansion of space?  It seems this could be fairly easily verified or refuted by seeing if ancient galaxies (those really far away) are denser than closer galaxies.  If they are denser, then this is strong support for the idea, and if not, then it largely refutes it.    I have a feeling this might be why quasars stopped happening at some point, and are now just observable in great distances (where we are seeing them in the past).  My understanding is that a quasar is the supermassive black hole at the center of a galaxy feeding on large amounts of material.  Back to my main question though, does the expansion of space thin out galaxies / solar systems? "
3782,Change of orbit with change of mass?,"In the science fiction book 2010, monoliths increase the mass of Jupiter until it becomes a star.  [website]  The Leonov crew flees Jupiter as a mysterious dark spot appears on   Jupiter and begins to grow. HAL's telescope observations reveal that   the ""Great Black Spot"" is, in fact, a vast population of monoliths,   increasing at an exponential rate, which appear to be eating the   planet. By acting as self-replicating machines, these monoliths   increase Jupiter's density until the planet achieves nuclear fusion,   becoming a small star.   Obviously fiction.  But my question is about orbits and the mass of orbiting bodies.  For planets, whose mass is negligible compared to their star, I understand one can ignore mass for purposes of calculating orbits.    But if Jupiter were by scifi magic made as massive as a star, would its orbit remain the same regardless?  Or if it were made to stay on its same orbital path, would it have to move more quickly, completing its orbit of Sol in a shorter time? "
3783,Understanding the theory of an expanding Universe,How did Edwin Hubble determine the Universe was expanding?  Was he looking in a particular direction?  And where does this Galaxy sit in the expansion.

3785,How many observations does it take to determine the orbit of a TNO,"Several observations of a distant solar object must be taken before determining its orbit, but in the case of objects discovered beyond Neptune's orbit, just how many are required over what period of time (or what portion of arc) before a reasonably accurate orbit can be determined, sufficient, say, to be added to the Minor Planet Database or a JPL ephemeris?  I'd be interested to know to what degree of certainty orbital elements for objects beyond 30 AU can be determined when we have only observed them for (so far) short portions of their orbits. What about 60 AU, or 90 AU?  As an example, the Wiki for VNH004, a TNO that is a photo target for the New Horizons probe, states:     The asteroid only was observed 12 times by the Mauna Kea and Las Campanas Observatory over a period of about 33.8 days between May 29th and July 2nd, 2011, so its current orbit is extremely uncertain.   How uncertain? Here are orbital elements along with +/- values:     Heliocentric elements and errors   Epoch . . . . . .  2455710.5000  =  2011/05/29   Mean Anomaly: . . .       309.75557 +/-    31.234   Argument of Peri: .     112.06593 +/-    54.010   Long of Asc Node:  .    247.74234 +/-     3.336   Inclination: .  . . . . . . . .   3.81106 +/-     0.396   Eccentricity: . . . . .     0.29886369 +/-    0.8050   Semi-Major Axis: .    37.47217640 +/-   14.2156   Time of Perihelion: 2467404.0720 +/-    2926.4   Perihelion: . . . . . . .   26.27310354 +/-   31.7695   Aphelion: . . . . . . . .    48.67124926 +/-   35.3678   Period (y) . . . . . . . . . . 229.3885 +/-    130.53     An orbital period of over 229 years, plus or minus over 130 years.

3786,Would I actually be able to see Ceres without shining a really bright torch onto it?,"NASA's put out a semi-CGI video of a Ceres flyby using material from the Dawn mission.  Now I realise that visibility is relative, even on Earth: I can walk into my basement and not be able to see anything until I've stood there for a few moments letting my eyes adjust. But I'm wondering, since Ceres is so far from Earth, and despite the images we see beamed back from spacecraft, if I were on a spacecraft in orbit of Ceres, facing the side of Ceres that faces the Sun, would I be able to see its surface with the naked eye? Or is sunlight too dim at that distance to do the job on its own? "
3787,How does the dense atmosphere of Venus affect the planet's rotation?,"Reading through questions about my favourite planet, Venus, I came across this answer to the question What is the current accepted theory as to why Venus has a slow retrograde rotation?, specifically where the answer suggests one of the possible reasons for the slow retrograde motion as being     The spin slowed to a standstill and then reversed, caused by the sun's gravity, the dense atmosphere and friction between core and mantle   Based on a fairly recent study published in the Nature article ""The four final rotation states of Venus (Alexandre C. M. Correia &amp; Jacques Laskar, 2001).  Given the relatively high density of the Venusian atmosphere, this leads to the question:  How does the dense atmosphere of Venus affect the planet's rotation? "
3788,What are the last images from the Galileo orbiter before impacting Jupiter?,"NASA's Galileo orbiter at Jupiter ended its mission in 2003 by intentionally dive into the gas planet. Did it take and transmit any close up images before it ceased to function? If not, why? Are there any images from Galileo, or its separate impactor probe, which show the Jovian clouds from close enough range that their topology is discernible?  On all images I've seen, Jupiter looks like a perfect sphere because of its huge size and far distances from which it has been imaged. But if two spacecrafts have dived into it, there should be close up images of its clouds, right? "
3789,"What is ""emission measure""?","Many papers mention emission measure, and some of them give the expression of EM, BUT there is no clear definition of EM.  My question is what EM is on earth? Its unit is supposed to be cm-3.  How to calculate EM? here(4B5) gives an expression, but it can not be derived from a light curve directly.  Given an X-ray light curve(not from the Sun), probably I need to devide the light curve into many bins and do spectral fitting.  Then what should I do?

3790,Terminology: Is there a name for the points on the surfaces of tidally locked parent/satellite bodies that always face each other?,"This is purely a question about terminology, one that has eluded my googling efforts.   When a satellite and its parent body are tidally locked to each other, there is (in an ideal case) a single point on the surface of the parent body and on the surface of the satellite body that remain the closest two points on the two bodes at all times.  Is there a specific name for those two points? If so, what is it? I think ""antipodal points"" is descriptive, but I wonder if there is a more specific term.  Thank you! "
3791,What will New Horizons be able to say about a magnetic field at Pluto?,"Does NASA's New Horizons flyby probe to Pluto have instruments to measure Pluto's (or Charon's) magnetic field, if any?  I'm a bit confused by the Wikipedia article which says that New Horizons, during its flyby of Jupiter, on one hand:     Travelling through the planet's magnetosphere New Horizons collected   valuable particle readings.[45] ""Bubbles"" of plasma which are believed   to be formed from material ejected by the moon Io were noticed in the   magnetotail.[47]   But then on the other hand:     An objective to measure any magnetic field of Pluto was dropped. A   magnetometer instrument could not be implemented within a reasonable   mass budget and schedule, and SWAP and PEPSSI could do an indirect job   detecting some magnetic field around Pluto.   And how true is this story which I read or heard somewhere? That when New Horizons was being built and launched, no one really believed that Pluto could have a magnetic field. But since then planetary science has advanced and it is now plausible that it might have a magnetic field, because of tidal forces between Pluto and Charon which might make both objects somewhat fluid and possibly generating magnetic fields.

3792,What are the prerequisites for a meteorite to reach the ground?,"I'm sure it's a function of atmospheric entry angle, meteorite mass (and possibly composition/density), and its velocity, but what function is it?  Above all, how does it depend on velocity? Will the slower meteors impact more often (less kinetic energy to dissipate) or the fast ones (less time spent in the atmosphere = less time to melt and evaporate all the way through)? "
3793,"Hulse Taylor Binary Pulsar - How is ""Cumulative Periastron Time shift"" calculated?","Following on from a previous question about the interesting Hulse Taylor Binary Pulsar.  BACKGROUD  Weisberg &amp; Taylor, 2004 present a graph showing the change in ""Cumulative Periastron Time Shift"" over a 30 year period.  Here is a later version of that graph   The graph indicates excellent agreement between the observed data points and the theoretical curve predicted by the General Theory of Relativity (GTR).    The authors determined the theoretical change in orbit period [tex] over time (due to orbital energy loss from emission of gravitational waves) from a formula (Peters &amp; Matthews (1963)) of the form:- [tex]  where K is an (effectively constant) function of the masses of the two stars and the orbit eccentricity. For the Hulse-Taylor Binary, the period [tex] is approximately 7.75 hours and the value of K is approximately [tex], giving an approximate value of [tex]  If [tex] is constant then obviously we can determine the period [tex] at a future time by applying the formula [tex] As a rough initial estimate over one year the approximate change in period is: 365.25 x 24 x 3600 x -2.34 x 10^{-12} = 0.074 ms. (Wikipedia article indicates 0.076 ms.)  But [tex] is not constant because it depends on the value of [tex] which obviously changes.  So we would expect the period to decay over time and the rate of decay to increase with time. However, the change in P is currently so very small that over the period of 30 years the change in dP/dt (which is a function of [tex]) is extremely small also. (It is important to appreciate that the graph shown above does not plot [tex] against time).  zibadawa timmy (thanks) provided the formula [tex] giving:-   $$ P_t = \left( \frac{8}{3} (Kt+C)\right)^{3/8} \qquad \mathrm{with}\qquad C=\frac{3}{8} P_o^{8/3} $$  hence  $$ P_t =   \left( \frac{8}{3} Kt+ P_o^{8/3})\right)^{3/8}  =  \left(  \frac{-1.6\,t}{10^4}+ P_o^{8/3}\right)^{3/8}  =  \left(  \frac{-1.6\,t}{10^4}+ 27900^{8/3}\right)^{3/8}  $$ for 1 year , t = 31,557,600 s., so -1.6 t/10^4 = -5,049.12 = c. 5e3  for 10 years t = 310,557,600 s., so -1.6 t/10^4 = -50,491.2 = c. 5e4  while 27900^{8/3} = 716,051,966,959.181 = c. 7e11.  So  $$ P_{1 year} = (-5049.12 + 716,051,966,959.181)^{3/8} = 27,899.999 926 s,\qquad deltaP_{1 year} = -0.0000738 s. $$ $$ P_{10 years} = (-50491.2 + 716,051,966,959.181)^{3/8} =  27,899.999 262 s,\qquad deltaP_{10 years} = -0.000738 s. $$ These [tex] values indicate that the value of [tex] is effectively constant ($=-0.000 073 8 s/s) over 10years.    QUESTION 1 - What is plotted on the graph? ([tex] What is Cumulative Perihelion Time Shift?) (ANSWERED).   Initially I was confused about what the Weisberg &amp; Taylor graph was actually plotting.  The 2004 paper has ""The observed and theoretical decays are compared graphically in Figure 1"".  The wikipedia article labels the y-axis ""Cumulative Period Shift"" but the caption reads ""observed change in the epoch of periastron with date"".  An earlier 1981 Scientific American article indicates that the vertical axis of the graph indicates the difference (round data points) between (A) the calculated epoch of a periastron event in a hypothetical ""steady"" system whose orbital period remains constant and (B) the observed epoch of the corresponding actual periastron event in the ""decaying""-period system. Also shown is the continuous curve showing the difference between (A) steady system periastron epochs and (C) theoretical predictions of decayed periastron epochs.   The periastron's of the actual and hypothetical orbits are synchronized at [tex] (in late 1974).    QUESTION 2 - How are the theoretical values of CPTS Calculated? (ANSWERED).  Several (similar) methods have now been identified.  Method 1 The method(s) used by Weisberg &amp; Taylor to calculate theoretical values of CPTS have not been identified. These following methods seem reasonable candidates, based on the agreement with their results.  Method 2 (see Stan Liou's answer) Stan Liou has provided a formula [tex] that produces values which closely match the Weisberg &amp; Taylor graph.    Method 3 (see my answer Method 3) I have derived a formula identical to Stan Liou's but derived using phase instead of mean anomaly.  Another formula is derived from the same trunk expressing [tex] in terms of [tex] [tex].  Method 4 (see my answer Method 4) I have derived a formula derived using a coarsely approximated  binomial series which gives similar results  [tex].    Method 5 (not shown) A finely approximated series expansion approach has been assessed. For the given binary system it produces a formula that is effectively indistinguishable from that of the other methods for the given time range. "

3798,Why is carbon so rare on the Moon and on Mars?,"Carbon is the fourth most common element in the universe and in the Solar system. It is about the ninth most common element in Earth's crust. It doesn't seem to be part of any of the ten most common compounds in the Earth's crust.   So where is all the carbon hiding? Why isn't it more common in planetary and lunar crusts?  Is it maybe mostly occurring in volatiles together with hydrogen and oxygen, and has left bodies which lack atmosphere or freezing temperatures? Is it primarily biological processes which binds carbon to solid molecules? Having a look around on Earth's natural surface today, there's lots of solid carbon compounds everywhere, so the contrast is interesting. "

The galaxies are not ""doomed"". However the paragraph below is interesting:     Our Milky Way, for example, is on an inevitable collision course with the neighboring behemoth galaxy — Andromeda. Individual star systems like ours will likely be largely undisrupted, but distant observers will see the two galaxies gradually become one in some four billion years.

What measurements (if any) have contributed to this additional level of prediction?     The current data could be improved by future additional HST observations. Also, soon it will be possible to compare them with independent water maser measurements for individual sources in M31 (see this Letter), which might allow measurement of other cool effects, such as the M31 proper motion rotation, and the increase in Andromeda’s apparent size due to its motion towards us.

3802,SPICE Alt Az example,"Original question below, but my question is now about how can I supply lat/lon coordinates for other locations other than the one in the example below?  It is possible to use NASA's SPICE toolkit to produce Alt/Az coordinates?  I haven't been able to find any examples.  Update:2 The code below doesn't appear to be along the right lines.  I've posted an answer with the ""most"" correct code I could come up with.  Update:  I think I partly figured it out.  Apparently most people call it Elevation and Azimuth, not AltAz, which is why I couldn't find anything.  I found a SpiceyPy example which generates the Az, El for DSS-13.  But I'm at a loss as to how to specify the Lat,Lon for general locations.  Looking through the kernel file, the closest thing I see that could be a lat/lon for DSS-13 are the ""TOPO_ANGLES"" which are -243.2055404763616,-54.7528357325366, which is a pretty odd format if its supposed to be lat,lon.  I was unable to find the real lat/lon for DSS-13, but I was able to find it for DSS-14 which appears in the same file (FYI those coords are 116.89W, 35.426666666666N).  I verified the results with Horizons and they match exactly.    Below I provide a stripped down version of the example to only print out the el/az coordinates.

3805,Leonid meteor showers and the Tempel-Tuttle comet,"I've been reading about the Leonid meteor showers and am struggling to understand one piece of information. On Wikipedia (Tempel-Tuttle), it states:     The orbit of 55P/Tempel–Tuttle intersects that of Earth near exactly,   hence streams of material ejected from the comet during perihelion   passes do not have to spread out over time to encounter Earth. This   coincidence means that streams from the comet at perihelion are still   dense when they encounter Earth, resulting in the 33 year cycle of   Leonid meteor storms. For example, in November 2009, the earth passed   through meteors left behind mainly from the 1466 and 1533 orbit.   Why are we going through the meteors left behind by the orbits from 1466 and 1533? What happened to the orbit of 1500 and every subsequent orbit?  My guess is that the perihelion moves slightly from orbit to orbit so the earth moves through a different one each time but I'd love to get an expert explanation! "
3806,Can General Relativity indicate phase-dependent variations in planetary orbital acceleration?,"In a previous question about differences in Newtonian and GTR gravitional force for the case of star-planet gravitational interactions an approximate relationship was noted between the expressions for the gravitational force exerted by a star on an orbiting planet (the solution is valid situations with low gravity, slow orbital speed, and spherical source).  This was based on texts in Walter 2008 and Goldstein et al 2001.  Walter derived an approximate relationship assuming a circular orbit.  Goldstein focussed on deriving an orbit-average expression for perihelion precession.  On re-examining these texts it seems to me that GTR (General Theory of Relativity) provides more than just an orbit-averaged approximation.  Rather it provides a phase-specific formula for total acceleration (in Scwharzschild space-time).  The equation of motion for a Newtonian orbit is [tex] where [tex] and [tex] d[tex]d[tex] and [tex] is specific angular momentum which is constant, [tex] the gravitational parameter, [tex] is Newton's Universal gravitational constant, [tex] is mass of the star, [tex] is distance from star to planet, [tex] is the True anomaly.  Using [tex] where [tex] is the instantaneous transverse component of velocity (in vector terms = full velocity minus radial velocity) we can  obtain [tex] where the term in brackets is the Newtonian acceleration.  Walter presents the following equation for a GTR orbit (Schwarzschild model)  [tex]   Now, using [tex] and [tex] we get  $$u''_\theta + u_\theta  =\frac{\mu}{Vt_\theta^2 \,r_\theta^2} + \frac{3\mu}{c^2 \,r_\theta^2} =\frac{1}{Vt_\theta^2 }  \left( \frac{\mu}{r_\theta^2} \,+ \frac{\mu}{r_\theta^2} \,\frac{3\,Vt_\theta^2}{c^2 } \right)$$  where the terms in brackets are the Newtonian acceleration and the extra acceleration according to GTR.  And so the ratio of Newtonian acceleration to GTR-specific acceleration, at any angle [tex] is  [tex]. Goldstein emphasises that the GR acceleration does not indicate a velocity-dependence, so an alternative, more palatable, distance-dependent form of the ratio of accelerations, at any angle [tex], would be:- $$1 \, \mathrm{to} \, \frac {3 h^2}{c^2 \, r_\theta^2} \equiv  1 \, \mathrm{to} \, \frac {3 GM.P}{c^2 \, r_\theta^2} $$ where [tex] (specific angular momentum) and [tex] (semi-latus rectum) are the values for the orbit of the particular subject planet.   And so (ignoring other massive perturbing bodies) the magnitude of the total instantaneous radial force on the planet (of mass [tex]) towards the Sun is given by:- $$ \mathrm{F/m} \,=  \, \frac {GM}{r_\theta^2} + \frac {3 GM.GM.P}{c^2 \, r_\theta^4} $$  N.B. The GTR/Schwarzschild equations relate to proper time and Schwarzschild radial distance, not their Newtonian equivalents so strictly the ratio of accelerations is still an approximation.  Is this analysis valid, or have I missed something?  Update  I have accepted Stan Liou's answer as being very helpful in (a) providing a derivation from GTR/Schwarzschild of the formulae presented by Walter and Goldstein et al. and (b) indicating the imperfect correspondence between GTR terms/concepts and Newtonian terms/concepts.  My understanding is as follows. In a Newtonian central-force elliptical-orbit model the addition of an extra centre-directed acceleration ([tex]), which varies through the orbit as [tex] times the co-temporal standard Newtonian centre-directed gravitational acceleration, can be shown (by first order perturbation analysis or numerical modelling) to produce apsidal precession at a rate (radians per orbit) defined by a Newtonian formula [tex] .  This formula is well-known (see for example Wikipedia Apsidal precession). According to, but not clearly referenced by, this article, the formula (or an algebraic equivalent using other terms) was well known c. 1895 (i.e. before the publications of Gerber 1898 and Einstein 1915).  The formula predicts very well the long-term values of apsidal precession determined using Newtonian models from observations of solar planets.   Various writers (Einstein, Goldstein, Walter, presumably many others) present mathematical arguments indicating how an identical formula can be derived from Einstein's GTR.  The presented arguments may involve approximations (e.g. Walter's use of near-circular orbits, Goldstein's use of orbit-averaged precession) and non-mathematical ""correspondences"" between the concepts/terms of the GTR model and the concepts/terms of the Newtonian model.

3807,How does the Earth move in the sky as seen from the Moon?,"I just want to be sure I am visualizing this correctly, because it seems odd. The Moon is tidally locked to the Earth but there are wobbles to its motion due to libration. So from a point on the surface of the near side of the Moon, the Earth would always be near the same place in the sky? It would describe a small circle or a side-to-side wobble over the course of a month, but never move far from that point?  That would seem very strange, like it was a gigantic stage prop or something. We are so conditioned that everything rises and sets (except for a few stars near the poles).  "
3808,Searches for dipole form of anisotropies (on luminosity distances) in the universe with type Ia supernovae,"There are many articles like this one Testing the isotropy of the Universe by using the JLA compilation of type-Ia supernovae (PDF, arxiv.org) trying to search for a dipole effect in cosmology with type Ia supernovae (used as standard candles). The idea of this kind of search is to do a test of the cosmological principle on a phenomenological approach independantly of some given models (e.g. Tolman-Bondi anistropic model).   They consider a dipole effect on the distance modulus [tex]: [tex] where [tex] is unitary vector pointing in the direction [tex] of the dipole with an amplitude of [tex] and [tex] points the direction of each Type Ia supernova. The distance modulus is related to luminosity distance [tex] as [tex].  There is something that bothers me a bit:  Our peculiar velocity to the universe is usually estimated with the CMB dipole measuments, right? And so the reshifts of SNIa are computed in the CMB frame using this correction.   So, supposing we have that kind of cosmological ansisotropy, how it is not mistakenly corrected with the dipole anisotropy of the CMB (and could also be why all searches of this kind give us an amplitude of anisotropy compatible to 0)?  I mean, the CMB dipole implies a velocity of [tex] km/s in the direction of [tex] and [tex] according to COBE measurments. But what if the CMB dipole is not just due to our peculiar velocity but also to an unknown ""cosmological effect""? This effect would be corrected and nothing will be see when try to make a dipole fit on SNIa measurement, right? "
3809,Why would a tidally-locked rocky planet have a first-order spherical harmonic surface temperature distribution?,"The new Letter to Nature Absence of a thick atmosphere on the terrestrial exoplanet LHS 3844b (also ArXiv) analyzes the thermal infrared light curve from the system (about 4.5 to 5.5 um). The planet is assumed to be tidally locked, so lack of asymmetry in the curve is cited as evidence that there is not thermal inertia due to a thick atmosphere, which is what one would expect for this planet.  In the beginning of the paper the authors say:     We fit the extracted light curve with a simultaneous model of the astrophysical signal and the instrument behavior. The astrophysical signal consisted of a transit model and a first-degree spherical harmonics temperature map to represent the planet’s thermal phase variation.   and later:     In addition to the spherical harmonics model, we also tested a sinusoid model, which has been commonly used to fit other phase curve data.    I am thinking that the incident flux at a given point on the tidally-locked planet would be   [tex]  where [tex] is the static zenith angle at a given point, and so the temperature would be something like  [tex]  Why do they use a first-order spherical harmonic model instead?

3810,How does 67P rotate?,"What can be said about 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko axial tilt?

If not, then the question of a “physical reason” emerges again. "
3812,Can you see man-made lights on the dark side of the Earth from the surface of the moon with the naked eye?,"This question is prompted from a comment on this answer:  Could a person on the surface of the moon see man-made lights on the dark side of the Earth with the naked eye? If not, how much magnification would be required to do see them?  The closest evidence I could find from a quick search was this picture from Salt Lake City Schools' Website: The dark part of Earth is a bit hard to see here, though it can be seen more easily in the full resolution image. You can certainly see something toward the bottom edge in the dark area, but I can't tell for sure if it is lights from Southeast Asia/Oceania or something else.  Edit: As pointed out in the comments, the image of Earth in this photo wasn't actually taken from the moon, but from NASA's Terra and Aqua satellites and combined with the lunar imagery in a 2002 visualization created by NASA to commemorate the 30th anniversary of Apollo 17.

3813,Humans surviving in space,"To my (admittedly limited) understanding a human being in outer space wouldn't last very long, mainly due to three factors:   the extreme cold the intense radiation and the vacuum of space   So if my understanding is correct, humans would die within seconds (if anyone could put an approximate number on this that would be great!).  What I want to know is that if a human being was exposed to space for half that time, would they suffer lasting and life threatening after effects?  In other words, is there any amount of exposure to space that wouldn't result in your imminent or eventual death?  Would exposure of just a hand kill you, or would you just lose that hand?  Would being exposed to space from inside a room with a single open door help much (I am assuming here the room would shield you from much of the radiation in space), or would the other two factors still kill you off?  Please feel free to correct my assumptions wherever I am wrong.  Many thanks for any help offered to my slightly morbid musings on space. "
3814,Can orbits change?,"I was reading about how the planet Mercury changes its orbit. I was wondering if farther away planets, particularly ones with elongated orbits, could do that as well? Planets and objects such Halley's comet, Pluto, Sedna, the dwarf planets, or even planet Nine (if there is one). Could the same happen to those objects, and if so how great are those changes? Can other things change as well like the speed of the orbit, or the size? "
3815,Is there a way to calculate how much damage black hole merger shockwaves inflict on nearby objects?,"Black hole mergers lose respective rotational energy during a merger. I understand that the energy 'emitted' is scattered as gravitational 'energy' that can henceforth be detected by gravitational detectors billions of light years away. I understand that the amount of shockwave energy in stellar mass black hole mergers can be equivalent to the mass of a star such as the sun. So if two rapidly rotating SMBHs on the scale of SagA* merge, the emergy emitted is in the range of hundred thousands of solar masses...?  Either case that is a lot of energy. If a two, let's say, 10 solar mass black holes merge at 10 light years, what are the literal impact effects on a terrestrial planet in such adjacent system?   Barely sensable by its inhabitants? Significant seismic? sufficient to sharply increase volcanism? Agitating the surface to lava? Obliterate small moons or planets in to a large rapidly expanding cloud of interplanetary lahar?  Assume that every ten thousand or less years such merger occurs in the milky way galaxy? Could these mergers constitute existential risks? "
3816,What are realistic and unrealistic values for the high energy gamma ray spectral indices of pulsar wind nebulae?,"This summer, I was working on a project fitting very high energy gamma ray spectra of the Crab Nebula, a pulsar wind nebula. At energies about [tex]1 TeV, a simple power law suffices, i.e. [tex]. Most power law models of the Crab find a spectral index of [tex] (e.g. Hillas 1998, [tex]). Using a normal analysis method on one dataset, I found [tex], which matches the literature values quite well.  Using the modified analysis method I was testing, however, I found [tex]. We believe that method is a poor choice because I showed the calculated flux values were incompatible with previous observations. The spectral index also cast doubts on its viability. However, I was wondering if, for a random pulsar wind nebula, a slightly harder spectral index like [tex] is unphysical, or reasonable.  Therefore, I'm wondering: What is the distribution of spectral indices for power-law models of very high energy spectra of pulsar wind nebulae? Do we have a large enough population of pulsar wind nebulae that we can determine what a typical value for [tex] is, and what range we would expect a spectral index to fall into? In other words, could if I had obtained a certain value for [tex], what value would it need to have for me to reject the result as unphysical? "
3817,How long do planetary rings last?,"I'm surprised that this question hasn't been asked before (here or on Physics), to the best of my knowledge. It's one that I might have asked when I was a bit younger, and one that I think other people will ask.  Anyway, it's clear that Saturn's rings won't form a moon, and the same is likely to be true for other ring systems. However, I'm guessing that they won't last forever (it's just a guess).  How long do planetary rings in general last? What mechanisms could cause them to dissipate/fall apart/end? I'm guessing the Poynting-Robertson effect could come into play, but I'm not sure.  And for anyone curious, yes, I checked just for the fun of it, and Yahoo Answers had a bunch of really, really bad, unsourced and most likely inaccurate answers (given that there was no consensus), ranging from '3 million years' to '13-18 billion years' to 'forever'. "
3818,As of now did a radio telescope ever recorded something else than the silence of space?,"When a radio telescope listen to the Universe; a constant sound is recorded. Is it the noise ""of the mic"" : interferences? Scientists says that when they will notice variations on this basic constant same noise I call ""the interference coming from the mic"" they will conclude on an extra terrestrial source of sound; but in fact if is waves that are ""listen"" to. So, any news? "
3819,Are gas giants actually rare?,"Kepler data suggests that the vast majority of planets are smaller than 4 Earth radii, with larger planets quickly becoming vanishingly scarce. Yet somehow, our own solar system harbours not just one, but two giant planets. This seems suspicious.  Are giant planets expected to be as rare as the Kepler data suggests? Or is there some bias inherent in the transit method that makes detecting giant planets more difficult? Is it perhaps the long orbital period of a planet that formed outside the frost line that has caused this apparent dearth of giant planets? "
3820,Red shifting galaxies,I am an amateur astronomer please correct if any of my understandings are wrong. We all know that from the Hubble's ultra deep field image the most distant galaxies which were created shortly after big bang looked to be red shifted. This is because of the process of expansion of the universe these lights are reached its highest visible wavelength. So in near future (in terms of astronomy) the galaxies which appears to be normal today become red shifted?  and those are already appeared as red shifted become invisible? If it become invisible still can we see it through infrared telescopes right?  
3821,Is axial tilt direction correlated with semi-major axis direction?,"Earth comes closest to the Sun every year around January 3. Winter solstice is at 21-22 December, merely some 12-13 days away. That means projection of Earth rotation axis onto the plane of its orbital movement almost overlaps with its orbit's semi-major axis; the axial tilt direction coincides with the direction Earth orbit is elongated.  I couldn't find corresponding data regarding other bodies in the Solar System.  Is this merely a coincidence, or is there a regularity, with direction of the axial tilt coinciding with eccentricity of the orbit? How does that look like in case of other bodies than Earth? "
3822,Have we detected galaxies which have red-shifted beyond the visible light range?,According to this answer it is possible for galaxies' light to move beyond the visible frequencies due to redshift:  It is possible that eventually the light from them could move into the infrared and even  the microwave in extreme cases.   Could this have already happened?  Have we already looked for it?  Is there a telescope with the instrumentation to detect galaxies' 'light' at these wavelengths? 
3823,Could a Jovian or Saturnian moon keep its atmosphere if the system was within the habitable zone?,"Currently the atmosphere of Titan is 1.5x thicker than Earth's atmosphere, but it's also much much colder. It's been said that an astronomical body can keep it's atmosphere if the escape velocity is more than six times the average speed of the molecules.   Does this mean if a moon like Titan was moved to the habitable zone and heated up to livable temperatures, then it's atmosphere would escape?   What is the minimum gravity necessary for a moon to hold onto an earth-like breathable atmosphere within the Habitable Zone? "
3824,"Instrumental magnitude to ""real"" magnitude - Photometry with not enough data?","I have a lot of data taken in R, B, V, Luminance and Halpha-bands which I want to analyse photometrically (one target in the frame).  The frames are already reduced (with flats, darks etc.) and have a correct wcs-header. I also already have the instrumental magnitude of my target and other stars in the frame (using APT).  My question now is, how do I calculate the real magnitude of my targets?  The most simple way would be comparing the other stars' instrumental magnitude and real magnitude and then applying the (logarithmic/linear?) transformation to the instrumental magnitude of my target. But I don't know how exact that would be and how I could calculate the error of the photometric solution (by applying the same transformation to the error of the instrumental magnitude APT gave me?).  For more exact photometry I don't have enough data, aka air mass or calibration fields.  Do you have any ideas or solutions? "
3825,Why does Earth enjoy a significantly longer time as a habitable planet as compared to Mars or Venus?,"On a related note, why didn't Venus remain habitable for longer than it did? Is the current  hypothesis as to the time when Venus's atmosphere became hostile and what event triggered it, proven true? "
3826,How bright is the full Earth during the lunar midnight?,"At lunar midnight (i.e. the new moon as seen from Earth), the Earth is in its full phase with its entire disk in sunlight, and it is the brightest object in the lunar sky. How bright is it, and how variable is its brightness?  More precisely, I'm interested in specific figures for the magnitude and in comparisons to similar objects. Would I be able to read in that light? To drive? Would I notice the variations in brightness? What are the main variations due to? "
3827,How is the universe bordered?,This answer says that some models describes the universe as finite. How do those models describe the universe's border?  Does the border (theoretically) exist? Is it a solid border? Do they predict what happens if matter crosses this border (maybe it simply can't)? 
3828,Does the universe curve in on itself?,"I've read a little bit about the universe, but its not clear to me if there is a place in the universe beyond which there are no stars.  For example, is there anywhere in the universe that one could go where we would not generally see stars in every direction?  Its seems uncertain to me that there is.  If I were to go to the farthest star from earth magically, rather the via relatively (for argument sake).  I""m guessing it would have stars surrounding it in every direction.  But perhaps I'm wrong, perhaps there is some edge to the explosion of matter from the big bang, beyond which there is nothing.  Do we know if the universe curves in on itself? or is there some other dominant theory? "
3829,What is the relative velocity between planets in different solar systems?,"Is it possible to estimate what the difference in velocity is between the earth and another convenient exoplanet? Or perhaps just our star and a near neighbour?  I'd be curious where I could find the figures, and I'm wondering exactly what the magnitude of the difference is between relatively near neighbours.  Context:  Putting together an outline for a book, and I'm curious about something.  In the book, faster-than-light travel happens through instant travel between two points in space. In doing so, you retain all of your kinetic energy. This means you'll emerge at your destination with the same velocity as you had before you transitioned.  The bulk of the travel time in interstellar travel would simply be matching velocity with your destination before transition - the vast majority of the distance of the journey would be instantaneous, since for traffic control reasons ships are expected to come in at a reasonable speed when compared to their destination. "
3830,How active was the Milky Way in its first 5 billion years?,"When I look into the history of the Milky Way, it seems like the Milky Way has been the pinnacle of stability. It seems highly likely that our galaxy has eaten several smaller galaxies/dwarf galaxies in the past. Also, our galaxy seems to be one of the first to form. I am wondering if our seeming stability is the result of our galaxy's age. So, was the Milky Way more active (as far as stellar formation, supernovae, etc.) in its early years? How do we/ could we know?  "
3831,"How many stars can be seen naked eye from outside the atmosphere? How dense is the ""sky"" from there?","When I was 20, I went to Naxos (Greece) with friends. I was driving my car during the night on the mount Zeus (1003 meters - 3,291 ft) listening Pink Floyd.  Up there we stopped the car to take a walk, looked above and ... wooooooowwwwww!  The sky was dense! Full of stars. We didn't know it could have been like that.  My question is:   How dense is the deep sky from outside the atmosphere?  For example, on the ISS during the night (the Earth that cover the Sun) looking at the deep sky, how many stars can you see? I saw a lot of pictures of the stars taken by the Hubble telescope), but I don't think it can be compared, right?   "
3832,"From CMB anisotropy data observed in 1992, did astronomers figure out that the universe should be accelerating before its discovery in 1998?","CMB anisotropy was measured in 1992. I assume that astronomers, then, like now, would have been able to deduce the cosmological constant and things like that from the CMB anisotropy data. Then, from the cosmological constant and things like that, they would have been able to find that the current universe was accelerating. Did they indeed know that the current universe should be accelerating before its observation in 1998? Or, was the discovery in 1998 a great surprise? What was the exact situation between 1992 and 1998? "
3833,Does astro means space or stars,"In The Big Bang Theory Season 3, Episode 4, Sheldon said that astro means star and Raj said astro means space, I got a little confused here, various websites and others are going 50-50 on the subject. What does astro actually means?     Raj: No, no, no, no! That rate is much too low for what we’d expect from this collision. Do you understand that we’re talking about dark matter colliding in outer space?      Sheldon: Of course I understand. And who are you to tell me about outer space?      Raj: I’m the astrophysicist. Astro means space.      Sheldon: Astro means star.  "
3834,Questions on dark matter observations in galaxy clusters,For cluster of galaxies we can observe velocity distributions and so we can deduce mass from multiwavelength observations. I suppose total mass of the cluster could be deduced by observing velocities of galaxies and applying virial theorem. Is it be done using general relativity or just with classical mechanics ?  An other way could be whith looking at gravitational lensing it causes on far galaxies.   Are these two methods giving same results ? 
3835,Why do I see rainbows around the moon?,"Regularly, I see rainbows around the moon. Here is approximately what I see:    Right at the edge of the moon, I see a bright blue ring of light. Further out, I see an inner rainbow. This is not as bright as the ring, but is still clearly visible. Even further out, I see an outer rainbow that is very faint.   I see the blue ring during every full moon. I see the rainbows more frequently in late fall and winter than in spring or summer. But every year, I see these moon rainbows during a full moon.  Since I see these moon rainbows more frequently in late fall and in winter, are these moon rainbows caused by moonlight reflecting off of ice crystals in cirrus clouds high up enough that I can't see the clouds? Also, why do I see a bright blue ring right at the edge of the moon during every full moon? "
3836,moonless night and lunar phase,"How to define moonless night? There is no moon at all during some night?   How to calculate and know whether the moon would appear during one night?  If the lunar phase is full moon, is it possible that the moon will not appear ? "
3837,Roche Limit for Earth-like body around Earth-like body,"In a discussion elsewhere about binary planets, it came the question.  How near can a planet like Earth (maybe Earth itself) be to another planet like Earth before both of them tearing apart due to tidal forces?  In other words: Which is the Roche limit for Earth, if it were orbiting (another) Earth? "
3838,Are our 'observations' of or near a black hole affected by gravity induced time dilation?,"This answer made me wonder if matter/energy/events near a black hole are viewed (by us) in a very different time frame, how might that affect our measurements?  The people on the smaller planet would observe the people on the extremely large planet  moving in ""slow motion"". (note: due to gravitational time dilation)   On a related note, does light being 'bent' around a black hole experience time dilation or red/blue shift from our viewing perspective? (as possibly suggested by this answer). "
3839,"Estimates for ""undetectable"" planets in extra-solar systems","As far as I've been able to determine, it appears there are some significant  limitations on our ability to detect exo-planets that are below certain sizes or beyond certain distances from their stars.    It seems that Uranus and Neptune are about as small as we can detect unless the planet is relatively close to its star, and Earth is near the lower size limit we can detect, regardless of proximity to the star.     In other words, our bias toward detecting large planets, and planets close to their stars, means I have been able to find reasonably good data regarding how many of those kinds of planets are generally present in a system.  But since we can't seem to tell (by direct observation) how many small planets are generally present in a system, or how many planets are present that are just too far from their star for us to detect, I'm struggling to find data regarding how many plants of those types are common in planetary systems.    For example: our system has 8 planets, 4 rocky, 2 gas giants, 2 ice giants.  But chances are that if we were observing (with current technology) our own Solar system from some other solar system, we'd probably only see 2 to 6 of them.  We'd almost certainly see Jupiter and Saturn, and we'd almost certainly NOT see Mercury or Mars (they're just too small), Venus and Earth ""might be"" close enough to the sun for us to see them even though they are on the small end of what we can detect, and Uranus and Neptune also ""might be"" detectable, even though they are small-ish for their distance from the sun.    My specific question:  How many planets are in a 'normal' or 'average' planetary system, according to humanity's best scientific theories available so far?(beyond what we can simply detect.)  In other words, where can I find reasonable scientific research data sets, models, estimates, theories, evidence, etc., that describe the likelihood of ""undetectable"" (or very hard to detect) planets being present in a planetary system?  This is my first question on Astronomy stackexchange, so please be gentle, but don't hesitate to provide constructive criticism if I'm doing anything wrong. "
3840,Effect of the absence of atmospheric refraction to sun rise and sunset times,"What is the effect of absence of atmospheric refraction on sin rise and sunset time? Is it will be delayed or earlier for sunrise and sunset, and why? Thank you:) "
3841,What is a low mass Black Hole?,Is a Low Mass Black Hole also called a Stellar Mass Black Hole? Can Low Mass BH be also called Primordial BH?  (If low mass BH are Stellar Mass BH-What is their size in terms of the mass of the sun?) 
3842,How much iron does a star fuse before going supernova?,"I understand stars fuse atoms into heavier and heavier elements. When the star starts to fuse iron, the amount of energy released is less than the amount of energy it to takes to fuse the atoms. This creates an energy deficiency and the core is unable to maintain its outward pressure against gravity's inward collapse. The star collapses, rebounds against electron degeneracy pressure (I believe?) and goes BOOM. But how much iron is actually fused? And, for how long is the star fusing iron before the collapse?   Also, as a little bonus, I read somewhere recently that the presence of nickel is possible prior to going supernova. I can't find where though. Was that person wrong?  "
3843,Could the Philae comet lander be recharged by laser?,"Could the Philae comet lander be recharged with a laser (or possibly many lasers) from earth?  My thought would be to aim one or more powerful lasers from earth at the Philae lander to recharge it through its solar panels.    Another thought would be to heat up a small part of the comet with one or more lasers, possibly causing the comet to slowly rotate into a position where the sun light falls onto the lander.    Would either of these ideas be feasible? "
3844,"Why does ""longitude by chronometer"" require first calculating latitude?","I'm studying the history of longitude and Greenwich Time, and I'm currently confused about the ""longitude by chronometer"" technique.  Conceptually, the method seems extremely simple.  With a chronometer (ie. an accurate clock) set to the time of your home port, compare to your local time.  Multiply the difference by [tex] and that will give you the degrees of longitude you have traveled.  According to Derek Howse's Greenwich Time and the Longitude and Dava Sobel's Longitude, this method was first published by Gemma Frisius in 1530, then described again by Richard Eden in 1555.  Both of these authors say that you must first find your latitude.  Here is Frisius in 1530 (emphasis mine):     We must wait until the hand of our clock exactly touches the point of an hour and at the same moment by means of an astrolabe or by means of our globe, we must find out the time of the place at which we now find ourselves.  If this time agrees to the minute with the time shown on our watch, it is certain that we are still on the same meridian or in the same longitude, and our journey has been made towards the south.  But if it differs by one hour or by a number of minutes, then these should be turned into degrees, or minutes of degrees, by the method I set out in the previous chapter, and in this way the longitude is discovered.  In this way I would be able to find the longitude of places, even if I was dragged off unawares across a thousand miles, and even though the distance of my journey was unknown. But then first of all, as always, the latitude must be learnt.  I have already explained this before and also that it can be found out by various methods of finding out the tirne.   Here is Eden in 1555:  And so shall the longitude bee found.  And by    this arte can I fynde the longitude of        regions althowgh I were a thou-         sand myles owt of my attempt-           ted course &amp; in an unkno-            wen distance, but the             latitude must fyrst                bee perfectly                   knowen.   I can't figure out why knowing the latitude would be necessary for calculating longitude by chronometer, unless you need it to calculate the local time.  But it seems to be well established that local time can be easily calculated with a noon sighting of the Sun, corrected for the equation of time.  This method is described here.  Most of the Wikipedia page for Longitude by Chronometer seems to describe a more complicated method that involves finding the intersection of a position line with an assumed latitude.  It also describes solving the navigational triangle.  I'm having trouble following the method described there.  I can't tell whether this is the same method described by Frisius or something else entirely.  So overall my questions are:   Why do Frisius and Eden say that you need to calculate latitude before you can do longitude by chronometer?  Is it just a step in calculating the local time? What is the method described in the ""Longitude by Chronometer"" Wikipedia page, and the navigational triangle stuff?  How does it work, and what benefit does it have over the simple [tex] method?  "
3845,How is the maximum density in a circumstellar disk determined?,"I'm working with some equations to model the evolution of a circumstellar disk. One of the equations is [tex] where [tex] is density, [tex] is the distance from the center, [tex] is a constant, [tex] is one standard deviation, and [tex] is the radius at which the density is at a maximum.  If the function was of the form [tex] where [tex] is a function of [tex], I could find the maximum easily by finding [tex] and solving for [tex]. However, this appears to be impossible in the current case because [tex] is already in the equation, at [tex].  How is [tex] determined in a given scenario? Is it determined experimentally? "
3846,Where did this famous Planetary Precession Formula come from?,"The following equation (which I shall term the Planetary Precession Formula, PPF for short) famously appeared in a 1915  publication by Einstein where he indicated how it could be derived from his General Theory of Relativity (GTR).  [tex]  where [tex] is the (anomalous, non-Newtonian) angular precession per orbit, [tex] is the orbit semi-major axis, [tex] is the speed of light, [tex] is the orbital period, [tex] is the orbit ellipticity.  The PPF formula accurately predicts the (anomalous, non-Newtonian) precession of Mercury and other Solar planets.  The formula was known in scientific circles well before 1915.  For example Gerber (1898) derived it from his own (widely-derided) model of gravity.  In the internet article Gerber's Gravity it is written that      It became a fairly popular activity in the 1890s for physicists to propose various gravitational potentials based on finite propagation speed in order to account for some or all of Mercury's orbital precession.  Oppenheim published a review of these proposals in 1895.  The typical result of such proposals is a predicted non-Newtonian advance of orbital perihelia per revolution of... >   [tex]  where [tex]  is the semi-latus rectum of an ellipse, [tex] is a function of the angular speed [tex] of an orbiting planet: [tex] with [tex] and [tex] is a constant which might be derived from theory.  Clearly with [tex] we get the PPF formula given above.   I wish to know where the [tex] expression comes from. From the article it would appear to come from the 28-page review paper by Oppenheim, 1895 which is scanned here. I have been through the scans of this paper but without finding that equation explicitly (the paper is in German which I know very poorly, Google Translate helps a bit but leaves a lot of ambiguity). It might be that the anonymous author of the article extracted the expression from a review of Oppenheim's paper or even the original (French &amp; German) papers themselves, but he is not contactable.  Maybe someone here is familiar with this era of astrophysical history and can point me in the right direction? "
3847,how far away could we detect that Earth has life?,"My guess is that life bearing planets are too far apart to be detected. I think we can only find the ones within a sphere around our planet that is 100s of light years in diameter but I suspect life bearing planets may be much farther away than that.    I would like to estimate the diameter of the sphere within which we could detect life on another planet and then estimate the probability that there is life within that sphere.   For example, give our current technology what is the furthest distance would be able to detect life on Earth?  How many stars like our sun are in that sphere?  How long would it take for SETI to rule out each of those stars?  "
3848,Can the patterns in the CMB be detected by off-the-shelf antennas/sensors?,"I recently wrote a paper (will attach soon if feasible) for an astronomy class that analyzed the usefulness of the Cosmic Microwave Background as a static reference for attitude determination. The main benefit of this over other attitude determination techniques is that the CMB has a constant pattern, even in intergalactic space. There is some variation over time, but it’s on the order of 1000+ years.  I was able to apply common computer vision algorithms to match randomly rotated rendered images of the CMB to their respective RA, Dec, Roll coordinates. These (completely unoptimized) algorithms tended to require a field of view of (Will find this in a moment) and a resolution of (Will find this in a moment) to be reasonably accurate.  One of my main assumptions is that it would be feasible to make a detector with sufficient resolution and signal-to-noise to be able to spot the CMB variation patterns within a few hours of observation. Is this true? What level of volume, specialization, and/or budget would be needed for this sensor: Cubesat? Smallsat? James Webb Space Telescope? "
3849,Could population III stars develop directly into population I stars?,"Hundreds of millions of years after the Big Bang, the very first stars began to form consisting of mostly hydrogen, a bit of helium, and maybe some lithium. These stars lacked any ""metals"" (elements heavier than helium) and are categorized as Population III stars. We have yet to observe any of these Pop III stars, and observation remains unlikely. The reason for this is because Pop III stars are thought to have been incredibly massive, so they died out so long ago that we can no longer see their light. Pop I stars are metal-rich; their metallicity is 1/10 to 3 times that of our Sun's. In my research, everyone seems to agree that that the first generation of stars had no metal, second generation stars had very little, and third generation stars have some metal.But, no one ever addresses the possibilities. So, is it possible that some Pop III stars were so massive that they were able to skip Pop II and go straight to Pop I? Maybe if several are close by when they go supernova?    "
3850,What range of exit pupils work for observing the full moon?,"I'm observing the full moon, from a major city, with heavy light pollution and dust.  The objective size is fixed, for this comparison, something between 4 and 6 inches. The question is about the tradeoff between magnification and dimness of the image. I'd like to know what range of exit pupils works best. Again, the goal is to observe the full moon.  To put it differently:   What's the smallest exit pupil at which the moon gets so dim that you can't take advantage of the increased magnification? (""Empty magnification""). What's the largest exit pupil at which the moon is bright enough, so a larger exit pupil doesn't help?   The only reference I could find is this, which claims that 1-2mm works best for the moon. Is that correct? "
3851,Would the WISE Survey pick up a large planetary collisions like Theia-Earth? And from how far?,"WISE or Wide-Field Infrared Survey Explorer  Large body collisions are obviously, very very rare, locally speaking, and with stars, often spiraling inwards not direct collisions.  I know that stellar collisions or gradual inward spirals have been observed, but those are much larger and easier to see from far away.  If an impact, like Theia-Earth happened in another solar-system, creating perhaps a synestia or spiraling rock-vapor world, approaching some star's surface temperature, can we say about how close that would need to be to be observed with today's instruments?  Would the outer-most debris cool too quickly and block a lot of the visibility?  My guess is, events like this would be too infrequent to happen within our view, so we shouldn't expect to observe it until we have much better telescopes, but other events weren't expected to be observed, like the gravitational waves from two colliding black holes and that was detected.    If it was close enough the heat from collision and rate of cooling should create a unique signature I would think, so if a planet-planet collision did happen in our general vicinity, we'd recognize it for what it was. "
3852,Strong force and metric expansion,"If the expansion of the universe (the metric) continues (and perhaps is accelerating), in a very large but finite time the expansion of the metric will clash with the effects of the strong nuclear force. What happens then? Would the energy required halt the expansion and if so what is the slowing effect of the ""stretch"" on the strong force today - too small to be measured?  Update: Thanks for the answers so far - I hadn't even considered the big rip scenario. I was merely thinking that as the metric expanded the strong force inside baryons would require unlimited resources of energy to be overcome - but I now understand that is wrong however it still looks to me like a potential perpetual motion machine - continually creating matter/anti-matter pairs. Perhaps that should be a separate question though... "
3853,Could two stars collide without a resultant explosion?,"Are there any scenarios in which two stars could collide, and simply fuse without triggering a supernova. Maybe a mid-sized star slowly spiraling in together with a smaller star? It seems like any time stars collide it's incredibly violent. It seems that one star always gets torn to pieces and accretes matter onto the other, or ends in a red nova. Is there any way this process could be calmer? "
3854,How should one rationally deal with the issue of space travelling alien civilizations?,"What kind of reasoning is appropriate to understand the as of today unanswered question of whether there are (other) interstellar space travelling civilizations in the Milky Way?  We have already sent probes towards the border of the Solar system. And even landed human beings on another celestial body and brought them home alive and well. If we extrapolate the 50 years of space travel, the 100 years of electronics (radio), the 400 years of physical science, to just a fraction of the biological age of humankind into the future (like a few thousands of years), interstellar travel is not out of the question for us or at least our artefacts. So I imagine two possible alternatives:  1) The Milky Way is cluttered by lots of space travelling civilizations like us and our future. Once one of them/us gets going, they'll soon be everywhere. The Sun orbits the Milky Way every 250 million years, about 2% of the age of the galaxy. Going to the nearest stars is enough to soon be everywhere. But if they are everywhere since almost always, they should be here, we should be their seed.  2) We are the only space travelling civilization in the entire galaxy, ever. But then what makes us unique? We consist of the most common elements and volatiles of the universe and our planet and star and galactic location all seem to be very typical. There's no known trace of any uniqueness here. Whatever could it be?  Are there more alternatives?  While we cannot say today which alternative is true, we should be able to at least specify the possible alternatives. But to me they all seem to be absurd! What would be a rational logical scientific approach to this apparent paradox? "
3855,Where is the center point for the Supergalactic coordinate system?,"I'm trying to build a 3D visualization of the Supergalactic coordinate system and couldn't find any reference to where the center point should be (the Sun, galactic center, the Earth, etc).   Also I already tried to look into some articles and books, but they only refer to the zero point related to the galactic coordinates.  Where should it be?  Could I use this model as the reference for the Supergalactic Coordinate system, starting to count the SGL (L) and SGB (B) from the yellow line?  It is still unclear to me if (l=137.37 b=0) indicates just the direction of the center of the Supergalactic Coordinates System.  Note: The Sun is being used as the center point.    Plano Galactico translates into Galactic Plane.  Centro Galactico translates into Galactic Center. "
3856,How does this strategy for chasing the sunset work?,"In Randall Munroe's What If? blog he tackles this question:     What is the longest possible sunset you can experience while driving, assuming we are obeying the speed limit and driving on paved roads?   His final answer is the following, which allows you to experience about a 95 minute sunset. But the diagram isn't the most self-evident. What does the diagram mean, and how does the strategy work?     If you're in northern Norway on a day when the Sun just barely sets and then rises again, the terminator (day-night line) moves across the land in this pattern:      To get a long sunset, the strategy is simple: Wait for the date when the terminator will just barely reach your position. Sit in your car until the terminator reaches you, drive north to stay a little ahead of it for as long as you can (depending on the local road layout), then u-turn and drive back south fast enough that you can get past it to the safety of darkness.

3857,Distance between Earth and where The Big Bang's happened?, The universe is around 13.8 billion years old. We know how fast the light is. We also know how fast our galaxy moving around inside observable universe.   Is it possible to calculating distance between Earth and the place where The Big Bang happened ? If so how far away our planet ? and is there a something special about this place ? (A black hole or something else really crazy?) 
3858,From what distance can one object influence gravity of another object?,Each object in the universe has its own gravitational influence on all other objects in the universe. What distance do they have to be from each other to create only one gravitational influence? Example - Every human does in my opinion contribute to the earth gravitation thanks to the mass of our bodies. Now would there be a difference if I distanced myself from the surface by any amount? 
3859,How big a rock can hit the sun and it not matter?,If a rock the size of Oumuamua were to crash into the sun — assume central collision — would it materially affect the sun’s behaviour? Would unaided humans (rather than sun-tastic special telescopes) notice a change in the sun’s brightness or colour or something?  What if the rock were the mass of Pluto? The Moon? The Earth? How big a rock can smite the sun and unaided humans not notice?  Edit: this is not about long-term effects of a merger. This is about the on-the-day or maybe in-the-month effects. How large would a rock need to be for its collision with the sun to have an effect?  
3860,Is seeing the apollo moon Landers via earth telescope that hard?,"There are interferometers, which are combining multiple telescopes together, with 0.001 arcsecond resolution. With changes, couldn't these observe the Landers? Is the reason why nobody is seeing the Landers related to effort and not actual technical limitation? Besides atmosphere interference, brightness, time use and other general issues. "
3861,Why Is The Expansion of The Universe Allowed To Move Faster Than Light?,"Why is the expansion of the universe allowed to faster than light if everything that moves within a vacuum can't reach the speed limit of light?  I've read that astronomers looked at the distance between galaxies but I'm still not understanding what's going on. If objects in the universe can't go faster than the speed of light in a vacuum, how are galaxies (which objects within the universe) moving away from each other faster than light? "
3862,How to discover Neptune from the Uranus orbit (by computer simulation),"I would like to demonstrate the existence of another planet (Neptune) by studying the discrepancy between the observation of the Uranus orbit and the mathematical prediction, this work was made from Le Verrier and I would like to understand his method.  I have read the Chapter 2, ""The Discovery of Neptune (1845-1846),"" in the biography Le Verrier -- Magnificent and Detestable Astronomer, but it is too much in-depth and I did not understand very well his work.  I am studying the three-body problem (Sun, Uranus, Neptune) via Matlab and the two body problem (Sun, Uranus) taking the initial condition from here:  [website]I have tried this method: I put Uranus in the Perihelion with the Max. orbital velocity and I calculate the semi-major axis, and it is more accurate than the one obtained from putting Uranus and Neptune in the Perihelion with their respective Max. orbital velocity.  Here a cool pic made with Matlab:   Can anybody help me? what I have to do and with what data I have to compare my prediction? Even a simple link could be helpful. "
3863,Hulse-Taylor binary pulsar - what is the rate of mass/energy loss from the source?,"Following on from an earlier question about the very interesting Hulse-Taylor binary pulsar.  The high-frequency (radio) beam from the spinning pulsar sweeps across Earth about 17 times per second.  The total power of the gravitational radiation (waves) emitted by the binary system is calculated from GTR to be [tex] watts at present (declining as the orbital period and radius diminish).  Weisberg &amp; Taylor, 2004 report that the beam has ""a flux density of about 1 mJy at 1400 MHz.""  (mJy = milliJansky, thanks Stan Liou). Assuming that this flux is uniform across a conical beam with cross-sectional radius 5 arc degrees  and assuming that the source is 21,000 light years from Earth and has mass = 1.44 Solar Masses:-  How much energy is emitted (per second) from the source in the beam? Also (if it is possible to estimate a reasonable range of values) what might be the rate of steady mass loss from such a source?   "
3864,"How do astronomers know if a planet is orbiting a star, or it's simply another star in the background?","For example, if astronomers photograph a ""planet"", which is in close proximity to a given star, then this ""planet"", could actually just be another ""star"" in the background, many light years away.  It might just be in the photograph by chance.  How can astronomers determine if this is, in fact, a planet orbiting that star or just another star many light years away?    For example, a common method to find planets orbiting stars is the transit method. ie, we can observe how the star appears to slowly decrease brightness, then increase back to normal again. This basically tells astronomers that this must be a planet.  But how do astronomers know that this isn't just the ""front star"" transitting a star ""in the background""? "
3865,Voyager spacecrafts,"Will the Voyager space crafts actually reach another Star System in 63,000 years? If the answer is yes, what will be  powering the crafts to keep them going for so long? "
3866,Does blackhole merging break their event horizon segregation?,"So far as I know, if we have 2 blackholes A and B, both having their own event horizons, then what's inside the event horizon of A remains completely unknown to us, and same for what's inside the event horizon of B.  Now, suppose A and B coalesce (merge). So we now have a single blackhole C, with its own new event horizon.  This would mean that what was inside the event horizon of A now ""knows"" what is inside the event horizon of B.  Would this mean that all event horizons of all blackholes are actually ""linkable"" together since they might all merge at some point?    Edit: After watching the suggested video, I can try rewording the question:  Suppose Alice and Bob are outside blackholes A and B.  Alice jumps into blackhole A, and Bob jumps into blackhole B.  Bob never sees Alice crossing the event horizon (according to the video below; it's the same Bob than in the video: he cannot see Alice crossing the event horizon until ""t=infinity""), but Bob crosses the event horizon of blackhole B (not part of the video).  Let's say that the two blackholes are also falling to one another so let's say they are ""now"" (that concept is probably misplaced) merging. So the two event horizons now become one.  Are Alice and Bob reunited despite Bob never seeing Alice cross the event horizon of A? How would such situation (2 blackholes) be drawn using the diagram in the video in answer below?    This might be related to Do black hole singularities actually merge? and What happens to the information on the event horizons of two merging black holes? but I'm unable to get my answer from there... but I'm only a computer engineer, I'm not a physicist, so the answer might be lying there and I don't see it. "
3867,Can you see the starting and the ending of a light beam passing in the distance?,"This question arose to me when I saw a SciFi movie where they shot with laser guns and you clearly could see the dashes of light beams travelling from the shooter to the target. Nonsense of course, reality is much more boring.  But I wondered if you would just need more distance:    Given a limited light beam traveling from A to B, where ""limited"" means that there is a start and / or end of the emission source causing that beam. Given enough distance from us to A, B and the line between them And add some kind of nebular smoke in between just enough to disperse as much light as needed so we can see it here but not as much to prevent it from reaching B.   Couldn't we observe the starting and / or the ending of that light beam, progressing on it's way from A to B, like a jet trail in the sky?  If it is possible, where can this be observed? Or do the laws of physics forbid such a thing? "
3868,how far away can close stars diverge with time?,"Do high velocity stars decelerate if they transit at 300ly per million years? What kind of forces can decelerate them and in what kind of time frame?  What about ordinary stars which travel at 70 light years per million, i.e alpha centauri? How often do they change direction and do they end 1000ds of light years away after a billion years? "
3869,Fits file re-alignment,"I would like to re-align an image using a reference image (taken from GAIA). I am aware of the software Koords developed by the Karma team: [website]Unfortunately, the software crashes (with segmentation fault) everytime I try to add a source in either image. Is there a more up-to-date version of this tool? Or simply a different tool?  Update: Thank you for the responses! I will try to better explain exactly what I am trying to do :)  I have an X-ray image taken from Chandra and a GAIA-Aligned HST image. I know that the pointing for the X-ray image is off by ~.5 arcsec or so. I want  to re-align the X-ray image so that any X-ray point sources match their optical counter parts using the GAIA-Aligned HST image as my reference.  I hope this helps! "
3870,Is the eventual heat death of the universe due to the expansion of the universe?,"I am reading about the accelerating expansion of the universe and something struck me. The observation that things further away were accelerating away faster and that early observations made it look as though we were situated at the center of the universe.  Specifically, it seems as though the universe itself is expanding and not that the things within the universe were moving away from each other. Instead it seems as though the expansion itself is creating more space between the contents.  Recently I also saw an amazing video on the eventual death of everything in the universe. This seems weird to me because as I understand it energy and matter don't go away they just change.  And it got me thinking, what if this eventual heat death of the universe is simply this expansion eventually ripping everything apart until every particle simply is to far apart to interact.  Basically, as things progress the expansion will affect the contents of the universe even down to the particle level.  Is this the case? Or am I misunderstanding this subject? "
3871,wavelength-based IFU data cubes VS velocity-based IFU data cubes,"I have 2 simulated IFU data cubes of the same observation, let's say A and B. The 3rd dimension of cube A is in wavelengths. In order to create cube B I just rebinned cube A in log-wavelengths and then converted that to velocity (km/s). The rebinning to log-wavelength was necessary in order to convert the 3rd dimension of cube B in km/s. For an explanation see this:   Converting &#229;ngstr&#246;m spectral dimension to galaxy speed (km/s)  Now I want to apply instrumental broadening on both cubes. In order to do that, for each cube, I have to create a Gaussian profile with FWHM equal to the resolution of the instrument (or Line Spread Function, or LSF) and then convolve that with every spectrum of the cube. Of course the LSF of cube A will be in wavelengths while the LSF of cube B in km/s. Here is my question now:   Since all pixel shifts in cube A do not correspond to the same km/s value, one of the two LSFs won't be a perfect Gaussian, right? Shall I assume that would be the velocity LSF? What is the correct way of creating the velocity LSF? Do I just create a wavelength LSF and then rebin it to km/s, the same way I rebinned cube A to cube B? Does it worth the effort though? Will it make a difference? I have seen peer reviewed papers using velocity LSFs which are perfect Gaussians. Is this because the difference is negligible or my whole thinking/question is totally wrong?  "
3872,Typical wavelength of solar flare,"I read that solar flares are customarily viewed in H-alpha light, as a temporary brightening of a small portion of chromosphere.  What all can be interpreted from this? Is it because, energy of the radiation contained by the flare lies around this wavelength? And why chromosphere ? "
3873,Is it a star or something else,"I was lying down with my face up looking at the stars. Then I saw this star moving:   it was moving at one direction (just like airplane)  it's light was not blinking, just exactly as other stars both In color, brightness, size it took around 90 seconds before it disappeared from my view.    This happened in eastern Nigeria   What could it be? If it's a star what kind of star is that?  "
3874,"What's that very bright star (south-oriented, appearing at 5 p.m.)?","From my home I can see a very bright star (or a planet ?), appearing before 5pm local time, when I look toward South. It's really much more brighter than any other star, it's very often the only one you can see because of ambient light in the neighbourhood. It's even visible when it's a little bit cloudy.  Details:  My Location: N 50° 43.640' E 005° 41.430' (East of Belgium) Time : 5pm (4pm UTC), December 21st, 2016 Direction : Almost straight on South (190°) Altitude : 35°   Note that angles are rough estimates.  So, what's that star ? "
3875,antimatter annihilation in stars,Electrons annihilate with positrons produced through fusion processes in stars. Which particle interaction produces new electrons so that the sun isn't deplete of electrons? Or is something else happening altogether?  Regular fusion cycles in stars produce neutrinos and positrons as by products. Those positrons annihilate with electrons that are already there in the plasma of the star to produce the light that we eventually see. How are those electrons replaced? 
3876,Are there any to-scale diagrams of the TRAPPIST-1 system?,"Recommended to cross-post from SpaceEx: [website]I was recently told that the planets in TRAPPIST-1 are close enough together that you can see them from each other, as visible, discernible planets ""hanging in the sky"". i.e. much like the moon.  This assertion is compatible with this question: How many things are wrong in this &quot;artist view&quot; of the TRAPPIST-1 system?    I'm trying to understand the implications of the claim, and started by trying to find a to-scale astronomic diagram of some, or all, of the TRAPPIST-1 system, showing the star, the planets, their sizes and orbits, to scale.  Obviously such a diagram of the (Sol-Terra) Solar System would be completely useless - a few pixels in the centre, surrounded by a 8 other single-pixel-dots around the diagram.  But if the claim is true for TRAPPIST-1, then I would expect such a diagram to be actually ""usable"".  But I couldn't find such a diagram. Does one exist? "
3877,Where's the Prime Meridian of celestial coordinates,"...or what's the 'direction of vernal equinox'?  For both Ecliptic and Equatorial coordinate system, the Wikipedia article gives ""Primary direction (0° longitude)"" - ""Vernal Equinox"", linking to article on the event of the Equinox which never mentions any directions associated with it.  I guess the direction will be associated with the axis connecting the Sun and Earth during vernal equinox, but which direction of the line? Outward, with the meridian running opposite of the Sun, or inward, the meridian crossing the Sun at vernal equinox? Or maybe my guess is entirely wrong?  Generally, how would one go about converting celestial (ecliptic or equatorial) latitude to Earth latitude or vice versa - e.g. finding where on Earth an object of given celestial coordinates is in zenith at given time? The linked article has several formulas of converting between various celestial coordinate systems but either no conversion to Earth coordinates or I failed to understand some of the conversions. "
3878,"If Jupiter were to absorb all other planets in the solar system, would it reach degeneracy pressure?","Jupiter's mass is about the maximum a planet can be before it starts to fuse hydrogen in its core and undergo a massive transformation.   Total mass of all solar system objects in question is: here.  Jupiter is 1 Jupiter large, while the summation of all else is 0.405 Jupiter large.  Given the mass of Jupiter and the mass of all other planets, if Jupiter were to somehow collide and ""absorb"" all mass from every planet in the current solar system, would it turn into a star?  I guess that you can distill this question down to:  If Jupiter were 1.405x more massive, would it be a star?  Note: Still kind of new to these concepts, please explain misconceptions I may have. "
3879,Could Venus or Mercury have a moon that we haven't detected?,"Let's consider Mars' two moons for a moment. They're small, not even spherical, and most likely are captured asteroids. They weren't discovered until the late 1800's. Telescopes are much more powerful today, so you'd think we'd have found any similar moons at Venus or Mercury by now, if they exist.  The trouble is, there are some very dark asteroids out there. And of course, there are some much smaller ones too.  How do we know Venus or Mercury doesn't have a small dark asteroid moon? Did any probes actually try radar to find them? "
3880,Why wasn't there any oxygen in the beginning of the Earth?,"In the total beginning of the Earth there was CO2, N2 and H2O. So there was O2 but always in bond with Carbon and hydrogen, but what is the reason for that? Is O2 always reacting with free carbon atoms? The temperature of the Earth was is those beginning days around 1200degree Celsius. Is that also a factor of those bindings? "
3881,How does the earth's plane of orbit (ecliptic) vary over time?,Does the earth's orbital plane change with time relative to the distant stars? Does the Sun follow the same path through the zodiac (ignoring proper motions of the zodiacal stars)? 
3882,The big bang and our expanding universe,The Hubble telescope can see the light from the big bang.My question is if our universe is expanding that would make everything that's in front of our solar system be in the future? And also can Hubble see ahead of our solar system and does the bang big light ends behind our solar system? 
3883,Sky in the very far future / past,Motivated by this question about a stranded submarine in the Jurassic I would like to know:  Is there anything remotely left of our current skyline if we go back or forward millions of years so that the stars rotating around the milky way covered a measurable distance ? I would expect that the proper motion of a star causes an irreversible drift out of the original position. Are there any stabilizing factors which may allow that some star configurations are still discernible ? 
3884,Scientific evidence against CMB originating from “Oort Soup”?,"In this article (and references therein) the author claims that the Cosmic Background Radiation can be explained as black-body radiation originating from the cold bodies filling the interstellar space (which the author refers to as “Oort soup”).  As far as I know, the mainstream point of view is that CMB is an echo of the Big Bang which dates back to the electroweak symmetry breaking,and has cooled down since then due to the expansion of Universe.  This is the first time I learned about the alternative “Oort soup” hypothesis, which, according to the Author, also favors the Dark Matter model made of cosmic dust. I don’t have enough evidence to judge for myself whether it is pseudoscience or a valid alternative explanation of the CMB.  I would like to know what the position of the scientific community is — is the hypothesis considered pseudoscientific, or a valid (though maybe unlikely) alternative? What scientific evidence against the author’s hypothesis do we have? "

3887,Is normal matter always accompanied by dark matter and vice versa?,Is normal matter always accompanied by dark matter and dark matter by normal matter?  Was ever observed effect of gravity lensing without normal matter? 
3888,Is there an objective difference between space expansion and reduction in speed of light,"I just read an article about the cosmological model of an inflationary universe. As you probably know it basically states that space itself is subject to an expansion over time.  Since there is no moving matter or energy involved, this might even happen at a ""speed"" faster than light. So far, so good and obscure. What strikes me is the principle that the speed of light as a fundamental constant can only be expressed as a function of space-time. Where do we know that the one is constant but the other can suddenly be variable?  Is there any reason why the point of view of an expanding space is preferred over, say, a reduction in the speed of light or an increase in the ""speed"" of time? Is there any objective difference or is it just the good old rubber metaphor being stretched (pun intended) too far? "
3889,Best planets profile for a tattoo of the solar system,"I want to get a tattoo of the solar system. The gap between the planets should not be preserved and the differences in sizes will only be symbolic.   My question is if all planets were to align, do we know what side of the planets would be shown? If not, where can I find a profile picture of which side of the planet it will show? "
3890,How to track asteroids or NEOs?,"Fast-moving objects near our earth have different paths in the sky. They are different with stars far away.   For telescopes, when we do not know an object's orbit, catching up with its orbit and not losing it is a problem ? How to figure out a new object's orbit parameters quickly before we lose it? For an old object with an irregular orbit, can a telescope track it?   The typical speed in the asteroid belt may be smaller than 1""/min? But there may be faster objects. Then the paths are not so simple and regular. "

3893,How does a neutron star emitting magnetic-dipole radiation lose angular momentum?,"Is the ultimate reason that the neutron star loses angular momentum that the magnetic-dipole radiation is not spherically symmetric and photons have momentum?  Just for the loss of angular momentum, particles emitted from the neutron star surface are not necessary, right? "
3894,What Would it Look Like Inside Jupiter's Great Red Spot?,"From what I've read, Jupiter's 'Great Red Spot' is an unbelievably powerful storm. Do astronomers and scientists have any idea of what that might look like if it were possible to be inside/below it? Would it look like a storm on Earth (thunder, lightning, winds, etc.), or would it look completely different? "
3895,Is the universe considered to be flat?,"I've read various articles and books (like this one) stating that we are not certain about the geometry of the universe, but there were experiments on-going or planned that would help us find out.  Recently though, I've watched a lecture by cosmologist Lawrence Krauss where he seems to categorically assert that the universe has been proven to be flat by the BOOMERanG experiment. Here's the relevant portion of the talk.  I've looked around and there are still articles stating that we still don't know the answer to this question, like this one.  So, my question is two-fold:   Am I mixing concepts and talking about different things? If not then is this evidence not widely accepted by some reason? What reason would that be?  "
3896,Lack of objects between heliopause and Oort cloud?,"If we take a look at a logarithmic scale of the Solar System, there appears to be a large gap between the heliopause and the Oort cloud:   Why is that? There are some objects in the gap, but why are most of the Oort cloud objects in one area? Shouldn't it also fill the large gap in the picture just as much? "
3897,Where on Earth can moon rise on the meridian?," Somewhat related to this my picture showing only diurnal motion but Moon—seen from Earth—has a rapid motion with respect to the inertial celestial sphere, unlike stars and planets. Its motion relative to stars partially cancels the diurnal motion, and as the Moon’s orbit is inclined wrt Earth’s equator, Moon’s declination also changes and hence it can rise in 180°, 181°, 182°… or 360°, 359°, 358°… where objects moving only diurnally (such as stars and planets) cannot rise.  How far outside the polar circles can Moon rise in the Western celestial hemisphere or in north/south exactly? How is it best to see practically?    Also a meta request: where is a tag on astronomy.stackexchange about astronomy at high latitudes? "
3898,Is there any possible connection between Gamma Ray Burst and Fast Radio Bursts?,"The physical nature of Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs), a new type of cosmological transients discovered recently, is not known. It has been suggested that FRBs can be produced when a spinning supra-massive neutron star loses centrifugal support and collapses to a black hole.   Here we suggest that such implosions can happen in supra-massive neutron stars shortly (hundreds to thousands of seconds) after their births, and an observational signature of such implosions may have been observed in the X-ray afterglows of some long and short Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs).   Under this picture, a small fraction of FRBs would be physically connected to GRBs. Is there any possible connection between Gamma Ray Bursts and Fast Radio Bursts ?? "
3899,what is the net effect of nodal and apsidal lunar precession?,"In apsidal lunar precession, the moon's elliptic major axis precesses eastward and completes one revolution eastward in 8.85 years.  Because the orbit is inclined relative to the ecliptic, basic geometry dictates that the ascending and descending nodes must also rotate about the ecliptic at the same rate (all else constant.)  But then there's nodal precession, rotating the nodes in the opposite (west) direction, one revolution every 18.6 years.  So what is the net effect of these two precessions on the positions of the nodes? Subtract the two? "
3900,Good textbooks for a descriptive astronomy course,"Brief tale of woe  My department at a small public university in the US has decided to begin offering a descriptive astronomy general education course for the first time in a couple of decades and we have no institutional memory of how it was done before nor anyone on staff who's taught such a beast.  And I've been tapped to teach it.  Requirements  It's to be a one-semester course with three hours a week of classroom instruction and a three hour lab scheduled late enough that we'll have some dark sky early in the semester and more as the year goes on (schedule has it in Fall Semester). Expected enrollment in the neighborhood of 20 to 30. I won't have a teaching assistant unless I can rope a physics major into doing it somehow (we're an all undergrad department).  As a ""general education"" course mine will mostly attract students majoring in non-science subjects, biological science or human science. The students will have had enough math to know (in principle) how to isolate any variable in, say, the law of universal gravitation but many won't remember at first and some will resist; many will have chosen this class in an effort to avoid 'hard' classes like our gen ed chemistry, physics, or geology courses.  I'm looking of a textbook that touches on things like   Observational coordinate systems, familiarization with the night sky (constellations, I suppose), finding things The Earth moon system, phases, eclipses, maybe even tides Kepler's laws The planets, moons and other bits and pieces in the solar system The sun in particular and stars in general; including the birth, evolution and death of stars in a low math way Some observational stuff; parallax, standard candles, HR diagram ... A unit or integrated material on the planetary missions would be nice Larger scale structure of the universe; a cosmology unit wouldn't be out of place; how much dark matter (or worse dark energy) can actually be done? A unit on extra-solar planet hunting would be nice. A unit on other wavelengths? What else goes into a course like this?   Please include some detail on what is good about suggested texts and how well it matches with the course I've got to teach. What does it offer that's special?  Random detail  At this point we own a 8"" scope (reflector) with a axial mount and motor drive but no automated pointing and two pairs of decent binoculars (I can probably buy more binoculars, but additional scopes are probably out of budget for this).   It's been about 20 years since I pointed a scope up with my own hands, and my only ""real"" astronomical experience was doing some programming for a CCD backed 14"" remote-operated scope in the early 90s (we even managed to track a MACHO light curve and agree with the big boys, woo hoo science!).  The department head thinks that every gen. ed. course in our department should cover the scientific method and some thermodynamics which I think we can fit in.  I sincerely intend to include at least one field trip out to dark sky to just look up with adapted eyes. It's been too long...    The only question I could find on meta suggested that a sufficiently focused recommendation question would be accepted. If this is a no go, perhaps I'll pop into chat at some point. "
3901,A few questions regarding the transit of planets,"Here we will be concerning ourselves with the transit of a planet with it's parent sun.  I have a few questions that I am not sure about:  1) Do all planets transit their parent sun? It would seem to me that if all planets ""cross"" their parent star in some form, then depending on our point of view, we should be able to see the transits. For example, we never see a Mars transit, but if we alter our point of view to be farther then mars, then we would.  2) If all the planets are in the same orbital plane, would the transit of one, imply the transit of all the others? For example, our solar system is relevatily in the same plane, and it seems like Mercury/Venus transit, would also imply earth and beyond transits. We just have to be in right perspective.  3) If a planet transits its star, does the probability of a transit increase/decrease/same if planet semi major axis changes? I am not sure about this one. I still think that it would be 100% the fact that a transit will occur, but its more unlikely that we would ever see it, because we need our angle to be just right.  4) If a planetary system has multiple planets, would we detect transits from several planets if they are all in the same orbital plane, or if they have different orbital planes? This kind of builds off of #2, and I think the answer is the same orbital plane, because the ""different"" orbital planes could be such that are 90 degrees from our point of view, meaning we would never see the transit.  I want to know if my understanding of transits is correct by these questions. Thanks! "
3902,DIY tracking motor - gear mating,"I have a Skywatcher 130/900 and I found that if I do an accurate polar alignment I'll need only one motor to track a celestial body, so I decided to build my motor. Right now I'm facing a problem with the mating of the spur gear that drive the worm gear    Using a caliper I found that the gear has the outer diameter of 50mm, and a tooth is 1mm in height, so the reference diameter is 49mm; the gear has 140 teeth, and so the module (reference_diameter / n_of_teeth) is 0.35.  After this I used Solidworks to model a spur gear that could match it, and printed this    When I tried to check the mating, I found this    The teeth seems right, but they're too short and can't mate.  I used a caliper and counted the teeth to obtain the gear specs, and I think is kinda stupid as approach, but I could not think of something better to mate my gear. Is there a better approach to this?  Then, the idea was to try and remove the gear (removing the screw) and replace it with a 3d printed gear, but it does not seems to work (and I think it could break the telescope mount). Did someone try to do it?  Searching online I found that (obviously) there are some tracking motors and another question came to my mind: how can they mate the gear? Is there some kind of standard? Does it mean that every telescope's mount has some kind of standard gear? If yes, where can I found them?  EDIT: That's the situation: on the right there is the spur gear that I'm trying to mate (or eventually remove, if possible) and in the center there is the worm gear that move the telescope on the RA    EDIT2: Here's the project of an involute gear with Solidworks. (I followed this tutorial) but as you can see, the teeth overlap.     As a reminder, I have the following parameters     Pitch diameter (PD): 49mm (caliper measurement)   Number of teeth (Z): 140   Module (PD/Z): 0.35   Am I doing something wrong (or am I missing something)?

3903,Perihelion dates and parameters,"I have to find the perihelion and aphelion data for the 20th century for Earth. I found this table [website]I think it can be found using JPL Horizons web interface, but can not use the code (the boundaries of the task I was given) and do not want to check 36000+ entries by eye to find maximums and minimums: this is not the general way to solve the problem.   I believe that there is some relationship between  Keplerian elements and perihelion (argument of periapsis or mean anomally) but after checking the file from JPL Horizons I could not find any such relationship. Therefore, I have two questions:  1) Is there an archive with the dates of peryhelion and aphelion in the past?  2) What is the relationship between Keplerian elements and the perihelion (of course, if such exists)? Unfortunately, I was not able to find it from the picture on [website]"
3904,What accounts into calculating the Hubble constant?,"From my understanding, the Hubble constant [tex] calculates from observed redshifts [tex] of distant galaxys against their proper distance [tex]. The current value appears to be 67.80(77) [tex]  Calculating the Hubble constant via the redshift, I assume one only wants those velocity contributions due to the expansion of the universe, and not those from the real movement of the galaxies within in cluster (peculiar motion) or so. This, I also read in various online resources (which I can't recall right now).  On the other Hand, if your galaxy cluster is far enough away (eq. ~ 1 Gpc), one can neglect peculiar motion, which is in the order of 1000 [tex] (1000 [tex] / (1 Gpc [tex] 67.80(77) [tex]) [tex] 1.4%)  Nonetheless, how would you try to correct for the peculiar motion, or is it really just neglected? Calculating all the gravitational components in each cluster? Another idea could be to assume that the galaxies within the cluster move randomly in respect to each other and the peculiar motion cancels out over the average? Any other possibilities?  Note that this question is partly a copy of another question of mine at physics.stackexchange.com, which wasn't fully answered but commented to ask it here. "
3905,Age of a planetary body,We quote that the Earth is about 4 billion years old. However earth started with billions of cigarette smoke sized particles. What event or size or something do we use to say this is the start of Earth? Can we know how long the formation from dust to current size took? 
3906,Is the Earth going to evolve towards Mars' fate or Venus' fate?,"Upon reading on this site (and many others), one can think that Mars might have supported life in a distant past (discovery of liquid water, valleys, mountains...).   On the other hand, Venus is the perfect example of the consequences of the greenhouse effect. A planet where life is simply impossible because no heat can escape the planet's ultra-thick, CO2 filled atmosphere.  So, with a lot of exageration, one can say that both Mars and Venus could be the Earth's distant future.   Since the Earth is actually facing global warming and greenhouse effect, I was wondering if the Earth would one day be like Venus ? Or if it is going to be like Mars, with no more magnetosphere and almost no atmosphere left ? Or if it is not going anywhere near those two planets' fate ?  "
3907,What will future populations of stars be like?,"As stars slowly using up hydrogen and ejecting heavier elements into space, the future stars will form from nebulae that are more metal and helium rich.  The question is: how does the increased ratio of helium and metals affect star formation and stellar evolution?  Does more helium and metals in the core at the beginning means the star begins it's life in an advanced state so it dies faster? "

3909,How does the Sun orbit the Sun-Jupiter Barycenter?,"I got the Orbital Elements of Jupiter around the Sun, which describe how it orbits relative to the ""fix"" Sun.  Jupiter Semi Major Axis (AU): 5.20336301  Eccentricity: 0.04839266  Inclination to Ecliptic Plane (deg): 1.30530  Longitude of the Ascending Node (deg): 100.55615  Longitude of Perihelion (deg): 14.75385  Mean Anomaly at J2000.0 (deg): 19.65053  I want to convert this One-Body Problem back into the Two-Body Problem to find out where the Sun is gonna be at a given time (i couldnt find the Orbital Elemens of Sun around Sun-Jupiter Barycenter).    So the Semi-Major Axis depends on the Mass Ratio. The Eccentricity and Inclination should be equal for both, just like Longitude of the Ascending Node. The Longitude of Perihelion should be the one from Jupiter+180°, doesnt it?  The main Problem is the Mean Anomaly at J2000.0. The two Ellipses are equal, besides of the Size. Thus, the True Anomaly at a given time should be the same for Each Coordinate System. Then the eccentric Anomaly will be the same too. Does that mean the Mean Anomaly for J2000.0 will be also the same for both?  Thanks for reading and sunny greetings!!   "
3910,Why argon instead of another noble gas?,"I noticed that the atmospheres of Earth and Mars have a little bit of argon in them (1% to 2%). I checked Venus, too, which has 0.007% argon, but that's still more than any other noble gas in the Venusian atmosphere.  I checked the 4 outer gas planets, plus the moon Titan, and for the most part could not find Argon listed in their atmospheric composition. Jupiter is listed as having a very tiny trace amount of Argon that is hard to interpret because it's listing it as relative to helium and then relative to Jupiter/Sun, whatever that means. The moon Titan is listed as having trace argon without specifying any numbers. The others did not mention Argon.  So why do the rocky planets tend to have argon, but the gaseous planets don't?  Why argon specifically? Presumably helium is too light and will float to the top and get knocked away by the solar wind. However, there is one noble gas between helium and argon, namely, neon. So why don't we have neon in our atmosphere instead of argon?  Edit: Maybe the outer planets do have Argon, but it all sank to the bottom and thus we don't detect it? I'm also curious about where Argon lies in the ""food chain"" of nuclear fusion for an average star like our Sun. I have a hard time seeing how Argon-40 would be more populous than Neon-20 though. "
3911,Why can I see the Andromeda Galaxy despite Milky Way's rotation?,"Okay ... so, I woke up from a dream last night wherein I was (apparently) attempting to devise a time-keeping system for interstellar travel (similar to the stardate system used in Star Trek). In the dream, I was attempting to correlate our current calendar, based on Earth's movements relative to the sun, with this fictitious calendar using the positions of intergalactic stellar bodies in comparison to Milky Way. (i.e., What if we could tell time based on the way other galaxies moved in relation to our own galaxy?)  So, in the dream, I was understanding that Milky Way is a spiral galaxy which rotates around a galactic center. That Earth is toward the middle-end of one arm of Milky Way's spirals. That almost every star we see in the night sky is inside Milky Way with us, and that the galaxy Andromeda is a great distance beyond Milky Way and can be seen in the night sky over Earth in the same location (between constellations Cassiopeia and Pegasus) every night since (at least) 10th century C.E.    Assuming Milky Way was graphed on a flat sheet of paper with the Galactic Center plotted at X=0,Y=0, and the arm which contains Earth was located at X=0,Y=-δ, and also assuming the galaxy Andromeda can be seen in earth's sky from this position ... why then, when Milky Way rotates around it's galactic center so that the arm which contains Earth is located at X=+δ,Y=0 (a rotation of 90°), or even X=0,Y=+δ (a rotation of 180°) is the galaxy Andromeda still visible in the same location in the sky?  Unless the galaxy Andromeda is in some sort of galactic-synchronous orbit with Milky Way (which seems unlikely since most of the posts referencing Andromeda here deal with the collision of the two galaxies), then, in the in either of the second rotational positions listed above, Andromeda should no longer be visible.  What am I missing? Why does Andromeda, which is not a part of Milky Way, only move in the night sky in relation to Earth's seasons and not in relation to any other galactic movement? "
3912,Is it true dark matter was discovered whilst looking at the rotational speed of galaxies?,"Just a little something whilst a dark matter pioneer moves onto a better place.   This commentator writes:     My understanding is that dark matter was ""discovered"" when trying to find out why stars in the outer edge of a galaxy rotates with the same speed as the inner. A ten-fold increase in number of galaxies doesn't seem to affect this.   When reading the history - this simple explanation doesn't quite come across. Perhaps the statement above is oversimplified. For example:   mass in the galactic plane must be greater than what was observed (doesn't quite talk about comparative rotational velocity) estimated its mass based on the motions of galaxies near its edge (doesn't quite talk about comparative rotational velocity) some unseen matter provided the mass and associated gravitation attraction to hold the cluster together (doesn't quite talk about comparative rotational velocity) measurements of galaxy rotation curves (what is a galaxy rotational curve? Shouldn't it be a straight line if they're rotating at the same angular velocity?) gravitational lensing of background objects by galaxy clusters (not talking about comparative rotational velocity?)   My question is: Is it true dark matter was discovered whilst looking at the rotational speed of galaxies? "
3913,"Compared with similar stars, does the sun itself have properties that make life on Earth possible?","We often hear our solar system has properties for life. For example, it is far away from the center of Galaxy. It has Jupiter far away to protect us from asteroids. It has optimum size of territorial planets, plate activity on Earth, and so on.  But besides that, compared with similar stars, does our sun itself also have properties that make life possible? For example, does it have extra stable brightness? Or does it emit less high energy radiation? "
3914,"How would a celestial map for Callisto depict the paths of Jupiter, the Sun, etc.?","Let's say we're mapping Callisto's northern celestial hemisphere in a way similar to this map of Earth's.  Along with the stars (which let's just ignore for this question), this map will identify the paths of four objects:   The Sun Jupiter Ganymede (closer to Jupiter) Himalia (farther from Jupiter)   Where on the map would these objects' paths be? Or at least how would I find the exact answers with math/software/etc.?  My assumptions/guesses:   Jupiter's path is relatively similar to the ecliptic but Callisto's orbital inclination or maybe Jupiter's might separate the two Jupiter's moons are within a similar orbital plane to Callisto and would follow near Jupiter's path the distance Callisto travels away from the sun in its own orbit is insignificant in determining the shape of the ecliptic   I have no idea if the axial tilt of Callisto or Jupiter would affect anything but it probably does.  If it helps, I've made this incredibly stylish and oh-so-fabulous template in case anyone wants to sketch it in Paint or something. The black dot at the center is the celestial north pole.

3915,How to adapt small Dobsonian to use with a tripod?,"I am the owner of a small 4"", f/6.3 tabletop Dobsonian telescope with a 102mm aperture and 640mm focal length.   It is based on a Dobsonian mount but I would like to use a tripod instead because of the complications of having to cary a table with me everywhere I would like to use the telescope. The alternative is to but the telescope on the ground which makes viewing uncomfortable and is not very stable.  A good tripod could be foldable or collapsible and make my rig much more portable and bring the eyepiece up to a more convenient viewing height, without having to bring along a ""telescope table"".   Is this possible? If so, are there any specific tripods I should use or other pointers on how best to proceed?    This is not me or my telescope or mount, but it gives an idea of viewing with a similarly-sized tabletop telescope. I'd like to mount the telescope on a tripod instead.    Source "
3916,Why do planets tend to rotate in the same direction although they have formed from tumbling asteroids?,"The axial tilts of asteroids seem to vary randomly (let me know if this premise is wrong), while the planets have a strong tendency to rotate in the same way. If planets were formed by colliding asteroids, shouldn't the sum of random tilts result in random planetary rotation? Of course other factors are important, like angle and velocity of impacts, YORP-effect, centrifugal breakup and whatnot, but how could that taken together have any systematic effect on rotation?  Ceres does behave with 4° tilt, but the other of the first discovered asteroids have tilts like 84°, 50°, 42°. Dust particles (and gas molecules if applicable) surely rotate randomly. The Solar nebula had a net spin which gravity and friction has manifested in the orbits of the planets. But shouldn't the netting of rotation be individual for each planet, with uncorrelated tilts, as orbital orientation is for each star? "
3917,Determining latitude and longitude in bad weather,"In Sobel's famous book 'Longitude', she described the story of Harrison. I still have one question. What if it is cloudy on the sea?

It seems that the problem is not so satisfactorily solved.  "
3918,What parameters cause sunburn?,"I am new to this site so if the question doesn't fit in this forum feel free to remove it.  I have read here [website]  ([tex]) The time of day. In most locations, the sun's rays are strongest between approximately 10am and 4pm daylight saving time.      ([tex]) Cloud cover. UV is partially blocked by clouds; but even on an overcast day, a significant percentage of the sun's damaging UV radiation can pass through clouds.      ([tex]) Proximity to reflective surfaces, such as water, sand, concrete, snow, and ice. All of these reflect the sun's rays and can cause sunburns.      ([tex]) The season of the year. The position of the sun in late spring and early summer can cause a more-severe sunburn.      ([tex]) Altitude. At a higher altitude it is easier to become burnt, because there is less of the earth's atmosphere to block the sunlight. UV exposure increases about 4% for every 1000 ft (305 m) gain in elevation.      ([tex]) Proximity to the equator (latitude). Between the polar and tropical regions, the closer to the equator, the more direct sunlight passes through the atmosphere over the course of a year. For example, the southern United States gets fifty percent more sunlight than the northern United States.   My question is, can we compose ([tex]), ([tex]) and ([tex]) into one statement: ""Height of sun over the horizon""?   Wikipedia seems to hint that we can since it says:     Regardless of one's latitude (assuming no other variables), equal shadow lengths mean equal amounts of UV radiation.   However, the statement is kind of vague and I would like confirmation.  Another doubt I have regarding this is experience. I live in Europe where solar noon is at 1pm during summer and the day is longest on June 21 (or 22, whatever). But, people seem to get way more sunburn in, say, August 21 than in April 21, and also more at 4pm than at 10am (regardless of the month). It is also hotter in August than in April and at 4pm than at 10am. So it might be that people simply spend more time out because it's hotter and therefore get more sunburn, but it also might be that the temperature affects our skin somehow and we do get more sunburn when it's hotter.  So, taking clouds, reflective surfaces and altitude out of equation, is it true that sunburn is caused just by the height of the sun above horizon? If I spend 5 minutes at some place on a sunny day at noon in April, will I get the same amount of sunburn as I would at 3pm in June? (given that the sun is at the same height over the horizon at that times, and that 5 minute span is short enough to approximate that sun stays ""fixed"" in the sky)  My intuition says it should be true that height over horizon is the only parameter that should matter, but my experience shows different. Moreover, if I am correct, is there some graph/table showing how much intensity (or some other unit?) of sunburn I get with respect to height of sun? (say at zero altitude on a sunny day without reflective surfaces, or at some other, fixed, reference configuration). "
3919,Who found the existence of Dark Matter?,"Dark Matter's observational evidence is widely attributed to Vera Rubin based on her observation of galaxy rotation curves with Kent Ford in 1970s, which was later confirmed by Albert Bosma in 1978.   However, it was in the late 1930s that Fritz Zwicky inferred the presence of dark matter based on his observations of Coma galaxy cluster using the virial theorem. Herein lies my confusion. Why does the scientific community and people, in general, give credits to Vera Rubin instead of Zwicky for inferring/observing the evidence for dark matter? Or, is the recognition given because she independently strengthened Zwicky's observation thereby confirming the existence of dark matter? "
3920,Red dwarf variation in Luminosity,I recently saw this video. The creator of the video says that one of the reasons for non-existence of life on planets around red dwarfs might be that these stars can increase luminosity roughly by a factor of 2 in a matter of seconds which will boil off water from planets. He also said something about Helium/Hydrogen convection belts which are responsible for this. Can someone please explain this phenomenon?

Do astronomers really have data that confirms the 'new ninth' planet?

My question is do astronomers believe this is sufficient to confirm it that there is a planet.  "

Escape velocity of Earth is around 11.2 km/s. Yet I can lift weights up say one meter even at slower speed, say one meter per second.   Next, consider me hovering one meter above event horizon. As far as I know, for non-rotating BH this is totally possible. Similar to earth, I could lift weight up one meter at speed less than escape velocity (which at this point is speed of light minus x).   Now, I’m hovering one meter below the event horizon. Would I not be able to lift the weight up one meter at speed less than escape velocity (which at this point is speed of light plus y; not sure if x and y are equal), or would I not be able to hover at this position?

3928,Non-Newtonian motion of the moon,"I watched an interesting excerpt from a BBC show on the work of the McDonald Observatory in its laser measurements of the distance to the moon which are apparently accurate to within a few centimeters. The observatory used to make a measurement every day and by this means a plot of the Moon's orbit around the earth was obtained over a period of approximately 40 years from about 1970 to about 2010.  At the end of the excerpt Dr. Peter Shelus says that the measurements show that the shape of the moon's orbit is not quite as expected by ""Newton's"" theories, which I interpreted to mean that the orbit is non-Keplerian, but possibly he meant something else. It is hard to know because the excerpt just cuts off mid-sentence, so it is unclear what he was saying exactly.  In what way is the orbit of the moon irregular according to the MacDonald measurement series?  Also, as an aside, I notice that the observatory's funding was cut in 2009 so that these measurements are no longer being made, but two other observatories are making new series. Are these other observatories making daily measurements the way the MacDonald Observatory used to do? "

3940,"If earth changed its orbit, what would happen to the moon?","Let there be an accelerating force acting on earth over an arbitrarily long time to change its orbit around the sun (e.g. by asteroids repeatedly passing by close to earth (intentional or not) or whatever). For this question consider only the effect of earth's gravity on the moon (and vice versa), not other influences (e.g. not the immediate effect the asteroids passing by have on the moon's orbit).  If such perturbations are weak enough yet of sufficient duration to change earth's orbit around the sun, how does it change the moon's orbit around earth? My considerations:    Since the moon remains in orbit around earth even as the earth goes around the sun there obviously is some lower limit to how fast earth can accelerate. However, that force wanders around earth once a year, hence its effect on the moon's orbit is evening out - and the effects from the sun are supposed to be ignored here, anyway, so let's have the force go in a constant direction.  The force acting on earth can be decomposed into [tex] perpendicular to and [tex] coplanar with the moon's orbital plane. [tex] moves earth out of the plane of the moon's current orbit, so the moon's orbit will adjust to find a new plane: if the force is continuously applied in the same direction the moon's orbit will change until [tex], so this factor can be neglected.  [tex] will cause the moon's orbit to become very elliptical, the moon passing closer on the side toward which earth is accelerated and being further away on the other side. If the force is indefinitely sustained something will happen to the moon, but under which circumstances will which scenario happen?   the moon remains in orbit, the moon gets tidally torn apart, the moon crashes into earth, the moon leaves orbit of earth (though the moon will probably say that it's earth which ran away...), anything else interesting I forgot.

3941,"(Thought experiment) if we put a huge mirror into space, could we see back in time to the big bang?","This is an addition to this question which is closed:  By putting a mirror in space, would we be able to see into the past?  Imagine there is a supernova a hundred years ago. Lots of people see it but nobody has a decent telescope. A hundred years later we point a powerful telescope in the opposite direction, and find a huge alien mirror a hundred light years away, that allows us to watch the supernova.  My question is, what is the limit of such a technique?  Could we see right back to the big bang if the mirror was large enough and far enough away?  Please note this is not a question about whether the telescope or mirror are realistically possible. Assume we are using some superior alien technology. "
3942,Would two Earth-like planets on opposite sides of a Sol-like star at about 1 AU be a stable configuration?,"Would two Earth-like planets on opposite sides of a Sol-like star at about 1 AU be a relatively stable configuration? I understand that there are tadpole-like orbits and the two planets may not stay exactly opposite each other, but oscillate around those position.  But given perturbations from other planets, say a Jupiter-like one at say 5 AU, might they eventually crash into each other, or would one end up moving to a higher orbit and the other to a lower orbit? "
3943,"Can lunar atmospheric density, as it exists today, increase naturally?","Are there any mechanisms which could increase the density of the moon's atmosphere.  The moon's existing atmosphere is exceeding rare, with about 1 000 000 molecules of gas per cubic centimeter at the surface, ten trillion times less than the Earth.   The source of this gas is the impact of solar wind on the moon's surface, and some outgassing from the interior of the moon.   Can this density vary significantly? Could it reach a density comparable to Earth's? Are there natural processes which could cause the atmospheric density to increase, either in the short term, or over a longer time span. "

3947,"Moon is a planet by ""Clearing the neighborhood"" condition?","Whether the Moon (Earth's natural satellite) is a planet is an old debate in planetary science. Though I do not agree that Moon is a planet, I found something difficult to clearly understand.  According to the 2006 IAU definition of planet, a planet must satisfy Clearing the neighbourhood condition. And some criteria for the condition are introduced in the Wikipedia article about Clearing the neighbourhood.   Stern–Levison's [tex]   [tex]   Margot's [tex]   [tex]  In the above equations, [tex] is the mass of the body, [tex] is the body's semi-major axis, and other factors are described in the Wikipedia article. Both criteria are said to be satisfied if the calculated value is greater than 1.  My calculations are simple. Let [tex] and Moon's other factors (such as [tex], [tex] and [tex]) have the same values as Earth's. Then I can get...  [tex]  [tex]  Both [tex] and [tex] thus satisfy the Clearing the neighbourhood condition. Though I do not calculate the Soter's [tex], it will not change my results.  What is wrong with my calculations and results? Do I miss something about the condition and the criteria? Or is there something wrong with the Clearing the neighbourhood condition?    Edit in response to comments:  This question can be related to the idea that the Clearing the neighborhood condition is inadequate and ambiguous for the planet definition. More deeply, this question can be related to the idea that 2006 IAU definition of planet is logically ambiguous and clumsy. For example, the 2006 definition of planet defines the Moon as a satellite and not a planet. If one celestial body can be defined as a planet or not without rules and conditions, why other conditions are needed? All we need is just a planet list, not other planet conditions.  And...  Frankly speaking, the Clearing the neighborhood condition is like comedy.  The condition says ""Planet must sweep out other bodies"" ... Then says ""Except satellites"" ... Then again says ""Except bodies having no significant size"" ... Then again ""Except bodies having resonant orbit"" ... Then again ""It may take billions of years"" ... Then again ""Sweep-out process and time are influenced by other planets and bodies, actually"" .......  It is obvious that sometimes the Clearing the neighborhood theory is useful. But it is inappropriate for the rule and definition requiring strictness. "
3948,What makes scientists already so certain that Comet C/2019 Q4 (Borisov) is a comet and not an asteroid?,"US Naval Research Laboratory scientist Dr. Karl Battams has recently tweeted     Unlike 'Oumuamua, whose asteroid-or-comet nature still gets debated, this one is definitely a comet. If it is unequivocally interstellar, it'll be fascinating to see how its composition (spectral properties) compare to the variety we see in comets from our own solar system.   Answers to Do astronomers generally agree that the distinction between comets and astroids is not so clear? suggest that the distinction can be a hard call sometimes, and some might instead call small solar system bodies formerly known as Prince comets and asteroids just that; SSSBs.  Question: What might cause astronomers like Dr. Battams be so confident that this object is a comet and not an asteroid, besides the fact that it's being called one? (Comet C/2019 Q4 (Borisov))  Is it just the orbit itself, or are there other observational data such as brightness in the infrared?  "
3949,Sun's orbital elements,"I have the orbital elements of an asteroid's heliocentric motion (the orbit has non-zero inclination and is elliptical). But I want to simulate the motion of the sun around the asteroid. So without having the sun's ephemeris, and given only the asteroid's orbital elements, how can I determine an equivalent orbital elements for the sun's motion around the asteroid?  Edit: I realize that the question wasn't clear enough based on the comment. So, what I am trying to do is to numerically solve the two body problem equation in the inertial frame. In the classic two-body problem 2nd order ODE, in my case, the position vector is defined from the centre of the asteroid to the sun, which is absolutely valid and upon integration gives me the position an velocity for the sun with respect to an inertial frame centred at the asteroid. My question is concerned with the initial conditions to begin the numerical integration. As of now I determine the initial state vector for the Sun from some random orbital elements. But to perform a more realistic simulation, Is it possible to determine the real orbital elements for the asteroid-centric motion of the Sun from a given set of orbital elements of a heliocentric-motion of the asteroid? I hope I was clear and not made this more confusing.  "
3950,Is there a place in the known universe that there would be no visible light from other stars/galaxies?,"Is there a place in the universe where, with the naked eye, you wouldn't see any stars, galaxies or light emitting phenomena?

Not sure what the appropriate tags to put on this question. Feel free to add/change tags as needed.  "
3951,Why is Proxima Centauri called Proxima Centauri?,"It seems very logical, to call the star, closest to earth, ""Proxima"" (""Proximus"" is Latin for ""close"" and the word for star, ""stella"", is feminin, hence ""Proxima""), but there's one thing I don't understand: in order to call a star ±""The closest one"", you must be sure that in future, no closer star will be found. This is not so simple: lots of very close stars, like Barnard's star, Kapteyn's, ..., are very weak and even not visible to the naked eye. So, how can we be that sure that Proxima is indeed the nearest one? Have astronomers indeed examined the complete sky in order to prove this? "
3952,Is there a significant population of neutron stars outside the galactic plane?,"Pulsar kicks originating from supernovae can impart neutron stars with speeds of 100-500 km/s, often at or close to the escape velocity of the Milky Way. Even if a pulsar fails to escape the galaxy, it can be launched into unusual orbits. Assuming that the velocity distribution is isotropic, a decent fraction of such pulsars should have large orbital inclinations after the kicks, such that they rise above the galactic plane.  I have two questions regarding this:   Is there a large - i.e. noticeable - population of such neutron stars, distinguishable by modern telescopes, or is the fraction of total neutron stars relatively small? Does observing a pulsar - at any wavelength - in such an orbit have any advantages over observing an identical pulsar firmly in the galactic disk? I would assume that some kicks could propel them high enough that scattering along the line of sight could be lessened, leading to a smaller dispersion measure smearing, and could also isolate the pulsars from ambient radio sources in the disk, such as a the galactic center.   I understand that ""noticeable"", at the least, is a bit subjective, but I can't come up with any non-arbitrary criteria to change that. "
3953,Why does the traslation movement of the earth last the same time as the four seasons?,Why does the traslation movement of the earth last the same time as the four seasons? The seasons could take 100 days or 200 or 20 years (aprox. like in GoT)... but exactly (exactly???) 1 year. Why?  Edit: I think that I need to redefine the question. I define a year as the full traslation movement of the earth around the sun. And the four seasons as the full movement of the perpendicular axis from 0 to 23.5 to 0 again to -23.5 to 0 again. Why do these two movements take the same time? 
3954,Why does the outside edge of a Kerr black hole ergosphere rotate at the same speed as the inner edge?,"Reading through the Wikipedia on a Kerr black hole ergosphere, and this nice question on the maximal spin rate of a black hole leads me to ask: why does the outer edge of the ergosphere rotate at the same rate as the inner edge?   Imagine I'm flying into a spinning black hole and haven't yet crossed into the ergosphere. Space-time is rotating more and more as I approach the black hole. I'm rotating at 90% the speed of light, then 91% etc. until I cross into the outer edge of the ergosphere and am rotating at 100% the speed of light. My question is, how does this continue at exactly 100% for a while before I enter the Schwartzschild radius and fall in for good?   My intuition would be that rotation would be a continuous smooth function, rather than a 'step' function where there's a zone where I'm getting closer to the black hole, but not rotating any faster. Where is the extra energy going? "
3955,How do we know that black holes are spinning?,"How is it possible to know if a black hole is spinning or not?  If a planet is spinning, you can see it clearly but you can't really see a black hole.  Next thing would be that matter interacts with adjacent matter and we could see in which direction the matter surrounding the BH spins (like if you spin a ball on water, the water around would spin too in the same direction) but matter can't interact from inside the event horizon to the outside, so matter right at the event horizon would just be interacting with gravity (like the BH has no friction).  Now gravity. I would think that you could measure the differences in gravity if a large object is not perfectly uniform but I think a BH has the same gravitation pull on all sides.  What am I missing here? How can one even detect or determine by observation that a black hole is spinning, or better yet, measure how fast? "

3958,How accurate and complete is the Hubble sequence diagram?,"The Hubble sequence sorts and characterizes or classifies galaxies by their shape. It was suggested by Edwin Hubble back in 1926.  One drawback, or criticism, of this scheme is that Hubble had a limited data set of galaxies at hand, compared to today's data. He ""only"" had a few hundred galaxies in visible light from which he could build the sequence.  So, adding today's knowledge of way more galaxies imaged in all different kinds of spectra how correct is Hubble's scheme? Is it skewed because of this originally limited selection of data? Are there other shapes missing in the sequence? "

3962,Does Arecibo's secondary optics compensate aberrations when viewing farther away from vertical?,"In the beginning of the short YouTube video Arecibo Uncut: Under the Dish with Phil Perillat it is mentioned that while dish antennas are usually a parabola, the problem is that a static parabola would only be useful to see objects for a few minutes as they passed overhead.     But then some guy at DARPA says ""Hey why don't you guys make it a sphere?"" A sphere has the unique property that from the center of curvature, no matter where you look, it's the same.   That is indeed how the Arecibo dish works; a static primary sphere and a big, funny-looking secondary mirror and associated optics/electronics suspended above on cables that can be moved around in order to ""point"" in different directions.  Two questions:   While the statement in the block quote about the sphere is correct as far as it goes, is the shape of the correcting optics (secondary, etc) above also independent of where you look? Or ideally would you like a different secondary shape depending on how far off-vertical you look? If so, is this what happens? Any ideas who ""the guy at DARPA"" might be?  "

3965,Estimate prevalence of ʻOumuamua-style interstellar obects inside Jupiter orbit now that C/2019 Q4 (Borisov) is found?,"Now we know two of them, so maybe it's not an outlier.  We have two points so we can draw a line. How many similar macroscopic objects should be zipping through space at ~30 km/sec so that we would see one of these passing inside the orbit of Jupiter once every two years? I don't really know what units this should be expressed with. Maybe it's 1 / (km^2 * year)  - the frequency of such a body coming through any random square kilometer of empty space in a year of time.  What's the ""capture cross section"" of intra-Jupiter orbit? I imagine that since the Sun affects trajectories of bodies coming near it, drawing them closer as they pass by, intra-Jupiter orbit will see much more bodies than a circle of same area in empty space. How large is this effect for ʻOumuamua-like bodies? I expect this is to be a unitless coefficient. Is it neligible? Is it 5x? 10x? 1000x?  Sorry if my question is not clear enough. "
3966,What is the exact mass of the Sun?,"I am having trouble finding data on this.

The second value can be found from Wikipedia in (at least) two places.   The first Wikipedia occurence references the GSFC page--which is erroneous since that value does not occur there. The second Wikipedia occurence references USNO's 2014 Astronomical Constants, which appear to themselves be copy-pasted from data in 2009 or 2012.  The second Wikipedia occurrence also sources NIST (presumably this table).  I couldn't find the cited mass from either reference.  The third (and also the fifth) value (which, it is interesting to note, are both outside the error bound given in the second Wikipedia occurrence) can be found on this generic NASA site. The fourth value occurs in the book Handbook of Chemistry and Physics (Robert C. Weast, 1980) The fifth value apparently also occurs in the book Astrophysical Data (Kenneth R. Lang, 1990ish). The sixth value occurs in the book Physics--3rd Edition (Cutnell et al. 1995).  This site lists several of the values and does a calculation to obtain the sixth value. Occurs in many places and is pretty clearly rounded.   The fifth, sixth, and seventh values (also) occur in various non-primary sources online, and I assume are rounded values of others.  My question: what is the most recent, best estimate, to the greatest precision, of the Sun's mass?  Obviously, citable, primary sources only! "

I give lessons about renewable energy and it would be nice to somehow integrate a telescope (PST Coronado + double stack) to the chapter about photovoltaics and solar thermal energy.   Right now, the only ""experiment"" I could come up with was to show that there's often nothing to see because of the solar minimum. But we also wouldn't see any feature if the telescope was not focused or not well calibrated. With some luck, it should be possible to follow the movement of a sunspot over a few days and estimate how fast the sun is rotating, possibly at different latitudes. I suppose that in order to calculate many sun characteristics, it is mandatory to know the average distance between Earth and the Sun. It seems to be relatively hard to estimate 1 AU.   Is it possible to use the telescope for any experiment and estimate an order of magnitude for any of the Sun characteristics, assuming that the distance to the Sun is approximately 150 000 000km? "

3973,Help understanding the false MRO observations of hydrated minerals on Mars,"The Science News article An orbiter glitch may mean some signs of liquid water on Mars aren’t real begins:     Some signs of water on Mars may have just dried up.      Thanks to the way data from NASA’s Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter are handled, the spacecraft may be seeing signs of hydrated salts that aren’t really there, planetary scientists report online November 9 in Geophysical Research Letters.      That lack of salts could mean that certain sites proposed as places where life could exist on Mars today, including purported streaks of liquid water on the walls of Martian craters, are probably dry and lifeless.      “People think these environments might be inhabitable by microbes,” says planetary scientist Ellen Leask of Caltech. But “there might not actually be any real evidence for it,” at least not from orbit.      Leask and her colleagues found the problem while searching for hydrated salts called perchlorates in maps of Mars taken by the orbiter’s Compact Reconnaissance Imaging Spectrometer for Mars, or CRISM. Perchlorates can lower the freezing point of water by up to 80 degrees Celsius, which could be enough to melt ice in the frigid Martian climate.   The report is Open Access in Geophysical Research Letters: Challenges in the Search for Perchlorate and Other Hydrated Minerals with 2.1‐μm Absorptions on Mars Leask, E. K., Ehlmann, B. L., Dundar, M. Murchie, S. L. Seelos, F. P., [website]The data in question comes from Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter's CRISM (Compact Reconnaissance Imaging Spectrometer for Mars), a Vis-NIR push broom hyperspectral imager, where a 1D line image is cross-dispersed in wavelength and recorded on a 2D array as the spacecraft moves over Mars' surface.  If I understand correctly, during later image analysis and , some of the corrections to the data meant to compensate for ""spikes"" in some observables (despiking) occurring during large changes in brightness resulted in spectral features that suggested presence of hydrated minerals that didn't exist.  Question: But I find the description of the step in the analysis responsible for the error a little bit complicated. Is it something simple like division by very small values leading to the spike in a derived quantity, followed by heavy-handed interpolation to smooth it over? What exactly does it mean when they talk about a few pixels, are there some physical locations on the detector that behave differently, or a spectral hot spot from artifacts in the grating? (e.g. Woods anlomalies)? “But for 0.05 percent of the pixels, it smooths out in a way that looks like perchlorate.”  Potentially helpful resource: Regularization of Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter CRISM along‐track oversampled hyperspectral imaging observations of Mars  Any help translating the ""processingese"" language to something easier to understand for a non-astronomer would be a great help!  More from the Science News article:     CRISM’s camera doesn’t work perfectly, though. It can be thrown off by boundaries between light and dark, like a shadowed region at the edge of a cliff. Some pixels in the orbiter’s camera take a fraction of a millisecond to realize the surface color changed, so they record an extra spot of light or dark where it shouldn’t be. Planetary scientists have software to correct for these “spikes” in the spectra and make the data more reliable and easier to read.      But the correction sometimes introduces dips in the spectra at the same wavelengths as perchlorates, Leask and Ehlmann and their colleagues found. “We cleverly created a way to get rid of the spiky noise,” Ehlmann says. “But for 0.05 percent of the pixels, it smooths out in a way that looks like perchlorate.”      The researchers found the glitch while looking for small signs of the salts in CRISM images. Assuming that the orbiter would have already spotted large deposits of perchlorates if they existed, the team wrote an algorithm to find smaller traces that covered fewer than 10 pixels in a CRISM image. And the scientists started seeing perchlorates everywhere, including Jezero crater, which NASA announced was selected as the landing site for the Mars 2020 rover on November 19 (SN Online: 11/19/18).       © 2018 American Geophysical Union.

3975,speed of light measurement,"While searching for different methods of speed of light measurement, i came across one of the method of fizeau discussed below which i cannot fully understand.  In short,in Fizeau’s apparatus, a beam of light was shone between the teeth of a rapidly rotating toothed wheel, so the “lantern” was constantly being covered and uncovered. Fizeau had a mirror, reflecting the beam back, where it passed a second time between the teeth of the wheel.   I do understand the idea i.e. to measure the time during the course of light ""from the wheel to mirror and then back to the mirror"".But where are the mirror,lantern and wheel  located? What kind of wheel is that? Does light pass through the holes (or teeth) in the wheel or light gets refracted through the wheel? Finally if a group of light particles goes through one of the hole (or teeth),then how do we know that the same group of light particles came back through which hole (or teeth) after its journey,since there are soo many light particles leaving and entering different holes (or teeth)?

3977,Is cosmic shear generally agreed to have been observed?,"A review by Martin Kilbinger, 2015 says:     Cosmic shear is the distortion of images of distant galaxies due to weak gravitational lensing by the large-scale structure in the Universe. Such images are coherently deformed by the tidal field of matter inhomogeneities along the line of sight.   As a rough analogy: imagine looking at an image full of galaxies through a rippled piece of glass. While a circular lens might make a galaxy look smaller or larger, a ridge would have a preferential direction of magnification, and the galaxies under that ridge would have a statistical tendency to have slightly different sizes on average parallel vs perpendicular to the ridge.  Is such a phenomenon generally agreed to have been observed yet? Are there any plots (of any kind) that show such experimental data?    If I take this rough analogy one step further, while the peaks and troughs of the ripple magnify and demagnify, the midpoints between would be more prismatic - they would tend to deflect the centers, or locations of objects systematically, rather than affect the shapes. Applying this to cosmic shear, wouldn't the existence of shear essentially suggest that - to put it simply - stuff is, in fact, ""not quite"" where it appears to be?    above: from Free Ripple and Frosted Glass Overlays, Bojan Živković.

They were more like distorted yellow or golden rings formed or more like waves.  I don't know how to express this phenomenon! Then those two sparkles disappeared, and the brightness of this star decreased very very fast until it just disappeared. It was the first time in my life I saw something like this!

3981,Get a table of Moon phase angle per day,"Where can I get a table with the Moon phase angle for each day ?  It's available  here for a given day, but I would have to input each day of a year to get a full table.   === NEW EDIT : 2019-09-18 ===  Actually, I'm preparing a calendar of lunar phase with corresponding Moon photo for each day and for a whole year. For this, I downloaded a set of images here from Jay Tanner's website. The name of these images correspond to the phase degree, but when I associate these images with the data from JPL HORIZONS suggested by @Mike G, it doesn't match what I see in the Sky.  How can I associate a set of photo of Moon phases to each day of a given period of time (for instance, the current year) ? "
3982,What would we notice if the Sun stopped fusing atoms?,"(This question was stimulated by Would we have more than 8 minutes of light, if the sun &quot;went out&quot;?)  According to this answer, the ""Sun has enough gravitational potential energy to supply its current luminosity for tens of millions of years.""  Does ""current luminosity"" mean that the same spectrum will be radiated, or will it be just as bright, but radiating at different wavelengths (like not in the violet-blue and reddish orange-red wavelengths which chlorophyll requires, or the IR that keep us warm)?

3983,The role of gravity during planetesimal accretion,"As far as I understand, during the formation of a planetary disc, grains of dust stick together due to collisions and chemical bonding. Considering the size of the grain - say, 1 mm - and the speed - 1cm per sec - it would seem that gravity plays a minor role during accretion. My question is, to what extent is gravity a factor during accretion? To what extent is it related to fragmentation? In other words - how does gravity affect whether the fragments return and stick to the main body? Is there a size barrier, or is it dependent only on the speed? "

Like the earth is nearly flat and in small portion it's surface can be called 2d. But it possible to go ""straight"" and come back at the same spot as it is in ""3d space"".

There are two kinds of grbs, long burst and shot burst, which are caused by supernova explosions explosion and the merger of two neutron stars, respectively. However, at least one grb, J1644, is a tidal disruption event. Is there any other grb which was not caused by a supernova or the merger of two neutron stars?  When can we say that a supernova explosion is a grb after observations? How do we know an event is a grb especially when we missed its explosion?  Can we tell that the afterglow is caused by a grb?

3990,"Enceladus; why use the words ""geysers"", ""jets"", and ""plumes"" interchangeably?","Background, Europa:  In an earlier question How can “Geysers” on Europa reach heights of 100km? I brought up the use of the word ""geyser"" in association with the reported confirming observations of water vapor plumes on Europa. Europa size and surface gravity are nearly as large as those of Earth's moon. With an escape velocity of about 2,025 m/s it was hard for me to understand how an actual geyser could exist within the ice, a geyser so powerful that it could be shooting liquid water from the surface at 2 kilometers per second.   Part of the problem here is that I still can't be absolutely sure there is a clear definition of what is or isn't an actual geyser on solar system bodies other than Earth. On Earth, while a geyser is usually powered by geothermal conversion of water into steam, it pushes additional liquid water up to and above the surface as liquid. I believe that other sources of pressure may still result in proper Earth geysers.  Most scientific references I found referred to the vapor as plumes or jets, the word geyser was used in more popular and general interested articles.  It seems one likely explanation is a venting of water vapor (gas) from a particularly shaped vent can accelerate the molecules to an average velocity that is several times the speed of sound by converting random thermal motion to directed vertical motion, as described in a U.T. Austin thesis by Jared James Berg. Simulations there showed that this jet phenomenon can result in some water vapor reaching a substantial fraction of escape velocity, and rise to 100 to 200km altitudes. The model also addresses the formation of solids as ice crystals within the plume.  About Enceladus:  I have just come across the paper How the Geysers, Tidal Stresses, and Thermal Emission Across the South Polar Terrain of Enceladus are Related, (Porco, DiNino and Nimmo (2014), Ast. J. 148 (3), 45), an in depth study of sources of water vapor from Enceladus. I saw that both geysers and jets were mentioned in the abstract, but at the end of the second paragraph in the introduction I ran into the very interesting sentence:     (Throughout this paper, we use the terms “jets” and “geysers” interchangeably.)   The escape velocity on Enceladus is only about 240 m/s, nearly an order of magnitude lower than that on Europa, which means much less sub-surface pressure would be required to push liquid water high above the surface into near space. So I can understand that the term geyser might be more likely to be appropriate for these plumes than it would be for the plumes on higher surface gravity Europa.  Question:  I would know why the words ""geysers"" and ""jets""/""plumes"" would be used interchangeably. Is this because it hasn't been confirmed yet what they are, and the authors don't wish to show favoritism by choosing one or the other, or are they synonymous and can always be used interchangeably, or si there some other reason?      above x2: Figures 3a and 3b from Porco, DiNino and Nimmo (2014).

3991,What is the LSST's plan to address frequent satellite trails in data?,"In the 2011 Sixty Symbols video Spy Satellites (from Deep Sky Videos) after about 01:40 amateur astrophotographer Nik Szymanek says:     One thing I find when I’m out here imaging, by pointing the telescope at that part of the sky sort of south east at this time of night (early evening) there does seem to be a lot of satellites picked up by these images, and even on this 60 second exposure you can see we’ve got another satellite image there.       Well I mean satellites can be a problem for a deep sky imager in that if you’re using a telescope that has quite a wide field of view and you’re taking fairly long exposures, like five minutes or ten minutes, then at some point during that exposure it’s quite likely a satellite will be recorded passing in front of the image.      In fact a recent image that I’ve taken of the Andromeda galaxy with a refracting telescope actually recorded five satellite trails in a five minute exposure, so that gives you a good idea just how crowded the skies are with all these satellites are in orbit.   To me ""using a telescope that has quite a wide field of view... taking fairly long exposures like five or ten minutes..."" is a good description of how the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (main site) will operate. Granted the exposures may be closer to 15 seconds than 5-10 minutes, but on clear nights it will be imaging almost continuously for high throughput. The FOV is about 3.2 degrees, so ""wide field"" applies.  Question: Has a plan or strategy been outlined or established to reduce the number of bright satellite trails that appear in LSST perpetual sky surveys, and/or to process images to remove the trails or at least flag pixel regions that contain likely trails?  Nearly every satellite and other large object in low Earth orbit is catalogued and it's position versus time can be predicted to a few kilometer accuracy (7km/400km is about 1 degree for example) and the object being in sunlight or dark can be likewise calculated, so one could conceivably adjust the exposure sequence to avoid some of the brighter ones and predict where they are likely to appear in data. So I'd be surprised if nobody has addressed this in a formal way yet.      LSST from here "

3994,Is there a prediction when our solar system would fall apart?,"Within a few billion years our Sun would become a red giant and destroying Mercury and Venus and perhaps even the Earth. But nevertheless our solar system still have some planets like Jupiter and Neptune orbitting around the sun, because his mass wouldn't be very different.  After another while our Sun would turn into a white dwarf. Probably his mass changed a bit, but would it be enough to lose for example Neptune?  If not, is there a prediction at what time, if ever, our 'sun' will lose (some of) his planets for the first time? "
3995,Is there an established distinction between a geyser and a cryovolcano in solar system bodies?,"Is there an established distinction between a geyser and a cryovolcano in the context of cold solar-system bodies such as the moons of Jupiter and Saturn, or Kuiper belt objects (e.g. Pluto)?   Both can lead to spreading of new water across the surface, and both can result in plumes of water vapor above the surface. Do they have distinctly different mechanisms?  Or is it unclear or in a state of flux, a bit like the diagram in @zephyr's answer to Do astronomers generally agree that the distinction between comets and astroids is not so clear? "

4000,Why do Uranus' and Pluto's moons orbit the equator? What makes a moons' inclination tilt with the rotational axis of their planet?,"Uranus and Pluto have their axes of rotation almost 90 degrees towards the ecliptic. But why do their moons tilt the same way?  Does it mean that their tilts were caused by passing near some external mass that affected the planet and its moons equally, rather than some planet specific process such as a comet impact or tectonics?  Mars' rotational axis tilts over time, but its moons today are spot on over its temporary equator. Earth's moon is aligned with the ecliptic and doesn't seem to care about our planetary tilt, although (or because of?) oceanic masses tugging on its tides. Exoplanets have been found that don't orbit in alignment with their star's rotation, and why would they do so billions of years after formation? "
4001,Why do comets come from our local Oort cloud instead of from interstellar sources?,"Comets form where stars form. And they are then ejected by the orbital changes of giant planets. But why are they ejected to form specifically a local Oort cloud instead of going interstellar and becoming vagabonds? The fact that comets come from all directions doesn't discriminate between them coming from an Oort cloud or from interstellar sources.  The main argument against the idea of one star capturing a comet from another star, seems to be that the relative velocity is too high for that. But consider the huge age of the Sun which is now on its 18th or so orbit through this crowded galactic star field disc. And which by chance or co-formation might have now, or at some earlier time, roughly the same velocity as some other millions of other stars. And what if there are many (many) more comets formed and/or ejected from young stars than currently supposed?  Is it really unlikely that the Oort ""cloud of comets"" instead largely represents an interstellar source? "
4002,Do/did the asteroids contain enough water to create Earth's oceans?,It seems from the recent Science paper by Altwegg et al (2014) that the commonly accepted source of Earth's water being the comets might not be (completely) true. Their study suggest that the water in the comet they studied is different from Earth's (higher Deuterium content). The alternative source of water that Altwegg suggests is from asteroids. My perception is that there is not that much water in asteroids or at least not sufficient to create Earth's oceans. How much water is in asteroids now? How much water was there in asteroids reaching Earth when the oceans were formed?

The Jupiter-like world is unusually large compared with its host star, contradicting a widely held idea about the way planets form.   On the other hand, binary stars are very common, comprising (according to Wikipedia) about one third of star systems.    Naively, the same processes that create binary star systems could be expected to also create star systems comprised of a single star and a Jupiter-like ""failed star"" - the only difference being that in the latter case the would-be second star wasn't large enough to ignite.  What is the difference between these scenarios?  What makes the small-star-and-large-planet, according to the standard models of planet formation, unlikely, when binary stars are common?

4006,Why are stars so far apart?,"So, this is mere musing, but it seems that stars are quite extremely far apart. I tried to determine the mean distance between nearest neighbors for stars (in just our galaxy) but I'm not sure what it is, though a first approximations I would guess that the mean is around 5 ly with some 0.5 standard deviation or so!  However, assuming I didn't screw up, the distance between two sun-massed objects required to generate 1,000N of force between them is an incredible 54.3 million ly. [Edit] If you change that to 1 billion Newtons, the distance is one galactic radius -- 54000~ ly!  I'm probably mis-estimating how much even 1kN of force would effect solar trajectories over time, but I still can't help but feel that our solar neighbors are very far away given the spheres of interaction that I would expect.  Any insights? "

4008,How does radio bandwidth restrict the choice and use of science payload on interplanetary probes?,"I asked a question here about returning to Earth a physical memory capsule along with soil samples, as a complement to radio operations as today. This might return a much larger amount of data compared with radio today, but of course only at the end of the mission.  How useful would it be for a sample return mission like Mars2020 or Hayabusa2, to be able to return much more data? Would the choice of instruments change to allow for higher sampling rates, higher resolution, more filters et cetera? Is Big Data science instruments from an interplanetary mission even a possibility, or is today's bandwidth good enough for any conceivable payload? "
4009,Tracing back OMNI data to the sun,"I have been reading the OMNIWeb data documentation in order to clarify one particular question without success. I need to associate each measurement in the OMNI dataset to a moment in time at the sun (at least to narrow it to a time interval). Therefore, I need to understand how long it takes for the solar wind to get from the sun to the point where it is measured. I understand that the solar wind velocity is variable, so this time interval is constantly changing.  Could you please help me understand this question? Can the solar wind measurements be used to trace back into the moment at which it left the sun? I would be very grateful if you could explain or point me to some sufficient references. "

Or are they candidates because the data hints that a planet might be there but we need more detailed data or more analysis before we can confirm it? "
4011,Can expansion of space blueshift galaxies with respect to one another?,"Suppose we have two galaxies in an otherwise devoid space, and suppose the galaxies are gravitating. Suddenly, dark energy kicks in, and accelerated expansion of space begins ...   (1D force diagram. Ruddy rectangles represent the two galaxies, violet ellipses represent dark energy.)  Because the galaxies are gravitating, dark energy between them expands space less, while ""behind"" the galaxies, where their mutual gravities don't overlap as much, dark energy exhibits a greater effect. The arrows above the galaxies compare force vectors. The black arrows are forces of gravitational attraction, the violet arrows are forces of expansion. Eyeballing the vectors' sum for each respective galaxy, it seems that the galaxies get an extra kick of acceleration from the regions of greater expansion behind them.  If we play the movie in our heads with these assumptions: the galaxies start off by accelerating toward one another under their own mutual gravitational attraction (each observes a blueshift), then dark energy kicks in and the galaxies accelerate with more energy than can be accounted for by acceleration due to their own gravities alone (blueshift observed much greater than it should be).    I have always read and heard of redshifted galaxies, not blueshifted ones (well, not so much, anyway), so something must be wrong here.  Question: Can the expansion of the universe drive two galaxies together like this? Does the net effect of expansion behind and between the galaxies cancel out, resulting in no greater acceleration? Have I got this all wrong? "
4012,Is there an alternative (potentially easier to understand) Euler diagram of the new solar system body classification?,"note: This question is asking for a representation of the astronomical classification scheme now used for solar system bodies as established (presumably) by the Working Group for Planetary System Nomenclature (WGPSN) of the International Astronomical Union or IAU. While graphical layout is mentioned as part of the question's motivation, the question is not about layout or graphics.   The Euler diagram shown in this helpful answer is hard for me to understand, I think mostly due to graphical layout. The diagram shows the mathematical relationship between various sets (in this case solar system body classifications) so it could be drawn with widely differing choices of layout and still retain exactly the same mathematical relationships.  I am wondering if there is some attempt here to indicate relative numbers or ratios by the degree of overlap? Look closely at the small overlap of Minor Planets with Comets. Is that meant to reflect in some way a relatively small overlap quantitatively? Did you notice it took a while to even make sure you were seeing the overlap correctly? This style of layout requires the use of color perception to help identify which label is associated with which contour while simultaneously trying to follow one line in a groups of perfectly parallel lines.  Have other versions of this Euler diagram representation of solar system body classification been published? A link to one or even inclusion of the diagram in the answer itself would be greatly appreciated!    above: Example of an Euler diagram in this Wikipedia article, from here.    above: Example of a somewhat easier to use and understand Euler diagram, from here, used in the same Wikipedia article.

4013,Does the spin rate of a black hole correspond to a physical feature?,"If the mass and orbital period for two neutron stars is known before collapse to a black hole and the rate of spin is known after collapse, 100 revolutions per second for instance, that will correlate mathmatically to a specific radius.  Does this radius correlate to a physical feature of the black hole such as a surface? Does this radius fall between the radius of the physical substance and the Schwarzschild radius? Is it the largest, intermediate, or the smallest of these? "
4014,"How do large telescopes, especially plans for the LSST, avoid saturation artifacts from the brightest stars and planets?","This interesting answer to What is the LSST's plan to address frequent satellite trails in data? quotes:     From the LSST webpage:           The first group of Starlink satellites are sufficiently bright during dawn and dusk (when LSST would be surveying) that the trail would exceed sensor saturation, generating uncorrectable artifacts in the data. If instead these satellites were painted flat black making them a factor of 25 fainter, satellite trails should be less of a challenge for LSST due to its specific design.In that case LSST's frequent imaging of the same region of sky will provide enough data to correct for unsaturated satellite trails or other anomalies.      But now I'm wondering about something a little different. How do large telescopes doing surveys avoid saturation-induced artifacts caused by the brightest stars and planets? Their positions are of course absolutely predictable, so I suppose it's possible to keep their images slightly off of the silicon, and ""walk around"" them with a series of exposures, is that what the LSST will do?  There are other possibilities, for example a small, mechanical obscuring disk that can be introduced ahead of the CCD to cast a small slightly diffuse shadow, or in the case of multiple CCDs one could put the object between two sensors.  How is this done in practice, and how is the LSST planned to avoid this problem? "
4015,Is the universe simply a mass of atoms in 'void'; what does it look like?,"I've always been stumped with the question of what lies beyond the universe, and I've come to the firm conclusion - void (i.e. completely empty).

The paradox is defined in Wikipedia and captured in this video  There is a video from ""Vsauce""  [website]which pretends to explain the phenomenon but fails, IMO. From his explanation I only get that light beam should deviate from the direct route to move along the orbital around the Earth, like if it is the Sun or Moon orbit seen from the Earth. But why? The nebular objects orbit because they have mass and gravitationally bound. Why should light beam travelling from Sun to the Moon bend the same way as if it orbits around the Earth?

4022,"Is it possible to steer the sight of a Liquid Mirror Telescope using a plain mirror scheme? If yes, why hasn't it been done?","I have read about Liquid Mirror Telescopes in a number of places, and according to these sources, a major disadvantage of these telescopes is that they can only ""see"" straight up.  In a nutshell, the usually very expensive primary mirror is replaced with a rotating mercury container. The mercury surface will become parabolic with the rotation and earth's gravity, and a camera is placed in the focal point of the parabola (straight above the container). Since the parabolic shape depends on gravity, the primary cannot be tilted and the telescope can only point straight up.  My question is: couldn't one use a mirror scheme to steer the sight of this telescope? For example a pair of big plain mirrors a bit above the focal point, working similarly to a periscope. Then one could change the angles of these two plain mirrors and point to different directions in the sky.  I am assuming a large plain mirror is much cheaper than a parabolic mirror of the same size.  Has this been done? If not, why? "

4026,"Solar System formation, considering its and the universe's age","It is known that the Sun is 4.6 billion years old, and the complete Solar System is of a similar age. The class of stars to which the Sun belongs seems to be quite common. Stars of its class can live for 8 or 9 billion years before moving to the red giant stage. Also, the whole universe is less than 14 billion years old.  Thus, not many generations of Sun-like stars could have existed before the first stages of our Solar System. And heavy elements are created when stars collapse. While there could be a lot of star classes with much shorter lifespans, I'm wondering: where do the heavier elements came from? Not only for our Solar System, but many others. I think it is very likely that our Solar System is of average age; do the numbers match between dead stars and remote stellar systems? Are there studies about this? "
4027,Can cosmic rays alone produce noticeable aurorae in bodies far away from the Sun?,"Aurorae are caused by energetic particles interacting with planetary atmospheres. Part of this flux comes from the Sun (solar wind) while the rest is cosmic radiation. My main question is: could a planetary body located far away from the Sun (or any other star), with a suitable atmosphere and magnetosphere, have noticeable* aurorae, just from being exposed to cosmic rays? A related question would be: do we know how much of the aurora is caused by the solar wind, and how much by cosmic rays? And thirdly: is there any other way that a planetary body could produce aurorae, such as its own electromagnetic emissions?  *I know ""noticeable"" doesn't really work as a limit, but for the time being, I'm talking of electromagnetic radiation that can be distinguished clearly from the background of a planet's disc using instruments not more advanced than our current telescopes at interplanetary distances.

4028,Day/Night Cycles and Seasons if the Earth's Rotational Axis and Orbit Changed,"I just enrolled in an introductory Astronomy course, and today in lecture the professor asked this question:     Give 4 ways in which the day/night cycle and the seasons would behave on Earth if our rotational axis was in our orbital plane (Uranus is close to this). What about if the rotational axis was perpendicular to the orbital plane (so the ecliptic and Celestial Equator lay on top of each other), but the Earth's orbit was quite eccentric instead of almost circular?   For the first part, it means the Earth is rotating by North/South, right? Would this mean that the day/nights would be ""flipped around,"" i.e. it would be night in a city when it would normally be day. I don't think the seasons would change, since the orbit remains the same.  I don't really know what the 2nd part is saying. Is it simply asking what would change if the orbit was eccentric rather than what it is now?  Any help or clarification on this would be greatly helpful. Thank you! "
4029,How (the heck) does Astrometry.net work?,"What magic is this?   This answer to my question Astronomy detective question: what part of the sky are these photos of? What are a few of the stars? nails it, and the output (linked there) contains the following images along with a whole lot more information.  The images are analyzed by astrometry.net  How does it do what it does? If I understand correctly you can upload random star images with a wide variety of fields of view (from telescopes to cell phones) and random orientations and no further information, and it figures it out.  Is there a way to explain how the algorithm works with more detail than ""a computer matches the dots to known stars""?   Related question about these cell phone images: Milky Way with a cell phone, how is this possible?        "
4030,Why do scientists think life requires water?,"As far as I know, scientists seeking extraterrestial life are simply looking for plantets containing water in liquid state. To be honest, I find this weird.  It is true that life - in the form we know on Earth - cannot exists without water. But how can one proof that such life isn't but a special case out of a bunch of other different types of life?  Actually, I think we can come out with at least one example of a ""organism-like thingy"" that would not require liquid water. Well, we could build a simple robot, whose ""natural ecosystem"" would be a junkyard (for mechanical, electric and electronic garbage). That robot would would fuel itself with solar energy, and reproduce by seeking out appropiate parts in the junkyard and building a copy of itself from them. Of course, that's just a theoretical example, I know it has many faoults, but I still hope the idea is clear - it should be indeed possible for life to exists without water.  I have also heard (sorry, I can't remember the source) that theoretically, there could be an organism whose metabolism would rely on sulphur.  So, unless scientists can proove that no life can exists without water (any life; not just Earth-like life), why do they keep looking just for water?  Unless, of course, we define ""life"" as ""any organism functioning like Earth organisms; therefore, metabolising organic structures with enzymes, built of protein, requiring water, etc""   BTW. This question is a little bit different than Why is liquid water considered a requirement for life? . The answers there were pointing out that water is a good solvent. And I'm (also) asking why is any similar solvent considered needed. See my example above. "
4031,Can an observer on Earth only see half of the sky?,"Is this the following statement true?     An observer on earth only may see half of sky from the northern or southern hemisphere, and even if the observer stands on the equator on top of a very high mountain, he will hardly be able to see all the stars in the sky in given period!   Do most globe-like objects in space have this property?  I'd appreciate any more remarks on the subject. "
4032,Eccentric Earth Orbit and Day/Night Cycles,"If the Earth's rotational axis was perpendicular to the orbital plane, but the orbit also highly eccentric (sun at center), how would that affect the day/night cycles?   What I think is that during the time the Earth's closer to the sun, because the gravitational pull is stronger, it would make the Earth spin faster than thereby creating much shorter days than if the Earth was near the focii of the orbit (on which the days/nights would be longer). Is this line of thinking correct? "
4033,Could the planets in the Solar System have been captured?,"Ignoring any current beliefs, is it possible that the planets could have been captured by the Sun's gravitational force after drifting through space while retaining their axis of spin and speed?  Notably, Venus uniquely has retrograde rotation; how would this have come about based on current theories? "

When I look at the Horizon's ephemeris data for Mars, this gives me argument of perifocus equal to roughly 286.53 degrees on epoch J2000. When I look up its longitude of perihelion for the same epoch here, I get roughly 336.04 degrees. I thought these two parameters are the same thing. What is the difference between them? Why are the two numbers not the same? "
4036,Characteristics of the first planets in the Universe?,"What would have the very first planets looked like, based on their most likely chemical compositions?  For example:   Were they mostly grey gas giants with atmospheres of hydrogen and helium, coalescing around the first Population II stars? Were they blue gas giants, enriched with water vapour? Were they brownish-red and grey, like our own Jupiter and Saturn? Were they a heterogeneous mix of all sizes, colours, and chemical compositions that included rocky and gas giants?   What papers support research into this area?   [website][website][website]Note: By first planets I mean the first planets that most likely existed in the Universe. In The habitable epoch of the early Universe, for example, Loeb suggests that a mere 13.5 ± 3.5 Myr after the Hot Big Bang could have witnessed the first viable supernova followed by planet formation. Another paper (can't find it) suggested that gas giants could have formed from the primordial hydrogen and helium soup before reionization, without needing any stars.

4038,How often and over what period is Earth’s rotation averaged to compute UT1?,"I understand that UT1 (and for that matter UT0, UT2, etc.) are based on averages of actual earth rotation, and serve as a form of mean solar time. However it’s not clear to me when these averages are taken and over what range? Certainly the average is taken over at least a year; but beyond that I can’t tell. Daily over the year? Yearly over the year; over several years?  How often and over what period is Earth’s rotation averaged to compute UT1? "
4039,Method to determine the amount of reflected starlight necessary for an exoplanet to be visible from a given distance/angle?,"What is the method to determine the amount of reflected starlight necessary for an exoplanet to be visible from a given distance/angle? (Not from occlusion but actually visible on its own.) Further, how can you quantify this and calculate/predict/measure natural and artificial variations in the amount of reflected light?  I would like to see equations that take into account/assume the following things:   the properties of the detection equipment, such as telescope mirror diameter, optical resolving power, digital resolution and sensitivity (I'm a newbie to astronomy so I don't know the proper terms or units for these things; I come from the world of photography with ISO, pixel count, noise levels, etc.).  the properties of the exoplanet such as diameter, distance from host star, surface reflectance coefficient on a hypothetical maximally ""clear day"", atmospheric thickness and reflected light absorption due to gasses, angles of a triangle drawn between the host star, exoplanet, and Earth. assume a space-based telescope on Earth and assume no interstellar dust of significance. assume no significant warping of spacetime by intense gravitational fields (i.e. we are looking at something in our stellar neighborhood, no further than, say, 50-100 LY)   Based on my nooblet research so far this equation should result in a figure expressed in Janksy units, I think? But I should like to know the average (RMS) photons per second that come from the exoplanet into the telescope, along with the peak value, during the periods of maximum and minimum intensity (i.e. when the planet is brightest and dimmest).  Please give an example using figures for the best equipment we currently have available for this purpose and provide links if you can to the website for that project. Please in the example, just for the sake of argument, use a planet and star exactly like Earth and the Sun. If a planet like Earth would not be detectable at these parameters, assume more powerful detection equipment (just scale up the telescope's properties until it would work at a 10 LY distance and say how much you had to scale it up, and feel free to opine on how unrealistic such a device is).  Lastly, and here's the kicker: now assume an artificial object with a perfectly flat reflecting surface exists upon one side of this exoplanet. How would you incorporate the precise amount of extra light added by such a surface to the above equation as a separate part of the equation? Assume that you know the following properties of the reflecting surface in advance:   area of the flat reflecting surface reflectance coefficient of the material used for constructing the surface  geometric shape (assume a contiguous primitive geometric shape like a disc or square or triangle, or disregard if this property is irrelevant. If it's not irrelevant, then why is it not? What difference would the shape make on what gets detected?) angle between the reflecting surface plane and a plane tangent to the average sphere of the planet.   For an example lets assume a disc of polished white stone (0.8 reflectance) 20,000 sq. m. in size, positioned on at the part of the planet with the brightest insolation, at a 45-degree angle from the tangent plane. It's polished to a degree, but not a mirror. When the planet rotates, at some point, this surface reflects the host star's light directly towards Earth and would cause a glint of light for a small amount of time. How do we calculate the glint's duration? How would we mathematically distinguish such a glint? How could you tell if such a glint was reflected starlight as opposed to a laser pulse or other artificial light source?  What size would such an artificial reflecting surface (0.8 reflectance) need to be in order to make a planet visible with today's best telescopes from various distances up to 10 LY, where under current technology, the planet is not visible?   UPDATE:  I realized that in the case of flat reflecting surfaces then the inverse square law would not apply from the distance of the exoplanet to Earth, due to Hero's rule (aka the law of reflection aka specular reflection). That means a totally still, large, flat body of water reflecting starlight, or a highly polished surface (like that of the Great Pyramid after its construction) would reflect a signal into space from the host star that would be detectable from a much greater distance away than the diffuse, incident light being reflected off of the planetary surface (which light would be subject to the inverse square law from the point of incidence).  Variables that would come into play would be the reflectance of the surface, the absorption of the atmosphere, flatness of the surface, and the level of insolation provided by the star.   By my preliminary calculations the reflections off of the Great Pyramid would be visible from 20 LY.  "

4041,Retrieving input effective radius from Sérsic profile,"I'm playing around with Sérsic profiles, and would like to retrieve the effective (half-light) radius that I put in by integration of the profile. I'm not managing to, so perhaps someone can help me out.  I create the profile using astropy:  from astropy.modeling.functional_models import Sersic1D from scipy.integrate import simps Sersic = Sersic1D(amplitude=1,r_eff=1,n=1)   I can then make a light profile:  x = np.arange(1000) I = Sersic(x)   Then we can perform an integral over this I(r):  integral = [simps(I[0:i],x[0:i]) for i in np.arange(len(I)-1)+1]   From which one would finally find the radius at which the enclosed flux is half that of the total:  from scipy.interpolate import interp1d  f_int = interp1d(integral,np.arange(len(I)-1)+1) print 'Half radius: ', f_int(integral[-1]/2.)   However, this does not give me the desired result -- the input radius of 1. Why not? Is this a conceptual error or a numerical one - or both? "
4042,"Accretion disks - why are they disk-shaped, rather than spherical?","So, the theory (briefly) about accretion disks is that stuff falling into the black hole will most likely not fall straight into it but will miss it and go into orbit, perhaps for a long time, perhaps for a short time, before finally falling in.  That makes sense.  But, why disks?  Wouldn't the matter falling into the BH be coming from all directions, and thus fall into orbits in all planes around the BH, not just one?  Or, is it that once there's a hint of ""plane preference"" in the debris, this will tend to be self-reinforcing, and anything subsequently falling into orbit around the BH will hit something in the disk, and so end up (perhaps after many collisions) being swept around in the disk as well?

Similar question: If Venus and Mars changed places, would we then have 3 habitable planets? "
4045,How does the number in stellar classification indicate properties within the range of that class?,"I am doing some research for a video game and I wanted to store stellar data on a star, such as its Stellar Classification, and then from that derive a physical appearance in the game.  These are fictional stars.  My original thought had been to store the star's classification, For example G2V and then at runtime I could use that data to determine things like surface temperature, brightness, radius, and mass.  From temperature I can also derive color.  However when I sat down to start coding a first pass on this I noticed something that confused me.  According to Wikipedia, our Sun, Sol, is a G2V star.  The number is supposed to indicate a ""sub"" classification.  A G2 star would be 20% between a G star and a K star.  A table there lists a G type star as having a surface temperature between 5,200 K and 6,000 K.  Therefore I figured a G2 star would have a temperature of about (I know nothing here is EXACT) 5,360 K (20% of the way between 5,200 and 6,000) but apparently it actually has a temperature of 5,800 K which is about 75% between the given range.  So why is Sol not a G7 of G8 star?  And then once I hit that irregularity, I had to assume that things like Radius and Mass are probably also not linearly interpolated along the range.  Is there a feasible way to derive properties such as I am looking at based on the Stellar Classification? "

4058,"A vertical stick's shadow at solar noon should be straight north/south, right?","At true solar noon, the subsolar point should be directly north or south of you, and therefore a vertical stick's shadow should point directly north or south, right?  The Wikipedia page for Sun Path is confusing me.  It claims that at the equinoxes, a vertical stick's shadow will point 23.5° off of true north or south.  It says that you only get straight north/south shadows at solar noon at the solstices.     On the equator, the sun will be straight overhead and a vertical stick will cast no shadow at solar noon on the equinoxes. On the vernal equinox, north of the subsolar point (on the equator) the vertical stick's shadow will point a little westwards of true north (NNW) reading 336.5° from true north and little eastwards of true south (SSE) reading 156.5° from true north. On the autumnal equinox, north of the subsolar point (on the equator), the shadow will point a little eastwards of true north (NNE) reading 23.5° from true north (and south of the subsolar, the shadow will point a little westward of true south (SSW) reading 203.5° from true north).      --[website]Why would this be true?  My understanding is that true solar noon is defined by when the Sun is directly north or south, and the subsolar point is on your longitude.  Mean solar noon is a different story, thanks to the equation of time. "
4059,How do you measure something that has already left the observable universe?,"They say that the observable universe is only 5% of the entire equation. The rest of it consists of dark matter and energy. I believe that they are trying to find a way to see something that cannot be seen due to being outside of the observable universe, sort of like how galaxies redshift and slowly face away of out existence.   tl;dr  does dark matter/energy increase every year?  What comes after red shift? Black? If so, then does that mean the universe is mostly black because 95% of matter has ""Blackshifted""?  Did I post a question correctly? "
4060,Where does the dust on 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko come from?,"As we (laymen) are told, comets lose gas and dust when they descent into the denser regions of the solar system. Seemingly so much and so large parts that they can even cause meteor showers like in the case of the Leonids from 55P/Temple-Tuttle.  Nevertheless we were also told, that the surface of 67P is covered with several centimeres of dust over a much harder surface. Where does the dust come from? The solar wind should have blown away any lose dust long ago, no? Is there a process which regenerates dust on the surface every cycle? "
4061,Orbital speed is (vector) sum of tangential and normal speed?,"Orbital speed definition in wiki does not state clearly - it is just tangential speed component or square root of squares of normal and tangential speed (full speed vector).  When we say that moon orbital speed is 1 km per sec, we don't know its tangential speed (speed along its trajectory), right? We need some complicated math to calculate it (because of normal speed component inside that 1 km/sec orbital speed)? "
4062,Is the centre of axial precession perfectly perpendicular to the ecliptic?,"It is my understanding that the Earth's axial precession is such that the direction of the North pole pointing to the celestial sphere traces out a circle with a period of roughly 26,000 years. My first question on reading this was, where is the centre of that circle? In other words, what axis is the Earth precessing about? I had assumed this would be somewhat arbitrary but have since learned that it points towards the north ecliptic pole. Am I then correct to assume that planets naturally tend to rotate in the same plane as their orbits, but the effects of precession caused by other massive bodies cause the axis of rotation to oscillate around the north ecliptic instead?  If so, then what is going on with Uranus and it's unusually high axial tilt? Is this another phenomenon or does Uranus' rotation axis also precess about it's own ecliptic north pole? Albeit with a much larger amplitude. "
4063,Counter clockwise rotation of storms at Jupiter's north pole. What explanations have been proposed?,"On Earth, high pressures and low pressures occur interchangeably. So that where two pressure systems intersect, they move the air in the same direction. But as Juno revealed the first observations of Jupiter's north pole, that doesn't seem to be the case over there. There are eight gigantic storms surrounding a ninth one, and they all move counter clockwise. With two smaller ones in between on one side that do move clockwise.  How can this be explained? How is this possible?    JPL Juno IR image of Jupiter's north pole "

Considering all the eyes on the sky these days, how bright, apparent mag V, would it get before being discovered here on earth? 9 or 10 seem reasonable?

4066,How much infrared radiation is emitted by a bow shock?,"Has the amount of energy being emitted from R Hydrae's bow shock been studied?    If so, is there any information how much infrared radiation is emitted in any means of measurement?   If the infrared energy from the Sun, measured 1 AU from the Sun being approximately 680 watts per meter square, how would the infrared energy of the bow shock compare at the same distance measured in the same units?  Thanks to AtmosphericPrisonEscape for pointing me in the right direction.  I found this table from the DETECTION OF A FAR-INFRARED BOW SHOCK NEBULA AROUND R HYA: THE FIRST MIRIAD RESULTS.   with the CSEs being the circumstellar envelopes.  Does this mean the CSE (bow shock?) is about 57% (19.7 compared to 33.9) the flux of the star at the 70 microns (mosaic) band? "

4068,Adaptive Optics observations worse than natural seeing observations for faint structures?,"I have read that one drawback of Adaptive Optics (AO) IFU observations is that they have lower SNR (compared natural seeing observations) and as a result it is harder to observe faint structures. For example, in a galaxy observation, while AO can give great resolution in the inner parts of the galaxy, the faint outskirts or the disk are more visible with natural seeing observations. Is that true? Why AO are not good with faint structures? I assume there is some loss of light during the whole process involved with AO which results in lower SNR? Can someone give me more details please?  EDIT1:  In this paper: [website]  In the galaxies from the LSD sample we find more complex morphologies   which are likely the consequence of the AO-assisted observations   providing higher spatial resolution (∼0.2''FWHM) which allows us to   spatially resolve more complex structures, but lower sensitivity to   extended sources given the higher surface brightness detection   threshold.   Which implies that the AO are causing lower sensitivity. Maybe the lower sensitivity has something to do with the brightness of the laser used in the AO observations? "

4070,Difference between 3D real space and 3D redshift space?,"With regards to cosmological simulations (e.g., N-body dark matter only simulations), I've seen people talk about the positions of objects (halos, galaxies) in the simulation in terms of 3D real space and 3D redshift space. The idea is that the positions of objects in 3D real space does not add the contribution of redshift space distortions, whereas 3D redshift space does. But since redshift space distortions are a real physical effect (i.e., the positions/velocities of objects will be affected not only by cosmological expansion but also gravitational interactions), why is 3D real space ever even considered? Is it some kind of highly idealistic cosmology-dependent only scenario, ignoring peculiar velocities?  "

In discussions and graphs about big bang nucleosynthesis nothing above lithium is even mentioned. It's a pretty safe bet that none of the heavier elements have been observed in reasonably primordial gases, since the implications would be profound enough to require mention in even popular level books about the big bang.  That said, has anyone bothered to perform searches for all of the heavier elements? As in, do we have explicit experimental upper limits on the concentrations of some or all of these heavier elements, or just a more qualitative, ""No evidence seen for anything else""? "

4076,To which extent is optically thick photon transport related to conduction?,"When speaking about energy transport, the textbook, physics-101 always lists three possibilities:   radiation convection conduction   Now when studying radiation transport in (stellar) atmospheres and of course astronomy &amp; astrophysics in general, we are always concerned about the photon mean-free path [tex]. When [tex] becomes too small compared to a scattering or absorption mean-free path, the equations of radiation transport turn into a diffusion equation for the photon intensity [tex] at frequency [tex], so that we get [tex] where the diffusion coefficient [tex] in the optically thick limit is proportional to density [tex] and opacity [tex], [tex].    Now I want to understand differences of this process to conduction, which is similarly modeled with a diffusion equation, but different underlying transport physics. In solid state physics lectures one often derives the heat and transport of crystals, which then is given by the properties of how well phonons can transport momentum inside the crystal.  So finally, my question: As we go deep into a star, a white dwarf or a Jupiter-like planet, the efficiency of optically thick photon transport becomes less and less. So in our transport equations, do we need to replace photon transport terms at some point brute-force by phonon/sound wave energy transport terms, or do they arise naturally when photons are scattered off phonons?  I'll add a TLDR: Is optically thick phonon transport and conduction like in solid state physics sometimes the same? "

4078,Why do different instrumental filters use different magnitude systems (Vega vs AB)?,"Suppose I wanted to construct the spectral energy distribution (SED) of an object. Further suppose I observe this object through the 9 broad-band filters using the Subaru Suprimecam (just for an example) here: [website]As the statement below the table of broad-band filters says, the Johnson-Cousins filters (capital letters) are on the Vega magnitude system whereas the SDSS filters (lowercase letters) are on the AB magnitude system. I understand what these two magnitude systems are and how to convert between them.  My question is: what is the point of the two sets of filters being on different magnitude systems, one Vega and the other AB? It's not as if the Johnson-Cousins filter hardware physically has the Vega spectrum built into it, right...?   If I do aperture photometry on an I-band image and an i'-band image, will the first one return Vega magnitude of the object and the second return AB magnitude of the object, by default? And if I wanted to do SED fitting, then I need to be consistent such that all of my data points (even from other telescopes) need to be on the same magnitude system (e.g., convert the I-band Vega magnitude into an I-band AB magnitude)? (Or do that conversion first, and only then convert to flux units via [tex] or [tex]). "
4079,How will microshutter arrays be used in the James Webb and future space telescopes?,"Question: How will microshutter arrays be used in the James Webb and future space telescopes? Are they acting as a sort of moving pinhole or slit, or is the pattern more complicated, like a coded aperture telescope? I can't imagine that would work though, as the application seems to include spectroscopy rather than just image reconstruction.    The NASA Goddard news item NASA to Demonstrate New Star-Watching Technology with Thousands of Tiny Shutters says:     The technology, called the Next-Generation Microshutter Array (NGMSA), will fly for the first time on the Far-ultraviolet Off Rowland-circle Telescope for Imaging and Spectroscopy, or FORTIS, mission on October 27. The array includes 8,125 tiny shutters, each about the width of a human hair, that open and close as needed to focus on specific celestial objects.   and      The microshutter technology gives scientists the ability to produce multiple spectra at once. This capability improves productivity on both sounding rocket missions, which offer only six minutes of observing time, or large space-based observatories, which can take up to a week to observe faint, far-away objects and gather enough light to obtain good spectra. With observing time at a premium, the ability to gather light from multiple objects at once is paramount.       Webb, scheduled to launch in 2021, will carry NASA's first-generation microshutter technology — four 365-by-172 microshutter arrays that together total 250,000 shutters. They will allow Webb to obtain spectra of hundreds of objects simultaneously.        What distinguishes the next-generation array on FORTIS from the one flying on Webb is how the shutters are opened and closed. Webb’s arrays employ a large magnet that sweeps over the shutters to activate them. However, as with all mechanical parts, the magnet takes up space and adds weight. Furthermore, magnetically activated arrays can’t be easily scaled up in size. As a result, this older technology is at a disadvantage for supporting future space telescopes larger than Webb.      Magnet Eliminated      To accommodate future missions, Goddard’s microshutter-development team eliminated the magnet. The shutters in the pilot 128-by-64 array that will fly on FORTIS open and close through electrostatic interactions. By applying an alternating-current voltage to electrodes placed on the frontside of the microshutters, the shutters swing open. To latch the desired shutters, a direct current voltage is applied to electrodes on the backside.      Without a magnet, the next-generation array can be dramatically scaled up in size — and that’s precisely what the team is attempting to accomplish. Particularly, Greenhouse and Li are using advanced manufacturing techniques to create a much larger, 840-by-420 array equipped with 352,800 microshutters, dramatically increasing an instrument’s field of view.      “The array that is flying on FORTIS is a technology development prototype for the big one,” Greenhouse said.

4080,Can matter fly directly into a black hole and avoid the accretion disc?,"From what my non-scientifically-trained mind understands, matter typically enters a black hole via getting caught up in the accretion disc going faster and closer to the black hole until it passes the event horizon, the point of no return. Using Earth as an analogy for a black hole, I assume the accretion disc would orbit around the equator, similar to Saturn's rings, and the matter might eventually crash into Brazil or somewhere along the equator?  My main question is, can matter simply do a straight shot into the black hole at a higher latitude, say straight into New York City, avoiding the disc altogether?  As you can probably tell by my simplistic analogy, I am a complete layperson. While fancy jargon and artistic looking equations might be expected (which is fine), please also dumb it down to an average intelligent business administration major's level of scientific understanding.

Because surely all matter in the universe must have a gravitational pull because it has mass, just because we dont see it anymore doesn't mean it's force has disappeared from the observable universe?  So what if the matter we can't see outside the observable universe shows itself by imposing its gravitational forces on everything we can see within the observable universe? "

Luminosity is the total energy emitted by a source, in watts. However, I'm confused about luminous flux and radiant flux. Since radiant flux is the total energy emitted by an object, would that make luminosity the same as radiant flux? Then how does luminous flux relate to luminosity? Is luminous flux just radiant flux, but only showing the visible light? And this website, [website]"

4085,Cosmological redshift - How do we know it's not caused by the observer's time dilation?,"Instead of cosmological redshift being caused by the metric expansion of space, why couldn't cosmological redshift be caused by our perspective moving faster in time?  Said another way, if the observer moved through time faster than the emission source, couldn't this time dilation be an explanation of cosmological redshift?  Instead of the metric expansion of space, why not ""cosmic time dilation""?    As far as I know, there is no physical mechanism in physics to explain how the metric expansion can cause red shift.  It appears that we assume metric expansion can cause red shift with no underlying physics or testing.     Alternatively, red shift caused by time dilation is well tested, proven, and understood.  It is something we can play with here on Earth.    Wouldn't assuming cosmological redshift is caused by the observer moving faster in time than the emission source in the past makes more sense than the metric expansion of space causing cosmological redshift?  Of course when measuring redshift from distant sources, the Doppler and gravitational effects must be accounted for.  That's not what I'm asking about.    Edit:  I probably need some math help, or a pointer to a better example to play with.    With a Hubble Constant of 71.9, a lightyear expands about [tex] per year.  The Pinwheel Galaxy is 20.87 million light years light years away.  If I continuously redshift the Pinwheel Galaxy by the expansion of space, I get a redshift of .00153 using this equation:    [tex]  The pinwheel galaxy has a measured Redshift of .000804.    Is there an equation that gives a better result without magic values for [tex] or a real world example with known values that works?  "
4086,What could have made a satellite appear to move side to side while near the horizon?,"Yesterday while coming out of a restaurant my wife and I noticed what appeared be a satellite passing quite high in the sky. Based on the location, time, and brightness this appears to have been a passing of the GEOS 3 Rocket. What made this unusual is that when it got low (perhaps 25-30 degrees off the horizon) it suddenly appeared to dart side to side (over 15 degree sweeps) multiple times over perhaps a second, while continuing its general western trend, before vanishing.   Since this all happened rather quickly I had to estimate the distances after the fact using my hands and what few reference points were available. It is certainly possible that it was lower in the sky than my estimate as that is always a tricky part to judge. I'm quite certain of the sweep distance but an answer that could explain a smaller sweep could still be very useful.  What could cause a satellite to appear to move side to side in this fashion? "
4087,"Was the discovery of six exoplanets around one star as ""easy"" as counting six peaks in the FT?","The phys.org article Scientists make huge dataset of nearby stars available to public describes the release of a publicly accessible database of Echelle radial velocity measurements; The LCES HIRES/KECK Precision Radial Velocity Exoplanet Survey. See also Keck's HIRES home page.     For two decades, these scientists have pointed HIRES at more than 1,600 ""neighborhood"" stars, all within a relatively close 100 parsecs, or 325 light years, from Earth. The instrument has recorded almost 61,000 observations, each lasting anywhere from 30 seconds to 20 minutes, depending on how precise the measurements needed to be. With all these data compiled, any given star in the dataset can have several days', years', ore even more than a decade's worth of observations.   This part caught my interest especially:     ""We recently discovered a six-planet system orbiting a star, which is a big number,"" Burt says. ""We don't often detect systems with more than three to four planets, but we could successfully map out all six in this system because we had over 18 years of data on the host star."" (emphasis added)   For very simple cases of one, or maybe two planets with minimal interplanetary gravitational interaction, a Fourier transform of a nice, long, continuous radial velocity measurement would show two main peaks, and possibly other artifacts. If the stellar motion induced by each planet were similar magnitude, the analysis might be fairly simple.  But for the six planet case mentioned in the quote (I don't know which one it is), and patchy time coverage (it's a survey) how was this analysis done? Peaks alone? Or just throw it to a supercomputer simulation of every possible combination and let simulated annealing run for a month?  Or was there some 'detective work' involved as well - assumptions, limitations of the fitting space, or even inclusion of other data from outside the study? "
4088,How do we know Nemesis is not a black hole (or neutron star)?,"Nemesis, the hypothetical ""death star"", is supposed to be a massive body that orbits the Sun at long distances and periodically sends comets from the Oort Cloud into the inner solar system. These comets impact the Earth and cause extinction events. It hasn't been found, and the theoretical case for it is not compelling anyway.  My question here is about this curious line from Richard Muller's page at LBL.     Fortunately, several all-sky surveys are underway that should find Nemesis in the next few years, if it is there, and rule out Nemesis if they don't. (Nemesis could hide if it were a black hole, but that is not very plausible.) These surveys include Pan-Starrs and the LSST.   How do we know it's not plausible for Nemesis to be a black hole? For that matter, how do we know it's not a neutron star? "

So that when there is no tilt there can't be any precession?  And are the inclination degrees of the precession and the tilt related or the same?  It seems that the precession causes different possible polarstar, but is the tilt also have effect on this?  Perhaps this above it not right, so what else is the difference? Is perhaps the precession just the changing of the tilt? "
4091,Where do rocks come from?,"Consider a loose pile of rocks in an early solar system, say a tiny asteroid. As it accretes more and more material, the pressure at its center eventually becomes great enough to collapse the gaps between the rocks, which further increases the density, which increases the gravitational force, ... which leads to a runaway process that compacts a loose pile of rubble into a near-spherical body of almost solid rock.  (And some ices and liquids.)  But where do the rocks themselves come from?  Surely at least that much pressure is needed to fuse dust into macroscopic rocks?  Why isn't this a chicken-and-egg problem? "

4093,Can some stars not emit any energy in the visible spectrum?,Stars convert mass into energy. Even converting the slightest mass into energy is immense because the speed of light is so great and [tex]. This means that stars have to emit large amounts of energy.

If so what problems could this star pose? 
4094,What is the gravitational lensing focal distance of a white dwarf star?,"I tried looking this up, but I couldn't find any formula on gravitational lensing distance.   I know that our Sun's is about 550 AU, though further distances work too, as it's not a single focus due to the gravitaional field diminishing over distance from the focusing body.  Is there a reasonably simple formula for calculating distance for a gravitational lens.   I'm specifically curious for white dwarf stars as there's one just 8 light years away and they see like a good object with a good lensing but not super tight focusing like a neutron star or black hole.     For example, if a telescope was built using Sirius B as a focus, how far would the telescope have to be and how powerful might it be (Maybe how powerful should be a separate question but I'll leave it here for now?      Would Sirius B's binary orbit be a hindrance or a benefit, allowing a greater area of focus?   Pure curiosity.   I don't expect we'll get there anytime soon.   "
4095,How can the observable universe shrink in a Big Rip?,"As far as I know, the Big Rip occurs when the scale factor reaches infinity in a finite time. This will only happen in a universe dominated by phantom energy (i.e. a universe with an equation of state of [tex]). However, according to Wikipedia,     A universe dominated by phantom energy is an accelerating universe, expanding at an ever-increasing rate. However, this implies that the size of the observable universe is continually shrinking; the distance to the edge of the observable universe which is moving away at the speed of light from any point moves ever closer. When the size of the observable universe becomes smaller than any particular structure, no interaction by any of the fundamental forces can occur between the most remote parts of the structure. When these interactions become impossible, the structure is ""ripped apart"".   On Wikipedia, there is a ""[why]"" tag, indicating that this wasn't explained very well.  This raises two questions. In a universe dominated by phantom energy, why would the observable universe not continue growing and approaching the cosmic event horizon? After all, its comoving distance is just [tex], so shouldn't it just monotonically increase?  More confusingly, Wikipedia implied that the Big Rip occurs when the observable universe's radius becomes incredibly small and the fundamental forces can no longer hold any structure together, rather than when the scale factor reaches infinity. Am I right in assuming these are separate events, or do they occur at the same time? "

4103,Will we start seeing galaxies disappear due to Universe expansion?,"Does the fact that universe is currently expanding at an accelerating rate means that far far away objects (FAO) might start disappearing with time, set aside the ""red shift""?   I'm saying this because from what I understand until now:   we receive photons from FAO that were emitted long long ago now due to space expansion, some of those objects are now moving away at speed greater than the speed of light, but at the time the photons we receive today were emitted, these FAO where not moving away faster than light   So there must be a point in time at which these far away objects disappear from view. How is this concept called?, or is it only a mistake I'm doing in my thinking?   Here's a simple drawing to illustrate:   at t=-11 billion years(By), photons are emitted in a slow expanding universe, and today we can view the object as it was at t=-2 By, the object moves faster than speed of light, so photon emitted at that time will never reach us, even if we wait the 9 by + ""expansion correction"" needed...

4108,"In zero gravity - I'm floating inside a torus as they spin it up, do I float do the ""ground""?","Imagine this scenario - I'm in a space station with one of those huge torus shaped constructions, that you spin to simulate gravity through centripetal force. But it's turned off right now, so I'm floating in the air.    When happens when they turn it on and it starts spinning? I can imagine what would happen if I was grabbing on to something. I'd be pulled around, and the angular velocity would drag me to the outer part of the torus.

4112,A question related to black holes,"Not a physicist just a simple guy, don't know much about physics as well. Just like to read things. I was reading about black holes and a question popped in my mind.   If I understand it correctly then the black hole is created by collapse of a super massive star at the end of its life. This star will have a finite mass. Then what leads to the black hole to have such massive gravity so that nothing can escape it (because if it was a star before with a finite mass then it would also have some finite gravity, right)?    And then they start absorbing more and more matter. So they grow bigger and bigger. Do black holes die?   Do all galaxies have a black hole at their center?  Thanks &amp; Regards  Update-1  Found answer to the question, do black holes die?  Update-2  Found answer to the question, Do all galaxies have black hole in the center?

4113,How fast are we moving relative to the CMB?,"The cosmic microwave background radiation should provide kind of a global reference frame, because you can determine your speed relative to it using the redshift.  Is it known how fast we are moving in relation to the CMB? If you subtract the various orbital motions (Earth around the Sun, Sun around the Galaxy), are we standing still in the expanding universe, or traveling in a certain direction? "
4114,Photometric redshift - empirical methods (machine learning),"I am currently learning about estimation of photometric redshifts with machine learning methods (or empirical methods in general). These methods use the knowledge about the photometry and the spectroscopic redshift of many galaxies in order to infer a mapping between the photometry and the redshift. Then, based on this mapping, redshifts can be estimated for the photometry of other galaxies.  I've read that for empirical methods it is crucial that the training data (i.e. the data from which the mapping of the photometry to the redshift is inferred) represents the galaxies for which estimated redshifts are desired in the future. I understand that this is crucial, but in what sense does the training data represent a certain distribution and in what sense are other galaxies represented or not represented by this training data? How do I know if a galaxy is well represented by the training data so that I can estimate a redshift for the galaxy?  Would the galaxy have to be from the same region? Does it have to have the same mass? What are the factors to look at, if I want to know whether a galaxy is from the same distribution/is well represented by the training data? "
4115,how are the celestial objects measured?,So I am guessing that chemical composition of the starts is measured using the spectrum analysis of waves emitted by them. But what if the spectrum is super packed by different wave lengths?  How do we calculate the weight of the object?  How do we calculate the size?  How do we calculate the distance and speed of the object?  How are we sure that light traveling towards Earth is not emitted by some other object behind the subject?  I can imagine that error margin in those calculations is super high as the distances and values are also super large. 
4116,Where can I find permissibly licensed database of stars and constellations?,"I'm working on a game engine of sorts, and one thing I did for a previous game which was under the GPL was I had a night sky with the constellations visibly connected and I'd like to do that again.  I don't know where my data set originally came from but I do have a note that it was GPL, so it likely came from Stellarium, which is GPL licensed.  For this I need the dataset to come from the public domain, us government, permissively licensed, etc.  If possible I'm after the coordinates in the sky, brightness, maybe class and name, but also some mechanism to know which stars would be connected in classic constellations.    I've found some data sets which contain the star data I'm after, though they would take some effort to parse and pull out the data I'm after, but I can't seem to find anywhere online, except stellarium, which provides star constellation connectivity. Any ideas?  I've gotten this list so far from what I can tell:   Stellarium: Has everything. GPL (Really restrictive) But has things like a constellationship file, i.e. [website]HYG: Great database, has everything I want, but licensed under restrictive CC 2.5 SA [website]BSC5: No explicit license, but created from NASA/ADC, data should be public domain.  Good data set, difficult to parse, no star connectivity.  (Best candidate for raw star database) UCAC5: Navy (public domain), data set not geared for visible light. HIP (used by Stellarium for stars) - Difficult to parse through, ESA (correct license) [website]Are there any standards of what stars make up the primary connections in constellations?  Or does it just happen to be whoever puts it together?  P.S. If I ever do succeed, I will release the database (probably 3-4k stars is all I will need with connectivity) under the MIT license to permit inclusion in any commercial or noncommercial projects. "
4117,Are all planets/galaxies moving away from *us*?,"From what I can see in a physics textbook page (on redshift), it seems to imply that all planets/galaxies emit red, rather than blue waves (for red-shift).  Wouldn't this mean that everything is moving away from us and that we're the centre of the Big Bang? (See quote from the book below)  On a similar note, does everything move at the same speed away from the centre of the Universe? - If not, then wouldn't that mean that we'd see a few planets/galaxies that emit blue, as they are traveling with a greater velocity from the centre than we are (with it being closer to the centre) and that they are 'catching up' with us?  It's not a big deal and I don't need to know it, but I would like to know, if possible.  ~StratusGold  Quoting the textbook: ""When we look at light from distant galaxies, we find that the wavelength has increased. The wavelengths are longer than they should be - they're shifted towards the red end of the spectrum. This is called red-shift. (...omitted...) Measurements of the red-shift indicate that these galaxies are moving away from us (receding) very quickly - and it's the same result whichever direction you look in"" - CGP GCSE AQA 9-1 Physics Revision Guide, Topic 8 'Space Physics', Pg 102 "

I've plotted the start times below.   There are four groups that last about 45 minutes, each followed by a break of either 45 minutes or 90+45 minutes, is this related to the HST's orbit?  I notice a slow rotation of the star tracks over the duration of the roughly seven hours of data, it looks like roughly 20 degrees, (see GIF or the individual images) and I can't figure that out at all. Is it a rotation of the HST around its own axis? Individual preview images (example) appear to be rhomboidal rather than square, why?    "

4122,Can we calculate the orbit of exoplanets?,"I'm not an astronomer, but the question came up and I'm interested if we are able (or how accurate we are able) to calculate the orbital parameters of an exoplanet. Since the transit method must yield some properties of its orbit, we must know some of it. I also found some information here regarding the measurement of the orbital plane (Can we know the orbital planes of extraterrestrial planetary bodies?).  But do we have a clear picture of its orbit? Like we have of the planets in our system?  Could we, for example, tell if the planet was born in this system or has been caught by it at some point (giving it a different orbit I suppose)? "
4123,Astrochemistry - what does freeze-out mean?,"I was recently watching a video on the physics and chemistry in planetary accretion disks, and the speaker at a certain point mentioned 'freeze-out and UV dissociation'.

4124,"Would we have more than 8 minutes of light, if the sun ""went out""?","The common theory is, that if the Sun ""shut down"", we would see the light for eight more minutes (the time that it takes the photons to reach the Earth).   However recently I have read that photons need around 100 000 years to reach the Earth, since the reactions are happening at Sun's core, and gamma rays can't leave the Sun without interacting with other particles, unlike neutrinos for example.  Is that theory correct? If the Sun's core ""shut down"", would we still receive photons (light) for another 100 000 years, with only neutrinos disappearing immediately? "
4125,Did I see a meteor or a re-entry?,"Last night (January 21, possibly 5:30 UTC), from my house in northern California, I saw a moving point of light in the sky, going west to east, crossing about 120 degrees of sky in 5 seconds or so.  It didn't look like my experience of meteors - thicker and slower, and quite bright. I think it survived until it was out of sight entirely, rather than burning out.   Aerospace.org's reentry predictions doesn't show anything for that time.   I've seen ISS and other satellites; this was a lot larger and brighter, and my favorite satellite pass schedule also shows nothing.   Was this more likely a rocket body re-entry, or a large meteor? "
4126,Does it make more sense to upgrade our existing telescope or to buy a new one?,"We're at a bit of a crossroads here, since we're faced with what appears to be a tough choice.   We've got a Celestron 11"" SCT tube with a Losmandy G11 equatorial mount, all bought in 1996. The mount has motors, but they're only capable of 5 tracking programs (Moon, deep space, etc). The tracking also doesn't appear to work quite well at the moment, but we may be able to fix that on our own.  We may, however, have an opportunity to acquire funding for an upgrade. We could upgrade the mount (or buy a new one), so that it is completely computerised and is capable of finding and tracking objects with ease. For that upgrade we've been given a ballpark of 2000$. I don't know where the number comes from, but let's assume we can have the desired upgrade with that sum.   Now, here's the question - wouldn't that money be better spent on buying another telescope, e.g. a Celestron Evolution 8 (same price range), which is already computerised, and is overall much easier to use? I realise there's a difference between 11"" and 8"", but I've had the opportunity to compare them in field and for our purposes, I couldn't find it.  We are a small astronomy club. Our activities with the telescope hardly go outside the scope of amateur astronomy - we look at the Moon, Saturn, Jupiter, sometimes Mars. We do sometimes look at, e.g. the Orion nebula, but so far that's the extent of our endeavours. We do not expect to transition to astrophotography, beyond what can be achieved with DIY solutions, nor do we use the telescope for research or data acquisition.  All things considered, which option - the upgrade to our existing telescope, or to buy a new one? "
4127,"Exoplanets, Protoplanets, and planetesimals","So, most of the mass of the solar system (that isn't inside the sun) is inside Jupiter. And most of whats left after THAT is inside Saturn. So, all the rocky planets, moons, and asteroids in our solar system are a tiny minority of the mass.   Now, we're looking at other solar systems for Exoplanets, and mostly finding gas giants. But not every system has one that we can detect- even some of the nearby systems. Which implies that there are plenty of systems without a Gas Giant.  Unless I'm misunderstanding things, the amount of raw material in those systems should be fairly similar to ours. So what, realistically, would those systems have in terms of planets? Without the massive gas giants to suck up all the mass, they'd presumably have lots of smaller objects, right? Massive asteroid belts, large numbers of small planetoids? Are there any models of what those systems are likely to look like? "

4131,Look up current positions and velocities of solar system objects,"I am working on an orbital dynamics code and, for fun, I would like to model the Sun-Earth-Moon system with my code.  I can look up the masses of each object just fine, as well as average distances and relative velocities (which I can also calculate).  However, I would like to model the Sun-Earth-Moon system in great detail.  I would like to know the positions and velocities of each object on any given day (today works just fine) so that I can represent the orbits of these objects with great accuracy, hopefully even reproducing their actual ellipticity.  Where can I find values for:   current Sun-Earth distance current Earth-Moon distance current Sun-Moon angular separation current velocity of Earth relative to Sun (or relative to Sun-Earth(-Moon?) center of mass) current velocity of Moon relative to Earth   and, maybe even   current velocity of Sun relative to Sun-Earth(-Moon?) center of mass.   Is there any resource that provides these current values? "
4132,Right Ascension for epoch 2000 - physical location?,"I understand that Right Ascension is a longitude-like celestial coordinate that varies from 0-24hrs, taken from a reference point of the vernal equinox. More specifically, for star maps that are based on the epoch 2000.0, this specifically means when the vernal equinox occurred in the year 2000. Even more specifically, the vernal equinox is a specific time and date, and location of the exact point in time, when sunrise occurred, of when the day and night were exactly equal in length. Here are my questions:  1) If the Right Ascension is referenced from “Vernal Equinox” position “0hr”, in the year 2000, then why does nobody ever talk about the equivalent physical location? ie: if the right ascension (sunrise of the vernal equinox) occurred in the year 2000 in a particular city, or longitude, why doesn’t anyone ever mention that. ie: (just an example) Right Ascension is always measured from longitude -80deg (close to Miami, Florida, USA), as this was a city the vernal equinox occurred in the year 2000?  2) If the star maps do not change much within a period of a few decades, (eg: take for example, the right ascension and declination of the sirius star is pretty much the same in 2019 as it was in the epoch 2000, or 1990 for that matter), then these RA and dec values should not change much within a decade or so. Ipso facto, we can deduce that the sunrise time for the vernal equinox should not change very much from year to year. ie: Since RA is measured from a reference based on the sunrise of the vernal equinox in the year 2000, then the sunrise of the vernal equinox in the year 2019 should not be very much different (assuming RA is the same today as it was in 2000). But it isn’t!!! If you track the sunrise of the vernal equinox from year to year, it varies a lot! I am obviously missing something… it’s driving me nuts.  Update below:  From Norton’s 2000.0 star atlas, please see the following definitions:  Norton's 2000 Star Atlas Excerpt 1/3  Norton's 2000 Star Atlas Excerpt 2/3   Norton's 2000 Star Atlas Excerpt 3/3  In the last link, It says the 0 line of right ascension is equivalent to the Greenwich meridian on Earth.  In a sense, this is the ultimate answer to my question #1, although it begs more details.  In Astronomy, why is this rarely mentioned?  If it was, star maps would be much easier to comprehend by anyone.  (Ie: RA of any star is simply referenced from the Earth equivalent of longitude 0…).    Does this also mean, that during the vernal equinox, the point in time where the sun crosses from the Southern Hemisphere to the Northern hemisphere, longitude 0 meridian on Earth is directly at that intersecting point too?  So, as Mike G said, “sunrise"" is irrelevant on the day of the vernal equinox.   I understand this part.  But the exact moment of the vernal equinox does matter… because from any point on Earth, the stars all move in the sky as time progresses, hour by hour.  If you’re going to base a map of where the stars are, it has to be referenced from one moment in time, and from once longitudinal reference (and one declination reference).  Now, bringing it all back to star maps:  @Mike G: Would you say that simply, any star map based on J2000 epoch is basically where all the stars were on Jan 1, 2000 (at 12 noon greenwich time)?  However, you also mentioned the J2000 epoch does NOT depend on the equinox.  This is where I go fuzzy.  From reading the reference links above, it seems like it does depend on the equinox.  If the J2000 epoch star maps are indeed referenced from 12 noon, then in the year 2000, at the time of vernal equinox, the greenwich meridian intersection occurred  at 12 noon?    Update 2   OK, I think I have some of my basic misconceptions cleared.  RA 0hr simply cannot be measured relative to any point on Earth.  It is measured against the first point of Pisces (It used to be Aries a long time ago).  Specifically, for J2000 star maps, the RAs would be calculated based on relative positions from Pisces in the year 2000 around March 21 (vernal equinox). (Norton's Atlas -2nd link above- describes RA as around this date.   I found no reference for January 1 -please correct me if this is not the case).   So to summarize what I understand, if you're only given an RA and declination for a particular star and you wanted to find it in the sky, you would need to innately know where Pisces is.  From there, you can roughly work out approximately how many degrees of ""longitude"" away from Pisces your star is.  (So, you would also need to know where due North and due South are).  You would also have to know what latitude you are at on Earth, so you can work out roughly where your star's declination places it on it's meridian in the sky.  For example, if you knew you lived at +40deg latitude on Earth, and you looked straight up at the zenith, you could estimate that the horizons are at about +90deg and -90deg away from that +40deg position. For there, you could interpolate where on the meridian (declination) your star lies.  Update 3   Thanks Mike G for the wiki reference to Celestial Coordinates.  This shows that the star atlas J2000 is NOT referenced to the vernal equinox, but simply references to a snapshot in time of the stars on January 1, 2000, noon terrestrial time (or 2000 January 1, 11:58:55.816 UTC, which was the old greenwich mean time).  The RAs and Decs in the atlas are referenced to Pisces at that moment in time.  "
4133,Understanding The Fluctuations In The CMB Maps,"If I'm understanding this correctly the fluctuations in CMB are a result of the ""last scatter"" of photons when electrons joined together with nuclei that before this formed plasma. CMB is among other things used to see the early matter density fluctuations of the early universe, right?  So, how is this seen? Are the warmer parts in the maps where the matter is most dense? And are these spots warmer because more photons are coming from that spot, or because of some other reason? "
4134,What's special about Saturn that it has distinctive rings?,"This may overlap with other questions, but I'm asking what is unique about Saturn in location, properties, etc that is has far more pronounced rings?   It's between Jupiter and Uranus and Neptune in size and position.  So what's special?  Is there some Goldilocks zone of rings formation?   Or is it just an accident of history? "
4135,Why do we need to add a second to 30 June and risk upsetting Internet?,"We linked a physical constant (the time of one second) to a physical non constant (the rotation of the earth) so there will have to be adjustments - or not? Is it important that the UTC in one line on earth is the same as the astronomical time? As the earth slows down, it means that this line slowly changes position. When the line travels 1 hour away we can bring it back by an hour change if necessary. If currently we add 1 second say every 3 years, it would take thousands of years to change by 1 hour. The last time a second was added, in 2012, problems were caused in some systems. Why do we need to do it? "
4136,Why does the Solar Wind consist of charged particles?,"The Wikipedia article on Solar Wind gives the following explanation:     The solar wind is a stream of charged particles released from the upper atmosphere of the Sun, called the corona. This plasma mostly consists of electrons, protons and alpha particles with kinetic energy between 0.5 and 10 keV.   If the solar wind consists of both electrons and protons, why don't they combine and give Hydrogen or any other elements? Then, why would Solar Wind be charged? Is that because of the high kinetic energy of the ejected particles? If yes, let us consider a proton and an electon. They must be of almost the same energy if so there will be no relative kinetic energy, so I think they must combine in the same way as if they were at rest or in motion at small velocities. "
4137,What does it mean to say 'space exists?',"From another question I posted, I learned that not only was matter created from the Big Bang, but more importantly, space itself.  What does it mean for space to be created?  Does it exist in the same way substances exist?  In other words, what do we mean by 'space exists?' "
4138,Why do J2000 coordinates change with time in Stellarium?,"I'm new to the field so I'm sure this is a basic misunderstanding. As I currently understand it, J2000 equatorial coordinates describe the position of objects by referencing a specific point in time (12:00 Jan 1st 2000) to account for the effect of the precessional cycle in the reference point for RA. Presumably this means that the same object measured on different dates should still have the same J2000 coordinates?  In Stellarium, if I look at the RA/Dec (J2000) of a star on one date, then compare to the previous year the J2000 coordinates don't match:     I also notice that if I set the current date/time to 12:00 1/1/2000 the RA/Dec (J2000) and RA/Dec (on date) values are different when I would have expected them to be the same:    Where am I going wrong here? "
4139,"Questions about a fictional binary system, and habitability","Note: Questions are at the bottom. The rest had simply been written in a format to better organize my thoughts. The formulas used to construct this fictional solar system, had been borrowed from Artefxian and are presented in several of his videos.   Theoretical: A P-Type binary star system featuring a gas giant on or near the habitable zone, with a habitable moon.  Considerations:      Gas giant would need a stable magnetosphere. Jupiter and Saturn may be useful examples.  The moon's mass must be great enough to sustain an atmosphere. In this instance, a nitrogen/oxygen atmosphere. It is estimated that a moon with a mars-like density, would need at least 7% of Earth's mass in order to support such an atmosphere for several billion years. Both gas giant and the habitable moon must maintain stable orbit. Simulations would suggest that, to maintain a stable orbit to a gas giant, or a brown dwarf that orbits 1 AU from a sun-like star, would require a moon orbital period of less than 45 - 60 days.    The moon itself must be capable of generating it's own magnetosphere in order to deflect stellar wind and the gas giants' naturally generated radiation belts.   There is a high likelihood that the moon would be tidally locked with it's parent world. Monoj Joshi, Robert Haberle, and their colleagues suggest that the effect of tidal heating could support conditions amenable to habitability. Additionally, tidal effects may allow for plate tectonics, causing volcanic activity and a regulation of the moon's surface temperature. The potential, resulting geodynamo effect would allow for a strong magnetic field.   Balance: The moon should be large enough to support tectonic activity, dense enough to support a strong protective magnetosphere, close enough to the gas giant to maintain stable orbit, and be far enough away that it's own magnetosphere may better protect from sputtering caused by it's parent worlds' radiation belts.   It is suggested that the larger and more dense a terrestrial, water-rich world, the further out it's habitable zone extends.   Fictional Data: Star A: Mass = 1.1; Luminosity = 1.39; Diameter = 1.07; Surface Temperature = 1.04 Star B: Mass = 0.9; Luminosity = 0.69; Diameter = 0.92; Surface Temperature = 0.94 Separation: 0.3 AU Barycenter: 0.45/0.225 AU Eccentricity: 0.4/0.5 Separation Minimum: 0.27/0.1125 Separation Maximum: 0.63/0.3375 Separation Overall: 0.9/0.45 Inner Boundary: 0.2 AU Outer Boundary: 80 AU Frostline: 6.984 AU Inner Habitable Zone: 1.976 AU Outer Habitable Zone: 2.808 AU Ideal Position: 1.8 AU Inner Forbidden ""Hell"" Zone: 0.3 AU Outer Forbidden ""Hell"" Zone: 1.35 AU    Goal: Create a fictional, theoretical system which can be demonstrated as stable, in which an earth analog may safely orbit a gas giant.  Further Considerations:      The moon does not necessarily need to be an earth analog, and may simply be demonstrated as habitable to human life. The gas giant does not necessarily need to be within the habitable zone, and may cradle the outer limits of the CMZ, or be further out provided it can be demonstrated that the orbiting moon could feasibly support human life unassisted by technology. i.e. Robin Crusoe could become stranded on the moon, and survive.    Questions:   How far would the moon have to orbit from it's parent body, to prevent tidal locking?   How can I find a balance, between the binary stars' gravitational pull, the gas giant's gravitational pull, and the chaos it may play on the moon?   If no balance can be met, I will accept tidal locking with the moon. In this instance, how can I go about determining a safe and stable orbiting distance for the moon?   How can I determine the effect of the gas giants' magnetosphere on the moon? What would the math behind it look like?   Are there any considerations I may be missing, and how would they affect this scenario?  "

Also did search the already asked question, but didn't see anything on the subject.  What does bolded item in the names below stand for? How do they choose them?   VY Canis Majoris NML Cygni UY Scuti  "
4142,Why do we expect Type Ia Supernovae to be brighter in a decelerating Universe than what has been observed?,"This seminal review paper in the PNAS by Robert P. Kirshner ([website]  If the universe had been decelerating—–in the way it would if it contained the closure density of matter, that is, if Ωm = 1—then the light emitted at redshift z = 0.5 by a SN Ia would not have traveled as far, compared with a situation where the universe had been coasting at a constant rate—characteristic of an empty universe, where Ωm = 0. For a universe with Ωm = 1, the flux from the distant supernova therefore would be ≈25% brighter. But the distant supernovae are not brighter than expected in a coasting universe, they are dimmer. For this to happen, the universe must be accelerating while the light from the supernova is in transit to our observatories.   I didn't understand this.  Why do we expect Type Ia Supernovae at a particular distance to be more or less brighter based on the matter density of the Universe?  In other words, why should the brightness of anything at a particular distance  depend on whether the Universe was accelerating or not?   "
4143,What are dark matter and dark energy?,"I've recently read about dark matter and dark energy. But unfortunately, there were not enough answers for me. The article I read was more of a hypothesis than a real answer. So I'm asking for all the information that you have and all the things you know about dark matter and dark energy. For example:   What is it? Why does it exist? Where is it? From what does it form?  "
4144,Starting a fire in a cold planet that was full of flammable gas,"What would happen to a cold planet that has a large amount of flammable gas, like Neptune, if we throw some fire into it? Will it burn, or would the flame be extinguished due to the cold? "
4145,Is there an element of chance/chaos in stellar evolution?,"Since stars are an ideal example of macroscopic objects, is their evolution  determined by their initial mass and metallicity?  Are there any non-trivial random internal processes going on that may significantly affect a star's development and eventual fate? (It is quite evident that capture of another star or a brown dwarf is an external, exogenous event.)  EDIT/clarification: I'm looking for things that may shorten/extend the lifetime of a star beyond the ""norm"" prescribed by nuclear physics/gravity, change its composition, surface temperature. Solar flares/quakes and other instabilities come to mind first. "
4146,"Do objects look larger the further away they are, beyond z=1?",I stumbled upon this text which illustrates and says:     We find that as the object is moved to higher redshifts its angular   size first decreases (as naively expected) but soon begins to increase   after passing through a minimum value.   Is this correct for the mainstream standard model? What would an English language explanation be? 
4147,How much damage would collision with a similar mass primordial black hole do to earth?,"All this talk of Planet 9 perhaps being a primordial black hole (PBH) made me wonder how dangerous a PBH collision with earth would really be.   Specifically, if earth collided with a PBH of 1 earth mass, traveling fast enough that they didn't end up orbiting each other, what would happen?  Edit: From a paper asking Can one detect passage of small black hole through the Earth? the analysis was that for an approximately proton-volume and mountain-mass sized PBH     ""It creates a long tube of heavily radiative damaged material, which   should stay recognizable for geological time.""   but is otherwise pretty hard to detect.   What would change if the PBH were the mass of the earth and the volume of a baseball? How slow would it have to be going before it really messed things up? "
4148,Why is it hard to reconcile Gaia DR2 with the HIP data set,"I'm trying to get a database of about 20 million of the brightest stars in the sky for a project I'm working on, and I want to reconcile it with the Hipparcos data set.  Currently, I'm only using the HIP dataset for everything, especially the constellations, additionally, as far as I understand, the DR2 data set doesn't have the brightest stars.   My confusion is that for many stars, there is an easy one-to-one correlation, i.e. at 104.304832, 57.563355, I see a magnitude 4.613 star.  This star appears in the HIP dataset as a 6.150 magnitude star.  Roughly the same parallax.  But, if I look at 102.733851, 57.649038, at the 7.44 magnitude star, I see nothing at all in the HIP dataset.   Honestly, most of the stars I'm trying to correlate between the two data sets do not appear.  Is RA/DEC defined differently between the two data sets?  Are they intended to be used as concatenated data sets?  I'd really like to use DR2 to refine the parallax mappings from the HIP data set because for my project estimated distance is so critical. "
4149,What is the history of the Milky Way's relationship with Andromeda?,"From what I've read, the Milky Way will collide with Andromeda in about 4 - 5 billion years, and a billion or so years after that the two will merge and become a giant elliptical galaxy.   What I'm wondering is what the history, orbital dynamics wise, of these two galaxies is? What's set them on the collision course that they now find themselves on? How has the distance between the two varied over time? Could past mergers have robbed one of the two or both of the angular momentum necessary to keep them from colliding?  "
4150,Quantum death of stars,"This comes from a comment on this question, to quote:     The death of (large mass) stars is also based on quantum events with probabilities technically not 1 (and is very fast), so it is technically possible for a star not to die in a way it really ought to by sheer chance.   The question is what quantum events are involved in the death of a star (likely and unlikely)? If many of these very unlikely quantum events happened at the same time all over the star, how could the death of a star differ form the typical nova or simply cooling down? "
4151,Does Gravitational Time Dilation stack on top of Time Dilation caused by Velocity?,"Using 1 CM from the Event Horizon of Super Massive Black Hole, SGR A, as the reference point. The particles within the accretion disk are traveling at extreme high speeds.  Assume this speed increases as the particles orbit closer and closer to the EH.   Are the particles within the accretion disk of Super Massive BH SGR A subject to time dilation both from 1) the gravitational field of SGR A at 1 cm from Event Horizon ...and 2) from the the acceleration of the particles traveling around the BH as they approach the EH?     Does the acceleration of particles act as an interference to the affects of the gravitational time dilation?  And if not, or if these two types of time dilation affect the time intervals for this group of particles,  When would an observer 1 light year from the EH see the particles enter the EH?  A) Before Impacting the EH, B) After impacting the EH,  or C) Never?   "
4152,How was Cassini able to measure and use the Earth-Mars distance to get the Earth-Sun distance?,How was Cassini able to measure and use he distance between Earth and Mars to get the Earth-Sun distance? How were the ratios of Earth-Mars and Earth-Sun calculated then? Given Kepler's laws all we need to now find is orbital period? How did they manage to do this without distance? 
4153,What would happen if a wormhole gets swallowed by a black hole?,"Assume wormholes exist. One hole allows matter to pop out of another hole somewhere else in the universe.  If one end of the wormhole is swallowed by a black hole, then no information can get from that end to the other hole.  If the wormhole acts as some kind of gateway to another part of the universe, wouldn't that mean that the entire universe would be swallowed by the black hole? ie. the wormhole end is an entry portal to the entire universe, so if that is inside the black hole, wouldn't that mean the entire universe is then in the black hole? "
4154,Does plasma recombination in the solar wind happen to any significant or measurable degree?,Comments below this answer to Why does the Solar Wind consist of charged particles? have led me to ask the following:  Question: Does plasma recombination in the solar wind happen to any significant or measurable degree? 
4155,"As days get longer, why isn't the added daylight split evenly between sunrise and sunset?","I have a basic understanding of the sinusoidal relationship of the rate of change of daylight as the year goes on. But it seems intuitive that the changes should be equally split between sunrise and sunset.  For my location, Bend Or., todays sunrise/sunset is: 07:40 and 16:43 And for January 31st it is: 07:24 and 17:14  So sunrise will be 16 minutes earlier and sunset will be 31 minutes later. It appears that there is twice the added daylight to sunset than to sunrise. Why aren't the differences equivalent? "
4156,Can fish and other sea creatures survive in watery planets like Neptune or any other planets that has water?,"I'm a bit curious since Neptune does not have a land surface and it is covered with water, I mean water has oxygen right? What will happen if we put some sea creatures in these watery planets? Can they survive or live? I'm not referring to Neptune alone, I mean all the planets that has some large amount of water in it. Thanks. "
4157,ra for sun vs stars,"There is formula for stars sideral time:  [tex]  where [tex] - is right of ascension at the vernal equinox.  [tex] = latitude  [tex] = declination  Is it applicable for the sun with 0 [tex] and 0 [tex]? If not, why not?  I want to use Need Simple equation for Rise, Transit, and Set time to get setting time and rising time of a star to code.   for(int m=1;m&lt;100;m++){ ts =2*M_PI*m+ (ra - acos(-tan(dec)*tan(lat))); // angle on each day iterating m d=(ts-4.894961212735792 - longitude)/(6.30038809898489); printf(""%f since midnight"", (d-0.5)/24); // d - 0.5 to handle midnight }    I am not sure if my iteration is ok d - 0.5   "
4158,Do Electric Charges in the Van Allen Radiation belt move in Opposite Directions?,"The Wikipedia Article on Van Allen Radiation Belt gives the following explanation:     A Van Allen radiation belt is a zone of energetic charged particles, most of which originate from the solar wind, that are captured by and held around a planet by that planet's magnetic field.   The term ""energetic charged particles"" hinted to me that these charges are in motion and in very large velocities.   Let us assume, a small portion of space in the Van Allen Radiation Belt, compared to the size of Earth. We can assume the magnetic field in this space to be uniform due to our previous assumption. From the formula for finding Magnetic force on moving charges, [tex] where [tex] is the magnetic force on the charged particle, [tex] is the electric charge of the particle with an appropriate sign, [tex] is the velocity vector and [tex] is the magnetic field vector.  As per the above formula, the direction of force is dependant on the nature of charge as well as the direction given by the cross product. If we consider the charged particles to move with uniform speed, the net force acting on the charge must be equal to zero. I think we must neglect the gravitational force exerted by Earth on the charges since the mass of charges is negligible. The two forces, Centrifugal force and the magnetic force (exerted by Earth's magnetic field due to the motion of the charged particles) cancel each other when they have the same magnitude but opposite direction. From the formula, it is also evident that the direction of force changes with the sign of the charge. It must be opposite for positive and negative charges.   So, based on this is it correct to assume, if the positive charges orbit the earth in one direction the negative charges orbit the earth in the opposite direction? Do they really orbit Earth in opposite directions?  The following image (a view from the top of poles of Earth) depicts my idea on the sense (clockwise or anticlockwise) of rotation of charges in the Van Allen Radiation Belt:    Image Source : My own work :) "
4159,IRAF: Identify task,"I am trying to perform wavelength calibration on an image but I am stuck by the identify task under the longslit package. So when I type :go on the command line after I set the parameters (see the first image), I get a weird output (See the second image) instead of an output that looks like the one on the third image. Do you perhaps know why it's doing that? I am running IRAF on my MacBook Air laptop.

4160,"Why is the Eagle Nebula so ""static""?","This, of course, is a newbie question, as I am nothing more than a hobbyist. But I was quite surprised to see the recently-released ""before and after"" pictures of the so-called ""Pillars of Creation"" in the Eagle Nebula (here and here). For something that looks like such a ""nebulous"" cloud of gas (pardon the pun), I would have expected at least some visible sign of change in the 25 years between the two photos. But at the pixel resolution which I had available, I could not detect even the slightest difference between them. Of course, I am accustomed to terrestrial clouds which are in constant motion, so I (mistakenly?) expected something analogous at the astronomical level. Can someone provide, in layman's terms, how my understanding of this cosmological feature is deficient? In other words, how might I adjust my instinctive intuition that this object should be more dynamic? Is it just the sheer scale that I am not comprehending? (By the way: what is the distanse between the three spires, as compared to, say, our solar system?) "
4161,"How to calculate the orbital velocity, the high-orbit (quasigeostationary) holding force and the shadow of the disk on Earth?","[]  The following data are given:  •   The circular orbit of the disk D (quasigeostationary orbit) parallel to the geostationary orbit. •   Located 4,505 km to the north of the equatorial plane, above the 45 degree parallel. The radius of orbit with respect to the gravitational center of the Earth 41,922 km (calculated by the uhoh we thank) •   Disc diameter: 10 km. •   The disc consists of a support frame and solar panels. The specific weight approx. 4.5 kg per square meter. •   The time when the disc makes a complete, retrograde motion, around the earth: 25 hours.  Required:  1 Orbital speed of the disk so as to achieve a complete circular motion in 25 hours.  2 The force required to  maintain the disk in orbit and to compensate gravitational attraction. 2.1 How can this force be assured? 2,2 with thermochemical propellants (rockets with liquid fuel that could be started periodically? 2.3 electromagnetic, ionic, photonic propellants with cold gases. 2.4 And so on  3   What is the diameter of the disk shadow on the Earth's surface?  Figures 1: 2 and 3 graphically reflect the problem.  Any critical comments or comments are welcome.   enter image description here enter image description here "
4162,If an asteroid twice the size of Earth passed super close would half of the Earth be pulled towards it?,"So let's say that an asteroid the twice the size of Earth passed by going relatively slow say in between the Moon and Earth.  Among so many other things (and perhaps you can touch on some of the biggest 'other' things), would anything on the asteroid's side of Earth be essentially 'sucked' towards the asteroid. That is if I am standing outside and it passes would I lift off the ground and float towards it?   Conversely, would things on the opposite side experience two times the standard weight? That is if I am standing on the other side, would I feel heavier as the asteroid passes?  I realise there would be many other devastating effects but I'm most interested in this one...  The possible answer I suspect is that objects on Earth will not 'feel' anything as the Earth as a whole will move towards the asteroid and not every little thing inside Earth... "
4163,How can I predict space directions?,Did the Neptune and Pluto trajectories ever cross or was it a mere reclassification? Do studies say that I can predict an intersection between 2 trajectories  or movements based on data now? Do I have to consider at least 3 solid or larger space bodies moving in a way like the 3-body problem? 
4164,Hohmann transfer orbit (Earth-Jupiter system),Consider the Hohmann transfer orbit of a probe launched from Earth to Jupiter. Assume the orbits of Earth and Jupiter are circular.  I want to calculate the following:   The semi-major axis and eccentricity of Hohmann transfer orbit from Earth to Jupiter. The speed of the probe at Earth. The launch speed of the probe from Earth to reach Jupiter. The duration of the flight to Jupiter. The elongation of Jupiter at launch to ensure that the probe arrives at Jupiter.   Here my attempt:   [tex] I am thinking of using the vis-viva equation but I don't know what I should use for [tex]? Should I use [tex] = 1 AU for [tex] where [tex] is the average distance from the Earth to the Sun? Am I right? Please correct me if I am wrong. I am thinking of using the escape velocity formula where [tex] is the mass of the Earth and [tex] is the radius of the Earth. Please correct me if I am wrong. [tex]. I really don't know how to do this question. Please help.  
4165,Collision of two Earths,"Assume that two Earth-like planets orbited the same star, with elliptic orbits. Eventually, something occurs that caused the two planets to collide.   What would be the outcome of such a catastrophe? I figure that both planets (and any life if it exists) would be destroyed, but exactly how?   Would both planets explode, combine together into a larger planet, or be able to rebound and either reestablish an orbit or be pulled into the sun? "
4166,How would I define mass in a space,"I always heard that mass is a measure of inertia during my school days. Is this  applicable to bodies which are in space ? Suppose there is space craft in a space; how would I define mass ? I read some article and consulted with my teachers; they said mass is similar to conservation of momentum but I do not know how. And then he said mass is independent of frame it is constant, whereas I see momentum is itself a frame dependent quantity and velocity is frame dependent. I am confused how I would actually define a mass in space, what is the correct definition for a mass ?   I am high school boy, I will be thankful if anybody answer my question.  "
4167,Do Roche limits apply to black holes?,"Consider black hole A, a super massive black hole at the center of the galaxy. Orbiting it is black hole B, a much less massive black hole.  If some passing body were to modify black hole B's orbit such that it fell within the Roche limit of black hole A, what would happen to black hole B?  If it were to turn into a ring, would the black hole matter re-inflate since it wouldn't be under such high gravity? Do black holes even respond to Roche limits like regular matter does? "
4168,Time dilation due to the expansion of the universe,"This is not a homework question. I want some help in being able to clearly perceive the expansion of the universe and the consequences thereof.  We know that the universe is expanding in an accelerated manner. It is my understanding that space alone cannot expand without affecting the local time. Thus as per GTR, depending on the curvature of space-time and the energy density, time too shall suffer a change due to the changing space.  Assuming that there is no curvature of space-time and no mass or energy contained in a chunk of space (assuming the zero point energy of empty space as zero) between two galaxies A and B, let us say that the local time at a point P in this space goes as [tex]. If we on Earth could somehow observe this point and measure the time at P as [tex],    When we talk about the rate of expansion for example as in Hubble's Law, do we follow the comoving coordinates or the proper coordinates? How would [tex] and [tex] relate to each other if the rate of expansion is uniform and accelerating respectively? How much is 1s for the comoving observer at the inflation period in terms of the usual 1s now on Earth?  "
4169,How do or could radio telescopes contribute to exoplanet studies?,Current and upcoming telescopes which find exoplanets and take spectra of their atmospheres seem to be optical or infrared. What about radio telescopes applied to exoplanets? They are larger and more easy to use with interferometry. Why aren't radio frequencies as useful as optical/IR for exoplanet studies? 
4170,Overhead (galactic North) view of the stars in and around the Vela Constellation with distance,"I am working on a project and would like to have a star map--seen from ""above"" (Galactic North?) that calls out the stars in the Vela constellation and shows their distance from sol / earth.  I realize that any 2D map will not show the Z-axis, but I'm okay with that (especially if there's a notation).  I want to be able to show which stars in the Vela constellation are closer to earth vs. further away.  Is there anything like this? I've looked and can't find it. "
4171,Thermal Doppler broadening,"How to plot Doppler profile corresponding to the spectral line? The spectral line was plotted from data: flux with respect to wavelenght and I know the temperature.   These two function are Doppler profile? What should I substitue for [tex], [tex] and [tex]. These values are from wavelenght according to [tex]?      [website]Or could you recommend me another formula for plotting Doppler profile? "
4172,How Wide is Earth's Roche Limit?,"My question is simple:  Given the gravitational relationship between Earth and the moon, how wide is Earth's roche limit?  How close does the moon have to orbit before getting disintegrated by Earth's gravitational pull, and how far does it have to orbit before being free from Earth's orbit entirely? "
4173,How can an accretion disk form around the central star of a planetary nebula?,"I was reading the 2012 paper A tidally destructed massive planet as the progenitor of the two light planets around the sdB star KIC 05807616 about the possible origin of two exoplanets that orbit a subdwarf B star. The researchers suggested that they could have been formed by the fragmentation of the metal core of a gas giant that was orbiting the star while it was still in the main sequence. Just at the moment when it became a red giant and absorbed the planet, which was fragmented by tidal forces when it reached the core.  Here is an excerpt from the summary:     We suggest the following alternative scenario for the formation of the two planets (section 2). A single massive planet of mass [tex] went through the CE evolution inside the RGB envelope. It spiralled all the way to the center. The released gravitational energy is behind the removal of the stellar envelope, as is commonly the case with CE evolution. The massive planet reached the tidal destruction radius (eq. 1). The gaseous mass of the planet was lost and part of it formed a temporary accretion disk around the core, that now is the EHB star. The metallic core of the massive planet was tidally destructed into several Earth-like bodies immediately after the gaseous envelope was removed. Different bodies had different energy per unit mass. Some of them spiral-in and were further destructed by the core, while other survived at orbital separations of [tex] within the gaseous disk. The bodies interacted with the disk and among themselves and migrated, as planets around young stars do. Two of the bodies survived and reached an almost resonance. These are the observed Earth-like planets.   I infer that at the time the gaseous accretion disk was formed around the core, the planetary nebula was still in formation, since the high temperatures of the core must have ionized the surrounding gas, at least for a few thousand years.  I understand that the gas that is expelled from the interior of a dying star in its red giant phase does so at several kilometers per second. My question is: why the gaseous accretion disk that formed around the core was not immediately ejected into space as was the case with the gas from the nascent planetary nebula? Why was it gravitationally tied to the core while the surrounding gas was escaping from gravity? "
4174,Which are stars and which are noise in this comet photo?,"The Forbes news article NASA's Hubble Telescope Snaps Best Images Yet Of Our First Interstellar Comet shows the image below (which I have since annotated) of comet 2I/Borisov (C/2019 Q4) and links to this series of Hubble images: [website]Looking through the previews of those images, they all seem to have streaks of similar length and direction, so I am assuming that the telescope is tracking the comet's motion in each exposure and the streaks are stars, suggesting that all the small dots are noise and not stars.   Is that right? Is the fuzzy one an extended object? What causes so many isolated pixels to be so much brighter than the background? Is this just the tail of a statistical distribution of shot noise, or are there other mechanisms that can produce single pixel noise many standard deviations above  the statistical shot noise distribution?    "
4175,Calculating historical star maps from proper motion,"I'm working on some software which needs to calculate the position of stars and galaxies visible to the naked eye at different periods of human history.  The Yale Bright Star Catalogue gives the position and proper motion of visible stars.  Is calculating the historic positions simply a matter of multiplying each stars proper motion by the number of years between the date in question and the epoch, then subtracting the result from the position?  If so how far back in history could one go with this method and still produce a map that resembles what a human would observe with the naked eye? Would this method alone be sufficient to go back as far as 5000 years or are the other factors in play here that would need to be accounted for to make this accurate?  My criteria for ""accurate"" here is that a human observer wouldn't see a noticeable difference between the map and the night sky with the naked eye. Smaller inaccuracies are tolerable. "
4176,Meteorites bring water,"The latest information suggests that Earth's water came from Meteorites . The Moon was also bombarded by Meteorites and yet it has no water. Is this because it lacks an atmosphere and its water was lost in space ?  On further thought on this matter, it occurred to me that Mars has an atmosphere and yet it has no oceans either, just like the Moon . So Mars I assume was bombarded by meteorites, just like the Earth was and it has a stronger gravity than the Moon, yet it doesn't have oceans either ? So what happened ? "
4177,How do astronomers choose their research topic?,"Astronomers don't face much of an ordinary jobs market in their ""trade"". What does the process look like from choosing a topic for the PhD to doing research in a specific topic?  Let's say that you're very interested in exoplanets, would you as a new PhD on the topic be offered and accept a position in a project which does galaxies instead? And could you choose weather to do the physical theory or the observations or coding simulations? Can you pick and choose? "
4178,Are there equations to simulate creation of a solar system?,"I've been wanting to create a simulator to run tests based on properties of a star to find patterns in how planets form. Are there any already made equations for any of these countless relationships? Here are a few examples to further explain what sort of information I am looking for.  For example, how does the mass of a star relate to the distance of the frost line, and is there an already existing equation to estimate this?  More general example; If I wanted to find out how to estimate, say, a planets surface temperature based on a stars temperature and distance, what is the best way to do this?  Another example; To find the most likely average mass of a potential planet, what information would I need? Distance to star? Stars mass? Distance to nearest planets?  Another; How would I go about finding likely measurements of compositions of any hypothetical planets (surface/atmosphere/etc)  Absolutely any information is very welcome. I do not require any form of proven or precise measurements. If there is no equations, then all I need is what factors are involved in specific attribute development.  I'd like to emphasize my understanding that this is an extremely complex subject to go into detail. All I am asking for is any information or recommendations.  Here is a related question to my dilemma, in addition to this information, I am looking for more. Absolutely anything that may help, probably will. I am attempting to make as highly detailed of a model as possible. "
