0,What is a safe juice or liquid fast?,"For Lent I am doing a juice/liquid fast from sun up, to sun down. I can eat one meal at sun set, and snack before bed.  The thing is I was told I could “brake” my metabolism so that after my fast I would never lose lbs. Is this true? I know, “ask your doctor”, but I can’t afford one.  I know lots of other people that have done this kind of thing, and they all say to take in the calories I need and I’ll be fine. So what a safe way to do this? Should I stop my normal exorcize and Zumba until after the fast? Or should I just go about my life?  "
1,How can you determine each running heart rate zone using data from your runs or from specifically designed workouts?,"What workouts can you do to determine each threshold between your heart rate zones?  For example a lactate threshold pace can be determined by running as fast as possible for 30 minutes at a even pace.  Is there something similar for each heart rate threshold and what is it? Right now Im using 90 minute runs to determine any heart rate as being aerobic versus anaerobic, but I dont know how accurate this is nor feel that it is a very good measure. Really need something like this for knowing the threshold between aerobic and fat burning (or easy) zones. "
2,Is juice as healthy as the veggies it comes from?,"My little girl hates eating veggies, but loves the juice (like 100% carrot juice, “Superfood”, or V8). She is only 9, and I was the same way until I was around 20. So is there anything wrong with letting her have the juice rather than fight with about eating them? I still put them on her plate, and I still remind her that it’s the same stuff (this may be why she told me the juice was the same so it must be ok. Lol). So is the juice the same?   (Note that I am not asking about my parenting, I am asking about the juice being healthy for her.)  Thank you "
3,Is walking a warm up?,1) Is walking a warm up before brisk walking? if not what warm up exercise we should do?  2) Is walking a warm up before jogging? if not then what warm up exercise we should do? 
4,Lifting Iron (strength training) vs pushups ( knuckle)+ body weight squats+situps,Assuming your aim is to get better at martial arts not bodybuilding (hence strength training: lets take Rippetoe's 3x5). Which would improve performance? Also can they be done side by side? because I know that after lifting heavy you have to wait a day and train on alternate days. 
5,Is there any way or need to empty your bowels before excercise?,"I try to not take large meals for at least 12 hours before starting, yet abdominal exercises still can make me feel unwell and go to bathroom.  Is it normal? Or should I reconsider my diet? Does anyone else have this problem? "
6,How long does it take for muscles to recover?,"I lift weights to get stronger and to look better, I wonder how long does it take for muscle to recover after workout. I do typical workout routine for every muscle group, I work out every muscle group two times a week, would it be beneficial to do 3 times a week for every muscle group or even more? I can work out hard almost everyday and never get muscle soreness, pain whatever.  Does recovery time differs a lot for advanced lifter and beginner? Is it possible that all my muscle groups can recover as fast as 12 hours after workout?  Thank you in advance for the information you can provide me "
7,How do you motivate yourself to keep exercising?,"I'm always trying to find different ways to exercise (currently playing lots of Wii - that counts, right?) but I find the problem of after a few weeks to a month I lose motivation, get distracted and move on to something else.   Does anyone have any tips or idea on how to keep motivated? "
8,Working out when tired,How do you get yourself out of the trap wherein you start using tiredness as a reason (not an excuse) to skip your workouts ?  I do feel great after a workout and usually use this as motivation but is it right to be pushing yourself when you're genuinely tired ? 
9,Training the legs and Muscle growth,I've heard a lot of people saying that you can help muscle growth of all your body by training your leg.  First of all why ? I know it's because the leg muscle are the biggest muscle in the body but what's the link ?  And second question : Should I train my leg in every training to gain muscle or once a week is enough to give the boost for muscle growth ?  Thanks 
10,"Is the book ""Wheat Belly"" credible?","So I was given the book Wheat Belly last night which claims that much of the US's obesity is caused by eating wheat - specifically the highly-hybridized wheat we grow these days.   Does anybody know of any studies relevant to these claims? Does anybody have any personal experience relevant to these claims?   Edit: Dr Tim Noakes, of Lore of Running fame, appears to partially agree. "
11,I want to get ripped but don't know where to start. HELP!,"I'm a smalls scrony 18 year old, and I want to get ripped! I have no self confidence issues, I just hate people taking advantage of me beacuse I'm a smaller build! I'm never hungry but I eat enough to maintain my weight. I'm about 5'6"" and weigh 125 lbs. I have know idea where to start gaining weight and turning it to muscle. I don't play sports so my endurance is not great either. I'd like to know how to build that as well. Help with daily diet and a 7 day work out plan that I can slowly increase difficulty would be nice too! A specific question i have is: How many calories should I be eating everyday for weight gain? And does it matter if it's junk food? I heard that if your gaining weight it doesn't really matter, idk if that's true or not  Body: Ht- 5""6' Wt- 125 lbs. Age- 18  Need help with: Diet/how many calories daily do I need Muscle building workout plan And endurance training workout plan  I am hoping to workout daily "
12,Are situps actually harmful?,"I have seen several references to situps being harmful due to ""high compressive lumbar load"" and recommending crunches. When researching where the quote came from, it looks like every reference quotes the same paper by a Dr. Stuart M. McGill named Stability: from biomechanical concept to chiropractic practice. The author being a chiropractor pricked my ears since this is a profession which had sponsored beliefs ranging from ""vertical subluxations"" that can harm everything from backs to your brain to your liver to your chi (and, in the lab, any given pair of chiropractors will identify completely different ""vertical subluxations"" for the same patient). I don't know if Dr. McGill has a degree in any form of science-based medicine — his various biography pages are coy as to what he has other than a ""PhD"" — but I'm willing to give him the benefit of the doubt.  That said, has there been an supporting or opposing research on his claims? Is there any proof other than a 1999 paper? "
13,What is the most effective plan to get abs?,"Studies:   Show the ""bicycle"" was the most effective exercise. Shorter weighted ab exercises are greater than longer repetitive ab workouts.   Need to know:    Is it helpful that a certain percent of food consumption that should be protein? What is the most effective plan to get abs?  "
14,Can you do circuit training every day?,Is circuit training most beneficial if you do it everyday?   Should you take days off or alternate with something else to get better results? 
15,How can I calculate calories burned during an activity?,"I've found various online ""calculators"" for looking up how many calories are burned when doing an exercise like using an Elliptical machine.  Is there a way to calculate how many calories I burned during an activity with some reliability?   Does it matter if I train in intervals? "
16,Is there a rule of thumb for setting running goals?,"I'm pretty new to running and can only run for 2-3 minutes at a time. Is there any rule of thumb I should know of for setting goals? For example, each week run two minutes more or something like that?   I find it really hard to know what I should do, and I think my current method of running till I'm really puffed probably isn't the best way. "
17,Chest workouts without pull-ups or bench-presses,What chest exercises are available for people who don't have access to a pull-up bar or a bench/barbell? Are there any specific exercises that stand out as extremely good? 
18,"Shoulder pain, around the cuff. Any help?","I have pain (not too bad) in the right shoulder.  Annoying pain.  I believe it could be rotator cuff related, and there is some soreness.  I have had a shoulder cuff injury there before but it cleared up.  This was years ago though and i've been fine since.  I have noticed the last6 months that after working out my upper half (shoulders and pecs) my right shoulder is a lot higher than the left.  It takes effort and time (about an hour) for them to level out again.  I am not sure why I let this go but there you go.  What does this indicate?  Also this is around the time I started squats.  Could it be squat related?  Nerves etc?  Oh and my right side has always been weaker than my left.  Thanks. "
19,Getting in shape after age 30+,"I was thinking to start working out to get a nice muscular body, but is it worth it considering I'm 32 years old already? Is it too late? "
20,Post running meal,"I wonder what you recommend as a post-running meal. I've read that you're supposed to eat something right after the training to prevent your body storing your next big meal's calories as fat.  I use to workout with weights and when I did I really needed a post-workout snack. Then I switched to running and found I don't feel the need of a post-training meal. Am I mistaking? Should I at least eat a banana, a shake or something else? I stay away from protein shakes as they have some nasty side-effect on me.  What do you recommend? "
21,Zyzz body without steroids,Can a shredded body like Zyzz had be attained without the use of steroids? Actually can you get shredded at all without steroids?    
22,Full body workouts and rest periods,"I've recently gone from working out at home to working out at the gym. I weigh about 145lbs and I'm 6ft, so I'm aiming to pack on another 10-14lbs before the end of the year.  Currently I do a full body workout mixed with interval training for cardio, and I do this 3 times a week in the gym (Monday, Thursday, Saturday). I've recently read that I should be giving my muscles about 5-7 days rest time before working them again, so if this is true that would mean I would only be having 1 workout per week (plus cardio in another couple of gym sessions).  This strikes me as not being enough to meet my goal, is this correct?  Would you recommend moving to an isolated training regimen, where I focus on one muscle group in each session? I've always wondered how you can rest isolated muscle groups whilst working others, for example... if I work my arms on Monday, then Wednesday I would need to work my shoulders without hitting my arms, but I don't see how this is possible? "
23,The best protein intake to build muscles,"Protein is present in a lot of foods: Fruits, vegetables and plenty of other sources. First of all: Is it all the same? Or are there different types of protein? Second: Chicken for example contains protein (it belongs to category of foods) and banana contains protein (it belongs to fruits category), quaker contains protein (category unknown for me) and some vegetables contain protein too, also eggs.   Which food is better for our body to create muscles and why or is same?  Third question: Even in category of foods the protein differs, too. Chicken, red meat and foods like beans have different values for human body-muscles, as far as I've heard. Which option is better for foods?   Which of those types of protein is more helpful to build muscle? (Avoid healthy way, my ""exams"" was very good. I look care what I eat but I may increase some of those for better results that's why I am asking-of course I am not talking about anabolic or steroids. I hope you understand me about this ""healthy"" foods which are better.) "
24,Knees hurt after running a few days in a row. Injury possible?,"I don't have any pain if I walk for an hour or so. I walk to work every day (2 x 20 mins). I take long walks on weekends, but no knee pain after that. I started running. Small distances at first (2.5 - 3 km), then longer ones (5 - 6km). After third day of running long distance I felt pain in outer area of my knees. I wanted to know if this is temporary and if I should see a doctor because of this? Should I stop running or just shorten the distances I run and start lengthening them once my legs are more used to it? "
25,Excess fat around jawline and hips,"I'm quite fit, been going to the gym since August (stopped just into January and is about to start again) doing 60 forward leg swings and knee tucks (from hovering position), 30 reps on the ab wheel, 45 pull ups (front and back facing arms), 3 reps of plank for 1 minute, 45 seated chest pulls (50-60kg) and 45 shoulder presses.  I did the above 3-4 times a week, and started to go running (3-5 mile runs) on top of that because I didn't really notice a different to the amount of fat around my jawline, or any shrinking to the spare tire currently sitting around my hips.  I'm quite a slim guy, and lost a lot of fat at the gym and gaining mass. I'm roughly 5ft 11"" and weigh roughly 80kg (same as when I stopped going to the gym in December).  How can I lose the excess fat around my jawline (particularly under the chin) and around my hips?  Is this ab exercise I do enough to get rid of the spare tire, or should I be doing different things? "
26,Will calcium supplements affect my strength gain?,"I've just started taking calcium supplements, 1 tablet each day with each tablet containing 650mg of calcium.  This is to try and negate the effects soda can have on on making it hard for bones to absorb calcium. Also because I realize there was almost no calcium in my diet.  This is just as I have started exercising with dumbbells each day to try and gain more strength.   Will taking a supplement of something I was deficient in, in this case calcium, have any noticeable influence on my exercise results? Will I notice any effect that would be attributed to eliminating a deficiency suddenly? "
27,How to increase muscles for a pull-up,"I'm trying to get better at pull-ups. Currently I can do 3-4 unassisted* pull-ups, but would like to be able to steadily 3x10 pull-ups. What's the best way to achieve this?  I attend a gym which grants me access to the following:   Pull-up bar Rubber-bands for assisting in pulling up Assisted pull-up machine Lat pull-down I can also use the bar for reverse push-ups (supine row?) Potentially more...   Currently I just do unassisted pull-ups: 3 x 4-5. Would I be better using the assisted machine (where I can obviously do more) or using the rubber-bands to assist (where again, I can obviously do more), or should I avoid both and use the lat pull-down or supine row instead?  I read this question about assisted pull-ups about problems with the assisted pull-up machine, and truthfully had already heard it's a bad idea because it limits movement and one doesn't get a chance to use their balancing muscles.  I also read how to practice [sic] pull-ups without equipment and how to build up to a chin-up but this doesn't strictly apply because I can already do a pull-up, and I have access to equipment.  This question about increasing pull-up reps seems to focus exclusively on pull-ups with no attention to any other exercise involving back muscles.  The OP in this question seems like they're on a totally different level to me, as I want to work up to what they are already doing!  For completeness, this question about increasing pull-ups uses a machine I don't have access to (I go to the gym, I don't have a bar at home that I can practise on frequently. Also, I'm at work most of my day, and my colleagues probably won't appreciate me installing a bar and doing pull-ups while compiling code, but I'm open to the suggestion if it'll help).  *  Although I'm not 100% sure on my form: perhaps I'm not lowering myself enough  "
28,Are there exercises to help strengthen my little toe?,"No, I'm not looking to go into tiny barbells or anything like that. When I'm walking, particularly when I'm angling to a side, I find that I have a slightly tendency for the weight to go to the outside of my foot in the direction I'm angling towards. My little toe takes a fair amount of my weight. I get kind of a ""crunching"" feeling and a moment of pain before I reflexively shift my weight back again. For whatever reason, it very seldom happens when running, although it occasionally comes up in martial arts.  To the best of my knowledge, I've never broken or dislocated any toes, although not all of them are rotated completely upright, so I've occasionally speculated to my wife that I may have damaged them in the past and just not realized it (something which I'm given to understand is fairly common). Is there any sort of good exercise I can do to strengthen it up so that, when I incidentally put more weight on it, it doesn't hurt as much? My guess would be that this is something which has come up before, perhaps in dancing? "
29,Lifting heavier weights with my right arm,I have differently shaped shoulders through a disability so I purposely work my right arm with heavier dumbells.  What is the consequence of doing this to the left side of my body?  I mean is there corresponding muscles that could inadvertently be toning my left side whilst working my right? I think my lower back on my left has more definition. Could that be due to more strength training on my right arm?  Thank you 
30,Resting muscle groups within one session,"Earlier this week, I realized that I was only going to get this one workout this week. I usually do 3-4 per week.  I decided to do a full body program with some extra focus on legs, and got a squat rack.  I had a squat rack, in which I could do a lot of different stuff, like squats, overhead press, pullups, barbell rows. But I also wanted to do a lot of leg exercises afterwards. So I had a dilemma:   I wanted to keep the squat rack, since there is no guarantee that if I leave it, I'd get it back right away when I want it again I wanted to do other leg exercises (extensions, curls, calf raise), but I'd have to leave the rack   Question  Is there any measurable drawback to doing one big leg exercise, then doing upper body work for a while, and then doing legs again?  My first instinct is that I'd have to warm up again, which is easily done by doing some light sets, and increasing gradually. But besides that? "
31,Using packing peanuts to fill a punching bag?,"I recently bought an empty punching bag for, well punching, and I am trying to find a good source of filler. I have a plentiful source of free packing peanuts and was hoping these would work, but this might be too light. I realize the typical weight should be 70-100 lbs for a bag also, and this would be hard to achieve with packing peanuts.  Does anyone have cheap suggestions for boxing bag filler? Would packing peanuts work if I packed them densely enough? "
32,Importance of Rest Days,"Why are rest days important?  When the weather permits, I jog (or otherwise work-out) every day, but people often tell me I should not, because rest days are important. What is the rationale behind this? "
33,"Question about calories, protein and energy?","If calories are a measure of energy, and protein contains more calories per gram than carbohydrates then how does Atkins work? What is the difference between the energy provided by the 'carbs' and the 'calorie' energy that is in all food? Why does eating no carbohydrates make your body go into 'fat burning' mode for energy if everything contains calories?  "
34,What is the difference between 'Burning Fat' and 'Burning Calories'?,"What is the difference between 'Burning Fat' and 'Burning Calories'?  I feel I am over-weighted. To reduce my weight, how to know whether I need to burn calories or fat? "
35,Sore glutes from running,"General question: why would the upper glute area (piriformis, gluteus minimus, gluteus medius) get disproportionately tight and sore from running?  For me, the tightness and soreness in this specific region seems out of proportion to other areas of my body. Nothing else gets this sore or tight.   This area gets sore enough that it is the limiting factor in my recovery from longer runs. Following a long run, typically the rest of my body is ready to go again on schedule, while this area has yet to recover completely.  Info specific to me: I am not currently doing weight training, but I think my strength is fairly balanced across all the muscle groups involved in running. My glutes have genetic capacity to be one of my stronger body parts; this area has never been my weak area.  I am interested in improving my running technique, training methods, mobility or whatever else is required so that I do not over-stress these muscles.   If more info is needed, please leave a comment and I'll update the question.  UPDATE:   I have no numbness.  My soreness is normal delayed onset muscle soreness. I would not say I have pain other than DOMS.  I have no symptoms of nerve compression.  I do have tightness immediately after running.   Response to Mike-DHSc  I think you are generally on the right track. I sit a lot, and my sitting posture is not great. I would not be surprised if my hip abductors are lengthened. My hip flexors are shorted, and I have been working on that through Dr. Kelly Starrett's mobility program for a few months (and getting good results). But I have not been addressing lengthened hip abductors. What do you recommend (given that I'm already doing all the stretches you recommended)?   Final Update I implemented some hip abductor strengthening exercises and continued the mobility work and the issue has almost entirely gone away. "
36,Can I still drink and train to run a marathon?,"I'm in my 30's, new to running and training to run my first marathon. Currently I'm at the 15-20 miles/week mark and looking forward to running my first half in November and my first marathon in December.   I still like to drink wine &amp; occasionally drink a few bottles in a night that hasn't necessarily affected my training schedule progress so far but I fear that it may in the future.   Should I quit drinking for the rest of my training? Is it okay to have a couple glasses of wine 3-4 days/week without substantially hindering my progress or limiting my performance or is it okay as long as I'm staying hydrated and eating appropriately, sleeping well, etc.? "
37,Mom Losing Her Mobility Because of her Weight Gain,"My mom has gained so much weight over the last few years that she's having a really hard time getting around. She's a really great mom, so I don't want to make it sound like she's not as good of a mom just because of the weight. But Because of her weight right now my sister has to do more and more things for her.   My mom is 44 years old, 5'4"" and more than 550 pounds at this point. She started to gain weight about 10 years ago (she used to be 165lbs) when my dad died in a really terrible car accident. She was already getting pretty big (375-400lbs?) when I left for college 3 years ago, but I feel like her weight has gotten so out of control since then. Left alone with my little sister, my gorgeous mom is heavier and heavier and heavier every time I come home.  When I'm home I see all this crap that she is busy eating, and she claims that its just because I'm back. Before I left she used to eat a lot, but now its just crazy. This last time I was home my sister hinted that she actually ""tones it down"" for when I'm around ""because I give her such a hard time about her weight."" I can't imagine the crap she's ingesting while I'm away!!!   The thing is that she's so big right now that she can't fit behind the wheel of the car, so my sister has to drive her everywhere. I tell my sister not to go pick up food for her all the time, and she mostly denies it, but I know that she's probably too embarrassed to tell the truth. My sister has to help her with countless ""other things"" around the house too, since my mom is having such a hard time standing, getting up, etc.  I've tried everything with her, but she has somehow found away to diffuse every suggestion I make. Ugh.  She can barely make it from one room to the other without getting super out of breath and needing to rest for a while before making it to the next one. She hasn't been up the stairs in who knows how long. She's not disabled, just that between being out of shape and her weight being so high right now, she can't do most things. My sister is talking about trying to get her one of those mobility scooters so that she can get around despite the state she's in.  I know this is probably selfish of me, but I have such mixed feelings now about my college graduation at the end of the year. I know that part of the reason she hasn't come out to visit me yet is because it's getting harder to get her on a plane. She says she'll come out for my graduation--apparently planning on buying a row seats and renting a scooter to make it around campus--but I'm not entirely sure she will brave the embarrassment. And quite frankly, there is part of me (shallow, I know) that is scared of showing off an immobile 600lb mom in a scooter to all my friends on my big day. On the other hand, I'd be heartbroken if my mom never made it to my college graduation because simply she got too fat to come.  What can a girl in my position do? What should I do? What the heck is going on? Or am I being selfish here? How is it fair that she gets to eat like this, and we have to manage all with the consequences?     "
38,The chemical make-up of food: can non-fat be converted to fat?,"If someone eats more calories than they burn, then they will put on weight, as I understand.  Question 1:  But what if a person eats a lot of calories but zero fat? Or zero saturated fats and trans fats?  Would the person then put on weight or not?  That question is based on the idea - and I don't know if this is true or not - that people put on fat by eating too many calories because the body burns other stuff that it extracts from food before burning the fat from food.  So question 2:  Is it true that that is the reason the body accumulates fat - because the body uses other things as energy before using fat?  That first question is also based on the idea - and again, I don't know if this is true or not - that the body cannot convert something that is not fat, into fat. Something that is not fat cannot be changed into fat in the body.  Question 3:  Is it true that the body cannot convert something that is not fat into fat? Rather, the body simply accumulates fat while burning other things?  And question 4:  Would a diet consisting only of fruit, vegetables, nuts, seeds, honey, eggs, and fish be effective for a person to lose weight even if the person eats a lot of food - so long as they only eat those things? "
39,What is crossfit?,"I frequently hear the buzzword, ""crossfit"" from several of my coworkers.   What is crossfit?. Is it a type of workout or philosophy?   What does it loosely consist of? What are the goals of crossfit training?  A cheap google brings up a crossfit website and some type of gym or website. Further research shows a pretty high-level description of crossfit. "
40,What workout should I do if I want to prepare my condition?,"During weekends I'm doing a lot of sports, e.g. snowshoeing in the winter and biking and hiking during summer. I personally think, my condition is slightly above average, but the problem is, I now reached a point where I want to make tours that are beyond my condition limit. That means, the tours that are now getting interesting for me have too many kilometers and especially altitude difference. (To get a feeling: 1000m (climbing) while biking and maybe 2000m while walking is okay for me but not considerably more).  Now I have approximately 1 hour per workday of free time which I spent for work out, mostly running. I would like to use this hour a little bit more focused on strengthening my condition, but I'm not sure what to do. So are there any recommendations how I can use 1 hour per day to strengthen my condition especially for hiking and biking? Is running a good option? "
41,Throwing punches while running,"Why do people, particularity boxers, throw punches into the air while running? Is there a reason and is there a name for this? "
42,Is my current diet good for strength building?,"I'm looking to build strength. I'm not concerned with size or bigger muscles so much as strength.  At the moment I eat a lot of meat and carbs. For most meals I tend to eat things like donor kebabs, burgers, chicken, pizza, subway subs etc.  A lot might be considered junk food, although a lot is freshly made from decent restaurants.   From what I understand protein is what is important for strength building. Is a high meat diet good for this? Does it matter if the meat comes from junk food sources, e.g. a quarter pounder from McDonalds? "
43,How do you train for multiple aptitudes?,"I've seen this infograph that explains what load, reps, sets etc. you will need to do for each goal or aptitude:    But what would you do if your final goal was two of them? Say you wanted to get a lot of strength as well as endurance for example. How would you proceed?  Would you follow the graphs recommendations for one day or week on one goal and then the next week is for the other goal? Would you average out the variables? Would you spend several months on one and then the other?  What would you do? "
44,Does sweating interfere to the muscle/weight gain?,"Details  I do train by 5x5 program to gain muscle and weight, 3 times in the gym per week, keeping my training sessions short: 30 - 45 min, each workout I wear very warm: t-shirt, hoodie, underpants and short pants (and it's in boiling summer) so it's not surprising that I'm very sweating while the training.  When I'm wearing warm I feel that training being better in terms of a better stretch of muscle, feeling the power/ability to do more reps by keeping muscle warm.  Things that also should be considered:   I'm 23 years old weight: 66 kg / 145 lbs height: 185 cm / 72,8 inch during the training, I'm drinking the gainer   Questions  Does sweating interfere to the muscle/weight gain?  Can a workout of this kind somehow hurt the heart? "
45,Can meal frequency have a significant impact on exercise?,"I tend to eat one small meal/snack and one very large meal each day, as opposed to the typical breaskfast, lunch and dinner.  I always feel that I eat enough and my body seems well suited to this routine. Is this in anyway detrimental to exercise? Would I gain anything by switching to a  breakfast lunch and dinner routine?  I am mainly interested in strength building although I am interested if there can be an impact in general. "
46,Can psoas muscle cause lower back pain?,"Can tight psoas muscle cause lower (lumbar) back pain? If yes, which exercise would be best to recover? Thanks.  How do you differentiate if the pain in lower back is because of tight psoas or due to locked facet joint (No neurological problem)?   EXTRA (if it seems relevant to question): This pain also seems to sometime transfer to hip and tail bone, and as per the MRI and X-ray reports there's no disk or nerve pinching problem I've had ~10 MRIs and 10 X-rays and all show no problem in spine or joint. Though there's inflammation in hip (it was in SI joint as well, but now it is not). It seems to me now that it is probably a muscle related problem.  "
47,Exercise that loads hamstring whilst reaching its peak ROM?,"I've recently realised that I have very tight hamstrings - when lying flat on the ground, I can only lift each leg around 75 degrees off the floor when doing this:    Though I'm keeping my legs straight, maybe I should bend them slightly?  My goal is to get past 90 degrees, but I don't want to compromise strength or explosive power, particularly for jumps and sprints. Given this, my reading says to do an exercise that reaches peak extension of the hamstring whilst subjecting the muscle to a substantial force.  I'm home-gymming with a very basic setup at the moment, so the less equipment required, the better. What exercise(s) should I do? I've tried the exercise shown above with rubber cords and some gradual movement, though my arms don't provide enough resistive force for my hamstrings. "
48,How does muscle size relate to strength?,"I've heard it often that the size of muscles, for example biceps, is not related to how strong someone is. Is this true?  See for example this image of Gu Yanli who won the strongest man championship twice:    While a muscular guy, doesn't seem to compare in size to say, Ronnie Coleman, body building champion:    I have asked other questions about building strength while not getting too big physically with an answer saying it is possible. So, what is the link between muscle size and strength? "
49,What should I be concerened about healthwise with a fast metabolism?,"I seem to have a very fast metabolism, ever since I was a teenager.  For instance I easily consume 500 calories from non-diet sugar based soda a day and then may typically consumer anywhere from 1500 to 2500 calories based on the food I eat, a lot of which is junk food or per-prepared.  I tend to get very little exercise aside from walking where I need to go. This has been the case for years.  I'm not overweight at all, if anything I am slightly underweight as I am just over 6 feet tall and 175 pounds.  I seem to have a decent stamina being able to keep up with most people  in say a random running race or similar spontaneous physical activity. I don't feel tired or anything similar.  If my body is burning off all these calories with no exercise, is this a good thing? What other health effects should I worry about? "
50,Food to take in before jogging,"I basically jog for 30 minutes just after work at about 9:00 pm, before dinner. I sometimes have a full lunch at about 3:00 pm, but most of the time I have some fruit because I reach the office at about 12:00 pm, having had morning breakfast at 10:00 am.  1) Is it safe to jog if I am feeling my stomach is empty? (sometimes to maintain the routine, I have to go there directly) I'd just be drinking half a glass of water.  2) If I am feeling my stomach is empty, is it OK to take 3 bananas as they provide instant energy?  3) Or it is mandatory to eat some light snack and before going for a jog? "
51,More hours in the gym,"Does spending more hours in the gym makes you getting bulkier and reach the body you after faster? I know that rest is needed to get bulkier but if I exercise the same muscle over and over in the same day, does that make it getting bigger faster?  I have seen a report about a big transformation for a fat guy in 6 months, as he was spending long hours in gym  [website]"
52,Advice on gaining weight,"   Possible Duplicate:   I am underweight. How do I gain weight and muscle?       Here's some info about me:   I'm 21 years old.  Weight: 50kg (110 pounds) Height: 1.70m (5'7"")   What would you suggest I do to gain weight?  I've heard about Creatine and doing exercises, but I need some advice: what should I eat, or what routine should I follow when doing exercises? "
53,Is it bad to sit down immediately after the exercise?,"I've heard numerous times that you should not sit down immediately after the exercise when the heart rate is high and you should stand and walk around for a bit. However I don't remember a convincing explanation as to why this is the case.  Is this true or an urban myth based on some dated research? If true, what exactly happens in a human body that makes it bad? "
54,Exercise watches that can monitor irregular heart beats,Are there any exercise watches such as Apple Watch and fitbit watch that can monitor irregular heart beat? My heart beats irregularly for each hours approximately. I also plan to wear this watch to run. Is there any suggestion? Thank you very much! 
55,"How much exercise is ""just enough""?","I'm in my early 40s, BMI=27, and my primary goal in exercising is to be healthy:  to live as long and as ably/comfortably as I can. My secondary goals are to maintain a reasonably good weight (preferably BMI &lt; 25) and physique, and to elevate my mood.  The problem is that I am finding that my workouts have a significant drain on my energy afterward, such that I get much less done in the hours following a workout, and I generally feel achy and slightly unwell. Some of that may be due to factors within my control: meal and hydration timing, good nutrition, good sleep, etc. I'm not perfect on any of these.  But I think that most of the after-effect is simply due to being tired from the workout. What I've considered is that maybe I am overdoing it.   I know the more fit I am, the less this happens (and I posted a similar question abou tthat long ago), but even feeling relatively fit (resting heart rate often under 60), these workouts often really knock me out.  Part of this was inspired by leafing through a book about 80/20 running, and how for improvements in running performance, one should do 4 moderate runs for every 1 hard run.   The question is:  How much exercise should I do to fulfill my health goals while minimizing the after-workout brownout?  To give you an idea of my intensity, to see if it is maybe too much, my current workout is this (almost all inclined treadmill), three times a week on Sun, Tue, Thu:  Walk to Gym (1.6 miles) carrying gear (10 lbs), 15 min mile pace.  Inclined treadmill (not holding onto the bar other than 1 min rests), ~55 minutes:   15% grade @ 4.1 mph for up to 22 minutes. (This is pretty fierce, at least for me. When I started, 4 min was my maximum time for it). 15% grade @ 4.1 mph for up to 1 minute, holding onto bar.  15% grade @ 3.5 mph for 5 min 15% grade @ 5.1 mph for 2 to 2.5 min (heart rate gets to 170+ for this!) 15% grade @ 2.0 mph for 2-3 min, holding on as a cool-down 15% grade @ 3.6 mph for 15 min   Flat treadmill (5 min)   5 min run, alternating between 8 min mile and 6:58 min mile.   Preacher bench/machine bicep curls (5-10 min):   35 x 15 40 x 15 45 x 15 50 x 15   Walk back from Gym (1.6 miles) carrying gear (10 lbs), 15 min mile pace.  I have also done other weight lifting but lately I am a little more pressed for time and am just limiting it to arms for now. Lame, I know, but really my focus is cardio and general systemic fitness.  What do you think?  Am I overdoing it for my goals?  Or should I just accept that three days a week I'm going to feel like the air has been let out of my tires? "
56,"Do Sauna belts really help in losing belly, hips, and buttocks fat?","Do Sauna belts really help in losing belly, hips, and buttocks fat? How effective are they? Are there any side effects associated in using it? "
57,Is it possible for an adult to significantly improve passive static flexibility?,"I've heard that improving passive static flexibility is only possible for children, but for adults it's more or less set in stone, because it's not possible to lengthen the ligaments as you age.  So by this logic it's hopeless for an adult with average and below-average flexibility to try to do a split.  Are there any studies that would confirm or deny these claims? If it's not true, what kind of exercises can improve passive static flexibility in adults? "
58,How can I keep my shoulders and wrists from dislocating when doing yoga?,"I'm double-jointed in a lot of places, one of which is my shoulders. Every time I raise my arms straight over my head my shoulders dislocate. It's not really painful, just uncomfortable. It also makes doing yoga poses like Warrior 1 and Chair Pose difficult. Is there a way to keep this from happening, or a way to modify the pose so it doesn't happen?  Along the same lines, whenever I do Side Plank I'm placing a lot of weight on my wrists. They are also double-jointed, and it actually is quite painful to place weight on them. How can I modify this pose to alleviate the pain? "
59,Can someone who takes steroids get muscle mass even without lifting?,"My impression given what I read on the internet about it was that steroids help your body recover much faster after workout. So for the recovering to work, you still have to damage your body in the gym, right? But I heard people saying that you don't even have to work out to get the muscles if you're on roids. Is there any truth in that? "
60,Should you run with a cold?,I am six weeks away form my first marathon and the last two and half weeks of training have been badly affected as i have been suffering with a bad winter cold.   I am still coughing fairly regularly and don't feel fully over it but am starting to get concerned that my fitness level is going to start spiraling downwards if I don't start getting back out and racking up the miles. My last long run of 19.5 miles was over two weeks ago now and I've only managed a couple of easy 4-6 miles since.     Should I just continue resting until I feel fully recovered and accept that I probably won't achieve my sub 4 hour goal or can I start to get my training schedule back on track as I recover?   Would running actually    help me clear my chest and help    recovery or could I end up causing    more problems for myself?  
61,At what point do I start to burn muscle on a calorie deficit diet?,"If I'm on a calorie deficit and trying to burn fat, at what point do I start burning muscle instead of fat?  How can I be sure that I'm eating enough to minimize muscle loss, but remain on a calorie deficit so that I can burn fat? "
62,Can old running shoes be used as walking shoes?,"Once I've made the decision to get new running, is it okay to use my old running shoes as walking shoes (to and from the workplace / around the neighbourhood) or is the only appropriate place for old running shoes the donation bin or the trash?  I guess this slightly depends on wear as well. When would be the ideal time so you could get the maximum amount of usage? "
63,How to improve mobility of shoulders where arms straight together behind back?,"I attended one beginner course in CFT Lauttasaari where they said that this is a common problem with guys and recommended stick/bar training to improve flexibility and range of motion. This is necessary for safe training for technical manoeuvres such as clean and jerk. I want to hear your opinion about this, I think inflexibility can be a serious flaw and all power training should be done so that it does not get worse. My goals are to get such flexibility that I can safely train basic weight-lifting movements and play tennis without compromising power (and still having the range of motion). I made a little video showing how bad the inflexibility is here.  Which muscles and which movements do I need to address the inflexibility problem with hands straight behind back?    Perhaps Related        Arm cross stretching behind the back, how to improve it?     "
64,How can I tell the difference between good carbs and bad carbs?,"How do you determine if something is good carb or bad carb?  Reason I ask is after a month of hardcore working out I realized my body has changed.  While I was eating five meals a day with very low carbohydrate I find myself now in need of six - seven meals daily else I feel dizzy.  I am ALOT leaner compare to pre-workout condition.  I was told to intake more carbohydrate but I don't want to over do it.  So, what's the best way to determine if food is good carb or bad carb?  I guess i should word it better.  Ok let's say if i were to go into a grocery store today and shop for ""good carb"" food what would i be looking for and what's the most obvious way to look for them? Besides simply reading the label, which fresh produce usually don't have. "
65,What kind of cardio exercises can be performed without a gym or fitness equipment?,"For a healthy heart, I've got myself into a habit of stopping by the gym after work and using the fitness equipment (treadmill, stair machine, etc.) or using the stationary bike I have at home.  However, I'll have a vacation in the future where I'll be in a foreign city for a few weeks.  I won't have access to a gym or fitness equipment.  I can take a pair of running shoes, but I don't think I'd like to run in a foreign city, and I'm not much of a runner.  So, aside from running, what other kinds of cardio exercise could I do while on vacation, say, from the comfort of a hotel room?  I know sit-ups are easy but could those be considered a cardio exercise? "
66,Drinking cold vs hot water,"Since I started my new job about 1,5months ago, I've been conveniently located near the water cooler. This means, that I get plenty of water. Waaay more than 8 glasses per day. And now here's my question:  Should I be drinking hot or cold water?  Kris Gethin suggested drinking cold water, since that makes your body spend more energy on heating the water up, thus creating a bit more of a calorie deficiency while dieting.  On the other hand, I've read a couple of articles online, that suggest, that drinking hot water somehow helps purify the body, and helps one to stay awake.   Which of these should I drink and why? "
67,How do I lose body fat without losing body weight?,"Right now, I'm currently doing light exercises every other day, and I am following the Paleo Diet.  By light exercises, I mean :   10 pushups 15 squats 15 arm lifts Repeat for 3 sets   In the months that I have practiced this, I have seen the overall difference. However, right now, I think I've plateaued.   What should I do to maintain my overall weight, while losing body fat?  I believe my current weight (around 67kg?) is optimal already for my height (5'10""), so I'm pushing to maintain it while reducing my body fat. "
68,Breathing while exercising in cold weather,"I've been told when doing cardio to breath in through the nose and out through the mouth.  Where I live though, the air is cold enough 3-4 months of the year so that deep breathing through my nose stings my nasal passages.    Is this healthy?  Should I change up my breathing pattern, or will the stinging go away? "
69,What is the least damaging way to eat unhealthy food?,"I've been on a reduced calories diet for past 4 months and lost about 20kg, but I keep on getting sweet tooth.  The main unhealthy thing that I eat is mostly 85% chocolate, which I usually eat after excercising. By eat I mean I take couple of bites, not eat the whole thing :)  Is it better to eat something like this more less regularly, or just try to stick with the diet for as long as I can and then eat a lot of it? By that I mean letting myself off the diet for a day or something like that. What do you recommend?  And when I'm about to eat some chocolate, should I do so before or after some excercise? In the morning, afternoon, or it doesn't matter? "
70,Exercise frequency,"Is doing 10 times 10 pull-ups during ~1 hour 5-6 time a week too often?  Is it good for keeping current muscle level, combined with the right diet? Is it necessary to add weight to grow muscles? What will decreasing frequency and increasing the amount per exercise change? "
71,"My trainer insists on stretching before any exercise, even warming up. Should I be worried?","He wants to start out by doing rather strenuous, even slightly painful, static stretches, mostly in the legs, followed by 10-20 minutes of cardio and then the rest of the workout is mostly lifting. We had a bit of an argument about this. He claims that warming up first is more likely to cause cramps. Everything I have read seems to contradict this. Is he wrong?  I don't know what to make of our differing opinions. This is his profession, it seems disrespectful to doubt his experience and training. He is obviously a skilled athlete himself. I don't want to be like an anti-vaxxer mom ignoring a doctor because she did some googling. But what if he just doesn't do his research properly and doesn't keep up to date on the science? What if he just blindly follows the advice of his mentors from years ago or relies on his own anecdotal evidence? "
72,Refuelling during a run?,I've reached a point where my training runs are long enough (2 - 3 hours) and far enough (15+ miles) that I  need to take on board some additional energy in the form of gels and/or sports drinks in order to complete them. Is there any documented or recognised rate or consumption or guidelines as to how this should ideally be done in order to get the maximum benefits? Should they be taken at regular intervals throughout the run or delayed towards the second half of the run? I appreciate this will vary depending on effort and fitness; I am currently using a couple of gels and a bottle of sports drink to get me through a 19.5 mile three and a quarter hour run although the last 3 or 4 miles are still a real struggle. 
73,What is a reasonable schedule for increasing flexibility?,"I have terrible general flexibility, which both causes discomfort and affects my form when exercising (for example, I fall off balance any time I try and do a squat). This is something that I'd very much like to change, but in the past I've never been able to make a dent in it, so I'd like to try and be a bit more objective and scientific in my approach this time.  My question is, essentially - what is a reasonable schedule to gain flexibility for a given motion? I want to know this so that I can adjust my stretching to see what is and isn't working, and I want to give the stretching enough time to show noticeable improvements.  As a general guidance, I'm looking to know, essentially, whether my gains will be mostly front-loaded or should they be consistent throughout the improvement phase, and roughly (order of magnitude), how long should it take to go from poor flexibility (e.g. I'm about 20-25cm away from being able to touch my toes) to normal flexibility (e.g. touching my toes). One month? Three months? A year?  Edit: Doing a bit of reading, I think I should probably clarify that from what I can tell, I'd like to improve static-passive flexibility. It seems likely that I'll be able to consistently do static stretches, though I'm going to try my best to do PNF stretches. "
74,Muscle helping Arm lowering,"What muscle are worked if I lower my arm? It can't be the deltoid, as front and lateral raise use deltiod. But lets say I am upside down and lower my arm, which muscle I will work out? Just like triceps are opposite to bicep, what is opposite to deltoid? "
75,Shoulder pain after training - How to continue?,"I started weight lifting training again after a pause of 5 years. I started really slowly, always did a good warm up (10 min cardio + first sets with reduced weight). After two months of training I now had shoulder pain after the push day (bench press, dips). It gets better after two days.  I did some research and found out that I probably have to train my shoulder rotators separately.  Now my questions:    Should I completely pause my training for some time? Or could I do exercises that do not stress the shoulders that much like pull-ups (if the pain is gone of course). Should I start the rotator training immediately with very light weights? Or should I wait until the pain is completely gone?  "
76,How bad is high fructose corn syrup relative to the alternatives?,"We all know that sugar intake should be limited in general, but people seem to look on high fructose corn syrup especially poorly. Why is it any worse than sucrose? Crystalline fructose? Other sweeteners such as stevia or aspartame? "
77,How does a muscle grow step-by-step?,"I am trying to understand how a muscle such as the bicep grows step-by-step. For example (but not limited to):   How nutrients line up? Which are essentials? What exactly do they do?   It's hard to make sense of the process when potein, bcaas, glutamine, amino acids, complexe carbs, simple carbs, con-cret creatine, mono creatine, calories, weight gainer, pre, intra, post workout supplements all seem to promote lean muscle.  I'm looking for a physiological answer. "
78,How many calories to burn daily to see a change in weight within a month,"My BMI is 26.8, which means that I am in the overweight category.   When one hits a gym regularly every day, what is the minimum amount of calories that he should burn in order to see a change in his weight over a month's time? I generally focus on simple exercises like being on the treadmill for around 20mins (150 Cal) and on the cross trainer for 20mins as well.   Is this enough or should I increase my workout?  "
79,Is egg white powder a good alternative to whey protein?,"I've been having a hard time increasing my protein intake. I live in a university dormitory where we are not allowed to cook. Cafeterias don't offer a lot of healthy options either (I'm from the Philippines, by the way, and Filipino food is usually loaded with grease). On the other hand, I am also lactose intolerant, has GERD and possibly IBS. I have tried various brands of whey protein before, including those with whey protein isolate as main ingredient but I tend to become bloated after taking them. One thing that doesn't upset my stomach are eggs. Then I learned that there is such a thing as egg white powder (the kind used in baking) and it's pretty cheap. A kilo (~2.2lbs) costs only PhP1000 (~US$22), more than half the price of most whey protein sold here.  My questions are as follows:   Is it a good idea to make shakes using egg white powder? I can imagine that adding water will reconstitute it into its original, slimy form. Will it cause stomach troubles? I've never tried raw eggs before. What is the difference between the egg white powder used in baking and egg protein powder? Is it safe to store egg white powder without refrigeration?  "
80,Weight loss does not seem to follow my calculations,"I have been tracking my calorie intake and expenditure for 18 months. I am maintaining my weight and getting stronger, which I assume means increased muscle and less fat. However my fat loss (by visual inspection) does not appear to be anywhere close to my predictions. IE I should have lost far more fat than I have seen.  I have assumed:   Body fat is 7500 calories per kilo. Machines give an accurate estimate of calories burnt. Food gives an accurate count of calories contained stated on the packet. I have not included Basal Rate of Metabolism, it is effectively zero in my model.   And yet I am losing far less fat that I should be. Is there something I am missing? How can my predictions be so badly wrong? "
81,Getting stressed for going to gym,"I have been going to both Gym and Crossfit alternate days for the past 3-4 months regularly. Lately, I have started feeling stressed about going to the Gym. I feel I am missing rest after coming from work and getting ready to go to the gym\workout is seeming like a regular activity and stressing me. Is this a normal thing people undergo? Is there a good way to deal with this? "
82,"When should I drink protein powder, in the morning or at night, before meal or after meal?","How can  I maximize its utility? When should I drink protein powder, in the morning or at night, before meal or after meal? "
83,Pullup Bar & Bodyweight exercises,"First of all my excuses if this question seems stupid.  I'm 19 years old and have a friend who is the same age as I do. He has been going to the gym for about 1,5 year, where he is mainly lifting weights, bench press, squats etc. I on the other hand have been exercising from a young age mainly with bodyweight exercises and started gym some months ago.  I'm around 5ft10, ~60kg. My friend is a little shorter and a little heavier. When I do bench press I use almost 3-times less weight. Same story with the smith machine. However, my friend, who lifts so much more weight than I do, can do only manage one complete pull up(from full hand extension to chin at the top of the bar) and 3 chin ups.  I on the contrary do around 20 pullups and 25 chinups and started doing pullups with a 20kg weight belt(manage around 5 full repetitions). Due to not having enough spare time I nearly abstain from the machines and make my workout program on the pull up bar (pull ups, chin ups, typewriters, toes on top, leg curls, muscle up dips etc).  My questions are:  Is my friend, who lifts 3 times more weight than I do, stronger?  If he manages to lift so much weight, why he only manages so few repetitions?  Why can't I lift as much weight if I can lift, without any problem my own 60kg weight plus 20kg more?  Thank you for your time! "
84,What's wrong with losing more than 6 pounds per week?,"I'm a 24 year old male, 154 pounds. My goal is to lose 12 pounds. It's my first weight-losing experience, I've never read anything about it, so feel free to explain the basics.  The reason for my question is that, psychologically, it's much simpler for me to maintain an extreme diet for a fortnight, rather than a moderate diet for months. But such pace is not recommended in MyFitnessPal app.   What exactly is wrong with it?   Is it much harder to maintain a constant weight after extreme dieting, than after a moderate diet? Should I expect certain health issues because of such a diet?  "
85,Why does one lose weight even after stopping exercise for short time durations,"I started exercising regularly two months back. I used to go to gym 5-6 times a week and started with basic compound movements and cardio alternately.  I had an ankle injury two weeks back and was unable to go to gym. Not that I was bedridden but I just couldn't exercise. During this time, my diet more or less remained the same with respect to macro-nutrients. I went to gym today and measured my weight and surprisingly, I had lost ~1.4 kgs (from 66.4 to 65) over these two weeks. Can anyone explain why this happened? I am quite surprised myself. Is this related to muscle degeneration?  "
86,"What is a ""Runners High""?","There have been a few times in my life, where I believe I have experienced the phenomenon called ""Runners High"", or the euphoric state during a run where you feel like you can keep running for forever.    My question is two fold:     What exactly is this sensation?   Are there ways to 'train' your body to get into this state quicker?  "
87,Flexibility questions,"I want to get more flexible for BJJ. I'm intending on stretching 3 times (or more) a day, holding each stretch for about 30 seconds.  I've read that it's good to strengthen the muscles while you stretch them to avoid overstretching. I already have strong legs because I used to do both weighted and bodyweight squats. At the moment, the only exercise I do for my legs is 800m, 2k and 4k runs - is that going to be adequate strengthening?  And is three times a day excessive (/dangerous)? "
88,How to get enough Protein as a vegetarian?,"Is is possible to take on enough protein to build muscle whilst eating a vegetarian diet?  Many sources of proteins such as meat, poultry and fish are obviously ruled out.  Do you have experience of building muscle without meat? I'd be interested to know which foods you do consume. "
89,"Kettlercise, calories burnt","I never heard of Kettlercise before so looked at some videos. Kettlercise doesn't look very demanding.  Less heavy breathing than my 12 minute/mile pace jogs. There are very impressive claims about how much calories Kettlercise can burn, like 657 calories in 45 minutes (24yo F, 5'6"", of unknown weight) I tried using the calories burnt as function of HR formula* on this page:  Is it possible to measure calorie burn from heart rate alone?  That formula comes up with numbers I think are credible for my calorie burn when I am jogging (*I have a pretty good estimate of my real VO2MAX).  But the HR that would be required for a 24yo female to get to 657 cal/53 minutes, requires all kinds of extreme values in the formula above. VO2max = 50, 70 kg, avg HR = 195.  Do those numbers make sense(??)  Is the formula that inaccurate?  Or would I be right to think that Kettlercise energy expenditure is probably being over-hyped? "
90,How to mitigate damage from running on concrete,I am a novice and started running 6K. I am planning to step up to 12K. My concern is that I only have concrete surfaces to run on and my frequency is 5 times a week. Will that tax my joints? What would you suggest. How can I minimize injury? 
91,How does 200g of toast relate to 500g of weight loss?,"When I look at my 'calorie counter app' it says that two slices of Peanut Butter Toast (assuming 200g) are roughly 1427 kJ of energy.   Then when I look at this post - I see a rule     There are a couple of useful observations at this point. First, the “3500 calories per pound” rule of thumb is perfectly valid… as long as it is applied correctly.   So if we convert that to metric we get     32.3 kJ / kg   So very roughly - if I have a 32KJ deficit at the end of the day - that should correspond to a 1 Kg weight loss.   Now perhaps the answer is energy density, peanut butter toast has a high energy density per gram and stored body fat has a low energy density per gram. But something still seems fishy.   Is my mathematics completely incorrect? My question is: How does 200g of toast relate to 500g of weight loss?  "
92,Do I need to take creatine and L-glutamine on rest days to maintain a load?,"I use creatine and L-glutamine for my workouts, typically taking the L-glutamine about an hour before my workout, and creatine immediately after. (I don't take them together because I understand they compete for receptors, limiting absorption).   I also try to keep the load up by taking creatine first thing in the morning, and L-glutamine last thing before bed regardless of whether I worked out that day.  My question is: do I need to take these supplements on rest days in order to maintain my ""load""? Should I be taking two servings* of each on rest days instead of just one? Are the daily servings unnecessary?   *A serving for me is typically a heaping spoonful dissolved in water or cold tea (I know that a sugary drink would help absorption, but I'm not willing to take the downside of the sugar). "
93,I grew fat due to age-related changes. Will I gain muscle mass more easily now?,"I'm a 25 year old male and I added 20 pounds of fat in the last 3 months. My father had a similar experience at the same age, so I guess it's age-related.  Before my mid-20s, gaining muscle, actually any type of mass, was really hard for me, regardless of how much I ate or exercised. Now, I have the opposite situation, I can't lose weight. So, my idea is the following: instead of trying to lose weight, in my current situation, I should focus on gaining muscle mass.   So, how likely is it that I will gain muscle mass more easily now? Or is growing fatter not usually related to gaining muscle mass? "
94,How can power tracking tools such as MyoTest or Tendo Unit help my weight training?,"I'm investigating tools that can be used to analyze weight training performance. Let's say I'm doing a squat. Besides my gut feeling, how can I know how well I'm lifting? How much force am I applying? Am I balanced during the lift?   I wanted to know if anyone has any experience with these tools and what their thoughts are on using them? "
95,Does fat negate protein?,"I'm mainly concerned about my diet as it relates to strength building.   I'm not concerned about other factors because I have a fast metabolism and don't seem to gain weight and am active enough that I feel that other concerns do not apply to me.  Something I have been eating a lot of recently is chicekn strips from the supermarket. They are a good price and I like them. Each strip has 3g of protein, 5g of fat and 6 g of carbs.  If I eat say 15, that is 45g of protein which can be used towards my strength building. Will the 75g of fat negate that? Especially since I don't seem to gain weight at all? "

97,Advice on finding a training partner,"I regularly workout on my own but on the occasions I workout with a training partner I find my motivation increases, my output increases and perhaps most importantly, my overall enjoyment increases.  Jason Ferruggia (a world-renowned S&amp;C coach) has always said that having a good training partner is one of the best things you can do to enhance your rate of progress.   With this in mind, how do you go about finding a training partner, if indeed you workout with a partner at all?   Is it possible to walk into a gym and find people there? Is it possible to workout with friends? (Especially if you're there to exercise seriously, rather than catch up and chat)   What experience do you have on finding a training partner? "
98,Is it benificial to take off rest days between bodyweight workouts?,"My regular workout consists of about 3/4 sets of 90 pushups and furthermore some situps. I am 19 years old. Would it be bad to do this workout (almost) every day of the week? And would doing it as often as possible give me maximal results or would I get better results if I took days of rest in between? If so, how many days a week should I work out? "
99,"Why isn't ""setting"" a hand gripper cheating?","Many of those who close massively heavy gripper -- or any gripper at all -- seem to ""set"" the gripper, which means partially close it using both hands to get a better grip on it before completely closing it.  Why isn't this cheating? It's like using two hands to get a barbell off the ground and then holding it a few seconds with one. I don't think that would count as a one-handed deadlift, but whatever. Anyways, I've never used grippers this way and just close them 100% with one hand never set them.  Why isn't the partially-assisting way cheating, but no props given to the harder way? "
100,Mixing Supplements,"Before training I first take BCAA an then creatine, after my training I first take a smaller amount of BCAA and then whey protein.  My question is, if I can mix the BCAA &amp; Creatine powder in one bottle, instead of taking it separately? Same for BCAA &amp; whey protein powder. Is there any use taking them separaterly? "
101,What is a good routine for running in the evening?,"I do racket sports 2 to 3 times a week, but I feel that I need some more exercise. So maybe jogging would be a good thing.  The basic things that I need to do in the mornings are:   eating shower and now running   Obviously, the shower comes after running. But should you eat before or after jogging ? Is running as you get up healthy ? Any tips ? "

104,"I am disabled, can I go to gym?","I am disabled, I use a walker and I'm practicing walking using elbow crutches. I can move my legs, I just can't balance so I have to use aids. My upper body is normal. I want to go to gym, to strengthen my upper muscles so I won't get tired when I walk on the crutches. And I want to strengthen my legs a bit, and my shoulders and back so I can walk better.  I already go do physical therapy but I'm not making any progress, I feel I can do better. Can I go to gym? Or is it impossible for people like me to go to gym?  @DavidR I talked to my pt, asking him if i can go to gym, he said i can, i didn't tell him that i'm not satisfied with what he's doing, i'm gonna try to have that conversion with him soon... So yes he said i can do gym if i want to, the question would i become ""is there any gym workout i can do""? "
105,"What is a ""suitcase"" fall?","A few days ago, I was listening to a discussion of parkour and they mentioned two painful falls you should avoid. One I recognized, the scorpion, which is basically a faceplant where you have sufficient momentum that you wind up with your legs going up into the air and toward your head.    The other was a ""suitcase"" fall and it's driving me crazy for some reason, trying to figure out what they're referring to. Is that like the ""taco"" for a backfall where you land on your back (or the back of your head) and your legs flip forward and over your head?  The context was this ParkourEDU video where they're mentioning that a particular diveroll is superior to ""suitcase or scorpion"" when recovering from a peel-out. I've left a message asking for explanation, but I figured I'll keep this query up here as well. "
106,Am I ready for a long trip in bicycle?,"I've been training for the last three months to complete a 90 Km route. I feel my legs are ready for that, but I'm affraid my weight can be a problem.  I'm 31 years olds, 165 cm tall (5' 5""), and my current weight is 65 Kg (143 pounds).  I've increased progressively the intensity of my training. Now, I complete 10 Km 4 times each week.  What do you think is the maximum weight (given my height) to accomplish this challenge?  Should I increase my training distance before attempting that trip?  Any other recommendation will be helpful.  BR, Sebastian "
107,Is it possible to gain 1.5-2 inches on arms and 2 inches on chest without protein supplement,"I started working out quite recently and my trainer at the gym gave me the following diet plan as soon as I joined:    As you can see, most of the items are regular day to day meals (I'm an Indian and the menu is mostly Indian cuisine). I try my best to follow this plan. Since I'm lactose intolerant, I replaced Milk with Soy Milk. My intention of joining a gym was simple - workout to keep me fit (and keep my tummy flat). But seeing other folks there, I got motivated and asked my trainer how to put on a couple of inches on my chest, one inch on my biceps and half to three-quarter of an inch on my forearms. He immediately suggested taking protein supplements. I have seen my cousin (who was quite a body builder in his early youth) who now has a sagging body which he thinks is the result of taking supplements earlier. I don't want that to happen to me. Now, after about 4 months of regular workouts, I have gained roughly half an inch on my chest and biceps and about a quarter of an inch on my forearm. I did get a few tips from here and here, but nothing specific to my case.  How right was my trainer? Is it hard to achieve my target with a supplement-free diet?   P.S.: I'm a 27 year old, measuring 170cms (5'7"") in height and weighing 58 kgs. "

110,Max heart rate over 190 at 51,"I'm 51 and, when cycling or running, (I do about 120-150 km per week) I find myself comfortable at over 160 BPM and even at 180 BPM for a few km or when climbing a long climb (5-8 km, which means going at 175-184 for 40 mins). During short bursts I can peak at 189 without feeling dizzy or bad in any way other than without air for a while. My average heart rate for a normal workout can be between 150 and 160 and I can have a conversation-filled ride in which I average 145-150. Of course all this goes against the different ways of calculating the max heart rate (which for my age is supposed to be, depending on the method, around 170). What gives? Am I endangering my health? is max heart rate relative. Does anyone know cases similar to mine?  Thanks in advance  "
111,What is the importance of being focused during exercise?,"During workout at the gym, I see people busy with their phones. That made me wonder how does focus help in training? Although to common sense it appeals that I should focus but what exactly happens when we focus? Does it help in better circulation? Does it help to target a specific muscle?  I googled and found this article. There are related questions on stackexchange (Q1 and Q2) but all of these mainly focuses on 'how' to focus rather than 'why' to focus.  Can someone throw light on this, if possible with good references? Has there been any study on this?  Thanks! "

113,Can I increase strength without lifting more weight?,"So I have been doing weight training for a couple of months now. Using the idea of progressive overloading I have been increasing the weight by about 5kg every week or 2 or 3. Since I'm working out at home without a spotter I make sure I'm safely below my max.  My problem is that, with my deadlift, I can now do all the weight I can fit on the bar. My biggest plates are 7.5kg of which I only have 2 and 2x5kg and the rest are 2.5kg. So they are not very tall and thus take a lot of horizontal space on the bar and I can no longer fit any more weight onto the bar. I imagine that I will be having the same problem with my bench press soon as I am only 5kg the bar's maximum.  I am currently looking to buy/make some larger weights but won't be able to do this for a while. In the meantime I would still like to be increasing my strength.  So my question is:  How can I continue to increase my strength without increasing the weight on the bar? Should I do more reps per set? More sets of the same reps? Repeat the exercise daily or twice a day?  Will these alternatives cause me to increase muscle size? I've been doing 5 reps as I've read that this or even less is optimal for training strength without increasing muscle size.  My goal is to increase strength without gaining too much muscle size. "
114,Advantages and downsides of route with slopes,"I am currently jogging every day. I am not in very good shape (hopefully this will change), so I am not jogging a very long route. I am making a loop about 3km long, starting home and ending up back home.  I actually have two choices of loops that I could do, both about the same distance. The main difference is that one is mostly flat Streets, while the other has many slopes. Since I end up exactly where I started, there has to be an equal amount of upward sloping as the amount of downward sloping.  Of course, running 1km on an upward slope is significantly harder than running it on flat ground. On the other hand, running it on a downward slope is usually easier, sometimes so easy that I have to spend efforts on slowing down in order to avoid going down the slope too fast.  I'm pretty sure those two routes won't be equivalent, from a physical effort perspective. This sounds like one of them could be better for cardio, while the other better for muscles, or something like that.  So what are the advantages and downsides of both routes? Is one objectively better (from a fitness perspective) than the other, or does this depend on my goals?  Additional information: I do not have any clear goal. I just started this routine because I'm getting fat, and I'm totally out of shape. I'm not really sure if I want to improve, cardio, muscles, or just lose weight. I just felt like it was time I started doing something, and going for a jog every day is an easy habit to pick up, and I figured it would definitely be good, even if I'm not sure exactly which of those ""goods effects"" it will have, and how much. "
115,"How does frequency affect recovery, controlling for intensity and volume?","What exactly is the body's mechanism to recover from the stress of strength training and to adapt to greater loads, and how does frequency of training affect this mechanism?  For illustration, consider two people not on drugs:   Person A squats 6x5, once every 3 days, with a weight that takes the last rep close to failure. Person B squats 2x5, every day, with a weight that takes the last rep close to failure.   Who gets stronger faster? Three possibilities are:   Person A gets stronger faster. After being stressed by tension and activation near maximal effort, muscles and the nervous system need a minimum amount of time (I've heard 48-72 hours) to recover fully. Stressing them again in that time interrupts the recovery process and voids it. It makes no difference. Person B's muscles and nervous system take one third the time to recover from one third the stress of person A's workout. Both people are getting enough rest. Person B gets stronger faster. Not only are both people getting enough rest, but:   he releases testosterone more often and therefore spends more time in an anabolic state. his reps are higher quality, with better form and more explosiveness, because he's not fatiguing himself with so many sets in one session. Therefore, his average rep recruits muscle fibers more efficiently than person A's average rep, and he is less likely to injure himself.   "
116,Training on an empty stomach vs full,"Just wondering if there's any information on training on an empty stomach and eating afterwards vs training on a full stomach? I have heard (no sources) that eating a proper balanced meal after a workout is 'optimal'.  When pressed for time I often put off eating even when very hungry in favour of doing a workout and then cooking / eating afterwards.  What is the better situation?   Training when actively hungry, (perhaps with a protein shake before training) then cooking and eating a meal in the hour afterwards   vs.   Training within an hour after recently eaten, (perhaps with a protein shake after training)  "
117,Why do carbs make you lose focus during your workout?,"Mr. Olympia competitor Ben Pakulski advises:     Pre-workout. No carbs. Why no carbs? Neurological focus.   Neurotransmitter focus. I find that I get much better brain focus in   my training and ends up giving me better overall outcome.   Source: [website]An article from Forbes also says low carbs increase vigilance at the expense of hurting other traits:     When consuming low-carb diets in the short term, this is certainly true. In a 2008 study, psychologists placed 19 women on either a calorie restricted low-carb diet or a calorie restricted high-carb diet for 28 days. Throughout the study, participants’ memory, reaction time, and vigilance were tested at regular intervals. While those on the low-carb diet enjoyed a slight boost in vigilance, they suffered impaired reaction time and reduced visuospatial memory.   Source: [website]Neither of these sources explained why low carbs increase focus/vigilance. What is the reason?  "
118,What to do if you have backpain due to many hours of sitting although going to the gym between those hours?,"What to do if you have backpain due to many hours of sitting although going to the gym between those hours?  I mean that are there any good (rather finnish if possible) sites on computer ergonomics? I know that one needs to keep about rest every one hour, but how long and what should I do? I know what I can do, but how long?  And then this backpain is focused on middle back and I notice that when I sit straight, this pain occurs, but when little leaning against back, it does not seem to be so much pain than previously.  "
119,How to Train Abs?,"This came up in another question here - we had a little debate about the efficacy of crunches vs planks, etc.   So, in short, what is the best way to train your abs without risking your spine too much and while relying on the abs (rather than the hip flexors) for the majority of the movement?   What's the progression? Let's say you got to the point where crunches and planks are a joke. What then?   What is a good test of abdominal strength?   P.S. I was sure someone asked this question before, but I can't find it.  "
120,push up routine for lean and toned chest,I am doing push ups every day in the following manner:  1:  2 X 14 standard push ups 2:  2 X 10 declined push ups 3:  2 X 8 push ups using fists   I often heard doing push ups other day build chest muscle and I'm only intending to tone my chest muscle and not building it.  Will my current routine help me to build a lean and toned chest or should I give a day break off after each push ups or should I stop doing push ups and only do cardio? How should the push up routine go for a heavy chest (just for information) and for a lean toned chest?  I weigh 67 kg with 173 cm height 
121,Is it OK to do Cardio on a weight training rest day?,"Right now I alternate between Push weights day, and Pull weights day. Then after that is a rest day. So the flow looks like:  Weights Weights Rest Weights Weights  Rest ...   I do cardio for warm up and cool down (10 minutes warm up, 10 minutes warm down) on the weights day but obviously most of my time is put on weights.  Is it OK to do cardio on my rest days where I do no weights whatsoever? I use the rower for my cardio and would use that for the rest days.  Would this cardio impact my muscle rest/growth and result in them not repairing as quickly?  EDIT:  By cardio i mean burning around 400 cals to help reduce my weight while gaining muscle. "
122,How can I lose muscle mass in my quads and ham strings (thighs?),"I would really appreciate the help on how to lose muscle mass in the thigh area? Ever since I recovered from weight loss (40kg back up to 46kg, age 20, female, 1.66m), I started taking lysine and other pills to help put on muscle and general mass.   I love to run and I started running faster (11mphr) for shorter periods of time when I gained stamina...but now my thighs have bulked up! I mean the rest of me is quite stick-like, small calves, sticky arms, flat stomach, but now my thighs are much bigger and more muscular than ever! How can I get rid of this?   I know some people think this looks great and they love it, but its just not my look and I prefer to be slimmer like I use to be before I started running. Should I just stop running all together? What should I be eating? Should I run slower at day 7mphr and do yoga and Pilates?  Thank you so much!  "
123,Can one get ripped by just playing a/some sport(s)?,"I've been getting in shape lately. I was kind of fat some months ago and I'm not anymore (thanks to a bit of running, a bit of sports like volleyball, and a bit of eating better). I have a decent body now, with a good BMI.  My next logical step would be to gain a bit of muscle now. The problem is, I've tried to go to gyms, but I struggle to keep my pace to keep going to them or practice my abs exercises. However I never struggle about playing sports, because they're fun. So I'm wondering if there could be a way to get ripped by playing sports? If yes, what would be the best sport to do this? Thanks! "
124,Best way to achieve muscle activation in the lower abs?,"I have back problems and need to work on my posture, one element is the lower ab to 'pull' my lower back into a more upright position (I tend to fall into a hollow back).    When I ask about activation, I mean this: get the relevant muscles to stay tense and active for a long time after the workout so that my posture stays OK with less conscious effort. What is a training modality or exercise to achieve this effect?  I'm mostly looking at planks and kneeling ab-wheel rollouts as exercises that have, I think, a more max-strength focus for me but I also occasionally do exercises with a stronger strength-endurance focus.  Should I prioritize one over the other to achieve muscle activation? "
125,"Resume training for a marathon after forced break, one month left, recommend a plan","I have trained for Kuala Lumpur 2013 marathon since April. The marathon is on 30th June. I have injured my heel in the training and I was out for 4 weeks in May. I have started training again last weekend with 7km, 10km and yesterday 12.5km. The heel feels fine, just needs more careful stretching before and after. Now I have exactly one month to prepare for the marathon. I have already run a marathon last year (Mt. Fuji) in November in 4:35.   I used to do one or two interval trainings, two long runs and two 60 min runs a week to prepare for the last marathon. I have ran the longest distance (almost 42km) about 3 weeks before marathon and then I reduced the distance until the marathon day. This worked well for me then. After marathon I just kept running 10km few times a week until April.  But what should I do now? My biggest concern is that my muscles and joints might not be ready for 42km. How should I prepare? I am definitely not fit enough to run as fast as last time, but I was thinking I should be able to run it in 5:30-5:45 with breaks.  "
126,Correct technique for ab wheel rollout or must the hip flexors work isometrically?,"I see two slightly distinct ways to do kneeling ab wheel rollouts.   Hip does not bend, hip flexors are worked isometrically only, movement extends only as far as this is doable. As seen in this youtube viseo and on exrx Highly similiar to the first in the outward part of the movement, but the guy actually advises to slightly crunch in the inward part. As seen here.   My observation is that when extending too far, I cannot do the backward portion without a slight, active tuck from the abs. For me, as I have lower back problems, I will do the first version and probably use a door or something to limit range of movement to something managable. Better safe than sorry and all that.     Ultimately, which version is safer, which is more effective and why?  "
127,"When running out of breath, keep breathing rhythm or take in air?","I am trying to learn how to breathe better for all of the different types of exercises I do - working out, grappling, and cycling.   I've read a lot about how to breathe and different techniques to improve breathing etc. what I really want to know is at points when one is really struggling to maintain breathing rhythm, and really feels like they need to take in air (which will interrupt the correct rhythm) what is better to do? Although it feels like taking in an extra bit of air is really satisfying it seems like its the wrong thing to do and that i should put more effort into keeping the rhythm and ensuring I breathe out all that i can before taking in more air.  My question is: will taking in air like this just be a short term gain and mean that in the longer term (towards the end of the workout) the body will not appreciate it (as I didn't manage to breathe out all of the air)?  "
128,Is this back program complete?,"I have some years of strength training experience but haven't lifted in a couple of years.   To get back on track I am following a Starting Strengh/Stronglifts hybrid (basically stronglifts 3x5).   I have always had a bad posture (arched back and forward head), and being a desk jockey isn't helping it either. I always notice that when my (back) strength goes up, my posture improves.  That is why I decided to do a little extra for the back. Build a little bit of extra muscle and extra strength by introducing a dedicated back day.  This is the program I came up with:  Pullup negs (alternate between neutral, pronated and supinated grip): 10x1   Deadstop db rows (with straps so I can focus more on lats): 3x8   Snatch grip high pull: 8x3   Seated cable rows: 5x8   Wide grip lat pull down (alternate BTN and front): 3x15   I must say I haven't gone to failure yet on any exercise, but it is a heavy program. I am pretty exhausted the hours after I have completed this workout. More than on my strength days.  My question is: I know that DOMS is not a measure of an effective workout, but with this amount of volume and intensity I would expect to get at least a little bit sore. What do you think of this program? Would you think it is effective in building strength and/or size?  So I want to know if it would be effective for strength/size not whether or not it would improve my posture. "

130,Can bodyweight exercises induce body recomposition?,"Here's my wacky theory.  The human body is extremely complex, but looking at it as a black box which aggressively adapts to external challenges, could performing bodyweight exercises (with added weight when necessary) induce fat loss more when compared to similar non-bodyweight based exercise?  For example:   Pullups (with weight)  vs.  Seated overhead cable pull-downs Pushups (with weight)  vs.  Benchpress Dips    (with weight)  vs.  Seated dip machine Running                vs.  Stationary Biking   In every exercise, the body adapts to make that exercise easier the next time.  Bodyweight exercises are easier when you have more muscle and less fat, i.e. a higher power to weight ratio.  Incidentally, that is also the very thing a lot of people are trying to achieve with their physique when they start working out.  Lose some fat, maybe add some muscle.  Could focusing on exercises which are sensitive to (affected by) one's own bodyweight induce the body to adapt its power to weight ratio?  Has this been tested or studied scientifically?  I couldn't find any studies looking at this, but maybe you've come across some?  Thanks for reading! "
131,Weakness in shoulder a few days after archery. Why did I get weaker why?,"I am a 14 year old girl, and not in very good shape. 5 days ago I went to archery practice, with my 40lb bow.   The first 40 arrows weren't a problem for me, but when I got to 50 I began to shake. I stretched out and went home. The days after my muscles were very sore.   5 days later the soreness was gone. I tried to pull back the bow and I felt so much weaker than last time I used the bow. Did I do something wrong or do I just need more rest? Or is it something else?  I just don't know why I got weaker. "

I'd appreciate any advice so I can quickly get started while I start learning - the less the better for motivational reasons. I don't expect a quick result, I just want to get started quickly, not get overwhelmed, but learn more as I go. [Edited]  Among others, I've read the following:   Are these Workout Routines right for Body Building Body building and gaining weight Getting enough calories with a suppressed appetite   My goal: I want to build bulk. I don't hope to build BIG, just want a big-ish athletic appearance.   My situation: I have very little fat, a little bit of muscle, but low strength. I have a low appetite. I'm very much out of shape and can't exercise for long.  My thoughts for how to proceed:    Exercises per session: push ups, pull ups, squats, sit-ups, and more as I learn about them. I will start with about 15-20 minutes per session. I suspect this is not the best way to start, as the links suggest I should aim for about an hour's worth per session. Stretches: at beginning and end of session, say 10-15 minutes before and after. Frequency of sessions: 3 times per week as suggested in posts. Could I multiply that by doing two or three sessions per day? Or should I stick to one? Food: At the moment: I drink a lot of full-fat milk, cooked fish, and beef (jerkey and cooked), drink tons of fruit juice. I also pig out on danish pastries, from what I can tell the pastry is not a good idea, but the nuts at least are beneficial, but maybe I should stop eating those? I plan to: keep my diet besides the danish pastries, it seems I'm vaguely on the right track already? I will eat more white potatoes, and fresh fruit / veg. Given my low appetite I will look into various drinks.    Any quick-start advice and/or thoughts on the above would be hugely appreciated! "

Considering the difference in effort between 120 kg and 130 kg, I expected to have a relatively easy 140 kg and most likely grind a 145 kg lift. Yet, my 140 kg attempt came to a complete stop. After exhaling, if it wasn't for the belt pushing against my ribs, I know I would have folded in half. Admittedly, my knees shifted back and my hips went up, so I can appreciate how a good morning position would put extreme pressure on my core.  Here is an older attempt at 125 kg @ 82 kg. I don't believe I get in a good morning position there, yet it still happens. I have relatively long legs for my height, so I except to get quite a bit of a torso lean.  My DL is at a ridiculous 190 kg with great form, yet no sign of even being close to my limit of losing bracing.  I know I brace slightly differently between the two lifts. For the squat, I try to take in as much air as possible and keep everything tight, while for the DL I take a smaller breath or the pressure and general feeling of about to explode makes me sick.  So, what gives? Am I just generally weak in the squat and my sticking point breaks my form down? Is my core weak? If there could be various reasons, how do I go about figuring out which one it is?  I don't know if it matters, but when my low bar was at 120 kg, I had to grind 3x5 @ 80 kg front squats and I'm almost certain I wouldn't have had a single at 90 kg. I don't do front squats frequently, but still, the effort exerted was on a completely different level.  I haven't done direct ab work in forever, because I noticed my core strength improved so much more with just squats. "
135,How close to accurate is a HR sensor for calorie burn?,"I have a basic Polar HR sensor. Am in very good shape and do lots of cardio a week. In a 60 minute cardio session I can hardly break 400 calorie burn while my friends boast over 600 burn with a Fitbit and I am in WAY better shape physically than they are. My HR stays within the predetermined range and is average about 153 for about 45 minutes. I have checked and rechecked the data input info for my monitor.  I really just wanted the most simple device I can get for HR, calorie burn etc.  Is it because I do not have a lot of fat to burn and that my heart is in good shape and that I have a fast recovery?  BTW my heart rate drops very fast during a minute rest.  My doctor say my EKG is EXCELLENT! Should I consider a different device?  "
136,What are the functional effects of hypertrophy?,"Hypertrophy means that your muscles are bigger, but does this mean that they don't perform better or worse than smaller muscles?  Is it really possible for hypertrophy of the muscles to have no functional effects? Would you gain at least some strength? Are there any negative functional effects? I've heard that bigger muscles makes you less flexible, is this true?  So what are the functional effects both positive and negative of hypertrophy? "
137,Hip stretches - recover from piriformis syndrome and hard gluteal muscles,"Situation  Due to a one sided sport I intensely practiced for a good portion of my teenage years(rowing in a team with only one oar per person), I have ever since experienced an awkward tight feeling in my hip when I stand up in the morning. After intense exercises I regularly feel a burn radiating down my leg on the outside of my thighs. I extreme cases and when it's very cold, I have a tingling sensation in my toes that makes me want to kick and stomp everything - the pain is really not a big deal, it is just so annoying!   My very competent sports doctor diagnosed a piriformis syndrome. The radiating pain is caused by the muscle pressing on the Sciatic nerve. Unfortunately for me in addition to that, my entire gluteus is also extremely cramped up. My physiotherapist suggested puncturing the muscles with a needle that will causes the muscle to twitch and eventually relax. In my case the needles just bent.. this gives you and idea of how severely these muscles are cramped. The therapist said it is very unusual for these needles to bend, as they are quite thick.   I searched all over the place for ways to help my muscles relax: massages, needle therapy, ultra wave therapy, stretches, no running, more running, more bicycle,   Eventually I decided to take to extreme measures: at the local gym I used a machine to train external hip rotation with weights. I tried less weight and many reps until muscle failure/exhaustion, and I tried big weights with less reps, both slow and fast. I did this together with stretches and massages over 6 months now. It has become slightly better, but gluteus is still severely cramped, and in the meantime I have peaked on the weights (machine cannot do more than 110kg).  I forgot to mention that I have no complaints whatsoever during activity, even under maximum loads.   My questions:   There is the possibility of injecting cortisone directly into the affected muscles, which makes them lazy as a couple of drunk cats. Increasing load slowly after the treatment, I should be able to rehabilitate the muscles. Does anyone have experience with this cortisone injection (or similar)? I have quite an uneasy feeling about it, not sure why. Does anyone have alternative methods, procedures, exercises that could help me?    Thanks for taking your time and reading this, it means a lot to me.  "
138,Foundational Stetches for CrossFit,"I feel like there are so many mobility stretches out there for your body, but which ones do you really need to do.  To be an all around CrossFit athlete and have continual gains you must improve your mobility just as much as you weightlift/strength train and perform metcons.  This means you should have good mobility in:   Wrist Shoulder Hip Ankle  Am I missing any? By performing these they will aid in performing the following foundation of CrossFit movements:   Overhead Squat, Deadlift, Push Press, Snatch, Clean &amp; Jerk, Push Jerk  I'm trying to find out what series of mobility exercises I should repetitively do in order to aid in the above movements. What's the timeframe and frequency of doing these? "

140,what's the reality that keeps progressive strength training from being constant?,"I'm looking at my progressive intermediate weight training program, and I'm a little more than halfway through my 12 week program. As expected it's been terrific, I've steadily been gaining strength in all areas, and I'm PR'ing every week.   But if I'm able to squat 300 (3RM) right now, and I'm going to keep chugging away at the intermediate program schedule, a 2% weekly increase means that in 52 weeks I'd be squatting 840lbs (I did some quick Excel math).  So my questions would be:   Is there something inherently off in my math? Rippetoe and others have said that most folks will spend their entire lives in the intermediate range, which makes me think that there's something much bigger going on since strict adherence would propel you out of the intermediate stage within a year. Or we're saying that someone squatting 840lb is ""intermediate"".  Are there hidden de-loading / weekly rest periods going on that I'm missing, and are these documented somewhere?   My spreadsheet math below. I tried to follow the idea of weekly compounding 2% gains. I capped the time at 26 weeks for sake of not having an incredibly long image below, but at 52 weeks it gets to 840.    "
141,Does anyone know what causes muscles to shake uncontrollably while under stress?,"My question is related to the following, I think:   Why is my body shaking during certain exercises?    I would like to know how this works on the muscle/biology level. The best thing I can imagine, is that the body switches very quickly in between using different muscle groups, so that the ones under stress get some rest. It does this as a sort of self-preservation so that certain muscle groups don't get damaged by being overstressed. Can anyone confirm this - or is my thinking wrong?  It's interesting to me, because it happens on all muscle groups when I'm tired, but always in my stomach area, and maybe I need to do a different exercise to train the concerned muscles individually on a smaller scale (if possible). "
142,Is there an accurate way to assess the fast/slow-twitch muscle fiber ratio in your legs?,"I've been running on and off for the past 12 years, having originally started in high school with XC. Given that fact, I've typically always been interested in running longer distances, however, within the past year or so, I've shifted my focus to sprinting.  From what I currently understand about the matter, sprinters prefer having a high ratio of fast-twitch muscle fibers. What I would like to know, or at least get some idea of, is what kind of fast/slow-twitch muscle fiber ratio my legs contain (without going to the hospital and requesting a biopsy, if that's even possible).  Upon searching YouTube, I wasn't really able to find any videos that demonstrate how to get an assessment of this ratio, other than this video, however, the guy is testing his chest, and, IMO, his test doesn't seem to be designed very well.  That being said, is there a way to at least somewhat accurately test the fast/slow-twitch muscle fiber ratio, specifically in your legs? "
143,Calves hurt in the front (the tibialis anterior muscle) from walking fast?,"I often brisk walk for rapid reaching of destination, and my legs aren't in bad shape; I have always been a walker, do calf exercises, but the front part of the calf (as mentioned in title). Why would it hurt? I didn't know that muscle needs to be worked.  Does the tibialis anterior need exercise directly (isolated) to get stronger, or is the pain there from walking from another potential reason? "
144,Running and swimming in the morning combination,"I am going to Spain for 2 months.  The place is 1 km from the sea.  My question is what morning workout do you suggest for me?  I get up regularly at 6:05 in the morning every day and then I have time to 8:00.  What combination of actvities in the morning do you suggest?   Should I run on mon, wed, fri and swim on tue, thu and maybe on weekend?  I would like to have free weekends if possible (maybe except a little swimming).  I am not curious about intensity, but more about when to do what.   I mean, if I should run more or swim more.  Combining these two in one day is quite difficult, because running ""wet"" is a little dangerous.  But if you know some tips how to run after swimming (notice I don't want to run bare-foot or in flip-flops ;)), then let me know.  EDIT:  I am not a bodybuilder nor a triathlon athlete. My aim is to stay fit and sexy ;) therefore 45 - 60 min max for a morning workout. My main concern is that running can lead to knee/ankle injuries because I have 93kg and I am 187 cm tall. But I don't want to loose much weight I like how I look right now. Could the weight be the problem in the long time period? I was running 3 times a week (mo, we, fr) for 5 months now and I am quite accustomed to that, eventhough sometimes I walk for a while and not run all the way (especially if I staid up late at night the previous day). But I definitely see some progress. I don't run very long distances only about 5-6 km and I do some push ups, dips, pull ups etc. "
145,muscle group schedule and creatine cycling,"I am 20 yrs old and 61kg(134.482 lbs) is it ok if i work-out the whole week as long as I isolate the different muscle group?  Mon: Chest / Lower Back Tues: Bicep / Tricep Wed: Shoulder / Legs and so on...   I am doing HIIT. a 30 sec rest every set and 4 sets / exercise the weights are on my limits. im trying to push myself for atleast 4-6 and 8-12 reps. Estimated body fat percentage 10-13%. I almost dropped off from 20-30% body fat. 170lbs down to 134.482 lbs. and I am just wondering if increasing the frequency of my work-out could help me achieve the 7% body fat much faster. I have experience working out for about 4 years ago, and after that i just go to the gym when i have time because of my schedule and now I am free every night, trying to get back on track. I just got back to the gym for about 1 month. I cut off my weight for about 3 months of high intensity cardio and now I want to build muscles.  I am almost done with the loading phase of creatine 20g / day. the maintenance phase would be 5g / day right? should I cycle creatine intake? should I give it a rest after 4-8weeks? and 4weeks off creatine then back to loading phase? or straight to maintenance? and I take creatine before working out with apple juice. any suggestion with what time of the day would be best to take creatine. "
146,What is the name of the test I had on my first day at gym?,"I had been diagnosed diabetic recently and hence decided to go to gym for the first time.  The gentleman there gave me a test that I suppose is checking my fitness or metabolism and it was basically done by putting me no the cycling machine, keep raising the resistance while taking the readings of my heart rate at the end of each 5 min on the specific resistance level, then move to the higher resistance. I guess this test indicated to him that I haven't been exercising and I am not in a good shape and he chose some introductory plan for me to start with.  My question is what is this test called and what is it exactly testing?  Can I do it to myself?  Is getting better scores on this test means my body is burning sugars better which means better position with my diabetes?  [EDIT] Just wanted to add that the final equation was using my weight, age, and the heart rate against each resistance level to get a final number. "

The truth is I want to obtain muscle but with no eating it can't be obtained ,I don't want to have muscle with ldl cholesterol.About me ,I can eat everything .I eat healthy vegetables,protein, fruits and right foods.As far as I read is bad.My questions  are is doing bad in my muscles growth( on entire body) the ldl cholesterol? Strength ,if there is ldl cholysterol influence the blood so influence and the strength we gain when we workout?I mean if i have high level ldl that will be doing me not to obtain strength as i would gain if my cholyaterol ldl was low.Additional,ldl affecting height gain?The bones?etc? example ,milk is have a lot of calcium needed for height but it has a lot cholesterol, so milk isn't helpful for gain height,right?Cholesterol ldl is doing bad in blood so no much muscle gain ,no much strength gain ,no much height gain as a result doing bad in whole body? "
148,Integrating Front lever into training plan - which muscles are used?,"I'm currently doing a typical push-pull workout in the gym, mostly with basic exercises (bench press, squat, dead lift, weighted pullup, ...) and low reps. Now I would like to integrate the front lever into my training. I can currently only perform a quite crappy strongly tucked form, however I feel that my triceps are the limiting factor and not so much the core stability.  All tutorials suggest that you train your core stability with dragon flags and the like. When I do the tucked variant my triceps burn like mad, and afterwards feel quite destroyed (I nearly completely lock out my elbows). It is however a very localized pain right in the middle at the thickest area. Could it be the spot where the tendons from the back muscles attach to the back of the upper arm bone (humerus), and that I'm only mistaking it for triceps pain? When doing the exercise I think about pushing my (nearly) locked out arms towards my hips, and then it really starts burning.  With the intesity of this excerise I only want to do it every 5 days or so, so this spot can properly adapt without being destroyed again before it can heel. I think of the front lever as a back excerise, hence it should be placed in the pull workout day, but this strong triceps pain makes me wonder if it would be better placed in the push day. What do you think is better?  Are my triceps muscles or tendon pain holding me back?   Should I also think about pulling my shoulder blades downwards? "
149,Why Rippetoe's Texas or Mehdi's StrongLifts instead of Reg Park original workouts?,"I first learnt about Rippetoe's 3x5 program, but the Power Clean seems risky for me for the moment, so I looked for something similar and found Mehdi's Stronglifts. But after one or two sessions of Mehdi's workout, I felt the need to add Pull-ups (well, equivalently, Cable Pulldowns) and more recently, some forearm work. It seems to be working well for me, although it is still too soon to claim to have any result.  But a few minutes ago I have found the origin of both Rippetoe and Mehdi workouts. It was Reg Park who invented the 3x5 (or at least he made it popular) back in the 50s. The most surprising fact is that Reg Parks original workout is almost identical to my modified version of Mehdi with Pull-ups and forearms. See for instance here  Now, my question is: is there something ""wrong"" with the original Reg Park workouts and therefore the need of Mehdi/Rippetoe? What are the improvements of Mehdi/Rippetoe with respect to the original Reg Park workouts? "

151,"Arms are too long to snatch? Advice, please!","I've searched this forum and can't find anything similar to what I'm about to ask, so will go ahead and do so.  I currently have a bodyweight snatch, so I don't think I""m doing too badly with the way I'm lifting at the moment, but whenever I'm about to initiate that big pull from the hips (the second pull?), the bar is never in my hips! It's actually in the lower portion of my thigh (i.e. close to my knees, sometimes mid-thigh).  If I stand up tall/straight with the bar in my snatch grip, it isn't in my hip crease, but mid-thigh somewhere. However, if I was to widen my grip so that the bar was in my hips, I just don't feel very stable in the overhead squat position and feel that the bar is too close to my head, and I don't think my wrists like the strain (as it is a particularly wide!).  Is this a case of getting my wrists accustomed to a wider grip? Or would it be a case of a premature arm bend before that final pull so that the bar gets into the hips? Or should I just continue snatching as I am? I just feel that the way I'm currently snatching is actually not making the most of the potential power I can generate if that bar was in my hips.  Thank you very much for reading and for any advice/guidance :) "
152,Good resistance bands for the office?,"I work a distance from home and find it difficult to commit to getting to the gym after work, which I'm trying to do because I want to build more muscle. I was thinking that a good, strong resistance band looped over my chair leg could let me work my biceps here in the office after hours, when most have gone home. This way I can do 30mins training and then go straight home. Can anybody tell me what I should look for in a good, strong resistance band? Or any known durable brands? I was gonna order some online. To give you an idea of resistance level I currently use a barbell to bicep curl 45kg, so I'm guessing something equivalent to 15-20kg would be good.  EDIT: To answer Moses' question, the problem with getting to the gym after work is the time of night I get there. Between the office and home there is often a lot of traffic, so I get to work early and I don't leave until late to avoid sitting in queues. So I usually leave at almost 7pm. Get to the gym at 8pm, do a workout for an hour, return home and cook, sleep... back up early to return to the office.  My thinking is that I can do some bicep curls or similar here in the office while I wait for the traffic to clear. It is not ideal and I'd rather be using the gym equipment, but it is not possible every night of the week. "
153,How to change your morning and workout routine when moving new time zone?,I'm going for a long vacation to a different time zone (around 8 hours difference with what I live in now).

154,rounded shoulders in planks,"Recently , I record my self doing planks and squats. After I was supposing I am doing them right,  I detect that:  during planks: my sholders are directed down and they are  making  my upper back  to appear like a mountain and I dont know what to do with my head  During squats:  my upper body is shifted forward and  it is rounded  I  am not able to go to gym due to my work time, I work  from  8 am  till 8 pm, so usually I do my workout at moring (6 am). So I have no coach to help me fix this.   Can some one here help me?   what should i do to make my plank in the correct form? what muscle should be strengthened so that  I get rid of the rounded shoulders.   Note : I find this answer on this answer on this website, Plank Progressions,  I am not sure it is sufficient for  me.  Thank you in advance. "
155,Stiff calf after 20 minutes of cycling,"My doctor has recommended cycling to heal from a leg injury.  I think it is working, but, unfortunately, another problem is arising.  My right leg was injured (in the Adductor) and I seem to compensate it by making more effort with the left leg. I end up with a stiff calf after 20 minutes of heavy-ish cycling. To avoid a new injury, I have to wait a couple of days before going back to the gym.  How can I reduce this stiffness ? Should I drink more liquids ? Eat bananas ? (they are cheap here, I am from Brazil. And I remember hearing something about cramps and bananas) Do some sort of warm up exercise ? (which ?) "
156,Why am I falling back when I am squatting?,"I started doing squats a couple of weeks ago, and I'm having trouble maintaining balance near the bottom of my squat (when I'm trying to go below parallel). Let me describe the situation.  Squat stance: I keep my legs shoulder with apart. My heels line up with my shoulders, and I point my feet about 15 degrees outward. I squat down so I am in a ""third world squat"" stance and my knees are in line with my feet. I stand back up and that is my starting squat stance.  When I squat, I place the bar on my traps, take a deep breath, and bend at the knees. Once I reach a sufficient bend in the knees (meaning not beyond my toes), I try to do the do the rest of the squat by bending at the hips--like I am squatting in to a chair. Anyways, as I get close to parallel, I start experiencing some problems with my balance/form--like I am tipping backwards. The only way I can compensate is to allow my knees to travel beyond my toes. I know that a little about dos/donts of squatting, and I know that it is generally an indication of poor form if I allow my knees to travel beyond my toes, but it's the only way I can get below parallel. After that, I push back out of the hole and the squat is complete.   So my question is pretty clear: why am I falling back when I am squatting? And: is knee travel beyond my toes a necessarily a bad thing? "
157,How to switch from sprints to swimming longer distances,"I've been swimming for 1,5 year and 4 times per week in average. I had a period of 6-7 trainings during a week and with spring coming I switched 2-3 trainings to running finally because this is simply more fun and unfortunately I've found myself to be sick of swimming at the end of winter. I'm amateur not professional swimmer. That's why my goal is to be fit and have fun. But I want to improve my performance too, of course.  I was asked to participate in 500 m free style amateur swimming race.   The problem is that I'm sprinter. I really VERY enjoy fast speed and my favourite distance is 50 and 100 m. And I would say this is the reason why I like swimming. Experience that beautiful feeling of literally cutting water in a high speed. I use short fins or/and swimming paddles very often during my workout. I simply internally LOVE 50-100 m of burst then some time of rest and doing these intervals again and again.  I know what to do, I know how to train. My question is more likely psychological.   How to force my mind not sprinting the first 100 m of 500 m race and not totally exhaust myself so I'm not able to finish a race in a good time?  Of course I'm able to swim 500 m but I find it very boring, very slow and I can't enjoy it now with current mind set.  How you are dealing with is? Is it possible to switch my mind and body set from sprinter to long race swimmer? "
158,Exercise for standing from position sitting on the ground?,"If I'm sitting on a chair or even on a low step, I have no problems standing up with no assistance or touching or holding onto anything.  If I'm sitting butt on the ground, I don't seem to have the strength to stand straight up without pulling myself up or rolling onto all fours or using momentum.  As long as my feet are a couple of inches lower, I'm fine, but once they're on the same level, I'm stuck.   What exercise would be best for this?  Proper squats seem to stop with your thighs at about a 90 degree angle to your body and calves.  What helps when your heels are touching your but and your thighs are pressed to your stomach? "
159,Are there two or four movements for each rep of a Single-Leg Romanian deadlift?,"The description in the book describes touching the right hand in front of the left foot while the right leg goes up, then says to repeat it with the left hand going down, and that you've completed one rep when you've done that. Then, it says to switch legs. So, when doing ladders (1 rep, then 2 reps, then 3 reps, etc), is one to do the right leg twice as one rep, then do left twice, right twice as the second two reps, and so on? Or is ""one rep"" supposed to be twice on the right and twice on the left?  I would consult his website, but the forum seems to perpetually be down. "

Let's say I have to consume less than 1800 calories a day in order to lose fat. Can I hit the gym before one of my main meals, lunch for example, and then instead of having a normal lunch I would take proteins (chicken breast, eggs, potatoes, etc...) so that hopefully I can gain muscles ?

167,Should I get 7h of sleep or as much as I need (namely 12h)?,"I remember a study that showed that people who get less or more than 7h of sleep die sooner (the larger the deviation, the sooner they die). However, I don't think this study normalized against factors that are correlated with excessive/deprived sleep.    I currently sleep 12h a day and I'm okay with it because I value my sleep time more than awake time unlike this person. If I sleep less than 12h, I notice that I'm tired during the day. Some people say that they feel lazy and cognitively impaired if they sleep 12h, but this is not the case with me.  I have seen both the 7h recommendation as well as the ""sleep as much as you need to"" recommendation. Which one is the best one in my situation?  This question has previously been asked when the original poster asked if his 5h are enough. The top rated answerer was skeptical, and quoted the NIH: ""Some people appear to need only about 7 hours to avoid problem sleepiness, whereas others need 9 or more hours of sleep"". My main question is with respect to the ""or more"" in the NIH quote: Is 12h of sleep still reasonable/healthy? "
168,"How different or ""sub-optimal"" is Deadlift if performed with reverse grip (both hands)?","Ok, Deadlift is a great exercise. But I don't dare lifting heavy yet, because of an old injury. However, when performed with reverse grip (both hand with palms facing forwards, I believe this is called supine grip, but I am not sure) I feel it is safer. The area where that old injury is, somehow feels less compromised, less stressed.  But then, is that variation of Deadlift dangerous? Does it target very different muscles? Do I miss the good properties of the normal Deadlift by reversing the grip? "
169,How to incorporate abs into a weekly schedule?,"It seems to be popular to spread abs exercises over the weekly schedule — e.g. one exercise at the end of every training.  OTOH there is an option to do abs all on one day, alone or combined with another muscle group (back?).  Which option is considered more effective? "
170,How to convert hanging hand grip strength to pounds per square inch?,"I know the title may be off putting such as the matter of this question, but is there any reasonable way to find out how strong one's crushing hand grip strength is from the amount of weight resistance from hanging on a bar?  For example, see, I do not own a gripper, so I thought that support grip (used for hanging) can possibly transfer or equate yo some comparable form of crushing hand strength in pounds per square inch.  Like, for example, a 400 lb person can support their body weight hanging from a bar or beam, and I weigh 200 lbs so I would need an extra 200 lbs to match that equivalent support grip. Can the support strength be translated in to squeezing, crushing grip strength, as applied on a gripper? "
171,"When starting weights, do I need to take breaks?","I'm 35 and have essentially no prior training experience (only done walking and cycling).  I've just started trying to work out more systematically to make my body more fit; I've been pretty out of shape due to illness and other problems.  I also want an increase in upper body strength, though not by much; just enough to be 'normal.'  I've struggled with starting exercising for the usual reasons.  I've read most of the questions here for beginners.  I've now found a  new trick to encourage me to continue, and have started with the routine given here.  I have two questions:   The program talks of doing some basic exercises with dumbbells.  But I'd always heard (in my complete ignorance) that you should not do weight exercises every day, but should take breaks between days.  Would that apply even to these basic exercises? Generally, what problems might occur with these exercises?  Should I watch out for strains from the dumbbells?  "
172,Better muscle memory(dancing) after weight lifting,"I tend to learn dance moves much more quickly after I've had a weight lifting workout or even during. Of course, not from the very exhausting ones, but still with huge muscles pump.  Why is that? One of my assumptions is because I'm flexing more while doing the moves. It is still confusing, though. If that was the case, wouldn't every dancer do a weight lifting workout before a dance workout? And most don't. "
173,What should I do if I can just barely complete the lift sets?,"It is often recommended to do a given number of sets of a given number of repetitions of weight lifts (regardless of your exact training methodology, which mainly dictates the number of sets and repetitions), and add weight when you are able to do that. I can see the logic in this, and it has been discussed at least once already on the site.  However, when exactly should you add weight? Let's say you are just barely able to finish the exercise with good form, whatever exactly ""good form"" means to you. Should you add weight the next time around, or should you keep working on that level until you aren't reaching total muscle exhaustion? Why? Does your personal level of fitness make a difference here? "
174,Do I need to be in calorie surplus to get stronger?,"I'm kinda a weak person compared to other people who are at my age (mid 20s) and I want to build some basic strength (or actually, even get stronger than an average person).  I'm in a caloric deficit right now. Can I get stronger while I'm losing weight(fat) ? Can I lift weights, do pushups, etc.. and build strength? (I barely can do even 10 pushups at this point)  What about nutrition, Do I have to take lots of proteins? "
175,Does Intermittent fasting increase growth hormone secretion without negating strength gain benefits?,"I have heard many claims, and done some reading, but I am not qualified by any means to determine the truth of the matter:     Question: Will Intermittent fasting, increase growth hormone secretion significantly, and is this benefit not mitigated by some other consequence of fasting?   This is in regard to wanting to gain strength and or size. Does intermittent fasting actually increase GH and not cause negative effects that cancel this benefit? Is it worth doing for strength training?  If what I am reading is true, I have no idea why all bodybuilders and power lifters wouldn't be intermittent fasting. (This is how I feel about all wild claims like this. If they are really as effective as stated, why aren't they widely used) "
176,Are all resistance bands the same?,"I am planning to buy a resistance band to do weighted pushups, stretching and assisted pull ups. Are all resistance bands the same? Will they all give me the same resistance/assitance?  Like, if I buy one from a local store then will it really give me good assitance and resistance?  Also, can you please link me to good amazon resistance bands if you know any? I am 70 kg and 6 feet in height. My age is 16. I can't buy bands from ""america only"" websites as the shipping cost is very high tho..  Thanks! :) "
177,Not making anymore improvements from strength training ... reasons why?,"I do not have any perfect routine or regimen, but often at least once a week I do strength-only training, and the weights are not getting easier, the reps are not coming in easier, and I am not showing virtually any improvements I can notice in overall strength anywhere.  I have been stuck at a 50 lb max strict dumbbell curl for about 1 rep for several years; I have tried different forms of exercise, chin ups, weighted chin ups, cement bag lifts, barbell, dumbbell, etc. I always keep reps low for only myofibril training and nervous system application; muscle mass is of no importance to my purpose of exercise, so do not gove any advice on sarcoplasmic training. My diet isn't too perfect, but I do the best I can eating pretty well, but I do intake a lot of fats.  Point is, I made the improvements time ago, but over the course of time, changing exercise types and angles, weight amounts and adjusting decent rest, I often feel tired over a week after resting, and never feel ""fresh"" much. I do go through a lot of stress and anxiety emotionally and have social anxiety disorder. I know stress effects rest and what not, hindering sleep, etc., but is that just reason enough? How do I begin to make improvements, but now older, hardly improving at all over months and months?  My squat's the same, bench has strangely been decreasing rather than increasing, and it's weird.  I keep good rest between sets, go for 5 reps max to only strengthen the myofibrils and CNS as elaborated in many testings, and I will not increase reps because I do not want sarcoplasm fluid increase, I only want strength, but nothing is working and hasn't for months and years....  What could be the real reason I do not make gains, but most other people do? "
178,Hip & ankle flexibility - how to progress?,"I'm currently having problems with the following exercises and activities:   Tucked planche (Priority 1: even getting of the floor is impossible, my legs only tuck if my hips get pulled in by my abs, thus no leeway is produced) Straddle/tucked handstand/headstand pushup V-Sit (can't straighten legs when pointing towards the sky) (Front)-Squats (Leaning to far forward) Skiing - bad posture (standing to stiff, bending to much in hips to compensate) due to little ankle flex Pistol   I never do any stretching or similar stuff, as I always manage full range of motion with all other exercises, however with the things listed above my flexibility is holding me back.  What is the best strategy to improve quickly? Warm up my legs for 10 minutes and then stretch hamstrings and calves? Do some dynamic movements?  Note: For the planche and handstand stuff, I'm also not very good at ""moving my shoulder forward"" and then rotating through thinking about lifting the streched arms upwards (the hands are fixed on the ground, hence the body moved up instead of the arm), so this my partically also be an issue when getting into a tuck.  "
179,"Skinny 141lbs 5'10"" with bad posture and belly pouch",Last month i've noticed how my belly is getting bigger and it's just adding to my body problems.   Is there something i can do to correct/fix my posture and belly at home or is going to the gym inevitable ?  What kind of exercises should I focus on and what not to ? Also I don't count my calories intake but i think i'm slightly underweight even if I eat normally. Thank you all.  
180,Oats a negative aspect for skinny people?,"I am underweight and skinny, I am 5.8 and only 120lbs.  I eat a blended shake of milk, oats and banana. I hear that oats is not good to advantage for people looking on to put some mass.   Is this true? What things could I eat to gain some mass? "
181,diet alternatives,"I'm 24 y.o. male, 173cm, 86kg, currently trying to lose fat and not lose muscles  / means OR  My current diet is   Breakfast (~7.00):   oatmeal / cottage cheese / eggs   (~10.00 - 11.00):   some fruits (apples/pears/tangerines)   Lunch (~14.00):   meat/chicken + rice/buckwheat/potatoes/noodles, sometimes + vegetable salad   Dinner (~19.00-20.00)   varies (vegetable salad + nuts + brown bread / something like lunch but less amount)   I drink 2-3 liters of water daily.  Exercises include pull-ups ( 10 times 10 ) / Parallel bars push-up (12 x 10 ) + some abs exercises, legs exercises once a week.  I'm losing weight, but I suppose(visually) that I'm losing some muscles to.  Does that mean I'm not getting enough protein?  What are some tips on my diet and what are some good alternatives on the meals? "
182,Pre intense soccer game preparation strategies,"I have an intense soccer game coming on this Sunday, it's now Monday in my time and I have around 6 days to prepare for the game. A couple of things about my current situation which I need your advice on how to best get my body ready:   I do jog and the last time I jog was 4 days ago. My last soccer game was 3 weeks ago. That means I'm not in the best condition for the game unless I start some simple training for myself now. There's no game + training from now until that day (Sunday). I'm generally fit.   Now, what I'm trying to do is to best use this 5-6 days period to improve my chance of having a good performance. What would you advice me to do? Which strategies should I use? Any good diet advice?  Thanks in advance. "
183,increasing muscle size / mass and protein intake,"I have a mild chronic kidney disease, through which I have an elevated creatinine level and decreased kidney function.  Due to this, I cannot take good amounts of protein, and need to follow a relatively low-protein diet to decrease the load on the kidneys.  I currently do kick-boxing, and 2 / 3 times a week of circuit resistance training.  Reading on the topic, a lot of forums / information mention quite a good amount of protein per body weight.  Is this absolutely necessary to increase in muscle size?  Is there anything I can do to help, without actually including excessive amounts of protein in my diet?  My main aim is to increase in muscle size / mass, rather than strength, although it would be beneficial if I were to increase both.  In general, I don't think I have a bad shape or form, and already have a good amount of muscle size but would like to increase it .  Another thing of curiosity I would like to ask about is - I read about creatine supplements, which are somewhat related to creatinine level.  I have a naturally high creatinine level due to the mild kidney disease, which hovers in the 130 - 150 range.  Does this have any to do with muscle size?  If some people actually take supplements to increase, could this actually be of any relevance?   "
184,Build leg strength while training for 10 mile run,"Goal and background:  I'm training for a 10 mile (16k) run at the end of July.  My typical runs are 6k and my weekly long run is 8k. I'm trying to run 4x per week. My pace is roughly 6 mins/km — so I tend to do 5k in about 30mins. So I'm not fast, and I have a fair way to go in less than two months.  The issue:  My cardio seems to be doing really well. But my overall strength isn't.  When I find the right pace, I generally feel very good cardio-wise by the end of my runs (even the long 8k runs). But my legs always feel very tired, sometimes to the point of being wobbly. Cardio-wise, I think I could easily run 10-12km now, but my legs would never hold up to that.  The Question:  I have 3 competing needs now:  running, strength training and rest. With less that two months to race day, how can I do enough of each to be ready?  At this stage should I run and rest more? Should I run less and do more strength work? I think I still need 2 rest days per week, so that only leaves 5 days for running and strength work. Should I just keep running and do as many squats as possible everyday? Should I run only hills?  Any suggestions?   Thanks!  Terry  "
185,Will squats help me build stronger legs,"My goal is to make my legs strong and hard. Currently I do 60 Squats daily, and have done so for the last 7 days.  Are squats a healthy/safe/effective way to build stronger leg muscles? Please keep in mind my gender is male. If they are effective, at what timing/frequency will they be most effective for my goal of stronger muscles? "
186,Dull pain/soreness in upper back muscles behind right shoulder bone after pushups,"After pushups I experience a dull pain and soreness in my back muscles behind my right shoulder. I believe its in the rhomboids. The dull pain varies in magnitude and is never completely debilitating. However sometimes it lasts for a day or two. Often the next time I do pushups I experience the same.  Has anyone experienced this or has any idea what I could be doing wrong? A few months ago I used to do 2 sets of 20 pushups but on someones advice, in order to alleviate this, I now do 3 sets of 12. Initially for a few weeks this back soreness seemed to have gone; but then reappeared.  Is there some warmup or stretching that I can do specifically? "
187,How can I convert from one rep range to another?,There are formulas that take how much you can lift at however many reps and convert to a 1 rep max. Are there similar formulas that take the same parameters and calculate how much you can lift at any rep amount?   Or should I just calculate my 1 RM then use %s of it at different rep ranges (for example 10 reps at 75% of my calculated 1RM)? 
188,Short term and long term effect of delaying protein intake after workout,"Today, after a high intensity leg workout, I had to wait 45 minutes before I could take in any food. Usually, I go with a fish/meat dinner, or simply a protein shake.  I was wondering, how does this affect my restitution in the short term? Will my workout have a diminished effect because I didn't take in protein straight after finishing?  Also, what would be the long term effect if I consistently didn't take in protein until an hour (give or take) after finishing a weightlifting workout?  And for perspective, what if I had to wait 4 hours every time?  Specifically, how would my muscles cope with longer periods (consistently) of no protein intake after a heavy workout?  The regular advice is ""protein shake ASAP after workout"", but I'm wondering where this is coming from.   Assume regular dieting beforehand. Nothing protein heavy. Just a bog standard bread breakfast and bread/fruit lunch. "
189,Less fitness for longer and healthier life,"It is entranced into our minds that physical training improves your fitness and health and you live longer and brighter lives. However, it is also known, though less widespread, that taking more calories has opposite effects, e.g. 2011 research      We are able to show that caloric restriction slows down ageing by   preventing an enzyme, peroxiredoxin, from being inactivated. This   enzyme is also extremely important in counteracting damage to our   genetic material,"" says Mikael Molin of the Department of Cell and   Molecular Biology.      By gradually reducing the intake of sugar and proteins, without   reducing vitamins and minerals, researchers have previously shown that   monkeys can live several years longer than expected.   This implies that we should eat less, which implies that we should have less activity (we are not talking about balanced diet rather than burning fats). What am I doing wrong? I cannot understand if I should take more activity and calories or less food and minimal activity.   I see that there is a similar question, Do fit or muscular people age better?. But, it is a bit vague (as answers confirm), and thus did not receive any consideration of the key controversy. I want sharp answer on the sharp question. "
190,Scientific base for the construction of the army and special forces physical training plans,"Recently I took some interest in the military and various armed forces around the world. Ive read some books written by US Marines, SEAL and SAS members. I was very impressed by the training they recieved.  It actually made me wonder - what is the science behind those plans? They seem overly exhausting to me, not leaving enough rest time to allow for muscle regeneration and growth, but those programs still seem to produce, fit warriors. While I am aware that the Hell Week in the SEAL is mostly a psychological test and training, even the regular PT seems really hard, hundreds of pushups, pullups and crunches, and kilometers of running and marching each day.  Could someone make an analysis (or provide a link to one) of a chosen military training program and explain how and why it works so well? One can read about the training plans on various official sites and documents, but Im mainly interested in the more extreme end of the spectrum, like the SEALs physical training regimens. "
191,What is Insulin Amplification?,"I'm going to buy a protein product which features a Insulin Amplification.  But, I'm a little bit worried what Insulin Amplification really is.  So, I'm here to ask the expert: What is actually Insulin Amplification?   Is it safe to use it in daily dose for bodybuilding?  Any help would be greatly appreciated. Thank you "
192,How can I ensure I am working the muscles in each leg equally?,"I have a problem with my knee where it hurts a lot when my leg takes weight (for example, I can do one-legged squats with one leg but not with the other because my knee hurts too much). This knee hurting when the leg takes weight means that the muscles in that leg are a lot smaller than the muscles in the other leg.  When I went to the physiologist for a solution, I was given a set of exercises, including leaning against a wall with my feet 30cm away from the wall, shoulder-width apart, and slowly skidding down the wall until the angle between my shins and thighs is approximately 90 degrees (squats against a wall). One very important thing I was to ensure was that I applied the same amount of force to each leg.  Upon doing this exercise, I realised it was very easy to allow the strong leg to do all the work and neglect the weak leg. After a few days of doing this exercise, I realised that my weak leg was not benefiting from this.  My weak leg is not strong enough to do exercises of this nature by itself, so I can only do exercises that use both legs. How can I ensure that I am working the muscles in each leg equally? I am not looking for diagnosis for my knee or a set of exercises to strengthen my leg, but a way to make sure that my weak leg benefits from the exercises. Note that the exercises do not hurt my knee at all but do not benefit as my strong leg 'takes over'.  tl;dr summary: how can I ensure that I bear the same amount of weight on each leg when doing leg exercises? "
193,Stretching routines for runners,"I've recently started up my long distance running again, and am looking to compete in a marathon early next year. However, I've noticed that specifically my achilles tendon can be quite stiff some mornings. I'ev been quite lax in the past with post-run stretching mostly due to not being sure what or when to do it.  Does anyone have any good stretching routines for runner (specifically distance runners) as well as tips for when do stretch? eg. pre- or post-run or warm-up, stretch, long run, etc...? "
194,"Did tabata training, now my body looks a bit disproportionate","I did tabata intervals religously for 2 months and the results have been great. I did my intervals on an elliptical machine for 4 times a week running for roughly 16minutes to 25minutes a day.   But it looks like ive hit my limit with this tabata exercise. My legs constantly feel tired and exhausted and i now cant continue my tabata exercises. I also feel hungry and tired everyday, constantly.  Another problem is my legs look fit and cut, while my upper body and abdomen is not. I am under the impression that i am on a upper body plateau or something.  Although ive been doing pushups, situps and weight training with my 8lb dumbbells together with my tabata. It doesnt quite show as much in my upperbody   I can feel my abs under the layer of fat but it isnt really coming out.   What upperbody and abdomen exercises can i do to make them show with only an elliptical machine, an exercise mat and two dumbbells weighing at 8lbs each?  And what weight lifting exercise or circuit exercise without weights can i replace my tabata with to even out  y body while losing weight? "
195,"What does ""genetic potential"" really mean? Does it really mean anything?","Often times people devise formulas and objective/subjective viewpoints on how far one can take their progress in fitness and weight lifting/muscle building/strength/etc. I have found that there's no possible way to know how far one can take their body because ... it's not possible to be exact. People say that your size and strength is limited by your genes. What are those limits though?  Look at it this way: If nobody can be 100% sure what someone's genes will allow them to do -- if that even makes sense -- how can someone know there's a real limit? People say you always reach a limit, but does any evidence prove this? Are limits reached or do people stagnate?  Biologically and physiologically speaking, all human cells constantly are regenerating themselves, living and dying 24/7. No evidence shows that there's any reach, measurable limit of human potential with strength and muscle. Years of exercising teaches and forces the body to grow; get stronger; get fitter; and be able to endure more -- even skeletal and ligaments/etc. adapt.  Sometimes the ideal of ""adapt or die"" takes the form of true human potential. One does not know the limit until they're dead. I know it sounds crazy, but can evidence prove there are limits?  Not just something like ""max for this weight class"" or etc. -- those limits just keep getting broken. If someone can keep breaking limits and surprising others, potential is clearly not set in stone -- therefore, is it say to say that there's no real such thing as ""fitness potential"" or the like?  Or even if there was, perhaps your body's genetics can reprogram themselves from forced use? If the human body truly is meant to adapt or die, I can imagine there must be some truth to this, no?  The only true limit is death? If your arm hurts but it still works, keep pushing hard? Never give up? Force yourself? You can do anything? Why believe potential at all? There's no such thing, is there? "
196,"Is having a ""normal"" BMI a healthy target?","I always see BMI charts posted in various health related places, and I know life insurance companies use it for assessing risk.  I've heard the normal range of the index is supposedly based on what normal was in 1800s Poland.  Is this true?  In any case, should a reasonably bulky person using cardio/strength training ever expect to hit that normal range in the normal course of events, or might one expect to stay in the 'overweight' category due to new muscle mass? "
197,What is the efficacy of shock wave therapy in treating plantar fasciitis?,"I have had plantar fasciitis for over a year now, have tried a variety of treatments (e.g. stretching, golf ball rolling, night splint, physical therapy, etc.), and would like to know the efficacy of shock wave therapy. I am aware of some older studies that indicated it was not more effective than sham therapy, but also that therapy might vary depending upon the machine/technique used.  So, my question is this: is extracorporeal shock wave therapy effective for treating plantar fasciitis or similar ailments?  These earlier studies being:   Extracorporeal shock wave therapy for plantar fasciitis. A double blind randomised controlled trial;  Extracorporeal shock wave therapy for plantar fasciitis: randomised controlled multicentre trial;  Ultrasound-Guided Extracorporeal Shock Wave Therapy for Plantar Fasciitis A Randomized Controlled Trial  "
198,"How do gymnasts and dancers remain so slim, yet so agile and strong?","Having a very small percentage of body fat definitely helps, but even so, how is it possible to do backflips etc. being so slim, while people with huge muscles can't even lift off the ground.  What kind of exercise routines do they employ and why do they not gain muscle? Do the existing muscles become stonger? "
199,"What is the correct workout order? (I.e. warm-up, mobility work, lifts, stretches, cooling down)","So here's a couple of things that a workout can consist of:   Warm-up cardio Cooling-down cardio Mobility drills Dynamic stretching Static stretching Fat-burning/endurance training cardio Warm-up sets Weightlifting Did I forget anything?   So what is the correct order to do these things in?  Some stuff I already know:   If doing cardio, do it after lifting. This is because cardio will use stored energy in your muscles that you need for doing strength training. Warm up muscles that are going to be used before heavy lifting (but at what point before? See questions below). One reason for this is so you can feel this muscle better, so you can have a better mind-muscle connection. Divide the lifts from heavy compound exercises to isolation exercises, because you'll need multiple muscles working together in the compound movement, and if one of those muscles is already tired out, they can't do this as well. If doing core work, do it after other lifts. If your core is already tired, your body has more difficulty keeping good form and exerting power.   Some specific questions I have:   Stretching in between sets? Or after a couple of exercises? Or after all your lifting? Warm-up sets of everything before you start any lifting, or just a warm-up set before every exercise? Or both? When to do dynamic and when to do static stretching?  "
200,Excessive caffeine consumption effect on heart/body,"Each day I drink lots of coffee and energy drinks (redbull 355ml cans). I go to gym 3 times a week (on evenings). Are there any effects on my workouts? I stopped drinking any caffeine (at least from coffee and energy drinks) for 3 weeks and didn't feel any changes. Not during daytime nor before, during or after my workouts. My friends often tell me that my heart will explode from such huge amounts of caffeine (I read about caffeine OD and felt ""caffeine induced disorders"" symptoms).  My question is what's the effect of caffeine on heart/body when person is working out? "
201,What are the strengths and weaknesses of shorter bouts of resistance training?,"Currently I am assisting in collecting data for a study on movement patterns and coaching at a small fitness facility.  The nature of my work does not provide consistent time to train, so I find myself participating in 20 to 30 minute sessions.  They look something like the following:   Lower Body Push (today was front squat) 3x8 Upper Body Pull (Bent over dumbbell row) 3x8 Core (Half Kneeling Stability Lift)3x8   Ideally I would have the time for a complementary half, like   Upper Body Push Lower Body Pull Core   But I typically run out of time, and suspect to catch the second half later.  What are the benefits to shorter bouts like this?  What about cons?  Time between sessions is going to look something like 2 to 3 hours.  Should I be emphasizing strength or hypertrophy with splits like this?  Any knowledge is appreciated, if there's any research, please point me in the right direction.  Thanks! "
202,"Can I get sugar and electrolytes from natural sources, as opposed to goo, during a race?","I'm a long distance runner thats not really a fan of all the goo type products.   I'm curious if there are any natural sources of concentrated sugars with the right balance of electrolytes for long distance running? I know that fruits are the most obvious natural sources for these nutrients, but which fruits? Is there a specific mix of fruits? Dried fruits? Should salt be added? Is the high fiber a concern (don't want to have to go to the bathroom during a race)? "
203,Avoid hurting toes during push ups,"I have a disability affecting my legs. For many years I excercised with a bench and weights to get at least some workout. At the moment I can't. So I figured I could at least do some simple things such as push ups, planks and the like. I have little control over my legs and feet, much less toes, so I need a wall to press my feet against.   I am able to do push ups and planks in this manner, but my toes always hurt quite a bit, so I have to stop much earlier than I probably could. I have tried soft shoes that protect my feet and softer surfaces underneath me, but they don't help much. Is this something everyone experiences and overcomes with time, as the toes harden, or does it only happen to me, because my toes are not flexible enough? Do you have any tips? "
204,How do I properly breathe while swimming freestyle?,"While using the freestyle technique of swimming, what is the proper way to breathe?  Is using the nose to breathe out while under better or is there any difference?  Is there a specific number of 'strokes' that should be done before taking a breath?  I've been told to alternate your breathing sides, and to always make them opposite of the arm raised out of the water, is this correct? "
205,What swimming technique is more effective for a cardio workout?,"There are multiple technique out there, with the two I mainly use being breastroke and freestyle.  Is there a difference between the two as far as their effectiveness in a cardio workout?   Is there a technique that stands ""supreme"" for cardio, or is swimming in general just effective? "
206,Natural Running - less injuries or not,"In context of running, one of the most discussed subjects over the last many years probably have been whether ""Natural Running"" will prevent injuries or actually be the source of injuries.  I have looked at the many, many references you can find on the web if you search for ""natural running injuries"" and to me it looks like you can easily confirm any initial views or assumptions no matter what you think of the subject.  With other words, it is extremely difficult to find objective investigation - let alone research - into this subject.  From discussions on my local running team, the general agreement seem to be that natural running is good for your legs in general - especially your shins, knees and hips - but it is bad when it comes to plantar fasciitis. Which kind of make sense to me, as your steps are shorter, but the archs under the feet must handle more pressure.  [As I have almost continuous problems with shin sprints, I wonder if I should try to switch. But I have also had some rather serious problems with PF in the past, which I really, really don't want to repeat..]  Thus the question: Are there any (conclusive) research in this field? Has anybody figured out if natural running is good, bad or just same-same? "
207,Why on Earth do most people enjoy unhealthy food?,"I know some people may argue: ""I actually love eating unsalted tuna with broccoli"", but the sad truth is that most people don't. If I had to choose between a cheese burger with fries and unsalted chicken breast with carrots, I would certainly go for the burger. I bet most people would do the same, at least statistics say so.  My question is: why do our brains prefer unhealthy, fat, food instead of healthier food such as steamed vegetables and some sort of meat?  Are there some evolutionary facts that make us prefer this kind of food? "
208,How can someone new to Yoga improve on their workout?,"Recently I have started Yoga, but I find myself unable to hold any position more than ten seconds.  I was told to exaggerate my posture, but I simply could not.  My flexibility is horrific and feel counter productive even when I follow the Yoga books and routines (books and videos).  It has been two weeks, and I am having hard time improving it.   Is there a modified way to help me get into the basic positions of Yoga before I can at least be effective in beginner Yoga workout? How can I improve? "
209,Should you still exercise when sick?,"Should one continue to exercise even when you are sick?   I know it may depend on the sickness, so I am specifically asking about minor things like a cold or fever?   Are there chronic sicknesses where you should still regularly exercise? "
210,Can drinking too much water lead to looking bloated?,"I drink a lot of water. Easily 4 liters pure liquid on normal days, 5+ when exercising (5 days a week).  I heard as a child, that salt and water are stored and produce compartments similar to fat.  Is that really true? Is there such a thing as water weight and could I reduce my body size, by cutting back my water intake to 2 liters of liquid a day? "
211,"Lost swimming cardio, replacement with jogging","I am not a fitness fanatic but like to maintain general health and condition by doing 30+ minutes of cardio and 30+ minutes of strength training each day.  I used to swim every day for 30-35 minutes each morning before breakfast, which worked great since it is hard to overload or injure yourself that way and it was very refreshing.  Now I cannot swim anymore (pool closed) so I am looking for a suitable simple alternative for a daily refreshing cardio.  Can it be replaced by just going for a 30-35min jog every day? What would a good pace be? At the moment, I'm doing it everyday and do around 6.5-7km if my Vivosmart HR is to be believed.  So, what do you think? Is this a good way to approach the loss of swimming? One of the downsides is that one of my strength days also focuses on legs, which makes the jogging a bit more difficult. "
212,Mixing weight training and cardio/strength,"I do several times a week strength and cardio training (Thai boxing, to be specific), but also try to mix in extra weight sessions to build up muscle mass.  Is it good or bad to mix these two? I've heard contradictory opinions, none backed by evidence. Which of the following is more ""correct""?   Workout every day, alternate the type of training (time sink, recovery is tricky, injuries heal slower). Do both in the same session (is it too much load for one session? which one should go first?). You can't have it all, it's a tradeoff: stick to either one or the other.  "
213,Should I stretch after exercise?,Are there benefits with stretching right after exercising? Does stretching afterwards affect the risk of injury? 
214,What are exercises you can do on a bus?,"I'm going to leave on a bus tour of Europe soon. I figure that all this time on a bus isn't going to be good for me, so I was wondering if there is any exercise I could do on the bus. For example, I've heard you can buy these things you can squeeze that will improve your grip strength (don't know what their proper name is). I'm curious if there is anything else that would work well in the confined space of a bus?  Update: I changed the title back to ""What are exercises you can do on a bus?"" as I think buses are a special case of space confinement and need to be treated separately. "
215,What products are available that attach to existing fitness machines (weights/treadmills/cardio etc) to track usage?,"We are trying to find an off the shelf system that we can attach to existing fitness machines in a gym that tracks machine usage on a user basis. So the idea would be to attach them to all machines and provide all users with a login of some form (PIN number/RF tag etc) and then it can automatically track their usage and ideally provide real time feedback as relevant.  I understand there are quite a few companies who make their own fitness machines where this is possible. However we need to retrofit this to existing machines so wanted to see if anyone knew of any companies that offer this?  The only one we can currently find it FitLinxx ([website]Thanks,  Dave "
216,Why rest between sets?,"Why is it common to rest between sets of repetition? Could I, instead of resting, exercise another muscle group? "
217,Workout Intensity vs. duration,I came across an article that said      'If you don't finish your workout in around an hour it's probably not that intense'.   How far is this true ? (Workout here refers to just the strength training not cardio)  Also does that mean I should be so sore/tired by the end of one hour that I shouldn't be able to do anything beyond that.?    If the answer to both the above questions is no is there any relation between the intensity and duration of a workout routine ?   Thanks in advance. 
218,Capsicum: Simply burn more calories? Does it even work?,I'm looking for some kind of low cost supplement to help me shed some pounds.  I'm about 260lb right now.. at 5ft 10.5in.  I have been working out regularly.. trying to keep a strict diet (work on making some changes) and I figured I would look at other options.  I read online that Capsicum tablets can heat the body up and burn fat cells.  Does it just burn up more calories or does it target the fat cells in particular?  Lastly.. does it even really work?  I've looked around online but I haven't been able to find any real facts on it. 
219,Progressing while losing weight on a low carb diet?,"I am trying to lose weight and at the same time build strength. I am 6'2"" and 33 years old. I started out at 258 lb about 5 months ago. Now I am at 205 lb, mostly due to switching to a modified Keto diet (bit less fat and a bit more protein). A healthy weight for my body type would be around 190 lb as I am right now, 200 lb with some muscle. I mostly have been doing calisthenics, but I am just not progressing very much at all. Still after about 3 months of trying I can only do one pullup and about 6 pushups. Not really progressing in other areas as well.  It feels like I am working hard, but I am just not really see any real progress. I want to train for strength rather than hypertrophy, but at this point I would take any progress.  Am I not progressing because I am not eating enough? I generally love my current diet and don't feel hungry usually. Should I just weight until I hit my 190 lb goal and then eat more and try to build muscle. Is there a good way for me to build muscle and more importantly strength while continuing to lose weight?  Any suggestions? Thanks! "
220,Multiple short workouts vs one long session,"I'm a 20-year-old male, and it's been a while since I've done anything physical, so I'm trying to build some muscle. However, I'm a full time student and I work 20 hours a week, which doesn't leave me with much time to hit the gym.  Now, this coming term I have lots of short breaks between my classes, around 30-45 minutes each. I could potentially take about 20-30 minutes of every break to hit the gym. My question is: Are multiple shorter workouts every day more or less effective than one long workout? What are the practical implications of doing this? I realize 20-30 minutes isn't a lot of time, but I'd be doing this around 3 times a day.  I apologize if this question is too vague; I can specify anything as needed. "
221,Hack for fixed dumbbells,"I've found different ways to add smaller increments to certain equipment in our gym. For example, for cables (where each plate weighs 15 lbs), I place a 5 lb or 10lb dumbbell above the first plate. For fixed barbells, I tape a dumbbell in the middle of the bar with a kind of stretchable band with velcro.  The dumbbells in our gym have fixed weights at 5 lbs increments from 10 lbs to 30 lbs, and 10 lb increments for heavier dumbbells. Is there a way to add just 2.5 lbs or 5 lbs? I'm thinking about something which can be worn in the hands (weighted gloves?), wrist or forearms, and I don't know if there is even such a thing. "
222,Does the amount of breathing (holding breath/breathing fast) affect the calories burned during a workout (not heavylifting)?,"Why I even think it could have any effect: maybe when the body has deficit of the oxygen, the burning reaction modifies to burn more sugar/fat/whatever (i.e. instead of burning each molecule completely it is burning them just up to a certain point and go over to the next)? (have heard something like that but would like to have some solid facts :) If there is any difference, how much is it, is it worth to think about during workouts? "
223,Is this too much Protein?,"I am tall 192cm (6'4"") and I weigh 100kg  I use Protein shake after gym around 30gm of Protein and because I go to gym late night, immediately after gym i eat 2 cans of Tuna ( around 15gm Protein each) then drink Milk then go to bed. In the morning I eat a sandwich and light lunch at work and eat a medium meal around 6 pm  is this too much Protein for me? shall I stop the night tuna because I already had the Protein shake? "
224,Warming up calf muscles for general work out session,"I'm at the gym 2-3 times per week and run a standard set of machines (full body work out) to stay healthy and (hopefully) tune my body a bit.  One of the machines for training the legs always causes my calf muscles to strain and cramp up. When I started working out a couple of months ago my instructor told me to use the cross trainer machine for 10 minutes as warm up. I like it, get warm and probably burn some fat but It doesn't seem to warm up my calf muscles enough.  Are there any exercises for warming up the calf muscles I can add to the cross trainer to avoid the strain/cramp when using the leg machines? I stretch my calf muscles after the work out session and I can really feel them strain. I can usually hold the stretch for 60 seconds without feeling any sense of relief in the calf, so I guess they are pretty strained. Is it OK to stretch muscles when not warmed up? (same exercises as after work out, but before?) Mostly my left calf cramp up, almost never the right one.  I also occassionally wake up when sleeping because of sudden strain/cramp in my calves, though I do believe this has gotten a little bit better since I started working out.  Here is the machine/exercise, but I am lying straight on the bench, not angled:   Edit: If I lower the weight one step I can perform the exercise without cramping. But then I manage 15-20 reps and I feel that is too light weight, so I increase the weight one step and cramp up.  Update  Progress, at last. This evening I managed eight reps and stopped only because I was exhausted, not because of cramp!  I can't point to a single thing that helped - probably a combination of the preparations I made during the day and warm up (mostly suggestions from you guys):   I've been drinking alot of water today (maybe a bit too much). Warming up before exercise I ran 10 minutes on treadmill instead of crosstrainer, at 4% incline. This, I think, made a big difference. As early as 2-3 minutes into it I could feel the calves stretching out and smoothen up. Crosstrainer is great, but running warms up the calves better. I also did some ""toe pushups"", 1 minute or so on each foot, to further warm up the calves before the hamstring curl machine.   Hopefully It'll work next time as well. Thanks for all great suggestions! "
225,What time frame might I expect to correct arm rotation?,"My arms are rotated so that the back of my hands face directly forward.  This is presumably from years and years of sitting at a computer.  I am attempting to correct it by doing only pull exercises: bent-over rows and deadlifts, as well as stretches for pec minor and the various back and shoulder muscles.  Additionally, I am doing wall slides.  My question is, assuming this routine will correct the muscle imbalances that have led to my arm rotation, what approximate time frame might I expect the correction to occur by?  E.g. on the order of weeks?  Months? "
226,Cleaning your body of Creatine and Amino Acids,How many days does the body need to get rid of all Creatine and Amino Acids?  Is not using any Creatine and Amino Acids for a week is enough to clean Liver and Kidney of these supplements? If not then how long needed? 
227,Reducing wrist pain/weakness during exercising,"I'm spending most of the day in front of the computer (10+ hours), and as expected, my wrist tendons experience strain during work. Normally, this wouldn't be much of an issue, but after I have started training more aggressively (especially with free weights), I feel slight pain and weakness in the wrists when they are at unnatural position under load.   The frequency of training is not the issue -- usually at most 3 times per week, and I do torso/arms exercises only twice per week.  Now, the questions:   Which arm exercises are known to put less strain on the wrists? I'm interested in upper-arm/chest exercises mostly, but advice for other muscle groups is appreciated as well. Is there something else I can do to reduce the problem (training accessories, special exercises, other)?   Currently I'm doing exercise on the weight machines and cables mostly, some free weights and stretching. No push ups whatsoever. "
228,Pre-workout - static vs dynamic stretches,"While checking out some workout videos, I can across one from Jillian Micheals where she says, ""you never want to do static stretches until after the workout is over and you're doing cool down"".  Why does she say this? What is the problem with doing static stretches pre-workout vs dynamic stretches? "
229,What are the recommended exercise types for getting broad shoulders?,"What exercises do you recommend, if one's main target is broad shoulders (and chest too, but less priority)? Does reducing exercises for other muscle group help? Any other tips? "
230,"Side effects of doing half of a ""doubled"" workout","The P90X chest and back workout consists of a set of exercises which are done in two sets... do each exercise (pushups, pullups, rows, etc) for X seconds (varies for each exercise), and then repeat the whole thing again. It takes about an hour to complete.  I don't have a full hour to devote to the program, but I will be able to do just the ""first half"" each night. I remember reading that 80% of the muscle mass gain is acquired from the first set, and that repeated sets are mostly done to improve tone. So, my questions are:   Is this true? Based on the answer to the first question, is it worth it to complete only half the prescribed regimen?  "
231,Should I take days off from working out - regardless of what my workout schedule is?,"I'm currently working out where I alternate between cardio and weightlifting, and on my weightlifting days I alternate the body parts I target.  Doing this I work out everyday, the idea being since I'm working out different body parts on different days I'm giving each area the rest it needs.  I'm doing this because I find a habbit is easier to keep if its something that is manageable and done daily as opposed to weird rules (ie rest every 3rd day, or on weekends, etc).  Is there any problem with this?  It seems like the reasons for taking a day off is to give the muscles time to heal, but if I'm working different muscles each day is it ok to work out each day? "
232,Are all extra calories stored as fat or is there a limit?,Suppose that one day I ate really a lot of sugar and junk food. So I made a high surplus of calories. Are all of those extra calories going to be stored as fat? Or does the body have a limit for that? 
233,Which protein shake I should take as a beginner?,"I have been going to the gym for the last four months, previously I went three times a wekk but right now I am going 1/2 of the days in a week.  But I am not gaining muscle but I can lift more weight than in the past.  It seems that I have to take some supplements. Can you guys mention some of the names of GNC or other protein supplements name? How to eat them?  My target is to gain mass. I am now 24, 5'8"" and 59KG weight.  I have to buy it from Amazon (my country doesn't have any GNC store) and ship it to me. How much vat is generally added on supplements?  Thanks in advance.  "
234,Is it possible for muscles to shrink after a workout?,I've just started a HIIT training routine and after two workouts my arms (triceps &amp; biceps) grew 1/4 inch.  I went to the gym this morning and after I got home 12 hours later measured my arms and they'd shrunk by 1/8th of an inch.    I know that muscles grow when I rest and sleep.  But will the gain return in the morning?  And is the shrinkage a sign of possible over training?  I haven't trained to failure in any of my muscle groups in the last week. 
235,Knee pain when squatting,"I have mild knee pain in my left knee only whenever I have a small break in form when doing any squat type exercise (ie, my knee goes past my toes when my feet are flat on the floor). When in proper form, the knee is pain free and this does not happen to my right knee at all, regardless of form. I have no pain in the knee when not exercising (ie standing, going up stairs, etc) but am worried that I may be setting the ground work for a future knee injury. I wish I could always have perfect form but this isn't possible, say, on the last 2 reps of my last heavy set. I keep proper form >90% of the time. Once the pain hits and I correct my form, it goes away. Also, I cannot take ibuprofen b/c of a reoccurring stomach issue. Should I be concerned? Since it is in one knee only will it continue to get worst or will exercise strengthen the joint? Should I be doing other exercises to strengthen my knee or go see a doctor? I squat once a week and do jumping exercises ones a week. I also deadlift ones a week so 3 days a week I have this issue.  "
236,What movements are safe to 'do for time'?,"Rookie here. Been studying and trying different things. I like trying to do ""x number of move x in some amount of time"". Some movements like Olympic weightlifting, should obviously not be done for time as the risk of injury is too great.   My question is what movements can be done for time? The short list I have come up with is:   running pushups   pullups  jumping jacks   burpees could be included but perhaps shouldn't be due to risk of knee or back injury?  I searched this site and googled, but couldn't find anything. Thanks! "
237,What exercise routine can I do at home to get a sixpack?,"I am interested in gaining more definition in my stomach and chest area. I suppose I would like to work towards having a well defined sixpack, although that is not as important to me as gaining some more definition in general.  I'm generally considered skinny at just over 6 feet (183cm) in height and 175 lbs(~70kg) give or take. I'm not overweight at all, yet I also don't seem to have any definition.  What exercises can I start doing each day to improve this and for how long?   In what amount of time would I start to see results? "
238,Fat and protein breakdown,"I know that after depletion of glycogen body starts to use fat for fuel. If I continue working an hour or more in this state, does my body start to use proteins for energy after a while? I have some belly fat so I don't think I am losing proteins from my muscles? Am I right? "
239,What exercises are good to build up to performing chin-ups?,"I can't do a single decent chin-up, are there any easy alternatives that I could build up in quantity as a forerunner to being able to do chin-ups?  Alternatively are there are any weights exercises that could help achieve this?  Are there any online resources that outline a program for beginners to learn chin-ups and increase the number? Maybe something similar to hundredpushups.com that I can follow daily (I know they are working on a program called 25 pullups). "
240,Is it really important to restrict the workout to 45 minutes?,"It is been said everywhere that any strength/muscle gain workout should be restricted to 45 minutes, due to hormone levels decay after that time. Many say that you are even supposed to cause loss of muscle mass if you keep on training beyond that time limit.  I try my best, but my workouts (very similar to StrongLifts/Starting Strength) take 60~70 minutes minimum. I end nearly exhausted and trembling (which is OK, I don't have any problem with that).  But, should I cut the number of sets, or? I want to gain strength and muscle mass. Is it really important to restrict the workout to 45 min? When you have a look at the workouts that are supposed to be followed by high-level bodybuilders, it is clearly impossible that they do that in 45 minutes. "
241,How can I stop sweaty hands?,"Sweaty hands are plaguing my rock climbing and pull up exercises, as well as being annoying at other times. I've read a few (unsourced) ideas that nutrition can be a big factor in sweaty hands. Can I do to stop sweaty palms by changing my diet? If so, how? "
242,Does fat make you fat?,"I understand that there are good and bad fats. I'm talking about the good ones, the fat that comes from avocado, flax seed oil, etc.   I am obese at the moment and wish to lose body fat quickly. I am eating a diet that is giving me a caloric deficit, it's composed of low glycemic complex carbs, proteins and dairy and no fat. Should I add a fat source to my diet?  I understand that eventually a healthy diet must have a fat source but given my situation as an obese person looking to lose weight quickly, should I add a good fat to my diet now or wait a while until I lose some weight first?  The bigger question is, do good fats actually get stored as fat in the body (if one's lifestyle isn't very active) or do they serve some other purpose? "
243,Women's fitness plan for weight (muscle?) gain,"I searched on the internet for some women fitness plans for my girlfriend, a but lot of them are to lose weight. But she is slim, and I wanted some training for weight gain, and to strengthen her body.  Do you thing that I should look for some specific plans for the beginner (as she is)? Is it enough to start with any beginner plan for women? Or should I recommend an aerobic plan instead of the gym? "
244,Protein of red and white meat,Is there a difference between the protein found in red meat (like beef and ostrich) and white meat (like chicken and pork) and protein from fish and should you aim to get these in in any particular ratio to one another? Or could protein intake coming mostly from just one of these types be sufficient? 
245,Does eating late at night cause weight gain?,"I like to keep a latish schedule, sleeping often around 2-3 AM, I'm often eating odds and ends late at night.  If someone eats Meals A, B &amp; C of certain calorie content, and then timeshifts his schedule so that he's eating the same meals later at night, and closer to when he's about to sleep, will he gain ""excess"" weight? If so, why? "
246,What is the purpose of 'cooling down'?,"After a hard work out, it's generally a good idea to not stop immediately, but rather to cool down.  What is the specific purpose of cooling down?  Does not properly cooling down affect the actual efficiency of the work out itself? "
247,"What is empirically considered ""dangerous low caloric intake"" these days?","I've lost a fair amount of weight over the past few years.  During this experience, I've always kept anorexia/bulimia in the back of my mind to avoid falling into any dangerous habits.  That being said, is there an empirically accepted minimum on when cutting caloric intake crosses over from ""cutting calories"" to anorexia?  I am around 220 right now and I'd like to make it down to 180/190 (I'm 5 11 male and usually work out 4 times/week even though I could work out up to 7 days depending on my routine).  I've been on all sorts of diets and have adjusted to what works best over time.  Since the last weight is so much harder to burn off, I'm resorting to cutting calories.  I remember reading an article few years ago (maybe a wikipedia page or something) that 1200-1400 calories for a guy like me was considered extreme.  Now I'm finding things like this:  [website]While I realize I could be taking this out of context, it is still by the US Dept of Health and Human Services (so while it may not be the best source on the planet, I assume at least some medical professional has vetted this).  So now that all of that context is there, I can ask my question:  What is empirically considered ""dangerous low caloric intake"" these days?  At what level of caloric intake would a doctor say ""This is dangerous, you MUST eat more regardless of your weight loss situation""?  As in, when would I cross the line from losing weight to anorexia.  Is it even possible to be considered anorexic if I'm still overweight? "
248,Combining weight-lifting (starting strength) with rockclimbing?,"I've been following the Starting Strength program for a few weeks now, on and off. Unfortunately, I haven't been as regular as I'd like (lets chalk it up to student life), but I feel I'm making progress and am committed to sticking with the program. I've been increasing my weight somewhat conservatively, because I keep missing workouts and because I don't have anyone to teach me the lifts, so I've been trying to perfect the technique as much as I can before going up. So, ATM, squat 75, deadlift 70 (yes, I'm afraid of my back), press 35, bench press 50. Because I don't feel very comfortable doing deadlifts, I've opted for the ""Practical Programming Novice workout"" which has chins/pulls twice a week and deadlifts just once; power cleans are out of the question, both because I don't have anyone to teach me and because my gym isn't exactly setup for it.  Now, I also want to start rock climbing, perhaps once a week. I had a session last weekend (and went to the gym the next day without major problems), but I'll probably start going regularly in about two weeks or so. My question is, where should I put the rock climbing session in my week? My first thought was to put it at the ""end"" of the week, when I have two rest days. Please also take into account that my workout week is erratic.  Bonus question, is there anything I should do in the intervening two weeks to help me with my rock climbing later? I could conceivably do more deadlifts (to help with my grip and pull) and then later back them down to 1x a week; would that be useful? "
249,What should I eat before/after a workout?,"I go to gym almost all days. For every workout I use to weight train one muscular zone and run  about 50 minutes (at low rates, about 130/140 bpm). My target is to burn as most fat as I can (I'm male, so my fat is particularly on belly). Sometimes if I haven't time, I prefear running session (always at low rates, and always about 50 minutes) to the weight train. I'm 28 and my body is athletic, and I always do some sports in my life. The question is:  What should I eat before the workout? What should I eat if i'm going to just run? What should I eat if i'm going to make both weight train and running session? How much time before the workout? Is weight train on empty stomach unuseful or at worse bad for muscles?  Best Regards "
250,How can you recover from a very terrible metabolism damage from the past?,"I'll start this question with a small story so you all know how to answer this question right.  When I was a kid I was extremely picky, I refused to eat alot of things for very vague reasons, such as meat and veggies. My whole metabolism revolved around junk food in general. I was always underweighted (Terribly underweighted) and I still am. In that time I was eating randomly, I mostly didn't eat breakfast, and the other meals I would eat at random times.  Since last year I've taken serious attitude towards this and I've started by adding proper meals at proper times: Breakfast, lunch and dinner. I'm not as picky now, I eat lots more things despite there are things I still don't like. I am underweight, and from a previous question, I mentioned I'm 50 kgs at 1.85m.  This whole recovery plan has worked out terribly slow for the last year, I've gained 2 kilos in the past 3 years, and as I gain a kilo I drop it the next day. I should mention I'm a student and my calory burn is extremely high.   The real question here is how do I recover properly from such strong damage on the metabolism? I am eating like a normal person now, and I have all my meals set up properly now, however I am seeing little no to result. Every step forward comes with 2 steps back. Would it be possible for a faster recovery, or will I have to wait years just to get on the right track? "
251,Walking my way to FATness?,"I started walking 3 miles per day around October of 2015, before 2015 I did swimmimg , biking, treadmill, crosstraining and adding weights to my ankles and all sorts of things to shift weight.   I am still walking 3 miles per day. Since I started I have lost very little in weight and I dont eat much already. I am not a cake, chocolate, crisp (Potato chips), fizzy drinks or junk food addict. I was raised on vegetables, meat, fruit, juice, and occasional biscuits (cookies) for a treat and I honestly mean occasional. I dont drink alcohol except on a rare social event in the family which is truly rare and then I'll only drink to tipsy merry no more.   I gave up smoking 6 years ago this year, yet I have battled with my weight all my bloody life and I'm quite sick of making an effort for no true results. Some times my thyroid doesnt work correctly, doctor says my brain is not calling for the thyroid to work like it should. I also have an iron deficiency, I cant hold on to iron as it doesnt absorb, it leaves my body and so i have to take iron in tablet form and I am now 15st,13 and 3/4 in weight (About 206 lbs), I was 16 st 13.   Even though I have been walking since Oct 2015, my legs still burn badly when walking and I'm breathless when there is an incline in the pavement!   What's my issue why cant I shed weight like others I see exercising by walking? Why does it still hurt too? "
252,Does shortening stride length (and running for a longer time) require the same effort as a longer stride (for a shorter time)?,"I'm currently training for a 10k with my girlfriend: the goal is to complete the race without stopping rather than any specific time. However, I'm a foot taller than she is so when we do runs, I shorten my stride quite a bit so we maintain the same tempo.  It seems to me that running 5km @ 6 minutes/km by myself vs. 7 minutes/km with her still feels like the same amount of effort by the end. Shorter strides + longer time vs. Longer strides + shorter time.  Am I imagining things? Should one of these scenarios be more work/effort, or do they equal out in the end? "
253,How do I overcome this muscle / knee pain?,"I'm a 24 year old software engineer that basically sits at a desk all day. Obviously, this isn't a healthy lifestyle, so I decided to start running in order to get in shape. I'm not an athlete by any means, but I'm not fat...yet (I'm 5' 11"" and weigh about 190).  Since I'm a noob when it comes to exercising, I decided to look online for some advice. I found the Beginner's Guide to Running and decided to take its advice. I hope that was wise.  Three weeks ago, I started running 3 days a week, for 30 minutes each of those days. For the first 10 minutes of each running session, I warmed up by walking. On the first week, I jogged for 1 minute and walked for 1 minute. I repeated this pattern for 10 minutes (I felt like an idiot in the gym, but I did it nonetheless), and then walked for 10 minutes to cool down.  The next week, I increased the jogging/walking intervals to 2 minutes, like the article mentioned. I felt like I was making pretty good progress.  By the end of the first day of the next/third week, my knees were hurting fairly bad. And, since they were still hurting throughout the rest of the week, I decided to rest for the remainder of that week.  I'm now on the fourth week of ""running."" Since my knees were feeling much better (probably not 100% healed), I decided to go run yesterday. This week, I wanted to increase my interval time to 2:30m jogging / 2m walking. However, after my first interval jogging, the knee pain came back with a vengeance. Also, my shin muscles hurt very bad and were very tight by the end of the session (they usually do get sore, but not this bad, this quick). So, instead of continuing the jogging intervals, I simply walked the remainder of the 30 minutes.  I need some advice on actions to take from here. I want to get in better shape, but my shins/knees seem like they just can't keep up right now.  Are there specific/better steps that I need to take in order to work up to what I'm wanting to do? Or, do I just need to grow some bigger balls and power through it?  Also, I figure my knees will heal with time (I hope), but my shin muscles being sore (not just tired, but they get very tight and sore) seems to be a more consistent issue. Is this due to me simply being out of shape, or do I need treatment in other ways? "
254,"Is working on the same set of muscles in a day a sound advice for muscle building, what is the scientific reasoning behind it?","My gymmates told me that if I want to build my muscles, I should concentrate on one part of muscles ( eg: biceps) in one day, then move on to the next part of the muscles the other day. Never ever workout on two or more different parts of muscles on the same day because the muscles won't be built up that way.  I don't find this a compelling argument because if you keep on working out on a part of the muscles, it will experience fatigue and hence the benefit will be diminishing. Won't it be better to train on different part of muscles so that resting time is properly given to the tired muscles?  Who's right on this? What is the proper workout routines as far as muscle building is concerned? "
255,Using a resistance band to work the upper back -- not working,"I want to work my upper back to help fix my hunched ""computer posture"" shoulders.  I'm sitting with my legs extended, wrapping the band around my feet, and pulling the handles of the band to my torso.  I did 65 reps yesterday, some with my elbows bending downward, some with them bending out.  Today, I'm not sore!  What gives?  Is there a more efficient exercise for this? "
256,Failure to do 16 pushups,"I'm sporting moderately for about half of a year, dropped lots of weight and got some muscle. The only problem there is, is with pushup repetitions.   Previous summer I was doing 10-15 normal pushup reps. Next, I strarted doing them with ""handles"" (or whatever they are called, for deeper pushups). And I still could do only 10-15 of them. Then I trained myself enough to do 10-15 diamond pushups in one set.   Everything seems pretty nice, right? However, when I now try doing ""basic"" pushups, they seem to be horribly easy for me at first, but I still can't do more than 15 of them! My arms do not hurt, my chest does not hurt, I just feel horribly tired after doing 15 of them and just collapse on the ground trying to do 16-th. It's like my hands can't handle more than 15 reps   Some of my friends told me that I need to drink more water. Well, last month I've been drinking 4-5 litres per day. The other one told me to try Creatine - with same result.  What can be the problem? I don't think that is linked with lungs and oxygen consumption, as I can run 8km at 10 km/h with no breathing problems. Maybe I need some special training program?  Thanks in advance.  Information about my training:  I'm following one of training programs described in book Convict Conditioning. Basically I'm training every day with Sunday as an off-day. Program targets different muscle group every day, 2 times a week. So basically I'm doing pushups 2 times a week (tuesdays and thursdays).   Usual pushup session looks like this:   2 sets (15 reps) wide hands with handles 2 sets (10-15 reps) diamond pushups 2 sets (5-10 reps each arm) of 1 arm + 1 arm with handle (training with aim for one-armed pushups).   The whole program goes like this:   Mondays: Pullups, Situps, Grip Work (hanging) Tuesdays: Pushups, Leg-raises, Calf Work Wednesday: Hand-stands, Bridges, Neck-work (bridge-like) See Mondays. See Tuesdays. See Wednesday. Day off + some light stretching over the day.   Also, I think it's worth mentioning that I get 8 hours of sleep, and 100-150g of protein per day (+multivitamins +potassium +magnesium +fish-oil). Moreover, no smoking, no alcohol and healthy food only. "
257,What is the best routine during times of sleep deprivation?,"There have been several questions about sleep deprivation asked here. The general response seems to be ""don't do it"". This seems to be what google says too.  However, I have a baby coming to my house soon. This coupled with a full time job and a part time programming addiction is going to restrict the amount of sleep I will be able to get. So I need to prepare myself to cope as much as possible.  My main goals at this time will be mental alertness and vitality. I am assuming weight training will be off the cards. It also makes sense to me to lay off the heavy carbs and obviously steaks etc.. . Am I right?  How much cardiovascular training should I be doing? What intensity?  Are there other exercises that may help?  Are there ideal sleep patterns to try to follow? I've heard conflicting reports about the benefits of a 20 minute nap..  What kind of diet should I try to follow? Are there any supplements that may help? "
258,Where can I try minimalist running shoes?, What actual physical stores carry them? Is there anywhere online that I could buy then return without problems if they didn't fit my foot? I have heard Zappos is good about it.  
259,Pros and Cons of the Tunturi R25 Magnetic Rowing Machine,"I bought a new tunturi R25 rowing machine to replace one I had for years of the same make.  The new one is a magnetic rower, while the old one is a piston. here is the new one.   I got it and put it all together and I have three problems with it.   One - it may be thinner than my old one, but it's much chunkier. I used to stand the old one up and hide it behind a cupboard. This one does fold, but it's still quite big.  Two - I can't come as far forward on the new one as I could on the old one, on the old one I used to hunch up all the way to the front, this one I have to limit my motion a bit, although it's fine going back.  Three - The old one allowed you to set the clamp on the piston arms so that the resistance made it almost impossible to row. On the new one I'm already on the highest resistance setting and it's not very hard. It's OK, but no room for improvement. One thing I liked about the old rower was that as well as being good cardio, all these muscles started appearing on my back, so I kept turning up the resistance which was good until it broke...  Are these problems worth sending the thing back for? Or do they not matter?  and if they are legit problems, what's the alternative? All the piston ones are really cheap and people say they break, but the alternatives are huge! i don't want a giant piece of equipment in my house! "
260,"What is the best time for ""me"" to exercise?","Some people have argued that morning is the best time to hit the gym but for me personally this has not worked out. I am not a morning person, when I get up I am usually hungry and after breakfast I do not think I can hit the gym right away. I seem to have better energy before the lunch time but that is office time so cant go to the gym during those hours.  After lunch the energy goes down and in the evening I am very tired after the long commute. I am really trying to figure out best routine but nothing seems to be working.  Anyone in similar situation? How did you figure out your routine?  EDIT: This is for weight training only, I am not trying to loose weight but gain some. "
261,Does heat cream benefit the regeneration?,"I've been sick for the last two weeks and my doctor told me to get Finalgon, which is a heat cream. (Note: Finalgon is not only reacting with the skin, like some sticking plasters)  While I really liked the effect and it really benefited my curing, it felt like it was stimulating my blood circulation.  This made me curious, if there is any benefit using heat cream when it comes to regenerating from aching and sore muscles?  I do not want to question the effectiveness of heat creams in general, but if there is any value using it when trying to regenerate faster from hard workouts (which in my case is bodybuilding)? Maybe because of its stimulating effect?  I came up with this, as I regularly read about blood circulation aiding supplements and foods. "
262,TDEE has increased?,Is it normal for a person's TDEE to increase during cold weather? This week has been brutally cold over here and I have noticed that even though I am eating more calories I am losing weight (fat and muscle). Why is this? 
263,Does heavy lifting affect steadiness and precision?,"I do a fair amount of weightlifting; in particular heavy compound lifts power-lifting style. I also compete on a target pistol team. Over the years, I've heard a number of coaches and marksmen recommend that serious shooters stay away from heavy lifting because it could affect arm stability/precision when holding the pistol.  The physical requirement for this sport is to be able to hold a 2 lb pistol (with one hand/arm only) at arm's length with elbow locked as steady as possible for 5-10 secs.  So my question: are these two sports at odds? Can someone give an explanation for why heavy lifting might (or might not) compromise my ability to hold the pistol as steady as I could if I didn't lift?  "
264,Doing HIIT everyday and 3 day workout routine per week in the gym is good for my health?,I do 20 minutes of minutes and then 20 minutes of stretching every morning. I go gym for 3 day per gym. As i am a skinny fat guy. I want to remove my belly fat while growing muscle. So this is what i do per week.  Is this good for my health? Or is it good if i continue this routine for 1 year or may be more? 
265,Chest/Abs training for a thin young man (4 times for 6 months),"I need your advice. I'm a thin guy who spends most of his time sitting (SW developer). I'm between thin and fit, and I want to get this fit. Basically, abs and chest.  My body:   Age: 26 Height: 1.79m (5' 10.5'') Weight: 60kg (133lbs) Strong legs, weak arms   Last summer I tried calisthenics by myself, following this training, 2 times a week + running 6.5km in 45 minutes. I did it during 7 months with several interruptions. I lost 2kg and achieved my lowest weight ever and my fittest view ever, photo here. However, for me 59,5kg is borderline ""below ideal weight"" according to BMI.  My diet:   I eat 5 times a day (breakfast, brunch, lunch, linner, dinner) and drink less than &lt;200ml of water No red meat, usually white meat (4 times a week), sometimes fish Always vegetables (broccoli once per week), always carbs (rice > pasta > bread > potatoes), almost no sugar, low fats (cheese, milk, yogurt)   I feel like I'm not being effective with my training. I can feel my abs below my belly fat, but I can't lose any more fat! This spring I want to start it again, but with your guidance. I can train 4 times a week.  Question:  Which exercises do you recommend for my goal (chest, abs)? It's hard to train chest with shaky arms (&lt;20 push-ups straight). Any changes on my diet? It looks wrong to eat chicken and broccoli every day.  P.S: I don't want to get bigger, I just want to look fitter (dry body). "
266,How would it possible to do Hammer Curls on Gymnastic Rings?,"I googled around but did not find any clear ways except for this one quote from 2012 where its not clear how that was being done/ practiced.   Any thoughts/ ideas on how this can be done?    Because the only way I can think of holding the rings when Curling is Parallel the body plane. How could one hold and do Hammer Curls with Rings?       Re: Ross, bicep curls? Post by ExplosiveStrength85 » Tue Jul 03, 2012 11:52 am  Hey guys curls have their place when needed but I would highly recommend bicep curls on gymnastic rings. Regular bicep curls don't really do too much for that top portion of lift. By using rings it reverses the role of regular curls and focuses on that top end strength. You will develop the bicep to higher degree and they are really good for developing that close end locking strength. I do regular, reverse, and hammer curls on rings and they will build ridiculous strength for anyone involved in grappling or arm wrestling. I do these along with heavy chins all variations. All gymnasts use the ring curls but they also do some regular curls for that lower end strength. Every exercise has its place somewhere.  "
267,What are the most up to date consolidated daily health maintenance measures?,"Title could be enough. But since this question is so simple that it looks a bit absurd or obvious...  Unlike many questions out there in this site, I'm looking for fitness (rest included) in the health sense, in opposition to aesthetics or body improvement.  I'm not talking crazy here in listing these examples, which I believe are world wide common sense:   Eat at least 3 meals daily: breakfast, lunch and dinner. I'd bet most languages even have those 3 separated words to describe each of those meals. If not, they certainly do have this concept. Have around 8 hours of sleep, every day, despite recent studies. Brush and floss - rinse doesn't matter. Wash your hands (notice bath isn't required daily - not world wide at least).   Question here is: what else is there? Sunscreen, maybe? I'd like to know what is, today, considered consolidated things that every single human being should do daily to maintain good health - including nutrition and even, eventually, exercises. For any age or size, if that wasn't clear. "
268,Would riding kick scooter wear out your shoes?,"I've been thinking about getting a kickscooter (an adult one) and scootering from and to work for fitness and transportation. I need to go maybe 4-5km.  I'm just wondering, because you need to push with your leg, do the scooters wear out your shoes? Would they be suitable to wear work shoes with them? What are the best shoes for scootering? "
269,How to determine the highest quality fish oil?,"I've read many, many articles recently about how great fish oil is for you.  Awesome.  I'm in.   The hard part - which fish oil should I take?  There are so many of them.    What attributes make a fish oil ""high quality""? "
270,Is it better to avoid sunscreen if I know i'm not going to get burned?,"If I'm going out in the shade/sun for an hour, is it better to not wear any protection? Related, is the sun in small amounts / small intensities good for the skin?  In other words, is a little exposure a good thing that can quickly become a bad thing or should I minimize any and all exposure.  A directly related question, should I ever wear spf 15 or should I just put the max spf on everywhere I go?  edit: My current thoughts (very unscientific) are that wearing SPF 15 for most places provides a good balance between burning too fast and getting natural exposure to the sun.  Maybe the healthiest solution is to use the rub in tanner once per week and use SPF 70 for outings? "
271,How do I get non-sports people to get exercise or do an activity?,"Basically, we ask people to come play football, basketball, run, or even something easy like just throwing the frisbee around and no one can ever make it. They either don't respond at all, or have really really weak excuses. Like ""3 loads of laundry to do"" or ""it's a little warm out today"" when it's 72 and no wind.   These are all people who are in their early 20s and in relatively good health. Some married, some not. Most are computer nerds who spend the majority of their free time gaming(any kind) and typing on places like Stack Exchange. ;)  Any tips or tricks to get them to come outside and do something? Or should I just give up?  Also, maybe more on topic, any exercises that you'd recommend to get them active without it being too hard on ""beginners""? Sports or general fitness is ok. "
272,Numb Tingeling in Big Toes,"Me: Overweight 30 year old male.  This year has been a particularly inactive year* leading me to grow increasingly interested in getting into shape. Because of this, and other reasons, this lead me to start a new hard labor job.  this puts me on my feet 12 hours a day, doing physical labor, with a lot of walking. And shortly after this started my big toes have become constantly tingeing and numb feeling when pressure is applied to them.  Normally, my first thought would be diabetes, or some other overweight disease, but I know of none that are exasperated by extreme exercise. If it matters, prior to this job I did everything barefoot.  My question: Is this normal? Will bruised feet feel like this? Will it go away? Or is this likely a more serious condition.   This year was an anomaly.  "
273,"Is ""Why We Get Fat: And What to Do About It"" thesis correct?","Has anyone read ""Why We Get Fat: And What to Do About It""? Here is the book on amazon.  His basic argument is this (my words):     The author argues that insulin in   large part is responsible for   regulating how much fat you have, the   more the insulin the more fat. Insulin   tells your fat cell to absorb and   maintain their supply of fat, and not   to release it into the blood stream.   Insulin is produced in response to the   presence and amount of blood sugar in   your body, when you start to eat your   blood sugar increases. Fructose and   carbohydrates rapidly increase your   blood sugar levels resulting in a   highly elevated level of insulin.   Eating a lot of fructose and   carbohydrates every day will result in   a condition known as insulin   resistance. This will result in your   body having an elevated level of   insulin at all times, making you   virtually incapable of using anything   but glucose and carbohydrates as   energy. Because the cells in the rest   of your body quickly run out of energy   you get hungry faster because you are   just coasting off of the carbs from   your last meal.   My question is, is Gary Taubes correct? "
274,Is stretching cold muscles before cycling harmful?,"For most of my life, I stretched out before cycling to avoid cramps or pulling a muscle. However, I discovered last year that I could skip stretching exercises in favor of a slightly extended warm-up period, riding gently for about five minutes and avoiding any strenuous climbing.   Is stretching before non-weight bearing exercise (like cycling) detrimental to performance? Can gently stretching a cold muscle harm it? Should the intensity of your workout change when (or whether) you stretch out?   (My knowledge on this is strictly limited to trial and error with my own body and exercise routine, so it'd be helpful if answers were non-anecdotal.)  Related: Will stretching make me slower? on Bicycles.SE.  "
275,How do I fix my Power Clean?,"Background: I am changing my current barbell routine from StrongLifts to Starting Strength.  Problem: One of the five lifts in Starting Strength is the Power Clean, and my form is absolutely abysmal with it. The three largest problems with my form are as follows:   I have a hard time doing the explosive pull (the third step when you are effectively doing an upright row). Do I jump? Do I use hip thrust from end of last step? Neither? How do I catch the weight at end? Should it literally be landing on my shoulders with just my fingertips holding it in place? When I try this I always end up catching it with my hands (likely afraid of it injuring shoulder on landing). My movements are not at all fluid (granted this issue will largely resolve itself over time as I adjust to it).   How can I address these issues? Are there any cues that I should keep in mind while doing this? Are there any exercises I can practice that will help improve my form (aside from just doing tons of power cleans)? "
276,Is it true that 50% of nuts protein are not usable?,"I read somewhere that nuts are not good source of protein because only 50% of their protein are usable by body, Is it true? And if it is, why? "
277,How do you know how much effort to do and for how long?,"When stretching and flexing muscles, How much should I push my muscles and for how long before I take a few seconds break? I usualy push as far as I can, and for as much as time as I can, and only if it really hurts I stop. It can hurt even few hours later, so it's a little hint I'm doing it wrong, so I hope you could explain, how should I stretch?  Thanks. "
278,Are there such thing as best exercises for weightlifting?,"I've heard this many times from powerlifters that I've work with, ""All you really need is 3 lifts to hit all major muscle groups, and technically that's all you really need for maintenance, too.""  On top of my head, I would think that squat, deadlift and bench press are the three exercises that really target pretty much all the major muscle groups.  I would also recommend chin-ups/pull-ups and clean and press.  What are your thoughts about these 3 exercises (squat, deadlift and bench press) for hitting all the major muscle groups?  Also, are there any other exercises that you would recommend? "
279,How to get rid of belly fat for a Skinny-Fat person,"I am a skinny person with 179cm height and 64KG (141 Pound) however I've a lot fat around my belly and this often prevents me wearing T-shirts. The belly fat gives a very weird shape to my body.  To get rid of this belly fat I started Running and 1000 (2 sets)Jumping Rope (skipping) along with gym, but at the end of 2 months I end up loosing 4KG (68 to 64) but even though there was no visible change in my belly fat which made me appear even bad.  I wonder what is the best way to reduce belly fat for me without loosing much of the other fat and at the same time increase muscles mass? Will crunches do a trick or I should cardio exercise and first loose all fat and then start gaining the muscles mass? "
280,How much exercise for children?,When I was a kid we spent nearly every waking moment playing games and such OUTSIDE. We didn't have computers or video games to consume our time. Today's kids have a lot of modern devices that keep them inside and static.   How much time should kids be actively playing (exercising) a day or week? The NFL (American National Football League) has an ad campaign (Play-60) that encourages an hour a day of play. Does anyone know if there's any data to support this or any other amount per day? 
281,Functional trainer - is it worth to be one?,"My wife has chosen to be a functional trainer and is studying at the moment to have such a career.

Is it trendy enough in other countries? "
282,Wristpain after doing pullups,"A while ago I started working towards making my first pullup - I have been doing negatives for quite some time. Recently I decided Ill try to make a pullup, and I did. Over the course of a week or two I got to doing 3-4 pullups in a row, depending on how good a day Im having.  Recently I have been experiencing paint at my wrists. I cant really pinpoint situations in which it hurts, but it tends to be when im using force to keep the wrist straight or when there is a shock to it (for example, throwing a punch at a bag).  Im thinking my tendons and joints might not be ready for the challenges I present to them with my pullups.  What should I do? Should I take a break from pullups? Should I wrap my wrists? Should I go see a doctor? How to prepare my wrists for future exercise? "
283,What is the most optimum way to get best results out of protein shakes?,"I am 31 years old, here is my 4 days plan:   Tuesday: Biceps only - 1 hour Wednesday: Triceps only - 1 hour Thursday: Chest only - 1 hour Friday: Shoulder + Back - 1 + 1 hours Saturday+Sunday+Monday: No exercise, just posing (contracting muscles w/o weights) 10 mins a day   In above workout there is little warm up in beginning and warm down in end. Immediately after exercise I take 1 egg with cold water. After that one glass milk with oats+Poha, followed by normal routine food, in night I take two glucose biscuits and 1 glass milk. I started this in August 2014 - till now. In beginning by biceps were 13.8, now they are 14.5(after flexing), weight was 80Kilos and now it is 77Kilos. My target is 16 inches biceps (after flexing).    Keeping this routine when I can expect reaching my target? Should I purchase and protein shake in my routine to reach the target or that can be achieved without it? What is the most optimum way to get best results out of protein shakes?  "
284,Strengthening rolled ankle,"I know we have the question about what to do immediately after a rolled ankle, but this is different.   About 5 months ago I rolled my ankle, and I rested it and went to physio. However, it's still weak and I keep re-rolling it. I'm going to go back to physio. Is there anything I can do in the mean time? Is it safe to run, bike and swim?  Also when I rolled it the first time they gave me a cane. Was this good to use because I heard in the past doctors were much more into immobilizing an injury but then they found the muscles didn't really heal properly if they overdid it? "
285,What is causing my post-run hip pain?,"I am somewhat new to running, just picked it up about 2 years ago. My typical run is 30 minutes, about 2.5 miles. About three months ago I switched to a pair of minimalist-style Reeboks. For about a month now though, I have noticed that a couple hours after a run, I have an ache/pain on the front of my left hip. Do you think this is a result of poor form, or could this be due to the shoes? And if it's the shoes, what do you recommend I correct in my next pair (better ankle support?), which I hope to pick up this week. "
286,"Determining cause of, and counteracting, anterior pelvic tilt","Background  Over the past 3-4 months, I seem to have gradually caused myself an anterior pelvic tilt, and it's gradually causing stiffness and pain in my lower back. I wish to analyze possible causes and receive some tips on how to actively counteract it.  Workout routines  I follow a very basic 3-split (push, pull, legs) doing the compound exercises you'd expect;  Bench press, incline bench press, pullups, barbell rows, cable rows, squats, deadlifts.   And I of course supplement this with some isolation exercises. But in order to keep this question clean, I'll skip listing it unless any of you find it necessary.  My hypothesis  At my gym, every monday, wednesday and friday, one of the trainers who works there has a little 7 minute session where we do some ab-work, no pause. We do a variety of exercises such as various planks and crunches.  (I'm well aware of the drawbacks to crunches/situps, and I make sure to take proper precautions.)  But here's my theory: During these sessions, we often do ""ab exercises"" like knee raises, and static leg-raised holds. And I'm one of those people who don't get ANY ab-work done during this. It's all hip-flexors for me.  It seems to me that these exercises are causing my hip-flexors to stiffen up, and give me the anterior pelvic tilt.  Question  Could this be the reason for my anterior pelvic tilt?  For the time being, I plan on skipping these ab sessions, and rely on my own ab work (deadlifts), while catching up on stretching.  Does this seem like the right plan? Any suggestions for more/other measures? "
287,Skinny guy would like to get bigger (of course bigger muscles) but how?,"I'm 21 and I'm 178cm with 71 kg. I would like to reach 80kg.  I went to gym first 1,5 moths ago and I go to gym 3 times a week for 1 hour. (1 or more) I like in a university dorm so I can't eat a lot of meat and stuff what I would have to.  With what kind of dietary supplement can I get bigger?  In the first month I gained 2,5 kilograms. But of course, I want more.  How can I do it? "
288,what activity elevates your center of gravity?,"what sport or workout would elevate your center of mass/gravity?  bigger arms, tighter calves. would sprinting be a good exercise for this? "
289,Is 1 year a reasonable amount of time training for a challenging obstacle race?,"Some background info: I am 28 years old, about 177 cm tall and my weight fluctuates between 92-96 kg. Despite the unfavorable height/weight ratio, I am pretty heavy built, with wide shoulders and a broad chest. While I would not consider myself really fit or strong, I am also not really out of shape.   I spend a lot of time in front of a PC at work and at home. That being said I try to train at least twice a week; primarily playing football (indoors or outdoors) and try to work out at the gym on a regular basis (even though I cannot claim to have good discipline). I recently got introduced to the idea of obstacle races such as (Tough Viking, Warrior Dash, Spartan Race...) and come to like the idea. Especially setting the goal to finish such a race before I turn 30 in two years.   I do realize that these competitions are tough, and that they are aimed primarily at training-enthusiasts that invest much more time and money to their training than I do. However considering that I don't care about the racing aspect of it (i.e. I dont care my ""time"", but only to actually make it to the end without giving up), I think it's still a reasonable goal.   My specific questions are as follows:    Is 12 months too little time to train for such an event, assuming I do not drop focus on my work and social life? I like training, but I cannot allow training to take over my life altogether. I am concerned about my shoulders and lower back due to previous injuries, while I do not have any limitations in my daily life, I wonder if participating in such a race would be too much of a risk. What are good exercises for shoulders and lower back, considering the type of wear they will face during such a race? How important is condition in such an event? I usually get tired after running straight after 20 mins, but in interval training (e.g. football, squash etc) I can keep going at it for more than 1h without any trouble at all. Would this be an issue?     EDIT: I have mentioned that I have had several injuries without explaining what they are... I have had serious problems with my shoulders, as both have been dislocated more than once. I have been operated on one shoulder and have some rotation limitation (about 5-10 degrees on outwards rotation). With my weight it gets pretty painful in both shoulders, very quickly, when I attempt to do proper dips and pull-ups   With my lower back, I have had less but still painful problems, due to relatively sedentary life as well as some weird movement I did on the football pitch at some point. I have some sort of minor issue with discs but they doc said it wasn't serious enough for a surgery. I pay more attention to stretching and try to be more active during the day (at work that is) in order to help with that. Hope that helps to give a better picture of my physical situation. "
290,Can you use the treadmill with APT?,"Male, 16, 167 lbs. If I have anterior pelvic tilt, can I use the treadmill or will it worsen my situation? I’m trying to activate my glutes and hips (I can feel glutes, but can’t feel my hip at all), but my hamstrings keep tighteting intensely  instead in any exercise I try. I heard that mindfulness will help, and that it will work when I lose weight (my thighs and butt are way too fat), and I want to use the treadmill. Will it worsen my APT? Is there any other way? I have a sedentary lifestyle if that helps, too "
291,What are the optimal sets/reps for gaining speed?,"For example, in strength training it is relatively common knowledge that if you want to see your lifts go up, you should focus on doing 3-5 sets of 5 relatively heavy reps, with 3-4 minutes rest in between. Is there an equivalent with speed training? Say if I wanted to improve my 100m dash time as fast as possible, what would be the optimal training program in terms of intensity of reps and rest in between sprints?  I have actually never seen any empirical research done on this, so if you could point me to an article that would be awesome.  Everyone has heard of starting strength, is there starting speed?  Edit: How many 100m sprints should I do a training session to get at optimal speed? How long should I rest? I know it is a naive question because sprinters will not often do the same thing every workout, but I am curious. "
292,Panic when squatting,"I do not know if ""panic"" is the right word: every time I squat, when my stomach get compressed (during the descendent phase), I feel a real uncomfortable feeling. Something like a small panic attack. However, I am not scared of weightlifting and I have this feeling even when I am lifting only 80% of my 5RM. I may be wrong but I have the impression my body is reacting to some kind of compression of the diaphragm. Have you ever experience something like that? If yes, do you know what may be the cause and how to solve such an annoying problem? "
293,"Can you do ""too much"" cardio for cutting body fat?","My maintenance-calories number is fairly low (around 1500 calories), so I become very hungry if I cut based on diet alone. I've added basketball + HIIT-type training so that I can eat more and still be in a caloric deficit. Seems to be working fine thus far, but I've got to wonder...   Given that I aim to lose 1 pound a week, just how advantageous is this method (increased cardio + dieting) to losing body fat, especially without burning muscle? Along these lines, just hypothetically, if someone were to exercise enough to burn 1000 calories per day, but yet eat enough to maintain a 500-calorie deficit (hence 1 pound fat loss per week), how is this different from getting a 500-calorie deficit based on diet alone?  Thanks!  "
294,'Knees out' cue with front squat - could this be a source of minor knee pain?,"When I front squat I tend to attempt to perform the same moment as the back squat, but with anterior loading. The only difference I have made from my back squat is I 'break' at the hips, rather than the knees - when I say this, I mean I try and initiate a break at the hips first, not isolate it. I try to do both simultaneously.   I also try to 'push my knees out', as I always was taught to do with a back squat. The cue I had been using (which I think I picked up from a Chris Duffin video was to 'screw my heels into the floor. I have transferred this to front squats. For clarity I have not front squatted extensively, it is a new movement for me.  I had read you should treat anterior\posterior squatting moments the same (as far as the squatting movement is concerned).    Something I am doing is giving me minor knee pain, it feels as if it is on the inside of my knee. Am I right to be pushing my knees out? I tried not focusing on this and I think it felt better (but this was at the end of a session so I don't have much data). This morning I have read a couple of articles that suggest 'knees not in' makes more sense than 'knees out'.   Is it possible I am exaggerating 'knees out' and this causing me issues, but that it is more noticeable because of where I am loading with a front squat?  "
295,Bodyweight Bicep Excercises,Are there any bodyweight bicep exercises? Or any form of bicep exercise that can be performed without equipment? 
296,Most efficient way to burn fat?,"What is most efficient way to burn fat?  Not the fastest. I want to know how to target fat specifically if possible or just calories in general if not for the least effort output. Time spent exercising or the activity doesn't matter as much as long as total energy used is less (or maybe... perceived to be less).  I've read all about how HIIT will blast fat off - even after you are done working out, but that slow running will target fat specifically - and you can do that for a longer time.  1 hour of slow running generally seems easier to me than 20 minutes HIIT. At least psychologically. But is it really more efficient fat burn? You can (and should?) feel like death after a good HIIT session, and pretty fine after a pretty long run.  The math I tried:  HIIT feels like 100 effort  Easy Jog feels like 20 effort  HIIT  100 effort expended over 20 minutes &amp; 500 fat-based-calories burned   HIIT_EFFORT = 100 * 20 = 2000  Easy Jog  20 effort expended over 60 minutes &amp; 500 fat-based-calories burned  JOG_EFFORT = 20 * 60 = 1200  Results  HIIT: 500 calories / HIIT_EFFORT = 0.25 calories burned per effort  Jog: 500 calories / JOG_EFFORT = 0.42 calories burned per effort  In this case the easy jog is more efficient at fat burning than hiit.

297,Get thinner thighs,"I want to lose weight from my thighs and legs, but i have no time at all for exercising.  How can I achieve that using nutrition only? is it possible?  I read this article, is this diet efficient, or a little bit over?  I don't want to use chemicals, medicines, or creams. "
298,Is it wrong to workout more than once a day?,"Yesterday, I did a fairly heavy upper body workout around 11am. I worked my arms until I could barely move the EZ bar to put it away.   A while later, at around 7pm, I had had a couple drinks, and felt the need to workout again (I don't know why). I did another workout, almost as intense at the one earlier in the day; working the exact same muscles.  I know you're supposed to give your body time to rest between workouts, but it's within the same day, and I'm not doing any lifting today (the day after).   My question is, what was likely the result of the second workout that day? Was it more likely to be beneficial, or harmful?   I'm a 23 year old male.  "
299,Do we need contiguous sleep for gains?,"We know that sleep is important for gains, but does that sleep need to be contiguous?  What if we slept in phases, each time waking up after REM sleep, and then going to bed a couple hours later?  Or more practically, sleeping for say 5 hours, and then taking naps throughout the day (making sure the naps last long enough to get us through deep sleep).  Would we get the same benefits, or must sleep be contiguous? "
300,Wobble chair or exercise ball for prolonged sitting at the office desk?,What are the advantages and disadvantages of wobble chair over exercise ball used as alternative (supplementary) chair for prolonged sitting at the office desk?   (Tip: with exercise ball you will get your pants dirty.) 
301,My elliptical cycle is too easy for me... I don't want to throw it away. What can I do with it?,"I bought an elliptical cycle to lose weight. After losing some weight and getting used to it now it feels as easy as walking. It is basically useless now. But I don't want it to go to waste. So I'm looking for a way to make it useful for my workout.  Can I increase its resistance by modifying it somehow?   Would wearing a 40lbs rucksack while using it a good idea?   PS: This is the cycle I have.  It has 11-pound magnetic flywheel, which is why it is so easy I think. "
302,Stubborn Chest Fat/One side of chest length longer,I have two questions regarding this picture of myself:   How can I get rid of that stubborn chest fat that's surrounding my nipples? As you can see the right side of my chest is longer than my left side. What can I do about that?   I started jogging/walking (80% walk + 20% jog) should I continue it? What should I change? 
303,Losing Lean Muscle Mass (Detraining),"I have never fully understood how this exactly works.  These questions pertain to the long term effects of strength training only.    Basic Physiology of Hypertrophy (what is understood)   During muscle hypertrophy you’re tearing myofibrils, which are composed of stacked sarcomere’s. This tearing causes the immune system to repair the damage.  Proteins called cytokines are released to the damaged area. The repair occurs as satellite cells differentiate into myocytes (muscle cells) which then fuse the torn myofibrils together which increases the diameter of the myofibril.     Sources:  [website][website]The Physiological Effects of Detraining (what I DO NOT understand)  Detraining (as related to long term strength training) obviously    leads to loss of muscular strength and power.        At a basic physiological level, how is this occurring?   Are the sarcomeres (containing myosin and actin) used as fuel by   your    body and expelled?   After myofibrils decrease in diameter since they now contain less   contractile proteins?        Full and Partial answers are both great -- ideally with supporting research.  Thanks! "
304,Distinguish stretching from warming up?,"I've recently started running and I'm having a hard time distinguishing warm-up from stretching exercises. I've read that I should do warm-up before running and stretch after running. Is that correct?  Also, could you point out a few good warm-up methods that I can do without equipment at home before I start running? I know I could warm up while running, but it's becoming cold outside, so I would like to warm up before leaving the house ... "
305,How do I build my obliques?,"I've tried for a couple of months now and I just can't seem to build on my obliques.. I have minimal trouble getting and keeping my 6 pack, but I just can't get those darn obliques. It looks really awkward having a decent set of abs and then nothing to wrap them.  At the moment I work on these in the same sessions as my abs.. I figured this was ok as they're all part of my core. Maybe this is the problem?  At the moment I generally run my core workout like so:   Standard crunches - 3x20. Floor oblique crunches - 5x20 each side. Reverse crunches - 2x60. Oblique dumbbell side lifts - 3x20 (20kg). Bicycle crunches - 3x10.   What can I do specifically to place more emphasis on my obliques and build them up? Should I break up my ab workout and my oblique workout? "
306,Is this running plan a good idea?,"So, what I've been doing is this:  On a treadmill, run .1 MPH faster and .05 miles further than I did last time, every other day.  The problem is, my calves are often sore for several days; at 210, I probably qualify as a heavier runner.  Does anyone know if it safe/effective for me to use this ramp up plan?  Should I wait until I am no longer sore to continue?  Should I run each speed/distance combination more than once? "
307,Is there any benefit to doing supersets over taking the traditional one-exercise-at-a-time approach,Do Supersets make it any easier for you to go through with your workout ?   And since you train different body parts when doing a superset is the intermediate rest period accounted for at least partially?  
308,Subseting with second muscle group,Just a question about subsetting:  My week is broken up to two muscle groups on 4 days a week. Let's say I'm doing back and Bis on the same day; would it be bad if I subset my back exercises with my bicep exercises to cut down on time? Or is that going to effect my gains or cause injury? I was just thinking that I could utilize my rest time by using it to hit the exercises I need to do for the other muscle group.  For clarification let's say it back/bi day. I do 4 back exercises (1 is a set of 4 and the rest are sets of 3) and 4 bicep exercises (1 is a set of 4 and the rest are sets of 3) I'll do back exercise 1 set 1 and immediately follow it with bicep exercise 1 set 1 and then have a short rest before doing set 2 of both. 
309,Whey Protein before or after workout? type 1 diabetic.,"as it says in the post I am type 1 diabetic, I got it randomly when I turned 23, I am in pretty good shape, work construction everyday, I'm 6ft 165. I am trying to put on some weight and whey protein has basically no carbs, just calories and protein which is perfect because it wont make my sugar spike up. I do the gym a few days a week after work, or on the weekends, but not working out everyday other than manual labor in construction. When should I take the protein? In the morning before work? or before the gym if I'm not working that day? Or should I take it after work or after a workout? any opinions would help, thank you.  "
310,Running impact on lung for smoker,"I'm running once up to twice in the week , mostly saturday morning, one hour from 4-5 a.m, I'm wondering if there is some positive impact on my lung ( smoker lung) other than just normal positive impact a runner can get? I mean like somehow it cleans nicotine from my lung? I'm sorry if this is a dummy question ( as some might say, "" well smoking is bad anyway"") but as you know that nobody smoking doesn't realize the risks they can probably get from the bad activity, but we're smoking because we get addicted, and quitting on it, is not a short time goal). One thing for sure that I always notice is that during 2 days, after running, I feel like a ciggarete tastes very bad (like food without salt, some think like that). I need some advices. Thank you very much for your time. "
311,How long do I have to train to be a Ultra Trail Runner?,"If someone would like to be a Ultra Runner from zero, for how long would have to train for the body to get in perfect shape of an 80k ultra race... 6 months? 1 year? 2-3 years? "
312,Walking long distance vs cardio,"Because for looking reasons (sweating) and lack of free time, I decided to convert my 40min cardio in the morning per day (I'm doing this usually), to walking to my office which is about 4.5km (2.79 miles) from my home.   With the cardio I burned about 300 to 570 calories. With the long distance walking, from home to office and vice versa (9km or 5.59 miles), and with the help of a GPS mobile app (runtastic like), it shows that I'm burning about 530 calories.  Is it possible? Which is your recommendation?  My main goal is fat loss. I do daily strength training for core and upper body.  I prefer walking because when I'm at the office I'm not tired or sweating excessively. I read that cardio is melting fat, especially in the morning before breakfast, but also I know that a burned calorie is a burned calorie.   (I've lost 19kg/41.88 lbs since August) "
313,Muscular body building by gym,"Is joining a gym for getting a muscular body and good physique really worth it?   I mean, how beneficial is a gym membership for staying in shape? "
314,Walking vs Biking a mile,"I have about a mile walk every morning -- would I get more exercise biking or walking that same mile?   Some background:  I am trying to lose weight -- I am right now using MyFitnessPal to track my eating habits and exercise et al -- but I need to lose more than 20-25 pounds since I am right now in the ""overweight"" category of BMI.  Which --- biking or walking, will help me lose weight more efficiently? "
315,"What reps/sets should I use in bodyweight excersices, if I need to train for total count of repetitions?","For example, I'm currently doing a lot of push-ups, and I need to increase number of push-ups I am able to do in a row (currently, I can do 34 push-ups in a single attempt).  My current routine is simple: 5-7 times a day I do a maximum of push-ups possible (currently that's 33-34), and I do this 7 times a week.  What will be good training regime for it? Should I do several sets in a row (like 3x20) several times a day, or should I just do maximum number of push-ups in one set several times a day? Should I proceed with the routine 7 days a week, or some resting days are required?  EDIT: I discovered hundredpushups.com, and they say there that 3 days a week, 4-5 sets on each day is the best way. How that could be possible? The total number of pushups a week is about 10 times smaller than I currently achieve, yet they advertise quicker improvement? "
316,do runners think that each leg plays a different role? do they run with asymmetry?,"For forever, I've been an ""on again"" / ""off again"" runner. I never stayed with a schedule for more than 2 weeks because of sloth.  Starting 2 months ago, I started running 3 miles 6 time per week. I'm fast and loving it. This Sunday, I upped my daily mileage from 3 to 6 miles. Now, at about mile 4, I keep getting some kind of weird discomfort where my left leg connects to the hip. I keep going with no trouble. But, I am thinking that something is just not right. I'm seriously worried this involves my joint? cartilage? bone?   For years. walking or running, my shirt collars always bunch-up next to my neck on the right side, and fall-off to the left (exposing like half my left shoulder). I am right-handed and right-footed. I had a bike accident 6 years ago that broke my left clavicle, but no noticeable hip damage. I think that, to a lesser degree, I had this shirt collar issue before the clavicle break.   To maybe fix this hip issue, I am going to try to use my left leg, more than my right leg, for propulsion and lift. The role of the right leg will become more about balance. Do runners normally think about the role of each leg?  A right-handed person has a stronger right leg, right? There must be asymmetry when you run. And, at the least, some sort of asymmetry is revealed in my shirt collar. Maybe, the asymmetry is causing the hip soreness as well? I need to adjust and adjust until my shirt collar stops falling completely to the left? "
317,Fat gain/shape after liposuction,"I have learned a few facts about the human body over the years and there seems to be some contradiction.   -Fat cells never go away, even when you burn the energy within them. They only shrink in size when their energy stores are used up. Once fat cells are created, you have them for good.   -lipo suction removes the fat cells forcibly, circumventing the above issue, as least on a small scale. I.e only the fat that is not interweaving in your body and could cause damage if removed.    after lipo, over eating again would cause other areas of your body to gain weight first before the lipo areas.  fat can still grow back in the lipo areas.    Okay so my question is how to properly reconcile all these facts and/or cut out what is fiction. In short my questions are:   considering how easy it is for a non-lipo adult to gain weight back after being over weight, is it just as easy to get back into your previous shape after lipo?  put another way, if you lipo off your lower belly fat (currently it's the first spot to gain the weight and the last spot to lose) will the lower belly fat be the first place to come back after lipo if you eat a lot?    How will the lower belly react to excessive food?    what does one do about excessive skin after lipo?    I may have other questions but this is good for now. I am a Caucasian male in early 30s. "
318,The n sets and m reps formula,"When I was younger, I was always given some training plan where I had to do, lets say, as an example, 3x8 bench presses. Also, another rule was that if I could only do this with 70kg, I could not do 75kg 3x6 to build up to eventually being able to do 3x8 bench presses with 75kg.   I was never able to get any results from this. In the example above, I would be stuck with 70kg 3x8 bench presses for months, and then just give up because I was not making any progress.  With other heavy lifting, like pull ups, the advice is quite different; If you cannot do one, do a half. In this case, I was able to make progress. I can now do five pull ups.   This makes me suspect that I should have been allowed to build up to lifting more weight. Any time I have made progress have been when I ignored the ""lift as much weight as you can lift nxm times"".  Most training plans online also involve doing an exercise nxm times. The question I have is, how do you make progress? Are you supposed to lift x kilos until you can lift x+y kilos the same number of times as you could lift x kilos previously? "
319,"""Continuous Passive Motion"" (CPM) for Joint Healing, Effective? How?","First of all - I expect this question to get very little attention: It's amazing how little attention people who work out seem to give to joint health.  Anyway, it seems that moving the joint ""passively"" (which seems to vary in definition from the joint being moved through ROM by a machine to moving the joint on you own with very little resistance). There is a study of rabbits that shows that rabbits with damaged cartilage healed faster when the injured joint was put through passive motion:     At three weeks this assessment revealed that in the adolescent rabbits, healing of the defects by hyaline articular cartilage was present in 8 per cent of forty defects in ten animals whose knees were immobilized, in 9 per cent of forty defects in ten animals whose knees were permitted intermittent active motion, and in 52 per cent of forty defects in ten animals whose knees were managed immediately after operation by continuous passive motion.    [website]So - two things from this study:      The idea that cartilage can heal, which most surgeons will vehemently deny.    The idea that a joint put through ""CPM"" is 5 times more likely to heal than a joint that is not.    However, if we look at a summary of studies, the results seems more vague:     The reported clinical results, combined with the existing basic science evidence, suggest that there may be an ideal combination of all 3 treatments—CPM, AROM, and early weight bearing—that is most advantageous for both quality of life and quality of healing. Appropriate basic science research and focused clinical research are needed to generate postoperative rehabilitative protocols that will maximize benefits of articular cartilage repair and restorative procedures as they continue to advance and gain popularity.   [website]There is also an article by some guy named Doug Kelsey that stipulates that:     Injured joints like movement, generally, and dislike being still. For an injured knee, I suggest things like a furniture slider, or even a paper plate to place your foot on and slide the foot forward back while in a sitting position. You can do this for 5-10 minutes a few times a day and most people find it quite helpful.   His example of AROM (basically moving joint lightly with no resistance) is shown in this picture:    [website]It seems to me that he is just jumping on the ""synovial fluid circulation promotes healing via nutrient delivery since blood flow is poor"" idea. Edit: Also seems that his book isn't on sale on Amazon, so there aren't any real reviews, which makes me skeptical.   TL;DR: Is there any conclusive reason to believe that motion with no resistance heals joints? If so, how much and what kind?  "
320,One arm chin/pull-up and the lat pulldown machine,"I'm currently encountering a weird discrepancy between the force I can generate to lift my  body with one arm and the amount of weight I can pull down with one arm at the lat machine, using a one-handed handle.  At this machine I can only pull 60kg (132lbs) twice, as compared to lifting my 86kg (190lbs) bodyweight two thirds of the way.  Many people report they only have to lift 65-75% of additional bodyweight on weighted pullups to manage an OAC. This makes sense because your body is in a more efficient pulling position for the OAC, thus utilizing more muscles and furthermore less muscles are pulling in contradicting directions, thus fewer forces are canceling themselves out.  However, this does not apply for the OAC vs. One arm lat pull (OLP). Can friction of the machine play such a big role? It has a 1-to-1 transmission, and only one big wheel to direct the rope. My knees press against some stabilizer, may this cause my body to tilt less, and therefore utilize less muscles?  My general question is, where does this discrepancy originate from? "
321,How to avoid cramps during beach volleyball tournament (extreme hot weather),Just a quick question when summer came.  I usually play 5 to 6 matches on beach volleyball tournaments and there is 35 Celsius degrees in the shadow but of course there is no shadow on the field. Sometimes you can even burn your feets by hot sand if you are not using neoprene socks.  For example last 2 matches I usually experience cramps in my calfs. So many full-power jumps during last 4 matches cruelly decided.  How to alleviate these? Do you use any special drinks during such an excessive performance (instead of hypotonic iont drinks and a lot of water)? Salt? Magnesium?  I know harder training can help here but what can I do in terms of supplementation? 
322,Joint strength progress,"Normally my workouts are HIIT style, so there are not many reps. So far I am quite satisfied with my progress, but after some minor injury on my knee in am wondering if lowering weight and increasing reps will be easier on my joints.  In my case, my muscle mass always reacted better with lower volume, but it is hard to quantify if my joints are getting stronger or not. Also I do not believe in one training style being good for everything without tradeoffs, so assuming that HIIT was the best for muscle strength, I wonder if other type of training will be better for joint strength.  It might be just a foolish theory, but I always got the feeling that with lower reps my muscles developed faster than my joints, while higher reps gave me a feeling of greater endurance and better joints.   Is it possible to quantify my joint strength progress? Which type of training promotes stronger + healthier joints? Can both things be achieved with the same training style?   "
323,Is Protein powder necessary for weight loss?,"Last week, I joined a gym for weight loss. On the first week, my instructor gave me a workout cycle of 15 min of treadmill, 15 min of afx, 15 min of cycling, sit-ups, and lateral lunges. And suddenly this week he instructs me to do bench-presses with 5 kgs, also cable shrug and cable triceps with 15 kgs. In those workouts, my left hand is much weaker than my right. My instructor is suggesting protein powders. Is this necessary, or can't I do it with regular diet?   Also, is my workout schedule correct for weight loss? "
324,Should I be building strength if I have very tense back/shoulder muscles?,"I have very tense muscles in my back (mainly my traps) and I am having trouble relaxing them.  Physios have told me that my lower traps and rhomboids are weak and I should be trying to strengthen them.  The problem is that different health professionals have advocated for and against strength training while the muscles are tense. But the muscles are tense partly because of muscle imbalance (I work as a programmer and my shoudlers have rounded and my head pokes forward a little bit).  The other reason they are tense is because I experience a lot of anxiety which manifests in the neck/shoulder/back region  My current approach to solving this problem is :   Psychologist and meditation for anxiety (root cause), and progressive muscle relaxation Static stretches from the physio (traps, pecs, seratus anterior, lats) Pilates once a week 15mins Yoga daily Swimming 30mins (mainly breaststroke and backstroke) 3x a week, with cycling for 30mins as a change. Sauna after swim.   I don't seem to be getting any results. The stretches don't seem to have a big impact, the yoga and pilates feel good, but I'm not sure I do enough of them, and the swimming doesn't seem to build strength.  Do I have to relax my back muscles before building strength? Does swimming build body strength? Would weights be an option? How can I get an objective measure of how these things are helping (either in building strength or flexibility)? Any ideas on other approaches.  I'm thinking about self-administered trigger point therapy and using a bio-feedback device to learn not to tense my shoulders.  I'm asking here because different Physio's have advocated completely different approaches.  Thanks for any help! "
325,Arm workout similar to P4P's ab series?,"I've been doing the 8 min ab exercises from passion4profession, and would like to do something similar for my arms.   The exercises in the video are all done without any equipment, they work their way up from very easy to very hard, and everything seems very professional. I'm having trouble finding any similar routines for the upper-body. I only have a chin up bar and a couple weights, so anything beyond that I wouldn't be able to do.   Does anyone know of a similar program for arms?  edit: Also, I'm aware of the p90x, but I definitely won't be doing that.

326,"What is the best posture (stand, sit, etc) to take when resting during intense training (such as for kickboxing)?","Background  In college, I had the honor of participating in a wrestling training seminar led by a coach of an elite wrestling program in the States. During the lesson, he (the coach) mentioned that he didn't allow his team to sit during training except in a ""seiza"" (Japanese word) way (meaning sitting with the lower half of the leg beneath the thigh).  Now I've become a coach myself (in striking/mma), and I'm wondering whether or not I should tell my squad to avoid sitting except in the seiza way (unless they're injured). I naturally understand the desire for the squad members to want to sit between rounds on their butt.  Question  I don't want to impose something that brings no or little benefit to my squad. So my question:   Generally put, is there any scientific justification/benefit (explicit or likely) to instructing the athlete to not sit/sit on their butt during intensive combat sports training (as opposed to just weight lifting)?   If yes, what? (if possible, w/ links to articles, etc)  For example, let's take a session of 10 rounds of intense kickboxing sparring where 1 round is 3-5 min. If a fighter does 3 rd, and rests out 1 rd (the 4th rd), to then join back on the 5th round:  Is there any strong enough/plausible scientific reason/merit to have him/her not sit/sit on his butt during that 4th round, and instead remaining standing, or sit in a seiza way? (You can vary the example if the answer depends on the duration of rest, intensity/type of exercise, etc.)  (This seems partly related to topics covered in discussion/explanation on cool downs.)

327,Can swimming significantly help to improve vertical jump?,"I've met physical education teacher in the swimming pool and he told me that swimming will NOT have significant effect for developing my vertical jump.  If we omit weight loss caused by swimming and better core muscles stability, can swimming help in developing leg (vertical jump) specific muscle groups? Or swimming (crawl) is focused on developing exactly contra non-water-sports muscle groups?  "
328,Safe training regime to work towards center and front splits,I want to improve my flexiblity to be able to to center and front splits. Is there any safe exercise program to follow which will lead me to this goal?  During the week I have time to stretch for 10 min a day (perhaps sometimes even 2 sessions a day). At the weekend I have more time for longer sessions.   So what exercises should I do? How long should I hold the stretches? How often repeat it? How intense should the stretch be? (Should I do several rounds with increasing intensity in each session?) Any special stretching techniques that will help? On which days should I do which exercises in which order?   To measure my current status towards the front split I measured the angle in this position (it's not me on the picture) and got about 135 degree.   
329,"I'm losing weight, I can tell but why does the scale go up? Am I doing it wrong?","I am doing nearly 60 of what I call ""sit squats"" a night (You sit on your knees and push up, almost like when you're riding a horse and stand up in the saddle, bad explanation sorry). 10 crunches, some random exercises for thighs that I've found on Instagram and 20 second plank every night without fail for three weeks now. I know it's working, my thighs are slowly becoming more toned, it's easier to do the squats and crunches but the number on the scale goes up. I started at 12 stone 3 pounds. I recorded a new weight the next Thursday (I weigh myself every Thursday at around 6pm) and had not gained or lost, (I re-weighed the next morning and was down to 12 stone 1 pound) but two weeks later (tonight) I am currently at 12 stone 5 pounds. That's the heaviest I can remember. I don't know if it's because of the food I ate for dinner, or the muscle mass increase (though it weighs the same as fat) but I am gaining according to the scale. I am going to re-weigh tomorrow for sure but I'm just wondering why? I am on a diet, I know the amount of exercise I'm doing isn't really enough to lose weight, just enough to tone some muscles but is there anything more I can do?    I am 16, female, 5ft 5 inches tall.  I can't join a gym until I am 18, legally anyway. My lowest weight I can remember was around December 2015, at 11 stone 13.    ANYTHING back would be amazing! I need to know why the scale has gone up when my stomach feels smaller, I will keep going and not give up because it must be working but I am wondering if I'm doing something wrong?  "
330,Lacking the amount of energy that needs for a good workout at gym,I daily plan to workout and hit at the gym but I come home fully exhausted. I lack the amount of energy that needs for a good workout at gym. How can I cope up with this? Anything that could keep me energetic and motivated to exercise when I come back home? 
331,What is the safest wrist angle for pushing exercises?,"When doing push exercises, such as the bench press and military press, what is should the angle of the wrist be to prevent injury? Should the wrist be straight or should it be bent like the following image?   "
332,What type or amount of weight training is beneficial for a beginning swimmer?,"I started swimming regularly about a month ago, and I can currently swim freestyle less than 75m before I have to stop and recover for a short time.  I have a simple goal of being able to cover 500m without completely exhausting myself.  Assuming I have a fixed amount of time at the gym each week, should I be spending as much as possible in the water to work on my technique until I stop seeing improvement, or does it make sense to spend any of that time on weight training instead?  If so, what should I focus on?  Are there specific exercises that would help with my form and endurance?    To provide some more detail, here are the main problems I continue to run into with the freestyle stroke, even as my form improves:   My arms, shoulders, and upper back tire quickly, and when they do, my need for air increases and my form suffers. Slowing my kicking and/or stroke rate affects my body position, which negatively affects my form and efficiency. There is no sustainable pace.  I can swim separate 50 yard laps almost endlessly, but only with short rests between to catch my breath and let my arms recover.   I feel like the overall problem is a lack of strength and endurance in my upper body, which could possibly be addressed more directly by weight training than swimming alone. "
333,What are you views on progress between rep range vs. fixed reps?,"Assuming the goal is to progress in size and strength using weight training, what are you thoughts on a routine that either:  1) Uses a rep range of 5-8 (for example), where you start workout day 1 with a weight heavy enough that you can do 5 reps but not 6. And over the next few days/workouts, you use the same weight but aim for a 6th rep (assuming correct form and same speed), and over the next few workouts, a 7th, and finally an 8th rep (means you became stronger overtime). THEN you add enough weight to the same exercise so your next workout will end at 5 reps again, and you challenge yourself to reach the 8th rep over the next few workouts.  Or...  2) A routine that uses a fixed rep limit, say 5 reps dead, so the weight is heavy enough to complete 5 reps but not a 6th. In the next workout, you add a little weight (2 lbs for example), and aim to do 5 reps again.  My thoughts on number 1 is it becomes a nice challenge but I'm not sure if it will help with the goal of strength and size. My thought on number 2 is it will be quicker to stall because adding weight to the bar every workout will mean I will struggle with that weight if my strength doesn't keep up, and I may not have weights small enough to add in very small increments.  Please can I have some thoughts on this? I like the sound of method 1, but is there anything wrong with it? "
334,Teen Looking to transform,"Height: 5'11 Weight: 160 lbs (fluctuates anywhere from 156 - 160) Body fat percentage: According to the internet, I'm at about 13%   Hi, I'd like to know how I can ""start"" working out. I'll be 16 in two weeks and throughout high school, I've done a lot of cardio for basketball. I've never consistently lifted because I don't have enough money for a gym membership and I've never invested in weights. I'm looking to transform and gain muscle for sports. Is it possible to transform without weights and only body weight? I've tried home exercises, but I never know what parts of my body to work and when. There are so many different websites and places to get advice, but each sound so contradicting and suggest different things. Is there a plan or specific beginner workout I can try that only uses body weight? If i absolutely have to invest in some workout equipment, what are the most essential items? If anyone can please give me a CLEAR sort of instruction or guidance on what workout outs to do, when, and what days. I will follow the plan, i just need some guidance. I feel like I have the kitchen part down, because I already eat healthy anyways. I never really gain weight, but I feel like i can't get rid of my stomach fat (i can feel muscle under after flexing). In the past two years, I've lost a ton of weight, but sadly, I've lost a lot of arm muscle as well, which I hope to get back. If anyone can help, I'd really appreciate it. "
335,Gas out of lung while doing russian twists,"when I'm doing russian twist I can feel air went out of my mouth with slight wheezing sound. I mean the physics is obvious (ofc gas go out when I do exercise that put pressure on lung) but I just want to make 3x sure that this is okay/normal esp with the wheezing sound? It's not my lung get punctured slightly? Currently I'm not doing this, and as I breath normally and I don't feel anything different except maybe 5% more difficult to breathe (like when you're underwater, but not that much) and after 10 minutes it's gone (still feel this air going out when I twist).   The reason I'm worried about punctured lung (or any kind of possible weird but potentially fatal trauma) is because I fell during ski and instead of bruising muscle pain, I feel weird ticklish-every 15second kind of sharp pain deep inside near the liver/under ribcage area. I really don't think it's punctured lung because it should produce more noticeable symptom (like collapsed lung) and should not cause air to go out... but I'm triple checking because I'm not an expert on this kind of thing.  If this help: I skied once in my life and I was on green slope so it was fine except I didn't know how to stop/turn, I go straight full speed from top to bottom and fell on my left side at the bottom with pretty high speed (for me) and went unconscious for 1 minute. Then this sharp pain happened on my center-right side, but it wasn't bad so I ignored it.  I'm 25y/o female, physically at the normal weight (120lbs/5'4"") but I've never exercised until 2-3 weeks ago (the ""go upstairs 2 floors and out of breath""- kind of person). I have a slight asthma when I was young but never bothered me much. Recently I started to do more cardio-type exercises (bike/run) and like a normal unfit person I ran out of breath very easily etc. This has happened for 2-3 weeks and I'm better at endurance. This wheezing thing never happened ever, even when I ran out of breath with other cardio type exercises. Only noticed after I started to do this russian twist.   Thanks people! "
336,Is there a recommended running technique if you're overweight?,"I started running about 3 weeks ago (3 x a week) in an effort to get in better shape and lose weight. I have noticed my stamina improving but my joints still hurt (knees &amp; ankles) after I run. I am running about 4 miles each time I go out. I currently mix in some walking with the running too.  Is there any particular technique or way to run (like heel-toe or on the balls of your feet, knees bent more/less?) that would lessen the impact on these joins or do I just need to tough it out until I've lost enough weight to where the joint pain isn't as great? Currently I can run about a mile and a half before the pain around my knees is enough to make me want to stop and walk for about a quarter-mile before starting to run again. "
337,How important is periodization in force training?,"How important is a periodization planning in a weight, force training? I mean the exercises you do in a gym besides the cardios.  I'm not a professional in the field, but I started to study periodization of training. I understand that it's a methodology created for high level athletes, but there are authors that adapted it to force training and I don't see anybody using it in gyms.   So the benefits of a periodization are smaller for non athletes? What's the difference between doing the same exercises with no recuperation microcycles over 2 months or doing a periodization where I follow weeks less intense and others more intense?  "
338,Objective test for running shoe cushioning deterioration,"Is there an objective test that I can use to determine the deterioration of my running shoes cushioning? I follow the rule of thumb and replace my shoes after about 500km. But some shoes feel like the cushioning deteriorate faster than others.     Edit: In the answers, outsole and cushioning height is mentioned. While the outsole of my shoe is somehow noticable, how would I measure the cushioning height? From the side and the back, new and old shoe look the same. However measuring depth of the shoe inside, it looks like there is 3mm difference!  My new shoe (0km, bottom/left) vs. old shoe (500km+), outsole comparison and heel height comparison. The old shoe cushioning feels worse only after some distance (few km). I am a midfoot/heel striker and run on the road.    Note that the shoes are not perfectly size-aligned on the second image.   "

340,Dealing with jet lag when travelling internationally for a marathon?,I live in Europe and will be travelling to the US for the Chicago marathon.   I would like to stay a week in the US.  How do you minimize the effects of jet lag for the day of the race? Is it best to arrive to the US ahead of time or right before the race?  Any nutrition advice to speed up recovery?  This question also applies when travelling West to East? Do you apply the same advices when going West-to-East and East-to-West? 
341,Should I stretch every day?,"For workouts, I know that it's not effective to train the same muscle group every day because the muscle needs time to recover.   Does the same principle also apply to stretching? Is it still effective to stretch the same muscle group every day or should I make a pause of 48 hours to give the muscles time to recover?   Update: It's actually two questions: Is it okay for the muscles to stretch every day, and is it still effective or can the same flexibility be reached with stretching just 2 or 3 times a week? "
342,"Is there a specific, efficient way to pedal a road bike?","I know that this may sound silly, but I was wondering if there is a proper way to pedal the road bike?  I've noticed that you can be pedaling more with the front, or balls of the feet, or by staying flat for the most part, or even having the heel of your foot slightly angled down.  Is there a specific way to pedal that will yield the most efficient use of 'foot power'?  If so, what makes that specific technique more efficient?  "
343,What role does sugar and blood sugar levels play on diet?,"My understanding on diet and what foods I should be eating to maintain a low body fat percentage is very amateur. All this time I have just been looking at the calories in the nutritional facts label and if it's low I think it's fine to eat and if it's high I avoid it.  But I'm beginning to see there is a whole lot more to it than that. For example I have always eaten lots of white rice (it's my staple food) but now I see this type of carb is bad for weight loss. Not sure why though, something to do with being high in the gyclemeic index I hear.  My question is, what role does sugar and blood sugar levels play in weight and metabolism.  If I want to lose body fat I need to keep my metabolism high correct? So fat burns quicker rather than being stored.  How to speed up metabolism diet wise? Is it by avoiding sugars or always keeping blood sugar levels high?  Does it matter where the sugar is coming from, for example fruits vs raw sugar from a bag?  Any explanations are appreciated. "
344,"I am on the Atkins diet and weightlifting everyday, what is this doing to my body?","I am a novice.

I work out everyday, and I'm following Mark Rippetoe's Starting Strength (except for the diet part, as outlined in my question). I have been doing this consistenty for the past two weeks.

346,How deep should a squat be?,"Recently, I've read some articles that suggest that you should go below 90 degrees.   On the other hand, I've talked with a trainer in my gym, and he usually places a bench behind him so that he couldn't go below 90.   What is your take? Below 90 or 90?  Note: When I'm talking about degrees, I mean the angle your shin bone and femur makes. "
347,What is the minimum long run training distance to finish a half-marathon?,"As per the title, what is the minimum long run training distance to merely be capable of finishing a half-marathon? I've been trying to research this myself and answers seem to be all over the place ranging from 7 miles all the way up to 14 to 15 although the latter might be for more competitive runners.

350,Sprinting and weight lifting,"   TL:DR I want to do one day weights, next day sprint, repeat. Viable?   Is lifting weights every second day, and sprinting every alternate second day a viable plan?  I am 6ft tall at 78kg(172lb), and do the lifts:  DL,Squats,BarBench,BarRows,BarbOverhead mainly. I am working on strength primarily with my weights. I believe squats and DL might have some trouble in regards to spriting viability.  Any ideas?  Edit:   I am willing to rest two days a week Currently I lift every second day(and am progressing slowly in strength gains) I will be eating at a caloric surplus I want to gain strength simultaneously   Lifting stats:   Bench - 1RM 110kg Squat - I didn't realise I was above parallel for a very long time, so it was ~160kg, now below parallel it has went from 80kg starting to 100kg(only found out recently) for 3x5. Overhead - 1RM 70kg BarbRow - 1RM 70kg Deadlift - 1RM 130kgraw, 155kg straps   Sprinting:  Never done any sprinting and have no experience, haven't jogged in a long time either. "
351,What difference does hand/arm position make in chin-ups,"What difference, if any, will it make if my hands are over the bar rather away from me or behind the bar towards me when doing a chin-up?  Does this work different sets of muscles?  Is one more difficult than the other?  Should my workout contain different sets of both ways or is it just a preference thing? "
352,How do I know how much weight I should be lifting with dumbells?,"I was just given a set of weights - adjustable weight dumbells -  as a present, but I have no idea what sort of weights/how many reps I should be doing in order to achieve the best results.   I'm looking to increase the strength of my arms and wrists (lean strength?), and hope it can increase my strength for playings sports like tennis, squash and so on.  Is there a rule of thumb for weights/reps I should be aiming at? "
353,Water intake; an optimal balance between water and oxygen for endurance sports,"Is there a balance of how much water should be taken in? The specific scenario I am referring to, would be sports, in my case, hockey. When I first started playing hockey I drank two 16 oz plastic water bottles during a game, now at a minimum, I have three sips of one of those same water bottles during a game. I am more conditioned and I do believe I have more endurance, which may require less water? Why - because my muscles hold more water??  I am always wondering if less, smaller, more frequent gulps of water may be more effective; but even then, during a game, I merely drink water because I brought the bottle out on the bench with me.  On the other side of the equation, I wonder if oxygen is really what I need more of. When I watch professional hockey players on national TV, I see them taking small sips and often spitting water out immediately after taking a sip. This unfortunately draws be to a perhaps an absurd conclusion - are they only looking to absorb water through their salivary glands? Is there a decrease in oxygen intake after the intake of water?  "
354,How long should I wait with eating after an exercise?,I hear sometimes that after running you should wait with eating for 30 or 40 minutes (may be the metabolism is still in fat burning mode?).  What is the reason for this advice? How long exactly should I wait? And is it valid for any food or is e.g. okay to eat a banana after the exercise? 
355,Optimizing 10k finishing time until April 3rd,"Today, I won a ticket to a local 10k (6.2 miles) event and now I would like to participate. I've been casually running for ~5 years in regular intervals (~2x/week), but didn't run for at least 3 months.  In the last 5 years I casually attended this event 3x with a time slightly below an hour. However, this time I'd like to train a lot harder.  My goal would be to run the distance in approximate 50 minutes on April 3rd.  Is this doable? Sorry, I know that's a very fuzzy question. What type of training should I do to minimize the 10.5km time?    There are two similar posts. However, the post below answered my question perfectly.  "
356,Indoor jump rope as a temporary suplement for long distance running?,"Due to very bad smog situation that will last at least couple of weeks, I can't go running outside. I was thinking I could supplement long distance running by some jump rope excercises at home. I am used to running 10km/1 hour regularly. I am not sure what kind of excercies should I do, never tried jump rope before (only as a kid).   HIIT? Or just jump as long as I can?  With running shoes? Or bare feet on yoga mat? I have hard floor Any special requirement for the jump rope?   I have read the following questions and I believe it could work, with proper routine:   What should I look for in a jump rope? What is a jump rope good for? Benefits of jogging/running versus rope skipping  "
357,How should I train for multiple running races simultaneously?,"This year, I'm planning on running a 5k, a 10k, and a half marathon in 2015. The dates of the races other than the 5k haven't been announced yet. However, based on last year's dates, there will be about 2 months (9 weeks or so) between the 5k and the 10k and about 4 months (16 weeks) between the 10k and the half marathon. I'm also planning on moving from a maintenance schedule to a training schedule after the holidays, leaving me with about 12 weeks of training before the 5k.  I completed a 5k last year, and have ran 10k training runs, but never competed at that distance. My official 5k time is 29:32. I'd like to get that down to 25:00 or less. I'd also like to run an official 10k of less than 1:00:00 (hopefully ~55:00) and a half marathon in ~2:30:00, if those times are reasonable.  How should I manage my training? I see four obvious solutions that seem reasonable:   Train for the 5k from leading up to the 5k. Follow a 10k training plan in the 2 months between the 5k and 10k. Follow a half marathon training plan in the 3 months between the 10k and half marathon. Train for a 10k through the 10k. Switch to a more race-friendly schedule the week of the 5k. Train for the half marathon from the end of the 10k through the half marathon. Train for the 5k through the 5k. Follow a half marathon training plan from the 5k until the half marathon. Switch to a more race-friendly schedule on the week of the 10k. Train for the half marathon starting in early January. Switch to a more race-friendly schedule the weeks of the 5k and 10k.   Is one preferable over the others, or conversely, is one a worse idea that should be discounted? "

359,What is the best heart beat range for a 5k training?,"I started to running as a 3 days a week train a month ago, I did a 5k run to know, and my time was 32.30, I want to get it down to 27 by the next race in 2 months. I'm doing 2 heart range trains and 1 pace every week.   I’m not sure what’s the best heart range for me, I'm 20 years old, 90kg about 200pounds, 173cm, when I run my heart go to 180 in an easy pace, and in a sprint it gets to 210. In a calm walk after a run it goes really fast to 140, in 40 seconds or so.  So, is it a good training to sprint every time i can get back to 140? So I stay always in a tough situation. Or should I stay in the 180 with a slow pace?   Ill ad any information as needed, thanks for the help. "
360,Weight loss plateau,"I am desperate. I've always heard that when you hit a plateau you can adjust your workouts or your eating habits. I've done BOTH, and seen absolutely no progress in my weight loss. I started out at an all time high weight of 133, (I am a 5' flat female) and a few weeks ago I managed to get down to a very shaky 126, where I knew I would probably gain back a few lbs in the near future. I was stable at 128 for nearly 3 weeks, and now am back to 132. Here's exactly what I ate today, and this is what I always eat like, (Used to just be more of everything, and I used to eat a LOT of gluten) but lately I've really cut back on amounts in my attempt to lose weight. Everything in my house is made from scratch with very high quality ingredients. I actually wonder if I eat too well.   Brekki:  Oatmeal with honey. (Big breakfast, normally I just have toast)  Lunch brought from home:  cucumber slices  whole strawberries  chicken soup  I haven't had dinner yet, but last night I had the same chicken soup and strawberries.  I haven't been eating any snacks between meals for the last few months, but today I was so furious with the scale I ate two slices of homemade bread and some chocolate. This is the first time I've ever done that. Its also the first gluten I've eaten in a month and now I'm feeling rather sick.  I'm also in such a rotten mood I'm not working out right now, when I usually do for around an hour.  This is a part of my workout from yesterday just to give you a taste of what I like to do:   front squat and weighted lunge 10-9-8-7-6-5-4-3-2-1  2 rounds 250 single unders   modified WOD 5 rounds  30 pushups 40 butterfly sit ups 50 weighted squats  I also did a glute and arm workout. This was an easy day. I think that I work out HARD.  What the @#$% is wrong with me??? I've worked out for years, not with the intent to lose weight, mainly in training for track, and never lost weight from any of that. Am I just destined to be one weight? I don't even think I've been changing my body consistency. No muscle gains or anything. Actually maybe a little bit in my arms, and maybe if I'm lucky, I'm seeing something in my stomach. I don't want to look like a supermodel (Gross) I just want to be happy with my body.  My mom said I was fat, sparking all of this @#$$.  "
361,What is the minimum amount of time someone might need for muscles to recover?,"I know there have been answers to this question, but I'm looking for something specific.   The workout has just been completed. Now, what is the minimum amount of time required for the muscle group trained to complete the recovery and the supercompensation phase? Have there been any studies on this, not just images from another website? Is it theoretically possible for a muscle group to complete the recovery and the supercompensation phase in as little as several hours, or overnight? Are there physical symptoms to look out for? "
362,"To deep-heat or to deep-freeze, that is the question","After triggering a long term calf-muscle injuring in my leg during a recent run, I went to my local pharmacy to get some deep heat to apply to it whilst waiting for the doctors to squeeze me in.  However, both deep-heat and deep-freeze were available for purchase; both offering seemingly the same promise of easing muscle soreness and I wasn't sure which one was best to apply in this situation.  Is there a good rule of thumb as to whether to apply a freeze or heat solution?  I.e. is it the case that cold solutions should be applied to injuries and heat solutions are merely there to relax sore/ aching (but un-injured) muscles (or something similar?) "
363,What are good all-round core exercises,So after a dieting period I'm switching back to eating healthy but in larger quantities (bulking).   What would be good all-round exercises to do all week round?   I work out 4 days a week so could I do the same exercises everyday and still train most of my core muscles? I'm still doing 'regular' fitness (weights) but also cardio combined with my core exercises so its not purely core.   What would be good core exercises to do both in the gym and at home? 
364,Do I need to compensate for calories spent exercising on a day to day basis?,"I have recently started getting into shape, mainly by counting calories at MyFitnessPal and getting more serious about my road cycling hobby. I'm in my late twenties and otherwise relatively fit, but need to lose about 25kg to reach my ideal weight.   Because I have so much weight to lose, I've aimed for quite agressive goal of 1kg per week. MyFitnessPal tells me I should eat 1000kcal below my calorie consumption daily. On a day when I don't exercise this means 1540kcal, but as I excercise more I get to eat more, and end up eating anywhere between 1500 and 2500 kcal on most days, thus compensating for the spent calories and hovering around the 1000kcal net deficit, +/-200kcal or so. This works fine for me and I am losing weight.  But then there is the odd day when I either go for a longer endurance ride, or I miss a meal for some reason, and my net calorie deficit can drop drastically. For instance today I cycled for 4 hours at an average speed of 27km/h. MyFitnessPal tells me that at my weight, 4 hours of ""vigorous"" cycling spends 4000 calories, but that sounds to high to me, so I opt for the lower category of ""moderate"" which gives me 3200. Add to that my 1540 base calories and that means I should eat 4740kcal today.  So far I've managed about 3000 (breakfast, lunch, dinner plus carb loading during the ride) and I feel perfectly fine. Am I really supposed to go ahead and make myself eat 1740 more?   This happens to me on average once a week. On the other hand, once I week I have a ""cheat day"" when I might go to the pub and eat at a restaurant, which puts me well over that day's calorie limit.  Am I hurting my weight loss by not sticking to my minimum intake on a day to day basis? Am I hurting myself? Or does it all even out in the long run?  There is a lot of mixed information about this online (""starvation mode"", lowered metabolism, losing muscle, etc.), but I can't find anything that's based on any reliable sources.  "
365,"Exercises/training techniques to improve back posture during deadlifts, cleans, etc","I have recently gotten into olympic lifting and am really enjoying it. Unfortunately, I am repeatedly told by the coaches that my shoulders are rounding forward and my back is not straight when I clean, deadlift or snatch.  I try and focus on it each lift, but I don't seem to be able to keep it straight. My standing posture is okay, and I can stay upright just fine doing squats, but when I am in the initial bent-over position, I fold.  Does anyone have suggestions for exercises or training techniques that can help improve my ability to keep my back straight during these lifts? Perhaps strengthening my upper and lower back while improving flexibility? "
366,Is it my grip or is it the bar?,"I have 200 lb. hand gripper which is very accurate. I can close these grippers for about 2 reps perfectly -- and don't cheat using the other hand to ""set"" it. In general, my hands are stronger than the majority of men my age -- 25. I can close it with both hands, which should say something about my grip.  This last week I visited a YouFit and attempted to deadlift a low 225 lbs. I have been ""off"" deadlifting for years, but knew I could at least hit it once -- and I did.  Problem? The bar seems incredibly hard to hold on to. Surprised me since, well, read above. It makes no sense that I could rep a 200 lb. gripper but have trouble holding on to 25 lbs. more with BOTH hands. The bar felts loose when I was grabbing it and it kept spinning in place (meaning the inner-bar rotates constantly without the weights moving). The bar was a standard 45 lb. bar -- no fat grip or such. I only tried that one bar in the gym, though there were plenty more.  On squats I didn't notice this issue of the bar rolling. Again, I highly doubt it's my grip at all. I have a ""tight"" bar at home which does not roll/rotate upon grabbing and have pulled close to the weight at the gym with my bar with ONE hand and it was barely as difficult as the gym's bar with two.  Is it me or is it the bar? Am I seriously in another dimension here or something?  Also, the weights were hex if that matters. To give a better visual description, I drew a pic of what I mean:    My first assumption was that I got a bad bar -- but is this a ""thing"" or no? Are olympic bars like this? I've always deadlifted with the bar I have at home -- a  hollow, slightly bent, thin bar that holds about 225 lbs. max. Obviously the guys who complain of gripping in deadlift and such tend to possibly, legitimately have grip issues -- but I have credentials with grip and lots of training: with support, pinch and crush for years. I could deadlift this weight with one hand on a ""stiff"" bar that doesn't rotate constantly as you pull, but on the bar I had, it was tough with two hands to pull 225 -- even a tiny bit tough with just 185 as well. What gives? "
367,How does sleep affect your workouts?,"Are there any documented studies that show how sleep effects your workouts or athletic performance?    It would seem that more sleep would help and less sleep would hinder performance, but that's just an educated guess.  Is there anything out there that documents this or counters this?? "
368,Movement for Good Morning vs. RDL,"I'm rehabbing a pulled hamstring, so I'm doing weight lifting for the first time, on the instructions of the physio.  She has me doing both ""Good Mornings"" and ""Romanian Deadlifts"".  It seems like the action in both of these is exactly the same? (except the arms/ upper body, obviously?) Should it be exactly the same action? Or is my technique wrong for one or the other?  Assuming that it is the same action, then I assume that the different position of the weight changes the biomechanics of the action, thus putting stress into different muscles / different parts of the same muscle / etc. "
369,How often can one do a calisthenics workout?,"I was just exposed to Calisthenics and I loved what these people could do on the pull up bar. I researched and found out a few routines for the beginners and would like to start up with them. However there was no mention of how frequently these routines should be done.  I am no beginner to the Gym. Have been around for a long time. I have been doing SS routine for more then a year consistently and doing a lot of schedules and stuff for years before that. I am 6ft 1 Inches and weight 210 pounds and am happy with my size and strength. I have no plans to grow any bigger. My current lifts are close to 200 pounds and I am happy with that too, don't want to get any stronger either. My basic idea is I love working out so I think Calisthenic will add good variety.  I read some where that these workouts can be done 6 days a week. Please let me know what would be a good frequency ?? also what is a good place to learn more about the same.  The routine for a beginner looks like below:   Pull-ups  Inverted rows  Dips  Push-ups  Squats   Do 3 sets per each exercise and 5 sets of squats, doing as many repetitions as you can.  thanks. "
370,Zoning out in and outside of practice,"I'm a swimmer and fairly into the sport, I guess. I'm not currently swimming right now, but would be if it weren't for this problem. During practice, I sort of zone out. Usually not ""in the zone"" kind off zoned out (I think), but just more my mind is not really in the pool with me. I mean, I'm focused on trying hard n' such, but just zoned out.  That in and of itself isn't really my problem. Though it is a little bit annoying, I'm not sure I can say there's anything else better (I know its going to be hard one way or another) and I can't quite remember any other way. My problem is after practice, when my thoughts don't really come back to reality. Its hard to focus on stuff.  Zoning out in practice helps distract me from how hard practice is, but my mind doesn't stop when its over. Its like I never quite get in to the zone, but never really get all the way out, either. I've been out of swimming for a few months now. It's gotten better, but I still tend to focus inward. It sounds a little like depersonalization.  My question is: How can I leave my training in the pool, and focus on my regular life?  Has anyone else dealt with this problem of becoming really introverted? "
371,Deadlifting during and after MCL class Ii,I have not done a squat or a deadlift in close to 4 weeks.  I overtrained and hurt MCL- based on what I read online I think it was a class II tear. I haven't had any pain for my re than a week. If I body weight squat I do feel a little discomfort. My questions would be the following:   Should I wrap my knees during squat and deadlift? What is an optimal foot position for relieving sheer force on the mcl?   
372,Will a vegan diet help for weight loss and physique?,"Some people say that vegan food is good for health, but is it good for bodybuilding and weight loss?  As an additional wrinkle, although I am not diabetic, my family has a history of diabetes so I am willing to adopt a suitable lifestyle. I understand that in this case some vegan foods like potatoes are restricted. Will eating a vegan and diabetic-friendly diet help me with my physique? "
373,Why is body mass index so widely used to determine ideal body weight?,"Given the fact that it doesn’t distinguish between lean body weight and fat weight, why is body mass index so widely used to determine ideal body weight?  When I started seriously exercising a number of years ago (lifting weights and cardio), I gained 20+ pounds and dropped 2 waist sizes in my pants. I'm not muscle bound, but do have a lot more muscle now then when I started. According the BMI chart for my height and weight, I'm borderline obese, yet in reality I'm quite fit. At an annual physical my doctor pulled out the BMI chart, looked at me again and said ""well, that obviously doesn't work for you.""  What's a better way to measure/guage fitness or appropriate weight? Is it solely by measuring % of body fat? "
374,Could not work out for 3 months due to injury.....Any suggestions?,"I had to take a break from working out for 3 months due to Trapezitis(inflammation of Trapezius muscle).  While resuming after a long break, what precautions do I need to take so that I won't encounter the same problem(Trapezitis) again??  Do I need to avoid/add any exercises to get rid of Trapezitis??  Thank you. "
375,"For better muscle growth, how many hours' sleep are recommended after doing a workout?",I heard to help muscle growth one has to sleep a lot after doing a workout. How long is the recommended one? Does this mean the best time to workout is at night so you can go to sleep immediately after? 
376,How worried should I be about overexertion?,"I'm fairly young (about 30), and I ride my bike almost every day (commuting) and try to push myself, so I'm in decent shape. I also like to do longer rides, which involve riding steep roads up a nearby mountain. Even in my granny gear, the roads are steep and long enough to get my heart rate very high. I don't know exactly how high because I don't have a heart rate monitor, but it's high enough that I absolutely have to stop along the way.  Should I be concerned about overexertion? If so, are there any signs in particular I should look out for? I just want to make sure to avoid dangerous activity. If you're in good shape, is it safe to exert yourself as much as you're able to? "
377,How do I know how much running in football is safe for me?,"Football can require quite a lot of running. Sometimes after exceptionally intense moments I find myself briefly unable to satiate the need for breathing, at which point I wonder if I’m doing something that’s potentially unsafe for myself. My heart rate can stay above 200 during such episodes (though I’ve only measured it a couple of times), which is above the ""standard"" maximum effort for my age (28), but I feel fine apart from being rather out of breath – which is surely to be expected from lots of running.  How do I know when it’s time to slow down? Can I ""run till I drop"", figuratively speaking, for as long as I feel OK? I am not aware of any medical issues that might subject me to extra risk. "
378,Cardio before or after exercise?,I usually do a 10-20 mins Cardio (Treadmill/Elliptical/Cycling) before I go for the weights and other exercises. Is this a good practice? Would there be any advantages if I order my routine differently?  
379,What is a bodyweight-only strength workout with a few compound exercises?,"Today's paradigm seems to be the Reg Park workouts in different flavours, like Starting Strength and StrongLifts 5x5. A few compound exercises with free weights, using barbells, as opposed to the 80's fever of specialised machines and crazy complex workouts combining lots of isolating exercises that confused the beginner.  I would like to see a bodyweight-only routine that follows analogous principles, thus using only a few compound exercises. I can imagine something like:   Squats (with no weight) Push-Ups Dips between two chairs (?) Chin-Ups if you have somewhere to hang from. If not, what?   What more? Specially for shoulders, I can imagine there is some work with the Indian Push-Ups, but ?  Ok, strength training is done with barbells or dumbbells, but if you can barely perform one or two push-ups at the beginning, and add a few each week, nobody would doubt that you are gaining strength. Eventually a point will be achieved in which you are able to perform, say, thirty of them. After that, I agree that going for more means you are training for endurance and not strength.  This might be useful too for advanced trainees, merely as a program to help maintaining form during a holidays travel or similar.  (yes, starting with the barbell alone in a 5x5 program will lead you to strength gains too, and yes, long live Mark Rippetoe! Ok, but that is not the question) "
380,Does adding an extra set constitute as progressive overload?,"I understand that in order to get results out of a workout one must invoke progress overload into the workout. One way of doing this is to have less rest time, and another way is to increase the amount of weight being lifted. My question is though, if say i do 2 sets of bicep curls with 25 lbs dumbbells for seven reps is there any benefit of doing another set or is it simply better to go up in weight or cut my rest time? Some things i feel i should point out to help you answer. Firstly my barometer to know when its time to go up in weight is when i can do 7 reps on my last set (i know some of you may do more reps per set before increasing weight, but i am currently trying to get stronger hence the low rep range). Another thing i should point out is that i do not only do 2 sets of bicep curls i also do 2 sets of hammer curls for a total of 4 sets. With that in mind is there any benefit to adding another set? "
381,Rationale behind Rep Range recommendations - Strength vs Hypertrophy,"It makes no sense to me why the rep range for “hypertrophy” and body builders is according to NSCA and many other sources is 3 sets and 10-12 reps.    At the most basic level cross bridges formation determines strength, hypertrophy (muscle size), cross-sectional area and force are all and direct related.    So in theory current training recommendations for strength such as 5 x 5's would lead to a greater increase in both size and hypertrophy.   Assuming all major factors to be equal (diet, rest, volume load etc.) How does that recommendation make sense?  What am I missing?   (Related research is always a huge plus) – thanks!    UPDATE: Just read that study. He definitely makes some great points. The article is literally what quite a number of strength training foundations are based on.     HOWEVER -- he draws some very BROAD conclusions and at times   selectively uses one way data to provide single sided explanations to   support what have been adopted as industry standards.  IMO crazy we place so    much weight on certain aspects of his findings....     UPDATE #2 The 3-5 min just provides more recovery time so you're moving more weight per rep and avoiding muscular endurance training (nothing too earth shattering) - glycogen obviously is replenished to a greater degree the longer you rest.    The study below talks about the same range for power.  No study would be complete if it did end by contradicting itself -- 30-60 sec is best if according to the last paragraph.  I guess it's too idealistic to expect a clear rep range (there are too many factors to take into account).  I also don't agree with their recommendation to rest 3-5 min for power in favor of a shorter rest time.  If it's used for sport specific training, not exactly a realistic timeframe to rest vs game scenarios.  Even in a general sense; to me power based training make the most sense as a mix b/n endurance and power (for efficiency etc).  [website]"
382,How can I improve my running form?,"I know my form isn't terrible, but it certainly isn't perfect either. How do you work on improving it? Are there certain exercises that will strengthen the right muscles and force better form? Do you concentrate on footfall while running? "
383,Dumbbell weight training for distance running,What weight training exercises can I do with dumbbells that will benefit me most for running 5-10ks? Are stomach crunches/sit ups worth doing too? 
384,"If I can't get plenty of sleep, should I be doing anything different when trying to put on mass?","Getting plenty of sleep is really important for putting on size - something I am very aware of.  Unfortunately, various circumstances lead to me not being able to get to the gym until about 9:30PM at night. I work out for about an hour to an hour and a half depending on the day, and then begin a journey home which takes about 1 hour. I need to wake up the next morning at 6:30AM for work.  Taking in to account up to an additional hour of overflow (time it takes to fall asleep, have a quick shower before I get to bed etc), this leaves me about 5-6 hours for actual sleep. Obviously this is not great company for weight training.  Is there anything I can do to maximise my gains with restricted sleep?   Will going easier on myself in my training benefit me in this case because of reduced recovery time? Should I try get as many hours sleep over the weekend as I can? Maybe I should leave legs or back until Friday where I get a massive sleep the following morning (because of the weekend)? Should I restrict myself to a single muscle group a day rather than two? etc  "
385,Is my current strength building workout good to start off with?,"So I'm about 6 feet tall (183 cm) and weigh about 180lbs (75kgs). I'm looking to get a more toned stomach and gain more strength in my arms.  I don't want huge muscles, I just want to get to a more basic level of strength as I realized I am a lot weaker than my peers.  After asking other questions about how best to gain strength without gaining a lot of mass, I have started doing a workout each day.  In the morning I do 10 situps. This is just to try and get my stomach/abdomen in a better shape and remove the ever so slight flab I have developed.  Later on I do 3 sets of lifting a dumbbell 10 times, weighing 15lbs for each arm. I have about a 20 minute break between each set of lifting 10 times(is each set a rep?).  Is this a good starting point towards my goals? Should I be incorporating further exercises? Should I do more or less reps? Or is it OK for the moment while I am starting out? "
386,"High testosterone, but can't get muscular or ripped easily?","I started on a long journey from being almost morbidly obese with test around 320 ng/dl to where I am now -- lean, 13-14% bodyfat and test recorded at 800 -- highest ever record for myself early in the morning. I have noticed zero difference from having 320 and 800 when it comes to muscle building. For example, weightlifting at a low test level showed the same timeframe and gains as they do now with a higher one. I workout religiously and do everything right -- but I build muscle painfully slow -- less than 6 pounds a year -- and highly inconsisent results (strong as hell one week -- very weak the next). For example, I could bench 315 2 times less than a month go -- now I struggle to do 275 twice. I get excellent rest and never feel tired or fatigued -- I just poorly build muscle it seems. I figured higher testosterone would make a massive difference, but it doesn't -- at least not for me. A near 500 ng/dl increase and virtually no difference in protein synthesis/etc. I recover very quickly, big there's never much mass. I get unbelievable pumps, but after 1-2 days I go back to normal size. My arms have been stuck at 13.5 inches for 2 years even though I've added 10-15 lbs. to my biceps curls in that timeframe. I at first assumed ""genetics"" but all steroid users take high test and they easily gain size -- so I figured naturally increasing my testosterone would work the same -- just at a lower level. I've noticed my jawline is prominent -- I have an incredibly high libido -- my self-esteem has improved -- everything basically. I did not need TRT like a beta male and I'm definitely an alpha male -- I just can't look like the ideal one with muscularity.  Do I just accept genetics? Do I keep trying to up my testosterone naturally? I can re-evaluate diet and rest more or try and have sex more and fight (all things that supposedly increase testosterone).  I just wish I could look like the ideal alpha male when it comes to muscle. I look too small for my leanness and I'm trying to get ripped, but I can't put on much size even in a surplus for months. I gave up bulking when I just got fat and DEXA scans show virtually no change in muscle mass over months of steadily checking while bulking. I just do a steady re-comp and try to lose/gain now, but it seems I can keep losing fat but barely put on muscle, bulking or not. What are my options?  At my current musculature I'll look like a puny marathon runner or cyclist at ripped status.  I'm trying to get (something like) this body type, but with a little lower bodyfat naturally:    Can genetics let me succeed? Can I break any genetic limitations I may have without drugs?   Is it possible? "
387,Does bodybuilding make you shorter?,"When you lift a lot your intervertebral disks get smaller because of the pressure and destruction caused be too much pressure. Also, you loose the body fat surrounding many of your organs and the fat under the skin e.g. in your feet (bottom part).  Is this the reason that extreme bodybuilding make you shorter in the end?   Or are there other factors that compensate this lose caused by damaged intervertebral disks and fat loose? "
388,"Adding a 4th day, how to alter my current routine?","78kg, 1.86m, male, skinnyfat    I've recently started training more serious again (been working out twice a week for the past 6 months). Now I'm aiming for 4 times a week.  My goal is to reduce my fat percentage so my abs will show again (became skinny fat) while not losing any/much muscle.  The gym I'm currently going printed out a quite basic 3-split hypertrophy routine, since I was training 3 times a week then. Their philosophy is:  ""Gain muscle, up your metabolism, eat less calories than you burn.""   Day 1 (Mon): Chest, Triceps, bit of abs Day 2 (Tue): Back, Biceps, bit of abs Day 3 (Wed): Legs, Shoulders, bit of abs   I want to pick up the Thursday, Day 4. Now I'm asking myself if I should continue my current routine but not be bothered by the 7-day span, so if I would continue with the previous list:   Day 4 (Thu): Chest, Triceps, bit of abs Day 5 (Mon): Back, Biceps, bit of abs etc.   Or would a 2-split be better? Or f.e. 4th day cardio?  edit  Chest/triceps:   Bench press Incline dumbell press Dumbell fly Fly (machine) Cable fly Triceps pushdown Rope pulldown Over the head pull   Back/Biceps   Straight bar pulldown Machine row Cable row Biceps machine (preacher idea) Hammer curl Bar curl   Shoulders/Legs   Squats Leg press Hamstring curl Leg extensions Calves extension (not sure what the name is) Shoulder press Lateral raise Front raise Back fly   And the 'bit of abs' consists usually of some situps, leg raises and some rotation to hit the obliques.  "
389,How do I get over my fear of sport after experiencing (witnessing) an injury?,"I am a college student. I was playing football until a few months ago. When I was playing football my body was fit and fine. Also I had good stamina.  One day I saw a football accident clip on the internet. Since then I have been afraid of playing football. It has been more than 6 months now, and my body has lost its shape and I am losing my stamina. Honestly I dont want to walk away from football as I love this game and also it helps me to be in shape and fit.  How can I resume football? Is there any other option to stay fit and in shape? Please dont tell me to go to a gym. We dont have a gym facility in our college, and I cant afford an outside gym. "
390,Carrying a child out of a pram (back pain),"Working with toddlers, my girlfriend has to lift them in and out of various kinds of prams. That has led to lower back problems for her since the common lifting advice do not apply for all prams. In the case of some strollers, she can lift the kid without bending forward. However, in other cases that does not work.  What is the proper lifting technique in lifting a toddler in or out of a pram? Or, would you guys rather recommend some back exercises for her to get rid of her back pain? "
391,Side laying flexion: what muscles worked?,"I had a case of shoulder impingement a while back and it got 85–90% better with physio, but then found this exercise online which appears to be helping to finish my recovery:    It really feels like it's doing the trick... but I'm just wondering what muscles it's actually working?  I presume it targets around the rotator cuff? "
392,Eating not right -gain muscles or no,"Eating right has many advantages on our health and can help building muscles. On the other hand fast foods, sugar etc. are detrimental for gaining muscles. What is the reason for this? If a thin guy or normal body fat like me starts eating badly he will increase his body fat. As a result he will obtain obvious muscles faster than someone who is trying to eat healthy.  I'm talking about someone who eats fast food, etc. but takes protein meals in their program.  Will the guy who eats badly for a small period of time have a greater success than a guy who is eating healthy? Compare same workouts but different food. (For example three meals of beans versus three meals of fast food.) "
393,Why is one sleepy/tired after playing basketball but not after running?,"One may sleep very well last night. But after playing basketball(40 minutes, mild), he may become very sleepy.  That is probably because his brain needs more oxygen. But why is he much better after running 5 miles quickly? Running seems more sensitive to oxygen and it depletes more calories.   How to reduce the level of fatigue after playing basketball? "
394,Are squats with dumbbells as effective as squats with barbells?,"I was wondering, if I were to use the same amount of weight with dumbbells as I would with a barbell while doing a squat, will I get the same benefits as I would using a barbell?   Now I understand that one of the obvious benefits with barbells, is the fact that I can use massive weight, weight that would be extremely difficult to use with dumbbells - but that is why I am asking about the case where I am using the same amount of weight. In other words is there a difference as to whether I have the weight by my side with the dumbbells, or across my shoulders with the barbell? "
395,What factors affect underwater swimming endurance and how to improve it?,"I have a good 45 minute cardiovascular workout just before swimming. Although I’ve got my breath back when I go in I imagine my body is still depleted in some way?  What factors affect my (or anyone’s) ability to conduct sustained swimming under water? And what can I do to improve my performance? Is the change in performance more likely to be due to age or to the prior cardiovascular workout?  Edit  A little back ground I’m now 57 and I do an hour’s cardio workout of quite vigorous intensity twice a week with heart rate up to 170 bpm for the last 5 years. I also play short tennis once a week and do a reasonable amount of walking. So I’m active and reasonably fit. In my early forties I was doing a desk job, didn’t go to the gym and was not that fit, but I was still able to swim a 25m length under water (just) most of the time that I really tried. Now I find that I can only do 20m before coming up for air. That said I swim after going to the gym so I’m not “fresh”, although my breathing has returned to normal when I’m in the pool.  I suppose what I should do is try the swimming first as a proper comparative test for myself, age v fitness. But this made me wonder what factors would affect my performance. Some things I have noticed are that hyperventilating (but not going to mad!) seems to help so perhaps not being fresh is important, as I have only ever been able to do the underwater length once per pool visit, but I’m not sure why?  Update - I am now able to swim this under water length without difficulty provided I spend 7 minutes breathing quickly before trying. Not enough to make me feel dizzy but the blood must be well oxygenated. "
396,Intermittent fasting and lifting?,"I love intermittent fasting and I lift a fair amount. I often lift a few hours after eating and then fast for another 18hrs or so. Conventional wisdom says this isn't too bright, but I have continued to see muscle gain.  Has anyone else experimented with this routine? Has he/she found muscle gain a problem? "
397,Been sick with flu almost for a month - how deep is fall,"I haven't been in gym since 11 of the August because of some complicated flue/cold + tonsillitis I got.  All stuff I do I do naturally, so, basically, here is some of my excercise info was like that before illness:  - 62.5 kg barbell bench press (3 * 10 times)  - Chin ups (with 5kg weight in additional) (3 * 10 times)  - 70kg deadlift (3 * 10)  - 130kg (3 * 15) leg press  Throught my ilness sometimes I've visited friends and office, but no any hard load. Temperature most of the time was normal but it was like 37.5 last 3 days (when I get my tonsillitis, yeah)  So, what do you think guys, how long should I train to get all back? How deep is fall after such hard flu? "
398,Suggestions for bedroom exercises,"At night I do sit-ups and push-ups. It started as something to knock me out, if I needed to sleep but wasn't tired, a few of each would tire me out.  As time passes I am able to do more before I get tired, and I don't find them a chore so much. Now I'm wandering what other exercises I can do at night just in my bedroom that don't require any equipment like sit-ups and push-ups?  These two are obvious ones that we all know, but what other exercises can I do? I don't have any specific goal like weight loss, or body building, just something that's good for me I can do at night.

399,Are 5x5 or Starting Strength Beginner Programs (That Shouldn't be Used Indefinitely)?,"Essentially, what the title says - are there programs targeted at beginners, or could you do these forever and still see good progress?  Or are there better programs once you have been lifting for years? Should I be doing a 5-day split or something? Is there anything established to do as as an ""Intermediate lifter"" (as judged by exrx Strength Standards)?     This is just the program I am talking about if anyone is unfamiliar, Starting Strength is similar.  The StrongLifts 5×5 Routine: Day A: Squat: 5×5 Bench: 5×5 Deadlift: 1×5  Day B: Squat: 5×5 Press: 5×5 Barbell Row: 5×5  StrongLifts Two Week Cycle: Mon: Day “A” Wed: Day “B” Fri: Day “A” Mon: Day “B” Wed: Day “A” Fri: Day “B”  "
400,Will drinking alchohol and smoking cigarettes inhibits muscle growth?,"I've a few questions regarding the alcohol consumption, smoking and body building.  About me:    5'5"", 136 lbs. Undergoing a hard weight gaining program at gym at evening. Drinking Serious Mass two scoops per day a mass gain supplement. One between meals and another one before going to sleep. And I'm pretty sure that I'm eating more and heavy than what I spend since I don't let me feel hungry all the day.   Questions:   If I drink a couple of beers on the rest day(mostly the Sunday in my case) or a 2-3 drinks of alcohol on any one of the days(for a party), will it affect my protein synthesis or muscle growth? If I smoke 3 to 4 cigarettes a day but not at-least 2 hours before I hit the gym. What would be the effect?  "
401,How to do HIIT when it takes a while for the treadmill to speed up and slow down?,"I am interested in starting a HIIT regimen to maximize my fat loss but the issue I am having is that it takes a while for the treadmill to speed up and slow down. I am trying to start by doing 30 second sprints going at 9-10 miles per hour followed by 30 second slow jogs/walks going at 3-4 miles per hour but the treadmills at my gym take about 10-15 seconds to speed up and slow down from those speeds, meaning I cant have the full 30 seconds of sustained sprinting or restful walking.   What should I do to make this work? How to you guys factor in how long it takes the treadmill to speed up and slow down? "
402,How do I keep my body warm between intermittent workouts?,"Every year, I participate in a martial arts tournament that takes place in an air-conditioned grand ballroom of a hotel. The way the tournament works is that people are split into several divisions (by age, skill level, style, sex, etc.) which are held throughout the day. There number of people in a division can vary, and the scheduling (though continuous) can be fragmented for an individual participant.  What my problem is that when I participate in these competitions, I am usually not warmed up enough to the point where I am most physically capable (something I feel in terms of flexibility). The number of participants in the divisions I participate in can reach upwards of 20 people (at least) while the actual martial demonstration might span anywhere from 30 seconds to 2 minutes.  Because of the enormous amounts of waiting involved in this tournament and the cooling air temperature in the hotel, my body is terribly stiff for every performance I do and not as good as it could be. Though I can warm up my body before starting the competition, it is not so easy to simply walk away in the middle of a division (unless you're doing multiple divisions that conflict and are running back and forth). Everyone typically stays in place until it is over.  Given the fragmentation of the physical expenditures and the air temperature around me, are there exercises that will help me in this situation? What effect will the intensity and duration of such exercises have on keeping my core temperature warm?  For reference, what I wear is a silk suit which is not the most breathable fabric. It's very thin and light. In addition to warm-ups, will athletic clothing help in any way? "
403,Twitching after Intense Workouts,"I do high intensity training to build mass. I usually get muscle twitching after a hardcore training session. Usually in my Glutes, Triceps, Shoulders, Chest and Quads. I am genetically more gifted with my shoulders and back - but I have never gotten any muscle twitching in my back.  My last training was a shoulder training composed of several supersets. My shoulders were so pumped it felt as if lactic acid was going to ooze out of them. About four hours after my training my anterior deltoid started twitching. It has been doing this for about 18 hours now and almost prevented me from sleeping.  I don't think it's related to stretching because I stretch a lot (I'm a male and can do the splits easily). I'm extremely flexible and use great caution when stretching and lifting. I prefer quality over quantity.  What makes the muscle twitch? Does it mean it is overworked? "
404,"Is this ""Cardiac diet"" a healthy way to lose weight?","I read that this diet is potentially dangerous and I wanted some feedback before I continue.  I read that it is dangerous due to the super low calorie intake and the types of foods involved; basically amounting to you starving yourself.    Is this true?  I don't know much about nutritional safety or diets- probably why I'm overweight and need to diet : )  This is the diet.  The basic idea is that you eat only fruit, vegetables and a specific soup that contains vegetables, beef broth and seasonings.  Its very regimented (eat only soup and fruit on monday, eat soup and veggies on tuesday, etc) and it also has a few extras throughout the week (you can have one baked potato with butter on tuesday, you can have steak on thursday, etc.)    The diet says anytime that you are hungry to eat the soup.  You can have as much soup and either veggies or fruit, depending on the day, as you want.  If this diet is unhealthy, why is it unhealthy?  What is it about these combination of foods that don't nourish the body? "

406,Interval of time and Conditions for doing push ups and strength training?,"Is it necessary that our body be warmed up before doing push ups? (Condition) Is it OK to do strength exercise (mainly push ups) every 2-3 hours? (Definitely not just after and before eating, but do it whenever I get the chance)  Scenarios:   Suppose I'm studying in my room and after 2 hours, I need to give myself some rest from studying, so I switch to stretching, push ups, plank, dumbbells, sit ups, hand gripper. Is it OK to do so? Is it OK to use a hand gripper during a boring class?   I'm not a native English speaker, so please excuse my English and my inability to formulate the question properly. "
407,General regime to increase running stamina and avoid aggravating back injury,"Some time ago I injured my lower back, I believe at the time the physiotherapist I saw referred to it as a ""l4/l5 disc bulge"" and also seems to have caused a bit of sciatica.  The injury slowly cleared hence I stopped seeing the physiotherapist, but it has recently recurred.  In order to help strengthen my body in general and help my back in the long term as the physio recommended exercise and slowly strengthening the lower back to relieve the pain I have taken up going to the gym.  At the moment my regime mainly involves the following:   Fast walk/Jog (6kp/h) for ~20 minutes Recumbent exercise bike, ~20-30 minutes Shoulder Press Machine (upper body only)   I have also been doing some work using an exercise ball to flex my lower back without putting too much stress on it.  So far I have managed to avoid making the pain any worse and in fact the pain has lessened a good deal.  Keeping it loose and mobile seems to be of benefit for my particular injury.  What I want is to increase my running stamina so that I can run/jog for longer periods without causing undue stress on my lower back.  I would like to be able to get up to ~10 miles run/jog within 6 months.  Is there any other (preferrably gym based) methods for increasing my stamina and overall body strength without causing problems?  Would a back brace or similar help at all? "
408,Balancing barbell with turkish getup or alternative?,"I only started this a few weeks ago, so who am I to talk:  I'm currently doing a TGU with a 30kg dumbbell, which is the heavist dumbbell around. Hence, today I used a straight and quite short barbell and a curlbar to do the TGU, but balancing the weight was my main issue. The bar tilts back and forth and my wrist has very little power in comparison to the weights at each end.  Is using barbells (curlbar better?) the natural progession in this exercise? If yes, how do you balance the weight? I can't find any tutorial on this. There are no kettlebells in the gym. I can't move to the olympic barbells because the gym is not big enough to securely swing that thing around without smashing someone's head.   Did you use less weight at the beginning for the barbell, or is this only required while figuring out the balance issue? "
409,How does calorie burn affect appetite?,"What's the relationship of calories burned (e.g. through exercise) and appetite level?  Let's say there are two hypothetical situations:  A) Over the course of one day my body burns 2300 calories but I only eat 1800 calories worth of food. Some of the calorie burn is from a mild amount of cardio.  B) I try to be more active and burn 2800 calories throughout the day but I eat 2300 calories worth of food.  Assuming the same balance of protein/carbs/fats/etc between both diets, do I feel more hungry in scenario A than B?  Perhaps another question in itself: will I lose the same amount of body fat in both scenarios? "
410,Lose weight at home?,"I have a question that's been runnin round my mind for a while now.....

411,Mixed versus overhand grip on deadlifts?,"Whenever I see instructional videos on standard deadlifts, the lifter is using either mixed grip or overhand grip; however they never go on to differentiate why they are using that particular grip or the pros/cons that come with each.  What is the primary difference in mixed grip vs overhand? Are there pros/cons to each grip? Is one particularly better than the other? "

I went to gym for gaining muscle in 2011 and my progress was very slow, after couple of months continuing gym, I left it.  For last six months my lower belly is getting big. And I am feeling weak now a days.  I want to gain some weight with mass and want to loose my belly fat(its look really odd).  I have read couple of fitness blogs they suggest to go to gym and do weight training. But now its not possible for me to go to a gym(nearest gym is far away from home and I dont have much time to go there).  What I can do, I can buy light(cheap) instruments and also can arrange better food. And I can do some home exercise.  Do you guys have any specific suggestions?

416,I feel no burn from the bench press,"I've been lifting on and off for years, and recently have returned to it. However the bench press has always been an exercise in which I encounter very little payoff or progress. Whenever I get a good workout in, I feel a good soreness (at least slightly) in the muscle group of concentration, but this never happens with bench press. Whether I lift as much as I can with a spot, or if I do a more hypertrophic routine with less weight and more reps, I never feel sore in my chest the next day. Subsequently, I make very little progress being able to add more weight as I go.   On the press machine, I feel it. Doing pushups, I feel it. I've had trainers before who say my form is fine, and they are left scratching their heads about my progress. Has anyone ever experienced anything like this? And is there anything that I can do differently?  Thanks.  Add: If it makes a difference, my arms are long for my body.  "
417,Recovery week is it beneficial for fat loss as well?,"I have read that rest weeks are beneficial for body builders since that extra week of recovery (vs a rest day) helps them gain muscle by constituting the healing process the muscle requires, is the same thing applicable to people who are going for fat loss?  I have noticed decreasing levels of intensity and all out motivation to work out because of over training, and I was suggested I go on a rest week, would this help me in my fat loss venture? I feel so guilty today since it is day one of my rest week that I want to workout already though I feel like Im so tired. "
418,How to Increase height naturally? Are those ads gimmicks?,"I'm 5'6, weigh 137, male  and close to be 24 soon. I am not happy with my height. I love sports, basketball, soccer, and others.  Being this short have some influence on sport activities I participated especially, on basketball. Because of that reason and some other personal reasons (like my girl friend is taller than me for e.g ..lol) I wanted to increase my height as much and as soon as possible.   I tried one exercise (Grow taller 4 idiots) and I had some back pain after trying it for 3 weeks and then I stopped it. Now, its been a year after I stopped the exercise. But, I am still hopeful that there is a away for me to grow up at least 1-3 inchs. And if I get the right exercise I will take my time and do it even for half year. This much is my eager to be taller because, I saw the effects many times.  Are those advertisements that we see on the web and tv are gimmicks? Is there any other not natural way to increase height without a side effect? Since I also wanted to be physically fit (as you can see i am 136 pound), I want to make sure working dumb bells won't have any effect on increasing height. Should both exercises go together?  FYI: if it has an effect, genetically both my dad and mom are short as well . but I have other relatives like my cousins and uncles who are 6'2.  Thank you. "
419,What is a good training program for a beginner/intermediate mountaineer/rock climber?,"My goal is to use the gym to get in shape for mountaineering and rock climbing on my vacations.  I don't have access to rock walls or mountains so I try and use what I have: a gym, and running routes. I also enjoy running, and the added benefits of a better cardiovascular system, so I want to fit that into my fitness plan as well.   I have lost about 7 kilos in the past three or so months through just general getting in shape. This has included its fair share of strict dieting, as well as weeks of beer drinking (vacations). I currently have some muscle definition but I definitely also still have a layer of fat.  I weigh 78 kilos and am 177.5 cm, and I can't see my abs.    Diet: I eat oatmeal with milk and banana and peanut butter for breakfast.  I have a hard boiled egg at 10 am.  For lunch I eat leafy greens, lentils or flaxseed or peanut butter, occasionally sweet potato, and an apple.  For a snack I have nonfat yogurt and some sunflower seeds before I go to the gym.  For dinner I have more green vegetables, tomatoes, cucumbers, and 2-3 eggs.  I live in Thailand so protein supplements are very expensive and I don't enjoy eating low quality protein (chicken breast) from grocery stores.  My protein is low, but I don't want to be putting on a lot of muscle weight so I don't see it as a major concern.    Training: I do 8-9 exercises with 3 sets of 10 reps.  I have switched between single muscle splits and full body routines - this is a major point where I want suggestions.  I do this 3-4 days a week.  The other 3 are spent running (6 miles) in about an hour, sometimes longer if I am tired. On my cardio days I also work on pullups and body weight core routines.  Occasionally (maybe 1-2 a week) I do HIIT cardio on a treadmill. I also have a problem with hip and ankle flexibility so i regularly stretch.    I am looking to improve my relative strength, and get lean. I want to lose my last layer of fat in the next 12 weeks, while improving/maintaining strength. For strength I am most interested in improving core, pull, and grip strength. I do a pullup regimen of 5 sets every other day with 4 sets of 50% of MR and one set of 80% MR (I can do approximately 10 open hand pullups right now, but I really want this to improve).  I want to know if it is bad to do long cardio 2-3 times a week - will this cause muscle degradation? Also what is the best split for lifting?  How should my strength training and cardio be mixed together? Do I truly need 2 times my body weight in proteins? This just seems unrealistically high, broscience.    Sorry for the length - any suggestions about how to better present my stats would be appreciated.   "
420,Organize meals for morning workout (gaining weight),"I have gone through the thread ""I am underweight. How do I gain weight and muscle?"". I have a few other questions regarding protein supplements and organization of cooking.   How can I organize my meals for a morning workout. ( 7.30am to 8.30am). Should I have something before I hit the gym or just pre-workout shake ?. (If pre workout please suggest what to buy - my objective is to gain weight and I have no knowledge of what protein to buy). Is pre-workout protein different from post workout. Should I have any other protein shakes apart from pre and post workout supplements (like whey). I don't eat MEAT so I have to depend on protein supplements.   PS: Also it will be really great if someone post up reputed online stores to purchase protein so that it can directly ship to my home. It can help a lot of student who can ship stuffs to their school mail box. Its easier to carry it to gym. "
421,Can Climbing stairs lead to good weight loss..?,"I am newly climbing stairs and I clock myself to about 60 minutes of climbing up and down a single floor(2 sets of stairs).

422,Maximum wattage of a fat cell,How fast can fat be burned? I am not asking about how quickly weight can be lost but how much of a human's calorific need can be met by fat alone? Is it healthy to work at the maximum power output of fat for sustained periods? 
423,Good effect of meal size/timing on later mixed workout performance?,"I'm do a mixed workout intended to have both muscle-building and general fitness boosting and want to understand how meal size prior to it affects value of that workout.  Here are the relevant facts:  Workout:  hi reps bench press, pull ups, curls, tri push-downs, capoeira, treadmill running.  Fairly intense, 2 hrs, ~3x/week.  Burn ~1,000 calories, estimated.  Meal timing:  Normally my workout is from ~5:40pm--7:40pm.  I eat no breakfast other than a coffee w/ soymilk (9am) and then have a 500 calorie lunch (noon) and a 200-400 calorie snack later (3pm).  My diet is a little low in protein due to being partially vegetarian, so I powder supplement though not strictly.  New datapoint: However, yesterday, despite having lunch, I attended an afternoon event and rather pigged out on free chicken strips, fruit with cream topping, cheese and crackers, and a macaroon!  I felt somewhat full by 4:30pm and expected my workout to lag due to it.  But, my workout then went very well--I lifted and ran something like personal bests for this time period.  Question:  is there any evidence or conventional wisdom that a well-timed large meal can boost in-gym performance and/or the gains that result from it?  What's known about this? "
424,Runtastic heart rate zones way too high?,"I measured my resting heart rate using the runtastic chest strap and It is 54. I am 27 years old and my current weight is 75 kilograms (165.3 lb).  I used the Formular which according to wikipedia was the least objective to get my max heart rate:  205.8−(0.685×27) = 187.305  With this data Runtastic calculated the following heart rate zones:  Easy: 120 - 132 Fat Burning: 133 - 146 Aerobic: 147 - 159 Anaerobic: 160 - 172 Red Line: 173 - 187  But according to this image on wikipedia which uses the fox and haskell formula, my fat burning rate should be approximately 115 - 135 which is totally incoherent with the zones calculated by runtastic.  What is going on here? I know that it is not possible to say it with absolute precision, but what would my fat burning zone approximately be? "

On a side note, does the Inclination of the feet stand in the ""squat calf machine"" serve for sthg? or is it just a matter of shape/design? "
426,Help with my posture please?,My posture is really bad. I believe that I have upper-cross syndrome. (I think that is what it's called?)  I have searching the web and YouTube but nothing seems to help with my posture. When I do try to sit or stand up straight my back gets sore after a bit. I went to jump america and after about 30 min my back just starts hurting I am not sure if it is about my posture but I'm just saying maybe you guys know something. My bad posture may be giving me really bad headaches and again I am not sure if it is because of my terrible posture.  If you know something that will help tell me? Thanks. 
427,How should I transition into minimalist running shoes?,"I have spent the last few years running in stability shoes with orthotics (Brooks Adrenaline line) to prevent ankle pain caused by overpronation. My joints and muscles are fine after long runs (including one marathon), but I am hesitant to continue running longer distance because the orthotics give me terrible foot pain and blisters during training and actual races.  Two months ago I bought a pair of Five Fingers. I started out slowly, and have gradually worked my way up to about 5 miles in them. I really enjoy running in minimal footwear, but I am limited in mileage because the bottom-center of my foot gets gets tight/exhausted (probably from years of wearing orthotics, right?)  Presently I am starting to train for a marathon (Oct.), and for my longer runs I continue to use my stability shoes. That is, I'm basically running 50% in VFF and 50% in my Brooks Adrenaline.  My thought is to remove the stability shoes from my training soon; I'd probably pick up a replacement pair that will encourage forefoot/midfoot striking, but also provide some support to help during the transition and accommodate overpronation issues. PureConnect or Nike Free, for example.  I'm basically looking for someone to validate this reasoning, or tell me I'm going about this all wrong.    Does it make sense to use shoes with intermediate support for long runs while I'm still breaking in my VFF? Or is there a different approach I should take to transition away from stability shoes and more toward lighter footwear?  "
428,Implications of the fact that resistance bands doesn't provide constant force for pull throughs and in general,"Some time ago I asked a question about how to replace deadlifts with resistance bands: Resistance band deadlifts. One point was that the resistance band doesn't offer a constant resistance but it increases monotonically with the stretching of the band.   Recently I discovered the cable pull through as a safe way to train the posterior chain:      (Image from [website]Now I asked me again whats about resistance band pull throughs. Since the forces are different in the cable version vs. resistance band version (constant force vs. increasing force) one might guess that the muscle activation and thus the training effect is different. On might also ask if one needs to use a modified technique for the resistance bands or if one should add another exercise to get the same effect with the resistance bands as with the cables. Perhaps there is a general answer to those questions without referring to a specific exercise (you can substitute many cable or dumbbell exercises in principle with resistance bands).   So I want to know the following specifically to this exercise and in general:   What does the constant force vs. increasing force fact imply concerning   training effects aiming to build a proper working/functional, healthy muscle system training effects aiming at bodybuilding (i.e. how the results will look like)  are there any technique variations you must have in mind? are there any additional exercises you should to to compensate the shortcomings of the resistance bands?   By asking google I already found this passage from bodylastics which doesn't need to be very objective since it's a resistance band manufacturer:     Another unique benefit of elastic resistance that free weight   resistance does not offer is linear variable resistance. What this   means is that, as the range of motion of the exercise increases, the   resistance provided by the elastic equipment increases. For example,   when doing a biceps curl, as you curl your hand up toward your   shoulder, the resistance of the elastic tubing increases. This is due   to the physical properties of elastic material. As its length   increases (from being stretched), it provides more resistance11. One   of the benefits of this is that as the range of motion increases and   the resistance increases, the number of muscle fibers that are being   used in the exercising muscle increase. The more muscle fibers being   used, the greater the adaptations in muscle strength that can be   achieved with the training program. This benefit is not offered by   free-weight resistance. Another reason linear variable resistance, as   provided by elastic resistance, is beneficial is due to what is known   as the strength curve of muscles. The linear variable resistance   provided by elastic tubing better mimics the strength curves of most   muscles. A strength curve refers to the way a muscle’s or muscle   group’s strength changes over a range of motion. Because of their   anatomy, most muscles increase in strength over the range of motion   until a certain point. Again using the biceps curl as an example, as   you curl the hand toward the shoulder, the muscle gets stronger up   until about the halfway point of the range of motion. Thus, the biceps   muscle is weakest at the start of the exercise and strongest at the   halfway point of the exercise. When doing a biceps curl with a free   weight, the individual is limited to how much resistance he can use by   how strong the biceps are at the beginning of the exercise (its   weakest point). That means that during the biceps curl, the muscle is   not receiving adequate resistance when the muscle is in its strongest   point in the range of motion. When performing a curl with elastic   tubing, however, the resistance increases as the range of motion   increases. This means the muscle is receiving greater resistance at   its strongest point in the range of motion and therefore is receiving   more adequate resistance to better stimulate strength adaptations.  "
429,Does anything treat and/or prevent inflammation,"I train in long distance running and sometimes end up with typical running injuries often attributed to inflammation.  For example, I recently had to take long-ish breaks because of what I believe to be shin splints and Achilles tendon inflammation.  Besides breaks from running and strengthening exercices, are there other things that treat inflammation or help prevent it?   For example, ice and NSAIDs are often suggested.  Do they treat inflammation or only reduce the pain it causes?  I just want to put everything on my side. "
430,How are related the weights a healthy athlete can lift in different exercises?,"I see that in SL5x5, the weight increments are bigger for Squats and Deadlifts. I am curious about that. It seems obvious too that you are not expected to lift the same weight in an isolating, small muscle exercise like Reverse DB Flies, than the amount you lift in a big compound Bench Press.  What are good proportions between weights in different exercises, for a well balanced athlete?  Is there any canonical, numerical proportion between loads for different exercises?  (I guess we could have a rough idea by looking at the training statistics of some known athletes. Any idea about where to get such data?) "

I would really want to get into some calisthenics stuff (L-pull ups, typewriter pullups, muscle ups, etc). The ultimate goal being able to do at least one muscle up. Does anyone have any suggestions for a 5/3/1 template that includes calisthenics say? Assuming my knee heals and I can train all 4 movements properly, my idea is this. ""Bbb"" stands for boring but big.   Bench 5/3/1, overhead press bbb, dumbell bench, calisthenics. Squat 5/3/1, squat bbb, calisthenics Overhead press 5/3/1, bench bbb, calisthenics Deadlift 5/3/1, kroc rows, calisthenics   How do I implement this calisthenics stuff in such a way that I can track my progress? The great thing about 5/3/1 is that I can track progress, and I would like to be able to do the same with the calisthenics stuff.  Edit: I don't do 5x10 on the deadlift because many people have advised me not to. In theory I should be substituting this with a more back friendly variation, such as RDLs or GHRs. "

I was running today on the treadmill, and decided to increase the speed a little bit, but after some time my left calf suddenly ""froze"" (thats the best description I can give), accompanied by a sudden but brief stab of pain, so I immediately stopped. I went on to stretch my legs a little bit, and was able to walk (although with some slight discomfort). The area near the muscle is not swollen, but it is slightly tender and I can feel some slight twinging if I rotate my foot. Can someone please tell me if this is  a muscle tear or just a cramp? It may be pertinent to mention that I did strength training yesterday focusing on my legs and calves.Also, I do drink a lot of water (>2L a day). Should I wait before I can do anymore lower body exercise or can I continue if I feel OK? "
435,Knee ligament stretches,"I have this problem. Since I'm a dancer, but I'm also a tad bit overweight, the strain on my knee joints and ligaments is a little bit bigger than it should be. So, a while ago I started feeling pain in Patellar ligament, or to be more specific, in the place where it connects to the bone. The doc told me to abstain from dancing for a while, while I reduce my weight, but this is not possible, since a competition is coming up. Some elastic binding do help with the pain. But I also think, that a possible cause for this pain is not stretching the ligament enough before a practice, so my question is this:  How do I warm up my Patellar ligament? What are some stretching exercises for this, without a lot of equipment? I have a ballet bar, a floor, and some people, that can help me stretch, and that is about it.  Also, it's not like I haven't tried to find something for this, I just can't think of anything. "
436,Weightlifting with only one set of weights,"I've been looking to gain muscle/lift a little in order to be less weak.   Unfortunately, I only own one pair of 10lb dumbbells which I use for dumbbell pressing. As a weak 6'0(182cm) 132 lb.(60kg) 17yr old, I don't have access to public gyms, or buying more weights.  My question is this:   Will increasing the number of reps I can do back to back help with muscle gain, or will this gain plateau eventually?  If so, are heavier weights absolutely necessary for muscle gain? "
437,Why doesn't stretching feel good?,"I hear people say they like to stretch out because it feels good. I've never had that experience. It's not painful, but it's somewhere between unpleasant and neutral. Hence, stretching is work, and I have to struggle to motivate myself to do it.  What are the factors that affect how stretching feels? How can we make it feel good to stretch? "
438,Why does CrossFit use Kipping Pull-ups?,"For regular workouts there is information on the benefits and importance of doing pull-ups regularly.  CrossFit even mentions it in this article. Men's Health even talks about this in one of their blogs/articles.    CrossFit Pull-ups looks like they use kipping (where you using a forceful initial leg movement for momentum which looks like swinging).  As a physical therapist and a strength coach, I do not encourage the violent movement from the Kipping Pull-ups exercise.  I've treated many patients over the years with Upper Trap Strain and Shoulder Injury as a result from doing the Kipping Pull-ups from CrossFit.  Why do Kipping Pull-ups in the first place?  Also, if you are a CrossFit lover or a Certified CrossFit Trainer, how should I approach you without you thinking that I'm against CrossFit philosophy? "
439,"1 hour of weights, followed by 1 hour of swimming, followed by 1 hour of jogging: analysis?","ive put on 40kg over the past 18 months due to eating large portions and a total lack of exercise.   I used to be incredibly fit, and would regularly (weekly) follow the exercise regime outlined in the question title: first i would go to the gym for an hour and lift heavy weights. Then i would briefly jog down the road to the pool and swim for 40 minutes to an hour (breast stroke. Around 30 laps of 50m). After this i would alternate between jogging, sprinting and walking around the city (Sydney) for another hour or so. Sometimes i would travel quite a distance (pyrmont to botanic gardens, following the waterfront, for those who know Sydney).  I can say that the happy brain chemicals were firing hard when i used to do this, maximum dopamine, serotonin and endorphins. I also slept like a baby and had amazing dreams. Life was good. (TMI warning: i also regularly got rock hard erections upon waking and throughout the day immediately following this workout, which was pleasant in an ""I've got a healthy sex drive"" kinda way)  My situation now is that I'm totally out of practice. I haven't been regularly exercising for about 30 months, and I've been steadily piling on weight for 18 months. Im currently at 105kg and slowly but steadily climbing. I'm at a point where it is impossible to sprint, difficult and painful to run, and i can only jog for incredibly short distances. I haven't swum laps for around 18 months and my body shape has significantly changed, so I'm not sure how hydrodynamic i will be in the water, whether i will have trouble breathing, whether my endurance will be so bad that I can't even finish a lap at medium speed without getting exhausted, etc. As regards the gym, i have been a couple of times in the past few months and i struggle to lift the weight i used to. At my peak i think i was bench pressing 24kg, now i can just manage 14kg.  My question is basically, what advice can you give me, and how would you analyse my old workout in light of my current situation (incredibly unfit, 105kg). I have a lot of time on my hands right now and would like to focus on fitness, ideally returning to my old 3 hour workout, but I'm worried that it might be too intense and result in injury given my current level of fitness. What tweaks should i make to the routine? Should i cut out the jogging and running? Swim and gym for only 40 minutes each? I would like to push myself to a point beyond the point of exhaustion, but without causing injury. Perhaps swimming and lifting weights for two hours would be enough?   Cheers "
440,How do I construct a cutting plan?,"As the title suggests, I was wondering how one should go about constructing a proper cutting diet and workout plan? I will be finishing with a bulking routine at the end of August, and I would like to start soon thereafter--dropping 1 lb of fat per week and saving as much muscle mass as possible. How does one go about doing this?   My stats:   Sex: Male Age: 29 Height: 6 feet Weight: 185 lbs (by the end of August) bf %: 18 percent (flucuates)  I'd like to drop to around 12 percent body fat if possible.   Thanks! "
441,Feeling uneasy at 90-100 BPM and it takes time to lower it down,"I've a sedentary life style, however, I'm trying to be more active recently.  Whenever I do any activity with moderate intensity e.g. trimming plants, going up/down stairs, running even for a 200m or do any activity which involve my upper body my heart rate (bpm) goes upto 120-130, that might be normal. It then takes a few minutes to go down to 90bpm (while resting), but then it stays there relatively for a longer time (i.e. 1hr+) and during this time I consistently feel uneasy (symptom: dry throat, harder to fully breath, light-headness, muscle tension in upper chest where it meets the throat).  A few times I also tried to finish ""7 Minute Workout"" but my heart rate got high, I felt very uneasy and stopped it.  My question is, should not the BPM get down to 65-75bpm (my resting heart rate) from 90bpm relatively faster? and further, is it normal to feel uneasy (especially the provided symptoms) at 90-100bpm (while resting)? If not then what could be the issue? "
442,Correct form and technique in single leg db deadlifts in detail,"What is the correct form and technique for the single leg db deadlift in detail? I also want to know why one should do it in this way and not differently. What are common mistakes when doing this, why are they harmful and how to fix them.  If there are reasonable technique variations please also mention it and explain the how and why.  Over the web there you can see pictures of multiple different forms which makes you unsure whats correct and whats not. Take for example this picture:     You can see that the standing leg is slightly bend and that the arms are not perpendicular to the ground (as it would be the case in a normal deadlift). However perhaps this makes sense for the single leg deadlift, I don't know.  In the next picture the arms are perpendicular to the ground:    In the next picture only one dumbbell is used and the standing leg is straight:     However I also found images where the dumbbell is in the hand on the side of the standing leg:    I also found this variation which seems to be similar to the regular deadlift:    Is there a rough rule of thumb which gives a relation between the weight you can use in a regular deadlift and that one you can use in a db single leg deadlift? "
443,One set weight lifting?,Timothy Ferriss has a lot of fitness and nutrition advice in the bestseller 4-hour body.  He advocates one-set-only (per muscle group) workouts.  Is that good advice? 
444,Doing it right: sit-ups,"How do you train sit-ups correctly?  I've heard you can damage your back if you don't do it right.  Also, are there any varieties that allows one to use weights or similar objects? I ask about this because I want to build bigger muscles rather than focusing on endurance.  I get it you need to do few repetitions. "
445,Arnie's pull-up strategy,"Here's something Arnold Schwarzenegger wrote about how to increase the number of pull-ups you can do in one set:     Let’s say that before you start training back one day you tell yourself you’re going to do 50 total reps of chins. For the first set you may do 10, then perhaps you struggle for eight on the second set. You have 18 reps now. If you make five for the third set, you have 23 reps. Continue to add them in this way until you’ve reached 50 reps, even if it takes you 20 sets to do it. Over time, you’ll find that you’re able to reach 50 reps in fewer and fewer sets   Is this a safe strategy? If it is, is it an effective workout plan?  I don't just mean in regards to pull-ups but calisthenics in general. "
446,Stretches for Lifts,"Is there a good reference that I could use to pair stretches with weight lifts? I'm never sure which stretches to use to counter any flexibility losses for a particular lift.  To give a concrete example, what stretches are a good pairing for:   hammer dumbell curls incline bench press   Is there a good book for this? Website? App? "
447,Should everyone be able to touch their elbows to their torso?,"I'm male, with a large build. I have a barrel chest and a somewhat triangular upper body.  I also lift weights. I'm not totally sure that I could tuck my elbows into the side of my torso before I started lifting weights, but I definitely can't now. My arm close to my shoulder touches my torso, but the closer you get to my elbow, the more space there is between my arm and my torso. At the elbow, the gap is several inches, fist-sized.  Is that totally normal due to the geometry of my body and the the space consumed by my chest and arm muscles? Should I just ignore it completely? Or is it a loss of flexibility due to weight lifting that I should attempt to correct through stretching?  The gap seems much larger when my elbow is bent, possibly because of the extra space taken by my contracted muscles? When my arm is relaxed, there is much less space between my elbow and torso. "
448,What is the reasoning behind Creatine not being recommended for under 18s?,"Possibly better suited to Biology but assuming people here will be more knowledgable on this specific area of Human Biology  It's general practice for Creatine it seems to have 'No Under 18s', however what is the reasoning behind this. Apart from the obvious, that nobody wants to try it on kids for fear of repercussions along their whole lives, is there any scientific basis to believe that under 18s would have any adverse affects to it that cause bad reactions/decline in growth, etc., as from what I can see it terms of hormones it only debatably effects testosterone (increase) and oestrogen (decrease), and in a male surely that would only have positive effects on growth due to the only minor adjustments, not pushing rates outside of the norm?  In brief, is there any reasoning apart from just fear of 'we're not exactly sure and wouldn't want to risk damaging kids' that Creatine is not recommended generally for under 18s? "
449,What difference does training with kettlebells make to the appearance?,"I read that kettlebells training does not isolate the muscles, contrary to dumbbell or dead-lifts. What does this mean to the effects in the body? If you look at someone and try to guess how he was training, would you be able to see it? "
450,How to lose fat fast and healthily?,"I want to lose some belly fat, get six-pack abs and look good naked. I want my muscles to show. Im of an average build, a bit too chubby to my liking.  What can I do to achieve my goal? What pitfalls and mistakes should I avoid? How much time must I spend daily on exercise? "
451,"When taking vitamins and supplements, does it matter if I take them all at once or should I spread it out throughout the day?","Currently I am taking a multivitamin, fish oil, and I recently added vitamin D supplements (D3 to be specific).  My current routine is take each of the three (along with some unrelated medication in pill form) after I eat breakfast each day.   The addition of the Vitamin D supplement has led me to wonder if taking all of these at the same time of the day is the best idea, or if it would be better to take them separately. For example, my multivitamin already has 400 IU of Vitamin D in it, and then I am adding another 1000 IU in the D3 pill.   Is my body capable of ingesting this much of the vitamin (along with everything else in the multivitamin) at the same time, or will some of it be wasted and end up being excreted? Would it be better to take one at morning and one at night? "
452,Will wearing thick clothes during cardio provide better weight loss results?,Is it true that i should wear thick clothes such as a hoody while doing cardio to sweat more? Or is it just water weight that gets put back on when you drink? I have heard both. 
453,Are there benefits of having Ashwagandha / Withania somnifera as pre-workout supplement?,Ashwagandha is referred as one of the best T-Booster supplement as mentioned here.  Also Cellucor P6 T-Booster has Ashwagandha in it.  My question is can i take Ashwagandha root/pills before workout? Will it improve the performance? 
454,Does working a diverse set of muscles increase metabolism?,"By supplementing my running with working additional muscle groups, can I increase my metabolism? I'm thinking of doing about 30 situps 30 pushups before running and gradually building up. I might add some additional weight/core training in the mix.  Lets say for arguments sake I burn 25 calories doing these exercises. Will the 25 calories applied to different muscle groups increase my metabolism any moreso then if I had just burned 25 calories by doing more running? Is working different muscles any better then just using the same muscles over-and-over? "
455,What is the difference between a turtle freezes and a peacock pose?,"A turtle freeze is, as I understand it, a breakdancing move where you hold yourself parallel to the ground with your body weight going into your elbows. Pic:    Isn't this essentially a peacock yoga pose?:    The breakdancer, in the pic, is a bit more jagged but it seems like they're still essentially the same thing? "
456,"Dislocated left shoulder, which core exercises are safe?","TL;DR I dislocated my left shoulder a month ago and it is slowly healing. Which exercises are safe to build my abs, chest and back?  I have dislocated my left shoulder a month ago. It is no longer throbbing with pain or causing numbness in my left arm. I can sideways open it up for 90 degrees and continue my daily routine with ease. However, it is not completely healed yet.  Meanwhile, I have a large belly I am trying to get rid of. In the last two months I lost 5.5 kg (from 70.8 kg to 65.3 kg). Since I am 171/m, I do not wish to lose any more weight but get rid of the belly fat.  Due to my condition, the exercise I currently do are   Wall sits Leg raises (one at a time, double leg raises causes slight pain in my shoulder) Crunches (with my hands on my chest, not around ears)   I do the last two exercises on a relatively soft bed, however, I plan to move to an exercise mat.  As I said my primary ambition is to get rid of belly fat and secondary one is to build up my biceps, shoulders, abs, chest and back. 2 kg biceps curls with a water bottle do not really hurt, but I only do one or two to check if it hurts. Besides, I used to do 7 kg curls the last time I exercised, so 2-3 kg curls would probably mean nothing.  Biceps and shoulders before completely healing my shoulder might be hopeless, but what can I do to develop my abs, chest and back? "
457,How to choose a routine for building muscles?,"When searching for the internet, or even talking to trainers, you will get an infinite number of routines. How should one choose a routine that is best for him? Is there any logic about it at all?  I'm not addressing the exercises themselves but to the general diversion of muscle groups across days of the week. It looks like every mix is possible even when I'm looking for the most recommended routines. Of course most of the routines don't include any explanation other than ""you will see the results in X months"".   The only logical thing about routines that I've heard is that it's better to do the Biceps exercises the same day you do the back, and Triceps on the shoulders + chest day, because the big muscle exercises also effort the according arm-muscle. This way you provide full rest for the Biceps/Triceps when it's not their workout day.   Is this true, can I have more examples for this kind of sense in the vague world of routines?  I'm working out since August and my results are not satisfying enough. I'm not looking for reasons of why I didn't grow up the way I wanted, but for a fresh routine to become more motivated and consistent. It's just so hard to pick one, and it seems so... consequences-full.  I'm having 4 workout days a week. "
458,Home chest push ups-middle-inner-low,"I will be focusing on push-ups because I have no money for a gym. I have checked out many videos, reading a lot, but I would like your help to achieve the best results I can for doing push-ups at home with no equipment.   Upper chest - Which kind of push-ups do you think would offer me the best results? Middle chest - I haven't found a workout for these. Lower pecs - Which kind of push-up? I have seen a video that says that the hands should be not far from the chest when someone moves down up. Also, it looks like you should have something like chair or small table in front of you. How much should I be doing? (time/days)  "
459,What is the difference between a crane pose and a frog tuck?,"Crane poses are yoga moves:    A frog tuck, as I understand it, is mainly a gymnastics move that's taught as a progression to, among other things, planches:    Are they pretty much the same thing, just with different names?  I note that in the crane pose pic the persons knees are above the elbow whereas in the frog tuck pic they're below. From what I've read (writings by Christopher Sommer) a frog tuck is supposed to have the knees above the elbow so I figure the pic just isn't that great a pic.  Any ideas? "
460,Why working the Rotator Cuff in the high reps & low weight range? Isn't that wrong?,"I can understand that the muscles of the Rotator Cuff group are small and therefore I could understand the recommendation of using much lighter dumbbells in relation to other exercises. But almost in any site I have found, the recommendation is to always work them with the lightest pink dumbbells and in the >15 rep range.  Isn't that wrong? Why not to strengthen that small muscles by working them with sets of 5 reps too with increasing weight?. For instance, a rule of thumb such as ""use one tenth of the weight you use for the overhead press"" or something similar would be very interesting.  "
461,Alternative push-up methods for sightly fat people ,"Let's say I'm a little too fat to be doing a real push up.   Do you recommend me to push up with my knees supporting my body first and then progress further?  OR Do you think it's better if I start with the less push ups, (say.. 5.. 10..15.. incremental over days)?   My goals are to increase endurance, strengthen my wrists, forearms, and chest.  Disclaimer: I'm not really fat. No offence to any if they sorta are. "
462,What's wrong with workout routines for muscle building?,"I am using a workout routine to gain more muscles in the upper body. For many months (5 so far) I've been following a plan which caused a 2cm (almost 1 inch) girth increase in my biceps and forearms but I think I could get more. I am following a healthy diet (lots of protein, vegetables, healthy fats e.t.c.). The plan I'm following says to work out twice a week (Mondays, Thursdays) for about 45 minutes (first 5 minutes is a warm-up). It's a full body workout. 4 sets with 12 reps per each muscle group. And I gained these 2cm but in the mirror I see nothing. My current age is 36.  On the other hand my lower body, especially my legs are extremely well built, full of muscles and almost no fat. And I gained these muscles when I was young (around 15). I didn't follow any diet and no workout plan at all. I was riding a bicycle, about 30-50km a day just for fun, sometimes faster, sometimes at slower pace. I was eating whatever I found in the fridge (and not directly after the ride as I never feel hungry directly after a physical activity). And sometimes I was eating only 2-3 times a day, big meals (not 6-7 small meals like it's recommended nowadays). And I didn't have 2-3 days for muscle regeneration as my workout plan recommends. What's more - my plan says (and many articles on the web) that cardio is bad for muscle gain but... this is actually what I was doing on my bicycle, right? My legs are full of big muscles until today although I don't train them too much now. I built them doing cardio for 1-2 hours everyday on my bike. Maybe the key was in my diet? (I was eating a lot of potatoes and bread during that time).  What's more: my friend is a physical worker and he doesn't go to the gym but he just uses his muscles at work for 8h a day. 5 days a week. No breaks for regeneration, no special diet and his upper body is really well built.  And I can show many more counterexamples like these that contradict the modern workout plans that recommend to avoid cardio, sleep a lot, work out every 2-3 days for 1h max. So is there something wrong about the current recommendations for body building? "

I use the hill extensively during my runs, but I am afraid it may not be sufficient to prepare for 2-8km climbs.  Today I extended my workouts with running stairs (42 floors, about 130 meters). Is it a good idea? What other exercise could I add to my workouts? "
466,How can I learn running barefoot on asphalt without having blisters?,I have been running for years for fun. Since last year I am interested in marathons. I attended 2 marathons and currently getting prepared for Munich marathon.  I run 4 times a week.  And I would like to run barefoot at one or two of my easy runs per week.  I have tried first time this morning; I did 5k and ended up with minor blisters.  How can I run on asphalt barefoot without having blisters?  Does the skin get used to it after a couple of -easy- runs? Or should I use a heel first style bcoz of the asphalt? 
467,"Which is which in XxY specifications (i.e. 5x5, 3x5, etc.)?","When specifying sets and reps like 5x5, 3x5, (in general, XxY), which is which?  It seems like it usually means ""X sets of Y reps."" but on some forums I see logs that seem to indicate that either they are (a) doing dozens of 1 rep sets (which might be valid) or (b) they are using the notation in the other order (i.e. ""X reps done Y times"").  Is there a ""traditional"" way of reading/writing these?  "
468,Can I finish a marathon without finishing training?,"I'm new to running (casually started last year, running on &amp; off). I've since run a few 5ks &amp; 10ks. My weekly mileage is ~20 miles/week with longest run of 15 miles.  If it makes any difference, I've done all of my training w/out taking anything with me (gu, water, gatorade). I just completed a half-marathon in two hours flat with negative splits and didn't feel much leg pain until the last couple of miles.   My first full marathon is in three weeks. I completely mismarked it on my calendar (weeks earlier than I had initially thought) and also missed a couple weeks of critical training (prior to the half marathon).   I realize I won't be able to run the entire thing but really hope to at least finish by adopting some sort of strategy like alternating running/walking and not be miserable.   Can I expect to finish the marathon?  What should be my walk:run ratio and/or pace to safely finish based on the half?  What sort of training if any can  I do the three weeks prior?  EDIT: I've read this post. I'm asking more about how or if I can finish rather than whether or not I should try.  UPDATE: I finished the marathon (on five hours sleep with a long run of 18 miles). I ran most of it. The first 15 were a breeze. Had some ups &amp; downs for the following 6 miles. The last 5 miles were a bit rough but at that point there was no turning back (and I was so happy with the running community's encouragement when we crossed paths!). Felt good to cross the finish line in a reasonable amount of time. It was definitely mind over matter at that point though, I look forward to running another one with proper training and beating my time! "
469,What does road biking do to improve your running?,"Marathon training has greatly helped build my cardio in running such that my rare bicycle ride has been the longer than ever - and faster. This and the pushing part of the pedal stroke seem to be alot stronger from running.  Talking to an avid biker I found out this is a known that you can run into biking shape but not the other way around.  Since the bike is focusing on different muscles than running then do these muscles turn into strengths for running?  I think maybe it can help your sprinting, cadence, and speed. Could this be?  What benefit for improving your running, if any, comes from biking?  Thanks :) "
470,Pilates- Taking time to learn form versus... actually doing it?,"I bought this manual on the Pilates method and upon reading it, I was pretty surprised how wrong my form has been all along. This manual has enough detail for each exercise to effectively keep breathing, core, control, flow, etc all coordinated but not overwhelm the reader.  However, I'm kind of compulsive with doing it right, and the past seven sessions I would read the 1-3 pages for each exercise before actually doing the exercise. I feel this helps me enforce the proper form without an instructor, but it is taking a hit on the ""flow"" of each exercise.   So my question is how concerned should I be with reading the manual before executing each exercise? Should every other day I toss the manual aside and do the exercises (and the mental form checklists) from memory? My goal is to have the Pilates method completely memorized and to have form perfect. "
471,Dealing with a bulging disc in lower back,"A few months ago I thought I herniated a disc in my lower back, but it turns out the disc is just slightly bulging. Yay!  I went to a neurosurgeon who took at look at my MRI results and basically told me I can't do anything to make the situation better. No physical therapy, no drugs (except for pain relievers), no surgery, nothing can help. I can only wait it out and hope for the best, and there's still a chance that nothing will improve. He did tell me that the injury wasn't that bad at all, and to a degree he is right—I can walk, jog, play some casual sports. But nothing serious.  So three things:  1) Any ideas on improving the injury? I know the surgeon said I can't do anything and I know you guys aren't all doctors, but I appreciate any ideas I can look into.   2) How do I deal with this mentally? I was just told I can't do anything at all about this, nothing.   3) Any ideas for sports I can try to pick up? I have cycled before and thought about going back to it, maybe that.  "
472,"Is it literally possible to strengthen the fingers directly through finger exercises, or are they in conjunction with the hands mainly?","I have seen many finger exercises, but some have noted that fingers are conjoined with hands in muscularity and use, so can you really strengthen or isolate the fingers indirectly from the hand muscles, or must they work in conjunction always?  I know there are different types of grip, like pinch, crush, static endurance application, etc.  But regarding the fingers specifically, because I notice some people just have really tough fingers aside from strong hands, and although my hands aren't ""weak"" my fingers aren't actually strong, and are pretty frail.  So my question is, are the fingers conjoined 100% with the hands, or can they be worked on more directly through exercises without worrying about over working hand muscles interchangeably?  Thanks in advance.  "
473,looking for best way to progressively increase my leg muscles without making my hurt cartilage more hurt?,"I have chondromalacia patella under which the cartilage has become a lot thinner than a normal person's.   I have no idea why that happens to a young man like me.   I have not had any external injuries. However, I still hope to exercise my legs.   Squat leg workout, I think, does not fit me at the moment, so I have tried seated leg press.   Is that the right way to start ?  Because my knee caps really are not feeling good and I can hear ""click, click"" all the way during the workout.  That is a little intimidating to me.  I wanna ask, in my current situation, what might be the best way to progressively increase my leg muscles without hurting my poor cartilage? "
474,How much water is too much?,"I know, that there is the standard 8x8oz glasses or ~ 3 liters of water per day. But today I read, that since about 75% of muscle is water, people using their muscles intensively need more water, about two times as much as standard.  So my question is: at which point does more become too much?   How much water can I drink before I start hurting my kidneys?  Background: I'm currently drinking about 5 liters of water per day if training, about 4 if on rest. "

476,How is WAVA age grading calculated?,"WAVA (now WMA) age grading is a method of comparing your running (and maybe other athletic?) performance across ages and genders. Most places describe it as being relative to the world record performance for a certain distance in your age/gender category (although not all).  However, I would like to know what it means to be further down the WAVA grading. Where is 0%? Is it the slowest performance ever recorded?  Is the range based on some sort of normal distribution? Is 50% WAVA some sort of average time for that age/gender category? "
477,Good clean bulking meals,"I've been clean bulking for a long while but after eating the same things for a long while it gets hard to keep eating it every day. Do you guys have any advice on meals with many complex carbs, protein, and calories?  My list is primarily as follows:  - Brown rice - Whole wheat pasta - Eggs - Oats - Peanutbutter - Potatoes - Can of tuna (preferably in olive oil) - Chicken fillet (mostly in rice or nasi)  My caloriebomb shake recipe (credits to buffdudes) - Massgainer - 150gr fine oats - Banana - 2 spoons of peanutbutter - water (or milk but I think water tastes just fine)  Blend it and you will have a 1000-1500 calorie shake with  complex carbs + good fats + proteins + all that you would want from a massgainer   Do you guys have anything else to add to the list for the sake of variation? Eating the same things all day really gets boring after a while and tempting to cheat. "
478,Are slender gels any good?,Does it make any sense to use caffeine/menthol slendering gels? There are many products for women and also some from (I've seen abdomen gel from shiseido). Do such gels work? Do you recommend any?  EDIT What I mean by those gels working is: do they really increase fat loss in the areas where you use them? 
479,can only lift lower body and core,"For the next 6 months or so I can't lift upper body as I'm recovering from labrum repair surgery. I can't squat (bar goes on back, I would assume is not good) or deadlift (pulls on shoulder), but I should be able to leg sled (don't worry, I'll ask my doctor to clarify on Monday). Usually I lift Monday and Thursday upper body and tuesday and Friday lower, and do Abs all those days. That means simply eradicating upper would result in only two days, and I want to lift 3 or 4 days a week (preferably 4: I need to get huge). But how do I space a solely lower body workout into 3/4 days? What lifts should I do for some diversity? It seems like I'd run out of lifts or have pathetically short sessions. Should I just do the same workout every day a few times a week? And should I do 4 days of lower body, or would that not give me enough time to rest?  EDIT: I'm going to get physical therapy from a professional, and yes I'll ask my surgeon and the pt what lower body lifts I can and can't do, but for now I'm pretty sure I can't squat or clean or deadlift. I'm asking what are some more, less common lifts I can do to keep my workouts long enough and how should I divide them up and into how many days. (Nothing overhead and nothing that rests on shoulder and nothing that requires me to hold with arm, but perhaps only with one arm would be acceptable. Again, I'll talk with doc what I can and can't do )  EDIT: the labrum in context is the one in my right shoulder "
480,Why am I gaining weight?,"Over the past couple of months, I have done several tiny improvements to intake lesser calories and burn more calories. For example:   breakfast with cereals instead of two multigrain bread slices with Nutella less rice meals in a week less buns in lunch no chocolate in snacks only one can of soda per month walking 15 minutes daily and light exercise (burning 100-200 calories) each day   Yet I have noticed that I am constantly putting on weight, around 1 lb each month at the minimum. I know that I am not burning 1000 calories per day, but shouldn't I see loosing some weight over a period of 4-5 months?  When I strictly followed my food intake for a given day, it does not exceed 15001 calories (maximum).  What am I doing wrong?    After reading the Moses reply, I am adding the image showing my TTDE.      1: Estimated by calories' count on food labels. "
481,"Strength Training, Muscle Mass, and Weight Loss","I heard on a podcast that pounds of fat burn calories at a different rate than pounds of muscle.  The thinking is that a pound of fat, sitting idly over the course of the day, requires X calories, whereas a pound of muscle, sitting idly over the course of the day (that is to say, without being vigorously exercised) requires X+Y calories, because muscle is ""more expensive"" for your body to maintain, nutritionally speaking.  That would seem to imply that if one were to undertake a workout regimen designed to build muscles (lots of strength training, minimal focus on cardiovascular activities) that the additional muscle mass would result in the body burning more calories per day while it was in its ""at rest"" state.  That would seem to imply that one would then be able to lose some of their fat weight, as they would now have a more favorable ratio of caloric intake to caloric expenditure.  Is this a healthful approach to weight loss?  If someone were in a situation where they were overweight (but not yet obese) is strength-training a logical approach to achieving a higher fitness level? "
482,Injury cause in elbow position,"I have experienced two injuries:  one doing bent over dumb bell row like this  I got injured when my elbow left contact with my torso and flared up outside and got sharp pain in my shoulder.  Other one while doing chest bench press, same scenario when my elbows flaired up.  Why my shoulder is getting injured by my flaring of elbows? I do know that flaring is wrong movement, but is there any exercise which will strengthen my shoulder muscle which is getting affected by my flaring up elbow?  "
483,Best routine to lose weight?,"I am wanting to lose half a stone maybe a stone before the years out. I have just started. I am doing a intense 15 minute work out (push ups, planks, star jumps, forward lounges etc) then 3 different sets of sit ups doing 30 of each then a mile jog at night. Does this seem sufficient? Any other non gym and non equipment ways of losing the weight? "

485,Bench press starting position - what should I be looking at?,"In the link below, Mark Rippetoe of Starting Strength says that when positioning oneself for a bench press:  [website]  Your eyes should not be gazing   directly beneath the bar, but rather   looking just past the ""foot side"" of   the bar.   Any idea what the ""foot side"" of the bar is?  When lying on my back, should the bar be right above my eyes? "

487,How can one improve performance on the back scratch test (zipper test)?,"The Apley Scratch Test (aka zipper test, or Back Scratch Test) involves trying to touch your middle fingers behind your back, with one arm reaching back over the shoulder and the other reaching up from behind. How can I increase shoulder mobility (most likely scapular mobility) to be able to do this? What specific shoulder function is it testing?  I can do it with my right arm, but not my left. Is it possibly a natural shoulder-blade alignment difference from being right-handed?  Edit: Here is a video of me attempting the test. Even through my back hair, you can see my left shoulder blade moves differently right from the start. I believe this is a muscle issue because a muscle activation therapist massaged various muscles and I was able to touch my fingers on the left just as well as on the right... but only during that one session. I have not been able to achieve it with self-massage. Which muscle could be responsible for the difference? "
488,Neck discomfort after Overhead Press - is it serious?,"I was doing overhead press and felt some pressure in my neck (I think I was straining my neck while I did them - weight was too heavy?). My neck was pretty sore after and I had trouble rotating it, but that went away after a day or two.  I did overhead press a week later; felt alright during the exercise, but afterwards, I had the same problem with my neck.  Two days later, I did back squats, and I think I aggravated the problem probably because sometimes my bar position wasn't ideal and it rested on a vertebrae for a little (shit).   There is no pain now, but a decent amount of discomfort that extends to my right upper back, and my neck's range of motion is a bit screwy.  Is there a certain amount of time I should wait before convincing myself that this is a serious problem and not something that will go away in a couple of days?  Side question: Has anyone had this experience after overhead press - any tips? However, I think there's a greater chance that this is because of the back squat.  Edit: It actually feels a little better when I press on my right upper back with my right hand. Not sure what that means. Lifting my right arm seems to alleviate pain - left arm not as much. "
489,Getting PAIN when you do something you havent done in a while,"It is very common to get soreness/pain/DOMS when you do something you haven't done in a while (like skiing or bench) - Even when working far from max.  Is this because something with the muscles, or is it more related to what we are doing?  Is the training less effective at this point or will you  gain more compared to how hard you work (because untrained muscles are easier to train)?(In relation to max).  Does this ""regularness"" effect continue into regular training? (If we compare doing something regularly/often compared to less regularly/often)  If you for example compare a program with many sets (Starting Strength), to one with few sets (4 hour body)?  Does this irregulars effect have a name?  Is there some methodology for how to minimize it?  Practically for things I do like weights, hikings, Pilates, Yoga with some strength I want to minimize this effect (Be beeing ""just regular enough"") "
490,Unable to accustome to running in higher temperatures as a runner,"I've just completed my first marathon last sunday. It was pretty much a global disaster. I started cramping up at the 18km (11mile) mark before completely comming to a halt at km 31 (19.5 miles). I finished in around 5hours. Way beyond the 4h mark which was (based on my training) calculated as expected finishing time (=my long run training tempo). In the end I wasn't tired(=which frustrated me), I just had cramps all over the place.  As I trained thoroughly for 6 months completing no less then 7  times a 20milers without feeling any exhaustion/cramps.  One of the reasons of my failure was the warm day I believe (next to me being nervous). It was 26°C (78,8 F) at its warmest. And I tend to fail/cramp up during warmer weather. I've tried pretty much every trick in the book:   Drinking extra during the run Drinking sports-drinks or any electrolyte rich drink which I used in training Taking electrolyte/salt-rich tablets during the run Antacid tablets ...   The marathon itself was at a near-coastal town (Bruges) and 100% on paved roads. I live some 40km from the town and experience the same climate/temperatures.  So I was wondering if there are any training techniques/tips which might help my body perform better during warmer days? Does any had the same problem &amp; how did they overcome it?  Sidenotes: before any mentions under-training   Pre marathon Training load: around 65k/week (=40miles) Number of 20milers: 7 in the 2,5 months leading up to the marathon. all without cramps or fatigue.

491,Facial muscles and tightening the skin,"   Muscles like your biceps or your quadriceps, the muscles we are used   to working out are called skeletal muscles and their contractions and   extensions help control our bones. The muscles on our face however,   are attached from the bone underneath directly to the skin. This is   why and how we can make facial expressions. This is a good thing for   our plight because it means that with developing those muscles also   comes the potential for tightening the skin around them   Source: [website]Is that statement correct ?   Does that mean that by doing facial exercise I can tighten the skin around the jaw, given that I don't have fat there and the skin is elastic ? "
492,Proposed Olympic/Power Routine To Meet Unusual Requirements,"edited in response to comments  Below is a detailed mixed olympic and power lifting routine.  In particular, I have annotated what seems to be the most unusual features.  I currently use the routine.  I am wondering: is optimal considering it's purpose and my constraints?  A list of specific concerns can be found at the very bottom of the post.  Some background:  I lifted seriously using a low rep routine for a number of years before getting injured and taking time off for work.  I am now, after many years, getting back to the gym.  Have discovered and fallen in love with ""olympic"" style lifting.  The purpose of the routine is to accommodate my ridiculous work schedule (sometimes 6 12 hour days per week of sometimes mathematically creative work).  I am not at all interested in bodybuilding (muscle proportions/symmetry), but I am very interested in increasing general athleticism (power/flexibility) and somewhat interested in losing weight.  6 workouts per week; 15 min warm up 15 min high effort.  I find it much easier to get to the gym regularly if it is as rigid an element of my schedule as work; I also find that if I expend too much energy on any given workout then I cannot work a full day; also, after completing a full day, I very rarely have the mental energy left to safely lift heavy.  4 power days per week; 2 olympic days per week.  Bench; snatch; squat; incline; clean/jerk (I squat or push jerk, not split);  deadlift[; rest].  I do not do any assistance work for reasons already described; I chose these exercises for the following reasons:   snatch:  it's my favorite lift and it is the most athletic movement that you can do at the gym clean and jerk:  it's the most explosive movement you can do at the gym; it's always fun picking heavy things up over your head squat:  muscular/mechanical -- and also electrical/mental and endocrine/chemical -- effects of doing big movements with heavy weight are compelling deadlift:  same as for the squat bench:  it is the heaviest and one of the longer upper body movements incline bench same as for bench   I used to only bench, snatch, and squat.  I found that (with 2 squats per week) to be too repetitive; in particular, too hard on the knees.  On any given day I warm up as necessary.  Then do either two or three weighted sets (depending on how I am feeling) for some number of reps, according to the following progression:   Week 0.  Start with a 45 pound bar ""W0"".  Do as many reps ""R0"" as possible. Week 1.  3 sets of R0/3 reps with W0 weight. Weeks 2 - ??.  While possible, do the same number of sets and reps, but increase W0 by 10 or 20 (depending on the exercise and how I am feeling:  20 for squats, deadlifts, clean/jerks, snatches; 10 for bench/incline, clean/jerk, snatches). Weeks ?? - ????.  When the above loop fails, decrease R0 by 10, 5, or 1 (depending on how low the reps were already:  bigger drops when the reps are high; smaller drops when reps are low).  Return to the previous loop, with the current weight replacing W0, and this new number of reps replacing R0.   That progression eventually leads to performing 2 sets of 1 with your near maximum load, though the timing is slightly different for each of the 6 exercises.  The reason for beginning with such high reps (typically 20 for snatches, 60 for squats, 80 for benches) is to 1) develop intuition for the particular lift; and 2) develop muscular endurance.  I find these issues to be oft overlooked but extremely important in lifting heavy:  since so much of lifting is mental, doing thousands of reps early in the cycle with light and medium weight helps you to develop the courage to pull/push heavy; also, especially for olympic lifting, the movements are so long (3 pulls and 3 pushes in a clean/jerk), poor technique due to fatigue, even with low reps, is a genuine concern. "
493,Boxing for Overall Fitness,"I am interested in maintaining overall health but get bored after a few weeks of aimlessly pulling weights and running. I was wondering if I could take up Boxing (or Muay Thai) for overall fitness.  After some thought, I've decided that it sounds fun and I will stay motivated.  Are there any possible medical concerns of boxing? I will not fight/spar though, but I am a PhD student and the last thing I want is brain damage.  I can't do hybrid strategies (like both weights and boxing). If I commit to my boxing coach, he will design my schedules and he is really nice, trust-able and reputed.  In summary, as a PhD student with brain being the only source of income, does it make sense for me to take up Boxing/Muay Thai for my fitness? "

495,What Limits the Repetitions One Can Perform?,"What is the scientific explanation of why one can only do a certain number of repetitions of an exercise before becoming unable to?  For example, at my current state I can only do 8 repetitions of a bench press at 68 lbs, even though I am able to then perform the same motion with no (or less) weight. Why is this? "
496,Achilles heel snapped twice without permanent damage,"Yesterday i was faced with a strange ""injury"". Last week i lightly strained my achilles heel when making a strange twist with my foot. after a week of complete rest the pain fully subsided.  Tuesday i went for a small/slow run. I still felt something odd in the achilles heel but no pain and I could keep on running. I ran 5.5 km (didn't want to overdo it).  Yesterday morning I still wasn't feeling anything so i decided to do a light run in the evening (9.5km). Which is not unusual for me (I normally run 40km+ in a week).  I started running and for the first 6k i did again feel that achilles heel with some very, very slight dull pain. At the 6k mark my achilles heel snapped twice (almost lost my balance) in 30 - 50m. At first a sharp pain but then again the pain disappeared.  At first i panicked. I stopped on the side of the road to see what was wrong. The achilles heel could still support my weight.So I walked some meters but then i was able to run the remaining 3k to home. Constantly feeling a light dull, non-hampering (my tempo didn't suffer) pain.  At home there wens't any redness or inflammation visibile. To be sure I iced it, still feeling the light pain. This morning I awoke with the same light pain.But by now (10 AM) the pain is again gone.  The problem obviously isn't a tear or a rupture in/of the tendon. Any significant injury would have prevented me from continuing the run. Nor can i find any information about the snap (without rupture) on the net.   What happened to tendon to snap like that? Is there something i should worry about?  By snapping I mean the following: It was just like a large amount of pressure suddenly got released by the heel. Like the heel couldn't handle the stress anymore and it give way in an instant, releasing all the stress in a single burst. This gave me the weird sensation of ""falling"" through my foot.   P.S. I have had no Achilles heel injuries prior to this one. Or any other injury in the last 4 months.  P.S. 2: I'm made an appointment with the doctor. But i would still like the input from some seasoned runners. "
497,Why does Dmitry Klokov stagger his feet?,"Dmitry Klokov, olympic medalist and renowned heavyweight lifter, does something very unusual  with his feet in both the snatch and the clean and jerk.  In the below picture, he can be seen with his left foot opened slightly outward compared to his right foot, as well as positioned slightly forward.    Even in the snatch he can be seen using similar positioning of the feet:    In all the videos of him lifting, he can be seen using this staggered stance.  We've heard from DPTs that torque is generated from the hips, so the feet should be as straight as possible in squat movements to help induce more rotational torque.  For Klokov, this apparently has not worked best for him.  As a top tier athlete, I'm sure he has access to some of the best trainers in the world.  Wouldn't this be something they would try to condition out of him?     As one of the most flexible lifters I've ever seen, I'm sure it's not a mobility issue. What's the deal?  Can anyone explain his foot positioning? "
498,Is a mainly cardio based schedule any good?,"Currently I run every morning before work and follow that run up with some Chin-ups, Muscle-ups and Push-ups.   I'm not trying to build muscle with these exercises but I just want to make sure I don't do more damage than good for my body. I run 6 days a week (every morning with the only exception being Saturday since I have to work the night shift).   My run is between 20 - 30 minutes followed by my 'ups' and then a semi-run/walk home. If I do this 6 days a week would this cause my muscles to actually break down instead of rebuilding themselves? I'm not concerned about these cardio exercises but I also go to the gym about 3 days a week. I mainly do core and weight exercises here.   Would this amount of exercise be considered too much?    My gym workout consists of weighted squats, bench presses, kettle swings, dips, pull-ups, and some more varieties. I would say between medium and high intensity. "
499,"What is ""obese""?","If you look at charts they will all say that I'm obese or worse. I'm 6'1"" ~250 (dropping to 240) but I'm not ""fat"".   These charts seem to base it on the fact that my weight vs my height is not in proportion. According to those charts I should be 150-170 (which IMO is far too small. Not to offend anyone.)  Shouldn't this be based on body fat % instead of weight vs height? What body fat % should be considered obese?  Or is the term obese not meaning ""fat"" but ""weight overall relative to what your heart can handle"" which would have those charts making more sense. "
500,Lower trapezius usefulness?,"Almost every back anatomy diagram I see draws a giant trapezius muscle across the upper back. I work out frequently and I would say (for my body type/size) I have rather large ""upper"" traps, but have always wondered about the ""lower"" parts.   It looks like they are always primarily mentioned in the context of scapular ""depression"". However, I have never ""isolated"" or purposefully tried to train ""lower traps"", nor do I feel any ""weakness"" when trying to depress my scapula manually or when doing exercises (such as weighted dips or pullups) that would make use of any scapular-depression musculature. In other words, I feel no ""weakness"" in my lower traps when doing exercises involving scapular depression or that seemingly would invoke lower traps for scapular depression or stabilization.  So, are strong lower traps really that useful for most exercises? Do they need to be isolated, or are they pretty well invoked in any exercises involving traps anyway?  It seems to me like whatever weaknesses one may have in exercises -- such as dips and pullups -- that should make the most use of scapular depression musculature, the trapezius in general seems like the least likely muscle one would commonly need to strengthen in order to progress in those exercises. "
501,"Ketogenic diet , side effects and precautions",I have recently searched about the idea of the ketogenic diet and found it very interesting.

502,migraine after work out,"Short Question Can moderate (sweating) workout trigger migraine?    Details My wife had migraine twice before joining a gym when she was studying in classroom in May 2014 (at a gap of 2+ weeks) and then it never re-triggered. (Was on medications for a week)  Last year (July 2015) I pulled her to my gym. I go for workout early in the morning and we started going together. During July-Sep 2015 she went to gym for about 8 weeks (almost regularly 4-5 times a week) and had migraine triggered for about 7 times within an hour after the exercise (Rough workout schedule: 15 min cardio + 20 min weight training + 10 min stretching/crunches etc). We visited couple of doctors and gym fitness trainers who said exercise can never trigger migraine, and in fact it is helpful in suppressing it. Since then she left the gym, and there was not a single occurrence of migraine.  Yesterday I insisted her to rejoin the workout routine (Partly to stay fit and partly because we paid for the whole year). And asked her to go to gym in the evening instead of morning. She did cycling at mild pace for 10 min and joined a group dance activity for 1 hour. After about an hour of the activity the migraine triggered again.  All the migraine attacks were similar with following flow:   Blurred vision Severe Headache Vomitting Severe headache continues   She loves cycling and dancing for hours and it never causes any issue.  My Question Should my wife immediately stop exercising? Might she be doing something wrong about workout or diet causing this problem? "
503,Should strength training be altered according to whether you're seeking size vs strength?,"When I read about strength training, the advice often comes with the assumption that the reader wants to get ""big"". I want to achieve strength, but would prefer not to increase size too much if possible.  So is there a difference in how one should train to increase muscle size vs how one should train to increase strength? If so, what is the difference? "
504,Are squats a bad idea if you are overweight?,"I wish to lose weight, and was thinking about doing squats to lose weight because they exercise most of the body.  My brother, however, tells me that you shouldn't do squats if you are severely overweight like I am.  Is this true?  And if so, what all can go wrong? "
505,Weakness in weightlifting with Keto Diet,I feel a lot weaker with weightlifting since going ketogentic.... does anyone else have this experience? Are there hacks to get around this? 
506,Could a weighted shirt/vest replace a workout routine?,"A quick Google search lets me see various weighted vests and shirts you can use during workout, but I'm hoping my natural daily activity can replace a workout routine if I am wearing weights. That being said, I'm hoping for something a bit more discrete.  First off, will this work - considering I am underweight, and am eating more/right to allow for growth, will I gain muscle?  Is there a weighted shirt or similar which one could use for everyday wear, perhaps one that looks nearly like a normal shirt? Is there a more discrete option for this? "
507,How does a middle-aged person know when he is over-exercising?,"The middle-aged person is in his early 40s. His sole purpose of exercising is to keep healthy. Looking good and having an attractive body is not a concern. Over-exercising can lead to damage of body parts, particularly when the person is no longer young. How does a a middle-aged person know when he is over-exercising to the extent that he is wearing off his body parts? Body aching?    "
508,Cold Bath After Training - Recovery Techniques,"I am a sprinter around the grand old age of 21.  At our track, there is a lot of debate of whether cold bath (or ice bath if you're brave enough) aids recovery of the muscle. What are your opinions?

511,kickbox aerobics: want to make higher roundhouse kicks,"I'm 41, regular gym visitor for one year, general fitness level ""OK but not great"". Recently I started to enjoy a kickbox aerobics course at my gym. I realized I hardly ever trained such rapid movements (except in soccer), but I'm improving.   However, during the workout I cannot make the roundhouse kicks parallel to the ground without losing control, let alone make high kicks. What should I do to improve that?    Focusing on the muscles in the legs focusing on the core becoming more flexible in general (I know, only slight improvements possible) all of the above.   I think the answer is ""all of the above"". But how to start? Any suggestions for a good compilation of exercises on the gym machines or choosing a supplemental course? What to avoid? "
512,How is the Bulgarian Method so effective?,"Given that we need to give our bodies ample rest between workouts, how is the Bulgarian Method so successful (or successful at least for the lifters who trained under Ivan Abadjiev)?  Is it purely because of ""recovery agents?""  Or does the body just adapt to the continuous workouts and magically speeds up the recovery rate? "
513,Metabolic Equivalent of Task (MET) values for exercises with rest,"I'm trying to figure out what MET values for various exercises mean. Cardio exercises seem pretty clear to me: 6 MET for bicycling means that one hour of bicycling for a person weighing 70 kg burns 6 * 70 = 420 kcal.  However, what about exercises such as weight lifting, where you need to rest between sets? Are MET values calculated to include rest or not? For example, I see in many charts that MET for weight lifting is 6. If the person weighing 70 kg trains for one hour, lifting for one minute and then resting for one minute (so the total lifting time is 30 minutes), does he burn 420 kcal or 210 kcal? "
514,Which exercises best treat an existing runners knee injury,"What easy and effective exercises exist to treat an existing runners knee injury?  Runners knee often occurs when quadriceps are too weak to support the knees. Thigh-strengthening exercises are needed. Some exercises, such as lunges, might not be appropriate for existing knee injuries since it might cause pain and make it worse.     So far in my research I came across CoolRunning, suggesting    Standing Leg Lifts: Stand with your back against the wall. Lift one leg up as high as you can with the knee straight. Hold for five seconds, then bend your knee to relax, hold for five seconds. Straighten your leg again, and do five of these before switching to the other leg. Over time, see if you can build up to ten seconds. Foot Turns: Lie down or sit in a chair and stretch both legs out, knees straight and feet pointed up toward the knees. Tighten your thigh muscles and turn your feet out as far as you can, holding for ten seconds. Now turn your feet in as far as you can and hold for ten seconds, keeping your thigh muscles tight for the entire exercise. Do three of these sets. Foot Press: Either sitting or lying down, put one foot on top of the other and pull up with your lower foot as you push down with the upper foot. Hold that for ten seconds, and then switch feet and repeat. Try five sets of these.   Do you agree with these suggestions? "
515,"Lost 60kg, went too extreme and caused damage? Feeling overwhelmed","Sorry for the weird title, I could not find a better way to phrase it. Also not the best in english, but I will try my best.  About me: 23 years old Male 178~ cm 82kg 20%+ bodyfat  Just a quick history about me, since that will be very relevant to my question, I will make it quick as possible, I promise:  -Overweight from childhood until age 16, where I was at 120kg  -Lost 50kg from age 16 to 17, via horrible starvation (literally eating around 300-500 calories, almost no protein)  -Could not maintain of course, but wanted to get leaner  -Continued to try so with the extreme approach, having no idea of anything. Ended up binge eating and getting psychological issues because of it.  -Cared about nothing and went full 'self destruction' mode  -Went from 70kg to 140kg from age 17-19, mostly started with creating the habit to binge (by dieting that extreme) + psychological feeling completely defeated  -Stayed at that weigh from age 19 to age 20  -Realized that this was no way to live, went with an extreme diet again from age 21 to age 22, all was going well until I hit around 90kg  -There the extreme approach was just not working again and I developed binge eating once again, which ended in a horrible cycle of extreme restriction and then binge eating  -Still managed to get down to 75kg, by continued extreme dieting. By that time I was using PSMF, so it was more 'smart', still had a lot of binges, but I got down that lean and was reasonably lean (something like 15-17%). I reached the 75kg around 6 months ago.  -From there on I could not maintain once again of course and kept on yoyo-dieting, now I'm up to 82kg. 8 weeks ago I upped calories and went with a smaller deficit(500-1000 maybe), still could not really maintain that. Was frustrated and went with PSMF again after 4 weeks at a smaller deficit + overeating. Did that for 2 weeks, realized I just could not do this anymore, and it was getting me nowhere. That was 4 weeks ago.  -4 Weeks ago I upped calories to around maintenance, the first 2 weeks I was actually under it I think. For the last 2 weeks, I have been eating several days over maintenance (think 2000-3000 calories over) and some days just around it. I just could not take the hunger anymore. This is going on until today, and I'm afraid I have done some serious damage to my hormones, appetite etc. by my history. I still have the urge to overeat on most days, even though I have been in a 14,000 calorie surplus in the last 2 weeks.    Now the question and the Issues: How can I recover my metabolism without getting fat again? So I can smartly set up an approach to get to a healthy bodyfat.  My goal is clearly to get to a healthy bodyfat, but as of right now, my hunger still seems elevated, and I have to honestly say, this is really overwhelming and scary to me.   I has GREATLY improved in the last 2 weeks, I have better well-being, not cold all the time, actually feel like I'm alive and I don't have the urge to have anything like those 10,000 calorie binges anymore, BUT at the same time, I was in a surplus of around 14,000 calories in the last 2 weeks. I'm far from 'recovered' I think, but gained noticeable fat. Was at 78kg 4 weeks ago, now at around 82kg, water was gained too, but fat also, no doubt.  I'm afraid I will have to get more fat to recover properly, but this thought does seem not right to me, since I'm already at a unhealthy bodyfat and I frankly don't want to get fatter, since that can't be good (physiological and of coursy psychological too)  So, I was thinking to recover my hormones to a healthy baseline and then continue to diet, this time smartly, with a very small deficit, refeeds, breaks etc. I count calories too, have been doing so for the last 3 years almost. Lifting for around 1 year now.   How would you guys go into this? What do you think about my case?    I don't expect anyone to have read what I just wrote, it got much longer than I wanted, and I can totally understand if you don't feel like taking the time to read all this.  I'm very grateful for anyone that is willing to help here, since I feel very alone on this and overwhelmed right now, because it does cause me quite a bit of stress I have to admit.  Thank you! "
516,Climbing Stairs and Calories Burnt,"I climb stairs to work (20 floors) every day . The least amount of work my body is doing my gaining potential energy (P.E) = mgh where m is mass , g is acc. due to gravity and h is height . Assuming every floor is 1 metre high . Mass -> 70kg Work Done Comes out to 70*10*20 = 14000J . 1 calorie = 4.2 Joules . So I am burning somewhere around 3000 calories . Right ? But this calculation seems way off . I do not feel this tired after climbing 20 floors . What am I missing ? Thanks. "
517,Compare & contrast squat types,"I am transitioning from a beginner program (5x5 Stronglifts) to an intermediate programme. Lots of exercise regimes recommend squats, but what is more suitable for developing:   Powerlifting? Hypertrophy?   I am currently doing a high back squat but the following are appearing in intermediate programmes, what are their benefits/focus?   Box Sumo Front Hack Overhead  "
518,Is this program suited for strength end moderate growth?,"I'm doing bodyweight excercises for some years now with mediocre results (I know that the results can be way better when lifting, but due to time constraints, doing BWE at home is the way to go for me). To improve my results and accomodate my restrictions I made up my own program based on my experiences with YAYOG and Start Bodyweight, considering how my body reacts to different types of stimuli.  Basically my program is a split routine with workouts on four days a week (monday, tuesday, thursday, friday - for what it's worth), dedicating two days to push/pull excercises and two days to core/legs. More or less I will build my program upon the progressions from start bodyweight, e.g. start with assisted pull-ups, then eccentric pull-ups, normal pull-ups, etc.   I will do four sets of each progression, the first one being a warm-up set with a decreased load (e.g. 3/4 push-ups) and the subsequent normal sets with full load (e.g. normal push-ups). I will aim at 8-12 reps per set, gradually increasing reps until I reach the 12 reps, then proceed to the next excercise from the progression. I know that it's little rest, but I'll aim at sets of two minutes.  Workouts:   Day 1: Push-up, Pull-up, Pike Push-up, Australian pull-up Day 2: Squat, Leg-raise (or ring crunch), (missing), Plank (maximum holding time) Day 3: Push-up, Pull-up, Dips, Autralian pull-up Day 4: repeat day 2   My aim is to build strength and moderate muscles. Is there anything to improve with this program? Are there any seriaous flaws? What additional leg excercise can I incorporate in day 2/4? "
519,Muscular tiredness from biking -- is it endurance related?,"I bike every now and then, but used to ride bike quite often before. One thing that never has changed is how I get dead tired instantly. The tiredness is muscular and it's all in the legs, like a muscular ache.  Someone told me you have to fight through the tiredness to gain endurance, but I would bike nearly every single day for 3-10 miles and the result would be worn-out legs that would continue to get tired on the next biking activity in the same amount of time I would get tired in the last one. Basically, no change.  I am resting and stretching, eating well, and doing everything I should be, just to note. I've always hated how I would bike with friends and they would keep going and going and I would need to take breaks.  I can't fathom what the issue could be. Why would I never get adapted to biking? Why are my leg muscles just dying out in a mere matter of seconds of pedaling? I do other leg exercises, but spread them all out so I don't overwork, like squats sometimes and lunges, deadlifts, etc., etc., etc.  I have noticed that my legs never build endurance to last without pain. Basically, I can push myself, but I'll just have excessive pain. If I ride comfortably to avoid the pain, I'd have to pedal extremely slow and wouldn't be much faster than walking. I have tried some of the best bikes there are with full air in the tires, correct seating position from pedals for my height, etc. No matter what, my legs drain out fast.  I have tried low speed-settings and tried to work my way up, but after the same speed is reached, I end up having to use too much force to keep up the speed, and it becomes the repeated problem again.  I hate this because I see people riding bike all day and never saying a word about leg tiredness. My legs are not weak and I can squat almost 260 lbs. all the way down and all the way up raw.  What are some ways I can train my legs to not get tired from this? I've tried biking less often than once a day, but no avail. I tried stretching before and after, but nothing; still dead tired if I pedal too much.  I'm not trying to go too fast nor too slow; this issue is just with going anything faster than snail speed (anything consistently over 5 MPH). It starts off like a very minuscule amount of muscle aching, but turns to pain if I keep it up, especially the next few days when it's that light but miserable muscle aching.  Basically, I am feeling beyond the pain, but not seeing the gain. I've done this steadily for 2-4 months. "
520,Ball vs heel strike when walking or light jogging?,"I've found I have two different foot usages when I walk, stride or lightly jog/run.   Sometimes I touch down with the heel first. I either roll or more usually, tread/lift. Other times I extend the ball of my foot as the foot approaches the ground, and it acts as shock absorption (the heel doesn't touch or barely touches throughout). This feels like it puts less strain on the foot and heel area and is comfortable.  I'm equally comfortable with all of them.  What are their differences in terms of health, efficiency, impact effect, and either improved tone or adverse effect on the muscles and joints? Should I prefer any of them over another?  Note on context - I'm not a runner nor a jogger; I walk a lot and stride heavily (long and fast distance-consuming stride), and sometimes lightly run/jog. Sometimes I'm carrying extra weight such as a heavy backpack or shoulder bag at the same time. So I'm not really looking at serious running or jogging fitness, more for general but ongoing all-the-time daily practices. Answers covering running are welcomed but if they are more geared to my use it would be better. "
521,How to 'engage your core'?,"I found when exercising (through Kinect, pilates video, etc) that I am asked to 'engage my core'. How do I do this? How do I know when I am truly engaging my core rather than just sucking in my stomache? "
522,60-year old dad passes out after 1/2 an hour of badminton,"My dad is 60 years old. I have never played any kind of sports for 30 years.  However, he's working with geography and sometimes (maybe a week per month) he has to hike in the jungle as a part of his job.  Recently, a heart doctor prescribed medication for him. He now takes a heart pill every morning.    Today, he told me he wants to play badminton with me. This is the 1st time he played sports. So we played for 30 minutes. Then suddenly he felt tired and he sat down. Then, right at that time, I saw he fell asleep. I tried to call him but he didn't wake up. So I rushed out and call an ambulance, but my dad suddenly woke up.  He just passed out for 5 minutes. He told me that his doctor said he should do the walking exercise only.  My question is that ""Is badminton too much for 60-year old person?""  And ""What should I do now?""   Tell him to stop playing badminton Tell him to do the walking exercise only   I am very worried for him. I thought he could have a stroke. I thought since he took the heart pills everyday, that could help him recover. "
523,Home workout exercises with minimal equipment,"I'd like to start doing workouts with the goal of becoming stronger, building endurance, and being more fit in general.(Also, I don't currently need to worry about losing weight, 5'6"" 125 lbs.) Why these goals? To feel better about myself and for the lady ;)... I'm not really into getting ""big"" - I'd rather the physical exercise I do give me strength I could use day-to-day.  Unfortunately, the biggest challenge I have is my lack of knowledge, followed by a lack of equipment. It isn't very practical for me to go to the gym (it is too far away for me to actually do it consistently)  What exercises should I be doing at home to become stronger and build endurance? Also, what stretching exercises should I be doing to avoid injuries?  So far, I've pretty much just been doing sporadic push-ups, sit-ups, jumping jacks - I'm trying to come up with a routine I can do 5 days a week. The only equipment I have at the moment are a set of 10lb. dumbbells  (Just to point out how little I know - I just learned what ""squats"" are, so please explain everything as well as possible) Maybe not necessarily how to do the exercises, I can look that up, but make sure I understand what muscles certain exercises should help me with and any other little tips I probably wouldn't know.

524,Boosting Testosterone with exercise?,Can you really increase Testosterone by exercising in certain ways?  What kind of exercise routines support higher testosterone levels?  How aligned with boosting Testosterone is increasing mass?  How does a program focusing on Testosterone differ?

525,How do I find exercise / jogging trail difficulty?,"I'm interested in starting out jogging. I live in California (northern CA and occasionally southern CA).  Are there any resources / websites that will identify and categorize local exercise and jogging trails by difficulty, such as length of the trail, the inclination, and the surface? Are there standardized metrics for these characteristics? "
526,"Not straight angle in Sumo/Plie squat hinting of inflexibility in groins, hips, back or elsewhere?",I am trying to understand the reason for the angle in plie/sumo squat:    where I think I get more angle than the girl here.   What can cause the angle in sumo squat? Is it due to poor hips flexibility and/or groins flexibility? 
527,"""Triceps"" dips completely alleviate shoulder pain?","I'm no expert in glenohumeral anatomy, but I've noticed that if I do ""triceps-style"" bar dips, I have no pain nor impingement in the shoulder joint whatsoever. This is the version of dips where the elbow go as far back as possible, almost as if they're trying to touch one another, as opposed to ""chest-style"" bar dips, where the elbows are much more flared out to the sides.  But, taking a look at the skeletal structures of the shoulder joint, I see no reason why moving the humerus ""backwards"", as opposed to just flaring it out to the sides, should somehow make the movement a lot more impingement-less (mainly across the AC joint, which seems to be the most likely source of impingement).  Granted, a simple ""skeletal/ligament"" view may omitting some other important detail as well --- if my elbow is pointed backwards (with scapulae retracted), I can move the elbow upwards only so far (I cannot raise my elbow above my shoulder joint when it's pointed behind me, for example).  So, are there actually other structures in place (e.g., muscle tissue) that could be keeping 'triceps' dips from hurting the shoulder joint? My best guess so far is just deltoids, traps, and the long triceps head simply all bumping into each other thereby blocking any pain-causing or impingement-causing ranges of motion.  Edit: According to the image below, what exactly prevents sagittal shoulder extension a full 360°? Is it the stretching of the deltoids, or some occlusion between the rear muscle groups bumping into one another, or something else? Since whatever it is, it allows me to do triceps dips comfortably with no pain or impingement whatsoever.  "
528,Will weight lifting affect speed and flexibility?,"I am 22 years old, weighing around 70 kg and 5ft 11 inches in height. I want to gain strength overall and i have some concerns on choosing weight lifting  to achieve this.   I have started training MMA and i have reasonable speed and flexibility as of now and i expect to increase them with further training. Meanwhile I also want to increase strength without affecting the speed and flexibility. I am concerned that i will lose speed and flexibility if I do weight lifting to increase my strength. Will I gain more weight by weightlifting? How will it affect my speed and flexibility? "
529,Depleting Muscle Glycogen and Fat Burning,Suppose I do the following exercise:  As many body weight squats as possible in 1 minute without stopping with a 10 second rest. Repeat 15 times.  Would this deplete the muscle glycogen in my legs? What impact would this have on overall fat burning? 
530,Bulk or cut? (pics),"I don't know anymore.  Info: 20/M/165(75kg)/6'1/16%BF(omron fat loss monitor).   I've been dieting since February (175lb/79kg), and began losing weight two weeks later (when I bought a food scale). I was eating around 1300cals a day, coupled with 17min HIIT and sloppy lifting (apartment complex gym, only did 1x30/30lb chest press, 1x40/60 leg curls).   By the end of the week, I would lose around 1.5lb. Then decided to go all out and get a gym membership and do the Push/Pull/Legs (PPL) program. Two weeks ago I stalled at 165lb(75kg) and got upset and decided to go a little more extreme (I probably messed up my calories that week anyway or my body adjusted, who knows) and do 1000cals or under/a day. Last week I dropped from 165lb(75kg) to 162(73.5kg). Waiting until Saturday for the next weigh in.  My PPL stats:  (I still don't know how much the barbell weighs in my gym so these could be way higher or lower. Just added 20lb to everthing to be safe.)    Deadlifts: 60lb(27kg)    Barbell rows: Tomorrow.    Seated cable rows: 60lb/27kg(?)    Face pulls: 35lb(17kg)    Hammer curls: 25lb(11kg)    Dumbbell curls: 25lb(11kg)    Bench press: 50lb(22kg)    Overhead press: 40lb(18kg)    Incline dumbbell press: 40lb(18kg)    Triceps pushdowns: 35lb(17kg)    Lateral raises: 25lb(11kg)    Overhead triceps extensions: 20lb(9kg)    Squat: 50lb(22kg)    Romanian Deadlift: 50lb(22kg)    Leg press: No free weights, the sled is heavy already.    Leg curls: 80lb/36kg(?)    I'm cutting because I want to get rid of this gut and thighs that are really annoying. Then I will have well defined muscle tone. But some people are saying to bulk and the gut will go away or do a small bulk and revamp(?). I don't know what's going on anymore.  What should I be doing for my end goal? "
531,"Do the principles behind the shakeweight and related products work? (a lot of quick, short impulse muscle contractions)","I got a shakeweight as a gag gift for Christmas. I actually tried it and it does feel like you get a work out from the instructional DVD.   I'm curious if the principles behind the product are sound? Can you really build muscle through the quick, impulses of muscle contractions that device requires? Can I actually look like the guy in the video from doing just Shakeweight? "
532,Burning calories: Using elliptical type equipment,"While ellipticals offer stationary movement with low impact on the knees, they also seem to offer burning off insane amounts of calories when compared to equal time/work on a treadmill.  Same brand equipment, similar workout profiles  ~200 calories 30 minutes on a treadmill  ~670 calories 30 minutes on an eliptical ~200 calories 30 minutes on a bike   I've heard from many different sources including personal trainers both sides that ellipticals are great for burning calories and also that they are just lies.  The equipment I have at home all have a calorie counter that continues to climb even if i'm stationary. It's making assumptions about my effort to determine calories burned so I dont believe either one.  The equipment at gyms ask for weight, height and even use your heart rate to determine your calories burned.   The spread between the treadmill and the elliptical calories burned readings both from my home equipment and the gym equipment are very similar.   What is the truth? Does the eliptical really just burn 2-3 times more calories per session than a treadmill? "
533,Best way to breathe for long-distance running,"What is the best way to breathe while running long-distance? One can breathe in through the nose only, the mouth only, or both nose and mouth.

I am eating protein 40%, fat 35%, carbs 25% as instructed by my weight-loss coach and RD. My BMR is 2700-3600 cals/day.    I am gaining weight but I don't think the weight I have gained is muscle. How much protein should I be eating?   I know for serious bodybuilders and weightlifters its at least 1-to 1 ratio or more, but what should it be for me?. "
535,Device to train abs while sitting,"I was looking today and I saw that there is a device to train abs without exercising. I'd like to know if should I buy something like this to strengthen and define my abs? I have a normal body fat value with little visible abs. Is a good idea to buy this?

536,How to prevent getting nauseated during workouts?,"Last night at the gym, I apparently pushed myself a little too hard, and I threw up all over the shower.  I'd rather not do that again, so:   What causes this? What can I do to increase how much work I can do without throwing up?  "
537,Optimize single dumbbell routine?,"Hi fellow fitness enthusiasts and personal trainers.  Thanks to my gym closing down and me moving, I'll need to train at least 6 months without a gym.  At home I have a 15kg dumbbell. Since I'm not very strong, this will be enough at least for biceps, triceps and shoulders.  This is my routine I'm using now (all using just this one dumbbell)     Biceps:    Sitting biceps curl    Standing biceps curl    Hammer curl      Triceps:    Overhead push      Shoulders:    Lateral raise    Front raise    Dumbbell shoulder press    Back fly      Chest:    One arm chest press      Back:    Back row   In this exact order. Not training legs because I'm running and cycling quite a lot.  Do you have any tips to optimalize this routine/things I'm doing wrong?  My goal is muscle growth and I was wondering if I could achieve this with this routine? "
538,HOW should I do running intervals for martial arts?,"TL;DR: Exactly HOW should I do running intervals to supplement Muay Thai?  I'm a relative beginner at Muay Thai (and, compared to many people here, a casual one who only trains 2X/week) and am interested in adding more conditioning work to my non-training days. I think my level of conditioning is currently not too bad, since I seem to have good staying power in class. Before taking up Muay Thai, I was doing various forms of cardio including (at various points) boxing, swimming, and treadmill intervals. The treadmill intervals had been 60 sec on/60 off for 8-9 rounds, where the ""on"" part was running ~7.8 mph at a 10% incline and the ""off"" part was brisk walking also at a 10% incline.  I am specifically interested in running-based intervals because 1) it's convenient (the Muay Thai gym is far away, so training more often isn't possible right now), and 2) I am also lifting (Starting Strength), which I need desperately, and feel that barbell-based conditioning will interfere more than running.   I found some other great existing answers on this topic, but none address the 4 more specific questions I am about to ask:   Something about cardio in general Something about intervals in general Something about running for BJJ   Here are the parameters I need advice on:  1.) Session length  For example, 7 minutes of intense hill sprinting? Or 20 minutes of something less grueling?  2.) Work : rest time ratio  Equal work and rest? Tabata? etc.  3.) Work : rest intensity ratio  To use the limiting cases, should I run some short distance like a mile as fast as possible at a steady speed? Alternate all-out sprinting and walking? Or somewhere in between?  4.) Hills/incline vs. flat  Self-explanatory. "
539,Weight loss vs. running speed,"So if I want to get fitter and be able to run faster, does trying to lose weight at the same time hinder this?  I've read that on a calorie restricted diet, one has to take care to make sure they are still eating enough protein. Other than that, can trying to lose weight (or I guess, more specifically, trying to lose fat since that's just 'dead weight') by calorie restriction hinder attempts to become fitter and run faster? "
540,What sort of progress should I be expecting with burpee sets?,"So, between 40 and 50 years old, mountain biker weighing about 90kg. No problems doing 100km on an MTB on or off terrain in reasonably quick time frames. Recently (couple of weeks ago) started doing burpees daily. Proper form, full press-up and jump, and initially felt like I was dying doing more than 5 or 6 of them in a set. Am now able to do about 25 in a set before literally feeling unable to jump or breathe properly. I will then go on to finish 30 after a minute pause.  Is this acceptable progress? I am a little discouraged to note that many people on the internet talk of doing 100 burpees in a single set as though it was not a problem, and apparently with no previous experience of doing burpees. Is that level of progress too low, that I should be looking at some possible problem, eg: diet etc? "

544,Why do deadlifts hurt my lower back,"I recently started doing Stronglifts. My bar weighs 40 lbs instead of 45, so here were my starting weights:   Squat: 90 lbs (5RM was 205 earlier in the year) Bench: 90 lbs (5RM was 190 earlier in the year) Deadlift: 90 lbs Row: 60 lbs Overhead Press: 40 lbs   Everything has been easy except deadlifts. I had very small hints of pain even on the first 90-lb day. I got up to 130 lbs yesterday and my lower back started hurting a few hours later and continued through the day. I am only about 90% sure it is not ""normal"" muscle soreness... but 130 lbs should be easy, right?  I have reviewed a lot of material including the Stronglifts articles and the links in this answer. I'm sure my lower back is not rounding.  Note  I already have an idea of what is wrong. I am going to test this next time I deadlift.   My abs are not engaged. I suspect they should be contracted, like when squatting. But why does none of the deadlift material mention this? I might be over-arching my lower back. In fact, this seems to be tied to the abs: if you stand up and tilt your pelvis forward (so that your butt sticks out slightly), flexing your abs will bring your spine back to a more natural position.  "
545,Is vigorous drumming an effective exercise?,"From the ""any exercise is better than no exercise"" perspective, I'd imagine that playing drums at high tempo would be considered effective - it certainly can work up a sweat and obviously must burn more calories than just sitting on the couch, but it's hard to say how effective it actually is without hard numbers. Are there any reliable sources which can provide MET or actual calorie burn data by which we could compare drumming with other exercises?  Also, while it's obviously physically taxing beyond a certain level of skill, does drumming actually raise the heart rate enough to really count as cardio? "
546,Inmate workouts,"This question is being asked for my friend who is an inmate. ""I have gone from doing 1000 push ups every day (what else is there to do here?) with Sat/Sun rest days. To doing 1000 on Monday and Thursday with 2 day rests in between.  Feel that I am losing any gains from original plan.  Which is the better routine?""  "
547,How to best physically prepare for Snowboarding?,"Hello I am preparing for snowboarding season.  I'm generally in decent shape but want to target exercises that would prepare me to snowboard comfortably for many hours.  Last season my legs especially would give up on me sooner than I would like in the day. Plus about half way down the hill I'd have to stop until the legs stopped burning. Would like to go for 4,5,6+ hours and without needing to stop halfway down the hill. Snowboarding at speed and doing hard turns, but not really doing jumps, on a roughly 500 foot hill.   I'm pretty sure the main exercise I should add to my routine is squats, but how many should I aim to be able to do? With weight? Other exercises or things to consider?  Thanks! "
548,Tightness in tendon - what can I do to fix it?,"I have been running for about two years now, on and off, and recently I have had a mild - but annoying - pain behind my right knee.  I went to an orthopedist, who gave me a cortizone shot, but told me it was most likely a tendonitis.  Since then, I've determined that the tendon which runs behind my leg - on the outside - is unbelievably tight on the right leg (I determined this by comparing with my left leg).  When I say ""unbelievably tight"", I mean to the point that a nurse thought it was initially a bone.  Now I am still able to run, but that nagging pain is always there, whether I run or not.  What can I do to loosen this tendon? I mean in terms of stretches, exercises, even medicinal treatments.  Do I need to see a doctor, or is this mild enough to take care of on my own?  Thanks for any help.  Also, I don't know the exact name of the tendon, but from various pictures on Google, I would guess it's the hamstring tendon. "
549,"How to use equipment in outdoor ""fitness stations""?","Councils in my city have started installing what I think of as adult playgrounds, things called ""fitness stations"" or ""outdoor exercise equipment"" apparently that have unusually shaped static objects and machines.  For example, [website]Strangely I've found it difficult to find people suggesting fun &amp; safe ways to use this equipment.  The manufacturers and installing councils don't seem to suggest ways to use the equipment online.  The more complex machines seem to make sense as their form implies natural kinds of use (rowing, skiing, cycling) that are limited in their movement.  The simpler machines, like an oblique twist seat, don't imply their function because they seem useable in so many ways to me.  The static objects seem even stranger to me, as an angle bar about waist/knee height could be used in any number of ways.  So could three upright poles at ankle-knee height.  I assume each object has an implied function or set of functions that's beyond me.  The only source I could find for suggested methods of using these devices was one authority's video'd sessions (  , [website]Sometimes installed equipment have panels explaining their use, but these rapidly degrade to unreadable due to graffiti, sun exposure or rain exposure.  I assume that there are ""go to"" works in print for enjoying these objects, because there don't seem to be compilations online.  I have no health or fitness goals, I'm just interested in safely playing on the new equipment I keep seeing while cycling. "
550,Stretch to Improve Arm Closing Flexibility,"I'm noticing as I build muscle that it's harder for me to close my arm all the way -- the motion you would use to touch your fist to your shoulder.  I've noticed little things so far:    it's harder to reach my collar to insert collar stays when I do bench presses, as I get near the bottom of my lift, I can feel the stretch in my arm where I couldn't before   What are good stretches to improve my flexibility here? Am I looking for tricep stretches? General arm stretches? "
551,Exercise for the face muscles,"Do exercises for the face muscles actually change it? I know that they won't reduce the fat locally, but if our face muscles are like other muscles, they should adapt to a higher load. So is it all hogwash or do some of the work? "
552,What is the difference between protein supplements and branch chain amino acid supplements?,What is the difference between protein supplements and branch chain amino acid supplements?  Isn't protein composed of amino acids?  Are there scientific studies showing the benefits of BCAA supplement as compared to protein supplements? 
553,Is engaging your core really about posture?,"I hear the phrase engage your core all the time, and honestly, I've never really understood what people saying it are trying to get me to do, and the answers to the question How to 'engage your core'? don't communicate enough detail for me.  Nathan Wheeler's answer describes stability and smooth motion as the goals, but I can achieve both stability and smooth motion without doing anything that feels like I'm using or ""engaging"" my core. So I'm still left with questions.  For a long time I've interpreted it to mean contract your abs or suck in your stomach, but these don't feel right to me.   Contract your abs. When I simply contract my abs, it tends to pull my body into a slight arc, with my chest dropping, my shoulders coming forward, and my back rolling ever so slightly. My intuition tells me this is not an athletic posture because it makes it more difficult to move with control and agility. Suck in your stomach. When I try sucking in my stomach, it has a tendency to inhibit my ability to breathe freely and deeply. My intuition says this isn't right either.   So what does it really mean to engage your core? An article about engaging your core from a yoga perspective suggests that it's really about posture.     When all the muscles of the trunk work together harmoniously, we have   good posture while static (meditating) or moving (everyday activities   as well as asana practice).   From this I came up with my own interpretation: to maintain good posture in an exercise, keeping a long torso with the lower abs and lower back slightly taut—you might even say engaged ;). In more detail, to me this means:   Keeping the chin raised and gaze high, rolling the shoulders back slightly, and lifting your chest. Further elongating your torso and pulling in your lower abs slightly, but opposing that by also activating your lower back muscles for stability.   To me this is all about elongating your torso, keeping it stable, and being contracted enough to take a light punch to the abs. (Not because taking a punch is particularly important, but because that helps me think about which muscles I should be activating.)  What still bothers me about my latest interpretation is that the particular sequence of words ""engage your core"" fails to imply anything about posture.  The question  So, do I have it right? Is engaging your core really about posture? "
554,Egg whites and yolks,"I recently watched a program on a bodybuilding website, and something in the diet plan struck me as quite weird.  It said, that in the breakfast, you should eat 8 egg whites, but no yolks. That struck me as odd, since you have to waste a lot of money to get just the whites. Later on, a discussion on a board turned to flame wars, over this issue. So, the question:  When training, should you also eat egg yolks, or just whites?  Is there a science behind this theory, or is it just plain imagination/tradition/etc. ? "
555,The value of strength training vs. the time/effort it takes,"I've been working out with a mixture of strength training and cardiovascular exercise (and some stretching), and wanted to better assess to what degree the strength training is worth the time and effort.  My exercise goals goals, in order of importance (1 is most important):   To live long and with a high quality of life (includes cognitive benefits, ability to use my body effectively long term, avoiding medical problems, etc.) To feel healthy and have better energy, mood, thinking, body comfort. To be able to eat closer to the amount I enjoy without gaining excess fat. To have a reasonably good male physique.    Let's say that (1) is more than 50% of my motivation--so I clearly want to the cardiovascular component.  Given these priorities, is strength training (pull ups, bench press, preacher curls, tricep push-downs, mostly) really worth the extra time and effort, since they might mostly contribute a little to (3) and mostly to (4)?  Or would people state that strength training is important for (1) and (2) as well, and therefore are worth the extra perhaps 30-40 min in each gym session?  Or, would they say that they mainly target (3) and (4), but really, it's not that much time for the benefits to (3) and (4) and therefore it really is worth it? "
556,Cold kidneys after exercise,"After running or cycling when it's not all that warm outside the area around my kidneys (just above waistline, at the sides, towards the back) is particularly cold and stays cold for longer than the rest of my body. Is this normal? Is it part of the kidney function or just my 'lovehandles' radiating heat? "
557,Avoid chest exercises for flat chest,"My goal is to have flat chest. Something in line with what Paul Walker has in this picture.  From my general observation, I have found that surfers &amp; swimmers have that kind of physique specially flat chest.  Unfortunately it's not possible for me to become either. I swim once per week (Sunday) and workout 5 days per week (excluding swimming).  It would be great to know if I am on right track. Or Am I doing something wrong? Or should I be doing something different?  Here's the summary of what I am doing to achieve my goal.   I am 5""11 and weigh 162 lbs. I neither want to gain weight nor lose any.   Diet - eating vegetarian salads &amp; stir fry (Olive oil) vegetables 4 days per week (no dressings, no cheese but I do add tofu). For 2 days of the week I eat normal protein and carbs rich food.  I make Sundays a cheat day and eat anything I want but in limited quantity.  I avoid doing bench press, push-ups and if I do then I do with very light weights because I have seen that my chest is usually pumped after doing above exercises. Concentrate on Biceps, Shoulder, abs and legs. Whey Protein isolate shake (30 grams of protein) every day. I started above routine in November 2010 have lost around 2.35 inches from my belly but have not notices much difference in my chest.  "
558,Pain in fingers when playing golf,"I play golf from time to time and I've found recently that I get some pain in my fingers.  I'm right handed and the pain normally starts in the joints in the fingers of my left hand and eventually spread to my right hand as well. This was more noticeable to me today as I was hitting balls at a driving range and so hitting balls more frequently.  Is there something I can do to avoid this pain? Am I gripping to hard - I do have a fairly fast swing? Or is this possibly just early signs or arthritis? I am in my twenties, but have a history of this in my family. "
559,How do I lose muscle and fat in my thighs?,I am struggling with how thick and large my thighs are and I really want to slim them down. How do I do this? I power walk on the treadmill for an hour a day and sometimes I do endurance running but I have yet to see results. Also how should I eat? I am doing intermittent fasting and trying to eat less protein and carbs and more fiber as well as a little more healthy fat. Any help is much appreciated. Thanks! 
560,Is calories in vs. calories out 100% the same for every individual?,"It's often touted that body mass is all calories in and out -- that nothing else has any play besides calories. What about things like stimulants with calorie surplus? Testosterone boosters? Different foods? Exercise types? Genetics? Compounds? Many things speed up/slow metabolism so I'd figure you could get the benefits of increased nutrition and nutrient + calorie surplus while calories still exceed TDEE and not gaining body fat. I ask because some people will say it's just in and out and nothing else matters, but I don't think the body is 100% this simple -- and it will vary based on different genetics and a myriad of other factors.  Some people exponentially gain muscle on diets and never seem to get fatter -- for example, gaining LBM while keeping solid, six pack abs. That's one good sign that bodyfat isn't going up and may even go down over time too.  Others bloat up and eat slightly above maintenance and mostly get fatter. I've heard this is related to P-ratios -- how the body utlizies protein for muscle synthesis vs. just storing it as fat.  All things are never EQUAL. This is why some guys look good after cutting and can even gain muscle/lose fat on minimal splits and not make massive diet changes.  Some guys eat everything right and workout, and barely gain muscle -- others eat crappy and have more muscle despite not working out as often. Calories in vs. out cannot be the only thing at play.  So no two bodies are alike. How could calories in vs. calories out be 100% equal for all then?  Stimulants have the ability to make the metabolism faster, but do not affect nutrient absorption per se. Given such, one could temporarily eat high calorie food and still lose fat and gain muscle over time because stimulants increase things like lipolysis, heart rate, blood flow, nervous system, etc.  In short, it would seem fat loss/muscle gain are not two ends of equal coins and do not 100% respond in all individuals directly to the exact proportion of calories on a day-to-day basis. I'm not saying calories don't matter, as they're  really important.  But isn't it wrong to say they're 100% of the picture when evidence disagrees based on individuality and different body responses?  What are all of the factors really involved in whether one gains, loses, or etc., and to what degrees? "
561,Change grip between sets?,"Is it useful to change the grip between sets?  If I'm doing lat pulldown or seated rows, is it helpful to switch from narrow to wide grip between sets?  Or am I diluting the value of doing multiple sets of one exercise? "
562,Fruit juice or water?,"Can water be replaced with fruit juice?  So instead of drinking a certain amount of water daily, would it be better to get your H2O from fruit juices?  Edit 1:  How about veggi juice? "
563,"Pull-ups: Pain on shoulder joint when lowering body - how to recover from, and prevent or avoid?","I just started doing pull-ups about two weeks ago on a pull-up bar (the one that fits on a doorframe - similar to this).  A day after I started, I got muscle pains all over my shoulder and upper arm. I stopped doing pull-ups for two days, until the muscle pains were gone.     I continued doing pull-ups daily afterwards, but two days earlier, I felt pain in my right shoulder joint when I am lowering my body. It also gets painful when I raise my right arm up. The pain is bearable and is not that intense. It only gets painful when I am lowering my body from a pull-up position and when raising my right arm up.    I decided to stop pull-ups for one day - the pain stopped too, even when raising my right arm. I continued doing pull-ups today but I again felt pain in my right shoulder joint when lowering my body.   How do I recover from the pain? Also, how do I prevent or avoid the pain from occurring again when doing pull-ups? "
564,Consequences of splitting up training runs?,"If a training program tells you to run say 5 miles one day, what are the consequences of splitting up that run? Is there some gray area where you can reap the same/most benefits (say splitting run to 4 and 1 VS. 5 one-milers)? Studies to show the difference would be great.  If you are marathon training and your run that day is 20 miles, the point is to get used to running that mileage so I would say splitting the run is detrimental to the training. I think there may be some leeway in the lower mileage zones though? "
565,Does excessive running training like Marathon eat away muscle growth?,"  Alex Viada possesses the incredible strength of a bodybuilder together with cool-looking muscle.   What's more, his best mile time is a 4:32. His half marathon is 1:31.   A professional long distance runner (like marathon) is usually thin and skinny.   Excessive muscle is considered to be a great burden on Aerobic exercise.   Does excessive running training like Marathon eat away muscle growth?  If, yes. How can Alex Viada do both - bulking muscle while maintaining a super marathon record ? "
566,"Can protein obtained from eating insect totally replace red meat, fish and egg white?","I am training hard and my goal is to build myself into a guy with big muscle.  I know eating properly is something that can't be ignored on my road to success.   I have heard that insects can offer great protein.   So can I eat less meat and consume more insects?   Can protein obtained from eating insect totally replace red meat, fish and egg white?  "
567,BCAA together with whey protein,"I've recently bought BCAA powder, monohydrate creatine and whey protein, and I'm wondering if I'm able to take BCAA together with the whey protein or creatine? I've heard from people you should take BCAA with an empty stomach, some even said you shouldn't take it together with protein.   This was my plan of taking BCAA  Pre-workout:  BCAA   &amp; Whey protein Post-workout: Gainer &amp; Creatine   Is this OK? Or should I switch so it's BCAA + Creatine on pre-workout?  edit  I'm going to bulk for 7 months, and my daily calorie intake is around 3500.  My stats are: Weight=76kg(167 lbs), length=176cm(5 f 9)  The reason why i bought BCAA is because i've heard from my brother it's a great supplement to get gains. The creatine and whey protein i've taken for a year now. "
568,Is it sets per muscle or sets per exercise?,"When doing an exercise with the goal in mind of doing 5 sets per exercise, are those 5 sets for the muscle or for the exercise? Meaning as follows; if i want to do both flat and incline bench presses do I have to divide them so that they equal to 5 sets, or can I do 5 sets per EXERCISE which would result in 10 sets for the muscle?  "
569,Headache when working out,"Recently, I've started getting headaches mainly after leg-pressing on the machine. They used to be pretty short and only last a few minutes, but they got worse and now they last for the full work-out + a few hours after I leave the gym. Has anyone experienced this before? Is there anything I can do about it? "
570,Name of gymnastics move (or variation),"I've been looking into gymnastics and calisthenics moves recently and came across this video of this guy doing some sort of front vertical one-handed lever?  I have never seen this anywhere else and I'm not sure what it's called or what type of training you would do for such a move.  You can see the video of what this guy is doing or have a look at the screenshot below.    I'm curious if this is a ""traditional"" gymnastics move / pose or not and how one would train for such an amazing feat! "
571,"What is changing in my body as I become more fit (i.e., raising my HR @ VT)","I'm getting into a better routine of training regularly and I know I'm getting more fit. I can go for longer at the same rate of exertion that used to blow me out after a couple of minutes. I haven't tested myself recently, but I know that my HR at AT (implied by HR at VT) is higher than it was when I started training a year ago.  (AT is the Anaerobic Threshold - more modernly termed the Lactate Threshold - the point at which lactate starts to build up in the blood; VT is the Ventilatory Threshold - the point at which you start breathing much faster than you were at only a slightly lower level of exertion. VT is much more easily measured than AT or LT, and it serves as a proxy measure for them.)  Here's my question - what is different in my body from a year ago? Do I have more mitochondria? Are they more efficient? Is the chemical balance in my body different? I know the effects of training - I want to know what is actually changing as I get more fit. "
572,Opening up my chest and shoulders,"I've been doing kung fu and tai chi for 3.5 years to date which has helped my posture. I can straighten out my back when I stand, but I still collapse my shoulders forwards when I stand because it's so ingrained. I can consciously open that area up (I like to pretend that I'm Superman getting ready to fly), but eventually I want this to become more natural so that I don't have to put in as much conscious effort as I am now.  I'm a programmer by trade spending a lot of time in front of a computer, but I suspect my hunching posture also comes from some self-esteem and psychological issues from being bullied when I was younger.  What are specific things I can do to work on this area? Will lower back exercises or reversing a hunch help? How would mentality come into play in achieving my goal? "
573,Is there a purpose for this slapping at the top of reps?,"This question led me to this video, apparently of Dejan ""STIPKE"" Stipic, doing various feats of bodyweight strength. In the pull-ups, dips, and squats, there's a fellow beside him who gives a light slap to the limb in action at the top of the motion. You can see it being done with some of the other background athletes as well. Is this a standard thing to do when spotting someone in bodyweight movements? Does this do something physical like help the muscle to relax (seems unlikely to me, since they only seem to be tapping one side) or is this just a way to let the person know they've hit full extension (possibly hard to tell on multiple reps due to muscle engorgement causing numbness)? "
574,Exercises/diet to improve circulation to extremities? (ie for warmth),"I've noticed as I've gotten older that my hands tend to get colder faster when outdoors in the winter. This is especially annoying skiing in the winter where I feel I have to be even more mindful of preventing frostbite then I had to when I was younger. It seems that the general circulation to my extremities has diminished over time.  I'm wondering if there's any exercises or any dietary way I could improve the ability for my body to keep my hands and feet warm? Either long-term preventitive or something I could do right before I go outdoors?  I should add I'm 30, I run regularly (5km most days) and try to eat a fairly reasonable diet. "
575,Does static stretching long term improve exercise performance for trained athletes?,"While looking for research on a slightly different subject, I came across this study, which shows a fairly significant amount of improvement in untrained individuals engaging in a chronic (long term) stretching program.     STR had significant average improvements (P &lt; 0.05) for flexibility (18.1%), standing long jump (2.3%), vertical jump (6.7%), 20-m sprint (1.3%), knee flexion 1RM (15.3%), knee extension 1RM (32.4%), knee flexion endurance (30.4%) and knee extension endurance (28.5%). The control group showed no improvement.   However, it can be argued that for an untrained individual, any kind of muscle stress (Which stretching is), would produce improvements. I was unable to find any studies looking at performance improvements in already trained individuals. There are many that study the effects of acute (short term) static and PNF stretching before performance (Which has been shown to negatively affect power output), however.  Is there a study or other evidence that a long term stretching program provides performance benefits in a trained individual? "
576,When is the best time to do farmer's walking?,When is the best time to do farmer's walking?  Can it serve as a warm-up exercise before squat or bench press?  
577,Rotator Cuff Exercise in The Context Of A 5 Day Workout,"I apologize if this already has an answer, but the wither questions all seemed slightly different, so I’ll give it a shot here and see what I get.  Currently I have a five day work out plan setup like this:   Legs / abs Chest Back/abs Shoulders/abs Arms   I also have some kind of rotator cuff injury that has persisted for awhile.  I don’t know what started it - but the pain is pretty near constant, and ranges from almost non-existent to maybe 7 / 10.  My question is - is it possible to incorporate exercises to help heal it into my current plan.?  Curiously, with the exception of front dumbbell lifts and military presses, the only time it doesn’t seem to hurt is when I’m working out.  I’ve researched some exercises.  Is there a specifically recommended way to incorporate exercises for healing rotator cuff injuries into a regular weight training regimen? "
578,Is the strain on your heart the same if you are overweight due to muscle or fat?,"I believe there is increased strain on your heart if you are overweight due to body fat. However I am overweight due to my muscle mass. Since I started training my BMI has gone from the middle of normal to overweight. I know the BMI should be ignored for adults with high muscle to fat percentage, but I still am overweight, I weigh 81kgs and I am 5ft 11"".  Since muscle needs a lot of blood, is there still extra strain damaging my heart? And if not, why not?  "
579,Is it ok to heel-strike while walking?,"I know that, while running, humans aren't designed to land heel-first, and should, instead, land on the balls of their feet. I've tried this while walking, but it is much more difficult to do, and I'm not sure it even helps anything.  Is it ok to heel-strike while walking? Is it advisable one way or the other? "
580,What is the most scientific way of supplementing body with water during a two-hour gym workout?,DURING A TWO-HOUR GYM WORKOUT    How often does a professional bodybuilder drink water?   How much water is necessary in total?   Does he/she drink in large gulps or in small sips?   Is it a wonderful idea to replace water with some fruit juice or milk?    
581,Psoas Muscles Hurt Using Exercise Ball for a Chair,"Will my psoas muscles stop hurting after using an exercise ball for a chair for a while?   I've been using the exercise ball as a chair for about a week now 4 hours a day at work, and it seems that the muscle it effects the most is my psoas muscles. This is mostly due to the fact that I'm used to slumping in my chair for 8 or 9 hours a day, and using the exercise ball I'm having to make a concentrated effort to sit up straight.  How long will it take for this to stop being so painful, and is it possible that I'm overdoing it with 4 hours a day? "
582,Revised strength building workout - Is this decent? Can it be improved?,"Based on my answers to this question, I have made modifications to my workout and would like input if it is now good or if it can still be improved.  My revised routine is as follows:   10 pushups. 10 situp Short Break 3 sets of 5 reps of dumbbell bicep curls 3 sets of 5 reps of dumbbell deadlifts 3 sets of 5 reps of dumbbell squats Short Break 3 sets of 5 reps of dumbbell overhead press 3 sets of 5 reps of dumbbell bench press   The problems with my previous routine that I was really only working the bicep, which was not ideal for gaining strength in general. I've addressed that by incorporating these additional exercises (I hope).  Assuming this workout is OK, is 3 sets of 5 reps with a heavy weight OK? Should it be less?  Should I strive to do this every day, or every few days? "
583,Pain in Back after lifting body,"I was doing decline bench press with dumb bells, and after exercise i put dumbbell on my chest and tried to lift my body but  middle back felt pain middle of thoracic , my body was not lifted enough for hip extension muscles to be activated, so why I got pain.   Which muslce got activated in back wrongly?  Was not abs supposed to lift my body initially? "
584,Does my workout time have to be consistent?,"How important is it to have a consistent workout time?  If I workout one day at 6am, the next day at 8pm and then the next day at 3pm for example, will this have a negative impact or a negligible impact?  I'm asking in general, although the types of exercises I am doing are pushups, situps and various dumbbell exercises for strength building. "

This happen to 6 pack too.In 8 pack not much difference.My question is if I  continue doing abs my abs become huge? How a guy have huge abs and some others have small abs ,both have visibles abs.(is caused by genetic and that ? Or is variety of different workouts ?what?) .Thanks  "
586,Using energy stored in the body vs eating beforehand,"I often go for a long ride on Saturday mornings, typically riding about 55km before breakfast.  I do the ride before eating anything in the morning. Another friend does the same ride but needs to eat breakfast before we go. He's much fitter and leaner than I am.  Is it because I've got more body fat stored that I can ride without eating? Or some other conditioning thing? "
587,Fitness Under Extreme Time Constraints,"Context  Unfortunately, due to some recent (positive) life events, I now have very little time to perform physical exercise. We're talking, sub-three mins twice a day**. Under normal time constraints I would perform some sort of body weight sequence about 4-6 times a week for about 20-30 min each session, followed by 15 mins of indoor biking. And some sort of combination of dead lift, back squat, power clean, overhead squat, push-press, or bench-press 2-4 times per week.  Goals  Diminish lose of strength and work capacity, maintain health.  Current Routine  AM: 10 Handstand Push-ups, 10 Pull-ups  PM: 10 Chin-ups, 10 Hanging Leg Lifts (hang from bar, with stiff straight knees, hinge at waist, with stationary upper body, pulling legs from perpendicular to the floor to parallel with the floor). In addition, I will randomly get the opportunity to wear a 50 lb weighted vest and do air squats or perform thrusters with the vest and two 25 lb dumbells etc.  Question  Given the conditions, and the desired outcome, how should I modify what I am doing? Should I be doing something totally different?   Available Equipment  Stationary Bike Pull-up bar Dumbells: 25lb x2, 15lb x2 Kettle Bells: 35lb, 20lb Weighted Vest, adjustable up to 50lbs Stairs  Thanks!  **Oopse, what I should have said is that the current activities that I perform take about three minutes twice a day. I realize that there is in fact more than that available in my daily schedule, a little more than three times that I'd say. Also, I should have stated that this period has a known end date. It should be about four more weeks. "
588,What can I eat the night before to help me get up in the morning?,"What can I eat the night before I go to bed to help me get up in the morning?  My issue is not waking up, or being lazy, nor is it my body being sore. But there are times when my body will refuse to move in the morning and it will sometimes take me anywhere from 15 to 45 minutes before I can gather enough energy to push myself into a sitting position.  Once sitting I'm a bit better and once I get something into my stomach everything is fine.  From everything I'm reading, pretty much anything I eat before I go to bed will get used by as energy, to rebuild muscle or get stored as fat.  Currently, I'm taking a casein shake before going to bed which hasn't had any negative effect.  Anyone have a clue.  Should I just have a jar or raisins on the night stand as quick energy in the morning?  Update: Well, I do not know if this is fitness related or not, that's the issue. I do go to the gym three times a week and workout fairly intensely. I have also started counting calories in the last couple of weeks to stay within 1800 calories daily and adding more based on whatever activity I'm doing.  And have been slowly burning off fat, hopefully.  My caloric intake is 50/50 carbohydrate/protein (hovering at 200 grams each), fat will vary from 10 to 40 grams day to day.  But as I said I'm keeping caloric intake to around 1800 calories, so on days when I consume more fats, I'll usually intake less carbohydrates and protein.  At the gym I usually burn about 600 calories on weights alone and the scale seems to confirm that.    Hope that's enough information. "
589,Scheme 3-4 times fitness a week - Hypertrophy,"Note: my goal is hypertrophy  I have stopped for half a year working out. Now I lost practically all of my muscle I had built up before. I'm trying to get back into fitness, preferably 3-4 times a week. I wanted to start off good so I searched a bit on the internet and found a lot of different schemes to train muscle groups for 3x a week. F.e. a 2-split scheme and not being restrained by 7 days in a week, and that training 1 muscle group once a week wouldn't cut it. (source: bodybuildingforum url unknown)  Because of this inconsistency I was wondering, what theoretically (for a 19-year old male who just started training again), would be a correct scheme for training 3x a week and what would be a correct scheme for training 4x a week?  My current scheme is for 3x:  Monday:   Legs Shoulders   Wednesday:   Chest Biceps   Friday:   Back Triceps   Is this an optimized workout-plan or should I edit something? And what would be an optimized plan for 4x a week? "
590,Why big weight bench press makes me feel less sore?,"The following is one experiment I have done:  Bench press to exercise my chest.    Method One:  50KG, 8~10 reps, 10 sets. During the next two days, my chest muscle did not feel as painful and sore as I had anticipated. And it took very short time to fully recover.    Method Two:  20KG, 100 reps, 1 set.  During the next two days, I could feel that chest muscle was exploding, very sore. Every muscle was growing.     Why's that? Which should be considered more effective? "
591,What happened to the quality of the inner backside of running shoes?,"I'm an occasional runner (2-3 times/week, 10+ km each run). In 2007 I bought ASICS Gel Kayano 12 (TN600) to run with until 2013 (between 3000 and 4000 kilometers). They started to fall apart and I got new ones.  I again chose Gel Kayano, but the model number has increased to 19 (T300N). I had same comfort in running with them, but after around 1000km I recently noticed that the inner backside has exploded, on both shoes. Today, it rubbed my skin away around the Achilles tendon.  Not remembering this issue with my old Gel Kayano 12 (left) I compared the tissue: it is not the same quality (right Gel Kayano 19): (click for a larger version of the pictures)     I basically have two questions: What did I do wrong? Are there still running shoes with the kind of tissue my Kayano 12 had.  I hope this question is on-topic. Please help me to modify it, if it's not.  More detailed information can be found on my blog, but everything important is in here, in this question. "
592,Stronglifts 5x5: Start in deficit and move to surplus when reaching 5RM on lifts,"I have 2.5 years experience, have been cutting since January 1th, and I think I'm done cutting after April. This will be my longest and by far the best cut so far, I've counted calories with MFP, been active and trained with an ABA full body routine instead of the usual UL/UL routine.   I just changed my ABA full body to Stronglifts 5x5, mostly because I want to test out this official app from the authors team: [website]When I'm done cutting, I'll be at around 10-12% bf. This is where I'll start maintaining for at least a month before going over to a lean bulk during the summer and a bulk in the fall/winter. This has proven to work for me before.   My question is: Is it a wise tactic to start Stronglifts 5x5 at very low numbers (around 70% of my 5RM) in a caloric deficit, then when I reach my 5RM OR I reach 10% BF, I'll transit over to a maintenance or ~200-300 kcal over?  Focus while cutting will as always be form and explosiveness, with some body weight accessory lifts.   Some stats:   Lifting since November 2013, almost w/o skipping Height: 1.95 cm, Weight: 88 kg, Age: 21 y.o 1RM in KG (Squat/Bench/DL) Before bulking August - Desember: 125/85/145 @91.5kg After bulk in Desember: 135/100/160 @95.8kg Today, after cut since Desember: 120/90/150 @88kg  "
593,Which variables are used in modern training equipment in order to calculate training intensity/effectivity?,"There are lots of products in the market which targets individuals who want to be more aware/in control of their training. The most common and classic of such instruments are pulse sensors, either as watches or devices that are strapped on the chest (while running for instance). I stumbled upon two new devices which I think will take the concept one step further; Jawbone UP and Nike Fuel Band. Since I have no intentions of advertise for any product I'll leave it to the interested reader to get more information about them.   What I am wondering is what variables are used in these kind of products? Or rather what constitutes as a good measure of training effectivity/intensity?  The pulse and blood pressure are the obvious answers, and the majority of the newer stuff use 3D accelerometers for motion sensing. There are concerns about the accuracy of these sensors in training, however, due to the localization issue (i.e. if the device is on your arm, all training not involving your arm goes more or less unregistered) I have heard about the ""blood oxygenation"" (dunno even know if it's a proper word) to  be an interesting/important parameter, but it's supposedly not yet possible to measure it with non-invasive equipment. Can anyone confirm or deny this?  "
594,Is supplementation counter productive when your goal is getting a six pack/lean mass?,"I try hit the gym about 3-5 times a week (using a 3 day split program), and take something similar to Supplements SA Ganic-F Insane  as pre-workout, and I've got protein shake that i use as a snack replacement/additive to me cereal in the morning.  I've never been a big guy, but in the same breathnever had things like decent muscle shape and a 6 pack. It has been my goal to achieve this since last year this time. My initial idea was I need to gain some mass, otherwise there wont be anything to tone/build off of?  Basically my question is, in my case...  Is supplementation counter productive when your goal is getting a six pack/lean mass? "
595,Measuring progress in Bouldering,I have been climbing for 13 years now and have been competing for most of that. I have reached a plateau or at least a point where simply measuring progress with the grading system is not accurate enough. I am climbing in the V9/10 range now and am actively training on both system and campus boards. I log those workouts. My question is does anyone have any idea on ways to determine and quantify progress in this sport?  Update What I am currently thinking I may do to measure progress is to video myself while I do my training routine and climb then afterwards rate my smoothness and control on some sort of scale 1-10 for example and see how it changes from week to week. Does anybody have any better ideas or improvements?  
596,How do I cope with extreme pain from running on hard surfaces?,"For the last 1/2 of 2011 I was going to my gym and working out 5-6 times per week. It was amazing! I preferred running on the treadmill as it was predictable with less impact. I also was able to switch it up and hop on an elliptical to diversify.   However, I'm no longer able to afford a gym or treadmill, and I'm trying to stick with some ad-hoc routines at home and running outside. But when I run outside consistently, I have a lot of pain. Feet, ankles, calves, knees and hips. This never happened when running on the treadmill, so it seems to be due to the impact of running outside, on steep hills and on pavement. Once I stop running and stretch, the pain is gone as quick as 10 minutes after my run is complete. I am definitely stretching both before and after.  How can I cope? I'd love not to be able to be eating ibuprofen all day and I really want to continue running, it keeps me sane!  Ideas?  EDIT With More Information:  After reading some of these responses and thinking about it some more, I have some additional information that I think would be helpful. This run is the same every time and it includes some pretty steep hills down in the beginning. I can imagine that the impact of downhill running on steep hills just makes the impact much worse? This could set the stage for pain throughout my run if running on this hill downward and landing heavily.  My shoes are great, never had an issue before, but that was on a treadmill. I would bet that I am conditioned to run on a treadmill, but since that is not an option and there are very little other choices where I live, can I train my body to run better on hard surfaces?  I've always been intrigued by the Vibram Five-Finger shoes, but I've heard mixed results. I am sure it would take a while to train myself to run differently, as I don't run this way.  ONE LAST EDIT  I tried my runs recently by skipping the hill, which I know is very tough on my body. The effort it takes to just make sure I don't go rolling down the hill is one thing, let alone the impact of my weight + momentum all landing on my feet and move throughout my body.  The last few days while running the trail I tried to get on real ground when I can (1/3 of the time) as well as skipping the extremely steep hills - it was not any better or less painful.   EVERYONE had great feedback and worthwhile points, but I'm inclined to think that it's about getting used to it. I do think that I'll try learning to run with less impact as well.  "
597,heavy squats burn 9000 calories?,"I am doing 5x5 with current squat weight of 275 lbs (body wight 194lbs)  Just calculated how much energy it takes to move such weight over 4 feet (approximate distance for my 6ft height) from the ground against gravity  It seems that 25 squats require 9000 calories to perform. It can't be right, since I eat like 3000 calories a day. Is there mistake in my math?  Math on WolframAlpha  Math: 4 feet distance, 4100 joules per 1 kilocalorie "
598,Will doing a large amount of shoulder presses interspersed throughout the day improve strength?,"Using a kettlebell while sitting at my desk to do occasional shoulder presses over the course of a few hours, I wonder if there's any benefit or am I just risking injury?  What volume would I have to work with in order to see any positive benefit?  For simplicity's sake, let's say I am not doing any other kind of training.  The load is a 5 or 6 on the RPE scale. "
599,Home Workout: My body has been disfigured. How do I even the both sides?,"My left chest is smaller 50% than the right. My left back and butt are 30% bigger than the right.  I am right handed so this might have happened. It wasn't so noticeable before but after I started working out at home recently, it's starting to look uneven.  The problem worsened when I started doing push-ups focusing on the left one in order to balance both the chests. Now the chest looks barely even and the left back is growing while the right isn't.  How do I even them out? Any specific technique to workout at home? "
600,Getting back into working out after year hiatus,"This time last year, I was in some of my best shape .. however over the past year it's gone the complete other way. I haven't gained much weight (says the lying scale, I assume) however I have definitely lost most of the muscle tone and increased the midsection (as expected).   What would be suggested to be the best transition back into the routines?  Prior to stopping, I was going 4-5 times a week, for an hour to an hour and a half, doing general workouts as;   Always starting with 10 minutes of warmup cardio Then the lifting being either;   Back/Biceps Chest/Triceps Shoulders/Legs  Usually ending with a solid 20 minutes of good cardio to finish the work out   This worked very well for me and if I did keep up, I think I'd be one happy guy. The lull came and I am looking to get back to it.   Would it be wise to do a more limited workout, or just say.. lower weight sets?  And slowly work my way back?    Basic Info:   Age: 32 Weight: 175lbs Sex: Male No real injury concerns  "
601,taking creatine in line with take a diureic,"I was wondering, since it seemed counterproductive to me, does it make sense to take creatine while also taking a diuretic?  If creatine creates an increase in size through storing more water weight overall shouldn't it for the most part need to retain that water, and it is also highly recommended to drink a lot of water while taking creatine to stop your body from developing, I think kidney problems?.   The essence of the question is, is it counterproductive to take a diuretic, in the form of Animal Cuts, while taking creatine? Would it decrease the effects of the creatine? "
602,Is the Tabata exercise method more effective than other forms of exercise?,"I came across this article while searching for workout tips, with the main claim being:     This training method is so simple, yet so incredibly difficult, that athletes tend to try it once, acknowledge its greatness, and then vow to never speak its name again. What is it? It's simple: take one exercise and perform it in the following manner:      1) For twenty seconds, do as many repetitions as possible.      2) Rest for ten seconds      3) Repeat seven more times!      That's it! You're done in four minutes! Oh, and that thing you're trying to brush off your face? That would be the floor.   When I looked for the original claims, I found this paper by Tabata et al, with the abstract claiming:     ...this study showed that moderate-intensity aerobic training that improves the maximal aerobic power does not change anaerobic capacity and that adequate high-intensity intermittent training may improve both anaerobic and aerobic energy supplying systems significantly, probably through imposing intensive stimuli on both systems.   However, the number of subjects for the study were 7.  A later study published in 1997 by the same group showed the 20s/10s protocol was effective, but now with N=9:     IE1 consisted of one set of 6-7 bouts of 20-s exercise at an intensity of approximately 170% of the subject's maximal oxygen uptake (˙VO2max) with a 10-s rest between each bout. ... this study showed that intermittent exercise defined by the IE1 protocol may tax both the anaerobic and aerobic energy releasing systems almost maximally.   Is this a generally effective exercising technique?  Have there been studies where N is at least greater than 10 showing it?   "
603,Felt dizziness half an hour after running for 7 minutes,"I exercise occasionally once in 4-5 days for half an hour. Today I ran for 5 minutes on the treadmill inside a room not too well ventilated. Afterwards I walked at brisk pace for about 500 meters. 10 minutes that  I was having breafast, while in course of breakfast I felt dizzines so much so that I stopped taking breakfast came out of the restaurant and sat in the open under a tree shade. After breathing for a while it felt Okay and I walked back home. Is this a symptom for something grave? What I should I do to ovrcome this at least its recurrence? "

606,Eating Saturated Fat along with Carbs in LCHF Diet,"I was doing keto diet for 3 months and I had to quite because of the keto rash. I wanna do Low-Carb-High-Fat (LCHF) with 100-120 grams of carbs, something like (60,30,30) for (fat,protein,crabs) but my concern is how to eat those carbs? I mean, based on my understanding, eating carbs will raise insulin spikes, so the odds to store the (saturated) fat is increased. Should I separate the fat from carbs meals? For example, I eat two meals per day, is it healthy to do a ""fat"" meal and a ""carb"" meal?   I found that some of the Paelo diet people do the same portions, however, I don't attend to follow the Paelo diet such as not eating cheese, etc. Is this healthy from LCHF perspective? I don't want to harm myself by eating more (saturated) fat and not being in ketosis.  Can I lose weight if my macros are deficient using this diet?  "
607,Why do elite cyclists seem to have higher VO2 max tham elite marathon runners?,"For example, Chris Froome's VO2 max was 84.6. Some were at least 90! [website]While marathon runners seem to fall between 70 to 75. [website]Both the cyclists and runners seem to also have similar heart rates during races. Articles about running say that 5 and 10k benefit more from a higher VO2 max but grand tours are much longer than marathons in terms of exercise duration. For the Tour de France, it's 3500km and they cycled long distance for all day for a few weeks!  [website]Chris Froome averaged 158 BPM. [website]Average for marathons is 160 BPM. [website]Power analysis from a marathon. The average power was 306.2W. [website]Bradley Wiggins had a power of 456W for 55 minutes. If you multiply that by 75% to get the endurance power zone, you get 342W which is higher than the marathon runner's. [website]Does it have something to do with coasting, higher muscle mass, smoother pedalling versus short ground contact times in running, better cooling, better hydration, more refuelling, better gear ratios, less upper body utilization, or less muscle damage?  Other examples of athletes with high VO2 max include cross-country skiers and rowers. "
608,Arms too long to snatch properly,"A friend of mine has arms that are so long that when he stands with his hands at the collars, the barbell hangs well below his hip crease.  He doesn't know what to do at the explode/second pull.  If he does what comes naturally (gets to a power position and explodes) he makes contact with his genitals often enough that he naturally isn't willing to do that anymore.    Should he explode early?  Then the barbell is brushing/making contact at his thighs, more like the rest of us when we clean.  There's a lot written about this isn't optimal, but perhaps this is a case of you-do-what-you-gotta-do.  Should he bend his arms during the first pull?  This is a recreational athlete, so I do not feel comfortable trying to teach him about arm bend.  He'd have to practice a LOT to learn to relax his arms at the explode, and I don't believe he'll invest that kind of time.  Are there other options that I'm not seeing?  Note:  My question is similar to this question except my athlete cannot possibly widen his grip any more. "
609,Ways to reduce rest time between lifting sets?,"I'm currently training 3x a week for mainly strength and progressing fine, but I find that my rest times between sets are ridiculously long and if I don't take them, I'm not able to finish my sets.For example, on my heavy 3x5 squats, I need to rest for 5-7 minutes.   This is pretty bad, but what's worse is that even my assistance work (chinups, dips) need this much rest, or else the number of reps I can do goes down.  So what's the best way to improve my endurance and need less rest time? I heard cardio might help? "
610,How can i burn fat without losing weight?,"I am 21 years old 1.75m and like 64.5kg. and started doing kickboxing 3 days a week for 4 months now. Kickboxing contains endurance and strength training nearly for the whole body. I didn't do anything for a long time before that, except for playing football(soccer) for a half year (during the 4 years where I didn't do anything except that...) Since I started kickboxing I noticed a big change in my body. My shoulders are getting wider and my arms don't look that weak anymore.   But I still have one Problem. I have a fat around my belly it isn't extremely much. But it sucks. I want to get an ABS until August, so I can show off my body without getting uncertain and losing confidence about my body.  One and a half weeks ago, I started doing situps daily. 40 Situps, then 20 pushups and after that 40 situps again. But is this really usefull for burning fat there? Or what can I do for burning fat? I thought of going jogging on the days I dont do kickboxing, but I don't want to lose weight, just burn fat. How can I achieve that?  EDIT: I don't know if it's important but the workout schedule looks like this:  Monday: Kickboxing  Tuesday: Situps-Pushups (I want to add jogging)  Wendsday: Kickboxing  Thursday: Situps-Pushups (I want to add jogging)  Friday: Kickboxing  Saturday: Situp-Pushups (not every saturday, only when i am motivated :P )  Sunday same as Saturday except I want to add jogging.

611,Improvements to Curved Back while sitting on Heels and trying to get Back aligned with floor?,"You sit on top of heels. You try to get back to the floor straight while bending backwards. A picture is here. The ideal position has the lumbar spine almost touching the floor, specifically the vertebrae such as L4-T7 closer to ground. Anatomically, this is related to muscle chains connecting psoas, hip flexors, back muscles and tight hamstrings.  How can you improve the sitting on heels position with backwards bend?        What is the name of this position? Its yoga name? Its fitness term?   How to improve the position?    Is the anatomic analysis correct about hip flexors, psoas, back and hamstrings? How to find more specific muscles?     "
612,Exercise with pulmonary stenosis,"I have mild congenital pulmonary stenosis, which Wikipedia defines as:     outflow of blood from the right ventricle of the heart is obstructed   at the level of the pulmonic valve. This results in the reduction of   flow of blood to the lungs.   It doesn't affect me at all in my daily life. Recently I thought I should start regular exercises, so I try to jog from time to time. What I want to ask are:   How to tell if I am just using that as an excuse or am I really at my limit? My jogging habits are always run a little, walk a little, run a little, walk a little. I guess I switch when I am slightly out of breath.   I understand these are more medical related, but none of the doctors I have visited can tell me anything in depth.   Is there a particular type of exercises that are good for people like me? Would weight training be related to this at all?  "
613,How to gain weight for a naturally thin person?,"I am a guy who haven't been working out(exercising) throughout my life. I live a very sedentary live, mostly at my desk reading books or using my computer. The nature of my field of work requires me to only sit at my desk. As opposed to what many people would think of me, I am not obese but neither am I fit. I am very thin and look somewhat scrawny. I am thinking that this is perhaps too unhealthy for a life. I've read a few of the answers on this site and it seems that most of the answers are suited for people who haven't worked out for years and have started to gather fats and would want to burn it. For me, I am too skinny for any visible fats.  I'm thinking how I should begin to start gaining weight and look less skinny, albeit in a correct and healthy manner; I reckon that an abrupt and incorrect way of starting out this goal will end up more harmful than helpful. So, I'm seeking for some advice on this.  I'm a 26 year old male and weigh 45kg. I feel like I'm very thing. What is a good way to improve my health? Is it a good idea to use power plank exercise machines for someone like myself? "

615,Why did I not gain weight when having 4000 calories a day?,"I'm about 6ft high and weigh 175 pound, age 26.  For the last few years, I have lived a fairly sedentary lifestyle, easily consuming about 4000 calories per day.   What I would like to know is why if I don't burn off more calories then I take in, I don't seem to gain weight? The only time in my life I gained weight was a period where after moving to a new place I ate a lot of deep fried food for a few months.  According to various online calculators I need about ~2000 calories for my body just to function.  Should the additional 2000 calories I have been taking in contribute to weight gain? Why do they not seem to? Estimates say on my diet I should weigh over 200lbs, yet I weigh 175.  I calculated my daily calory intake based on the myfitnesspal.com website    Why would I not be gaining weight in the typical manner, especially with less exercise or physical activity than is typical? "
616,Will eating only protein cause me to lose weight faster without muscle spoiling?,"I've been on a ketogenic diet for the past two months, while also doing weightlifting three times a week. I need 2900 kcal a day to maintain my weight, but I've been eating at a 20% deficit to lose weight - 25g carbs, 160g protein and 175g fat daily.  But the fact that I'm in ketosis means I'm already burning mostly fat - why not burn my body's fat instead of sticks of butter?  As I understand it, all that really matters in preventing muscle wasting is that you get enough protein and exercise. So can I spend a couple days eating only 160g protein, and expect at the end to have around 250g less fat in me (i.e., the fat I didn't eat, that thus had to come from my body's stores) for every day mostly-fasting? And would that happen without losing significant muscle mass? "
617,Breathing out during swimming freestyle,"When breathing out during swimming, I've come across conflicting info - a swim instructor years ago told me to ""exhale it all out immediately"", so after I take in my breath, once my head is submerged, I breath out fully.   I prefer, and the youtube videos I just watched support this, exhaling over time. So I'll breath in, and then once my head is submerged I'll breath out for the duration, until I turn my head to take another breath.  Is one way ""better"" or more efficient than the other? Is there debate between the two methods? Is one way ""just wrong""?  Note linked question doesn't  deal with breathing out, this is a different question. "
618,"Caffeine, weight loss, muscle gain & stretch marks","I am searching for information regarding the effects of caffeine and found this website for the first time.  For the last 3 weeks I´ve been trying to decrease my caffeine consumption, after having heard from a friend that it interferes with weight loss. The fact is that, though I´m not overweight (I´m 170cm = 5'7' and 62 Kg = 138 Lb. ?) I am trying to get rid of some fat pockets by working out more regularly. That seemed to be working without cutting my caffeine consumption, which by the end of last year reached about 5 cups a day. But I noticed some stretch marks appearing in the lower back, and little muscle gain. I haven´t been very successful on cutting on regular coffee, so I´m almost fully replacing it with green tea (which in the end also contains caffeine) and decaf coffee, drinking only one or two cups of coffee per day now preferably in the afternoons. I still get some headaches when not getting coffee in the morning, but it´s gotten much better; sometimes I just feel the need of drinking something hot.  My questions are:    Can caffeine hinder weight loss and muscle gain? Does the fact that caffeine increases the production of cortisol increase the likehood that people develop stretch marks when losing weight?   My weight loss hasn´t been radical, at least not during the last few months, it could have also been that I did not notice the strecht marks last time I lost a few pounds. I try to eat healthy, do intervals for cardio. "
619,Putting raw rolled oats in a protein shake?,"If I put raw rolled oats in my morning protein shake (I was just thinking: oats, milk and a scoop) for my breakfast meal, would they just pass though my body without being absorbed?

620,What might happen if I get very low blood sugar during a run and continue running?,"During a recent run, due to low blood sugar, I developed double vision. Otherwise, I felt great. Out of prudence, I quit and decided to walk home. I had eaten nothing for 14 hours before the run, so I am sure the problem was low blood sugar.  The double vision started half way through a 6-mile run. Had I continued on with the annoying double vision, what might have realistically happened? I am in seriously good shape, so what realistically might have happened? What would have been the next symptoms?  "
621,"When fat is burnt, where is it taken from?","I'm just curious if there is a general pattern of where fat is taken when it is spent during exercise. Is it taken more or less equally from all fat in the body, are some areas used more than others, is one area ""depleted"" before moving to the next?  Also, is it consistent with where fat is built up when stored? So if I gain x amount of fat and then burn x amount of fat, will my body ""look the same""?  (I know it is probably a lot more complicated, but just looking for some general surface lines of what's going on out of curiosity) "
622,Glucagon Supplementation for weight loss,"I'm currently on the Dukan diet, so protein-only for the next week then protein and salad only.  The basis of Dukan, like atkins, is to push your body into a state of Ketosis where it starts to burn fat for energy rather than sugar.  This process can only begin when the Glycogen reserves in the liver have depleted.  Can I supplement with Glucagon to accelerate this process?  Are there any risks associated with this?  NB I am not diabetic. "

624,Are there different muscular adaptations between barbell and dumbbell use?,"Most exercises can be performed with similar weight and form using either a barbell or a pair of dumbells. I have heard that as people begin to lift heavier weights it becomes more difficult to increase the weight of dumbbells when compared to barbells.  Similarly, my gym's dumbells only go as high as 30kg, and I've noticed that while I can barbell bench press 60kg for 5 reps quite easily, I can't do the same when trying to press a 30kg dumbbell in each hand (even with help getting the dumbbells into position).   Why is it more difficult to perform a lift with dumbbells than it is with with an equivilent weighted barbell? Is it because different muscles get used when being using dumbbells, even though its the same basic movement? If there are differences, are there any advantages to barbells over dumbbells or vice versa?  "
625,Incline Row Machine vs BB Pendlay Rows,"I'm doing SL5x5 and, for my without tonight, I swapped the normal Pendlay rows with the incline row machine. I was quite shocked at the weight difference. Normally, I'd be rowing around 115 but with the machine I could only manage about 70 (for the same sets/reps). But I wasn't just arbitrarily playing with the program, I decided to try the machine because I felt I had been cheating on the bb rows by using my lower back and glutes. To try to determine if I had been cheating, I wanted to see how my bb row compared to a roughly equivalent isolation exercise. My logic being that the machine should use every muscle that should be used in bb rows and limit me to only those. Therefore, if I wasn't cheating and all the same muscles are used, then the weight should be about the same. Such a large difference between my bb row and machine row would seem to indicate that one of the following is true:   The machine row isn't as similar to the bb row as I thought. Specifically, the incline row leaves out muscles used in the bb row. I've been cheating on my bb rows.   So is it 1 or 2? And if it's 1, what is left out?  An incline row machine similar to what I'm using and referring to:   "

627,How can I measure my physical progress if I am gaining muscle faster than I am losing fat?,"I've been trying to build muscle/burn fat/generally get in shape for the past two months, but I have not been noticing much difference in my appearance. I don't expect to have lost 10lbs, but I can at least tell I'm making a bit of progress because I can lift a little more or run a little longer.   I don't bother weighing myself since I figure that, since I'm both trying to burn fat and build muscle, my weight may not be an accurate representation of progress. Some people might try measuring their waist and keeping track of that, but most of my excess fat does not actually sit on my waist.   Are there any other methods I can use to try to keep track of my physical progress?  Update:   Some new context is that I've realized that my insulin resistance can affect my ability to burn fat. So, I may be building muscle, but not losing much fat, making it hard to see progress. With this in mind, what can I do? "
628,How can I adjust my fitness routine to account for my insulin resistance?,"For the past few months I have been trying to lose fat/build muscle/generally become more fit, but have not been seeing any progress. After a bit of googling, I found that insulin resistance, which I was diagnosed with years ago, can hinder attempts to lose fat. Are there methods I can use to try to account for this difficulty?   I already try to avoid carbs when I can - and when I do eat them I opt for whole grain - but are there things I can eat/exercises I can do that will make my attempts more fruitful?  In case it helps, my usual work out routine is minimum 2x week 30min weight training w/ 10 min cardio warm-up, + 30 minute elliptical as many times as I can fit into my schedule, and my average caloric intake is about 1500 mostly from meat, veggies + fruits. 22yo female 5'4 ~140-145lbs "
629,What's proper head/torso motion for overhead barbell press?,"I'm ready to learn the overhead barbell press, but am very confused about the head, neck, and torso motion. When do you tilt in, when do you tilt out?  Can someone clarify this? The arms are clear but not the neck, head, or torso.  UPDATE: What's confusing me? Some sources talk about moving your head out of the way, and then bringing it back again once the bar passes.  That's simple enough: move the bar up as far as you can till your head blocks it, move your head back, and, once the bar passes it, return your head.  But SS describes something totally different: not that your head is in the way, but simply you need to get the bar overhead, so you move your torso? This is confusing: If I push the bar straight up, and so never come into the path of my head, what exactly am I doing with my torso? I'm supposed to lean forward, to place my head under the bar? I'm not sure I'm understanding that correctly, but, if I am, that's a confusing thing to do.  Why do I need to stick my head out under the bar.  Unless something else is meant. "

631,How does superhuman strength work?,"I totally know this is not the best question for here because it goes beyond just fitness-y stuff and into all of that science stuff more so, but let's consider I am asking this is a good-hearted, simple way:  Middle-aged woman; doesn't exercise really; has three kids; probably couldn't lift even 200 lbs. on the deadlift on any normal day, even with full force.  One day, her child is trapped under the back, rear-bumper of a small car, and she somehow lifts it enough to save the baby. Even disregarding the fact that the car is small, most U.S. cars that are small still weigh over 1,800 lbs. most of the time.  With that in mind, it would most certainly take over 200 lbs. of force to lift one rear-side of a bumper. Why can she do this?  Why can some people gain this superhuman strength, and what can simply explain it for one like me who is interested in the power world more?   Also, if this superhuman strength can just appear and help a person lift something they couldn't normally lift, couldn't this superhuman strength be trained to be applied to more common use, possibly? "
632,3 day split workout + running between workout days?,"I recently started going to the gym again after a year of little to no sports except  long runs and walks and virtually no upper body exercises except a year of PT (popped my shoulder in a bad accident).  Before the accident I could   bench around 140 lbs, now I can hardly do 40 lbs. do around 30 consecutive pullups - now I can't even do one. ...   Long story short:   My main goal is to regain some of my strength and be able to bench a a reasonable weight again (say 100 lbs) by August, as well as being able to do at least a few (maybe 10?) pull-ups.  I'm started doing a 3 day split to build strength and mass :   Mo: Chest + Biceps Tu: off We: Back + Triceps Th: off Fr: Legs + Shoulders Sa: off So: off  Would I burn too many calories by running on 2 off-days to my routine? Will running affect my primary goal of regaining muscle?   I'm already eating a lot of high protein, calorie dense foods and loads of vegetables and fruits, would eating even more help me power through the 3 day split AND the running? "
633,Why does the body burn muscles instead of fat in a calorie deficit body?,"Assumption    There have been many articles and answers (even on this site) that exercising while on a calorie-deficit diet (or weightlifting/exercising for more than an hour) will not result in bigger muscles as the body will begin to burn the muscles for energy after a certain point.    Questions    Is this valid for all bodies? Meaning that will this happen regardless of whether your body fat percentage is 20% or 10%?  Why (Only applicable if the assumption is valid for all bodies)? I understand the rationale if the body fat percentage is less than a certain level; however, for a body with lots of body fat, the body already has enough fat storage for the body to use. Why would it use the muscles for energy?     Thanks.  "
634,arm muscle size not increasing,"A few months ago, my triceps starting showing. I've been regularly going to gym and my diet consist of protein, carbs and veggies (broccoli) and follow ""Rule of third"" 1/3 of protein, 1/3 of carbs and 1/3 of veggies.   The problem is that I don't see any changes in triceps and biceps change. Even my chest lines come and goes, so does my obliques lines (side lines).   The tummy is also being stubborn. I don't put on a lot of weight when doing dumbbells as I don't find any helper and it could fall on me.  So what am I doing wrong? Why isn't my size changing, why triceps and bicep size not changing? Chest line come and go? How do I change my routine, making things change and see the result after weeks?  I do 40 minutes cardio everyday.  "
635,Hamstrings and running intervals,"I've started doing some running intervals/speedwork and notice that my hamstrings get pretty sore afterwards.  I do some off-day stretching, although I probably could do more.  Should I push ahead and deal with soreness, focus more on stretching or should I so some hamstring strengthening exercises?  What would be a good regimen? "
636,Heavy weight vs Light weight?,My goal is to build muscle size. There is lot of information online which says like Arnold says(3rd point) you need to lift heavy to increase muscle size and there's other information as well like on this Flex website you need to lift light to increase your muscle size. What should I do? Lift heavy or lift light to increase my muscle size? 
637,Critique my SL + Greyskull hybrid,"I really like Strong Lifts, but it isn't working well for me anymore. Too many resets and not making it past previous resets. Admittedly, my lack of progress is likely attributable more to my lack of proper nutrition and sleep than to a fault in the program. I've been told that Greyskull is a good intermediate program, so I reason that it requires less recovery than novice programs like SL. But I do wonder whether it is possible for someone who is still a novice to make progress on an intermediate program. Is the following enough stimulus to cause significant adaptation?  The reason for making a hybrid is that I like BB rows, but they are not feasible in GS. I would just include them as an add-on to bench days but, on days with bench, row and deadlift, my deadlift would suffer from fatigue from the rows.  A day:   Bench 2x5, 1x5+ Row 2x5, 1x5+ Squat 2x5, 1x5+   B day:   OHP 2x5, 1x5+ Some kind of curl in a 3x8 More? DL 1x5+   Note: the 1x5+ set is an AMRAP set, with a minimum of 5 to be considered successful.  And these would be alternated on MWF, like SL. As in, one week, A on Monday, B on Wednesday, and A on Friday; then the opposite next week.  And I'll be using GS weight increments. That's 5 lb increases on Squat and DL and 2.5 lb on everything else. Weight is increased any time at least 5 reps are completed in every set.  About me: I weight around 200 lb at 5'8"" and my current squat 1RM is 225 lb and bench is 165 lb. My goal is primarily strength. "
638,Why does my waist hurt during pullups?,"I have started doing pullups again(after a year or 2), past 2 years I had been doing other sports such as dancing, running, pushups so I am kindof in shape.  But my waist(as can be seen from the picute: external oblique) hurt when I do pullups, expecially when before I come down and straighten my arms.  It also hurts when I stretch that part, the rest of the time I am totally find, I dont feel a thing.  What should I do? Should I take a break from pullups? Should I go see a doctor? "
639,Don't feel anything with Pendlay barbell rows. Should I switch to Yates rows?,"I started the 5x5 SL program 2-3 months ago, and have had doubts about the quality of my barbell rows. I do them like Mehdi suggests: [website]Though I hear that it can be difficult to really feel it when you start out, I don't feel it in my back, but in my glutes, hams, and my quads, which I think is strange.  I tried doing Yates rows and felt it significantly more in my back.  Why would that be?  If I feel it more with Yates, should I do those instead, or is something still happening with the Pendlay rows even though I can't feel it? "
640,Why do I have a deadlift deficiency?,"For a relatively long time now I have been doing Bill Star 5x5 type routine.  Weight ~85kg with max bench 130kg, squat 160kgx5 but deadlift is low, I sometimes got sharp pain in my lower back when going to anything heavier than 100kg or 120kg. Recently, I have slightly widened my stance and my hands go inside (like sumo) and the pain is no longer there and it seems easier for me to keep my back straight.   I get the impression that it should be at least as high as the squat from what I see most others doing.  My grip also loosens very easily and my forearms are relatively weak. At the moment I drop 140kg. I am trying to work out whether I can overcome this or if I have an injury which makes it hurt when I deadlift. What is a good method for increasing grip strength if that is the problem? Or could it just be that my lifts are not in a coventional proportion? "
641,"Rubber residue on weights stains clothing, carpets, hands","I bought a set of CAP dumbbells from Costco. The black rubber leaves residue on my hands, my clothing, and my carpet. Soap and water removed it from my hands. 'Resolve' carpet powder removed most (not all) of the residue from my carpet. I haven't washed my clothing yet.  I called the Cap company. They claim to have never heard of a residue problem and so had no advice.  Is the residue problem I'm experiencing a true anomaly or has anyone else experienced the same (with Cap or any other brand)? Did you find a workaround, or did you give up and just lived with it?  Note: If this is a no-win situation, then I'll waste no time in returning the set to Costco.  P.S. The weights also have that stinky rubber smell mentioned in another post. I'm trying the vinegar soak right now. Washing and air-drying were futile. "
642,Should I grind or should I fail?,"I have noticed that I grind out the last 1 to 2 reps of my back squat for the last 2 to 3 sets.  Sometimes this involves doing something funky with my hips or knees, which I don't like, but I have the urge to do what it takes to finish the rep.  I know that technique is critical, so should I resist this urge and instead fail the rep? Or should I push myself and finish it?  If it makes a difference, I'm doing the SL 5x5 program. "
643,Do Electric Muscle Stimulators really work for losing weight?,"For whom doesn't know, EMS definition:      Electrical Muscle Stimulation, also known as neuromuscular electrical   stimulation (NMES) or electromyostimulation, is the elicitation of   muscle contraction using electric impulses.   Recently I bought one belly EMS belt(like this one) that works very well(it really contracts my abdomen muscles with shocks).   My main objective is to lose weight and reduce my waist circumference. On internet refferences it is kind of obscure(some people says it works and some don't). So, does anyone have a experience about it? Does this EMS's equipments really works for what it intended to? "
644,Best swim crawl to enlarge the shoulders,"What is the best crawl that helps to broaden your shoulders?  Is is possible to tell that theres a crawl, according to the specific movements, better than the others for this aim? "
645,Training running speed going faster at 95-98% or longer at 80%,"TL;DR.: For speed training, is it better to run longer at 80% of the max HR, or faster at 95% of the max HR?  Long rant:  I'm able to run 6Km in 50min if I control my speed based on the HR, by not allowing it to got past 80-85% of the HR limit for my age. I'm also able to run 5Km in 35 minutes, if I allow te HR to go up to 92%...  ... which sucks (time-wise).    Today I peaked at 185bpm after 19minutes running at 9.5Km/h. I ""assume"" my max HR is 187bpm, although I happened to be having a conversation for 2 minutes while fluctuating around 183bpms (oddly enough, I wasn't grasping for air).     So, the question comes down to: Is it better to keep pushing the ""distance"" at 80% of my calculated max heart-rate, or should I also bet on speed by once in a while push it to 95-98% and keep it there for a few minutes?    Some background: I'm 34. My couch to 5k was done about 9 months ago. Although I trained martial arts from 17 to 27, I did become overweight and pretty sedentary during my PhD and postdoc (last 7yrs). I assume that 7yrs of no training completely reversed the heavy training I did in my youth ;-) "
646,Do joints wear out from exercise?,"Does regular movement keep joints lubricated, or does regular movement dry out joints in time leading to wear?   After a good 20 years of jogging on and off, I've stopped that now because I could start to feel shin splints and hip pain and I'm all too aware that my father and his brother have both had hip replacements.  I now walk anywhere from 8-15 miles daily, albeit slowly. No problems with hips or shins, but I just wonder if the body wears out like a machine? "
647,Can a two weeks pause have a positive impact on strength training?,"I am 42 yr old and have been doing a simple bodyweight squat/push/pull routine every third day for a few months. Then I had not any time for exercising any more during 13 days. Today I came back to the gym, fearing I might have lose the little progress I had achieved.  To my surprise, my body is stronger, and I found myself repeating almost effortlessly the exercise variations and number of reps of my last workout 14 days ago. I then realized in the mirror that my triceps and shoulders are slightly more noticeable.  Well, what is the lesson one can learn here? Perhaps:   It is good to introduce one or two rest weeks rest every, say, two months? Should I workout less often from now on, by introducing 3 rest days between consecutive workouts instead of 2? What I did in those 13 days have kept me in shape? (a lot of playing with my 4 yr old daughter, including lifting her up in my arms, running and jumping all the time)   Any explanation or reference about systematic rest periods introduced in a strength program would be interesting.  (Remark, the day after: Ouch, feeling DOMS everywhere... If a fly landed on my pecs now, I could cry) "
648,Training on small/medium hills for a trail race with large hills,"I live in an area with small hills. How do I make the most of these hills when training for a trail race with much larger hills?  One of my favorite races is a 15-mile trail race with 3000+ ft (900+ m) total elevation climb. There are three big uphill segments, 1–3mi (1–5km) long, 500–800 ft (130–230m) climb with grades of 7–10+%.  I'd like to improve my hill training in preparation for this year's race. The best two options I have in my area are:   Multiple hills with comparable or steeper grade, but much shorter: maybe 200 ft climb max. I can repeat these hills in quick succession. This trail is just a few minutes from my home and I can visit it several times a week One large hill, 500 ft, but it is much steeper (15% grade) and more technical, it's a good challenge uphill but seems difficult to run back down it in a safe matter. I spend a lot of time walking on this hill. I can only make it to this trail occasionally   Are repeated climbs on a small hill comparable to a single climb up a larger hill, in terms of training for miles-long climbs in the race? "
649,Typical screw and screw anchor for sling trainer?,"I happen to have a a screw with an eye sticking idly in my living room ceiling, and I'm thinking about using it to hang a rope for bodyweight rows etc. The screw is 8mmx50mm (thread x length of anchor). The TRX ceiling anchor seems to use 2 screws with 10 mm thread, so I'm a bit concerned about using my screw as is. On the other hand, the TRX product may be vastly overengineered and I have hung my 100kg from my screw a few times.  Now my question: Is the setup described above (2 screws, 10mm thread) typical for sling trainers? Are there experiences with using something closer to my thread size, one screw, in a concrete ceiling without the whole thing crashing down?  Note for imperialists, I mean folks unused to metric units: 8mm is 0.314 inch,  the closest thread size in imperial units is probably 1/4 inch. "
650,Is my meal & workout plan suitable for losing fat and gaining muscles?,"The below list is not exactly how I usually eat but approximately correct. Furthermore, I've used calories calculator to check their calories just to help you give me better recommendation. In addition, I've included my body detail below.    It is how I ate today, and I generally eat like this everyday. Breakfast Chicken breast, 2 big pieces: 300 Brown Rice, 1 cup : 220 some vegies: 20  Lunch Low Fat Greek Yogurt: 80 Chicken breast, 2 big pieces: 300 Instant Noodles, 1/2 package: 200  Dinner Brown Rice: 220 Garden Vegie Soup: 80  Snacks: Whey protein, 1 scoop: 100kcal Mandarine, large: 80 kcal  conclusion cals: 1500 +- 100 protein: 188g carb: not sure.

I want to lose weight (also gain muscles) but it seems like I'm gaining weight and I'm not sure whether I am gaining muscles or not. By the way, it's been only a week since I have started eating this way and working out. Are there any manipulation done in my meal or workout plan? Do I need to eat more calories than this? "
651,Measuring body fat with uneven upper/lower body proportions,"I am planning to start regular workouts in the gym and want to monitor my progress. Measuring body fat seems like a good starting point and I've already read about various methods to achieve that. I was wondering whether there is a point in measuring whole body fat when you have disproportionate body?   My case: I am a female with quite thin yet muscular upper body - narrow arms, protruding collar bone, strong back and flat belly. The lower body is also muscular but with a proper layer of fat especially around hips and thighs. By visual inspection the two parts clearly have different fat percentage (even when considering the fact that females should have some fat around hips). Is there a way to estimate body fat only for lower or upper body? Or maybe the whole body measure is sufficient? I am mainly interested in working on my lower body to achieve some balance and to monitor my progress I don't want to rely only on a mirror as the perception of my own body may change and I can get very critical at times. "
652,Will any lubricant work on any treadmill?,"I bought the LifeSpan TR1200-DT5 Treadmill Desk.  The manual says to use only 100% silicone lubricant.  Their product is overpriced, so I Googled ""100% silicone treadmill lubricant"" to look for other products.  What do I see in almost every return result?  LifeSpan.  Now it seems like a marketing ploy to advise only to use 100% silicone.  Since  hardly any other treadmill explicitly requires that, anyone looking for 100% silicone lubricant will inevitably come across LifeSpan's product.  It seems to me that lube for one treadmill will work with another, but could I be wrong? "
653,Dizzines with Insanity workout at the second month,"I started insanity workout and finished the sixth week and stopped for some reasons. A month later I decided to start again and did the fit test, which was really painful with a state of mind of reaching the same level as my last fit test before I stopped. I eventually could reach the same level. Then I continued the insanity workout starting directly at the sixth week. I couldn't do it continuously and had to stop at many points because of strong dizziness. Skipping some 45 seconds cycles I was able to finish it. My question is if those dizziness periods are dangerous and what are the causes behind them? lack of oxygen? fatigue? or just a heart that is not powerful enough to keep up with the pace? "
654,What kind of exercises should I do to develop more endurance for sally up pushup challenge?,"From time to time I like to do the ""Bring Sally Up"" pushup challenge. I usually put this video on, so that I can track how much I last.   I am able to do sets of 30-60 pushups, depending on the day, but I find that I'm not able to last more than about 2:40 of this challenge.  What kind of exercises should I do, in order to be able to improve my time? "
655,Developing both muscle fibres for endurance and explosiveness,"I'm an avid runner but I also train BJJ and so I want to have good endurance and some explosive power without being bulky. Recently, my strength training has just consisted of bodyweight exercises (pull-ups, push-ups, planches etc.). I'm intending on also getting a 20kg kettlebell soon as well.  As I understand it, slow twitch muscle fibers are the ones working when I'm doing an exercise that requires endurance and fast twitch muscle fibers are the ones working when I'm doing an exercise that requires explosive power.   When I'm doing push-ups (or pull-ups), are they working my slow-twitch or fast-twitch? If they use slow-twitch, I'm guessing plyometric/explosive/clap push-ups stimulate fast-twitch so should I do both to get power and endurance?  Or does it depend on the rep range? Because for example, if I can do 20 explosive push-ups, will I no longer be able to develop my fast-twitch muscle fibres because the rep range is too high? Also, I read that slow twitch muscles fibers aren't able to grow as much as fast-twitch muscles. When you gain endurance, do the slow twitch just get more efficient? Whereas fast twitch get better by getting bigger?  "
656,Best diet for lots of cycling and 3 kettlebell workouts a week?,"I cycle 140 miles a week and do a high, medium and light intensity kettlebell workout.  It seems to me like I need a high carb and high (ish) protein diet to sustain this. Currently I eat anything but find I'm always very hungry. Can anyone recommend a good diet to support this kind of lifestyle? I'm not looking to bulk up or anything like that but I would like my body to be in the best shape possible. Links / books / suggestions - anything would be great as a starting point. Perhaps there's some way I can calculate what I need? "
657,Will a brief break from my exercise have a negative effect?,"I am on a low calorie diet while doing strength building exercises every 2 days. I have been doing this for a few weeks, and in about 2 weeks will go on a vacation for a week.  While on vacation I won't have access to weights, and will be traveling around backpacker style so won't have access to a gym. Diet will also be a problem just because healthy foods will not be widely available and I won't necessarily have time/facilities to prepare such foods myself.  Will abandoning my diet and workout regime for a week undo a lot of my progress? How bad will the damage be? "
658,Doing Yoga in Socks,"Is doing yoga in regular socks okay? Are the yoga toe socks better, the same, or worse than doing yoga barefoot?   Just a little background: I am going to soon begin a yoga class at my local gym, but I am a bit embarrassed of my feet.  "
659,How much stronger can you get as you get fatter?,"I've heard of people actually just getting really huge (obese) to be able to generate more force. I don't know how effective it is, but I've seen 300-400 lb. people who don't regularly lift weights/go to gyms and can pound the daylights out of regular gym-goers. Not to mention that muscle-size isn't key to strength 100%, so this could explain that the process is biomechanical components to it more than just muscle.  As examples, very heavy people often have larger wrists and chubbier hands, so this could be an automatic advantage in armwreslting, grappling, etc., at least in some ways. Also, heavy people eat huge amounts of calories, so it's possible that they still build power from regular daily activities more than skinnier people would. You also have to consider that heavier people can be much harder to move.  For an example to that previous statement, consider wrestling someone who weighs 400 lbs. and walks the same as someone who weighs 170 lbs. It's extremely unlikely that the heavier person will be easy.  When they walk around, they are carrying 2x or more weight than you are, and they are walking the same as you or more, possibly. Odds are, their legs are pretty powerful without specific workouts.  So I was thinking of having a diet like this - gain weight slowly (fat) and see how the gain increases demands on my body that require adaption and strength gains. Since I can't decide not to walk weighing 300 lbs., but can decide to not squat one day, I am actually forced to get stronger by getting fatter.  This may sound ridiculous at first, but I used to weigh 255 lbs. at 5'9"" at 16 and I could bench 200 lbs. without working out. How? I was active, conditioned to my bodyweight, and could move well. I grew to that weight and that required me to gain much more strength, but not necessarily muscle or health.  I remember being able to lift much heavier weights back then too, specifically over 300 lbs.  Now, I am 21 years old, 5'9"" still, and weigh 200 lbs. Guess what? I can't do any of that anymore.  Also, when you are fat and you come running at a person, they are more likely to fall, even if they are strong weight lifters because your running weight  Not to mention that I hate exercise so much that it's almost like it's genetically coded to not like it, and any exercise I do is not ""natural feeling"", but forced, in any variation/weight/type/form. Being fat is key for me.  My question is, how strong can I get by just getting fatter and adapting to this weight regularly?  I don't care about bench much but want to deadlift 500 lbs. without working out much. If I gain enough weight and lift some random heavy stuff, I think I can come close over years of on-and-off lifting. It doesn't have to be in good form, but I just want to pull it off the ground, even for a 1/4 inch.  Don't tell me that fat doesn't make people stronger because it does. If it didn't, you'll have to explain lots to me then about do nothing people in the 400 lb. range who can lift their own bodyweight in deadlifts without lifting anything but a fork. This guy is an example:    And this one ... both are/were over 500 lbs.    These athletes do not have a strong weight training dedication, yet they prove that they have enough strength to be in professional wrestling at a high-profile level and even boxing. Clearly, as you gain fat, strength comes somehow, depending on how active you stay. I want to be fatter and stronger. "
660,Bodyweight inverted row - where do the elbows go?,"With bodyweight inverted row, or body row, I mean hanging by my arms from somthing, the feet on the ground, the body more or less horizontal (head higher), and pulling myself up between my hands.  I keep my elbows close to my body, pointing towards the feet, mostly because it feels easier to stress both sides symetrically that way. When rowing a boat, your elbows point more outward, same for pulling machines in the gym. I don't know about the equivalent free-weight exercise.   Does it really matter where the elbows point? What is the best position, specifically for body rows, and why?   Edit to add: My hands are slightly wider than shoulders width apart, palms pointing inwards or to my feet (depending on wherre I do the exercise) "
661,Understanding Fat Content on Nutrition Labels,"For most foods that contain fat you'll see Total Fat content and Saturated, Trans Fat, Polyunsaturated, and Monounsaturated fats listed below that.  Sometimes the amounts don't always add up.  Total Fat could be 12g, Saturated Fat at 7g, and Trans Fat at 0g so there's 5g of fat unaccounted for.  Can one assume the remaining fat is some kind of unsaturated fat?  Are there ""neutral"" fats that aren't exactly saturated or unsaturated? "
662,Bodyweight exercises to stimulate fast-twitch muscle growth,"So I want to achieve a slim-athletic physique through only doing body-weight exercises.  As I understand it, after you do more than 12-15ish reps of an exercise per set, you're no longer utilising your fast-twitch muscle fibers which are the ones that are more capable of hypertrophy and so you'll mainly be developing endurance with little strength/size improvement (slow-twitch).  I'd like to reach the max amount of the following exercises that will stimulate all possible fast-twitch muscle growth by working out 3 times a week and then maintain it through training once a week (as I run and do BJJ too...).  Wide-grip Pull-ups: 5?x15 Chin-ups: 5?x15 Explosive push-ups: 5?x15 Handstand push-ups: 5?x6 (due to smaller muscles, more challenging) Jump squats: 5?x15 Deadlift: 5?x12 (60kg barbell...) Planches: 180 secs  and then I'd do variations on these to hit the muscle groups in different places.  Firstly, does this make sense?  Secondly, how many sets of ""up to 12 reps"" (using fast-twitch muscle) does it take before you cross over into endurance training? 3? 4? 5? "
663,"Toenail removed - realistically, how long before I can start running again?","I injured myself accidentally on Friday and wound up in Accident &amp; Emergency (ER) where I had to have an X-Ray and my toenail removed and my toe tidied up a bit. Although I've lost nails before, they've normally just gone black and dropped off without causing me any real pain. This one is rather different and it's incredibly sore, I can barely walk and so I know running isn't going to happen for a bit. I had to have the dressing changed yesterday and while the nurse said it was ""Looking great - exactly what we'd want to see"" I was quite shocked by how ""wet"" it still was.  I have a half marathon in a few months and a couple of 10 mile military endurance races this year, which I need to straight training for in boots and with a bergen (backpack). I'm also meant to be helping my wife train for her marathon, but I suspect I'll miss the boat on that as she'll end up miles ahead of me.  But, I was hoping others with similar experience or knowledge could give me an indication of what I can expect going forwards?   Are these likely to happen, or should I resign myself for 6 months of slow 5km runs? "
664,Is it better to take a nap or work out?,"On days like today, when I've only had 5 or 6 hours of sleep, I often wonder if it would be healthier (in terms of recovery, performance, and so on) to skip my lunchtime workout and take an hour nap instead.  Is it better to skip my workout when I'm sleep deprived and nap instead? If not, should I make any alterations to my routine (such as focus more on strength movements, reduce the amount of cardio, etc)? "
665,Sore stomach muscles from push-ups,"I've recently started a pushup routine and I'm finding that my lower abs are very sore, much more so than my chest and arms.  How should I proceed? Should I add some excercises to strengthen my abs, such as sit-ups or leg lifts? Should I take a break from my schedule (3 days a week) to allow for my stomach muscles to heal? Or should I proceed as scheduled?  I'm about 40, I'm thin but out-of-shape. "
666,Are there Common Dumbbell and Barbell Diameters?,"I have some basic weights, dumbbells and a barbell.  I've always assumed there were 30mm and 50mm diameters for weights, but when I measured my dumbbells they appear to be 25mm and my barbell is 30mm. Could this be correct, are there some other measurement standards? Which size should I my barbell weights be? Are there any problems with 30mm barbell weights? "
667,Learning form without weights,"One thing I like a lot about the Starting Strength program is its focus on squats.  Why? Because I could practice and practice them, getting my form right, without weights.  Now that I can squat well, I'd like to do the other exercises.  Is there a good way to practice them without weights, to get my form right?  (Why practice without weights? 1) It lets me practice at home, a big plus 2) It's much easier to get the form right)  UPDATE: I also have a set of very light dumbbells - could I use those to practice the form? "
668,Best stretches before weight training,"I have a set of stretches I generally do; not sure where I got them from, but they seem to work for me.  (I use them for general stretching, not strength training).  Now that I'm starting weight training, using Starting Strength, is there a specific stretch program I should do? Or should I just do my regular routine? "
669,How to leverage short bicycle ride to work?,"I'm cycling every day to work. It is a very short distance (2km or 1 1/4 miles). I'm usually there in 6-7 minutes.  How would I use this ride to increase my endurance?  I read about tabata, would it make sense to apply it to the short ride? Or another variation  of HIIT? Or something completely different which fits into that time frame? "
670,Should I follow the gym's program or just stick to Starting Strength?,"I'm trying to follow the Starting Strength program, and need some help with the exercises.  The trainers at the gym want you to do a fancy circuit, using some freeweights but mainly machines.  Should I:   Just listen to the trainers?    Ignore them and just use the book?    Tell the trainers I want to follow this program (Squat, Press, etc.), no circuit, no machine, but ask them to help me with my form and spot?  "
671,Eating a big meal around a weightlifting workout - before or after?,When is the best time to eat a big meal when weight training - before or after the workout? Also how much time before or after is optional / beneficial? 
672,Should we do running and lifting on the same day or on different days?,"While putting dishes from dish washer into the cabinets my arms got tired! So time to go back to gym and exercise! If I want to start for the first few weeks with moderate running in target heart zone of my age (32-M) for about 1 or 1.5 miles and also do some some sets of weight lifting that I can do 20lb to 25lb, Is that correct to do these two together in one day? or should I increase the running to 3 miles and one day only do that 3 mile running, the other day do just like half a mile running for a warm up and then just do more lifting?  "
673,Doing Starting Strength once a week,"I'm new to strength training, and, for the time being, can do it only 1 once a week (or maybe every other week).  I do aerobic several times a week, and, currently, can't give it up.  Should I follow Starting Strength and just space it out? Or something else? "
674,Is taking a nap before workout good idea?,"When I come home from work (as a programmer) I am mentally very tired, and thus not able to concentrate on my exercises fully, yawning at the gym even.  Is it a good idea to take a nap for an hour before I go to the gym, or should I go straight from work while my mind is still working? Or should I drink an energy drink with high caffeïne levels to give me an extra boost at the gym?  I don't want to go to the gym too late, because then I get back home too late, and am not able  to have a proper pause between eating and going to bed.  At the gym, I do a little cardio, but mostly bodybuilding. "
675,Muscle spasm/contraction,"Recently I have started a program to strengthen(and learning to activate) specific muscles relating to overpronation(abductor hallucis, flexor digitorum brevis etc.).   After a few weeks I'm now able to activate and control these muscle but unfortunately only for &lt;1-2 sec before the muscle/s contracts(hurts a bit) which forces me to stretch it out. This is substantially seen in the abductor hallucis muscle which forces the big toe to spread out before I align it to the 'normal'(not normal) position.   Is this normal? Do I need to incorporate stretch? Or will it go over over time? "
676,About gaining weight,"I'm 19 years old, 5""7 tall and weight 45kg. What should I do to gain at least 10kg within 1 month without supplements? And is my height normal? "
677,Will taking the stairs daily improve fitness for an obese adult,"I'm an obese adult, weighing 316lbs.    I have started to try and lose some weight and would like to do something about my fitness levels.  I have begun to take the stairs (5 flights) and when I get to the top I am breathless.   My question  If I continue to do this once a day will the breathlessness improve (I'm not sure of the official term for this, but what I mean is, will normal breathing return more quickly, will I sweat less, that sort of thing)? Or would I need to be performing this small exercise a lot more frequently for it to make a difference? Please note that I am NOT asking if climbing the stairs once a day will help me lose weight as I know the calories burned would be negligible.  "
678,Should I really lock my elbows and knees when lifting?,"When bench pressing, at max extension, should I lock my elbows or keep them loose? What about my knees when squatting?  UPDATE: Here are some links from the Mayo Clinic warning against locking joints while lifting: [website][website]2nd UPDATE: Also, must admit, a major concern of mine is that in military, always told us ""Don't lock your knees, you'll pass out"".  This is when standing at inspection. "
679,How should I breathe when lifting?,"I've heard many different things about how to breathe when lifting? What are some clear, simple, common sense, generally accepted ways to breathe when lifting? (Squatting or pressing.)  I'm following Starting Strength, but am hesitant to follow his advice about holding your breathe.  Mayo Clinic advises against holding your breath:     Breathe. You might be tempted to hold your breath while you're lifting weights. Don't. Holding your breath can lead to dangerous increases in blood pressure. Instead, breathe out as you lift the weight and breathe in as you lower the weight.  "
680,When to change Kettle-bell weight?,I have got 20kg kettle bell and able to do 30 swings without exhausting. Should I change the size of kettlebell(32 or 36 kg ?) or increase reps ?   
681,Which set of training weeks should I choose according to the book “Daniels' Running Formula”,"According to the ""Daniels' Running Formula"" book there is a possibility to create training plan for different preparation time (1-24 weeks).    E.g. you have 6 weeks before the running event you want to participate. So according to the book you should pick 3 weeks from Phase I ""Early Season Running"" (Foundation) and 3 weeks from Phase IV ""Tapering and Peaking"" (Final Quality). Each phase has 6 weeks and you should pick only three of them.  So the question is which weeks should I choose in each phase?     Phase I: No.1-3;     Phase IV: No.1-3; OR Phase I: No.1-3;     Phase IV: No.4-6; OR Phase I: No.1, 3, 5; Phase IV: No.1, 3, 5; OR ...?   I could not find any reference which weeks to choose. Also there are some weeks in Phase IV that does not have Competition session, so those weeks should not be the last ones. And it gets even more complicated when we have some but not all weeks from Phase II ""Speed, Strength, and Running Economy training"" (Early quality) and Phase III ""High intensity training"" (Transition quality). "
682,Is Upright Row a good alternative to Overhead Press for people with rounded shoulders?,"I was yesterday night having fun with my two-years old daughter, doing Overhead Presses with an almost weightless aluminium tube, when I realized that my shoulders make cracking noises. I had never heard them in the gym, but now at home I can clearly hear them.  This might be partly because my shoulders are in worse shape than usual, since I am waiting for some light tendonitis to heal, but I suspect it has something to do with the fact that I have bad posture and slightly bent forward shoulders.  According to this answer here in another post:     The posture of the shoulder/scapula is important when doing exercises   to strengthen the Rotator Cuff. If the shoulder is in the rounded position   (from tight pecs or weak scapular muscles) it can put more strain on   the RTC tendons, especially when raising the arms overhead. The cuff   can become impinged between the acromion and the head of the humerus.   Additionally, according to this other text in a blog,     The deltoids are a multidirectional muscle with three distinct   sections (heads) that move the arm in different directions. Overhead   presses target the front and side. However, degree of involvement can   be altered considerably with slight modifications and once again,   balanced development is key. Generally speaking, most people are   overdeveloped in front, which causes the upper arm to rotate inward   and results in a postural deficiency characterized by rounded   shoulders.   Would it be therefore a good idea to look for another basic, compound shoulder exercises that put less emphasis on the Front Delt, for people with rounded shoulders?  According to EXRX, Upright Row is a basic, compound exercise that mainly targets the Lateral Deltoid and not the front. And the list of synergistic muscles includes the Rotator Cuff: Supraspinatus, Infraspinatus and Teres minor. As a comparison, see the Barbell Military Press that works mainly the Front Deltoid.  Therefore the question: is Upright Row a good alternative to Overhead Press for people with rounded shoulders? Why / why not? (within a program such as SS or SL5x5) "
683,Protein supplements for over weight people,Is it good to have protein supplements when over weight ? Is it possible to gain muscles by having proteins while having extra body fat ?  
684,How sports specific is cardio?,"To what degree is cardio/endurance training sports specific?  Are there any academic references detailing it?  Background:  I recently (a little over a month ago) starting training in BJJ.  When I was trying to looking something else up, I came over this question here and more than one answer suggested that cardio is highly sports specific.  But that seems to contradict this article.  It is also at odds with my own very limited experience since my running improved noticeably after I started BJJ.    So, I'm certain there is some degree of cardio being sports specific, but to what degree is it true?  Are there academic citations?  And if it is highly sports specific, is there anything that would help for those of us that can't make it to the gym as often as we like due to schedule conflicts (single person drills, etc)?  Thank you. "
685,"Starting musculation at 30 years old, is it good?","I want to start musculation soon.  I am 30 years old, I am 183cm / 77 kilogrames, the last time I did sport it was maybe 1 year and a half ago.  I wanted to know if to be 30 years old could be more challenging to get muscles ? Should I eat more ? do more efforts than youngers ? Will my muscles be slowly developed because of my age ?  Thank you. "
686,Is there an alternative way to warm up for lifts that is less tedious than gradually increasing the set weight?,"I'm following a 3x5 weight lifting program based off of the Stronglifts and Starting Strength programs. I've been starting with warm-up sets of gradually increasing weight, as suggested by Stronglifts and Starting Strength. For example Starting Strength recommends the following warm-up for a 225 lbs work set of squats:   5 reps at 45 lbs 5 reps at 45 lbs (again) 5 reps at 95 lbs 3 reps at 135 lbs 2 reps at 185 lbs   After warming up as above, a lifter would then do his 3 sets of 225 lbs x 5 reps.   I've been warming up in this style, but I find it really tedious and time consuming. Adding/removing plates after every set, and then double-checking to make sure I haven't made a mistake like putting more weight on one side than the other (I've done this more times than I care to admit)... it just really sucks my enthusiasm out of my workout. I'd like to get my 3-exercise workout (Squat/Bench Press/Barbell Row, or Squat/Overhead Press/Deadlift) down to a half hour or less, whereas with all the warm up sets it usually takes me more than an hour at present.  So my question is, is there an alternative way I could be warming up that's faster and less tedious? I don't want to increase my risk of injury by insufficiently warming up. But if there's a way to reduce the amount of patience needed for my workouts it'd be great. Just one idea I had - what if I just did like 15 fast reps with 1/3-1/2 of the work weight and then did my work sets? (That might be a terrible idea for all I know. I'm just speculating at what might work). "
687,Which personal trainer certifications are most respected?,"I'm considering pursuing Personal Trainer certification, and I quickly realized there are a large number of organizations that offer personal training, including:   ACE NPTI NASM ACSM NSCA NCSF ...?   This random website lists these and a bunch more (it's where I got the above organizations from, to be honest), but I don't even know whether that site is trustworthy, particularly for the ""industry recognition"" row. Which certification, if any, is the best to pursue? "
688,Avoiding banned substances,"I'm looking around for some good supplements and have been recommended Matrix Anabolic Gold, but I'm keen to check there's no banned substances in it. informed-sport.com is good for checking a manufacturer is safe, but does anyone know if because it isn't registered, it's because it contains banned substances? Or if it's simply not been considered? The word anabolic in the title is just a marketing ploy I presume, which I'm not enticed or put off by, but the reviews are very good.  I'm anticipating a few people saying buy organic, but I'm not convinced that something being ""natural"" is better, so I'm open to all suggestions. If this Matrix stuff is not safe because of doping or contamination, my default is myprotein.com. Thanks "
689,What EXACTLY do I do to get my resting heart rate down to below 40?,"I tried sprinting for a month and it didn't budge. Now I'm doing long-distance running, but I absolutely hate it. I just want to get my heart rate down to an athletic level as quickly as possible so I can focus on other, funner things/maintain it with other, funner things (like getting muscular, strong, and powerful).  How do I get it down to below 40? How fast does it take to get your heart rate down at all? Also, is a high resting heart rate part of the reason why you get tired quickly? "
690,Negative rep workouts - how often?,"Negative reps, i.e. reps that focus on the eccentric part of the movement rather than the concentric, are supposed to result in more intensive damage to your muscle, and have also been shown to give better results than concentric-only exercise.  However, a lot of people seem to think that you shouldn't do these kinds of workouts too often, certainly not every time.   I see two different ways of doing eccentric workouts. One is to load super-one-rep-max weight and lower it, for example when squatting with safety bar, or doing negative reps for pullups when you're not strong enough to do them the regular way.  The other way would be to use slightly lower weight than usual and use very slow eccentric movements, subjectively, this feels like it's very taxing on your muscles as well, it certainly makes you more tired, but is it as effective?  In either way of doing them, how often would you suggest that you do this? Once per week? "
691,Heart rate monitor on a smartwatch,"Does a smartwatch take into account heart rate when it computes calories burned?   I know there are a number of personal factors (Age, weight etc) that go into the equation, and of course your movement/steps but if you were to workout on a elliptical with your hands on the stationary handle bars would your fitness tracker compute  your calories burned from just your heart rate?   Is this even possible?  "
692,Correct exercise extension,"I am getting a bit confused with extension exercises, e.g. Back Extension and Glute extension. I don't have a specific machine, so I improvise using my normal bench to do it.  What is the difference between the two? Right now, I keep my body up to my pelvis on the bench and do the extension. Do I need to keep my lower back on the bench too? I think that will round my back, which I saw on the internet is bad.   Can you please advise how to do a correct back extension so that hip flexion does not come in to play? "
693,After Pregnancy: exercise to close gap in vertical muscles in abs,"In ""What to Expect When You're Expecting"" after birth of baby, it advises to close the gap in your vertical ab muscles before going back to a strenuous routine. My questions are:  1) checking for the gap: I think this is going to be pretty easy to tell? Just palpating my abs to see if there is a gap (soft spot) in the middle of my belly?   2) the description for the work-out to close this gap is:  ""While on your back (""the basic position"") inhale, cross your hands over your abdomen, using your fingers to draw the sides of your ab muscles together as you breathe out, pulling your belly button inward toward the spine while raising your head slowly. Exhale as you lower your head.""  I've translated this to: Inhale, raise head (so abs are clenched), massage abs inward as you exhale and lower head.  Is that right? Does anybody have recommendations for other ""closing the gap"" exercises?  3) I had a pretty strong core before pregnancy, what if I can't detect a gap? Should I just do some ""closing"" exercises just to be sure? Should I see a sports doctor to verify?  Thanks for the feedback! "
694,Does being cold help lose weight?,"I heard on Doctor Oz once that drinking cold water can help burn calories in a rather passive way since the body will have to work to warm it back up. Would this concept work practically in general? Could I just turn down the thermostat some, and it help me lose weight? "
695,Exercising at higher temperatures,"Aside from the obvious safety concerns of heat exhaustion, heat stroke, heat prostration, etc., what is known about the detriments or benefits of exercising at higher-than-comfortable temperature/humidity?  To put it concretely, the gym I currently use has a room temperature these days of perhaps 75 F, with fairly muggy humidity.  I find that much higher than I'd prefer to exercise in, particularly for running on a treadmill (at a 7:30--8:30/min pace).  I would ideally enjoy 66 F with low humidity,  At the current temperature/humidity I sweat profusely and have been backing off of my previous exertion on the treadmill out of basic caution, though it strongly feels I could continue at a higher exertion without any risk of serious harm.  (I am well hydrated and have never felt close to dizzy or anything like that--just tired.  And hot.)  But I am concerned about less obvious harm...  And so, what I want to know is:  is there evidence to show that sustained hard exercise at higher temperatures/humidity has any subtler systemic harm (that is, subtler than the obvious ones listed above)?  I mean, is it ""bad for your brain""  Or other organs?  Does it put too much stress on your system?    Or is training in conditions in which sweating is profuse and sustained actually good training in some sense?  Such as training your system to be more efficient or other benefits?    "
696,How few weight lifting exercises can I do and still get a good workout of the back muscles?,"I have just spent 1 month working out with weights in a gym. Currently I am doing pull downs (not yet strong enough for pull ups) and seated rowing for my back. The seated rowing seems to be involving the lower back muscles a bit, but still I am considering adding back extensions. Also I am wondering if I should add 1 or 2 stabilizing exercises e.g. the plank.  My goal is to a have a strong and healthy (functional) back, not to look big.  On the other hand my preference is to do as few exercises as possible and with relative heavy weights (10-12 reps per set).   With that in mind I was wondering if it would be possible to reduce the numbers of exercises?  More spesifically I was wondering if dead lifting + 1 stabilizing exercise (which?) would be enough?   "
697,What quiet exercises should I be fitting into a short morning workout for all-round fitness?,"I'm a 40 year old man who manages to maintain a basic level of fitness. Most days I do a couple of sets of press-ups, walk my 10,000 steps and cycle a couple of miles. But I'm not kidding myself that I'm anything other than one step above ""totally unfit"".  In the years before children, I regularly hiked, scrambled and hillwalked. That's all gone by the wayside now. But I'm hoping that in a few years, when I have more free time, it'll become a possibility again. But I'm worried that if I don't keep up a minimal level of fitness, I won't be able to ""re-train"" my body when I hit 50.  I'm very busy, and I don't have much time to devote to fitness. Joining a gym is out of the question, as is devoting more than 10-15 minutes more than I already do to fitness.   What I'd like to be able to do is get up earlier and fit in some exercise before everyone else in the house is awake. It seems a good time of day to do it: get the blood flowing, enjoy the benefits of heightened metabolism, get the pain out of the way. But in order to do this, I have to be quiet so as not to disturb sleeping children. So it can't involve any vigorous activity like star jumps, or step-ups.  I also have no specialist equipment - not even free weights - and there's not room in my house to store anything bigger than perhaps a wrist-strap weight. So unless someone's starting making weights out of the hearts of neutron stars, it's body weight only exercises.  So my question is this: if I do 10 minutes of quiet bodyweight-based exercises like press-ups, planks or wall sits in the morning, is it going to be valuable for my strength and fitness? And if so, what quiet exercises should I be trying to fit in to those 10 minutes for a decent round-body workout? "
698,Why Aren't I More Tone?,"For the last four months I have been doing the Insanity workout. During this time I have decreased the amount of food I eat to about 1800-2000 calories a day. I drink the recommended amount of water one needs (about 8 cups) daily, and I never eat junk food. I drink a whey isolate protein after my workout (one 29g scoop), I take the ACG^3 pre-workout formula before exercising (one scoop), I take 12 Censor (a CLA supplement) capsules daily, and I get about 8-8 1/2 hours of sleep every night. Over these four months I went from 195lb to 175lb. I'm much stronger and feel really healthy, and I'm fairly tone everywhere except for my stomach. I exercise my abs daily and they've gotten lots stronger, but I'm not seeing definition unless I grab my excess flab and pull it down so I can see where it is covering up my abs. What's going on? I want the definition, and I'm working really hard every day for it. The abs are definitely there, but how do I get it to look like they are there? "
699,Hypoglycemic persons gym plan?,"Hypoglycemia, also known as low blood sugar, is when blood sugar decreases to below normal levels. This may result in a variety of symptoms including clumsiness, trouble talking, confusion, loss of consciousness, seizures, or death. A feeling of hunger, sweating, shakiness, and weakness may also be present.  So what should be Hypoglycemic person gym plan?  Should a Hypoglycemic person focus on cardio, weightlifting or CrossFit? "
700,Average Muscle breakdown by percentage (by weight) of the total,"One often hears lower body accounts for 40% of total muscles mass. Going a step further, would it be possible to estimate for an average body, a given muscle group percentage of the total?   Is there a site which would list all muscles in the body by percentage?   For example: Quadriceps are 23% of the total muscles. Biceps are 10%....  Average, not precise, of course it would vary widely, just seeking averages. "
701,strengthing and improving flexibility in heels,"I've got one of those lazy ""Ididntexerciseinalongtime"" heels which is causing improper form on my squats. I've spoken to some knowledgeable fellas at my gym  and they pinpointed my weakness in my squat form is my heels and their inability to flex when coming down (they lift up).  My stats are 5foot9 (175cm) I'm 80kgs, 28 years old and as I first said, I haven't done a lot of exercising for a good 5 years.   My personal trainer told me to stick some 5kg plates under my heels which has helped tremendously on my squat form, but I shouldn't and don't want to rely on doing my squats forever this way. He also gave me some stretching tips to try and gain some flexibility into my heels, which were doing free weight squats at home and squatting as low as I can go while maintaining my heel to the ground with both legs in uniform (1 leg in front of the other).  I'm squatting 80kgs easily, to the point that I need to lift a heavier weight, but it'd be pointless to squat heavier with a crappy form (even with a mediocre form using the plates, I'm a bit worried I'll damage my knees). Specifically doing back squats, although I am practising front squats for power clean form.  Is there any other exercises or something I can do to gain some more flexibility in my heels?  [edit 29/03/2011] Added Youtube links showing me doing my squat   Olympic Bar only back squat (no plates under heels) 60kg Back Squat (plates under heels)   My bad on the recording them wrong way round (I wasn't filming obviously! ;).

702,Are there actually substances that can make a person not just larger but also taller?,"Sometimes I see adverts on internet peddling supplements that seems to be able to make a person, not just bigger, but also taller?  Are any chemicals (whether legal or illegal) actually able to do something like that? "
703,"What are the biological processes behind the sensation of ""being hungry""?","I'm trying to work out if there is a particular diet or habits around eating that would minimize the sensation of ""being hungry"".  Is ""being hungry"" a psychological sensation determined simply by the habit of eating at specific times during the day? Are there any observable biological processes associated with hunger? Is it driven by an empty stomach or some other biological process? Are there any particular hormones associated with hunger? "
704,"The relationship between basal metabolic rate, calories, and activity level","I have a base BMR of about 2200 calories without the activity multiplier using this formula:  66 + (6.23*240) + (12.7 * 70) - (6.88*31)   I supervise an automotive shop and generally consider walking, sitting, and standing as my daily activities (about 1500 calories burned using weight times METS). In the context of weight loss and calorie intake and calories burned, would my said daily activities be the multiplier (1.2) or is that multiplier added in regardless of what daily activity is?  I ask because 2200 x 1.2 would be 2640 calories burned + work = 4140 which seems high. Without the multiplier 2200 + 1500 = 3700 still seems high. If I'm deducting 500 per day, 3200 calories seems really high. I'm 240lbs with a 5'10"" frame and this doesn't really make sense to me. Am I missing something? Is my estimation on calories burned for my daily activities way off? I consume anywhere from 2000 to 3000 calories per day on average. "
705,Lifting limits guide for different exercises?,"I'm am wondering if someone could provide a reference to a scale or explain the limits of how much it is possible to lift for different exercises, based on how much you can lift in one exercise.  For example, I have seen many people state that the amount you can lift in an overhead military press (as demonstrated in the picture), is about 2/3rds of what you can lift in a benchpress.  So if someone can lift 60lbs in a military overhead press they can bench 90lbs -- is this scale correct?  If so, is there any reference to see how much, on average, it would be possible to lift in other exercises?  Thank you. "
706,How long should a person stick to the same weightlifting routine?,"I have heard various opinions on how long a person should stick to a weightlifting routine before changing it up.  Some have mentioned 8 weeks, others 12 weeks.  How long should duration be?  Also, should the routine be changed drastically?  So can some of the staples of lifting like the flat bench press be kept in the routine? "
707,How far is a good length of running for children?,"My daughter is 12 years old, she plays soccer competitively, and she runs four miles every day. She has been known to stress her body by exercising too much. Lately, she has been wanting to run further to improve her endurance. I have been hesitant to let her, because I am afraid she will stress her body. Is there a way to know if she is working too hard? Is there some sort of formula to see how far she should be able to run? Please advise. "
708,"How to combine strength, hypertrophy and stability in one weight training program","I just read about a training program used by US Army Rangers: [website]This program seems attractive since it consist of three parts: strength, hypertrophy and stability whereas many other, eg. PHAT: [website]However there is one thing I do not understand: each part is trained for 1 full week. I think of stabilizing exercises as involving other (core) and smaller muscles than the ordinary exercises. This would mean that these muscles would only be trained every 3rd week. How can these muscles become stronger with so seldom training?   Would it not be better to train like this ?:  Week 1  1 day stability, 2 day strength  Week 2  1 day hypertrophy, 2 day stability  Week 3  1 day strength, 2 day hypertrophy "
709,Aerobic capacity standards/classifications,"Most strength sports have classifications and standards to assist athletes in the assessment of their current performance level. For example, these are the standards for men, ordered by weight class, for RAW Powerlifting (squat, bench and deadlift):    Is there anything similar for aerobic exercise? For example, what are decent times for a 400 m sprint, for a 5k run, or for a century ride?   "
710,How to lose weight when morbidly obese,"I am a very overweight man at 400lbs (181 kg). I've been told by several doctors that I need to lose weight or else my health will get worse and worse.  What exercises are safe for a large person? For weight training I'm wary of doing squats since every time I've tried I end up with sore knees and have problems walking. I've also found that most cardio programs have the same effect.  For losing weight should I be concentrating on cardio or weight training? Is it better to exercise or should I just change my eating habits?  What are some good websites for teaching myself proper nutritional information? I've heard the old adage ""eat less"", but considering that most of my meals are from fast food restaurants, I have no idea of what kinds or proportions of foods I should be eating. "
711,Center-less barbell. Would it be the same?,"I've recently gotten into olympic lifting, and, after thoroughly watching dropped weighted barbells mangle people, I had the idea of a center-less barbell:    Would the lift be the same if the roundabout piping was structurally rigid? I'm aware that you should take it slow and steady and be safe when progressing with your lifts, particularly a snatch, and to keep your stance so that a drop will fall behind you, but I want to know can you train on something like this and still perform successfully on a traditional barbell? Where the whole ""center-less barbell"" is 20kg. It would also have to be suspended or hang below a platform... "
712,Best way to work the back without putting myself out of commission?,"I love doing back weight exersises, especially the Seated Cable Rows with a narrow grip with the stack set at my body weight of 210lbs.  On two occasions I've performed 3 sets of 10 reps and I feel great afterwards. But then I'll be out of commission for a week while my body recovers.    So how do I change this workout?  Decrease the number of reps, sets or less weight?  I'm afraid of doing less weight to failure and ending up worse. "
713,How long should you avoid eating before running a 5K?,"If the race is early in the morning, is it unwise to skip breakfast beforehand? How long should you avoid eating before running a 5K?   I normally finish in twenty-one minutes, and the race is at 8:30AM. "

715,Reducing flab and Building the Upper Body simultaneously - Guidance?,"I have recently joined a gym, and I wanted to build both the abdomen (6-8 packs) and upper body (chest and shoulders). I have used a gym two years back. I have the following questions:   How I distribute my exercises both daily or alternatively? Is it necessary for me to run before doing this? I am jogging 3 kms on a treadmill. Is this too little or too much? I am not fat but have gained some flab over time. I am 27 and weigh 72 kg (158.7 lbs). Breathing patterns for each of them. Few good exercises for each of them. Is it okay to drink soda-aerated water/lemonade after the exercise?  "
716,Why do my legs hurt while jumping rope?,"I used to skip in the passed, but always ended up stopping after a week when I could no longer handle the pain in the lower legs, i.e. knees, shins, feet. Looking at these diagrams from Foottrainer.com:    I would say, most of the pains are at or close to the:   Plantar aponeurosis Calcaneal tendon Tibialis anterior Plus knee pains (which seem to be under the knee caps, at the inner sides of the knees)   Will getting better footwear get rid of the buildup of pain, or do I need to do leg/feet specific stretching/warmups/cooldowns to stop the pain buildup?  In the past, I used to warm my legs up on the stationary bike, but did not do any stretching.  So I don't know if the pain was because of the footwear, lack of leg/feet specific stretching or a combination of both?  Note: I am not in pain at the moment, the pain starts 1 day after jumping rope, and after that day, if I continue every day or every other day, the pain would continue to increase. It would take over a week of no jumping rope for the pains to subside. "
717,"On the influence of the total number of sets, particularly with regard to tendon progress","I am staying away from the ""as-much-as-you-can"". Now, in the dumbbells part of my workout I simply mimic a linear load progression at fixed number of reps, á la SL5x5. I just use smaller increments and a slightly higher rep range.  But I need an explanation of what I should do with the number of sets. What is the recommendation for a middle-aged person whose priority is to avoid screwing up his tendons?  Is it safer to restrict the number of sets to 3 instead of 5, or will that inhibit the progress too much? I don't mind to slow down the progress (as long as there is some) if that is safer.  Specially, my priority is giving room for my wrist tendons to keep up with the progress. In most workouts plans I have seen, the number of sets specifically dedicated to forearms is usually low in relation to the main exercises. But I don't know if that is due to the fact that the forearm training is seen as a mere addition that should not interfere with the big exercises, or if that is due to an specific need of low volume for the most grip-taxing exercises.  In any case, my question is about the number of sets in general, not only for the forearm specific work, since wrists take part in nearly all exercises. "
718,My steady-state running speed doesn't seem to increase,"First off all the best wishes to everyone! May you all achieve new sportive heights this year :)  I have a small question. I did a cardio-test last year to determine my heartrate-zones. Together with a training-plan. The doctor told me that doing speedwork as noted in the results would increase my steady-state speed. Yet I did all the exercises the last couple of (6) months and yet I still keep running at 9'15""/mile (5'45""/km) and I don't notice any (not even slightly) difference in my heart-rate whilst running at that pace.  Is it possible to increase the base-running speed? If so how long does it take before the intensive training (intervals &amp; repeats) start to influence this speed?  Any advice (or new insights) would be greatly appreciated.  FYI: The training-schedule for this week (but similar to every other week). Monday: 1h of easy running (5'45""-6'/km). Heart rate below aerobic threshold Tuesday: 10' Warmup -  5 times( 1 mile at 5'/km + 0.5mile at 6'/km). Heart rate between Aerobic &amp; lactate-treshold - 10' Cooldown Thursday: 10' Warmup - 5 times (4' All-out + 2' recovery). Heart rate during interval higher then lactate-treshhold - 10' Cooldown Friday: 30min to 40min easy - running at 6'/km. Heart rate below aerobic threshold Sunday: 2h Easy Running - (5'45""-6'/km). Heart rate below aerobic threshold   Note 1   Sleep is OK (8h to 9h) each day easily losing weight isn't an option. I'm already very thin: BMI: 21 / fat percentage: 10 to 15%   Note 2 I did a heart-performance test with a specialised doctor &amp; this was the output   &lt;145 bpm (fat burn zone) 145bpm - 155bpm (lsd-zone) 155bpm aerobic threshold (achieved while running for a long time at 5'45""/km) 156bpm - 163bpm (extensive zone) 163bpm - 169bpm (intensive zone) 170bpm (=lactate treshhold)  "
719,When does musclar atrophy take place?,"Both my father and my grandfathers have fairly large muscular frames. However, they haven't worked out since they were much younger. How is it possible for them to maintain this muscle mass without working out? Is the extent of muscular atrophy different in everyone? Could it be genetic?  Note: With the exception of yard work and occasionally moving heavy objects they are mostly sedentary.  "
720,Does the fructose in my supplement hinder my cycling routine?,"Products like CYTOMAX (with Stevia) boast enhanced energy for endurance sports, and I have certainly felt a boost at times when I need it. However my local nutritionist said that Fructose inside it increases lactate levels and also hampers fat burning.  My main goals are to get better at sprinting up the climbs with reduced lactate burn, and also burn body fat overall with my workouts. Should I stop using products with Fructose in it? Will this help reduce that lactate burn? "
721,Gaining weight - carbohydrate and proteins?,"I would like to gain some more weight before the summer. How would I achieve that the most effectively?

723,Is working out a healthy alternative to combat RSI (Repetitive Stress Injuries),"I was reading questions on Programmers and I came across this one where a use is having issues with a Repetitive Stress Injury from typing. It got me thinking, is exercise alone a viable alternative therapy to correct the problems that cause RSI?   From what I understand (and I'm probably wrong), RSI problems like Carpel Tunnel Syndrome or Kyphosis (Hunchback) not related to spinal disorders are caused by repetitive action or posture in an awkward position that causes muscles to strengthen in an unnatural manner (Ie out of balance).  If I'm feeling mild (intermittent not consistent) pain in my wrists, doing wrist exercises helps relieve the pain. Or, if my back is starting to hurt from working on a laptop that core/back exercises are an effective way to correct my posture (and get rid of the soreness).    Forearm workout  First you need to make a little setup:   Find a short (or cut-off) broomstick Find a weight (5/10/15lb plate with a handle works best) or cinder block Grab a 5 ft length of string (parachute cord works best)  Tie one end of the string to the center of the broomstick (clove hitch knot or two for additional strength) The the other end to the weight (same as the broomstick)   For the exercise...  Grab the broomstick in front of you with both hands spread apart, palms down, with the cord dangling down between (elbows hanging down slightly bent) and proceed to roll up the cord onto the broomstick in the same manner that you'd roll up a flag onto a flag pole.  After a few of those, change the direction that you roll up the cord (to target the opposite side of the forearm).     These types of exercises seem work for me but are they really a viable alternative to traditional treatment? Or, is there something I completely missed about the causes of RSI?  Disclaimer: The question talks about measures to prevent severe RSI injuries not cure an an existing severe injury. If your RSI gets bad enough that you feel consistent pain and/or numbness see a doctor.     Update:  I found this video from this question containing some really good stretches to target specific tendons in the wrists that may be causing the pain.  "
724,Need to gain strength to gain muscle?,"I've been strength training 4 days a week for about 8 months. My goal is to increase mass. The usual recommendation for this is to do three sets of 8-12 repetitions for most exercises, and that's what I'm doing. I try to pick a weight so that I reach failure within 8-12 repetitions for each of the three sets, and if I can do 12-10 on each set, I increase the weight. I made great progress in both strength and mass when I was starting out, but lately I seem to be plateauing: on each workout I can only struggle out 0-2 more reps per set than the workout before, and it takes me several workouts to increase weights now.  My question is if continuing like this will efficiently build muscle mass, even though I seem to make very modest strength gains, or do I need to change my workout? (It of course sounds obvious that you need to get stronger in order to encourage the body to build muscle, but maybe it is enough for muscle growth to continually challenge the muscles, and not necessarily get much stronger?)  Some possibilities for change I am considering: changing my routine (I've been doing the same exercises for many months now, mostly isolation exercises); do sets of 6-8 repetitions instead so that I can increase in strength. "
725,Exercises for toned abs that aren't detrimental to back health?,"According to this article, all forms of crunches are bad for your back, because they flex the spine.  Regardless of whether or not this is 100% accurate, I would like to know if there are any ab exercises I can perform which involve little-to-no flexion of the spine, yet still exercise the muscles enough to achieve a toned look.  The article mentions these exercises which are safe for the back:   Bridges Planks Leg extensions ? (Side note: does anyone know which exercise they are referring to?) Bird dogs Stir the pot   In all of these exercises, it looks like the rectus abdominis muscles are exercised isometrically. Is that really enough in order to achieve a toned ab look? If not, can you recommend any alternative exercises which don't involve spinal flexion?  Say I do use an exercise which tones the abs without requiring flexing the spine, would it take a lot longer to build muscles than the traditional way (i.e. sit-ups, crunches, etc.)? Also, would it be more likely that I would plateau a lot sooner?  Note: I realize that in order to get toned abs, you need a combination of very low body fat in addition to significant abdominal muscle mass. "
726,Carbohydrates prior to running,"I know that a lot of runners stock up on carbs before a run. What is the benefit of this? I've heard some people say that you'll ""hit a wall"" if you don't take in some carbs before running. I'm assuming this is like hitting a plateau in your running ability where you can't progress any further. Is this true?  I'm on a ketogenic diet (low/no-carb) normally, but it seems I definitely perform better when I have some carbs before a run. Why do carbs make such a big difference during exercise while ketone bodies are fine for fuel all the rest of the day? "
727,How do I perform a micoach assessment workout?,"I have Adidas micoach Pacer and plan to do start a marathon program. But first I want to do an assessment workout, to make sure I have my Pacer uses the right zone settings.     However, I've never done an assessment workout and I wonder how I should dosage my running speed, as I don't have any idea how fast I would be running in my red zone. Here's an example of my latest workout, to give you an idea of how heart rate and pace. Obviously these zones aren't necessarily correct, so I may have been slacking all this time!    So how to determine how much faster (in paces/min for example) I should be going to reach my peak? Or does this simply not matter for a correct assessment?  Just as an update, here's my assessment workout:    I underestimated how short the interval between 7 and 8 was and forgot about the fact that there's no level 10. Still, it seems about right compared to the VO2max tests I had back in grad school. "
728,How many carbs before a run?,"What's the best form to get carbohydrates in prior to running, and how much should one take in, and how long before the workout? I know I had an easier time running when I had some breaded and fried chicken (not sure how many carbs in the breading) one day before a run, but I had some chocolate before my run today (8g carbs) and it didn't help nearly as much. Is it the amount of carbs, or is it the type of carbs, or possibly a combination of both? I'm currently doing interval running during which I burn approximately ~1000 calories (+/- 150 depending on the day and workout).  I've been on a low-carb diet, and I'm comfortable with breaking that if I need to in order to have energy for running, I just don't want to overdo it and take in more than is required for energy for my run, since I still have some weight to lose.  "
729,Building abs and shaping up muscles,"I have been working out since 3 months. Initially, my aim was to increase weight. I increased my weight by 3 kgs during this time.  Now I feel confident and comfortable lifting moderately heavy weights. So, I want to shift my focus in giving my body a good muscular build.   Presently my workout is of 6 days a week. I workout for 1 hr. My weight is 59 kg and height is 175 cms. Workout basically consists of each body part each day; warmups included.   I want to ask, whether to get a more muscular look, do I have to include anything else in my routine? I also want to ramp up my exercises to achieve my goal. In what direction should I spend my energy - exercise, now? "
730,Establishing a proper push-up form for younger children,"I work with lots of youths, and there a number of them that don't adhere to the proper push-up position. Rather than keeping their bodies straight, they will stick their butts up in the air. When they do ""push-ups"" they tend to just move their hips up and down while keeping their arms static.  Understandably, some children lack the strength to hold themselves up, but I want to encourage the strength build-up over time rather than have a bad habit develop. I get the impression that the youth who can't do a proper push-up will just go on auto-pilot without consciously telling their bodies what to execute in terms of movement and control.  What are ways to move towards the right position and maintain it (without the use of any extra props)? Saying ""keep your body straight/flat"" or ""don't stick your butt up in the air"" does not click for some younger ones. Are there better ways to describe what to do and ""trick"" their minds to get their bodies to listen? "
731,Best way of doing a Negative Split,"Last weekend, I ran a 13K competition and repeated an old mistake, starting out too fast and getting hit with the hammer after 5km, making the last 8km very slow and painful. At the time, I felt like I was running easily enough at 12km/h, but got a big hit after the first round (it was pretty hot too).  A friend of mine suggested switching to the Negative Split method, because it also gives your body time to 'warm up' as it were and because its psychologically easier to speed up at the end and 'catch' people.  How do you calculate what pace to use at your negative split though? And do you split the race in two or in three?  Any pointers on this negative split method would be highly appreciated.  FYi, I'm 37 and currently running between 11km/h and 11.5km/h depending on distance.  Sam "

734,how to train for sit and reach?,"One of my physical fitness test is called sit and reach.  What are the best methods to train for this ""exercise""?  Yes, I do agree that it requires flexibility. However, I heard of different methods from friends on the use of correct muscles.  Some says it uses abs, while others says it's the back or the legs!  Is there a proper method? What should I look at when I'm doing sit and reach? "
735,Exercises for bow legs?,"My friend is 16 years old and has slight bow legs. He can't afford physiotherapy, but I've seen many exercises online that I want to share with him. I'm just not sure which are the best, or how many to do. I know he should strengthen his adductors, but which other muscles? What are your suggestions for exercises? "
736,How much protein should I eat on off-days?,"I'm aware that eating protein is important on the day of your weight lifting session. The most important time to eat protein is right after the session. But I've never heard advice on when to eat and how much protein to eat on off-days. How quickly does your muscle's need for protein diminish over time? My guess is that the 1-2 hours right after the weight lifting are crucial. Then the night of sleep uses moderate amounts. Then on the next day (the off day), you need minimal amounts of protein. Is this correct? "
737,When should I reduce my training intensity before a competition?,"I'm on a more or less intense training regime in the last few weeks. As I have a bike race coming up in two weeks I need to find the time to begin slowing down my training and start a short resting phase before the race.  Mo: Strength Tu: Cardio We: Strength Th: Cardio Fr: Strength Sa: Party Su: Pizza   Cardio primarily means biking for some hours (50-100km) in the afternoon. Depending on my mood and the weather I sometimes add half an hour of swimming in the morning. Strength means Stronglifts 5x5, as I just restarted it the weight ranges are in the lower area (around 30-40kg depending on the exercise). I add some bodyweight exercises (push ups, pull ups, headstands, planks etc), yoga and other cardio every now and then when I am bored.    The race is two weeks from now on a Saturday, how should I reduce the training intensity? When to stop adding weight to 5x5? On which day should I stop lifting completely?  Note: I know this workout program smells like overtraining, please ignore that fact. I know it myself, I can currently keep up to it and am more interested in the fun of exercising than gains. Additionally I can't keep it up for much longer as soon as I have to study again. Note2: Ignore that this question is about a specific event, simply answer like the event is still 2 weeks from now, as there will always be another race two weeks from now. "
738,Why is it so hard to restart running if you stop?,"When I run, after I have run enough to feel tired, if I stop, for even a bit, it becomes incredibly painful to restart. The pain is muscle pain, in all the muscles that I use to run.  I am often able to slow down enough to get a rest without stopping and restarting. If I do this, I feel no pain.  Why does this happen? Is there anything that can be done to mitigate it? "
739,How effective are Kneeling Cable Crunches?,"They're not the most well-known ab isolation exercise, but they are documented on exrx and Icecream Fitness 5x5 recommends them as the only ab isolation needed in the routine.   Does anyone know/have a reference to whether they are worth doing over regular crunches or other core work?   They are a pretty fun movement. "
740,How do my eating habits affect my recovery?,"I'm somewhat overweight (BMI of 28) and mainly sit behind my desk all day, so I've been on quite a calorie deprived diet. I go running about three times a week for half an hour and occasionally go cycling. I also get sufficient sleep, so I get plenty of rest.  My vegetarian diet feels pretty balanced, I get sufficient fibers, fruit, vegetables and eat meat-replacements.  So now I'm wondering how do your eating habits affect your recovery?  Do you need some minimal amount of certain nutrients when working out or is there no need to worry as long as you don't have any physical complaints?   I was wondering about this, because I was starting to get more DOMS, while I didn't significantly change my workouts but did reduce my calorie intake.  I'd like some more specific examples on how to balance calorie restriction with full spectrum nutrient replacement (Both macro and micro). "
741,How often to take measurements?,"How often should someone trying to gain muscle mass take measurements?  The only answer I could find was for weight loss, which from experience shouldn't be more than once a month.  Can that information be used to alter my training routine to work harder, determine if I'm eating enough protein.  I know that when I was losing weight, I could alter my diet and within a day or two I could see the outcome of what I had consumed.    I know it will take a lot longer to see the results from a hard workout, but what is the usual turn around time, 2 - 3 months? "
742,Getting ready for outdoor work as a knowledge worker,"I'll be going on a trip in about a year that's going to require some fairly heavy physical labor. Last time I went, I thought I was in fairly decent shape and still got knocked around. This time I'd like to be better prepared.  Only problem is I'm not super great at committing to a ""workout"". So here's my question: how have you gotten over the hump of getting started to build a habit of working out?  Things I've considered:   Graph paper, set a goal and try to reach it Beeminder? Forcing myself to do it (sounds inefficient...)   (I've got a plan in mind, as well, dumbells at home in the morning. Doable?) "
743,How to Create an Optimized Diet for Muscle Gain,"I have seen a lot of information on the internet about diets for bodybuilding. The information seems to change depending on the writer of the article. Everyone seems to have their own suggestions on how many carbs/protein/fat one should take based on their body weight when pursuing muscle gains. I am beginning to get confused...  A lot of the diets suggest for example, protein percentages related to your bodyweight that seem excessive to me. I was told by my physician that protein intake for someone highly active should be your bodyweight in kilograms multiplied by 1.5 at a high end and yet I see programs suggesting 2g per pound. Wouldn't this over time damage your kidneys?  How can one scientifically create a meal plan that is optimized for gaining muscle and mass with so much conflicting information out there? Also, how can this be done safely (without putting an excessive amount of stress on your body)?  I am 165lbs, 6'0 and in reasonable physical condition. I would like to put on 10 lbs of muscle for example. "
744,What's the logic behind the Food Pyramid,"People these days seem to all be crazy about low carb, slow carb, Atkins, and South Beach diets, but the USDA Food Pyramid suggests we eat more grains than anything else in a day, with at least half of those being whole grains. Specifically for me to gradually lose weight, the interactive tools at mypyramid.gov suggest I eat the following daily:   6.5 ounces of meats and beans 3 cups of milk/dairy 2 cups of fruits 3.5 cups of vegetables 9 ounces of grains   Why is there such an emphasis on grains? Would I be missing out on some sort of nutritional goodness if I ate 9 ounces of meat and 6.5 ounces of grains instead? What about the 4.5 ounces of grains that aren't whole? Won't they spike my blood sugars and drive me nuts? What about the rest of the Pyramid? If I hate fruits and eat veggies instead, am I going to be missing out on a key fruit vitamin? "
745,Pain in lower back when running,"I started trying to get fit about 6 months ago.  I mostly bike (70 miles a week), but I sometimes mix it up with jogging (which I do using minimalist shoes; I used to not be able to run because of knee pain, but those shoes really seemed to take care of that).  I'm a bit overweight, but not horribly so -- I'm 5'11'' and 190 pounds.  No injuries that I know of.  Anyway, I went out for a jog this afternoon, and I had a weird pain.  It started immediately.  Every time my feet hit the ground, I felt my lower back start to tighten up (in a narrow band just above my buttocks, all the way across the back; if I press on the location, I feel what I assume are the tops of my hip bones).  It got tighter and tighter every time my feet hit the ground, and eventually it was so painful that I had to stop.  I made it maybe one block (0.1 miles) before I had to turn back.  If I do very light jumping in place, I get the same tightening and pain, but I don't feel anything from ordinary walking or from biking.  It is a dull and not a sharp pain, and I haven't felt any bulges or had the sensation of something ""giving out"".  Does anyone have any idea what is wrong?  Are there stretches I need to do or anything? "
746,will ripped abs be a no-show if my body fat % is increasing?,"So I'm a fit 21 y/o. I have good cardio ability (I can run 10K, swim 2.5k and cycle 150K)  I started going to the gym 1.5 months ago, my body fat % was measured at 11% before I began and just like the trainer said it would, it increased to 13%  I do a regular ab workout on my cardio days (along with squats, deadlifts, chin-ups and lunges on weight days)  My abs have a little definition but their not fully ripped. (I have a slight pinchable bulge at the naval)  Am I on the wrong road here? Will my abs be a no-show since my body-fat is increasing? Should I better my diet to stabilize or decrease it? "
747,"Are ""fast-twitch"" and ""slow-twitch"" muscles actual scientific terms? If so, are they useful for the strength trainer?","When I first started to strength train in high school, one of the first things I remember reading in the weight room was this giant chart that highlighted areas of so-called fast-twitch and slow-twitch muscle fibers in the body. Lots of ""the boys,"" that is, the friends that I trained with, took this apparent knowledge to heart, and for different looks each of us wanted to achieve, we designed different workouts based on whether they would fatigue our ""slow-twitch"" or ""fast-twitch"" muscles.  For example, those of us who wanted a lithe look of the runner did low-weight, high repetition workouts so that we might fatigue the ""slow-twitch muscles"", and those who wanted a more bulky, cut look of a sprinter performed more high-weight, short-repetition workouts to fatigue the ""fast-twitch"" muscles.* This information was particularly relevant for those few of my friends who wanted to try out for various positions on the football team, which as everyone knows weight on stamina, endurance, and power differently.  Unfortunately, the study of fitness and nutrition as a scientific discipline is replete with misinformation and pseudoscience, to the point that one can't really Google for even basic information without being afraid that one is being marketed to or upsold in some fashion.  Still, I distinctly remember reading later somewhere that either ""fast-twitch"" and ""slow-twitch"" muscles were pseudoscience or, at the very least, outdated terms, much in the same way ""alpha dog"" is an outdated term for those who study dominance hierarchies among wolves, but a term which still persists in the common parlance. Alas, I can't remember exactly, and lots of different websites in my search results seem to take ""fast-twitch"" and ""slow-twitch"" seriously.  So here are my canonical questions:     Are ""fast-twitch"" and ""slow-twitch"" actual scientific terms? If they were so, are they so now? If they are indeed scientific, does knowing about them help one design better workouts? E.g.,   Does one have a natural endowment or ratio of ""fast-twitch"" to ""slow-twitch""? Can it be determined practically? If not the above, is it possible to convert one type of muscle to another in some way? Do certain muscles contain more of one muscle fiber than other muscles? Is that relevant to designing workouts? Do members of certain athletic professions (sprinters, swimmers) possess different ratios of fast-twitch to slow-twitch than others?    (*) I am well aware that many strength trainers recommend high-weight, low repetition workouts regardless of which look one wants to achieve.  That is not what I'm asking.  I'm asking whether the rationale that we came up with was sound. "
748,"Quinoa: red or white, which is healthier?",What is the healthier quinoa (assuming they are different)?  What are the various health benefits of each? 
749,Should my running be aerobic or anaerobic?,"I'm running every other day, and I run pretty hard. I'm looking for the best way to build endurance so that I can run for longer without wearing out, but I'm also liking the amount of calories that I'm burning during my runs as well. Would it be more beneficial to slow down my pace to lower my heart rate, or should I continue to run hard? According to my miCoach Pacer, almost all of my running intervals are in the ""yellow"" zone.    At this level, breathing is difficult, and I can only say a few words, but there's no way I could carry on a conversation. I've been doing this for almost 4 full weeks, though, and I am definitely improving, but would I improve more if I slowed down (into the green zone) for my running intervals? "
750,What causes side stitches?,"From time to time during aerobic workouts such as running or heavy cycling, I get side stitches that force me to slow down my effort.   What causes side stitches?    I know that reducing your effort reduces the stitch, but is there something that you can do to prevent them from occuring in the first place?  And lastly I only ever seem to get them on one side (my right) and never on the other.  Is that typical of a stitch? "
751,Does the existence of trans fat invalidate years of research on saturated fats?,"If only relatively recently trans fats were discovered to be much worse for you then saturated fats, does that have implications on past research on saturated fats? Is that research now outdated? Can research that didn't control for trans fats still be said to be valid? I'm imagining in my mind these studies from way back when that compared two diets, diet A rich in saturated fats, and diet B lacking saturated fats. Because trans fats weren't controlled in the study, diet A would have varying levels of trans fats. The study concludes that diet B is healthier. But maybe its only healthier because of the trans fats in diet A?   Has more up to date research been done to determine whether diets rich in saturated fats but without trans fats are still to be avoided?  "
752,Does proper incline bench form require pinched shoulder blades?,"I know you're supposed to pinch your shoulder blades on flat bench - it feels proper.    It used to feel fine on incline as well but the twice in the past two weeks (attempting PRs) I've felt something just under my left shoulder blade ""pull"" as I'm pressing and result in some weird tingling throughout my left shoulder/arm and a bit of neck pain when I turn my head.  The first time it resulted in some weird residual pain in my shoulder area that would hurt only when I coughed.  That went away today, so I decided to try again but the same thing happened - pulled the same thing under my left shoulder blade, same weird sensation going down my arm, a bit of neck pain when I turn my head.  The weight is reasonable - I'm not straining myself too much and maintain steady form while pressing.  Do you pinch your blades on incline?  What could be causing this? "
753,Should I eat more calories when working out even though I'm trying to lose weight?,"For example, if I use one of these calculators that tells me how many calories to eat, if I put in that I am sedentary it tells me to eat (for example) 2000 calories. If I put in that I'm moderately active and work out 3 times a week it tells me to eat (f. ex.) 2300 calories.   For example, this calculator from the Health Weight Forum recommends almost twice as many calories for someone working out heavily than someone who is sedentary. And it recommends this for losing weight.  This doesn't make sense to me, if I go from being sedentary to becoming very active, surely I would want to eat around the same amount of calories so as to lose weight? Why do calorie recommendation calculators advise me to eat more calories when working out even if my intention is to lose weight? Why would I want to eat more?  And it seems to imply that it makes sense to exercise less and eat less.  "
754,Strength and conditioning for blood circulation,"Resources online primarily focus on cardio being the best way to improve blood flow. However, some resources also mention strength and conditioning for improved blood flow. I have noticed that pushups and similar exercises do get my heart pumping.  How good are strength and conditioning training compared to cardio to improve blood flow while I am not training? Is there any research on how much impact intensity of workout has on a persons blood circulation?  That is, how much better is one hour of brisk walking compared to twelve minutes of guerilla cardio training if my goal is to improve my overall blood circulation?  "
755,Meal Replacement Shakes - Why aren't they healthy to consume for all nutrition?,"In my research it seems properly made meal replacement shakes with fresh fruits and vegtables and balanced for proper nutrition are healthy as a possible replacement for one or two meals a day.   However from my perception there seems to be some consensus that consuming them all them time is not ideal and consuming them for every meal is bad. However, I am having trouble finding information on why.  Wouldn't a shake have almost all necessary nutrition? Is there something inherently bad with non-solid diets?  Is it because of the lack of nutrients that are usually only maintained from non-mixed ingredients like meats?  Is it healthy to continually consume meal replacement shakes over the course of the day vs. getting the recommended 6 meals a day? "
756,Toning/Cutting while doing Stronglifts(5x5),"I am a 19 year old male and trying to lose some fat (got a bit of love handles). I'm gonna guess I'm around 18-20% body fat.  I've been doing stronglifts for 2 months ish to get stronger, I'm at 255 squats etc (I weigh 205).  I've been eating the amount of food that I need to stay the same weight, around 2500 calories a day. Once in a while I eat mcdonalds or all you can eat sushi, etc.  If I cut my calories to 1800-2000 a day while continuing stronglifts, will I be able to lose some fat? How will it affect my lifting progress? If I wanted to lose weight fast (I hate dieting) - will it be a good idea to eat even less?  Thanks "
757,Intermittent Fasting Post Workout,"I have lost around 33 pounds using intermittent fasting (skipping breakfast by substituting BCAAs).  Since then, I have started lifting, first with Starting Strength and now with Texas Method, regaining about 11 pounds.  I am over 40 and am only training twice a week (Monday and Friday).    On workout days when I lift in the morning, I skip my IF, have protein throughout the day and allow myself extra carbs.  On the remaining days, I adhere to IF and go low carb (still trying to keep protein high).  This seems to be working well.  My question is what to do on the day after a workout?  I know protein is important the day of the workout.  Will IF the day after workout adversely affect recovery?  Looking for any recommendations from those folks both attempting to increase strength while staying lean on IF.  Thanks. "
758,What's the difference between calories and kcal,"What are the differences between Calories, calories, and kcals?  Why do we have different terms to describe the same concept?  In what cases is it useful to use one unit of measurement over the other? "
759,Does the order of exercising a specific muscle first in a split routine matters?,"Does the order of exercising a specific muscle first in a split routine matters? For instance, in a chest/back, shoulders/legs or biceps/triceps routine, does exercising a specific muscle first matter (like chest BEFORE back) or can they be alternated in the next workout since for example, chest and back train independent of each other? "
760,Isolating the lower and upper pecs?,"For the past six months I have been working on my pecs using seated cable fly and machine fly. With the seated cable fly I push downward slightly on the cables to isolate the pecs from the delts.  So far things have been very good, the pecs are growing nicely.    Is there such a thing as lower and upper pecs? If so, what are some ways to work the upper pecs without involving the delts and lats?    I know that the machine fly takes it partly there as it covers the pec entirely.  But is there something to isolate the upper pecs?  All the research I've done suggests there is no such thing as lower, middle and upper pecs.  Does anyone have any bodybuilding experience on this? "
761,Can I use ON Whey Protein and P90X Recovery Formula together?,I'm doing Body Beast. I was using P90X Recovery Formula after workout but it's doesn't have enough protein for me to reach my goals. So I've decided to use Whey protein too. What is the best time to use it? With P90X Recovery Formula after workout or any time during the day?  Supplements I use:   Pre-Workout: ON Pre-Workout Post-Workout: P90X Recovery Formula Post-Workout: ON Creatine Powder ???: ON Whey Protein  
762,Is its safe to stop between intervals on the treadmill?,"Usually when I run intervals on the treadmill I warm up for a few minutes and then set the machine to my desired speed and begin training. Between intervals I stop completely jumping off to the sides to rest while the machine is still running and then after my desired rest period I jump back on.  The other week while I was doing this, someone in the gym came over to tell me that what I was doing is very dangerous, because making sudden stop while your heart rate is up is unhealthy. Now I understand that what he is saying is mostly true as I know that at the end of a cardio workout, cooling down is advisable in order to bring the heart rate down slowly.  Why doesn't the same rule apply to football players? They only run for a few seconds at a time at full intensity bringing their heart rates very high only to come to a sudden stop at the end of the play. That was my logic when I was stopping suddenly for a few seconds to catch my breath in preparation for my next sprint. Is what I'm doing really dangerous or is it ok for me to continue running intervals in this manner? "
763,"Taking multivitamin tablets without workout , will it cause any problems ?","I was doing workout last year and was regularly taking multivitamins and whey protein. But now, I am resting after a bone fracture, So I am no regular to Gym. I am not taking meat and heavy foods now so I am starting to  feel  weak. So Started taking multivitamins (Anavite from Gaspari Nutrition) again.    My doubt is taking multivitamins without a regular exercise ? Is it good or bad ? Will it speed my recovery ? "
764,How do I perform a muscle-up?,Muscles-ups are an exercise where by we start of with a pull up and follow by a dip.  I have been trying to do that for the previous few months but am still unable to do it. I am able to do the pull-up but every time I want to change to dip I get stuck. Is there a way to train so that I can do that exercise?   Which muscle group is being use in doing muscle up?  
765,Are free stand squat holders safe for home use?,A lot of stores are selling free stand squat holders. It seems they could go off balance since they are not connected. They also do not supply a real safety system.  Are they safe to use? And so to what weight can you actually use them? Not considering the maximum weight described by the manufacturer but what is actually safe to use?  This question is related to home use where it really has to catch the weight after the exercise is done or on failure   
766,Vitamin B toxicity?,"I understand the B Vitamins are water-soluble, so it is more difficult to take too much -- you flush them out of your system (as opposed to fat-soluble vitamins, which can stay with you for a long time).  However, is it possible to take so many B vitamins that they start to become toxic?  What are the negative effects? "
767,"What are all the weightlifting plate/disc types, and what are their uses?","There's bumper plates, steel plates, calibrated plates, and so on. What other types are there, and what are each used/good for? Pros vs cons? "
768,Estimating burnt kcal from one type of activity when measured by heart rate and measurement assumes different activity?,"I have a certain watch that can be linked to a heart rate monitor. It then will give me the amount of calories based on the premise that I am running. However, obviously the watch can be used also for monitoring my heart rate during other activities, such as biking.  Given this setup:   does the calorie consumption only depend on the heart rate or also on the mode of movement? assuming it depends on the mode of movement, can I ""convert"" my calories that were calculated based on the assumption that I was running into those for biking? A rough estimate is sufficient as we're talking hundreds of kcal, so I can subtract a bit more to make a conservative estimate. can you please give the sources for your answers?!     TL;DR  There is or isn't a difference between running at 160 bpm for 10 minutes and biking at 160 bpm for 10 minutes? If there is, how to estimate from one mode of movement for another? "
769,Exercise advice for newbie,"I'm a 22 year old male currently employed as a Program Developer(sedentary work).I weigh 110Kg's and am 186cm's high. I started working out about last week. I normally do 30mins of cardio on bicycle or treadmill, followed by 30mins of weightlifting.   My Questions: Is it better to focus on one group of muscles each day of weightlifting?  Do you think I should do more cardio than 30mins, if I can hold it?(Time is currently not an issue, but seeing as I just started last week I felt really exhausted after 30mins)   What is a good set of reps and amount of sets for building muscles?  How often should I increase the weight I'm lifting?  What do you think is a reasonable weight I should achieve after 6 months considering I also lowered my caloric intake to the recommended 1.9k and using myfittnespall to help me track everything i eat?  Last of all I have to admit I'm currently hooked on diet coke, and as much as I know it's extremely unhealthy feel I couldn't do this without it. do you think it can also hinder my weight-loss?  3 months and 1 week EDIT:  I don't really know the protocol on this things but i really wanted to thank you all for your answers and comments.   As of today I have reached a Body-Weight of 98 KGs and most improtantly my muscle resistance and mass has clearly developed alot lowering my bf percentage to an estimated 20%(tape measurements).   Thank you once again for your guidance through this new stage of my life.  PS: I know it doesn't look like it but I'm the OP.  "
770,How to strengthen *very gently* your grip in order to safely perform chin-ups? Are wrist wraps good?,"I have recently started trying to do negative chin-ups in several occasions, but afterwards I feel a mild pain in both my left and right wrists. It is not the kind of ""healthy"" discomfort of sore muscles, but rather the kind of thing that, when ignored, eventually sets up as a tendonitis.  After a day or two it goes away, then I try again, and it comes back.  This means, not only I have to do negatives in order to gain strength to eventually perform chin-ups, but rather I have to strengthen my wrists first, in order to be able to do negatives...  So, I have two questions:  1) What exercises can I do to gradually and gently gain strength in my wrists?  2) Will the bodybuilding writs wraps help by pulling too? Why and how? Should I wear them always when attempting dumbbell lifting and calisthenics, or would that protect my wrists but also prevent them from becoming stronger?  I have seen this wonderful video of a man performing several chin-ups at age 89, so I am not going to give up (I am 41).  Remark: by wrist straps I mean something like that:   which (I think but it is only a guess) act by relieving some tension from the transverse carpal ligament during heavy lifting. Nothing to do with the straps used to assist the grip in heavy deadlifts. "
771,My leg pinches in to my hip when squatting,"I'm doing barbell squats as described in Starting Strength.  When I get to a certain depth, I feel my thigh bone (femur?) pinching up against the inside of my pelvis, and feel like I can't go any deeper.  Is my form wrong? Do I stop there? Or do I somehow go deeper?  Note that I didn't feel these before, and was going very deep.  But observers told me (correctly I believe) that my knees would go forward too much, or that my hips were going up and down, not back and out.  Fixing that (now my squat looks like right) has caused this pinch. "
772,Legspan requirements for different running styles?,"There are many factors contributing to the legspan and rarity of people achieve maximal legspan such as different splits. The legspan affects functional skills such different running styles so having an impact on different running styles and different forward movements such as galloping. It is hard to assess legspan such as dynamic legspan while the non-dynamic legspan is somewhat easier to assess. Yet even in non-dynamic legspan assesssment, things such as core twisting can make it hard to assess. So  How to asssess legspan in different running styles? Where can you find procedures for legspan asssessment particularly for runners? "
773,Why is it important to breathe whilst exercising?,"I just bought some push-up bars to give my wrists a break and was interested to see that the leaflet in it was keen to advise me that ""it is very important to breathe normally whilst exercising - do not hold your breath"".   Apart from the obvious, why is this good advice?  Does it affect the gain in muscle you get or is it just so you don't pass out?  "
774,Unplanned Achievement - Lost ~72.8 lbs (33 kg) But Was It The Correct Way Of Doing It? Not Exactly But Lessons Learned!,"Before reading further, I want to make the following disclaimer:     My casual experience of losing weight documented below is strictly   not for everyone and should not be treated as an advice until at least   commented by experts and claimed to not represent health risks.   I have a casual success story to tell you about how I lost weight unplanned and ask you if it was a correct way to do it. Why casual you ask? It's because I wasn't consciously planning to lose weight which seems to be controversial to what most people preach - ""People that have a goal will get there someday."" What about people who don't have goals but reach them?  Let me clarify that until age of 18, I was eating an unhealthy diet. I was eating mostly sandwiches and didn't like stewed food such as vegetables and I didn't eat soups at all. The bad thing was that I mostly was distracted by staring into computer during meal consumption, the activity known for being bad for digestion which caused acid reflux in me. Mostly after every meal I didn't feel it was enough and wanted something else, something different and more tasty which was snacks like chips, candies or chocolates.  My Success Story  A few months until then I quit eating snacks like chips, quit eating sugar stuff like chocolate and chocolate waffles, changed what i ate late evening to reduced amounts of fruits and vegetables, quit drinking very sweet apple juices,quit drinking poisonous and addictive substances like Coca Cola and Red Bull alike copycat products.  It all started 2 weeks before New Year and I subconsciously made myself a goal to clean/square away my flat so it will shine before New Year starts. Every day I was feeling energized getting up early and working my sweat/butt off until 3AM-5AM the next day often feeling exhausted and consuming maximum of one meal during whole day and sometimes not eating at all, but not forgetting to drink of course. I was feeling sometimes nauseous which was mostly reason I wasn't eating more than one meal or any at all. Let me add as well that I also did morning exercises including sit-ups, push-ups, raising/lowering legs while lying on bed, exercises with dumbbells and runs of a couple of miles on a non-flat elevated/lowered distance which I think put more strain on heart. Something was driving me and keeping me energized to do everything meticulously and perfectly. Finally all was brushed, cleaned, squared away in such a way that rented flat seemed in such condition that I just moved in i.e like a new.  Conclusion  Two years ago my weight was 253.5 lbs and I was diagnosed with fatty liver, had hypertension - in short I was under risk of several medical conditions and I had to do something about it. A year later my weight saw small improvement to 242.5 lbs as I started stabilizing my diet and in last year alone I went from 242.5 lbs to 205 lbs which according to BMI index was still above my healthy BMI of 85kg = 187.39 lbs.  Today my weight is ... drumroll please ... Within my healthy BMI - 82kg which is 180.77 lbs!  That's right ladies and gents, I did it! But I couldn't do it without changing my mindset and the following 5 character traits which some I was born with and some nurtured in myself in the course of my lifetime which are:   Goal Orientation (born with and nurtured further) Discipline (nurtured) Willpower (nurtured) Motivation (nurtured) Patience (born with and nurtured further)   There is a saying about once you start doing something, you become better at it. Same is true for fitness, because when I started, it was tough to perform exercises as easy as I perform them today. I couldn't do more than 1 full push-up compared to 13 full push-ups I do today. I coudn't walk and run 4 miles as easy as I walk and run them today.  How do I feel today? More energized, happier, optimistic and most importantly healthier than before ready to burn remainder of fat and get in optimal shape. Cholesterol levels reduced by twice, risks of medical conditions are eliminated, I think more clearly and there is a little memory improvement.  One thing is sure - losing weight is easier compared to maintaining weight when you need to maintain balance to stay within limits and be concerned of food you consume trying to not go ""offroad.""  Now I want to ask fitness coaches, bodybuilders and nutritionists:  Was the way I lost weight safe? What mistakes I made? What I should have done differently and what should I improve?  Appreciate your opinions and suggestions!  UPDATE July 20th, 2014: Hello people! In this world, nothing is exempt from cause and effect so let me update you on my fitness.  Over 2 and half years ago I started doing runs once or twice per day while weighing 253.5 lbs. I have been running in low quality running shoes and while it still had its sole in normal condition, I slowly felt as it gets more compressed over time until it became thin. The effect of this is that I have developed pain in my right knee running in low quality running shoes which were not absorbing shocks well. These days I no longer run because I am quite busy and after almost every long run I have aching knee. Sometimes short run can cause mild ache. I have learned lesson the hard way and I hope I will be able to improve my knee's condition. I would appreciate your input regarding this problem.  My weight is more or less 175 lbs which is within healthy range because in my opinion I have stabilized my metabolism. Did I just coin this ""metabolism stabilization"" thing? I think my body became less bearable for sugar consumption because the amount of sugar I could eat when was overweight, eating same amount now would make me feel nauseous and even throw up. For example I drank tea and coffee with 2 teaspoons but today only 0.5 teaspoon is enough. Today drinking morning coffee could make me satiated until noon.  Is Sugar Threshold For Headache Real?  Not long ago, my acquaintance from internet mentioned something about sugar consumption thershold and sugar withdrawal effects. So what have I learned about this and what happens if I overconsume sugar? First it starts with brainfog and then ends with headache lasting in the range of 1-3 days rarely turning into migraine where I lie suffering. I think this brings me to possible answer to question of why I was having many headaches in teenage years (some were due to impaired eyesight in a period when I didn't have glasses). Now that I think of my diet back then, it's crazy. I would not eat soups but sandwiches and after sandwiches would ear chocolate and chips after which I often drank Coca-Cola or sugar-stuffed juices. In fact, it was the only beverage I drank instead of mineral water because I hated it and was addicted to that poison. Food that looks good on the outside may be poison on the inside. Lesson learned.  Most of the time I drink tea, coffee and when summer comes, I buy juices but I never drink them as they are. Even if I tried, due to sugar (intolerance? / resistance?) my body developed I would feel nauseaus and probably develop headache. I always water juices down with mineral water and though I still drink mineral water, I don't drink daily recommended amount per day. People, what those bastards who are behind juice manufacturing doing is unacceptable!  Why Sometimes I Feel Tired And Lethargic?  I still have those moments when I feel slow, lazy and drowsy (""energy crash""?). At work, this really hits my productivity. You can even Google about this and find out that many people experience this. I think this has to do with amount of food I consume and it is recommended to eat 3/4 of meal since you will feel satiated after quarter and hour. In the morning though I wake up before 6AM and only drink coffee which lasts me until noon which is where I eat launch and then get drowsy and sleepy. Not good feeling and I will need to find out the solution though I think high-quality morning coffee with coconut oil could be the answer. Eating more frequently in small amounts could be the way too as I am not sure about coffee similar to ""bulletproof coffee"" that I drank. You can Google this if you are interested to learn more but the coffee I drank was past expiry date (yeah I know...) Arabica wholebeans coffee with added amount of grass-fed butter. After a while it caused hearburns so I stopped drinking it.  Sometimes I have food cravings and get to eat more until feeling ""energy crash"". I start from vegetables and end up with full stomach which is where I feel it is harder to move and want a nap. What is the reason people overeat? Those who are less busy and stay home more often than people who work their butt, get to overeat and ad weight. Usually this is when watching TV and feeling bored when commercial hits in. You go to grab a snack to to make it in time when show is back on. Similar with computer being bored when surfing internet or waiting videogame level to load. All of this leads to uncontrolled food consumption and obesity. Personally I try to not eat when watching TV or using computer because I get to lose focus and enjoy food leading me to compensate later.  Try to keep yourself busy in order to forget about snacks and start eating healthy and in time. When you are hungry, you will eat everything and forget about snacks.  How I Maintained Shape When I Worked at The Office  I was working at the office full-time in last 6 months and I had to stay productive. I did not quite understand why people working at the office complained about their job because I assumed physical work is the the one to complain about but now I do. In my case sitting chained to computer for 9 hours in my case was not as I thought it to be, especially sitting through a few hours after lunch break. I was fighting myself to not falling asleep and I was lethargic and drowsy. Eventually I have found how to stay in optimal shape, retaining mental clarity and creativity (my job requred that) in the morning and more or less after lunch time.  In the morning I was waking up  15 minutes earlier and doing simple excercises and excercises with dumbbells if I had time. I drank a glass of lemon citric acid, small bottle of probiotic yogurt and black arabica grinded coffee for the road. I didn't eat until 1PM and felt good. Sometimes I was forgetting about lunch for a couple of hours more until I felt I could no longer think and had feeling of fainting.  There were days where I came to work and drank instant coffee with milk and half teaspoon of sugar and was satiated until 5PM without anything else whatsoever! I guess instant coffee (with its toxins) works well for me...  For lunch break while it wasn't good solution, I reduced home meal from full portion to 3/4 and sometimes 1/2. After that I haven't eaten until 7PM-8PM and that's when I came home. I tried to eat salads as often as I could and then gone to sleep around 10PM but still I was still tempted sometimes to eat carbs.  Nightly Meals Should Be Eaten At Least 2 Hours Before Bed  I still eat late but not quite as often as before. I have noticed that when I eat something easy as salad and drink tea, I end up waking up with better mood and feel easy and eneretic. I also wake up hungry and eat healthy breakfast. Whereas eating sandwich, meat, chocolate even 2 hours before bed makes me feel sleepy in the morning, reluctant to eat with impaired energy.  When I want to eat 10 minutes before bed I ask myself - ""Why would I eat now if I am going to sleep just to enjoy food and feeling not good in the morning?""  Sometimes this works but if it is not, I eat vegetables like carrots and fruits like apple and orange as this works okay for me.  What I have Noticed Happens when ""Coming off of Tracks""  Here I refer to excessive carbs and sugar consumption which sometimes happens to me and results in bigger layer of visceral fat on belly which I am able to observe a day after when doing morning push-ups. I was actually see more of belly's fat hanging the day after ""abusing carbs and sugar"" and almost flat belly when not consuming carbs and sugar for several days. Can some of you relate to this or I am imagining things?  How I Am Able to Supress My Appetite for Half Day   Coffee - like mentioned above, if I drink instant coffee with milk and at least 1 teaspoon of sugar, I can stay satiated until evening. What really boosts the effects is added teaspoon of cocont oil and thinking of food would make me feel nauseus. I don't do this frequently because this method while works, can probably be unhealthy for those with stomach problems. Working out - I don't want to eat for many hours after intensive 1 hour workout. If at some point I get tempted to eat carbs and sugar, I would do intensive workout again but it doesn't have to be 1 hour long anyway. I guess when body actively catabolizes and later afterburns, food is the least I can think about?   As I was on my weight loss path, I think slow conditioning of subconscience played a big part. Do one thing dozen of times until you forget about it and your subconscience starts doing it or you could just end up being OCD about it. If latter is the case, let's hope it is something healthy for your body.  That's all from me now. I hope you enjoyed reading it and if you have anything to add, feel free to do so. Let's talk. "
775,"Snack time, protein or carbs?","I have finally come back into meal prep mode, and before I never actually gave thought of the order of my snacks or if it matters at all, I usually have a protein or carb snack with some green tea. The time I'm aiming for is 11am for first snack and 5pm for second snack. But I was wondering, does it matter if I eat the protein snack first? or should I eat the carb one first? I go to the gym around 7pm, if that helps to give some insight. Other than my whey protein I haven't found a good substitute to consider switching the protein snack options. So any suggestions will be greatly appreciated as well.  "
776,Why are my knees hurting after a treadmill run?,"I am trying to get back in shape and started running.  After a few runs (treadmill at the gym) both my knees are really hurting.     Is this due to a lack of stretching? Is this overcompensating for weakness in other muscles ?    What would i be doing that would make my knees hurt.  I have run in the past and never had this specific pain.  Also, is there any recommendation to heal from this.  I have stopped running for 3 days and my knees still hurt even when walking or going up stairs, etc.  If it is weakness in other leg muscles I would appreciate any exercise suggestions "
777,Caffeine and creatine,"I have read from a number of online sources that creatine isn't as effective when taken with caffeine.  I also read that if you space out the caffeine consumption from the creatine consumption, it may be OK.  My question is: is it OK to take caffeine and creatine on the same day, as long as we have some gap between the two? If so, what's a safe gap?  UPDATE: Here's one of the sources I remember I read about it - [website]"
778,Dumbbell Shoulder Press: Natural vs the usual grip,"What is the difference? Does it target different muscles?  It seems to me a bit more natural for my shoulders if I change the usual grip (open grip with palms out) and do a natural grip in my shoulder press. It is the ""classic"" picture I had in mind about that exercise, specially when alternating hands:    (form the blog of Joe Dowdell)  It is a completely subjective appreciation, but this and the Arnold version, seem both easier and less prone to annoying tiny cracking noises, to my computer rounded shoulders (in which I am already working with stretches, and with the presence of reverse dumbbell flies in my workouts, but that is another question)    Remark  This is what I call the ""usual"" grip (open grip with palms out)    A third option is called Arnold Press, invented by the Governator in his early years, where your palms rotate during the movement, from inwards at the bottom of the movement, to forward at the top:   "
779,How to maintain muscle during breaks from training?,"I m 25 years old and have been going to the gym for the past 3 years. Recently, I took 10 days off due to illness and noticed that I lost muscle. This happens whenever I take a break from the gym.  Why did this happen? How can I avoid this muscle loss during breaks in training? "
780,Stretching muscles while they are engaged,"I've heard a theory that it is better to stretch muscles while they are (lightly?) engaged. The reason was said to be that muscle engagement will cause the muscles themselves, rather than the tendons, to stretch.  I've not been able to find any information about this online. Does someone have more information which supports or refutes this theory?  "
781,Why do I see better results when taking it easy?,"So I've been trying to tone my body for almost a year now. Through most of the year, I've been going very intensive with my workouts and although I was seeing results, they weren't as good as I expected them to be. Because of that, I just gave up and didn't bother with it anymore. A few months later, I got at it again, doing workouts at 25-50 reps each. Its only been a month and I'm seeing much better results. I'm on the exact same diet i was on before. Nothing changed apart from the workout reps...  I thought the more extensive your workouts are the quicker you see better results, right?  So am I wrong - Is it actually better to take it slowly? "
782,What constitutes a low carb diet?,"What constitutes a low carb diet?   I've been trying to limit daily intake of of carbohydrates in my diet to under 100g. Would limiting it even lower improve results in terms of weight loss?  Also, how many grams of carbohydrates does a normal male and female take as recommended by USDA guidelines? "
783,Can one be on a ketogenic diet and not go to the gym?,"I was researching the ketogenic diet and as I understand it, it's basically the same as Atkins except that it allows for a high fat intake. Also, under a ketogenic diet you have days where you 'carb up' to replenish your system.  Is it bad to be on a ketogenic diet when you're not going to the gym? Does the high fat intake of this diet have a bad effect if you're not working your muscles? Is it better to be on an Atkins diet if you have a sedentary lifestyle? "
784,Are you prone to injury directly after weight lifting?,"I'm following the Starting Strength program, and I find that I'm fine the next day, as long as I warm up each lift as he recommends.  But, I find that immediately after lifting, even though I'm not in pain, simple daily lifts, like picking up a child or reaching in to buckle a car seat, can be very painful.  And, if I do it anyway, I really do get hurt.  (It's mainly lifts that involve turning.)  This vulnerability goes away after a number of hours.  Does anyone else experience this? What causes it? How should I prevent it? "
785,Consuming Spirulina with Wheat Grass,"I maintain a pretty healthy life style and I exercise 6 days a week as follows:  I run at least 3 days every week totaling to 20Kms.  And, on other days I do PullUps,Push UPs, sun salutes and light weights.  I have been regularly drinking Wheat Grass powder with water for the last 4-6 months on an empty stomach early in morning, and, I have seen positive effect in my digestion and energy levels. I recently also read about the benefits of Spirulina and I am planning to get it in tablet form. I am a vegetarian.  But, here are my concerns...  Is it advisable to consume both of them together (Spirulina &amp; Wheat Grass) ?  Or, should I alternate between both of them? For example, for some length of time, consume one of them and then switch to another and keep on alternating between both of them?  Or, can I consume both of them during different periods of days?  I am worried if consuming both of them together can have any negative effects . "
786,What's the highest heart rate that I can exercise and still be very fresh for work?,"Walking and cycling to work can be healthy and can save money. Exercise is even known to improve productivity. Since tiredness affects job performance especially if it's a physical job, it's very important to save our energy. We'll need it for 8 hours.  How can we walk or cycle to work without becoming tired?  The commute can range between 30 and 60 minutes. What's the highest heart rate that we can use and not get tired? If we use zone 1 on the way to work, is it safe for our performance? They say it's so easy that you felt like you didn't ride your bike. If we use the 180 minus age heart rate on the way home, would we be fully recovered by the next morning for work?  If more time is needed for recovery, an alternative might be to exercise heavily only after work on Fridays, and Saturdays.  I'm asking this question because my job is manual labour and friends are concerned that when I bike to work, I get too tired. It requires core strength. "
787,Build muscle in Arms,"I don't see any muscle at all in my arms ; I'm 98KG , with BMI of 28.  Is it possible to get some improvement using dumbbells only at home ?  It is a mystery to me how people build their muscles , is there any technique to follow ? Or is not possible for Obese people ? "
788,How do I strengthen my false grip to do a muscle-up?,"I have been learning to do muscle up for past few week and still could not do one.  For the past few weeks I have been using my legs to try and kick myself up, but still could not do a muscle up.   I have found that my false grip is weak and could not do a proper pull-up using false grip.  Should I continue to train using my leg or should I train on my false grip first?  How do I strengthen my false grip? Will hanging on the pull up bar using false grip help? "
789,"Increasing prevalence of Allergies and Poly-sensitivity in Athletes, why?","This publication claims increasing prevalence of allergies in elite athletes and ""[o]ver 80% of allergic [elite] athletes are poly-sensitized"". Yet this is not just an issue of elite athletes, exercise-induced (EI) allergic symptoms can also occur in recretional atheletes.   Why does there exist increasing prevalence of allergies and poly-sensitivity in athletes? How do recretional atheletes compare to elite atheletes? "
790,"How can I get more ""toned""?","Some background: I'm 6'1 and weigh approximately 152 lbs.  I want to be toned (muscular and cut). Not big, but I want my muscles to be showing even when I don't flex. I especially want a six pack.  Now, I know this takes time and hard work. I also know I need to have a good diet. So here's what I do (and have been doing for the past few weeks):  Eating Habits:  Breakfast: I have a chicken cutlet (I hate eggs) with greek yogurt and a glass (or two) of milk.  Lunch: Mon-Fri A buffalo chicken (boars head, sliced, from Publix deli) sandwich on italian bread, a banana, and an apple. On the weekends, my lunch varies.  Dinner: Varies. About two-three nights a week I'll have two Bubba burgers for the protein (26g per burger). Maybe once or twice a week I also have frozen pizza (I think that's the worst that I eat). Tonight I'm having tacos, last night I had spaghetti. Any recommendations?  Besides milk, I almost exclusively drink water. I never drink soda. I don't smoke. On the nights when I go to the gym, I have a protein shake with whey protein. I typically have it with ice cream, frozen strawberries (sometimes raspberries added) and orange juice.  Cardio:  I'm jogging three times a week, following this plan, to be specific. After I get to two miles, I'll be doing that three times a week, and I'll probably move it up to three miles when I can. I'm doing the cardio to help lose body fat so my six pack will show when I have enough muscle in my abs.  Strength:  I go to the gym on the days in-between my jogging. For example, Monday I'll jog, Tuesday I go to the gym, wed jog, thurs gym. But I only go to the gym twice a week. I workout only on the machines, but I want to start doing deadlifts for their great all around workout, as well as bench presses and squats.  I also work my abs every other day, doing this workout, although I can't do 4 sets yet, my max is 3.  So my main goal is a six pack, that's what I want the most. But I also want to be toned. If I keep doing this will I achieve my goals? Do I need to change some of my habits? What do you think? Any recommendations or critiques are most welcomed. Thanks. "
791,What is the difference between the diet and workout regimes of lingerie/underwear models and fitness enthusiasts/marathon runners?,"I was curious as to what the difference was regarding the diet and workout regimes of underwear models compared to say marathon runners and fitness enthusiasts.   Surely they both monitor nutrition to maximise fat loss etc, but what part of their diet and regime causes the difference in body shape?   Which would be best to obtain an 'underwear'-type body as opposed to an athletic runner? "
792,How to train arms for being the head in lion dancing?,"Lion dancing is a tradition in Chinese culture that I've decided to learn. I've found that my forearms aren't quite strong enough to create the effect of the lion shaking its head. I'm right-handed, so the thumb and forefinger on my left hand holds the bar while the other three fingers hold the mouth closed/let it fall open. My right hand holds the other bar, both of which are diagonal, with my palm facing me. There are various angles that I have to hold the head in, such as diagonally above me to the front, then bending the left and right arms respectively (when one arm is bent the other is thrust forward abruptly and straightened). I don't always have access to the head to practice with; what muscles should I train and how should I train them in order to be able to control the head better? Please note that I am a teen so I might not be able to do certain exercises that adults can.    The picture attached shows how the head is held up. It's from the NY Times. "
793,"Protein ,Fat and carbs for vegetarian-obese","I'm obese . Goal is to lose fat .  What are the sources of protein for vegetarian ?  I'm currently using Quorn product but range is limited .   How about Fat and Carbs , do both need to low ? "
794,Unhealthy Weight Loss,"I'm an 18 year old male, who, although not unhealthy weight (originally 182 lbs) saw that too much of was in fat. Also for the past two years or so I have been doing crunches fairly regularly, and thought that reducing my overall fat might result in a nice six pack or something like it.  So now, jump to about a week ago, I got serious about this and started to increase my running (from a few miles a couple days a week to daily at 4 miles) and increase my ab workout slightly. Most radically though, I restructured my diet a lot. Before I would eats lots of relatively healthy food (pasta, yogurt, salmon, whole grain bread), and eat it till I was stuffed. Now I just eat a sorta predetermined small increment of food (usually based around salmon, yogurt, or eggs with some carbs/veggies) at each meal time, and outside of that I snack on vegetables and some fruits.  So with this strategy for about a week, it seems I have lost 7 pounds, with a fairly constant rate of about one pound each day (weighing myself each morning). I don't have a particular weight goal, just an overall reduction in body fat (which I don't have a direct way of measuring except looking down at my stomach :P) I don't think much of it is water weight (I always pee clear!)  So I suppose my primary question is how unhealthy is that sort of weight loss? It seems looking around most sources quote around 5 pounds a month as healthy... My primary worry is that loosing too much means that more of the loss is coming from muscle mass. I don't want to sacrifice all the work I've put in on my abs! Or will the fact that much of my diet is protein (~50%) protect my muscles somewhat? Other than that, so far, I feel great and have more energy than I have had in a while! "
795,Is it normal when starting squats to not have flexible enough ankles?,"I've read a lot lately that if I want to build a lot of strength and start thinking seriously about putting on some size that I should use squats as a core workout. I'm only 65kg (143 pounds) and have never really done any weight training. I do however use my boxing bag every night for about half an hour and do a handful of exercises using my own body weight such as pushups / handstands / plenty of core work.  I've given squats a go but I am having two problems:   Balance - this is probably due to point two, but maybe worth its own mention. It seems as though my ankles don't bend forward enough to squat down as far as I need to.   To help with the balance issue I have been using dumbbells in each hand (I find this significantly easier than a barbell on my shoulders). As for the latter issue though, I'm not sure if this is quite common and I should try stretching my ankles a few times a day until they bend forward further or if I'm doing something completely wrong.  Did anyone else have this problem when starting out? How should I take care of it? "
796,What is the most natural form of Vitamin D supplementation?,"I'd like to take cod liver oil or something similar to boost my vitamin D levels (which are low). I want something totally natural. Is there any way to take cod liver oil without feeling the reported awful taste of it ? If not, what other alternatives are there ? "
797,Am i on the right track for muscle up?,"I have started training to do muscle up yesterday. It is understandable if my shoudle or wrist get pain when i training to do it. But my elbow pain too. Is it ok?  For my dips i could go all the way below my chest. But for my pull up i have difficulty doing it with the false grip. So i use my leg to kick myself up as being told on the website.  [website]Using my leg to kick myself up i am able to get my chest over the pull up bar. But when i tried changing my position from my pull up position to the dips position, i can feel a sharp pain in my elbow. Is it okay to have that sharp pain? Because of that sharp pain i failed all my attempt in trying to get a muscle up done.  "

799,What is the best time of the day for High Intensity Interval Training (HIIT)?,"I have heard a lot about benefits of HIIT; however, nobody seems to address when is the best time for such activities. I got this question when watching ""The secret life of your body clock"" (BBC Horizon 2009). I intend to do HIIT in the early morning to kick start my metabolism and also to have a boost of endorphins for my day. However, the BBC documentary suggests that the best time for exercise in general is afternoon and it might not be safe to exercise heavily in the morning!  Do you know of any scientific study addressing this issue? If not, what is your personal opinion (i.e. would you do HIIT in the morning)? "
800,How to get my face (mouth to be precise) out of the water for breathing while doing a breast stroke?,"Currently I am a beginner and trying to learn breast stroke(some say it is the easiest of all strokes). I am fine with the leg movement in this. However,after maybe one or two leg strokes, I can't bring my face (mouth to be precise) out of the water surface to take a breath. I see people around using their hands and come up in a very relaxed way but for some reason I am unable to do so. How to get my face out (and in a relaxed way) ? Is it only tilting the neck or do we use our back to stretch or is it the hands that help to come up?  "
801,What is the benefit of eating excess calories when strength training?,"Is there a benefit to eating excess calories while strength training? Programs like Starting Strength suggest that a novice should be eating many calories in excess of what is needed, and that in the first few months, one may actually gain some additional body fat (if one is starting slim).  Is the benefit to this only to avoid trying to fine-tune the calorie intake to be right on the line of what is needed for muscle growth? To make sure you're on the excess side of the calorie balance so that strength gains are not affected?  Or is there an additional benefit to over-fueling yourself during this initial phase of strength training? "
802,Do obese and unfit people tend to be stronger than slender people who train?,"Yes I know the question in the title seems weird... As weird as what I recently read:     I used to weigh more than 300 pounds. I smoked like a house on fire, I   drank like a blues guitarist, I ate whatever I wanted whenever I   wanted, and I never, ever exercised.      In 2003 I lost more than half my body weight. In 2007 I started a   wildly successful personal training career. Today I’m fit enough to   run (though I usually choose not to), and thin enough to comfortably   wiggle my butt into size 6 jeans (though I usually wear super-stretchy   workout clothes).      (…)      Being fat gave me natural physical strength. As a thin person, I have   to go out of my way to be strong. Despite daily strength training I’m   nowhere near as powerful as I used to be. Once upon a time I could   confidently lift a couch into and out of a moving truck (a U-Haul, not   a truck in motion — being fat never did give me super powers). Today,   I labor under the weight of heavy things. I miss the natural, organic   strength that I used to take for granted, the sheer power born of   moving under the weight of my own fat day after day.   Kelly Coffey, 5 Things I Miss About Weighing More Than 300 Pounds  Really? A thin person, even if they train for strength, can be no stronger than a severely obese person who never exercises?  This seems almost outrageous... Yet, granted, this would explain why some athletes in strength disciplines (weightlifting, hammer throw, wrestling, etc) are not only muscular, but also fat?  Is being fat really close to a prerequisite of being strong?? "
803,My back goes horizontal (forward) when squatting,"When squatting, my back is too horizontal (forward).  The bar goes forward of my toes.  What should I do to correct this?  Is it due to not keeping my lumbar tight enough?  Also: I haven't checked this, but it feels that when the bar is heavier this is less of a problem - as if the bar is pushing itself down where it needs to be.  How should I handle this? "
804,"No matter how hard I try, I just can't lift my back up in sit-ups","No matter how hard I try, I just can't lift my back up in sit-ups, yet I have many friends way less fit than me who can do it just fine.? How do I do it? "
805,What should I look for in a Starting Strength coach?,"What should I look for in a coach? How do I find a good one?  My goal is an occasional check up to help me with my form - price prevents regular sessions.  I'm considering finding one of the Starting Strength coaches - the ones certified by the authors of Starting Strength. What's been your experience with them?   Have they helped you significantly? Besides knowing the material, are they able to coach? That is, teach and advise so you can do it too? Where do they do it? If you're not a member of their gym, can they do it in their own facility?   Overall, has it been a worthwhile investment? "
806,How do I use bumper plates?,"In videos, I see people dropping the weights after power cleans.  I tried it at the gym.  It was horribly loud and the cap of the barbell popped off.  I hear I should be using bumper plates.  How do I use bumper plates (assuming I had them)?  Do I mix them in with the hard steel plates, or do I completely replace the hard steel with bumpers? "
807,Protein intake during workout break,"How does protein consumption affect muscle maintenance when not working out?   The DRI (Dietary Reference Intake) is 0.8 grams of protein per kilogram for the average sedentary men, and bodybuilders usually aim for 2.2 grams per kilogram.   What is an adequate middle ground for temporary sedentary bodybuilders?  "
808,What exercise would get heart pumping fast very quickly?,"Is there an exercise that could get your heart rate up to around 90% of max in 1-2 minutes? Or if not, or if that's not safe... what's the fastest most efficient safe way to get your heart pumping near the top of its range?  For example, just running in place won't do it. Jumping jacks won't do it. Both those will only get the heart rate up some, but not up high quickly. "
809,Is the wheel important in a sling trainer?,"I'm considering getting myself a sling trainer, after I was able to try one at a gym.  I found one major difference between cheap ones, and expensive ones (as the one on the gym), which is the wheel, which makes the string between the handles move really easy I guess.  Here is one without wheel: (Product)  And here one with wheel: (Product)  I'm thinking, the wheel is important and in order to get the full effect of a sling trainer I should get one with wheel, but before I put the order I'd like to get some input from some more experienced people.

810,Weighlifting shoes for a beginner,"I'm getting into strength training, following the Starting Strength program, and they advise strongly to buy some weightlifting shoes.  (Currently, I'm using some tough hiking sneakers, and don't feel any problems.)  What's a good shoe for a beginner?  My needs:   I want to stay on a budget (ideally &lt; $50, but, if impossible, I might pay more) Good protection, stability, and traction I'm not (yet?) lifting very heavy weights (still under body weight) I do a warm up of treadmill, eliptical, and jumping jacks - I need to be able to do that in the same shoes Would be great if the shoes could be used for jogging too, but, if that's not possible, I'll forgo it   UPDATE: Am I better off waiting a month or two and buying a $100+ shoe, or buying a cheaper one now and sticking with it?  Also: Can I do my warm up in a standard weight lifting (not cross fit) shoe? It's only 5-10 minutes. "
811,How long to wait between reps?,"How long can I wait between reps before I can't count the rep?  This isn't specific to deadlifts, but when I've watched lifters deadlift, they start the next rep immediately after. When I deadlift, after a couple reps I take a longer break (2-3 seconds). Should I count these reps?  Should I start the next rep immediately after the previous one, or can I take a short break?    I am doing the SL 5x5 program. "
812,Sub 1:30 Half Marathon in 36 Weeks,"I'll try to keep this as short as possible but if this exceeds the limit then please bear with me.  I'm 29 y/o Indian male and I was a serious (if not professional) body builder when I was younger. I started bodybuilding when I was 17 and pursued it for 4 years. Then I got a shoulder injury and simultaneously life got more demanding and I couldn't return to the sport. In next 4 plus years I put on a lot of weight and reached 100 KG (220 lbs) i.e. 32 KG (70 lbs) extra from my base weight when I was in sport. Oh and yes I'm not very tall. I'm 5'9''  I turned 25 and decided it was enough and hit the gym back. For the first time in my life I decided to run (which I thought was running) on treadmill for quicker results. Let's cut it short and let me tell you that I couldn't stop running since then. I quit the gym in next 7-8 months to do more serious running and joined a track.  I ran my first half marathon (1:58 hrs) in 10 months from the starting point. Second half (Hill Course- 2:10 hrs) in another 2 months and my first full in another 3 months and there I failed miserably (5:35 hrs)  By the time I ran my 1st full I was 30 KG (66 lbs) down and looked good. I now know that I transitioned from a fat lazy boy to a half marathoner and then to a full marathoner a little quick and my body couldn't handle the stress. I didn't stop there and ran 1 half and 1 full in next 4 months and my second full again went pathetic. I finished 4:40 hrs.  I went through injuries and bad races but I didn't stop. By June 2014, I finished 9 half and 2 full marathons and maintained my weight (plus minus 3 KG). Till then my HM PR was 1:53 hrs and now I wanted to improve. I added yoga and body weight exercises in my routine and improved myself significantly and lost some more inches too. I ran a 10 KM PR (45:40 mins) and a 5:44 min mile in practice. My 1 KM best is 3:36 mins and 14+ sec for 100 meters. I set all these PRs prior to the half marathon I was training for in Nov 2014.  I did all the fartleks, repetition work, speed work, long runs and drills and finished the half marathon in 1:43:10 hrs. Though I was expecting sub 1:40 but I was happy. This was the beginning of Nov 2014 and continued my training for a full marathon in Mid Jan 2015.  I did everything what the plan said. Ran high mileage weeks, did repetitions and speed works and everything the plan asked. I did the taper and carb loading too. During this training I ran two 20 milers. Each under 3:20 hrs very comfortably. Every test said I'm fit enough to run a sub 4 hour marathon. I did Yasso 800 workout and comfortably ran 10 rep of 800 in 3:20 mins with 2:30 min recovery between each rep.  There I must mention that I was training in North India and the temperature during Dec and Jan was below 10 Deg C in mornings. The race was in South and the temp on the race day was 19 Deg C.  After putting all the efforts in training I got drained on 3rd km and felt like quitting. I managed through half way and did 21 km in 1:48 hrs and the pace was very comfortable for me. Then I felt like I'm getting slow. This might be the marathon wall but if it was so then it came a lot too early. I started dragging and again finished with a miserable timing. I finished 5:10 hrs.  So where did it go wrong? Should I not go for fullers and stay happy with the half marathons? Even if someone suggests that, I wont take that advice haha! I want to run full marathons and qualify for Boston in near future. I know it'll take time but I'm ready to train.  For the time being I'm planning to cut on the junk races and train for a considerably fast half marathon for myself which will probably fall in the 1st week of November. I effectively have 9 months for this race. I want to run a sub 1:30 race. All the plans I see online are 16 to 18 weeks long but I've around 36 weeks.  I'm looking for some advice on how I should proceed with the training. I would also like to get a proper strength and flexibility training plan. My arms and legs are toned but I still have some extra inches around my waist. You know everybody loves six packs and I'm no exception :P  Thanks Parth "
813,Weight lifting and dental care,Are there any effects when it comes to weight lifting in our dental or teeth? Does lifting heavy will cause toothache? 
814,What should be the best plan for me to lose fat and gain muscle,"3 months ago I joined a gym. I am following a diet and doing mostly cardio workouts.  To date I have lost 5-6kg (I weighed 85kg before I started).  I have a couple of questions:   Should I continue with my current plan? I need to gain muscle, and I'm taking whey protein to help. What else can I do? Should I first focus on losing weight and then gaining muscle, gaining muscle and then losing weight, or both at the same time?  "
815,What's a deadlift supposed to feel like?,"I did my first ""real"" deadlift today, and, it's a very different feeling.  Unlike a squat or a bench, where I clearly feel myself pushing against something, when I deadlifted (135 lbs, about what I'm squatting), I just kind of stood up.  When I was done, I was sweating and exhausted, but I didn't feel the push-higher-higher I do when doing other lifts.  Am I doing it right? What is a deadlift supposed to feel like? "
816,Is sitting all day in anyway related to butt size?,"I'm a programmer and I sit by the computer almost all day long, some days literally all day, and I heard that sitting all day is one reason why someone's butt can get bigger is that true? and if yes, what is the science behind it?  "
817,Are Dumbbell Bent-Over Rows alone enough pull to counteract Push-Ups?,"For reasons explained in other posts and not relevant here, I am only doing now Push-Ups and Dumbbell Bent-Over Row (and Air Squats).  For the rows I use a nearly empty dumbbell for the moment. That is far from the ideal push-pull equilibrium. Relative to that, push-ups are a strong exercise: Playing a bit with a scale at home, I reached the conclusion that I was lifting 77% of my body weight at the bottom position of each push-up, and around 65% for an easy version with knees on the floor.  Therefore my question: can that be a problem for my shoulders? Which load should I aim for in the rows? Should I keep the pushups under a minimum? I don't want the next injury to be caused by muscular imbalance... "
818,Easy gain for untrained muscles?,"It is often said that it is easy to train untrained muscles.  How easy?  If you train strength, how does what you need to do to keep progressing change over time?  Examples: (Can a beginner progress strengthwise training in these ways)   Just training lighter, compared to max - (Not so interesting :-). Elliptical Trainer? (Perhaps in an interval mode where I use some body parts quite hard in periods). More reps/set and/or fewer sets?  (Compared to a normal strength program).  For example  one set of 20-30 reps of each exercise.   My mental image of this is that as we train it is getting more difficult to stress the muscles enough to progress, so you need more sets, more load, more sophistication.  (I am interested in real mass and strength gain  - Not particular to the exercise I am doing. "
819,What indications are there that a muscular adaptation has been triggered?,"There is plenty of discussion around optimal sets/reps for various types of adaptations to be triggered.  If someone is interested only in maintenance, or a minimal workout, they might want to know what is the minimum amount of work needed to trigger an adaptation.  About this amount, I'm wondering is there a physical sign that guarantees it has occurred?  For example, suppose I load up 70% of my 1RM and start doing reps, and will do only set until one of the following occur.   muscle pump muscle burn shaking / instability during a rep inability to perform another rep   Are any of those an indicator that I have achieved a minimal level of work to maintain muscle or possibly grow more? "
820,Weight loss/gain around rib cage (women),"I bought my wedding dress back in December and it fit perfectly. I have been away for 4 months for a ski season and have come home to find my dress is too small around my rib cage and won't do up. Their is nothing the tailor can do, so basically I need to lose it or I won't have a dress to wear. Therefore I need to to lose 2 inches around my rib cage in 5 weeks!   My other half has suggested low intensity exercise for long ish periods of time, which I agree is a good plan. I'm currently doing about 1-1.5 hours a day, which is consisting of 50% step-ups and 50% rowing.   I'm worried that rowing may have the opposite effect, in that I'm concerned that it's not fat around my ribs which is the problem but muscle gain from 4 months skiing and now rowing 4 times a week. My other half completely disagrees as he says it's not possible for women to gain muscle mass due to our hormones, so he thinks rowing is fine. Note that he has trained as a personal trainer, although does not work in this field.  I have put on some weight whilst away (1.5kg) and some of that is fat. However  I'm struggling to see how I can have gained 2 inches around my rib cage (which does not seem fat at all) when I have gained so little weight?   Any advice would be very gratefully received!   Should I stick to rowing or would I be better off with exercises which don't involve using my back muscles?  "
821,Difference caused by grip width on bench press,"Background  I've been fooling around with some variation in grip width on the bench press lately.  I've had a trainer help me find my ""ideal"" width, which I use most of the time. I.e. the width where my forearm stays as perpendicular as possible to the floor for most of the lift, while neither flaring nor tucking the elbows.  In these cases, my form looks like this. (Not me depicted, just an example.)    But I some times like to use a slighly more narrow grip - about a palm-width in on each hand. Just outside the shoulders. It looks something like this:    Question  What are the implications as far as muscle group intensities? Does it fill the role of if your muscle X is weak, do more of this for any particular muscle group?  This question is similar to, but not a duplicate of, Bench press grip width?, as I am not looking to discover the optimal width, but simply clarify benefits/drawbacks of a slightly narrower-than-normal width. "
822,Why is it easier to lift weight using a belt?,"As question states, I can life a lot more on deadlift and squat by using a belt to brace against, why? Is it cheating?  "
823,5:2 Intermittent Fasting with daily exercise,"I cycle to work weekdays - approximately 10 miles per day. I also do resistance training. For intermittent fasting such as 5:2, on calorie restricted days a common energy intake limit of 600 calories. As I am 6'6""/2m tall and 220lb/100kg I will burn more energy on the commute than the 600 calories I will consume each fasting day.   Should I modify the calorie limit to take account of that? Is anybody aware of research that suggests that the metabolic benefits of 5:2 intermittent fasting is affected by daily exercise? Also, are there any health reasons for a young, fit man not to do a 5:2 intermittent fast?  As an aside, I don't care about 5:2 intermittent fasting for weight control, gains or losing fat. The attraction is that research suggests effects include decreases in markers for cancer, diabetes and age related mental decline. Links are by no means proof but correlate with what I have read and heard over the years. 1, 2, 3, 4 "
824,What are some good strength exercises for different skiing practises?,"The ankles and muscles foot to knee are particularly challenged. Similar question to this here on marathons but now focus on skiing and external weights can be used: this can be related to roller skiing, ice skating and skateboarding where the legs, pelvis and core strength are demanded. So  What are some good strength exercises for different skiing practises? "
825,Probiotics: differences between bacterial strains,"There are many bacterial cultures found in probiotic foods.  For example:   B. bacterium breve B. bacterium longum L. acidophilus L. bulgaricus L. casei L. lactis L. plantarum L. rhamnosus Leuconostoc cremoris S. diacetylactis S. florentinus S. thermophilus bifidus   (to name a few common ones)  What are the nutritional differences between the different cultures? Or are all probiotic bacterial cultures created equal?  For example, do some cultures help produce certain types of vitamins? Do some aid in digesting specific foods? "
826,Pulldowns from waist,"A few years ago I was doing seated lat pulldowns. The gym instructor came by and suggested an additional exercise. Using the same machine I stood up and started with my upper arms by my sides and my forearms parallel to the floor. I then pulled down, using forearms only, and back to start. I then did the reps that fitted with the rest of my routine. It seems like a good exercise but: a) Do you know what it is called please? b) Can you please tell me which muscles it works?  Thank you. "
827,Developing fast twitch muscles with small weights,"Or, do we have to use heavy weights for that?   Would isometric exercise be of any use? (theoretically I imagine that these don't have a top of force applied). "
828,Healthy way of losing leg muscle,"I have big legs. This stems from a bad habit I had as a child, that carried on until my late teens, where I would constantly be walking on my toes, essentially always flexing my calves. Combine this with 12+ years of football(soccer) and you get massive legs. Or, well, I did. Both calves and thighs. This has become an issue economically, and to a degree socially. It is impossible to find trousers that fit in the waist, but are wide enough around the legs. It is especially difficult to find trousers that aren't sweatpants, forcing me to have to go to the tailor every time I need trousers for work/social events.  To help with this, I'm looking for a safe and healthy way of losing leg muscle. Is there such a way? Is it possible through specialised training, rather than abstaining? I did try no leg related workout(only daily walking) for a couple of years(!), to no effect. Is this something that's accomplishable by stretching?  In before 'lose fat, not muscle'. Yes, I've done that. According to my BMI I'm morbidly obese, but I have a relatively low body fat. "
829,Simplest diet that provides all essential nutrients,"I know that this is a somehow broad question, especially because nothing here is being defined quantitatively, but I hope it's objectively answerable.  Assuming an average adult male who exercises regularly without much intensity and just wants to maintain a good health, what would be the simplest (smallest) set(s) of foods that could be eaten every day to keep such state (i.e. provide him with all the essential nutrients, not cause any long term negative consequences), being his only source of nutrients? What about using dietary supplements (pills, powders) to reduce such count even further? "
830,Am I missing exercises for a balanced total body workout in a 3 day split?,"I'm working on a 3-day split routine, about 5(+1 support) exercises per day. It's the first time I'm putting something together for myself, so I was hoping you'd be able to put in some comments.   I do not own (I work out at home) cables, just a squatrack, bench, weights and a pull up bar. My prior experience is with stronglifts 5x5 and before that some random using of machines in a gym.  Chest/Triceps      Lying Lateral Raise (shoulder support) Bench Press  (major pec, sternal) Incline Bench Press  (major pec, clav)    Incline Shoulder Raise (serratus) Bench Dips (tricep)   Decline Close Grip Push-up (tricep, could go incline close grip bench press, but want to do push ups because thats just the beach boy I am ;))   Back/Biceps   Lying External Rotation (shoulder support)    Chin-ups (back/bicep)     Deadlift (back)   Barbell Shrugs (traps)        Hammer Curls (bicep/arms)     Bicep Curls  (bicep)   Legs/Schouders     Dumbell Shoulder Internal Rotation (shoulder support) Barbell Squat (quads) Straight-leg deadlift (hams)  Overhead Press (anterior) Upright Row (lateral) Rear Delt Raise (posterior)   I do one rotary cuff exercise daily, mostly prevention for future injury after having had some problems with my supraspinatus. I perform these with a low weight (empty dumbells, 2.5kg each) with a high number of repetitions, 3 sets of 15. My normal sets just will be plain old 3x10, trying to add weight when I get 3x10 with good form.  Any tips in general? I would like to target my glutes better as well, any tips for that?  As you can see it's a pretty short routine, I guess a little over an hour every time, followed by 30-45 minutes of jogging. Supplement wise, I just take a protein shake in the evening.  What say you? "
831,Muscles twitching during non-workout activity,"I've had periods in time where I'm just sitting in the office and all of the sudden one of triceps would start twitching like once per second or a bit more spread out. It doesn't hurt, but it's somewhat ""annoying"" cause it won't stop no matter what I do. I has happened to my triceps, my biceps, shoulders, and one of my legs. Not all together but those are the muscles were this has happened.   These ""episodes"" happen on a period at least 13 hours after my last workout. But I haven't found a relationship between the last workout and the muscle that twitches(If I do leg the day before, is not necessarily my leg that is twitching). Although they don't hurt, should I be concerned? Is it an intake deficit of something or just aftermath of previous workouts?  "
832,Stick with progressing rep ranges or switch to small weight increments?,"I'd like to keep this question general, but it's rather situational so excuse the extra fluff.  At the end of February I finished 6 months of doing Johnny Candito's linear program, control variant. Since then I've started a caloric deficit to lose some excess fat and my focus shifted on maintaining strength and muscle mass, making a little progress where feasible. So I changed to the hypertrophy variant of the program, with some personal modifications. I do 3 sets of 5 to 7 reps on the compound movements like squat and bench press on the heavy day (once per week for upper/lower body), with one extra set at a higher weight for 3 to 5 reps. The hypertrophy day (also once per week for upper/lower) uses lighter weight or other exercises for more reps and sets and is a sort of volume day for me.  My progress is basically: do the 3 sets of 5 with a certain weight, next week try 3x6, the week after 3x7. After that I increase the weight by 2.5 kg (5.5 lbs) and do 5 reps again, then 6 etc. This scheme has worked very well and I'm making progress despite the caloric deficit. Now, since my squat is seriously lagging (especially compared to the deadlift) I'm also doing 3 heavy sets on the lower hypertrophy day for squats, with two lighter sets at higher reps. So squat progress could look like this for the following weeks:  Date       Weight (kg) x sets x reps Thu 12/05  75x3x5,   65x2x10 Mo  16/05  75x3x6,   82.5x1x3 Thu 19/05  75x3x7,   65x2x11 Mo  23/05  77.5x3x5, 82.5x1x4 Thu 26/05  77.5x3x6, 65x2x12 Mo  30/05  77.5x3x7, 82.5x1x5 Thu 02/06  80x3x5,   67.5x2x10   Now, I've gotten some 0.5 kg micro-plates, letting me increment weights by 1 kg. So another option has become: increase the weight each week, but stick with 5 reps. Progress could then look like this (only showing heavy sets):  Date       Weight (kg) x sets x reps Thu 12/05  75x3x5 Mo  16/05  76x3x5 Thu 19/05  77.5x3x5 Mo  23/05  78.5x3x5 Thu 26/05  79.5x3x5 Mo  30/05  80x3x5   Because the micro-plates are 0.5 kg each and the next lowest eight per plate in the gym is 1.25 kg, sometimes there'll be a 1 kg jump, other times 1.5 kg and yet other times 0.5 kg. I figure the above would be decent since the bigger jump is earlier on.  As you can see, by the time Monday 30 May rolls around, the weight, sets and reps would be the same, just a different progression. Which of these approaches would be best right now for me? The 5,6,7 scheme has worked well until now, and by the time the weight increases and the reps drop back to 5 it doesn't feel too taxing because the 7 reps at 2.5 kg less were actually harder. I'm inclined to go with what works. But at the same time, I'm expecting every time to suddenly hit a wall on the weight increase, even if the reps drop, and stalling out again. So maybe small weight increments could be better in keeping momentum and staying at 5 reps which appears to work well for me as a strength builder.  I'm only concerned with this progression up to the start of June. After that I'm switching back to a small caloric surplus and reviewing what would be the best course of action. I just want to hit that 80x3x5 as a short-term goal, because small goals like that keep me going.  I've found this answer, by the way: What are you views on progress between rep range vs. fixed reps?. I understand from it that both approaches could work well, I'm just wondering if someone has any insight in which would be better right now for the following month. So, very situation-specific question. "
833,Ammonia smell when running?,"In my long runs (about 25k) when I finnish the smell of my body is like ammonia, I have read in internet thats because of converting my muscles into energy, so Could I say that my body is not burning fat like it should be? the other question I would like to ask is, How do I know when my body is burning fat correctly? I mean there is some indicator? like the ammonia smell is to burning muscles? "
834,Doubts about the SL 5X5 program,"This week I started doing the StrongLifts 5X5 program but I already have some questions regarding 2 situations. I know posting 2 questions is not very well received but I'd hate to post 2 questions back to back about the same program.   What happens if I reach a limit? Like I fear I will reach my overhead press limit in around 3 weeks(doing the math and based on past maxes) while still being able to increment the weight for squats and dead lifts. Can I just stay in that weight til I overcome it? The program suggests resting between workout a and workout b for a day, but that would leave me Saturday and Sunday free, I used to rest these days but I used to workout out 5 days a week, with only 3 days a week of routine is it okay if I plan to do something less intense than weightlifting(jogging, walking, core exercises) during one of these days?   "
835,Underweight female-gym routines?,"So, I am 5'4"" and weigh 90 pound (20 yrs old).  I went to the gym for the first time today and well, for squats I can't even lift the bar itself. As for the leg press, I can do it but not with any weights on. And on the other machines I can do them but not with added weights. I figure if I go often maybe I could work myself up to weights? I figure maybe if I build muscle I'll weigh more.  I'm new to all of this so any tips or advice or routine would be nice. I did the squat machine where the bar doesn't come off, but i hurt my back doing that. I don't think I'm quite ready for it? :/   Maybe i could do squats just with dumbbells or something? Any help is greatly appreciated.   "
836,What's the reason for bulking up?,"There is a popular fb page that represents bodybuilders in my nation , admins always speak about how you should eat lots of food to pack on muscle mass.They actually recommend that people should eat lots of carbohydrates along with protein to bulk up . I don't get it , i mean from what i've learnt carbohydrate is just only the fuel we need if i ate the carbs i need daily for my daily activities including the workout i won't gain fat weight plus i would be gaining muscle mass.Then, why should i be eating more than my needs ???  Maybe, I need to get my facts corrected .... "
837,Back to the gym after ilness,"I was ill, a flu, or other infection. I know that I had to suspend training sessions. This time it was 2 weeks, so nothing really special. It happens to me from time to time, and usually 2-3 weeks are lost. Then it takes another 2-4 weeks to get back to the weights I had before suspension.   My plan on getting back is - as follows:  First training. I'm doing half of weights - just to find out if everything is OK. I learned it can happen that I feel well, but my body is still ill. So I start with something small, and then get with higher. At each training, somewhere in the middle I test if a higher weight is not a problem - in the beginning higher means +20%. If that works then, next training means +10%. Usually that is too much. Also usually, a single set is not a problem, but whole training is different story.   My question is quite simple. Can I do it better? Can I recover faster? Maybe it is better to go with ""normal"" weight, and do less is better then slowly going up? Please share your ideas, tips, experience. Every answer is welcome! "
838,How to lose fat only in your thigh?,"Let's say I am a pretty skinny guy with a fat thigh. Is it possible to lose fat exclusively in some part of the body? For example, is it possible to lose thigh fat while not losing any weight in my upper body?  "
839,Is it true that thinking uses a lot of calories?,"I have read a lot of stuff that says the brain is one of the parts of the body that consume the most oxygen. Is this true?

840,Do heat and/or compression provably aid in preventing injury?,"There are sleeves for the elbows and knees which trap heat and, depending on thickness and elasticity, provide compression. They're typically made of neoprene. Ignoring the aspects of support and stored elastic energy assisting in some movements, is there evidence to support the notion that these would reduce the potential for injury?  Warmer muscles (up to a certain point, I assume) are said to be less prone to injury, and I've also heard a higher heat would lubricate the joints better, presumably because it could affect the viscosity of synovial fluid. After all, we ""warm up"" before exercise. Is there actual scientific proof that warmer muscles, connective tissue and joints directly benefit from this heat, or is it possibly a case of correlation being mistaken for causation? As in, the heat is merely the effect of the metabolic processes and/or mechanic action taking place in the body and what actually prevents injury is a gradual increase in load and intensity?  Same for compression. Does this actually provide a benefit during exercise other than support and taking over part of the stress on the body tissues? "
841,How do I determine what a paleo diet is?,"Prior to the invention of agriculture, humans lived in numerous climates, ecosystems and environments. So, exactly what is a ""paleo"" diet?   For example, at some point in time before the origin of agriculture, there were ""paleo"" humans who ate grains. The original grain eaters were no doubt hunter-gatherers who happened to live in a region where grains were a ""gathered"" food source. Another example is an acquaintance who follows a paleo diet, but eats a large amount of boneless, skinless chicken breasts. This strikes me as odd, because from what I understand, hunter-gatherers didn't limit themselves to breast meat.   Is there a link perhaps with good clarification on exactly what a paleo diet is? "
842,Foot pain during all exercise - HIIT alternatives?,"I'm at a loss for what to do. For a number of years now the outer underside of both of my feet cause me a lot if pain during excercise - running, cross trainer, walking!! I've tried different footwear &amp; been to a podiatrist but no answers yet.   I've found something online which I think it could be - lateral column overload. But this has not been diagnosed.  A week ago I started a 3 month food &amp; fitness program in a bid to lose some of my extra weight (I'd like to lose about 4 stone). So far I've found the good difficult but manageable &amp; am starting to feel marginally healthier.  However I'm required to do 4 short HIIT workouts per week &amp; my foot pain is causing me a real problem. My feet are extremely painful after about 10 mins of exercising &amp; only gradually improve after about 15 mins of rest.   Can anyone advise about HIIT exercises that won't put pressure on my feet??  Or has anyone heard of/had a similar condition?  Thanks for your help, Jenny "
843,Losing weight altough eating normal because of bouldering?,"I have always had a bit of fat on my body. I was never fat nor even chubby but always 4-5kg too much on myself. I just thought it to be my genes because my whole life i did a bit of sports. Going bycicling sometimes, going swimming, skating, ice-skatin, skiing. I did everything.   Nothing regularly but sometimes. And at my parents altough i ate sweets they cooked fairly healthy. So as stated, i just thought it to be in my genes, to gain fat a bit faster.  But in the last 4-5 months i started going bouldering regularly 2 sometimes 3 times a week for 2-4 hours each time. I dont think that this extremely much of a sporty activity, but still i lost 6kg in these past 4-5 months, altough i built a hella lot of muscle which is actually much heavier than fat. So i must have lost at least 10kg of fat(currently 72kg at 176cm).   But the thing is, i do ate almost the same. Every now and then a Kebab or Burger or yesterday for example a whole 0,5kg cup of ben&amp;jerrys. And everytime after bouldering i drink 1-2 beers (the reward of  course ;) )  I was training in the gym earlier in my live and noticed no real weight loss.  How can his be? Is doing something regularly so much of an impact on the body? Is maybe bouldering such a good sports of loosing weight because you need to whole body for it, in contrast to working out in a gym? If yes, how does this work? Is the metabolism so turned on or what is the reason for my pretty significant weight loss?  This is my first time here in FitnessSE and i hope this question is in the scope of it :) If not let me know and i will change the question accordingly "
844,How can I train to run a sub-45 minute 10k?,I have joined a charity race in 1 and a half month's time. (I have 7 weeks before the race)  My PB for 10k is 48:45.  I have been running on and off since then but I can still run a 26 min 5k if I push hard.  Is my goal realistic and what's the best way to achieve it? What sort of schedule do I need? 
845,How does strength training affect one's health and life expectancy in the long run?,"I understand that aerobic exercise are very beneficial for one's health, but I always have doubts about muscle training. I know that bodybuilding makes you heavier, stronger and more attractive, but is it really beneficial for one's health in the long run?   Or let me put it this way: suppose that A does strength training regularly, B does aerobic exercises regularly, C does not physical training at all. Assuming all other conditions are the same, my guess is that the life expectancy of B will be much longer than A and C, while the life expectancy of A may only be slightly longer, or even not necessarily longer than C. Am I right? "
846,MadCow Routine - When to stop / restart?,"In this pic I added the first day of my MadCow spreadsheet.  My question(s) are:  When do I stop (start over)? For example, if I started Week 6 and I will try to squat 5 reps of 110kg But I only manage to do 4 reps  Do I then update my Squat and start again on week 1? Or should I keep going until I am unable to do even 1 rep?    Second.  If I fail at doing 5 reps in squat, but I manage to do 5 reps in benchpress, IF I have to restart my squat then, do I also have to restart my benchpress, or can they be on seperate weeks?  Example  Squat is reset and is now on week 2 Benchpress is still going and is on week 8   "
847,"By systematical training, can strength and muscle continue to grow despite the aging?","Let's say if one starts a good, systematical strength training programme at the age of 30. I would say he should be physically much stronger when he turns 40. What if he just continue this training programme? Can his strength just continue to grow, despite the aging? Or in other words, can he be physically stronger when he is 70, or 80 years old, compared with when he was 30 or 40? "
848,Is a bench press with a swiss bar easier on the shoulders than with a standard bar w/ overhand grip?,It seems like I strain my supraspinatus too often when bench pressing with my standard bar w/ overhand grip; how do bench presses with a swiss bar compare using a grip parallel to my torso?  Would that place less strain on my shoulders? 
849,When will muscle be cannibalized?,"Can you tell me what are all the cases when muscle would be cannibalized? I've heard the two following cases will cannibalize muscle, but I still don't quite understand.  Aerobic Exercise  Arnold Schwarzenegger says in The New Ecyclopedia of Modern Bodybuilding:     Too much aerobics also encourages the   body to metabolize lean body mass --   muscle -- to create additional energy.   The body can actually cannibalize   muscle tissue, especially white fiber   ""power"" muscle in order to fuel   aerobic exercise.   Why would the human body evolve to cannibalize muscle during cardio? Why not just take energy from the food in your stomach (granted that you do have leftover food)?  Skinny People  Scooby from Youtube says that the body's energy stores are three tiered - Food > Fat > Muscle. If energy can not be obtained from one tier, the body seeks the next tier. Since muscle is the last tier, and virtually everyone has some amount of fat, how is the muscle tier ever reached? I suppose the muscle tier will be reached for anorexic people, how about for everyone else?  High Intensity Training  Jamez said this in an article on optimal rep range:     Remember the muscle-building process   described in Grow Baby, Grow?   Microtrauma stimulates increased   protein synthesis, and muscle growth   is positively affected by a number of   hormones that are released after   weight training. High volume, multiple   set programs cause more microtrauma   and greater hormone secretion-so the   end result is more muscle!      This probably explains why I was   unimpressed with HIT. Although HIT   uses high reps, you only perform one   ""hardcore"" set per bodypart. I   actually lost muscle and began to feel   like I didn't even train!   His train of logic isn't so clear. What about HIT causes muscle loss? "
850,Are BCAA supplements and/or creatine necessary when balancing power and cardio training?,"Background: I am 33 y.o. about 1.77 (which is like 5'10in) around 200-205 lbs. According to BMI measurements I am overweight but in reality I have a big frame, broad shoulders and compact built, fairly athletic but perhaps not fully fit. According to my impedance scale (which are not entirely reliable by default) body fat index around 20-21%.  I am at the gym 3-5 times a week, combined with basketball, soccer and squash depending on scheduling. I bike to work and back 30-45 mins every day. What I am trying to get to is that I do have a fairly active lifestyle, despite being in front of a computer all day.   I have started noticing that while I notice improvements on the appearance (bigger arms etc) I am not really getting stronger, in the sense that I can't really do more pull-ups than before, just to give an example. I haven't been able to make much progress in terms of weights in bench press, squats etc.   My main goal for the workout (besides being healthier) is to shed the extra weight, to get better into better shape so that I strain my joints less when I do ball sports. I don't really need to bulk up as I am fairly heavy-set by default, but I don't want to lose any strength by focusing solely on cardio training.  Given the goal of shedding the weight without losing any muscle strength, and the fact that I am not making much quantitative progress, do I need to take supplements like BCAA or creatine etc to make sure I am not burning through the muscles throughout the workouts? I see people taking pre-work out shakes or some suspiciously colorful stuff during the workouts. What is that about? "

860,"When running with toe-first technique, should heels touch the ground?","I'm a beginner runner for years. Usually I've had to stop running after a while because of knee problem or common colds. Because of the first, I've got interested in toe-first technique (referred also as barefoot running technique).   My first attempt hasn't taken long because of very strong calves fatigue. The muscle activity unusual for my body has made it hard for me to concentrate fully on details, but I've noticed I was running quite fast, and my heels were not touching or slightly touching the ground, and it was quite painful for my calves.  What is the proper technique when toe-first running? Should the heel have a solid contact with the ground, or it should only slightly touch it? Or it shouldn't touch it all, so that only the front part of the feet has contact with the ground? It seems to be the most fatiguing for the calves...  "
861,Amino Energy whilst & post Workout,"I take half scoop Grenade pre-workout and then I start the session with Weight Training (~1hr) after which I take black coffee and then move to core/cardio routine (~20-30 mins). Post that I take 2-scoop Ultimate Nutrition Whey Protein.  I was wondering if I can try ON Amino Energy in the water intake that I do throughout the day.   I'm asking because after a heavy workout I usually feel a bit tired during the day.  Sometimes when the pre-workout fades after ~30-40mins, I thought the Amino Energy can help me go through the workout at a smooth pace too.  So, is it okay if I use ON Amino Energy whilst and post workout throughout the day? Or is it just a fad and does no good?  PS: My training goal is to shred (lose weight).  What's your opinion?  "
862,Breathing and Leg Fatigue while running,"OK - I know this has been discussed and over-discussed here, and all over the web - but for me, I cannot seem to find any solutions.  I am hoping there are either professionals, or kindred-spirits with the same problem, who can offer some insights, advice or solutions.  The problem is that I get out of breath or leg fatigue = particularly when running (or walking) any kind of incline or stairs.  The same thing happens when I do any kind of squat-like exercise.  When I run, essentially what happens is that I can run a few paces (20?) and then either my legs just get tired, or out of breath and I have to walk 10-20 paces. On a completely flat surface I can go up to 100 paces without stopping.  Before I get a deluge of knee-jerk advice, a few facts:   I am in my late 40s, and in very good health and shape. This problem has been with me since I can remember (in my 20s). I have had thorough medical workups - stress tests etc - from the Mayo clinic. In perfect health. (My wife and many friends are cardiologists). I have been running for 15 years or more ...  in the past 5 years I have been running an average of 8-11 miles, 3 times a week. In the past 18 months, I have run a few 10ks and a half marathon. My running times have really never improved (due to this breathing/leg fatigue issue. The running times are embarrassingly bad (for someone who runs so much). every other day I work out with weights, and do some stretching. I have  also tried combinations of vitamins and albuterol inhaler ... with no real effect  (I measure almost everything about my runs ... from the temperature, elevations, to caffeine intake, sleep etc) Maybe, in 1 out of every 30 runs, I have a few good uninterrupted stretches of running (100-200 paces) ...  in the half marathon last year (flat surface) I was able to run for an uninterrupted 1200 paces in one stretch. Overall this breathing/leg problem has not gotten any better or worse over the past 5+ years, except that recently I moved to an area where my runs are always on some kind of slight incline. (incidentally my running does not improve all that much on the decline!)   I am really running out of solutions and getting to the point where I don't want to run anymore.  Any insights from experienced runners? inexperienced? trainers? faith healers? I'll try anything any this point!  Thanks! "

What can I do to check if the sensor/transmitter is actually working? "
866,Do training breaks affect the 'novice effect'?,"Starting Strength book mentions the 'novice effect', where a novice can gain strength very quickly and increase lifts every workout.  Does taking a break during the novice phase affects this?  Is there a 'window of opportunity' for the novice effect?

To give a better idea, I'd like to be looking like the guy on the left in the picture below. I think I'm pretty close to the guy on the right now, although I probably have slightly more body fat.    For such a goal, do I have to go through a whole bulk/cut deal and all that serious stuff? If not, how do I make sure to gain the muscles and lose the fat to transition from the right pic to the left pic? I know this is a very broad question, but I'm just looking for the big picture - I'll figure out the details later. "

When squatting I've tried wide ( outside shoulder width, toes out ) but really find this tough on flexibility.   The most comfortable postion is a realatively narrow stance, ( I'm broad shouldered, you could call it a 'nipple stance' ) with quite a bit of external knee rotation ( if that makes sense, I 'spread the floor' as they say ).  Am I risking anything in this position? Possible knee trouble down the line? Am I missing out on posterior chain development?  "

870,"Progressive, linear steady cardio program with a stationary bike provided with heart rate meter","I am doing a simple strength training routine once every four days (Sxxx). I need to introduce a very low impact cardio day in this routine (e.g. SxCx). I would like to use the stationary bike (not the treadmill or elliptical machine) and I would like to keep it very simple, avoiding such things as intervals or HIIT. Just ""classic"" steady cardio on the bike.  It does not need to be the most efficient program. I just want to be sure I don't do anything unhealthy out of ignorance.  The bike has a built-in hear rate instant meter. How should I approach training my heart under that circumstances? Is the following naive program unhealthy or ineffective? 30 minutes at 60% of my max HR. The next session (four days later) I aim for 61% and so and so until reaching 30 min at 80% of my max heart rate (or until the month of June arrives and I switch to swimming).  For those who are about to answer ""it depends on your goals"": well, my average resting heart rate just before quitting running was 53 bmp, and now it is 66 bpm. I just want to lower it down again. The strength training alone is definitely not training my heart. "
871,Donkey kick primary muscle used,"I know that in donkey kicks, glutes are the major muscle used. However I would like to ask about a technical aspect of this exercise, if while rising, the knee is kept  bent (the angle  alpha  in the picture) with an angle less than  90°, does this will be trageting more the glute muscles?

875,Weight loss on a vegan diet,"Just to give you guys some background. I am a 29 year old female and I have always maintained a +-5 pounds from 120 since I can remember and I am 61 inches tall(around 5'1). My diet is a vegan whole foods diet but I eat meat when I go out sometimes. lately the weight keeps piling. I have gone from 120-145 in four months.   This is what my diet looks like:  Breakfast: breakfast smoothie with power greens blend, coconut milk, flax seed meal,banana, and a cup of mixed berries, totaling 360 calories.  Lunch: beans and lentils with collard greens included= 433 calories and apple =80 calories  Snack: homemade hummus = 163 calories, with carrots =40 calories or with celery  Dinner: tofu kale salad with sesame oil = 320 calories  Daily total = 1376calories, lots of water throughout the day.  I also have lots of energy  Here is my work out routine:  Monday: I do strength training. Qquats with weight, jump lunges, and all those leg machines you see at the gym which I don't know what are called, but I do a full lower body workout for 30mins, then I run for 30mins.  Tuesday: I do upper body. Lifting, pushups, and also all those upper body machines at the gym for 30mins, then I do the stir master for 30 mins afterwards.  Wednesday: I do core for 30mins and light bicylcing at the gym for about 15 mins.  Thursday: I go swim laps for 30mins.  Friday: I eat a bunch of junk food at the office and don't exercise  Saturday: sometimes i go for a two mile walk and sometimes I'm just a couch potato.  Sunday: I go to Yoga, then start all over again on Monday.   I've been doing weight training for about 3 months. Before that, my exercise was just running a lot and hiking a lot, but since I added weights, I seem to be gaining weight and my mid section is looks bigger.   I am supposed to eat 1280 cals a day to lose 2 pounds a week, but I find my self eating about 1300-1600 calories a day now.  That being said: Can someone please explain to me why I am gaining weight instead. I don't look leaner. I probably look the same or a little bigger. Also, what would you suggest I do for my stomach. is it normal to experience weight gain when I seem to be doing the right thing. Also, is it possible that getting older has slowed down my metabolism? Would you guys recommend sticking to the strict 1280 calories a day even if I workout?  I know I don't get enough proteins because of my diet, is there a way for me to get more protein on a vegan diet? my goal is to lose the extra 15 pounds I have gained in a healthy manner. Thanks a lot in advance. "

877,How to reduce risk of injury in strength training (when not training at a gym),"I have been thinking about taking up weight training, mainly to build up by back, triceps, and biceps. I did not want to go to a gym to do the exercises, though. I would prefer to do them at home but I heard that there is a risk of injury if strength training movements are not done correctly.  In my case I was thinking about getting some home gym (such as one of those sold at Sears), as it seems that this is useful for some of the muscle movements.  I do not have any previous injury or surgery of any kind and overall my health is good. I am not particularly overweight (5' 5"" at 115 lbs).  It seems that incorrect exercise movements can cause injury even if a person has taken care of warming up and stretching before the training, is this correct?    Are there specific exercises for triceps, biceps, and back strength that are more prone to injury, if done incorrectly. If so, what are these and what should a person keep in mind to reduce the risk of injury in these cases? "

880,"Inzer single prong belt, need thoughts and/or comments about size issue","I need some solid input from you guys.  My friend let me try his Inzer lever belt, it's a size medium, here's the thing though, the medium measurements for the lever belt are 30 to 33.  When I used the inzer belt, I was basically 1 hole from the tighest setting, if you've used the lever belt it has the plate on the back side that you adjust when you cut/bulk. This setting pinched me a bit more than I liked but I felt like the amount of support I had was perfect.  I ordered a single prong inzer belt, sized medium, because I prefer the prong over the lever. But here's where I made the mistake and just want you guys to confirm or give thoughts. The single prong medium is measured for 33 to 35.  I got my single prong medium today and honestly, it cucked me. I'm like literally one hole away from where I feel like the belt would give me the support I'm looking for but I cannot get it in. So the next hole down I just don't have the abdominal pressure I want compared to the inzer.  So I'm thinking damn, it all makes sense now, after looking at the measurements. The inzer lever belt for me felt the best on nearly the tightest setting, that means the belt for me probably fit in the 30 to 32 range since the 33 would be too big, considering the lowest range of the medium prong is 33 inches, and it's just 1 hole away from probably being a good fit.  The small prong is 28 to 32 inches, so I have the top end of the fit on that belt to fit in the 30 to 32 inch fit on the lever belt. So obviously, I should've gone with the small prong belt to begin with, right? Or am I just retarded and the pronged belts don't give as much support as the lever belt?  I still have at least 3 more holes on the medium belt before it's completely tight. Would I even benefit from a smaller size? "
881,"Goals in order: run faster, lose bodyfat","Some background  Male, born 1991, 184 cm, desk job  In November 2016 I was about 103kg.  Went to a dietitian and began a diet based on healthy balance of foods, breakfast, snacks between meals, food diary etc (nothing ""special"" like Dukan which I previously did and relapsed from). Goal was to get to a healthy weight with eating patterns/habits that I could keep for long.  Around March 2017 I reached my goal weight of 85 kg. Dietitian advised me to keep coming once a month until October 2017 to avoid/correct ""relapses"".  In August 2017, my doctor and physiotherapist gave me the green light to start running again (having had multiple herniated discs in middle back, lower back and neck). I have been going to the physiotherapist twice a week since April 2017 for mainly core exercises / body balance / weight-lifting / ... and still going.  I've been enjoying the running, having followed training podcasts until 10km distance. Afterwards I tried to keep the same schedule of lessons from the podcast (intervals, easy run, long run) up to 21k (half marathon). Now I run a 50 minute 10k, and a 2h10 21k. I will not attempt to go beyond a half marathon in distance.  Currently 80kg (January 2018), steady since November 2017.  Goals  I would like to (in order of importance)   Lose ~10kg in bodyweight, so I can run faster. While I have improved my pace a lot since starting to run again and while I am still doing interval and anaerobic training to increase my speed, there is an easy speed gain to be made by just losing weight. This is more vanity, but my weight-loss has still left me with a nice fat layer, especially on my gut/hips and upper legs. I would like to eliminate this as well (already knowing that spot-reduction isn't a real thing).   Question  Researching a way to achieve goal #2, I often read: diet by eating fewer carbs, weight-lifting, little to no cardio. This directly conflicts with goal #1, doing a lot of running (cardio) and need to be properly fueled for (carbs).  Can I combine reaching these 2 goals without having the one interfere with the other? If so, how?    Where should I focus on diet? Where should the balance be between running and strength work in my case?  "

883,Cardio with Plantar Fasciitis?,"I got plantar fasciitis when I was training to become a spin and yoga instructor. I overworked my feet by doing hours of spin and yoga a day for 3 weeks. By the time I realized there was a problem, I couldn't walk, had to get cortisone shots, needed to go to physical therapy and see an orthopedist regularly. The reason that the fasciitis and tendinitis got so bad was because I have neuropathy in my feet so I don't feel pain when I'm supposed too. I do plan on retaking my training in a few months (although maybe this is a bad idea) and I would like to start spinning again in a month. Until then, what type of cardio can I do? I am trying to lose weight. I currently am doing Pilates regularly but need some cardio. I do not have access to a pool. Suggestions?  "
884,iliotibial band pain when trying to increase cadence and run faster," late 30s 1.8metre 85kg   after spending about 1.5 months running at around   7.5 min / km 153 spm avg heart rate 155 to 160 bpm vertical oscillation 11cm 10km per run 30km+ per week,   i've been working on speed and trying to increase spm (ideally 180spm), by doing these 2 things:   keeping stride length low reducing vertical oscilation to below 10cm   it's really awkward at first trying to force myself into a difference cadence, but there were significant improvements. by forcing my cadence i was able to reach   170 spm, with 9cm vertical oscillation, and my average heart rate dropped to 150 bpm+ while my speed went up to around 7min / km, for a 10km run.   I'm not sure why, deliberately increasing spm and decreasing vertical movement not only made the run faster, it seems to have made the effort much easier on my heart.  but i am starting to develop pain on the outside of my right knee. i think somehow my running form changed, or maybe increasing the speed somehow aggravated an already existing issue, but i never had iliotibial band pain when running at low speeds. About 4 years ago i had a similar issue when i didn't know much about running and ran fast (but short distances, like around 2km to 4km), but it went away when i switched to longer distance (>10km) at much lower pace. Somehow increasing speed tends to give me iliotibial band pain on my right knee.  Does anyone have similar issues? Should I stop working on cadence and switch back to slow running? But I want to run faster, spending more than 1 hour per run seems ineffective if I can only run 10km each run (because of the low speed, it's hard for me to go higher distances without spending large amounts of time running). I've been running at 150+ spm for a very long time, and I think it's the reason why I am slow, but it seems very hard to go anywhere near 180spm. "
885,Getting back in shape: beating the odds against sedentary work-routines and team sports mentality,"I am soon turning 27 and am in bitter realization that the years are working against me, physically speaking. I have a very compact body, at 177 cm.s I weigh around 94 kg.s even though I do not have a large gut (but instead wide shoulders and a big chest). Can't say I have ever been perfectly fit, but I've always been sportive and played any kind of ball sports I could through-out my youth up until a year ago or so...  Over the years I have had a couple of nasty injuries (such as shoulder dislocations) which essentially limit my options in training. The latest injury being some peculiar chronic pain in the lower back region just above the hip. The physios and chiropractors I have seen could not really find a reason for the problem, but the reality of the matter is; I work in front of a PC and the more I sit the weaker I get. I need to train to increase/recover my stamina, condition and strength however when I do my usual sports I just get serious cramps in my lower back.   I have never managed to like pure cardio training as in spinning (indoor cardio biking), or jogging. I find it incredibly boring as nothing really happens, in comparison to a football game where you have to follow up the events, read the game and other players and act accordingly. Besides it's a very individual-based type of training, meaning that there is no team interaction like I'm used to.   I guess the majority of the people here are somehow fitness buffs, so the description I gave above might sound alien to some, but if there is anyone out there with a similar mindset or if anyone can relate to my situation, I'd really appreciate some advice on:   Is there a kind of cardio training I could do that is more suitable for someone like me? How can I make jogging/running more fun? (Where I live it's rainy or worse the majority of the year) How can I improve my self discipline, pushing myself through the annoyance when it's needed? (I'm a very competitive-minded person so I was excited when products like Nike Fuelband and Jawbone UP came out, unfortunately the Fuelband is still not sold in Europe and the UP is retracted from the market without a word on when it will be available again)   Thanks in advance, "

887,Can weight lost be sustained through exercise influenced metabolism changes?,"Background: This question was prompted by a few comments from user:michael     Reading through a recent New York Times article related to the subject prompted me to prove further into the topic of metabolism and how it is affected by exercise and weight loss.    ""The biggest loser"" is a show where contestants compete against each other to lost weight the fastest. It has come under a lot of criticism for ""fat shaming"" and there are many controversies surrounding the show. In a recent New York times article there was evidence put forward that some people just cannot keep weight off due to the changes in metabolism.  In the article, Dr. Hall, an expert on metabolism at the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, which is part of the National Institutes of Health is quoted:      It has to do with resting metabolism, which determines how many   calories a person burns when at rest. When the show began, the   contestants, though hugely overweight, had normal metabolisms for   their size, meaning they were burning a normal number of calories for   people of their weight. When it ended, their metabolisms had slowed   radically and their bodies were not burning enough calories to   maintain their thinner sizes.      Researchers knew that just about anyone who deliberately loses weight   — even if they start at a normal weight or even underweight — will   have a slower metabolism when the diet ends. So they were not   surprised to see that “The Biggest Loser” contestants had slow   metabolisms when the show ended.      ...As the years went   by and the numbers on the scale climbed, the contestants’ metabolisms   did not recover. They became even slower, and the pounds kept piling   on. It was as if their bodies were intensifying their effort to pull   the contestants back to their original weight.   Looking online, there are articles that state that exercise can improve your MR and even your BMR:   Hames KC et al. 2016 National Health Service: ""How Can I Speed Up My Metabolism?"" (2015)  Perry, C. Applied Physiology, Nutrition, and Metabolism (2008)  American Council on Exercise: ""Trimming Off the Fat."" (no date)  Lee, P. Cell Metabolism (2014).   And even the odd article that conclused the opposite of the finding of the NYT! Svetkey LP, Stevens VJ, Brantley PJ, et al. (2008) finds,      Conclusions:  The majority of individuals who successfully completed an initial behavioural weight loss program maintained a   weight below their initial level. Monthly brief personal contact   provided modest benefit in sustaining weight loss, whereas an   interactive technology-based intervention provided early but transient   benefit.     Question:  Is weight regain following a diet inevitable due to changes in metabolism or can a sustained better lifestyle which includes exercise change your BMR to bring it to normal levels for your reduced weight?  Bonus: Is The Biggest Loser a indicator of a larger (forgive the pun) problem with losing weight or is the show a outlier due to its nature?  Notes  Please do not focus on why the weight was gained in the first place. There are many reasons as to why Americans have a greater level of obesity but this question does not want to discuss that.  Please give full sources for all statements made in your answers, and clearly indicate what you believe to be common knowledge or your (or others) opinion. Bonus points for citing like I have using the description of a link.   Edit: This article has been discussed further on reddit's r/fitness [website]"
888,cold hands after 15km run - evening training after work,"I'm preparing for a marathon.  I ran 15km yesterday evening. First 10km were ok but at faster speed (10.76Km) than usual. Than the last 5km were tedious. I experienced cold hands, which I've never experienced so far.  I arrived home and craved for anything with sugar. After 15mn, the cold left.  I experienced some cramps this evening, not massive though.  Question are the following:    Should I put a tiny stash of sugar in my pocket to be able to avoid having cold hands? How come I experienced cold hands? This is not the first time but this is the first time, it was so intense I had to stop running  Should I drink much more before starting a 15k training in the evening, after a day of work?   Thanks for your input "
889,How can I design a simple as possible weight lifting program that involves all the big compund exercises?,"My goal with weight training is:   increase testosterone production (I am in my 40s) => heavy compund exercises strengthen posterior chain (I sit at a desk all day long) spend as little time as possible   At the moment I am training twice a week with the same program both days:   Deadlift  Pulldowns  Benchpress  Stability exercise   I want to add squat to my program. One specific reason for this is that I have had meniscus operation on one knee and the doctor specifically mentioned that strengthening the muscles around the knee would be good. (Shoulder press seemes to be mentioned as one of ""the big four"" compound exercises which seem to indicate that it is important. So maybe I should add that as well?) However I do not have the mental concentration to do squat on the same day as deadlift. How can I create a simple program that solves this?  I considered training three times a week with two different programs. However then I would do each exercise only 1.5 times a week. Is not this too little? At the time I am only doing 3 sets. If I increased this to 4 sets the total number of sets would be the same. Not sure if this is the same though.  Training 4 times a week with two different programs would solve this.  However 4 times a week is a lot. Then I think my program should also involve some high intensity interval cardio.  I would like to run on a threadmill + use a row machine as interval training. I guess running on the threadmill the same day as the squat would be difficult? On the other hand rowing conflicts with the back exercises.  How can I best solve this? "
890,What are the ways to reach the optimal running cadence (180 steps per minute)?,"I have recently learned that the optimal stride rate is 180 steps per minute.  Other than listening to a metronome while running, does anybody have any tips on what can I do to monitor my stride rate so that I know I am around 180 spm?  One way would be to find songs that are ~180 bpm and work with that. Anything else? "
891,Can a routine be designed around deadlifts?,"There are a lot of claims made from comments on CNS impact to squats being more important...  From Ice Cream Fitness:      Deadlifts are 1x5 for a reason. They are taxing on your CNS and if you mess around you will get hurt. So don't be the tough guy who wants to do 5x5 deadlifts, because you will fail miserably   Mehdi also talks about it in StrongLifts.  Can someone give a definitive answer? Can a routine be designed around deadlifts? If so, what does it look like?  Assume the routine would be primarily aimed and increasing 'strongman' strength and deadlift 1RM weight. The goal is to be strong, not 'ripped'. "
892,Taking BCAAs before workouts - carbs or no carbs?,"I'm seeing conflicting information on using BCAAs before a workout. One resource says to take them before a workout with carbs to help get the BCAAs into the muscles due to the insulin boost. Another resource says to avoid carbs at least 2 hours before working out (doesnt say why).  If the goal for BCAA supplimenting is for additional fat loss and lean muscle gain, which is the correct answer? Does it differ for low intensity vs high intensity workouts? "
893,When should I do accessory work?,"When should I be doing accessory work? Does the timing largely depend on me, or is there a conventional/preferred time to do them?   Should I stick it at the end of a workout day after the core lifts are completed?  Can I do some of it at the beginning and some of it the end and then do the core lifts in the middle?  Should I be doing them on a separate day?  Does it matter that much? "
894,Relevance of selected activity in a fitness tracker while using a heart monitor,"I work as a cycle courier so my shift involves cycling, climbing stairs and sometimes walking around while waiting for a job.  I'd like to record my activity with something like Strava or Endomondo but don't want to have to keep changing the activity.  If I'm using a chest strap heart monitor will the calorie burn be calculated solely from that? My understanding is that the selected activity is just for a) a record of what you did and b) to more accurately calculate calorie burn based on time/ speed whatever. It's this correct?  My plan was just to record the shift as 'other' or even 'ride' and be aware that's not all I did and the calorie burn would still be (as) accurate (as it can be). "
895,Training different parts in turn,"I work on my abs twice a week, usually I do it on my leg, chest days. Can I train chest and abs in turn?  Example: 30min chest 5min abs 10min chest 5min abs 5min shoulder 5min abs 5min shoulder 5min abs  Or should I work abs after I finish chest? If I do them in turn, they get rested so I have more energy to do more sets, but I don't know this will affect the result or not.  What is the optimal amount of sets for training? "
896,What is wrong with a beginner following the Rock workout schedule?,"So I am about 5 months into training and I am struggling to come up with a suitable routine. My gym buddy suggested me to do what rock does, which is simply-put, one muscle group a day, 2 day rest, repeat (arms/legs/back/chest/shoulders).  But from what I have read, I will reach super-compensation way before I repeat the muscle group in my schedule, as I do it 1/7 days. So to reach super-compensation, I need to hit every muscle group about twice a week, but that seems to be a lot to cover in a day(about 6 different workouts for each group). So I am not convinced that what I am doing now is the best schedule for me.    So what should be my approach to get efficient results. Should I take super-compensation into account? Workout multiple muscle groups and hit  them more often? Or should I just hit one muscle group a day like the rock does?   P.S I do take protein supplements and follow a fair diet.  Height - 6', Weight - 173 lbs, BF% - ~15%, Squat - 120 lbs, Bench press - 135 lbs, Dead-lift - 105 lbs. "
897,Running shoes: are EVA soles that bad?,"Are modern ""barefoot running"" or air-cushion running shoes better that the previous EVA-soles of the 80s and 90s?   I feel better protected with the EVA, landing solidly on the heel, and have the impression that shoes that are too soft hurt my ankles (since they provide less stability). Normally, I run 3-5 miles 3x/week and weight 70kg.   Are EVA-shoes that bad? "
898,Any reason for feeling nausea when working out?,"I seldom exercise and hardly even go for a jog. I have been living this way for over 20 years. I have high metabolism and have a body shape of an ectomorph; I am skinny.   Recently, I wanted to bulk up my body. I started off with the basics, mainly home exercises like crunches and press ups. I read from somewhere that 3 reps of 12 for both crunches and press ups would be a good start.   So what I do is: 12 times of crunches, rest 30 seconds, another 12 times of crunches, rest 30 seconds again, and the last set of 12 times of crunches. I do the same for press ups. Is this too much? I doubt this is even helping me to bulk up.  The problem, however, is I feel slightly nauseous after doing these. If we spin ourselves in a circular motion for a couple of minutes, stop and wait after the giddiness has faded off, there is still a remaining nauseous feeling. The remaining nauseous feeling is close to how I feel when I am doing the workouts. The nausea turns me off to exercising. I have tried going to a gym, worked on some machines and walked out in 15mins because I gradually feel uncomfortable with the nausea. The nauseous feeling does not kill nor feel extremely unbearable but it makes me feel sick and a little giddy.   I still feel okay when I have done only about 1 rep of crunches and press ups.   Are there any particular reasons or lack of nutritions that I am feeling this way? Is this simply how I would feel when beginning to exercise after lazing for so many years? Or have I for a start overworked?  "
899,Pain after doing squats for a new exerciser,"I just started working out, as I am trying to be more healthy. I am very overweight and trying to lose fat. I put on a lot since giving birth and having my c-section.   My core has gotten much better and no problems with my arms, however I attempted to do my legs and now they really hurt. I just did 20 squats with a small weight (10 pounds), which did not hurt too much when doing them, but the day after I felt like a mack truck crushed my legs. I don't want to stop squats as I really need to make my legs stronger, but I am not sure how much I should do next time to not be so sore. I understand a little soreness is normal, however I think mine is a little excessive as I am having difficulty lowering my body to sit in a chair or get into my car.   When should I attempt squats again and should I decrease the reps, or weights? Which would be better in order to start, or do you have recommendations for a good full body routine for a beginner? Mind you, this is new to me and I don't want to get frustrated and stop, however I don't want to injure myself either. Trying to do the right thing and get healthy!!! "
900,Will taking Vitamin D supplements harm my bodies ability to produce it itself?,"It is known that the human body can produce vitamin D itself when exposed to enough sunlight. But will the body downregulate this natural production of vitamin D, if I take a vitamin D supplement? And if so, will the body increase natural vitamin D production again, when I stop taking vitamin D? Or will taking vitamin D permanently harm my bodies ability to produce vitamin D itself? "
901,How much does adrenaline/warming up effect strength performance?,"Warming up is important for safety reasons, but I'm not asking about that. I would like to know how much psyching yourself up and being pumped with adrenaline affects an athlete's performance in strength activities.  Tom Boyle's example comes to mind. In his case, this weight lifter lifted half a 3,000 pound car of the ground, so as to save a trapped cyclist. He damaged his body as a result, tragically. The article doesn't go into extensive detail about how this was possible, and how much was related to adrenaline.  I would like to ask for more details on this subject. How big a role does adrenaline play in performance? Have there been tests measuring performance without warm-ups versus with warm-ups? "
902,What activity level should I choose in calorie calculators?,"My goal is to gain weight, primarily for muscle bodybuilding (not professional). In various online calorie calculators I need to choose my activity level. I'm always stuck on which one to choose.  For example, this one ([website]My workout is 3x a week weightlifting, 3 sets of 8-12 reps, 3 day split, in the gym about 30-45 mins. Am I supposed to include my workout activity into this calculator?  But my job is largely sedentary, sitting on an office chair. My home activity is fairly sedentary.  What should I pick to get a better estimate of calories for weight gain? "
903,Effect of squat and dead lift on long distance running,"I've primarily been a long distance runner, but I have recently started incorporating swimming and upper body exercises into my weekly exercise program.  My latest addition is compound exercises like squat and dead lift. After a one hour proper introduction with a personal trainer, I was surprised to find I got really sore muscles the following day.  I realize these exercises affect my muscles differently than running does, but that got me to thinking: What's the long term effect of combining squats and dead lifts with long distance running? Is it mutually beneficial, a hindrance, or, perhaps, no significant mutual effect?  To clarify, I'm not taking up squat and dead lift to improve my running. I'm merely looking to see if there are any arguments for or against combining long distance running with squat and dead lift in my weekly exercise routine. "
904,Is this still HIIT? How can I tweak my routine?,"I've been doing interval training on the treadmill for quite some time now. My routine started out with a simple minute-minute preset regime on an inexpensive treadmill which I have since killed with overuse and replaced with a superior one. The minute-minute interval saw me through a lot of weight loss and dramatically boosted my fitness.  The new treadmill has an 'interval' preset, which recalculates intervals based on the workout duration entered. So, for a one-hour training session, each interval is four minutes long (four minute run, four minute walk). A fourty-five minute duration gives me three-three, etc. The program simply halves the run-speed for the cooldown, so if I'm running at 12Km/h the cooldowns are at 6Km/h.  After about a month of doing that program 3-5 times a week, I felt that I wasn't working hard enough, simply because the cooldown period seemed too long, so I decided on ""switching all systems to manual"". My manually-controlled regime now consists of either a fourty-five minute or one-hour long interval session of running at 12-13Km/h for 1Km, followed by a three-minute walk at anything between 6 to 6.8Km/h. I try to do this daily.  Main Q: Can my current regime still be classified as HIIT? I have read so much conflicting literature on the subject over the past two years, that I'm having trouble drawing a solid conclusion (instinctively I would say ""Yes"" but I figured this would be the place to get a more informative answer).  Bonus: What is an effective way of gradually increasing the intensity of the overall workout? As in, by how much should I be 'upping' the average speed and how frequently? Or should I only be 'upping' the speed of the running part, keeping the cooldown intervals at a walk? Should I be tweaking the time intervals?  I am deeply confused.  Note: I do weight training at least twice a week, so there's no need for any skit on fast/slow twitch muscle fibers, etc.  (Sorry for the long read) "
905,Squat form: out or down?,"What's the right to squat: Focus on driving up and down, or on sticking one's backside out?  From what guys at the gym say, and many pictures online, you need to be sticking yourself out.  Yet from Starting Strength's instructions: focusing on tightening lower back, chest up, hip drive - it seems to be more of an up down motion, without as much protrusion.  Which is correct? Does the backside need to protrude? "
906,Critique of my prep for a bikini competition,"I am a 22 year old female, current weight 138lbs, goal weight 120lbs. Current body fat 30%, goal body fat ~15-18%. I am entering a bikini fitness competition in July, so I have around 22 weeks left. I have been weightlifting for over 2 years so have quite well-developed muscles but have a lot of fat to lose. My goal is to maintain existing muscle mass, develop more mass in glutes/hamstrings/rear delts while shredding a ton of fat. My max deadlift 100kg, squat 77.5kg, bench 40kg, press 25kg. I know that I can definitely improve these numbers but have recently taken 3 months off the gym  before starting prep.  I have been prepping for 2 weeks now and below is my exercise and nutrition routine. I would be grateful if anyone could critique it and suggest changes and improvements.  Daily calories: 1600 99g carb (keeping it low as I'm sensitive to carbs and feel sluggish) 159g protein 62g fat  Food sources:      chicken, beef, oily fish, broccoli, green beans, asparagus, green   leafy veg, blueberries, cauliflower, sweet potato, quinoa, brown rice,   almonds, eggs, cottage cheese, cheese, almond flour, banana, protein   shake, coconut oil, butter, flaxseed oil, coconut milk, flaxseed,   hempseed, chia seeds, other nuts and seeds, Greek yogurt, almond   butter, peanut butter   Supplements: psyllium husk, magnesium  Eating 6x a day  I lift 5 times a week in the evenings with 1 rest day and 1 active rest day (yoga/walking/circuit class).  I do HIIT hill sprints on 3 days of my 5 days of lifting. This consists of 5min warmup and cooldown walking on an incline and 5 rounds of 30sec sprint and 1.30min walking. Aiming to increase this to 10 rounds as my fitness increases.     Monday - Back. Deadlifts, rows, one arm DB rows, lat pulldowns,   standing cable lat pressdown + hill sprints      Tuesday - Quads and glutes. Squats, leg press, walking lunges,   bulgarian split squats. Abs. Hanging leg raises, mason twists, cable   crunches, plank.      Wednesday - Shoulders and arms. Standing barbell shoulder press, bicep   curl Arnold press, delt flys, front raises, lateral raises, hammer   curl, chinups, rope pulldowns, bent over tricep kickback, dips.   Followed by hill sprints      Thursday - chest and abs. Bench press, incline fly, pressups. Hanging   leg raises, mason twists, cable crunches, plank.      Friday - hamstrings and glutes. Romanian deadlifts, hip extensions,   glute bridges, good mornings, cable kickbacks + hill sprints   Saturday - active recovery  Sunday - rest  I do 4 sets with 10-12 reps with around 60s rest in between.  I need to get more sleep, currently average 7:20h a night. I have a desk job from 9am - 6pm but I walk 20min each way to work.  So far I have lost around 4lbs but this is probably just from increasing my water intake to ~4litres a day.  What do you think? Is this a reasonable regimen? "
907,Do high reps build strength?,"It is believed that high repetitions (more than 12) build muscle endurance and not strength, but to me this doesn't sound right, here's why,  let's suppose for example that i can curl 20 pounds for 5 reps,  then i choose to progress by increasing my reps instead of weight, therefore after some time i could curl 20 pounds for,  say,  15 reps. This means that i turned my 5 rep max into my 15 rep max,  so now my current 5 rep max had definitely increased, hence i built strength by using high reps. What's wrong with this reasoning? Is it the case that high reps build strength as well as low ones?  "
908,Organized run attire etiquette,"I am going to my first organized run.  I picked up the packet today.  It came with a t-shirt, and a number.  Should I show up wearing the shirt, with the number pinned to the front?  Or is the t-shirt for wearing after?  Also, I've thought about bringing my music and headphones, like I do when I run for exercise.  Some say I should not bring headphones at all (and that they might actually be banned, I'm just reading about it on running websites.)  Should I leave the music and phone at home, then? "
909,How to lose waist fat?,"I have been working out for 3 years and am in a good shape. My only problem is that I have extraordinary huge love handles and some belly fat that I can't seem to lose!  I workout in the morning 3-5 days a week. I have access to pool and I can do cardio. I've been on a diet for quite a long time, but I'm not losing the waist area fat. I'm 6 feet tall and weigh 93 kg. I'm planning to get to 87kg - 83kg, and people say I'm close to a mesomorphic body type.  What diet and workouts help the most in losing fat in the waist area (belly and love handles)?  Are there any foods that I need to stop or take more?  My current diet, which I've been on for diets 2 months and lost 8kg, is:   a mid-size plate of white oats with honey and nuts banana or an whole grain bar salad with tuna or salad with 2 chicken breasts apple or dates a chicken based meal or fish based around 2 beers a week   My workout, which also includes 15-30 minutes of swimming after each session, is:   Arms (7 workouts) + abs(2) Chest (5) Leg (6)+ abs(2) Back (6) Shoulders (4) + abs (2)   I switched to strength training last week. "
910,Strengthening and healing the psoas (leg-lifting) muscle,"A few months ago I hurt my psoas muscle and a couple of ligaments around it. I've been off of it since then and it's been healing and I'd like to get back into the things that I had to quit.   I'd like to know, how can I lower the chances or re-injuring it?   How can I stretch it out? (I'm not sure of the right stretch to accomplish this) How can I safely strengthen the muscle? Can I protect it by strengthening muscles around it, and what exercises should I do for this?   And anything else that'd help.  Additional Information: I hurt it by overworking it over time, slowly injuring it playing ultimate frisbee - lots of spriting and changing directions hard, so plenty of small yanks on the muscle without having warmed it up enough (that's my best guess). Now I'm not going back into frisbee but instead have started to do less strenuous activities. I started learning windmills (breakdancing move) and I think the psoas is being worked because I have to swing my legs to create momentum for the movement. "
911,How to find a weight lifting coach?,"What's the best way to find a good coach for weight lifting in my area?  The trainers in my gym seem to be very big &amp; strong, but not experts in form, or at least not know (at all) how to teach it.  I've gotten much more from this forum and from the Starting Strength book.  But I'd really like a good coach, so I can fine tune my form while I go higher.  The Starting Strength Coach Association didn't have anyone available in my area.  I don't need someone for every day - just occasionally to help with my form.  What's a good way to find a coach?  UPDATE: I see that there are many other coach certification programs around, like ACE NCSM etc, and some of these do have people listed in my area.  So, based on certifications, is there one which I'd expect can do good barbell training in the Starting Strength method? "
912,Getting fatter with weight training,"I am a 32 year old female who started weight training about 1 month ago after doing lots of cardio work. I really enjoy it and am building the weight slowly each week. I am also trying to move to a healthier diet to complement the workout. I suppose I have a couple of questions.  1) With the diet I have started to try protein shakes after the workout but am unsure whether this should be a substitute for my breakfast or whether I should be having both? An example of a day menu at the moment would be:   Up at half 6 and have some nuts or small amount of protein bar before 7am workout.  Protein shake about 8-8.30ish. Breakfast: (example) eggs and avocado or wholewheat bagel with a nut butter and banana Lunch: salad and some salmon or tuna Snack: apple or rice cake cake with some nut butter Dinner - Meat/fish with vegetables   And lots of water  2) I have found also that although I feel fitter and stronger, I am not noticing any results to look at and actually feel that I look fatter. Is this normal with the strength training or am I eating too much in an attempt to correctly eat?!  Any advice would be greatly received as new to this and don't know where to go for help! "
913,Do I have to push myself to the limit to burn enough calories?,"I'm extremely unfit and out of shape. I'm not super super fat, but I've been almost sedentary for a couple years now, so running is really hard for me.  I really don't enjoy being out of breath and uncomfortable, so instead of e.g. running on the treadmill, I will power walk. I find that if I try to run I usually run out of breath and have to stop.  Lately I've been wondering how it is that I know that I'm working hard enough. I have no idea how fast I should be walking or cycling or whatever. I'm using a mix of the treadmill, stationary bike, elliptical and cross trainer. I feel that maybe you have to really push yourself and get sweating to be burning calories. Should I be getting to the point where I'm out of breath? Am I going to burn fat by power walking?   Sorry if this is a stupid question. "
914,Overstretching to increase flexibility,"I attend regular martial arts classes (about 3-4 a week).  We spend a lot of time stretching, particularly the hip area and the legs, to increase flexibility.  Often after some classes where we do a lot of stretching, I find that the muscles/other soft tissues I don't know the name of/tendons I stretched are pretty sore.  Is this a normal reaction to increasing flexibility?  Should I view the soreness as evidence I'm becoming more flexible, or should I ease up a bit?  EDIT: The general location of the soreness is the hip, psoas area (I'll try to roust up a picture later).  It usually fades after a couple days, some ice/heat application speeds recovery.  I have as yet not noticed any marked improvement in flexibility. "
915,What is the proper form when lowering the barbell?,"I'm taking a look here at this video:  [website]Specifically this frame:    It appears he lets it drop with no voluntary tightening of the muscles while it's in descent. When I do this, I tense up my muscles and resist the descent as it drops to the ground in my hands. I think that if I were to do it like this person, I would start to develop some socket pain from just letting it jerk like this.  I thought learning shin-to-knee, knee-to-hip, hip-to-breast, breast-drop-to-overhead was it, but no, the descent is important too, no? I want to get it right.  Dropping the bar, IMO, seems less athletic. "
916,Is sitting cross legged good for anterior pelvic tilt?,"i have some APT and associated knee clicking (the latter being the main issue). I believe i got this from cycling/muscle imbalances and lack of stretching. To try and cure this i've been doing strengthening exercises for the glutes and abs,and stretching the hip flexors,groin, calves and piriformis. My goal has been to try and rotate my femurs externally to stop my knee caps clicking on the outer leg. I've read that sitting cross legged stretches the piriformis (good), but would it also stretch the glutes etc and make APT worse ? So basically is sitting cross legged good for helping cure APT and achieving some external femur rotation?  "
917,How to train for leg explosive power?,One of my physical test requirements are standing broad jumps.  What methods are there to train for standing broad jumps or leg explosive power in general? And which precautions do I have to take so that I do not injure my knees or my back as I land? 
918,How to improve half marathon pace?,"I am a slow runner averaging about 7 min/km. I run 2-3 times every week with a weekly mileage of 20-24 kms. I plan to sign up for a few HMs this summer and I am targeting a sub 2:30 hours finish time.   I know there are a lot of training plans available on the web, but is there some program which can significantly help in increasing pace? Do any of you have personal experience by following a plan?  I am a fan of the Gallloway style of running and I do run/walk in intervals.  "
919,Bulking with cardio?,"I've been gyming for around three and a half months now. Started when I was 123 lbs and have gained significant weight, 141 lbs to be exact. Height is 5'9. Been eating a lot of calories obviously. I lift heavy and workout five times a week, 1 hour maximum. Q1. Any particular reason for this rapid weight gain or is it normal? Q2. Plus my tummy is getting out too in the process, is cardio recommended during the bulking phase, if yes, how much? Since most of the trainers recommend to wait for the cutting phase to incorporate the any sort of cardio. "
920,What are the nutritional benefits of saturated fats?,"From this answer it was stated     saturated don't do you any favors,   whereas polyunsaturated fats have been   shown to decrease risk of heart   disease and stroke   Are there any health benefits to consuming saturated fats? Or should they always be avoided in favor of polyunsaturated fats? Is there a health/nutritional downside to never consuming saturated fats?  I'm thinking fats from dairy, meat, bacon, eggs, etc.  Edit  So I've got two completely opposite answers. I'm really not savvy enough to tell the difference to pick the best answer... Help me out by posting more answers, commenting, upvoting/downvoting. "
921,How and when to consume a protein shake properly?,"I was just reading this question about drinking water during/after meals.  And one of the answerers, Greg, made a comment that drinking enough water can cause the plug at the bottom of the stomach to open.  Which essentially explains why taking pills on an empty stomach works the way it does.  My question has to do with ISO Whey Protein, which is supposed to be refined for quick absorption.  I drink 60 grams of the protein powder mixed with milk.  So if I drink this on an empty stomach it will go right into the intestines correct as it will force the plug at the bottom of the stomach to open.  So the question is: Should I be drinking this protein drink on an empty stomach and should I sip it or is downing it in a few gulps okay? I usually drink it first thing in the morning mixed with creatine? "
922,"Any solid reasoning behind the fitness regime: 1 set, as many reps as possible?","I recently signed up for a new gym closer to where I live. Together with the signup they were offering structuring a workout schedule with a personal trainer, which I gladly took. After talking about my goals for training and any old injuries, I was told that their general policy with overall workouts is one set and as many reps as possible though at least 10-12 reps, and increasing the weight next session once 12 reps is not tough anymore.   I have to say I was quite unsure about this regime, so I asked the trainer about if they had any reason for recommending this regime and was told that the advice is based on shorter but intensive sessions and is a company policy that is recommended nationally (it's a large company that have gyms overall in the country).   I wonder if there is any physiological reason behind this regime being superior to the usual/conventional 3 set with 12-15 reps? Have you been recommended this regime at some point? If you have followed a similar regime, how does it compare to more conventional regimes? I should note that my goals for workout is recovering from weakness that some old injuries have left as well as my sedentary life style causes, as well as generally getting in better shape. "
923,Working Biceps and Triceps the next day after Chest and Back,"Majority of the people don't recommend working out biceps and triceps the day after chest and back, the primary reason being that your biceps and triceps get a little bit of burn during the chest and back workout and they may be sore and might not have fully recovered. Ideally, I would insert a leg/shoulder day in between those muscles but my schedule doesn't always guarantee that. My question is: Is it possible that biceps and triceps gets fatigued so much during chest and back that they require more than 24 hours to recover? Is it advisable if I go ahead working these muscles on consecutive days keeping in mind the complexity of my schedule? PS: I've been gyming since 3 and a half months, I weigh 141 lbs, 5'9 height and lift moderate to heavy weight, in bulking phase. "
924,How do I know if I am using my resistance cord in the right way?,"I have a new set of Resistance cord that I bought. I am exercising regularly with it, but then how do I know if I am using it in the correct way?    Let us say that I am doing the squat with it.    I am not sure if I am having an equal length of the cord on each side (from my hand to feet). If they are not of equal length on both sides, does that mean that I am exercising wrongly and thereby building uneven muscles on each side? If so, then how do I hold even lengths on each side? "
925,Is this pain in my neck -- after Smith Machine squats -- just DOMs or something else?,"Last Thursday (so, 5 days ago), I did a short leg workout, centering on finding my maximum weight for squats. I used a Smith Machine and, for the first time ever, I did not have a pad on the Olympic bar, as my gym only has one pad and someone else had it. I only had a small towel to pad the bar and no training partner that day to watch me to make sure I wasn't rolling the bar up my neck as I squatted down (a form problem I have). I don't remember the bar rolling up, but I fear it might have, because of this pain in my neck and shoulders (specific muscles feel like they are traps, the splenius muscles, rhomboid minor -- that whole area).   The pain itself is an achy type, not sharp or shooting. The feeling led me to ask my partner if he saw any black &amp; blue marks on the area. He said no. But if he'd said yes, I'd not have been surprised, because it feels like I've been thumped around there. It's an odd achy feel that I'm not used to getting after squatting.  I'm a hair's breath shy of being an outright hypochondriac, so I don't feel that I have actually sustained an acute injury. If I had any thought at all that I'd seriously hurt myself, I'd have been at the doctor's in a shot. But, short of a keen injury, what could I have done? And what should I do to alleviate these aches and pains? Should I just ice/rest for a while? work through it to 'loosen it up'? Is this just DOMs -- (it's been suggested by a friend that maybe I was actually hefting the heaviest weights up with my shoulders a bit, recruiting muscles I shouldn't have)? Or something else? Should I be concerned or not fuss too much and move on?  Just never experienced anything like this before.  "
926,Is a high heart rate a sign to be concerned of?,"Does a high heartrate indicate bad health / unfitness? I have a 80~85 BPM at resting state and it seems unusually high compared to the average. I don't exercise often, but I'm not necessary fat either - I'm 5""8 at 155 pounds.   Should I be concerned? If yes, what can I do to lower my BPM? "
927,Good breakfast to regain concentration and energy after a morning workout?,I work as a programmer. Recently I've been going to the gym downstairs and doing half an hour of pretty intensive rowing before work every day. The problem is that I feel completely wiped out afterwards. I usually have a big bowl of healthy cereal afterwards - but I don't feel like it's giving me what I need to regain my concentration back and feel unable to concentrate properly until I eat lunch.   I drink lots of water too - what am I missing? salt? What's the right thing to eat in the morning for this? Or do I need a supplement?  
928,Is growth of a muscle limited to the size of the opposing muscle?,"I've read and heard from several bodybuilders (Arnold, big Youtube guys) that the pectorals will only grow in proportion to the upper lats. Both must be trained equally to see growth.    What is the scientific explanation for this? How do the muscle fibers in the pecs know how the muscle fibers in the back are doing?  Does this rule apply to all pairs of opposing muscles?    Granted, the pecs and upper lats are not mechanically opposing, but are physically placed opposite of each other. Examples of other opposing muscles include bicep/tricep, quads/hamstrings, tibialis anterior/gastrocneumus. Arnold said that the tricep should be two-thirds of the upper arm to be aesthetically pleasing, so the proportion requirement could not always be 1:1 for all muscle pairs. He said that was an aesthetic requirement, not a physical requirement, but this doesn't rule out that a minimum physical requirement of some other proportion exists. "
929,Is it normal to crave for lemons after running,"About 1-2 hours after running yesterday evening, I was cooking some salsa in my kitchen.   When adding some lemon juice to the salsa I suddenly had a craving for the lemon and basically  ate half a lemon.  Is this craving caused by the running? If so, does it indicate that my body was missing some kind of nutrition, that it was hoping to get from the lemon? "
930,When do you recommend using a belt for deadlifts?,"I've been trying to dead lift heavier (up to 380), but seem to have reached a plateau...the biggest obstacles seem to be my grip strength (thinking of using straps) and pressure on the lower back.  Is it time to use a belt? what are the drawbacks to using one? and should I just put it on when I get to the heavy sets? "
931,Stepping down safely for knee,"I had some knee injury while doing a one-legged squat a while ago.  Now, I can comfortably step up, but stepping down stairs is a big problem.  While stepping down, how should I orient my torso to minimize stress on my knee? Do I bend it forward, or backward?  Forward will increase pressure on knee, but backward will increase torque, right? "
932,How to increase rotator cuff activation on pull-up?(Weighted Pull-Up or Bodyweight Pull-Up),I am wondering about how to increase my rotator cuff activation on pull-up exercise?I think these following practises increase my rotator cuff activation on pull-up.  -Wide Grip  -Weighted pull-up with low reps or bodyweight pull up with high reps? 
933,How to lose only belly fat in 2 weeks,"Me: I am 191cm 71kg.  I am fairly defined except my stomach.  My training: I currently do heavy free weight sessions 4 times a week:  chest, back/arms, legs and shoulders/arms.  My diet: High protein/medium carb diet of mainly turkey, fish, rice, potatoes and eggs.  No protein shakes (allergic).  I am going on holiday in 2 weeks and would like my stomach to look its best and it currently does not look great due to some bad eating.  So basically I want to drop as much fat on my stomach as is possible without loosing existing muscle tissue and am willing to work for it.  From the internet I have read interval workouts on treadmill/cross trainer and eliminating all carbs.  Does anyone have any ideas how to achieve this and fast?  Should I take a break from weight training altogether or just add interval training or what? "
934,How long after a long run can one (body weight) exercise?,"Is it a good idea to engage in relatively heavy session of upper body + core calisthenics (read, push-ups/pull-ups/chin-ups) about 12 hours after a long run (10k+) - assuming one is feeling fine and not exhausted, but heart rate still a bit high?   If not, how much gap is ideal? Should one wait till the heart rate comes completely back to normal?  "
935,Why is my outer hip tight when doing some inner thigh stretches?,"Bound angle pose (pictured below) is supposed to stretch the inner thigh muscles and groin, but I can't even get to the point of feeling anything in in those areas because something in my outer hips is so tight it prevents me from getting my knees down toward the floor.    In a wide angle seated forward bend (pictured below), on the other hand, I do feel the stretch in my inner thighs, and it doesn't affect my outer hips.    I do yoga frequently and the tension in my outer hip has persisted. It's much tighter on my right side than on my left, so I worry about it causing imbalance-related problems in my body.  Which muscle is causing the tension? Are there any stretches that will actually increase its flexibility (standard yoga poses haven't seemed to help). Unilateral stretches would be better so I can focus more on the right side.    Here's a visual of where I feel the tension. I realize the position of tension corresponds to the gluteus medius, but that muscle shouldn't be stretched in these positions... should it?   "
936,Does lifting more than 5lbs really cause females to bulk?,"I recently read an article about a guy who trains many models and actresses and he states that women shouldn't be lifting weights above 5 pounds, and not doing cardio such as spinning, because doing so will cause you to look bigger:     None of the classes use dumbbells heavier than three to five pounds. ""I think that what we always try to achieve is a long, lean, toned body,"" Kirsch explains. ""Models don't want to look jacked. When they’re in a bra and panties, we want to make sure nothing jiggles.""   Is there truth to his claims? What are the scientific facts? Is there anything correct about the idea that lifting weights heavier than 5lbs is inappropriate for women? "
937,What should one do in case of whey protein allergy?,"I've been using a whey protein concentrate by an Indian brand named Muscleblaze. I had been reading reviews from the internet that one should shift to American protein brands as they have a better quality control during the manufacturing process and the product is much better.  I switched to Muscletech and I took their whey protein concentrate. I left that protein because it had 2.5 gms of creatine mixed with every scoop. I usually develop bloating if I take creatine, even if in small amounts. Then I read about the reviews of MyProtein on the website labdoor. I bought their protein concentrate. I really loved the protein, especially with milk. But I started encountering an upset stomach and flatulence. I tried taking it without milk too, but I had similar problems, although less.  I don't understand what's wrong. I'm unable to supplement protein through food as I'm a student eating at a mess. I don't understand why should I encounter this problem after switching to a supposedly better product. Are such things typically encountered for whey protein users? Have I developed some disease? Should I try some other brand or switch back to my previous one? "
938,"Does muscle really ""turn into"" fat?","You often hear people say ""My muscle turned into fat"" to explain why they used to be strong and in shape but now they are on the somewhat rotund side.  My question is how does that transition actually happen?  Do your muscle fibers really ""turn into"" fat in any way, or is it only the slow decrease of muscle through lack of use, and increase of fat through bad eating habits? "
939,Difference between cutting calories and cardio (with regard to fat loss)?,"Whenever someone says they are looking to lose weight or burn fat, the universal answer seems to be diet+cardio. I myself am guilty of always recommending people get on a cardio program in addition to telling them to get on a proper diet. However, when it comes down to it, is there really any difference between dieting and cardio?  I understand that both cardio and dieting have alternative benefits (i.e. better metabolism, more balanced nutrition, etc.), but when specifically focusing on the goal of weight loss, is there any tangible difference between the two? In my mind, a calorie deficit will cause the same amount of weight loss whether it came from decreasing calorie intake (diet) or increasing calorie expenditure (cardio).  So am I missing something fundamental here that would explain why combined cardio+diet is always the go to plan, when either individual plan could also produce identical results? "
940,"How and what to drink for 30 min to 1 hour runs, avoiding the marketing hype","From a different question I learned that I probably need more electrolytes during running. I currently run 30minutes in one go, possibly increasing that in the future to up to an hour.  So far I drank some water before running and lots of water afterwards.  How can I improve on that, i.e. what should I drink? I'd like to avoid the expensive sports drink with lots of marketing and replace it with something I can make at home from more or less natural ingredients (water, juices, salt ...).  I also would like some advice on how to drink? Is drinking before and after enough? If not how do you carry your drink? Just a bottle in the hand, or a backpack with water? "
941,Best way of eating after exercise for reducing belly fat,"I have much large belly fat as compared to upper body. Daily i do weight training (45min to 1 hr) + cardiovascular (45 min). I want to make upper body muscles , simultaneoulsy want to reduce my large belly.  The questions   1 . Do different workouts require different diets?  2 . How long should I wait with eating after an exercise?  3 . Duration between workout and dinner  The answers on above questions have made me confused to wheather take diet just after excercise or wait for long in order to reduce belly. "
942,"Strength training: what to do when it becomes kind of easy, in order to keep improving","I've been training for several years, stopped for a while then started back but kept working out regularly (4-6 days a week) for the past 2 years.  I lift heavy weight, do bodyweight training, skip rope, explosive workout (burpees for example) and eat quality food with a controlled diet.  However lately i just don't feel any pain, sore muscles, or any kind of challenge while working out.   What do you peeps do when you reach this phase, in order to keep improving (shredding more fat, adding more muscles)? I know that adding more weight usually helps and that's what i do , but what could possibly be done other than that?(change of diet, resting for few weeks, new workouts..etc..) "
943,Why do muscle gain articles focus on total calories rather than protein for skinny high metabolism body types?,"A lot of articles on the internet suggest to up the calories intake to gain muscle mass, especially if you are a skinny body type with high metabolism.   I am confused, because aren't muscles grown from proteins only? So my guess is that you intake random calories, so your body burns them for general energy consumption, and on the top of that it uses proteins to repair muscle fibers that have been damaged during training. Do I have that right?   I need to understand what those articles mean and why, so I could calculate my calories and protein intake correctly. "
944,"What's the exact effect of this training regime? (12-15 reps, 30s - 1min break, 3 sets)","That's the regime I was advised at my gym: 12-15 reps per set - maybe less on the last set 30s - 1min break between sets,  3 sets  weights are adjusted so that this is doable, but not by much  What does this do in terms of training effect, is this a regime for max strength, muscle mass or what? Inside of those parameters, what does a variation do?  I limit myself to 30 sec. break between sets, and do 15 reps each set. Suppose I adjust the weights upwards, so that 15 reps on the last set are no longer in my reach - what would that achieve?  What does the speed with which I execute one rep do to the result?  In case that is relevant to an answer, my training goal is general fitness and strength, I'm not keen on looking especially bulky or ripped.  edited to add, 2.7.12: I just want to add that after some time of sticking to that program I only noticed (small) improvements in muscles I didn't work out before. In the past I had greater success with bodyweight exercises "
945,Increase Anaerobic Energy Levels,"I am trying to increase the amount of sprinting and cutting that I can do consecutively without getting burned out.  I recently started a tough workout program/plan that has me doing jumps and lunges followed immediately by sprints with little down time in between reps. The ""little"" downtime turned into ""more"" downtime because I couldn't keep the pace up.   What's the best way to increase my anaerobic energy levels so I can increase my intensity and decrease my recovery time?  I'm 25, if that makes a difference.  Edit: I should also add that I am 6'2"", 190lbs and have been very active my whole life.  I think what I am looking for is some general information on anaerobic endurance, anaerobic recovery and how to improve them./Edit  Edit: I know how to pace my self as a distance runner, so I know what my aerobic energy levels can sustain over various distances. All of the exercises in this program surpass the levels that I can sustain continuously. How can I teach my body to recover quickly so I can surpass my aerobic levels repeatedly and then recover very, very quickly?/Edit "
946,How to train musculation during a fasting period?,"I've just finished my first musculation session. But I am a little bit affraid about my diet in a futur period, In 2 months, I'll not be able to eat till night during one month, so no breakfast, no lunch and dinner will be at about 22:00 (night).   I am aware that it is not good, specially in period of bulk, but how to train, what to eat in this month ? Should I eat and train more now and make this special month to be as if it is a cut period ? "
947,How can a vegetarian ectomorph put on lean muscle mass?,"I know there has already been a question relating protein to vegetarianism, but the answers mostly speculated on whether it was possible for vegetarians to get enough protein.    Which kind of diet should I adopt, keeping my vegetarianism, that would allow me to put on muscle mass? And is there a workout routine designed with hypertrophy in mind.  I've done StrongLifts, I've done Starting Strength, but I think I've reached a plateau when it comes to body mass.    I will drink a gallon of whole milk a day for a week, put on 5 pounds, and within two days, I'm back to my starting weight.  What am I to do? "
948,Muscles shorten when working out - why do I feel this most strongly in the lower back?,"When I follow the normal routine of my gym including stretching after the workout, I strongly feel a shortening of my lower back muscle, to the point where I have a distinct hollow back after working out.  I don't know the english name of the exercise for the lower back, but basically I lie on a platform inclined at roughly 45°, tilt my torso downward till the angle torso-legs is 90° or a bit smaller, and up again.  I do (as advised) 15 reps, 3 sets, that's barely doable for me.  I concentrate strongly on my lower back when stretching after exercise, doing stuff I've seen in yoga or pilates, but I still have a stronger hollow back after a workout (or at least it feels like that).  Why is this so? Any advices to avoid long term trouble?  edited to add/clarify: My subjective feeling is that the lower back muscles are shorter (and don't have that feeling that strongly with other muscle) and I see that it affects my posture. "
949,Are there reasons you shouldn't do plyometrics workouts barefoot?,"As a follow up to this question and answer, are there any reasons why I shouldn't perform a plyometrics workout barefoot? I've tried both, and I definitely feel more stress on my feet when barefoot, but I'm able to catch the floor better on jumps, and I imagine that over time my feet will adapt. Is the extra stress to the joints (assuming there is any) significant? "
950,Exercising deficit and daily caloric intake,"Hi I'm a 28 year old female, 153cm (5'), 54kg (120lb).  I'm am trying to lose some weight and tone up.  I am currently eating around 1300 calories a day, working out on a rowing machine and cycling machine, and burning approximately 350 calories.  Should I be eating more even though I'm trying to lose weight?  I have been told: I'm only eating enough, my caloric intake is too little and consuming 1300 calories is dangerous.   Should I be eating 1300 calories and burning 1300?  How many calories should I be eating to lose weight while on a work out program? What should I do? "
951,Long term effects of various constipation treatments?,"Okay, so I think constipation might be relevant in this site because it's sort of related to nutrition, but..  One of the treatments to get rid of constipation is by using laxatives. However, I've heard that long-term uses of them are not desired, and can have detrimental effects.  What about suppositories? From what I've heard, they just soften up the stool on the spot, so would it be fair to assume that there's not much to worry about in terms of long-term effects? "
952,Where does protein come from if muscles are built and repaired at night?,"I've been wondering for a while where protein to build muscle comes from?   If I consume protein throughout the day and that protein is pretty much digested and processed within an hour or two of consumption. But most muscle building happens while at rest, how does the protein I consumed at 5:00pm make it to bed time? "
953,RunDisney: Inappropriate Corral Management,"Anyone that has run an organized running event has dealt with the weaving in and out of slower starters that insist on pushing to the front.  It's illogical for most events as they are chip-timed when you cross the starting line, and flat-out rude.  In larger events the weaving could last the whole time.    The Disney runs (half marathon and above) attempt to somewhat relieve this as you are put into starting corrals based times in other running events that must be provable online.  Sure, there will be some attempts at cheating this, but there seems to be a systemic organization to slow runners starting first.  A coworker started a Disney marathon in corral C, elite is A, B is very fast.  He even started at the beginning of C, and still passed an obese man walking the marathon.  And several other slow runners.  How did they get there?  My wife ran the Princess half, and I was shocked at the slow runners that were walking only a half mile into the race.  She spent the whole race weaving in and out of people and added over one mile to her race because of the sideways running (based on the Apple watch and ""Map My Run"" on her phone).  The most troubling thing is that there were several groups of run-walkers that seemed to be organized by Disney.  These groups were large (over 50 people) and were led by a person carrying a sign advertising the goal pace.  Despite their pace being significantly slower than my wife's, the whole group got to start ahead of her.  The fastest of the group she passed was going at a pace a half hour slower than hers.  How is that reasonable?  Passing these large groups can be very problematic as they tend to take up the whole road.    So my question is do you thing there is a systemic problem with RunDisney's corral placement?  Can a person just pay to be put in an earlier corral? "
954,how many high intensity interval training (HIIT) schedules can/should I do per week?,"I am currently training for marathons (half &amp; full) coming up in quick successions. My best is 1 hr 44 min for a half marathon. I haven't attempted the full marathon yet. But I have got the endurance to do it because I have done up to 3/4 Ironman.   Right now I am doing only one HIIT session in a week. I do up to 5 cardios (mainly running, sometimes cycling) in a week. I strengthen my muscles (calisthenics or using resistance ropes) before or after every cardio session.  In the HIIT, I warm up (jog, 900 - 1000 m) for 5 minutes. Sprint 200 m in 35 s &amp; jog 200 m in 70 - 80 s and I repeat them 4 or 5 times. Then again cool down jog (800 m - 1000 m) for another 5 min.  Now my question is how many times can I do this in a week? If I use the HIIT (eg: Tabata Protocol) for strengthening, not the same day as HIIT run schedule, is that considered as a separate HIIT session? Keeping in mind the recovery run schedules(0 - 1 session after the HIIT) and the Long distance schedules (I do once a week), can anyone guide me?    By the way my age is 25. My resting heart rate ranges between 55 and 60. "
955,Trying different protein powders for taste,"I'd like to try different flavours of protein powders to see which one better suits my taste. However, almost all those sold in shops/online weigh at least 500g, often 1kg or more. Which makes it impossible to try more than 2 or 3 without spending a lot of money and possibly wasting a lot of powder.  How do people actually do it in practice? Do they just try their luck and hope they'll like it? Are there sample bags of miscellaneous flavors with a small amount of each that can be bought? Or do shops offer small amounts for you to try?  (I didn't see any of that at Holland &amp; Barrett, and I didn't go to any gyms, either, in case that's relevant.) "
956,BMR+Harris-benedict equation: case of negative output,"I was using the BMR and Harris benedict equations. I got a  negative  result when i used the following information just by curiosity:   Age: 80 Height :1feet 0 inches (ie 12 inches)  weight :22 pounds Gender: male Activity level-->little or no exercise :  BMR x 1.2   Then using the formulas at the mentionned links:  Men: BMR = 66 + ( 6.23 x weight in pounds ) + ( 12.7 x height in inches ) - ( 6.8 x age in year )   ==&gt; BMR = -188.54    ==&gt; Energy needs = BMR * activity level = -188.54 * 1.2 = -226.248   I know the information are probably not common (80 years old, 1feet 0 inch, 22 pounds), but what does it mean when you get a negative BMR and a negative Energy need?  I did not try all possible cases where u might have a negative value (For negative, it is in general required: left side &lt; right side where right side is ( 6.8 x age in year ) ) but if let's say a nutritionist is using this formula on a client and gets a negative result what do they do? "
957,How does the cyclic-ketogenic diet allow weight loss and muscle gain?,"The common notion is that in order to gain muscle you must be a ""calorie surplus"", and in order to burn fat/lose weight you must be a in a ""calorie deficit. However the cyclic-ketogenic diet claims that it allows muscle building AND fat loss? How is this possible and what is the mechanism behind it? Since surely you cannot be in a surplus and deficit at the same time? "
958,What do I write on a program schedule?,"I have a program that looks like this:    Roughly, it's a leg day, arm day and cardio day. It was put together for me as part of the ""bonus PT sessions"" on joining a gym.  What would one normally write in the boxes on the program? Is it simply a tick to keep track of each date you did it, or would you normally keep track of how long each set takes and try to decrease it? "
959,Influence of hand position on squatting,"I am familiar with two positions to keep the hands when doing body weight squats, either in front of your body with arms straight forward or slightly bent or behind the neck.  Does this make a difference? Does it make any difference at all where my hands are at when squatting? Why not just let the arms hang down the sides? "
960,Are ninja tuck jumps safe?,"I recently stumbled upon a exercise called ""ninja tuck jumps"" as shown in this article: 25 Most Deceiving Exercises - Ninja Tuck Jumps  See also these videos:   Ninja jump with a tuck jump Zuzana Light - ZWOW # 21   Is this exercise safe? How high is the risk of injury doing this exercise, how high is the risk to damage something in long term doing this?  I should add that I am in very good shape and it's not a problem for me to do this, however I just have the feeling that it might be not safe. Are there any form pointers for this type of exercise to make it safer? "
961,How can I fit 7 weeks of C25K training into two weeks?,"I signed up for a 5k mud run a few weeks ago, and started a C25K program.... at which point I realized it's a 10 week program and I only had 4 weeks to train!    So I've got two weeks left, and I could barely handle the week two runs (2 minutes running, 1 minute walking.)    My biggest problem is my shins/calves being super tight and getting sore/stiff after about the 3rd round of running.  It's gotten better... but not getting better fast enough.  So basically I'm wondering if running every day would be beneficial or not?  Also wondering what other exercises would help... I don't have a bike.  I do have a gym membership though, and they have a pool.  So maybe alternate running days with swimming?   "
962,When should I use incline and speed intervals versus incline and speed ramps?,"I have access to a treadmill that has speed workouts and incline workouts. There are two types of each - intervals and ramps. In an interval, it alternates between a resting speed or resting incline and a working speed or working incline, with each interval being 1-2 minutes. In a ramp, the speed or incline starts low and increases to a maximum about half way through the workout and then starts to decrease. There's also a combination ramp that changes both speed and incline through the duration of the workout.  I'm guessing that there's no one best choice - there are benefits to intervals and benefits to ramps. I typically do two treadmill workouts a week - one focusing on speed and one focusing on inclines. I'll do other easy runs or long runs on a treadmill if the weather is bad (or it's winter) or I'm crunched for time.  I found some information about speed versus incline intervals and the merits of both, but it doesn't discuss speed and incline ramps where the whole workout is a build up followed by a decrease. Another article mentions ""hill training"" for use if outdoor areas tend to be flat (which is true for me), which sounds like incline ramp, but doesn't compare it to intervals. Another article talks about general benefits of incline training. Finally, there are many articles which suggest that you should have an incline of about 1% on a treadmill if you are training to run outdoors.  How can I decide if I should do an interval or a ramp? My instinct is that I should mix them up, but I'm not sure if I should favor one or the other.  Should I continue to separate speed and incline workouts or should I tend toward the ramp that increases both speed and incline? "
963,Resistance training and avoiding chronic injury: are squat/deadlift/bench safe?,"My number one priority with resistance training is minimising the risk of chronic damage to my body over decades of lifting weights. I have found lots of conflicting information on this, and a lack of good empirical studies on the main compound lifts. I'm not interested in going very heavy with these movements: 1.5x bodyweight with squats and deadlifts and 1x bodyweight with bench press.  On the one hand there are many who believe that doing back squats, conventional deadlifts, and bench presses, in this weight range, poses no real long term risk as long as you pay enough attention to your form. On the other hand, there are some who say that the movements will damage your joints/tissues/cartilage over time and it's better to substitute them for other movements, even though they may be less efficient.  For example with squats: the conventional wisdom is that if you keep your spine erect and upright then the force applied is compressive, not shear, which your disks are good at dealing with. On the other hand, links like this and this argue that back squats lead to forward lean/hyperextension all too often, which significantly increases the chance of back issues if repeated over a period of decades during one's lifetime.  The second link makes similar points for many major lifts and advocates substitute exercises that would be less efficient but safer. For example, squats could be swapped for bulgarian split squats and single leg presses; deadlifts for dumbbell single leg reverse deadlifts.   I guess my actual question comes in two parts:  1) If I swapped the conventional barbell lifts for the variants I mentioned above, would that come with a lower risk of long term damage to my body? (Back, joints, etc).  2) If I swapped for these exercises, would it still be possible to build a moderate level of strength and muscle [enough that I could still squat and deadlift 1.5x my bodyweight if I wanted to], even if it's over a longer period of time? "
964,Getting back in shape after being bedridden for 4 months,"Background:I have suffered a severe shoulder injury, and have therefore been completely bedridden the last four months. This has resulted in some extra kilos around my belly, enough to make me look like a stuffed sausage in some of my clothes. Under normal circumstances I would consider myself an athlete (I did an Ironman, a marathon and a few long bike races last year). I've never had problems getting in good shape fast, but this time everything goes much slower.  Current status: Due to the shoulder injury, there are a few exercises I can't do (for instance running, swimming and pushups).   Until now, (after the injury), I've been riding my bicycle trainer for 30-60 minutes (approx. 30 km/h, 180 rpm, 80% of max HR), followed by a three sets of 30 crunches, 60 sec plank, and 10 reps with the superman. In the end I do my mandatory shoulder exercises (resistance band for the rotator cuff, something like this).  The time I have available is 60 minutes three times and 90 minutes once a week.  Question: Is there something I can change, in order to loose some belly weight faster, not including dieting (I have found a lot of information about this already). I'm pretty much restricted to the exercises I mentioned above, so it's mainly a question of intensity, order, number of repetitions etc.  Would it be better to do intervals on the bike? Lower intensity? Or maybe mix it up: 10 minutes with high intensity on the trainer, then one set of core exercises, 10 minutes on the trainer etc.?     Note 1: I know it's not possible to reduce the fat percentage on one body part alone. However, my belly is the only place I have (visible) fat. My arms are skinny and my legs are well-trained.   Note 2: I have no problems with motivation.  Note 3: I do not have a gym membership.  Note 4: My BMI is exactly 25, so I'm not ""overweight"". The problem is that all the kilos are on my belly. "
965,How often can a person work on their Abs?,"In the past I've heard Abs are different from other muscle groups.  You can work on your Abs everyday, but then I've also heard, Abs are like any other muscle groups.  It needs rest for recovery.  So, my question is, how often can you work on your Abs?  Can it be a daily routine or should you work on it every other day?  What's the best rest day/days between each Abs session?  Would like to achieve sculpted Abs with rock hard core.  EDIT: To clarify, I have a set weekly workout routine, but am looking for peak performance specifically targeting my Abs.  Also, I have a strict healthy diet currently and looking to improve it as well.  I am looking for that extra boost into the 6-8 pack Abs. "
966,Cycling speed and fitness,"I have a number of health issues (including heart) but love cycling and am determined to train for a long distance ride. I am 68 years old and a beginning cyclist. I have worked up to a distance of 20kms at an average speed of 10-12 km per hour, which feels as though I am really pushing myself, especially if there is wind. My question is: Is it possible for me to improve on this speed over time and with more riding practice? If so, how would you recommend I proceed? "
967,How to stay fit on vacation?,"I am doing CrossFit on a regular basis. However, this summer I will be on a 4-week-long vacation.   I have seen this question: What&#39;s a good exercise regime for when traveling/vacationing/etc.? and this one: What kind of cardio exercises can be performed without a gym or fitness equipment?, the latter recommending this list of Body Weight Workouts.   However, not only do I expect to have no access to fitness equipment, but doing pull-ups, muscle-ups, etc. will be challenging without a rack of some sort.   What types of exercises should I perform to stay at least somewhat in shape while traveling? Especially considering the broad nature of CrossFit (I am looking to do more than ""just"" jogging). "
968,Running-101: For beginners who would like to give up smoking,"I am a computer science major. All I do is stay seated and code, 24/7, which made me a nocturnal,obnoxious, and anti-social creature. I want to make a change in my sedentary lifestyle.  I want to run on a regular basis and make it a habit. To note, I'm a heavily caffeinated creature and I smoke a wide range of stuff. I tried running a couple of times and I run out of breath. However, each time I run, I feel so exuberant and my inclination to smoking and cigarettes get exceptionally reduced.   I want to get rid of smoking, run each morning, but perhaps I could never get rid of coffee. My question is, after getting all in-depth context about me, how long and how often should I run? Each day? What time? Early in the morning? Without or with breakfast? How long? 30 minutes? 1 hour? I live in a school that's on a mountain.I enjoy walking quietly but now I want to enjoy running quietly.   "
969,Squats: Should your knees never go past your toes?,"   Possible Duplicate:   What is the key to avoid injury when squatting with your body weight?       I've heard that when you are doing squats, your knees should not go past your toes. However, two hundred squats, is telling me that I should go down until my legs are parallel to the ground. I can't go parallel without my knees going past my toes. Should I stop my knees going past my toes, or should I go all the way down? "
970,Best protocol for self assisted pull-ups?,"I can't do full body weight pull ups, so I do self assisted ones. I try to follow the form described on exrx.  I have a few questions that are probably linked, so I ask them as one:   What is the best speed? On exrx, the lady takes about two seconds for one full rep (up + down). When I concentrate on pulling with my arms/shoulders mostly, I take about ten seconds. When I do it faster, I can't concentrate on my arms so much. What's better? How should I organize my workout? Should I count reps, or go for time, or a hybrid or what? Either way, I can't guarantee that all reps will be equal as during the set or from set to set, my arms/back become weaker and my legs do more.  How can I track progress? I have a strong on-off relationship with training, so I want something that allows me to track progress to keep me motivated, also I want to be sure I don't stall.  "
971,Does long distance running prevent muscle/strength gain?,"I've read at Mark Rippetoe's website that a long distance running is where catabolic process prevail, and muscle/strength gain is where anabolic process prevail.  Therefore, they should somehow impede each other. The organism can adapt and become good at one thing at a time: either strength or endurance. But that's just a speculation.  What's going on in reality?  Looks like triathletes are both good in endurance and in strength and they have pretty good hypertrophy of muscles. So, is the concept above wrong? "
972,Totally ditching chest training,"What are the implications and negative side effects of NOT training the chest muscles?  I train my entire body from the jaw and neck down to the feet but I'm thinking on making the pectoral muscles the only exception.  My reasoning: I personally see no point  in training the chest mostly for two reasons. 1 the chest adds little to no thickness or width to your body, one can perfectly have a big frame with bony chest . 2 The chest can only be seen  when naked so only your girlfriend will ever know if you have a small or big chest, just like abs but training your core has a point as it makes all lifts easier while chest training can even worsen your posture.  My actual routine, i switch variations periodically...some times i completelly change exercises but the muscles worked remain the same.  It may look long but i superset everything, I only stay 1 hour max in the gym. Monday : 10x10  calf extensions, 2x50 calf flexion, 10x10 squats or lunges,3x15 side bents,3x15 russian twists,3x15 side crunches,3x15 side knee raises,10x10 Bent over rows,5x20 power shrugs,5x20 cable tricep overhead extension,2x50  neck flexion.  Thursday: 3x5 calf extensions,3x5 weighted inverted rows,3x2 weighted pistol squats,5x5 Rack pulls,5x5 overhead tricep extension,3x10 handstand push ups,3x50 neck flexion.  Saturday: 10x10 pull ups,10x10 W raises or face pulls,5x10 behind the back deadlifts,10x10 woodchoppers,2x100 cable tricep kickback,2x50 neck flexion.  And at home i use bands to train my biting force, and also do some finger flexions and extensions.  no chest,so is it obligatory to train chest or i can ignore it with no worries? What can go wrong if i don't train my chest? "
973,How long before first marathon?,"For someone of a healthy weight and in good cardiovascular shape (swimming and cycling) how long should I wait before my first marathon? Until last month I never ran more than 5 miles in my life, but I now run 15k+ about once a week.  I would like to run a marathon in about 5 months. I've found a 16 week plan that seems reasonable to me. Would that be too soon since I have been only running for 1 month? Based on my run last weekend (16k) I am guessing I could complete a half marathon in under two hours today. "
974,Jumping rope aka Skipping,"I weigh 235 pounds I:e. 107 Kgs. I have started jumping rope for 30 minutes, few exercises for 10 ‘minutes and then 1 hour 6km walk I.e. approximately 4 mile walk per hour. Is this good workout??? I’m not interested in going to gym. I’m at the beginner’s level in jumping rope. So I’m hardly able to do 15 jumps continuously. I am feeling a lot of pain in legs but it isn’t unbearable. My knee is perfect. So just to be on safe side I wanted to know if I should keep following this workout? Although after workout it feels like there’s no legs sometimes. It pains but I am now moving with a motto No pain no gain. It is my humble request please do tell me the honest replies. Thank you! "
975,Feel bad after a Max O2 test - is it normal?,"At work I did a standard Max O2 test on a stationary bike. In the hours after I didnt feel so good.  Is this normal? If not, is it likely that I have a low tolerance for exercise?  Or is it just that I am not very used to it?   (Would it be the Biking or the intense exercise?.  Right now, I do not have a high fitness level, but my health is good.  In the past, I feel I always have had problems with exercise, even when I was in good shape. "
976,Do curved treadmills help with proper running form?,"Do curved treadmills help with proper running form*?  In looking for a treadmill, I came across curved treadmills like the Woodway Curve and TrueForm Runner. They claim to help with form, but do they really? I’d like to find out before dropping $5000+ (or would I be better off with another treadmill?)   I realize that “proper running form” can vary between individuals, but I believe we could all agree that, undeniably, there are general good rules of thumb to follow (ie. Maintaining a short, quick stride, keeping your knees in line, etc)  "
977,How do I make my muscles harder/firmer?,"I'm into bodyweight training and it's worked better for me than the gym. I follow the Convict Conditioning program and it's working well for me so far.  I'm noticing progress every time I work out so I think I'm on the right track... however, my muscles are quite soft, especially my pecs. I'm kind of happy with the firmness in my arms and legs, at least I'm noticing improvement in firmness and strength. Abs are soft but I'm noticing improvement in firmness.  My pecs are getting stronger but I find them extremely soft.  I'm naturally thin, i.e. I find it harder to gain weight than losing weight. I'm not too thin either so I'm quite happy with my weight. So I guess high body fat is probably not a reason for my soft pecs.  1) How can I get them firmer? 2) Are firmer muscles necessarily healthier? I read somewhere that firmer muscles mean that they're not relaxed.  I'm not comfortable with protein shakes or other products so I don't have them. "
978,French-press and load,"Let's say I'm doing french-press: [website]with two options. Once with wide grip, and elbows kept wide. Next time close grip, elbows - the same. Other parts of move - the same. I mean head touched at the same point, same about end of move. Question is about load I can take in short grip, or better to say it's drop. Why is that narrow grip gives big drop at load? I can expect that it makes long head playing main role, while wide grip activates side heads. Can anyone explain that in details?  "
979,Training for shoveling snow,"I'm a pretty active 45 year old weight lifter. Here in the mid atlantic our winters are annoying. And,  when it snows, I have a lot of the white stuff to move via snow blower and shovel. What I am finding is a lot of  upper arm discomfort after a day out in the cold  muck. I get a shooting pain from my shoulder to mid arm along the bone between the bicep and tricep.   I'm thinking that I need to modify my training so that I can accommodate the strain of snow removal better. But what exercises would be best? Sure,  I'm getting older and don't recover  like I used to... But that is just another  thing to deal with. Thoughts?  "
980,Does weighlifting have the same benefits as HIIT?,"Background of HIIT  High intensity interval training (HIIT) is generally performed by sprinting close to maximum capacity followed by rest. The process is repeated several times. Proponents of HIIT say that it burns more fat than steady state cardio, because the resting metabolic rate is increased after a session of HIIT, which leads to burning additional calories even after the HIIT session.   Question  The procedure of HIIT sounds quite similar to weightlifting. If you just replace sprinting with lifting weights, all the other steps are the same. Performing a weightlifting set to failure is also considered pushing oneself to maximum capacity. People also rest in between sets. This makes me wonder why articles on HIIT always suggest sprinting and never even mention that weightlifting as a form of HIIT. Well, is it? Can weightlifting also give you the same increased RMR as well as traditional sprinting HIIT? "
981,How can a obese person with a spine and leg injury lose weight?,"How can a person who is 160 KG and 180 CM tall change into a healthy person who weighs 75~80 KG? How can one plan for this? Jogging is not possible because he has a leg injury and spine problem at L3 L5. Is ""jogging/walking"" in swimming pool okay? Water can help support his body weight.  I do not see this question as duplicate because this person is very stubborn and has a lack of determination, normal methods of weight-loss will not likely work.  "
982,Exercise to improve sleep,"I understand that cardiovascular exercise raises the body temperature immediately, making it harder to sleep at the moment. But then, after 5 hours, your body temperature falls below what it was right before you started exercising, making it easier to sleep.   Therefore, when I want to sleep at 10 PM, it's good to finish 20-30 minutes of exercise by 5 PM.   But if 5 PM slips by and I haven't exercised, have I lost all chance of utilizing this mechanism? Or are there some changes I can make to the activity I would have done that will result in my body cooling itself off faster?  "
983,What is the (a) proper way to pool run?,"What is the right way to pool run? Some specific questions I have are:   Should you use a floatation device? What type? Should you just use a normal running motion? If not, what changes should you make? Should you be touching the bottom of the pool? Should you be moving forward, or staying stationary?   In case the answer depends on my goal, my goal is to use pool running as low impact HIIT training. "
984,How is muscle micro-damage different from physical muscle damage?,"It is often claimed that muscle damage is a cause for muscle strength and hypertrophy, but if this is the case,  then if i cause some micro-tears to a muscle using, say, some tiny needles, would that cause muscle hypertrophy? How is this type of muscle damage different from the one caused by training? "
985,Is the hookgrip dangerous?,"Are the chances of losing a thumb with hook grip really high? If not, can other problems occur, and which would be the most relevant? "
986,Strength training to prevent accidents,I am a 44 year old male. A few days ago I managed to fall skiing downhill and hurt some ligaments in my shoulder. I have done a lot of skiing in my life and must have fallen a 100 times without hurting myself seriously.   Falling and hurting oneself is something I associate with older people but for me this is coming sooner. The reason for this may be that I am tall: 192 cm and heavy: 100 kg.   I understand that flexibility is very important and will adress this. Also I will lower my bodyfat percentage.  What I am wondering is how my situation should influence my strength training?  I have read that the fast muscle fibers are the one we loose as we get older. That seems plausible since we use the enduring ones a bit in our daily life. I would think that on impact the muscles would mobilize and brace themselves to absorb the shock. The fast ones would maybe react faster than the enduring ones? Also max force would be important. Should I aim for max strength or explosive strength? I am a bit sceptical regarding training for explosive strength since I am afraid I might hurt myself.  Regarding bulk I would think that it would be best for me to add as little muscle mass as possible. I can probably loose 10 kg of fat but not much more.  And I do not want to be heavy since that leads to harder impact.   Unfortunately I have always had much more enduring muscle fibers than fast ones. So using say 10 reps instead of 5 have been the fastest way for me to get stronger. But now I can not afford to get bulky. I guess that means I should train with fewer reps? 
987,Workout plan for fitness-studio,"I recently started to visit a gym 2-3 times a week, because, as a programmer, I need some movement. Additionally, I have very low blood pressure which causes me nearly to faint sometimes when doing simple body-weight exercises.  I'm male, 19 y/o, 192cm, 85kg  Can you recommend a weight loss and condition gaining plan?  Currently; I'm about 90-120 mins in the studio:   20 min warmup on the bike (ca. 250 kcal) Row 2000m (ca 120 kcal) 3 x 25 crunches (25kg) 3 x 25 biceps curl (33kg) 3 x 25 triceps press (17kg) 3 x 25 shoulder press (25kg) 3 x 25 pull downs (29kg) some leg stuff (can't remember the names) 30 min on empty devices 10 min final on bike (ca 110 kcal)   Is there anything I could optimize?

988,BODY by SCIENCE - THE BIG 5 WORKOUT for home,Is there a way to practice the BIG 5 WORKOUT at home with minimal equipment? Is there a video or pictures I can use for it? Does practicing with the BODY SCIENCE method helps to improve the aerobic level?  
989,A2G Squats: Is Ankle Flexibility the Right Concern?,"I am trying to go all the way down on squats. It seems that if my heels are way up I can keep my back straight and prevent ""butt-wink"". So, the logical solution here seems to be the stretch my calfs.   Maybe I am being paranoid, but my ankles are already pretty flexible, so I am afraid this is the wrong approach, which leads to two questions.   Is there a standard for ankle flexibility? Is there a ""too far"" where it becomes a bad thing? What is the other major inflexibility point causing ""butt wink"". I keep reading things about ""hips"", but that's way too general.  "
990,Is HIT (High intensity training) is appropriate for improving cardio aerobic for competition?,"I'm at age of 43 and I practice martial arts. In sparring and competition I struggle with breathlessness. Is HIT the best way to improve my cardio and aerobic level?   Are there additional ways to improve it?

991,Developing very strong Quadriceps,I'm 43 old and I have practiced martial arts for the last few years. My thighs have strong muscles but I don't think they are strong enough. Some of the practitioners in my martial art have thighs that are strong as iron 'literally'.   Strong thighs are important since we absorb hits using them.   What is the best way to strength the thighs at home with minimal equipment and minimal time (I have dumbbells and Iron Gym Upper Body Workout)? Are there some drills relevant to Body by Science method (Big 5)?  
992,Which diet at begining of musculation on bulking period?,I started musculation and I did only 3 sessions for now. I want to gain muscles so basically I've started by having 4200 kcal per day and having 3 trainings per week.  I am more or less a skinny fat (thin arms/legs/back and fat hips). Should I follow diet and eat alot from now ? or should I train more in order to make my body ask for more enery and then eat more ? Now I do not feel lack of energy because I did only 3 days gym. 
993,Vitamins: How much is too much?,"I received some Kinetica Essential tablets with some protein (I paid a little more for them, they weren't free), and looking at the RDA for the vitamins it contains raises some questions. They recommend 4 tablets a day which amounts to some huge %'s.  For example:   Vitamin B8 (Biotin) is 4000% RDA Selenium content is 4000% RDA Vitamin B12 content is 8000% Vitamin B1 (Thiamine) is 9,091% RDA etc.   A side effect of all of this is that my urine is bright (almost nuclear) yellow, even when I'm completely hydrated.  My questions are: Are too many nutrients or vitamins bad for you? 9000% of anything doesn't sound great, so are these tablets more of a hindrance than a help? Are these amounts of vitamins safe or too much?  Thanks "
994,Do you need a variety of foods in your diet?,"Is a variety of foods necessary to your diet? When exercising to lose fat or build muscle, nutrition is like 80% of your results. I understand that you need a lot of protein to support muscle growth, and generally want healthy fats and low-moderate healthy carbs to lose fat. Now breaking that down a little bit further, is it necessary to get a your proteins from a wide variety of sources, or your fat from a wide variety of food?  I, personally, would rather just eat the same thing everyday without any variety, because it is easy to manage. Would it be OK if I simply ate the same thing everyday, or do I need to get my macros from a wide variety of foods?  For example, this diet:  Every day:  Breakfast: 100% whole grain bread with organic fruit spread and almond butter and string cheese.  Lunch and Dinner: Chicken breast, black beans, brown rice, 2 servings broccoli, cooked in olive oil. Other: Protein shake, a couple hard boiled eggs for snack, multivitamins, omega-3 fish oils.  Would it be sufficient to simply eat this diet every single day, or would a variety of different sources of proteins, carbs, and fats be necessary for losing weight/building muscle? Would this diet give me all the essential nutrition I need? "

996,How fast should my base runs be?,"I am trying to reach my goal of a 4:10 for the 1500m this track season. To anyone who has previously trained in mid-distance, roughly how fast should my base runs be? I can currently run 5 or 6 miles miles comfortably at a pace slightly under 7min/mile, should I be pushing myself harder on non-workout days? "
997,Benefits of Overhead KB Walks,"Can someone explain to me cumulative benefits of the following:  Friend and I went for a Saturday walk at a park. We each had a kettle bells and they weighed 35lbs and 55lbs respectively.  The track was 1 mile. The workout was as follows:  Kettle Bell A - 35lb Kettle Bell B - 55lb  Each person gets a Kettle Bell. Walking at the same time. We went   25 steps One hand overhead press holds  25 steps one hand rest on shoulder holds  Switch hands  25 steps One hand overhead press holds  25 steps one hand rest on shoulder holds   Switch From KB A to KB B and repeat.  We did this for 0.5 miles or roughly 10 times with each KB. I would consider this Lower intensity, as we weren't running. (Correct me if I'm wrong)  We stopped and did    200 swings 100 with A 100 with B each.   Walked 100 ft. with Both KBs overhead Switched Hands Walked 100 ft. with Both KBs overhead  So I think the above were stabilizing each shoulder because of the different weights..?  Then farmers walk the rest of the mile, minimal to no rest the entire time.  At the end I felt utterly destroyed, and I'm curious was this CNS work? Core is probably an obvious one, shoulders, what else was affected? Is this actual Low Intensity or High Intensity?  "
998,Energy intake and expenditure,"I was reading below and have a doubt.  [website]So to lose weight ""energy in"" should be less than expenditure . So they advice us to eat more low energy density foods (LEDF) to feel full , so hunger will be satisfied and also the in/out formula.   1) What is the relation of hunger and energy ? If we fool hunger by eating LEDF does this not stop having the energy need for body ? Isn't hunger is the natural signal for energy requirement ? "
999,Breathing through the mouth,"Is breathing through the mouth while jogging bad? I find it difficult to close my mouth while jogging. Some sources claim that breathing while exercising should only be done through the nose while some claim that breathing through the mouth will involve intake of a larger quantity of oxygen. This argument sounds correct.   But, breathing through the mouth does not filter out the dust inhaled. This sounds like a favourable argument for the first claim.   So which one is actually true?   My source for the first claim are regular joggers who I personally know. I'm new to jogging(never seriously considered it over my entire life until now).   source for second claim "
1000,Front squats lagging behind back squats by too much,"Background  I've noticed that my front squats are seriously lagging behind. I know that most people have a weaker front squat than back squat, but mine is about 50-60% behind in terms of 5-8RM.  I suspect that among all the muscle groups that are worked by both variations, there is a subset of muscles that are holding me back.  Question  Which muscle groups are more central to the front squat than the back squat? What accessory exercises would assist me in developing a stronger front squat?  How I do them  In terms of stance, I have a semi-wide stance, feet pointing only slightly outward. Akin to riding a horse.  I cross my arms over the bar, rather than the backward wrist bend. I find I have no problem keeping the bar on my shoulders as I raise my elbows in front so that they are always parallel to the ground.  I place the bar just inside the front delt, so the bar is very close to my neck, and since the front delt is flexed by raising the elbow, the bar has additional support which prevents it from going anywhere. "
1001,How to avoid muscle loss when doing prolonged cardio (around 15 days in a row)?,"I know this question may seem irrelevant since there are many good answers addressing it, for example this one. However, the questions and answers I found are all about losing muscle while regularly doing cardio exercise along the year or while following a diet.  My case is a bit different: I plan to walk the GR20 (France) in July, which is said to be one of the most physically difficult GR (French for ""Great Hiking"", if I do not translate badly). It will probably last around 15-16 days (10km a day, but it is very intensive, because of the height difference — it is in the mountain).  I exercise regularly: both bodyweight exercises and moderate cardio (running 30 minutes 3 times a week). I have no problem building muscle and eat accordingly. My goal is not to be muscular, but I do not want to lose (too much) muscle during this trip. How can I avoid that or, if it is not possible, reduce the impact?  Of course, sufficiently eating carbs and protein will be important, but should I expect an (important) loss of muscle, should I continue to exercise when I shall arrive at the shelter (since I do bodyweight exercise, it is possible)? "
1002,Is there another exercise opposite to the Stomach Vacuum?,"Does the  Stomach Vacuum have some opposite exercise to it, like expanding the stomach? Or is this useless?  "
1003,Does training > 75% MHR benefit aerobic base?,"I've been reading that developing one's aerobic base is good for improving overall speed, and that to do so, I should be training at 60-75% of MHR. Is there still merit for overall speed in training above 75% of MHR? Or should I be saving that for trying to set a new PB once a month of something?  Background: I'm getting back in to running, I've read that one of the tests used when joining the UK military is to run 1.5 miles in &lt;12:30, and then another 1.5 miles in &lt;10:00. I don't particularly want to join the military, but it seemed like a good target - 3 miles in under 22:30. I'd also quite like to beat my half-marathon PB. "
1004,Impact of cardio during caloric surplus (Bulking phase),"   In two weeks: 5 sessions of intense cardio (sprinting) of 15 minutes   each; 9 sessions of moderate to heavy lifting of 45 minutes to 1 hour   each.   This is my planned schedule, all of it during a caloric surplus. Also, note that the cardio sessions are planned for my off days from lifting. I've been working out for 3 months, in a bulking phase (no cardio), went from 123 lbs to 143 lbs (5'9 height). Noticing a bit of fat collecting on my belly area, the rest of the body looks fine. My questions are:        Would this plan be an optimal solution for increasing muscle mass while keeping fat gains to a minimum and reaping the other benefits of   cardio (I would not be eating at a deficit)?   Will this amount of cardio affect my muscle gains?   Should my pre and post workout meal remain same for the cardio sessions or what would be an ideal recommendation?   Is cardio, during a caloric surplus, worth it?      Also, my conditioning with respect to cardio is negligible. I do a desk job and don't have any other sports activity during the entire week.  My question is a direct reference to this youtuber I follow. "
1005,"Resistance bands: What do the resistance ranges of ""X to Y"" pounds mean?","If you look at the typical product description of a resistance band (Amazon is a good place to see a lot of these), you'll see that nearly all of them give a range of resistance.  For example, one band might say 25-80 lbs of resistance while another says 50-125 lbs.  What do these ranges mean and how do I achieve the resistance levels in between?  Does the amount of resistance depend on where you're stabilizing the band?  If it's 50-125 lbs of resistance, how do I know when it's 50, 75, or 125?  What do I have to do to get 50 lbs if I want to do curls?  How would I use the same band differently if I wanted 125 lbs for leg exercises? "
1006,Should an underweight person avoid strenuous exercise?,"Exercise is great, but should someone who is underweight (approximately 168cm and 49kg for a BMI of 17.4) focus on gaining weight (until a healthy weight is reached) before beginning strenuous exercise?  My friend has no history of anorexia or bulimia (that I am aware of) or any health problems. There are some famous female endurance athletes (runners, etc) who are similarly underweight, however she is an exercise novice without their level of cardiovascular fitness.   I am concerned (knowing her personality) that she will push herself too hard and and risk injury.  What are the health risks associated with too much exercise while underweight? "
1007,Running in the same speed or shifting gear?,"I am a beginner in running who run about 2 miles per day. How can I improve it? And also I want to know, is that better to run in the same speed or to shift gear during the running? "
1008,Bending knees in reverse hyperextension,"According to this website that the target muscles of this exercise is the Gluteus, and the hamstring muscles as secondary muscles. While doing this exercise I am obliged to bend my knees since the bench I have is not  the same height as  my legs, so the following is  a picture that explains the situation.     My question is: does bending the knees affect the impact of the exercise on the mentioned muscles?  Does this includes an effect on the lower back muscles?   Thank you in advance. "
1009,Is it harmful not to wear an underwear while running?,"Shall we or shall we not wear an underwear while exercising?  Though it may boil down to personal preference. But I am looking at it from health point of view. Some say that it's harmful not to wear an underwear while exercising or playing or running. But I am not able to find any concrete data/study regarding the same.  So, is there any consensus yet? "
1010,I have about 18.5% body fat. Am I too fat?,"I'm a man, 25 years old. My electronic scale tells me 69 kg and 18.5% body fat, and my fitness seems to be bad when compared to my friends at similar age:   I run very slow. Most of my friends run 5 km around 20 minutes but I need 23 minutes at race speed. When I run with my friends together, I always lag behind them whenever an upward slope / stairs are encountered. My friends seem to not lose speed when going up the slope, however, for me I think it is natural for the speed to be reduced as physical phenomenon. My ankles feel very stressed whenever I run, and get pain after long (starting from 8 km) runs, coming with swollen feet, exactly like this article describes ([website]Some of my friends start, stop and turn very fast in their run, i.e. have great acceleration. However, if I need to run long, I must start my run slowly with only little acceleration, otherwise I will get exhausted very soon. For comparison, a bus always start much slower than a motorcycle. In my 10 km race, I think I used nearly a km until I reached cruise speed. I cannot tolerate heat. Even though I can run 10 km at the above speed in winter, in summer (e.g. at 32℃ 80% humidity) I can't run anywhere near the above speed for ANY distance. If I attempt to run at the race speed, I will become overheat in less than 1 km and have to stop. In contrast, I always run with sleeveless and athletic short even under 10℃ and get sweating if I run hard enough when my friends are already wearing t-shirt. The same holds in swimming as well, the so-called ""swimming season"" in my region is April to October but I seldom swim in July to early September because the water temperature is SO DAMN HOT, like 29℃ sea temperature under the afternoon sun, where I cannot tolerate and must exit the water maybe only 100 to 200 m of swimming. The pool is worse than, the water temperature can reach 32℃ where heat stroke is a real concern. However, I LOVE swimming out-of-season when the water temperature goes below 24℃, and swim for an hour in the middle of winter where the water temperature is only 16℃. Fat is a good insulator of heat, does that mean I am too fat if I can swim comfortably in the middle of winter?   Does reducing fat solve my above problems?  P.S.: Before I got my full-time job, I was only 62 kg. I didn't have the body fat scale at that time but I think the amount should be about 13-15% based on my shape, at that time I actually ran faster (about 22'12"" for 5 km but now need 22'50""), did more push-ups (about 30 at that time but now having trouble even completing 20). However, after 1 year of full-time job, my weight increased to 73 kg because I didn't have ANY time to exercise, and left that job on contract maturity because it damaged my health too much. "
1011,How can ballet dancers deal with ingrown toenails?,I am suffering from ingrown toenails as a result of fairly recent and constant ballet dance routines. I got them cut back at a chiropodist but it still hurts. What should I do ? Keep cutting them back  - or get them removed ? 
1012,Carb cycling while maintaining strength on the bar,"I'm looking to lose some of the belly fat that I'd accumulated while doing Starting Strength (SS) for the last 6-7 months. At the same time, I don't want to lose the strength that I've on the bar. From what I see after googling, it seems like Carb Cycling (having a combination of High/low/No carb days over the entire week) seems to be the answer. However, like most things on the net, the specifics vary widely, and I'm unable to tell a reliable source from one thats not. Hence, I've the following queries that I hope the community can answer - or even better, point me to resources that've worked for you!   What is the typical duration of a carb cycle - I want to get back to making progress on my lifts, and I know that can't be done when I'm losing fat, and in general on a calorie deficit! What are the most reliable, detailed source of information for the nutrition aspect of Carb cycling? Some sites advocate a High/Mid/Low spread, while others insist on having at least some No Carb days! Also, the definition of ""High"" vs ""Mid"" is not entirely consistent! If my current lifts are as follows: Deadlift => X, Squat => Y, Bench Press => Z (in the same pattern as a SS routine), should I be following the exact same routine with same reps/set and max weight, or should I be expected to drop some sets (how many?) while keeping the work set at same weight and reps? Anything else I'm not focussing on (that I should take care of) while attempting such a routine!  "
1013,Optimal sequence of workouts during split routines,"Assuming Person A, Person B and Person C trains chest and back the same day.      Person A performs 9 sets of chest first then proceeds to 9 sets of   back.      Person B performs 9 sets of back first then proceeds to 9 sets of   chest.      Person C perform 3 sets of chest, then 3 sets of back then 3 sets of   chest and so on.   Further assuming that each of them weigh the same, have similar diet plans, train moderately heavy (8-12 Reps per set), have same goals of gaining equal amount of size on both the muscles and are training for building muscle mass;      Will Person A and Person B be training their second muscle less   efficiently due to increased fatigue?      Will Person C be unnecessarily increasing his rest times for a particular muscle?      Which one of them will working out close to optimality for the accomplishment of the above-stated goal?  "
1014,Do activity trackers count steps when you don't move your arms?,"I have a Jawbone up which I wear on my wrist. As far as I know it calculates my step count by measuring the movements of my arm when I walk/run. So if I have my hands inside the hoodie pockets(when it's cold outside) which I think don't involve in any movement when I walk, how does the fitness tracker count steps? Or does it not count at all?

1016,Effect of whey protein on blood cholesterol level,"I am new to body-building ( started 4 months ago; workout 4 times a week ).  Due to my lifestyle ( choices ), my diet only contains occasional white meat servings and very little red meat.  My intake of eggs is limited due to my high cholesterol levels  ( I have been taking low doses of Statins to help control this condition ).  Thinking that my body might need more protein for muscle growth, repair and workout recovery ( I feel very zonked and drained after every session ), I thought I'd use some Whey protein supplement as a means to supplement my regular diet to provide my body with extra protein.    However my trainer tells me that the use of Whey protein will adversely affect my cholesterol levels and that I should use amino acids instead.      Here then are my questions:  1.) Can the use of Whey Protein supplements adversely affect/increase blood cholesterol levels? Is this a known fact?  2.) Could the use of BCAA instead help with muscle tissue growth and repair  without affecting blood cholesterol levels adversely?  3.) For how long would one usually take BCAA's and would there be any serious adverse health effects in the longterm from taking them?  Since I usually commence workouts later in day after a full working day, I start gym sessions in an already fatigued state,   4.) Can the use of Creatine help with energy levels? Like helping you kick start your gym sessions with a little boost ( and thus overcoming the fatigue from a day's work )? "
1017,Is this PPL routine suitible for my Goals?,"Questions:   Is the following routine suitable for my goals? Is the routine balanced and efficient? (eg.

I get popping/grating shoulder when doing dumbbell presses so I don't do them!   My goals:  In order of preference:   Aesthetics: I'm doing this to look good. I am pairing my exercise with a 10-15% calorie deficit to reduce my BF% from mid twenties to high teens. Balance: I want to achieve what I deem to be a balanced body. My squats and deadlifts are good for that of my goal bodyweight but my upper body is lagging.  Improve my main lifts (Deadlift, Squat, Bench).   Routine:  I put this together from a range of different PPL routines. Its a 6 day rotation, either PPL[rest]PPL or PPLPPL[rest]. I lowered individual set volume on the big lifts to continue progression to higher weights. I do accessory AB work at home with planks and ab-wheels on a daily basis.

1018,Squats and strange looking knees,"I'm a small guy, but I can put up decent weight on squats.  My lower body is stronger than my upper body.  Since I started squats (a long time ago), my legs looks strange to some people.  Just diagonally upward (and inside) of my kneecaps are bulges (lower quadriceps, I guess) that look sort of like second kneecaps.  They're actually more prominent than my real kneecaps.  What I'd like to know is: is this normal?  Is it possible I've been doing squats with the wrong form this whole time (and quadriceps are taking more load than they're supposed to, for example)?  I don't worry about how my legs look - I just want to be sure I'm doing the exercise right. "

Is this common? Any help is appreciated =) "
1020,What is the correct dose and frequency of aerobic exercise for unconditioned middle age people?,"This is the general question:  How often and how long should do soft aerobic exercise a middle-aged man in his 40s, provided that he his healthy but out of shape? If possible, please focus your answer specifically on fast walking as exercise    Now, after the general question, I would like to add some particular details that may help the readers understand better what I want to know:  I am 41, quite out of shape but I have permission from the doctors to do aerobic exercise. Because several months ago I returned to weight training improperly after 18 years of sedentary computer work, and then aggravated it by improperly stretching my pecs and carrying my 16 kg doughter always on the same arm, I am still recovering from several tendonitis in both shoulders.  In the meantime, I am doing some aerobic exercise every day. But, after having injured myself so badly, this time I want to be sure that I am doing the aerobic exercise properly and that I am not going to die suddenly in the middle of the street because I was stressing my heart too much, or who knows what may happen this time...  This is exactly what I have been doing in the last 11 days:  I start walking very fast, just at a pace where it seems that I should instead start running. But I don't run, I just stay walking. I do this uninterruptedly for up to 45 min. I wear a fairly good running shoes. I check my pulse at least twice during the walk, and it always stays between 120 and 150 bpm (I never let it go over 14 beats in six seconds). I breath correctly. I don't feel it is exhausting, but rather slightly challenging. I think I could say some sentences aloud while walking, as long as they were short and there were enough pauses to breathe in between. I sweat a bit but not too much. At the end, I stretch my quads a bit.  I have written down how long I do this every day. This are the times up to yesterday: 25, 30, 36, 45, 45, 41, 45, 45, 43, 42 and 45 min.  Is that wrong? Should I insert rest days or something?  If this question seems too localized because of the additional details I gave, please feel free to answer only to the general question at the beginning, and I will try to derive the appropriate adaptation to my personal circumstances. Nevertheless, I think that explaining the correct way of starting a soft aerobic walking program for middle-aged unconditioned people is something of a general interest, and the personal details I added are valuable as an example of how it should (or how it should not) be done.

1021,Why do we get fat only to a certain point?,"I was just thinking and wondering about it.   Earlier in my life i ate a lot of snacks and drank soda. Ate way more and way more unhealthy and didn't do any sports but never got heavier than 78kg. Now i live way healthier. I eat healthy, eat less, do sports and have about 70kg. But if i was to quit sports and get back into my old eating habits I would put up 3-4kg in a month i'm sure of it.   But why wouldn't I get fatter after a certain point(78kg for me)?   If I take more kcal in than I put out, shouldn't I theretically gain those 3-4 pounds every month as long as i continue to live like that and soon reach the hundrets?  "
1022,Is there a connection between general fitness/workout gain and body hair?,"It might be a silly question but something that have been bugging me for many years now. Pretty much all male athletes (regardless of their discipline) look pretty much like newborn babies with the exception of their facial hair. Likewise I've had friends in high school who'd get rid of their body hair, claiming that it'd help them be better athletes i.e. be stronger, jump higher or something like that.   Is it an urban myth or is there some physiological background to it? The little I know, is that hair follicles usually hold fat in them, thus it might have some effect on keeping fat in the body, but surely it can't be much?  Any perspective on the matter? Please do support your opinions with some sort of reference. "
1023,Different ways to calculate heartrate zones,My heartrate is 65 at rest and top heartrate i can get while biking is 191. My goal is to burn some extra fat so i try to get i the 60%/70% zone for optimal fat burning.  Now i find there are 2 ways to calculate this zone.   Take 60% and 70% of your max rate: 114-134 (60% or 70%) * (max Hr - rest Hr) + rest Hr) 140-153   These result turn out very different but which one is correct? Or how should i interpret these?

1026,how to keep the chest tendon injury free while training heavy bench press?,"Here and here you can see me bench press 200 Kg.  I don't bench 200Kg 440 Lbs all year long. After reaching the 200, it goes down gradually back to 160 and then 160 for 2 reps and slowly up.  I use several paths in achieving that but the most common is 10 sets of 1-2 reps.  My question here today is related to an injure that happens sometimes. I am currently doing 2 reps on 180 Kg.  I did this on sunday, but after benching I went doing some chest flies which I normally do.  I hurt my chest tendon, so today wednesday I am still feeling it.    this picture came from this website below:  Rupture Of The Pectoralis Major  Im have been putting ice in the morning over it, and I have not trained since sunday but today is wednesday and I want to go again.  I will do it light with extra amount of warming up and stretching, and keep monitoring it.  This question is not so straight forward but what I would like to know is:  I know that this was caused by the 180Kg x 2 plus the flies how can I progress and what is there that I should do and\or take to keep my chest tendons healthy and carry on progressing towards the 200Kg?  I am natural but would consider any supplement for a cycle if that is what it would take.  I prefer remaining natural though, so that is my first choice. "

Because I feel the pain less now, does that also mean I can work out the same muscle earlier than before?  And if not, what kind of recovery period should I be giving the muscles? "
1031,How Can I Stop Swinging On Pull-Ups?,"Whenever I do pull-ups, Palms facing in, my body swings forward and backward. I'm trying to avoid this because I was told that swinging will make pull-ups ""easier"", and take stress off of the target muscles. Is staying straight something that I will have to train myself to do? Am I doing them wrong? "
1032,Whey protein for weight gain?,"I intend to gain weight and I want a muscular physique, and I'm going to work out. Will whey protein help me in weight and muscle gain? And which one should I take, Isolate or Concentrate? My weight is 63 kilograms (approx 138 pounds) and height is 5'9.5"" "
1033,What's lean muscle mass?,It is said that men usually have more lean than women. I would like to know what does the 'lean muscle mass' mean? is it just the muscle mass? How would you calculate it? 
1034,Lost weight wrong,"I've kind of been at a plateau for a while now. I'm currently 159 Lbs I am about 5'9. I started off the November of last year at 195 Lbs. I didn't know much about health or exercise or anything I had not done adequate research. My approach to the weight loss was do lots of cardio and I actually went on a vegetarian diet for maybe 3 months, which consisted of mostly carbs and processed vegetarian foods.   After all the weight loss my stomach is still huge and there is fat well all over my body. I know that through the journey I lost muscle and fat. Now I'm wondering what to do? I am hitting the gym now and lifting weights. Do I just keep a caloric deficit with the adequate Macros or should I not worry about calories build muscle then go on a cut? "
1035,"Not sure where to start? Underweight, bad cardio and diet","I'm 23 years old, I've always had a slim build, as a child I spent the majority of my time playing/doing active sports &amp; activities (Football, Marathon, Swimming, Boxing), my other interest has always been programming.  Once I finished school at 16 and got a job in software development, I drifted away from all sports and fell in to the habit of staying inside, for the past 6-7 years my ""active"" schedule has simply been, wake up go to work (sit at a desk for 8 hours), come home, play games or continue developing my own projects, then sleep (I end up staying up until 3-4am most nights and waking up for work at 8am).  Doing this over time, as expected, my health has deteriorated. I get really badly out of breath just running for 2 minutes, I haven't actually lost much weight, but that might be because I'm almost at the lowest weight I can be...  For as long as I can remember, even as a child, being brought up fairly poor, my diet has been awful, I could probably say for the last 10 years my diet has been something like this (on a good day):  Breakfast:   Some kind of cereal bar (usually im too tired to make anything)  A Coffee   Dinner/Lunch: would generally get skipped, even while in school, maybe a chocolate bar and a sugary (can) drink at the most.  Tea:   Some kind of variated ready meal (Microwave chicken dinner, microwave chicken pasta ect...)   Supper:    Toast   Has to be one of the worst diets ever, right? Obviously that's not fixed, it would change a little every day, but that really is on a good day, some days I just go all day on breakfast.  Around 3 years ago, I did have a spell of going to the gym to try gain weight/muscle, but my motivation quickly ran out, I don't find the gym fun at all, although I know it's not all about fun, so if properly advised I wouldn't complain about starting again.  So to my question... where do I start and what diet do I take up?  I'm unsure because I see my options as:   Go to the gym, lift heavy and eat ""heavy"" - but will this improve my cardio/health overall? Eating like a pig will just damage my health, will it not? Lifting heavy weights will just put strain on my heart with a (probably needed) fatty, high protein, high calorie diet, is that a good combination? - I tried this before as I said above, but I struggled to eat enough, and made very little progress. Do cardio and eat loads? I enjoy running and football a lot, but doing this would mean having to eat way more because I'm burning more calories, that sounds easy but for me it really won't be, and if I struggle with this, it will result in losing weight, and that really isn't healthy for me.   Either way I want to improve my health in the long term, and I think I need to start doing it now, but I don't know where to begin, because all I see is ""how to lose weight"", or topics on gaining weight but thinking that just because you're slim it means you have good stamina/cardio.  My Height: 5'11""/180cm  My Weight: 126lbs/57kg  Gender: Male "
1036,Lost weight and getting fit - where to go from here?,"I've maintained a pretty poor diet for most of my adult life, and as a software developer, I've spent most of my time behind a desk with very little exercise.  Since New Year 2011 I've lost nearly 2st (12s12 to 11s1) by eating sensibly and running 3 times a week.  I started following the Couch25K plan and I'm now working towards running 10K.  I've surprised the hell out of myself with what I've achieved and I want to continue my fitness run, but I don't really know where to head next.  I'd like to lose the remaining fat that I have around my belly, though I also have to be realistic about what I can achieve. My diet will never be perfect, I don't eat much fruit or veg, and now that I've hit my goal weight I like to treat myself to the odd bit of junk food and beers on a weekend - is it possible to lose the last bit of fat without having a perfect diet?  I've also read that it takes a long time to lose this last bit of weight, but have no idea whether than means months or years.  I'd also like to start gaining some muscle.  I'm not adverse to the idea of joining a gym, but feel like I'll just be using a load of random machines without actually knowing what I'm doing or if I'm doing the right thing.  What's the best way to get started with gaining muscle?  Thanks, Anthony "
1037,What is an optimal amount for protein intake?,"What exactly is a safe limit for taking whey protein? Different websites recommend different amounts of protein intake. The most common one that I see is around 0.8g of protein for every kilograms of weight.  I went to an online calculator for protein requirement and given my body specifications, the calculator recommends that I take 48grams of protein per day. I think my daily usual food can reach 48g of protein easily. In fact, I don't need whey protein to reach 48g of protein, if the calculator is right.  On the other hand, some websites recommend up to over 100g of protein, which is more than twice the recommended protein intake from the calculator!  I weigh about 100 pounds and stand at 5'4. I am a male and have a relatively small and thin body frame. Apart from my recent venture into the gym on some of the days to spend an hour lifting weights, my activity level is pretty sedentary.   I ask because I'm worry that I may either consume too much protein, which may overwork my  liver and kidneys, or consume too little protein, which is not most effective for my training in building up muscle size.   At this point, I am taking two scoops of whey protein on days after lifting weights. On other days that I don't lift weights, I take one scoop of whey protein.   So, again, what is a safe gauge for the amount of protein intake so that my body remains healthy and does not need to work extra to flush out the unnecessary proteins? "
1038,How many calories are burnt while typing on the keyboard?,"I apologize if this is not the correct place for this question. If it isn't,  feel free to move it!    There have been several studies on the amount of calories burnt by clicking a mouse. For instance, Convert Anything to Calories (PHP Science World) has made the following calculation:  “On average, 16.7 micromoles of ATP (Adenosine triphosphate) are consumed in moving one gram of muscle for one second. So, the total amount of ATP burned to move 11.7 grams of muscle in the index finger is approximately 195 micromoles (11.7g×16.7μ mol/g). There are 7.3 calories in one mole of ATP energy, so the number of calories burned in clicking the mouse equals about 1.42 {(7.3/1000) X 195)}.”  Note that calories here does not refer to the commonly named ""calories"", which in fact are kilocalories.  Are there any similar studies on the amount of calories burnt while typing? Or perhaps more specifically in the form calories/keypress? "
1039,Reasonable precautions for lake bacteria,"I've read quite a lot online about bacteria you can be infected with by swimming in freshwater lakes. Anecdotally I've had friends tell me that when swimming in a lake you should keep your head over water.   In many cases, avoiding submersion isn't an option, and you're going to freestyle swim anyway. Is it common for people to use earplugs or noseplugs or anything like that? If industrial pollution isn't a particular concern where you're swimming, would you take any precautions? "
1040,What kind of goals should I have if I want to be as healthy as possible?,I.e. If I want to live longer and avoid diseases. Should I target to build muscles or to be resistant as a marathoner? Is more exercise always better? (Besides risk of injuries of course) 
1041,Neck band rotation,"For a while I've been doing neck extensions,side bends,neck flexions,neck tucks and neck grip holds with bands and plates  Are neck rotations with resistance band good too ? I've seen football and rugby players do them.  Should I make them an option to do instead of some other of the exercise listed or add them to the routine as a core neck exercise?  "
1042,Developing slow transition in muscle-up,"I am working on developing the muscle-up: [website]I can perform a muscle-up at speed, but I am working at making the transition from pull-up to dip as slow as possible without relying on momentum generated in the earlier stages of the pull.  By performing an assisted pull-up with 'straight arms' (an open elbow) I can simulate the the motion of slowly transitioning to the dip phase of the motion. I can rise in a straight arm pull-up slowly to a point where my elbows are level with my hands with around -26kg of assistance, at a bodyweight of 72kg. My standard pull-ups are reasonable strong but do not take me as high as I imagine necessary for a slow muscle-up.  What is the most effective way to develop the necessary strength at the top of the pull?  I feel that the benefits from performing standard pull-ups are plateauing in terms of developing strength at this range of motion.  Should I:   Work muscle-ups at speed without assistance, using the momentum to transition? Work straight arm pull-ups with assistance (and if so what progression should I aim for, e.g. static holds, reduced assistance)? Build strength through some other movements (e.g. pull-down)?   I'm not entirely sure what muscle groups are involved during the slow transition. It feels like my biceps and triceps are engaged antagonistically to hold the arm straight, and that some muscles under my arm pit and sides of my thorax are tensed when performing the movement.  I suspect a variety of exercises in conjunction will be useful to improve this. "
1043,Creatine and water retention. Why to drink more water?,They say creatine causes water retention. At the same time they say you have to drink more water if you take creatine in order to avoid dehydration and kidney problems. Doesn't it sound illogical? If your body stores more water why do you need to drink even more? 
1044,Does the optimal hypertrophy rep range apply to tired muscles?,"It is generally accepted that the optimal rep range for muscular hypertrophy is around 6-10 reps. And it is also generally accepted that after 3 minutes of rest muscles will recuperate all the energy they can possibly get.  (Arnold Schwarzenegger, Joe Weider)  Do muscles still achieve optimal hypertrophy when they're tired and they hit that range? Let me give an example. I do 8 reps of 135 lb to failure on the bench press. I take a brief rest, about 30 seconds. To accomodate my current energy level, I must lower the weight to 95 lb to reach failure at 8 reps. Is this second set still achieving maximum hypertrophy? Or must I rest long enough to use 135 lb x 8 reps again?  Schwarzenegger, in his Encyclopedia of Modern Bodybuilding, has instructed never to rest long enough to completely recuperate. His reason was to not let the muscle get cold and to feel a better ""pump"". However, Weider refutes Schwarzenegger's advocacy of the ""pump"". In one of Weider's videos (4:29), Ms. Olympia 1982 Rachel McLish says:     You can go for the burn all you want and you will not get results.   So Weider suggests longer rest periods for more mass. Who is right? "
1045,Building big muscles leads to not enough testosterone?,"So far I've been trying to build bigger and bigger muscles because I thought that it will lead to having more testosterone in excess, therefore have all the benefits that a man can have with high levels of testosterone.   Yet, in this video John Gray gives an example which totally makes sense to me but I am not so into this, so I'd like to ask here. He says that the bigger the muscles the more testosterone gets used up for building more muscle or simply maintaining it, which must be true. He also ""asks"" ""Why then do they(huge muscles guys) take all these libido boosting herbs"" which kind of makes sense, since they have used up all the testosterone for building or maintaining these big muscles.    So again, does building big muscles lead to having not enough testosterone? If yes, then what would be an optimum, I guess having very little muscles isn't a solution either.. "
1046,Get calories from nutritional information,I'm eating a pack of biscuits and on the label the following information is given:     Nutritional information per 100g of product      Carbohydrates  -     75g   Proteins            -      6g   Fat -  15g   Cholesterol  -   0mg   Energy  -     468kcal   Calcium             -     60mg   Iron                -      8mg   I would like to know more about this information. What does the information in grams mean? Should I be only concerned about the calories? How can I get the calorie information? 
1047,How to lose weight and be able to do mental work?,"My problem is that when I start losing weight I feel so exausted that:   I'm angry I'm dumb and cannot do any mental work I always want to cheat my diet in the end of the day   All those ads say that I should be energized as a rocket and be happy with my results. But how can this happen if losing weight is not my body natural state?  UPD       I am exercising 3 days cardio (3.75     miles running) + 3 days of weight     training with personal trainer (1     hr). This is an ideal week - I     usually miss 1 day of cardio.          Yes, I'm dieting. I think my error is that I do not count         calories. Still on my TODO list. I         do eat self prepared food however I lost 15 pounds during 2 months and now it stopped going down with no obvious changes to lifestyle. I work as a software project manager, so yes - it's a desk job.         And I do not feel pretty good during         the day when I do not eat enough.   So yes - my question can be rephrased the way Tony says - ""Should losing weight make me feel exhausted?""   Sorry for my English just in case :). "
1048,Plan for 120 km bicycle race,"I have a 120 km bicycle race coming up this weekend, which is just outside of my comfort zone and I need a plan.  When cycling with a team, I can keep 30 km/h for about 2:20 or so and do my fair share of leading and taking the wind before I start to hit the wall, so the average 70 km tours are fine and I can manage 80 km myself in just under three hours but after about 2:20-2:30, it's no longer possible to raise my heart rate to catch up in any uphill anymore.  I tried 100 km myself once but the last 20 km took over one hour.  Looking at my results, I can squeeze in:   151 bpm for 2:14, or 337 bpm-hours of work 138 bpm for 2:56, or 407 bpm-hours of work   My problem is to squeeze in 120 km under that area somehow.  Being overweight, any uphill is a struggle when riding in a group.  Should I:   a) Conserve energy by riding in a group at all costs from the start, with the downside of peak pulse many many times from start to finish? b) Take it easy at the start and loose the group in up-hill and hope for a new, slightly slower team to ride with, with the downside of having to ride myself for long distances?  "
1049,Fast-twitch hand muscle exercises?,"A friend who spent some time in the military told me about a silent language in which the hands are signed in short, rapid bursts. Really, really rapid bursts, actually.  I've seen videos of both wing chun and speed stacking, but these seem to be about the arms, more or less exclusively. I have yet to find anything on fast hands on the internet, and I've been searching for a while. I've seen some people speaking relatively quick sign language on a city bus, so I'm inclined to believe my military friend.  Are there exercises to improve manual dexterity? Anywhere from the wrist to the digits -- how can I get more use from the fast-twitch muscles in my hands?  Bonus points if you can tell me what that military language is, or if he was pulling my leg :P "
1050,What type of pants are good for weight lifting?,"I'm more comfortable weight lifting in pants than in shorts, but find they inhibit proper knee position when squatting.     Are there any types of pants or material that will stretch well enough to be okay for squatting? Which features should good pants for weight lifting provide? "
1051,How to avoid overworking lower back?,"How can I avoid overworking lower back?   Everything I do hits lower back in some way... squats, deadlifts, rows.  How can everyone do all these exercises that work the lower back, every one of them without getting injured? "
1052,Is Hypercapnia (high CO2 in the blood) Normal In Distance Runners?,"I have been running 20 miles a week (three hour long runs, monday, thursday, and saturday) for a long long time. Last year in my annual physical I had a venous blood carbon dioxide level of 29. This year it is 33 (upper limit of normal is 31).  Is my blood carbon dioxide level high because my system has 'learned' to tolerate high levels of carbon dioxide? Am I going to drop dead in a week or two? Does anyone know? "
1053,Eating more calories to improve performance?,"I have been struggling to make progress in my swimming for quite a while now. Is it simply a need to eat more food to improve? I recently took 2months off swimming to assist my recovery. I want to achieve my goals in swimming, but I don't know if it is that simple to just eat more, becasue I feel like I'm already eating too much? "
1054,Can I skip chest day completely?,"I am a 18 yo male and I started going to the gym. I have only 3 days/week for working out. I am a combination of skinny, fat and muscle:)) I stand at 1,76 meters and I weight 68 kg. I decided to do: -1st day: back; -2nd day: legs and abs; -3rd day: shoulders, traps and forearm; Do you think it's enough for building some muscle? Or should I add chest day? Or maybe can I include only pushups at home as chest day?   EDIT: I have scoliosis, and kyphosis and my doctor recommended me to do either swimming or light weight exercises at gym. So, I want to strenghten my back and also to achieve a nice muscular body but not with heavy weights... "
1055,Overtraining my legs doing both cardio and leg workouts,"I work out three times a week, using a full body workout plan, doing one leg exercise each time (squats, lunges, deadlifts, with the largest weight I can lift, so it's quite challenging).  Two-three times a week I also do cardio in the form of HIIT to maintain/decrease my body fat, either running or using a stationary bike.  It's short (around 20 minutes), but rather intense (8-12 intervals).  The question is, can these sessions cause overtraining with respect to my legs?  Basically I use my legs quite intensively 5-6 days a week, so might the cardio days prevent them to get enough rest between two workout days? "
1056,Where is the longest steep run to use for training in the eastern United States?,"Steep being 12% grade or more, where is the longest steep run in the eastern United States?  Or more broadly, where is the best place to train in the eastern US for races like the Hardrock 100 or Pikes Peak Marathon?   In these races there are long stretches of +12% grade for 3, 4, 5 or more miles at a time. "
1057,Training plan for a sailor at sea,"My friend is a sailor and has a bit of a problem with designing a training plan for himself.  While at home, he does various activities, he likes swimming and rock climbing, sometimes he plays squash. He wants a trainign plan to keep him fit when he's at sea for 3-6 months.  There are problems with that. He has to travel light, so he cant take much equipment with him. Think something that would fit in a handbag or a small rucksack. He cant be running around the deck to make any reasonable running sessions, and he cant really do the usual bodyweight exercises. At the ocean the waves are so strong most of the time, that its either very hard or very easy to do a pullup for example, as the ship is going down or up and aiding/hindering the efforts.  What would be a good general-fitness training plan for such an environment? Maybe some resistance bands or springs...? Would that provide enough resistance? "
1058,Is running in smog a risk factor for developing asthma?,In some parts of the world smog is common year round. Should running outside be avoided in these areas? I prefer to run outside and have no health problems but am concerned about exposing my child to these same risks?  If running in smog can make it more likely to develop asthma how should an aspiring long distance runner train? Are treadmills alone sufficient? 
1059,Is this an adequate diet/exercise plan for weight loss?,"I'm a 25 year old male currently weighing 235 lbs (~106 kg) and I am 5'9 (~175 cm). For the majority of my life has been sedentary, I have never consistently exercised for any significant period of time.  I have been cycling for around 1-2 hours a day 4-5 times a week in the evening consistently at 13 m/h (20 km/h) with medium resistance.  I have been taking in 700-900 calories daily. I take multivitamins in the morning, eat one 110 calorie Jack Link's jerky snack pack for lunch and one 400 calorie Soylent drink for dinner. Throughout the day I drink 1-2 Diet Cokes. The rest of the calories are made up with an occasional snack in the morning which is usually a banana or doughnut.  So far I've lost 15 lbs (~7 kg) (down from 250 lbs) over the past two months down from, but I'm afraid that my diet might not be sustainable.  Is this an adequate plan purely for healthy weight loss? If not, what changes should be made? "
1060,Testosterone levels. Fighters vs Bodybuilders,"Who have the higher average testosterone levels? I know that bodybuilding boosts testosterone due to its exercises but what about fighters? All this danger they face.. not necessarily being afraid but there is certain amount of danger in fighting which stimulates the production of T. For example I've noticed before when preparing for a fight or when I am in any danger in general I can lift close to 2 times more weight and can endure much more, let's say doing push-ups for this example. This is clear sign of testosterone being produced from my body. There are many other examples that I can write about before fight preparation but you get the idea.  On the other hand preparing for fighting can be very exhausting which lowers T levels at the time.  So who are the guys with higher average levels of T? "
1061,Preparation for the muscleup,"What is the ideal exercise foundation that will prepare me to for muscleups? Some ideas I am considering are:   Losing weight until my BMI is well under 25 Weighted dips Weighted pull ups Negatives Overhead press Jumping pull ups Dead hangs   Anything I am missing? Which is most important? My BMI is about 26 right now and I can complete about 12 consecutive pull ups at the moment. Which grip(s) should I be using?  I a not a cross fitter so my goal is not a ""kipping muscleup"". I can do that already with no training. "
1062,Calf muscle recovery time when adapting to forefoot/barefoot running?,"I've been adjusting to forefoot/barefoot running for a couple months now. I keep extending my distance or increasing my speed or improving my form. Consequently, my calves have been staying sore for most of the last couple months. A week ago I decided to take a break and let my calves get completely recovered.   During this week of rest I did light activity. For example, yesterday I went for a 4 mile walk and during the walk I practised a few running drills (what Ryan Hall calls ""dribbles"") and I ran a few blocks focusing on technique a few different times during my walk.   But light activity can helped recovery, so I think I've done a pretty good job of backing off my training intensity for a week. I have also done some icing, compression and had two calf massages this week, etc.  Even after all that, my calves (soleus) are still slightly sore today, one more than the other. I can only notice this soreness if I flex them a certain way, so it is very slight soreness.  My question is this: should I take another day (or two) off and let the soreness go away 100%? Or can I go ahead and resume training before the soreness is completely gone?  What are the pros and cons of either approach?  I think this is a generic question that could apply to resuming training of many different types. My past experience is that people generally recommend training again even if there is a small amount of soreness from a prior workout in a case where the rest period for the muscle has been appropriate and most of the soreness is gone. This may be the general answer to my question: Is it healthy to exercise a muscle when it&#39;s still sore?  I'm excited to get out and run. I feel ready to go. That psychological state means something too.  What does Physical Fitness Stack Exchange think about this topic in the context of transitioning to a new running technique? Does the generic answer apply?  BTW, this running has done more for the appearance of my calf muscles than weight lifting ever did. I could never get my calves to grow before. Now I don't even care about that, but they do look better than I recall them ever looking in the past, no matter how much I worked them. "
1063,Which Custom Workout is Selected on miCoach Pacer?,"I set all of my current running program up in my miCoach Pacer. I had just been running in free mode prior to today, the only workout I had done that wasn't in free mode was my initial assessment workout. When I hit the workout selection button it just says custom workout and how long the custom workout is. How do I know which one is selected?   I pushed the button a couple times to see if it would give me any other information. It turns out that all my custom workouts for the next ~2 weeks are 1 hour 10 minutes, and so I ended up selecting one that was over a week ahead of where I should have been, which was a much more difficult workout, and I only finished a little less than half of it because of the intensity.  Is there a better way to identify them in the web interface so I can tell which is which, or is there a way to get the Pacer to identify them better? "
1064,tingling feeling in arm muscles while working out,"When I'm working out with a new weight that i'm not used to (I actually do calisthenics, but I use a weight vest) towards the end of my work out, when I'm really feeling it, I notice that as I'm doing exercises like push-ups, I sometimes get a tingling feeling in my arms. As soon as it starts, it continues on every rep until I stop.   It's not painful, it feels like tiny strings snapping almost. (I'm not very familiar with anatomy).   Intuitively, since it's not painful I would assume it is good because the whole point is to break down muscle right? This literally feels like I'm breaking down my muscle, but I'm too naive to understand if this is actually what's happening or if there's some other cause.   Does anyone else get this feeling? Is it normal?  Edit: Sometimes I notice afterwards some slight pain in my arms, but I don't know if it is related. I usually stop around this point and I feel fine after a bit of rest "
1065,Maintenance of the Flexor Hallucis Longus muscle for Long-distance Running?,"  The Flexor Hallucis Longus muscle can be in an intense training during long-distance running, particularly if forefoot running.      How do you maintain the Flexor Hallucis Longus muscle for long-distance running?   Helper questions        What kind of stretching and does it vary between different runs?   How should you diagnose pain in Flexor Hallucis Longus?   What kind of warming up before long distance running and after long distance running? Special tool such as bands?     "
1066,Starting to lift weights - True commitment or start as I can?,"I want to start lifting weights but I haven't because I've heard that, when you do start, you need to make a very true commitment. So I need to wait a couple of months for a few things to settle before I can make such commitment of time. I suspect then after the first two months of effort it will become part of my routine.  However, I could lift every once in a while right now, just not every M W F. Any thoughts on this? Should I start doing what I can or wait until I can really commit? "
1067,Can hyperglycemia make one thin?,"I'm interested if hyperglycemia can be associated with a person being thin. If the pancreas produce less insulin then need it, is possible that the reason for a person not getting fat even if it's eating a lot to be hyperglycemia?  If this presumption is false, do you know any other nutrition study based on why some people can't gain weight ? "
1068,How can I safely increase gluteal load in the bulgarian squat?,"In this video it is stated that lengthening the foot stance increases gluteal load. However, this also forces a flatter back angle, when a lot of people say that it's important to keep your back upright when doing bulgarian squats.  Is increasing stance length and leaning a bit more forward a good way to increase gluteal load without introducing weights, or are there better ways to do this? Or should I just look for a different exercise to train glutes? "
1069,Safe blood pressure for exercise,"I'm 27. Normally work as a programmer. I've been tracking my blood pressure and heart rate and at rest, they're quite high (around 120/80 and 90+ bpm).  I decided to go for a run today, combined with some squats and push-ups. My heart rate was still safe for my age (around 140 bpm), but my blood pressure shot up to 166/93. I normally get dizzy after a workout, but I realize now that it's due to blood pressure, not heart rate.  So, the question is.. how should I deal with this? Should I be aiming for less intense exercises? Should I be exercising more or less? Is exercise a good way of lowering blood pressure or is that something solely solved by better nutrition (and cutting down on the lamb)? "
1070,Why are push-ups and sit-ups so common?,"Growing up in many school activities we were made to do sit-ups and push-ups. In Navy Cadets we did pushups and situps whenever we exercised. I have also seen it included in many general fitness programs, including in a poster that appeared in our offices in the past couple of days.  Why are push-ups and sit-ups so common?   Is there any indication that these either:   Easy for the general population to perform without significant risk of injury? Have a greater reward for effort compared to other exercise? Exercise a greater part of the body or areas of the body that need more attention?  "
1071,Heart rate monitoring & tracking with the Samsung Galaxy Gear (or similar) Smartwatch. Possible?,"First, the faq states ""gear and gadgets used during exercise"" is on-topic. So I am going to ask about the Samsung Galaxy Gear Smartwatch (or similar watches) and I hope that is OK.  I would be interested in using a smartwatch as a full featured replacement for carrying my smartphone while running. I don't care about any phone-related functions. I don't even need to listen to music. I only care about tracking my workout in great detail. I want to record my route via GPS, my speed, my heart rate and even my cadence.  I use a Zephyr HxM that provides cadence, heart rate, and other data. (I also have a Zephyr BioHarness.)  Does anyone know if the capabilities of these new smartwatches that would make it possible to achieve my goals? If so, are there existing running apps that support this scenario?  Finally, since the Zephyr HxM provides r-r interval data, does any smartwatch app record this data?  Thanks "
1072,Naturally increasing my Metabolism,"I see all kinds of commercials on the TV about how to lose X amount of weight in Y amount of time, and how this old guy looks surprisingly like this younger guy, even though he's not supposed to. My main gripe about these commercials were that they are basically a tailored diet and exercise plan that anyone with Google (and some time) could figure out for themselves.  While visiting my father recently, I brought this up and he mentioned that at least one of these ""miracle plans"", used a pill to increase metabolism (which helps a lot with dropping fat during exercise).  My question is this: What natural ways can I use to increase my metabolism, and how effective are they?  I've heard numerous things towards this such as    Eating spicy foods Eating regularly Exercising Regularly Having a good-sized breakfast and eating proportionate meals Drinking plenty of water (which I picked up from this question)   Are there any others that I am missing? What has worked for you? What hasn't? "
1073,What is a DEXA reading?,"What is a DEXA reading?    In another question, ""What doctor/specialist can assess fat and body composition?"", an answer suggested getting a DEXA reading.  My brief research shows that it checks bone density, but I don't understand how that gives body fat percentage or lean mass.  P.S.  While we're all here, include what DEXA stands for. "
1074,What heart rate can a beginner runner expect?,"I've started running a couple of months ago. I'm 27, average height and normal weight. However it seems that no matter how slowly I run, my heart rate quickly climbs into the Max Effort zone of 170-180.  My GP checked me out before I started, and I recently had an ECG taken - everything was fine.  After I learned to run just a tad faster than walking pace (it's tricky!) I can keep the HR in 170-175 and run like this for 45 minutes or so.  Is this me simply being extremely unfit? :) Is it likely to improve if I keep running in this zone? I can't really run any slower, and fast walking at the same speed gets me an HR of 125, which I also don't feel will improve my fitness unless done for several hours a day. "
1075,Is there any point to these kinds of exercises to employ bone remodelling and Wolff's Law?,"For those of you who can't or aren't inclined to watch the video, it is a presentation by a martial arts instructor who shows various exercises you can do with a wooden rod.  He basically hits himself lightly on various parts of his body.  The idea is that this will cause bone remodeling, which will improve bone density to the parts of the body that he applies the exercises to.  I'm guessing this is related to martial arts practices where, as I understand it, students practice kicking at trees and punching planks of wood in order to develop ""toughness"".  Is there any point to these kinds of exercises?  Are they practical and beneficial?  Is there a particular program that is reputable for knowing how often and in what manner these kinds of exercises can be trained for?  My aim is to determine whether these kinds of ""contact exercises"" could do me some good, beyond the lame calisthenic exercises that I resort to these days.  I'm 31, 225 lbs, 6' 1"", and wouldn't mind some added bone density, especially as I age.  Right now going to the gym isn't a realistic possibility.  Here's the video: [website]"
1076,Nutrition & diet - what is the ideal BMI range for children between 6 and 12?,"The 6-12 year age group is in a latent period of growth, while children 12-18 years old experience their main period of growth. The usual BMI range is 18 to 23. But is it applicable to children who are 6 to 12 years old?  Sometimes with higher income groups I also find children with lower BMI scores - for example, 13. Sometimes children do not show any significant symptoms, or they have low haemoglobin counts in blood tests. And childhood obesity is becoming more common. So is it useful to take BMI into consideration to determine a balanced diet for a child of this age group? What BMI range should be considered as optimum for children below 12? "
1077,Is there such a thing as a minimum amount of exercise per week?,"To be healthy, we're supposed to exercise at least x hours a week, one can read here and there. But does it depend on the person? Does it have to be divided into daily pieces or can it safely be packed into saturday + sunday for instance? And what would be the safest figure for the minimum weekly amoung of exercise for securing optimal health? "
1078,Is sleep and rest is necessary for developing my body structure?,"I go to the gym 4 days a week and rest on the remaining days. Is it necessary to take a break like this?   If I rest today, that means that tomorrow I can work hard compared to other days. I think  this is due to taking rest. Is that true?   I also feel those days when I don't sleep properly that I cant take work out more. I read an article they suggested sleep and rest. Is it really necessary to rest and sleep? How many hours do I need to sleep per day? "
1079,Are Body proportions Charts Realistic?,"What do you guys think of this Ideal Body Proportions Chart.  It tells me what I have always thought and that is my upper body needs to get bigger.  But it also says that my legs are too big by .75 inches.  I've never been sure if maybe I should work my legs more to increase their size, this chart says no, but a girl just this week told me to not forget to work my lower body, too. Which seems to suggest my lower body may be too straight and slim.  My weight (201 lbs) to height (5'10"") ratio is: 2.90  Below are their/my numbers:   Neck: 17.50/15.50 Biceps: 16.45/15.372 Forearm: 13.70/11.625 Chest: 45.70/43.00 Waist: 34.25/37.25 - no judging. :-P Hips: 41.10/41.625 Thigh: 24.65/24.75 Calf: 16.45/16.50   One measurement that is missing is shoulders which depends on your deltoids which can't be measured individually.  Also, how do you measure traps? Or would the extra weight of the trap muscles force to increase of the other muscle proportions in the chart.  Lastly, who actually takes this chart seriously.  I've seen it displayed in a few sites.  Update: Ok, did some research and found this for shoulders. And this seems to point to the Golden Ratio of 1.618.  THE QUESTION:  Is it realistic to follow the above body proportions chart?  Or should I use my own judgement? "
1080,Can 3 days training to fail per week cause over-training?,"​I'm a beginner and I started lifting weights at the beginning of this year. I do workout 3 days per week (Sun, Tue, and Thu) I kept that up over the past two and half months. When I do lifting, I focus on specific muscle groups, that is a day for legs, a day for chest and arms, a day for my back and a day for my abs. So, there will be a muscle group won't be trained in a week (legs or abs).  I train for 30 minutes, where I push myself as best as I can, and I switch between machines targeting a different group of muscles, so I don't just sit down on a machine waiting to rest. For example, I switch between biceps and triceps machines. And I usually, train myself to the point I fail to do anything (where my muscles completely stuck and cannot move).   I noticed that on the night after training (I train before afternoon) that I don't sleep well, and recently I completely get into insomnia issue. For example, yesterday was an abs day and I couldn't sleep for 3 hours! I tried to increase my carbs intake but it didn't work, so I'm wondering what the possibility that I'm overtraining myself?   Should I take a week rest or so? I watched this video from a channel I like. However, I'm afraid if I do that, that I will lose my motivation and stop keeping my protein synthesis on fire!  I usually stay calories deficit, but I'm taking no less than 90 grams of protein. My weight is 73 kg and 1.78 cm tall (and no, I'm not thin, there is some fat around my waist.. skinny fat? maybe I'm not sure)  Please let me know If I'm doing anything wrong here.  ​ "
1081,How to incorporate cardio in to a barbell routine?,"I lift M-W-F. On A days I would do back squats, bench presses, power cleans, and push ups. On B days I would do back squats, overhead presses, deadlifts, and pull ups.  This is all fine but if I want to be aerobically fit as well I want to incorporate some form of cardiovascular exercise. I need some help incorporating this in to my workout routine.  I definitely do not want to do any form of cardio before my lifts because I do not want to gimp my lifts or form. Afterwards is a possibility but I cannot exercise for too long or I could risk my body going in to a catabolic state. Also, I'm usually pretty tired after my lifts. I don't really want to do cardio on off days either because my muscles should be resting on those days. Also, I could lose a lot of motivation having to work out five or six times a week.  When should I perform cardio while under a M-W-F barbell program? What forms of cardio are recommended? Does anyone have any insight in to HIIT or any other varying cardio workouts? If overall fitness, strength, and health is my goal then how should I handle this problem? Thanks! "
1082,Shoulder isolation exercises,"Background  My shoulders have some catching up to do, compared to the rest of my torso, and I'm set on doing more overhead presses to have my compound exercises geared towards defining shoulders more.  However, I need some inspiration for shoulder isolation exercises.  Question  What are some isolation exercises that will facilitate building broader shoulders?  My own mind goes straight to the front/side/rear deltoids, but I definitely feel like there are some other muscles that help build defined shoulders. If so, which muscles would that be, and how would I target them? "
1083,Are squats necessary to reduce body weight?,"My partner told me that squats are a basic exercise, that it helps to improve the lungs so you should do squats daily to lift huge weights. Is this true? Are squat exercises helpful to reduce our body weight and belly?  "
1084,plastic foil to lose belly fat faster,"I have seen people in the gym wrapping their lower belly in plastic foil. They claim it burns the fat in that area faster.  I wonder if this is actually contributing to a faster loss of belly fat, and if it is not harmful to wrap your body in plastic foil - not letting it breathe in that area whilst working out ?  I'm having second thoughts, because it is the principal of a sauna, i think. Sauna does not burn any fat as well, it makes you lose fluids, more than fat. Allthough I can see some sense in burning fat faster because the area underneath the foil gets hotter.  Is there anyone who could provide me with some information from a scientific point of view ? "
1085,Practical applications of the earthquake/bamboo bar,"My gym recently purchased this weird bar:    I have yet to see anyone actually use it.  From what I can tell, the point is to hang weights off the sides and they swing at each rep. The idea (I guess) is to make the bar unstable.  However, it seems to me that, as it pertains to strength training, using a bar like this would either have too much weight to be safe or not enough weight to be very effective.  What use does this type of bar have? What would be an effective way of using it? "
1086,What can cause an unexpected weight gain with constant workouts and calorie control?,"I am trying to shift a lot of fat, and I have started to up my game. I am working out 4 times a week on weights (1 hour sessions), and trying to go for 2 30-40 minute runs on top of that.  On top of that I am tracking calories using Livestrong app, and have been under target for a fortnight.  The first week I lost 5lb, great news.  This week I have gains 7lb!!! What could I have missed? My calories are being tightly controlled, I am exercising much more. How can it go up?  I weigh myself on Friday mornings, after my morning 'movement'. "
1087,Residual fat: can all fat be dealt with?,"Is there such a thing as residual fat? That means, fat that will stay there in your belly, thighs or other place? Does your body save fat just for emergencies?   It might sound as a silly question, but this is a pretty demotivating thought of mine when dieting or doing physical exercise. I always think that I won't manage to have a flat belly, no matter how hard I try. Maybe my body only lets me reduce my fat up to x% before getting sick and leaves my belly fat untouched. "
1088,What should hands do during Barbell Squats?,"I normally just leave my hands hanging on the bar while I squat, however I sometimes find myself pulling the bar downwards or pushing the bar upwards. When I push the bar with my hands, the weight feels lighter. I'm not sure if there are any benefits to this or if it is just psychological, after all, the weight is still being lifted by my legs, right? I try not to do anything with my hands, but I sometimes grind that last rep using this technique.  Should I push the bar up with my hands, pull it down on my back or not do anything during a rep? What are the advantages and disadvantages of each one. "
1089,Elliptical trainers unkind on my upper body muscles?,"I alternate concentration on my arms, belly and legs in that order. That is, I push with my arms till they are tired, then fall back to core till they are tired and fall back to legs.  But I feel aches around the scapula region and above-cavicle region which go away only if I skip the machine for two days. It seems fatiguing to those muscles too. I also get muscle aches around lower back if I am not careful.  Am I putting myself in harm by actively using my arms? Should I use arms only for support? Is there a better warmup for the upper body? "
1090,"My wrists and fore-arms hurt, what should I do?","I weight lifts daily and also do parkour and I tend to have problems with my wrists and forearms (edit: specifically it's my right wrist and my left forearm. my left wrist is completely OK and my right forearm is completely OK), especially when performing a back handspring my arms hurt a lot, but also when lifting weights, for example when exercising biceps, the wrist of my right arm is killing me.  The pain is present only during the activity itself and nothing hurts when not exercising. An elastic bandage tends to help a lot, so, my questions are:   Should I use elastic bandages to tighten my wrist and hope that one day I won't need them, or will they cause me more trouble than they will help me? What else should I do to help my arms get used to heavy activities like this? What exercises should I do either before the training or during the training to exercise my wrists/arms to get stronger? Should I use bandages while doing so?   Disclaimer: I don't consider my life being in danger and I don't see this as a serious health issue. I know that I should see a doctor when in need of a medical attention. I just want the opinion of experienced people in the field. I am not replacing my doctor by this community. I hope all is OK and understood, as once on another stackexchange site, people refused to answer my question, not wanting to take the responsibility for my health. This is not the case.  EDIT: Current solution in the answers saying ""try to give your body 48-72 hours of restitution between workouts"" is not an acceptable solution (in my case). There are days when because of work I cannot do any physical activity at all - sometimes it's even up to 7 days of a complete rest for my body - and yet, when I get ""back to working out"", my wrist starts to hurt the same way again. Not immediately, but after for example doing a bridge or a back handspring. "
1091,Is my modified Stronglifts 5X5 a balanced one?,"I have undergoing rehab for knee, elbow and shoulder injuries right now for having used poor form and more importantly pushing myself hard for too little muscle mass that I have. Previously I was doing Jillian Michaels' workout videos and some yoga dvds'.  I guess it's high time to gain muscle mass after I recover. Earlier I used to workout with very light dumbell, never lifted heavy before. Will I benefit with the novice effect while doing Stronglifts 5X5?  I can't afford bench/power cage, so can I replace barbell squats with goblet squat and bench press with floor dumbell press without making the program unbalanced in any way?  Are warm up sets the only warm up preceeding the workout?  Edited to add: I'm 25 YO female, stand 5' 4.5"" tall and weigh 100 lbs (I am an ectomorph basically). I tend to eat 1600-2000 calories when I'm active. Now lesser since I'm all sedentary except for the rehab. I have been working out since 1.5 years. Was active (martial arts) for 3.5 years before but stopped due to hectic schedule/laziness/excuses... "
1092,Fat burning supplements and their efficacy,"I understand that the general consensus is that one should rather rely on exercise/training and proper nutrition to lose fat.  However, I'm wondering what else can be used to accelerate this process. I've heard that ECA stacks are sort of risky (and ephedrine is illegal in the US now). What do people use to accelerate such processes these days?  I did a little bit of research on google scholar, and the only supplement which seems to have some scientific papers on it are green tea extracts, but I've only done a little amount of search.  Are there any other supplements which can help the fat loss process? "
1093,Why do I get cramps all the time?,"Fairly often, I get cramps that are really painful. I've noticed that there seem to be 2 different varieties of these cramps.   Random Foot Cramps - these are just cramps that I get in either of my foot in the arch or near the balls of my toes that just happen at random times. Most of the time to alleviate them, I just walk around for a while and it will go away, but I usually have to take my shoes off Not so random other muscle cramps - these ones make a bit more sense. Basically if I hold some kind of pose for a while (say, a stretch, or the finish position of a crunch) then whatever muscle is involved will start to cramp up and i'll have to snap back to my normal standing or lying position to make the pain stop.   What could be causing these cramps? Could it be that I'm too inflexible to be doing some of these movements? Or maybe I'm lacking some kind of nutrient in my diet? (Diet info: I'm ""paleo"" so I eat a ton of chicken and beef, and also a sizable quantity of vegetables like broccoli, sweet potatoes, and carrots) Or maybe this is just a normal thing and I'm just being a baby? "
1094,How can I gain a lot of weight in one month?,"I want to gain around 10 kg in one month, is this possible?  If so, what would be the healthiest way of doing so?  I'm 23 years old and weigh 56 kg with a height of ~6 ft. "
1095,Is it better to start exercising with a program/dvd or running/walking/etc?,I want to start exercising but not sure the right approach. I don't want to over do it by doing too much at first since I don't already have a routine.   Would it be better to start off with a dvd program or would it be better to do short walks/runs and increase? Any techniques that others have tried and worked to help them start and keep a routine?   Any help would be appreciated! I hope this is the right place to ask this question!   Thanks! 
1096,How to create a workout plan?,"How do you create your workout plan? How do you know when to increase your reps or stay the same? Do you use spreadsheets or other tools?  How do you keep track of your progress? Since I'm a bit of a nerd and I enjoy web 2.0, are there any online interactive websites that you use to create and track workout plans? "
1097,Differences between round plates and octagonal plates?,"From the Stronglifts 5x5 Report (Page 44):     By the way, if your gym doesn't have round plates […], switch gym. You can't   Deadlift/Row correctly with octagonal plates.   What makes round plates superior? Is there even any truth to this claim or is it just a personal preference of the author? Are there advantages of using octagonal plates? "
1098,After workout: meal or protein shake or both?,"Im a little unsure about one thing. After the weightlifting, should I have only meal or both the meal and shake?   My shake is: 30gram protein and 227 cals. My meal is around: 500 cals, 32 gram protein and half avocado + 1 glass milk or water. I eat 5 meals per day. 500 cals each.  Am I not wasting if I intake both of them?  "
1099,What are symptoms of climber's finger,"I am a new rock climber at the age of 30 and I have been climbing (and bouldering) twice a week for two months now (one session bouldering and one session in the wall).  I have lately been feeling some soreness around the A2 and A3 pulley (see figure) below.  The symptoms I experience is a strange stiffness in the morning which makes it hard to bend my fingers, and when they bend, it feels somewhat strange, as if something was moving around in the A2/C1/A3 area.  The same area is also slightly tender.  However, I have no pain in these areas while climbing.   Figure courtesy of Training for Climbing, by Eric J. Horst (via  Finger Tendon Pulley Injury).  My question is therefore:     What are symptoms of climber's finger?   I want to continue climbing, as often as possible, and at least twice a week.  But is this sustainable, given the current situation, or do I need to take a break from climbing? "
1100,How accurate is the Navy Body Fat Calculator?,"I've been using the Navy Body Fat Calculation method for about two months in conjunction with an exercise regimen. It's done it's job as far as telling me that I'm loosing body fat and gaining lean muscle in it's place, but I still wonder how accurate it is and can be.  From everything I've read on the net, the general consensus is that it's accurate to within 3% of what Hydrostatic Weighing gives you, but I've noticed something about it's output, namely that my neck measurement has more of a (reverse) hold on what my BFP is than my waist measurement does.  For example:   If my waist measurement increases size 1/8th of an inch (which would indicate a gain of BFP), but my neck measurement increases by 3/8ths of an inch, then my BFP is calculated as losing .61 percentage points. On the other hand, if my waist measurement stays the same (which indicates no change), and my neck measurement decreases by 1/2 inch, my BFP is calculated as gaining a half a percentage point.   I understand I'm being nit-picky here, as it is telling me that over the past two months I've lost about 4% (coming up on 5%) in BFP, but wouldn't my waist have more weight in the calculation of what my body fat is doing than my neck? The way it is now it seems kind ass backwards, pardon the french.  Was this built into the Navy algorithm? Does this make it inaccurate?  "
1101,How harmful is the sun in a late afternoon to a run?,"I live in a hot and humid climate (Tel Aviv), and usually I run at night. But some days I have plans in the evening, and my only chance to get a run in is by starting at around six, six-thirty (which in summer is about an hour before sunset).  How bad is this, in terms of exposure to the sun? I don't normally apply sunscreen for such runs. By the time I finish (about an hour) the sun is almost setting (or has set).  A final detail: let's say I do this about once a month - run at six in the evening, without applying sunscreen. Is that below the threshold that I should be concerned about? "
1102,Elbow Tendonitis,I lift Heavy (amateur strongman).  I have been struggling with tendonitis in my left elbow.  I believe I have the cause narrowed down to my squatting.  I am currently doing my 5x5 at around 500 lbs.  I have thought that maybe this is due to shoulder mobility (Though I can overhead squat fine.)  Is this the reason that people use spider squat bar?  How can I reduce the pain and cause of my tendonitis? 
1103,Is it safe to do jogging on asphalt?,"I do jogging every day in the morning. I have a river near my house with an asphalt (bitumen) road along it. I heard, that people ruin their knees and acquire hernias on such surface. Unfortunately i have no rough terrain or stadium tracks nearby. How safe is it to run daily above the asphalt covering? Should it be prohibited at all, or i can mitigate by proper techniques and certain shoes?  If the latter is true, i'm interested in the techniques and shoes in detail.  Please provide reliable and verifiable sources, because different people tell different opinions.  (This is not a duplicate of Can I run barefeet on asphalt?, because i can't allow myself running barefoot in my environment) "
1104,Any Good workout plan for beginner?,"I am a beginner in working out and building muscles. I am skinny and have no muscles at all, but I want to start working out, so I could get muscles and get strong. Are there any good workout programs with videos for beginners? Programs for building muscles and strength? I do push ups and sit ups, and pull ups, but I want more intense stuff. Like weightlifting.  Is there any weightlifting programs that involves a full body workout (chest, shoulders, back, biceps, triceps, legs,abs,..)? "
1105,How often does running or weight lifting cause capillary bursts?,"I exercise every alternate day - which means 7 times a fortnight. I mix it up ever so often, but I generally do a mixture of about 45 minutes of cardio (either a run at >10.5 or intervals on the elliptical at l8), plus about 20-25 minutes weights plus static.   This pattern has been pretty constant for the last 6 years - I consider myself relatively fit and healthy. However, I've noticed in the last couple of years that I've been getting bruises on my arms and legs. it's about 4-5 on the left leg and 2-3 on the right - mostly on the calves. And recently a few on my upper arms.   The spots vary in colour day-to-day, from pink to light brown to purple, and I am quite fair so it shows. When I press on them, they will disappear for a bit, and then reappear.   Besides the aesthetic unpleasantness, I am wondering how common these are. I am guessing they are capillary bursts - but does anyone have anything similar? It doesn't appear to be a skin condition, and I know definitely that they aren't the result of bumps. And does anyone know how they happen? My guess is that perhaps they happen when I exert myself while running/weight-training.   Thanks! "
1106,Stronglifts Adaptation Questions,"I'm currently doing StrongLifts however I have changed the bench &amp; squat parameters to 5x8 instead of 5x5. I've also added in some accessory stuff (flies, curls, skull crushers, pull-ups on days I am using similar muscles) &amp; some cardio (running/bike 2-3 miles 3 times a week).  Things have been going well for the last 7 weeks, meeting all targets so far however I think sooner or later I will plateau on certain exercises (I reckon on the bench first seeing as its most difficult for me! Although it is my favourite!).   Is my 5x8 adaptation a good or bad idea? What difference will 5x8 have on my progress compared to 5x5? Will the addition of accessory work effect my strength? When a plateau aries what kind of things can I do to my program?   Goals = Strong good looking physique  My first question yeah!  Original program Link: [website]"
1107,What is the optimal sleep schedule for bodybuilding?,"To find the perfect sleep schedule for bodybuilding, I think we should look at the top professional bodybuilders. 4 time Mr. Olympia Jay Cutler said in a Q&amp;A session that he gets 8-9 hours of sleep in the off-season, but only 4 hours while preparing for a contest. I have two questions about this style of bodybuilding sleep schedule:   Why does he change his hours of sleep depending on the season? By sleeping 8-9 hours in the off-season, Jay Cutler is somewhere in the ""long sleepers"" range according to this poster. Is he putting on unnecessary fat as the poster says or does the poster only apply to sedentary people?  "
1108,"Less sleep the night before, in order to sleep more the night after a strength workout","I know about the importance of good sleep after strength workouts, due to the release of growth hormone during deep sleep.  No matter how hard I try, my body refuses to sleep more than 6 hours. Going to bed early only means I will wake up spontaneously before the alarm clock. The only exception happens when I sleep two hours or less (not often), then my body will allow me to sleep for 8 or 9 hours the following day.  A few days ago I had my strength training session after having slept only 2 hours. I didn´t perform much worse than usually. Interestingly, since I had some sleep debt I could go to bed early that night and get 9 hours of natural post-workout sleep!  Which leads me to the following: perhaps it is not a bad idea to restrict your sleep time the night before a workout, so that you get more sleep the night before, just before having exposed your muscles to micro-trauma in the Gym.  Is that a known method? Is it unhealthy? "
1109,"What did I do to my knee, and how should I recover?","First, let me make it clear that this doesn't feel like bad pain. It feels more like an overtraining/overuse type pain. If this were bad pain I'd be going straight to a doctor or physical therapist.  My Background/Physiology   30 year old male Very active in high school/college ('95-'03)   Including football, baseball, basketball, wrestling, track, and cross country  Ran marathons from 2005-2007 Sedentary from 2007 until February 2011 6' tall, 215 lbs, 23.4% body fat (target weight: 185 lbs) Large frame (8"" wrist circumfrence) Limited flexibility   In late February I began basic cardio focused workouts at the office gym. I did this for about 3 weeks and I started going to a CrossFit gym a little over 5 days a week (3 on 1 off). This gym's CrossFit style workouts are very beginner centric and rarely include more than 15 reps of anything. I have been working at home on my flexibility and mobility doing many of the exercises shown on the Mobility WOD.  Diet/Supplementation  I take daily multivitamin and fish-oil supplements. I'm currently eating a high protein, high fat, low-ish carb diet. My carb sources are primarily bananas, apples, and sweet potatoes. Basically paleo, but I cheat one day a week.   Thirty minutes before each workout I drink a pre-workout amino acid cocktail which includes Beta-alanine, L-Leucine, L-Isoleucine, L-Valine, L-Arginine, L-Taurine, L-Carnitine, alpha-Ketoglutarate, and Citrulline. Within 15 minutes of finishing each workout I drink a combination of a protein mix and a post-workout amino acid elixir which includes L-Glutamine, L-Leucine, L-Isoleucine, L-Valine, L-Arginine, and Citrulline.  With this diet and supplementation I have never experienced significant soreness the day after a workout, except for the first week of CrossFit. Even on days where I killed my back due to my poor clean form I have been fine the next day.  Get to the Point  Yesterday's workout was as follows:  2RFT   10 pullups 100m sprint 10 jumping squats 100m sprint 10 push ups 100m sprint 10 box jumps 100m sprint 10 dead lifts (175#) 100m sprint 10 jumping lunges 100m sprint   I completed it in just over 16 minutes. I was definitely gassed halfway through the second round. My sprints had become a jogging shuffle, and I had to do regular lunges in place of jumping lunges. This was definitely not the most intense workout I have done, but it did have more jumping than usual. After the workout my quads and calves were sore, but not exceptionally so.  I woke up this morning with a very very stiff right knee. It hurts to put it into full extension, and it hurts even more to bear weight on it in full extension. With my knee slightly bent everything is fine. After I have sat at my desk for a bit with my knee at 90 degrees I cannot walk very well for the first minute. I have a distinct limp. After about a minute or two of walking it is more or less fine as long as I avoid full extension (I don't normally lock my knees out when walking anyway). The pain is focused on the medial and lateral sides of my lower knee, maybe even below the actual knee.  Let me show you where it hurts:    I should mention that the pain is also triggered when my knee is in extreme flexion, and also with my hip in simultaneous flexion, abduction, and lateral rotation. That last picture demonstrates this: flexing my knee as far as it can go and cranking my ankle up towards my chin.  I don't feel any point tenderness anywhere on my knees. I've pressed and poked everywhere with rather extreme force and have felt no tenderness. Almost forgot, when my knee is in full extension I felt some slight discomfort on the medial side at the end of my hamstring behind my knee. I can bounce on my toes flexing both my ankles and knees on landing without feeling pain, as long as I avoid full extension.  Question(s)  So is this just an overuse injury? Is it even an injury or just fatigue? Does it have a name? What could have caused this: the jumping, the running? Thankfully today is my rest day, so I have all day today, and most of tomorrow to recover.  What should I avoid or try to be aware of during my workouts to prevent this?  Misc. Stuff that might be relevant  I've been working out in Vibram FiveFingers for the past week and a half. I have had to adapt my running gait to accomodate this. I was previously a heel striker, which is impossible in barefoot shoes, so I'm now trying to do a forefoot strike. I can definitely feel the difference in my calves.  Also, I obsessively roll out my muscles before and after every workout using both The Stick and a Rumble Roller. After last night's workout I think I did neglect my calves a bit, because they didn't feel that bad. I focused on my quads back and glutes. "
1110,"Hit my fat percentage wall, help me out I would give it all","I think I have hit my fat percentage wall. I weigh between 175-178 lbs and my body fat percentage is consistently 22-28%. Here is my routine. I crossfit in the morning,  so I get some good cardio. I try to run 0.5 - 1 mile at a pace of 6 mph. I then do bench press or dead Max 2-3 days per week by myself.  I consume lots of water. I eat paleo 5 days a week. I eat cheat meals like pizza or high carb burger or burrito for just 3 meals a week. Despite all these my body fat % remains the same. It never goes below 23. I want it to bring 18 or under in 2 months. What am I doing wrong? What can I do different to break this wall?   Update:  I am male, 27, weight 175-178, height 5'10"". I do crossfit, other than that I lift a little bit of weight. Bench press Max - 130. Dead lift Max - 215.  "
1111,Can some people just not exercise very much? Do some people become overtrained at typical levels of exercise?,"I am very interested in fitness and I have done a lot of training in the past (both cardio and strength). However, I become overtrained very, very easily. When I get overtrained I become extremely fatigued, I have trouble sleeping, I get headaches, I get run down and sometimes I get sick. Therefore, I have to limit my training and this limits my progress and what I am ultimately capable of achieving.  For example, on a background of steady cardio (such as cycling) I started running 3 years ago. I can run 45-50 miles in a month without much problem and I can run 60 miles if I am really careful (in terms of rest and not pushing too hard in my training). Earlier this year I ran 75 miles in a month and it made me overtrained and it took me months to recover from that.  The last few months I have been running 50 to 60 miles each month and this month I finally felt ready to try to step it up again. At almost the middle of the month I have run 36 miles so far. This week I ran or walked 5 days in a row, managing each session so as not to overdo it. However, during yesterday's run I realized I was feeling drained, so I backed off and walked part of the way and cut the distance short. However, by bedtime it was evident that I had become overtrained. Sleeping was very difficult and today I have no energy to do anything. I feel drained and extremely fatigued.  I have been this way my entire life (since I was a teenager). I have been checked by many general doctors and nothing obvious shows up. I don't have any recognizable diseases or even anything obviously wrong according to basic medical examinations. Furthermore, because of my desire to be fit I eat better and follow a healthier lifestyle than any of my friends. The problem most certainly is not a poor diet or lifestyle.  Most people I know who have worse diets and lifestyle are able to training much harder than I can.  It seems to me that I would never be able to run a marathon (or even a half marathon) given the limitations in the amount of training my body can handle. I just could not follow any of the half marathon training programs I have seen without quickly becoming overtrained. The same limitations have been present for any type of physical training I have attempted. I had to give up a sport I loved because even through I had athletic talent for it, I did not have the stamina and I could not find any solution for getting the stamina. (Again, the typical training routines were far too much for me to handle.)  Should I just accept that my body cannot handle much exercise? Or should I go for some really advanced medical tests? If so, any ideas about what should be tested? (I had a treadmill stress test a couple years ago and passed that with flying colors. The doctor remarked on my excellent physical fitness!) "
1112,Alternating exercise to get faster fitness gains,"In roughly 12 weeks I am going on an alpine mountaineering holiday with friends. I'm sure that the fitter I am the more I will enjoy it. I've started doing the couch to 5k program to improve my fitness as I'm told that running is the most time-effective form of exercise.  I'd like to know what, if any, exercise I could do between my running days to gain fitness faster? There is a gym I can use locally, but most CV type exercises involve the legs, rowing or swimming may be alternatives? Is it a good idea or will I just fail to recover? "
1113,Effects of adjusting set range instead of rep range,"Background:  There's constant talk about how low rep-ranges favor strength gains, while high rep-ranges favor size gains. At least, that's the general consensus, it seems.  During my last few sessions, I've stepped down my rep-range from 3x8 and into 5x5. But I was thinking...  Question:  We generally agree on the effects of adjusting your rep-range, but what about adjusting the set-range?  For instance, what would be the effects of going from a 3x3 scheme, to a 5x3 or an 8x3 scheme? (For the record, that's sets x reps. Just to prevent any possible confusion.)  In this case, one might probably lift pretty heavy for the first 3-4 sets (assuming proper warm-up before first set), and then drop the weight slightly while still doing 3 reps every time.  Would you once again be doing hypertrophy training? "
1114,Why is my big calorie deficit not resulting in weight loss?,"About 6-8 weeks ago I started have a green drink/protein shake for breakfast lunch and sometimes dinner. I eat meals on the weekends. I have a few beers. I exercise 5-6 days a week, usually during about 400-500 calories doing some form of cardio and also light weights 2-3 time per week. I was 211 lbs when I started and went to about 199 lbs in 2 weeks or so. Pretty much same routine over the next 6 weeks but weight hasn't budged one bit. My calorie intake is much lower than before the shakes and I am exercising more...why am I not losing weight?  The shake consists of 1 scoop of each of these + 12oz water, ice and a banana: [website][website]"
1115,Heart Rate (bpm) vs Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR) ?,"This question has to do with the relationship between your BMR and resting heart rate (bpm). If you are training daily, aerobic and anabolic, and after a span of time you see a decrease in your bpm would your BMR also decrease due to the more efficient bpm ?   For example, you have a BMR of 1800 and after 3 months of intense cardio and weight training you decrease your bpm from 70 to 55 would this result in a decrease of your BMR ? "
1116,Is it possible to gain health benefits by following a calisthenics routine for a very sedentary person?,"I am in the 30's and I admit to be very sedentary. Worse of all, with a hectic work schedule, a family with small kids it is very difficult (or impossible?) to find the time for a proper exercising without a complete life revolution, which is not possible now.  Still, I think that doing absolutely zero physical exercise is not good and will be worse the more time I let pass.   So I started thinking about doing at least something, in the only moment that I can think of: in the early morning, when everybody else is still sleeping. So ideally (?) I would get up at 6 am, do .. something? for some time, then begin the normal day (and, like the internet meme goes, profit!).  The question is: is this meaningful at all? can it really provide me with some health benefits? And what would be the magical ""something"" that I could do by myself in the living room without waking up wife and babies? I am thinking about some calisthenics but maybe I am so completely off that I don't even notice it. "
1117,Different in exercises between two 100pushups sites,"I have found two different sites guiding how to achieve 100 push ups: HundredPushups.com and Alternative100Pushups.com. However they have different schedule. For example, if you get into the 11-20 pushups round in your first test, numbers of pushups in each set W1D1 in HundredPushups.com are 10 12 7 7 and max (at least 9), meanwhile in Alternative100Pushups.com are 8 9 7 7 and max (at least 8). Do you know why there is a derivation? Which plan should I stick to? "
1118,Does running cause menstrual-style cramps?,"I'm a new runner (a few weeks in) and not due to start my period for another week. I had to stop a mile in today because I got a ghost cramps out of nowhere and REALLY wanted a vicodin. (It was contemplating-getting-in-the fetal-position-in-the-middle-of-the-trail type pain) I thought I started my period. Of course, as I was about half way limping back to my car (10 mins?) it passed and I felt completely fine. I then sprinted back to my car so I could make it home before the next one came. The thing is, it was a ghost cramp. I haven't started my period. What gives? I'm always well hydrated so I know it's not that.   In addition to going to the doctor, I just want to know:  Is this normal? Can it be avoided? Should I start taking painkillers before I run? "
1119,Can I reach a target strength using high reps of lower weights?,"I think the answer is ""No.""  So here goes:  I want to lift 60 pounds smoothly about 45 times in an hour (to assist with archery target practice with 60 pound bow).    Right now I can only lift 60 pounds about 5 times before I start shaking (read: overbowed).  Once I reach this goal, it is not necessary for me to continue growing in strength or endurance.  Is it possible to train with weights that are around 20 to 40 pounds and reach the stated goal?  Or is it inevitable that eventually I have to work out with 60 pound weights? "
1120,Why is my body shaking during certain exercises?,"During some exercises (push-ups, crunshes) my whole body shakes, I feel a tremor that I cannot control. This happens even during first push-up, when I'm not tired at at all. So, my questions are:   What could be a reason for this? Does this tremor affect the efficiency of my workout? Should I be trying to control it, and if yes, how?   I'm 37, and started working out recently after a long period without any physical activity. "
1121,Is there a way to prevent swollen feet from barefoot running?,"I'm doing barefoot running on streets (tarmac) for approximately one month now. In this time I had several blisters, scratches and pain in the ankle. Now everything works pretty fine, except my feet are swelling in the back.  Before I started barefoot running, I did not have swollen feet. Has anybody got some information about this for me?  What is in this swelling, water?  I read somewhere that - if you start running barefoot, your foot muscles develop and get ""bigger""? How is barefoot running and swollen feet related to each other? Is there a way to prevent it?  Update: Thanks alot, jmort253, for your answer. It was very interesting to learn from your answer, that there are 20 muscles in the feet and only 2 are ""execised"" when you walk/run with shoes. The swelling comes with no pain at all. Yesterday I put my feet for 20 minutes into water that has around 16 degrees celcius (60 degrees fahrenheit). That was very good for my feet. And I have the impression that the swelling decreased. When I have pain in my feet (apart from some little scars), I do not run, but walk. "
1122,Is my training working for me,"I am finding that my hard runs (5.31min/km) my avg HR is around 160, but I am not running to exhaustion by any means, and recover pretty well after 10min rest or so.  Usually use a harder negative split (5.15 min/km) for last 2 km.  Am i running too hard for my age? Should I back off my training?   60yr old male - fairly unfit 12 months ago - 91kg, 172cm started walking/jogging and reducing calorie intake Introduced running 6mnths ago - around 15km/week Added gym (stretches/weights/rowing) 3 months ago, around a 55min session -4/week increasing running (3xweek) up to 25km/week   Currently working as 4x per week at gym (55 mins) and 3x per week running (up to 25km total)  I am now down to 78kg, and resting HR is around 64bpm (via fitbit)  I aim for one hard run/week (7km), one longer run (60 minutes), and one easier run 7km in around 45minutes "
1123,"Just starting, having problems with knees/ankles","I'm just starting a workout program at 25 years old really for the first time.  I have a bit of a routine going, involving the treadmill, arm and leg presses etc, and the stationary bike.    My problem is that my knees seem to ""lock"" (feel very stiff) when I get off the bike, and my knees and ankles start to hurt after a few minutes on the treadmill.  Any suggestions on how I can reduce these annoyances?  Do I need to re-arrange my routine? "
1124,How to do Trunk Extensions without a Medicine Ball,"included in the exercise regimen I've been trying to do is trunk extensions for lower back muscles. in almost all the examples I've seen for trunk extensions, they are done on a medicine ball.  I do not have a medicine ball, so I was wondering what any recommended alternatives are. Can I do it just laying on my stomach on the ground? Should I try it laying off the edge of my bed?  Thanks in advance! "
1125,Should I change my diet based on rice and vegetables?,"I'm a very busy person so I can't spend an hour a day cooking things, so six month ago I made a method which consisted of having vegetables already cut in the fridge and every time I need to eat I just cook rice with a rice cooker and add those.   this takes me 5 mins per meals and it's a huge time gainer but I fear this is not the best thing to do. I'm not really good at nutrition so I kind of have no idea of what I'm doing.  Right now I basically eat for dinner :   300 gr of rice with 100 gr of quinoa 1 Cup  of carrots and Broccoli 100 gr of lentils    I've been eating this for 6 month and I don't really mind but I classify myself as an ectomorph and I can't seem to gain weight with this.  should I change it ? And if so, how ?   Ps : I know this meal looks like a vegetarian's one but I'm not, I just find it convenient.  Thanks a lot in advance !    edit : Thanks for the answers, you raised a lot of imprecisions in my first post, so here you can find some more info :   at breakfast I usually drink a milkshake of :   One banana 70 gr of this : [website]The issue is that at lunch I eat a lot of various things as I have to eat with my coworkers but it's usually the fish of the day (around 150 gr of it) with vegetables and rice After workout I drink this ( one cup) : [website]I'm 20, I am 1m84 tall for 68 kg and I sleep 6 hours a day   I go to the gym 2 days a week for upper and lower body using freeletics for the actual program. "
1126,Reduce sweat rate?,"Does anyone know how to reduce one's sweat rate?  Currently I lose about 3lbs of sweat an hour when I run, even on mild days where the temp. is around 60-70 degrees.  As I'm training for ultras, I'd like to reduce that rate if possible.  I believe I can take electrolyte pills, but unaware how effective they are and how they impact sweat rate.  UPDATE:  Someone mentioned that electrolyte tablets can reduce the amount of sweat you lose during exercise.  Is this true or do those only help you keep your sodium levels up? "
1127,Impact of weekly collossal cheat days,"I know a guy who follows a very strict diet and trains regularly, but once a week he will have an extremely indulgent cheat day (5,000-10,000 calories, typically ice-cream-based).  How does this impact your health on a physical level? On a mental level? Is this safe?  I am looking for short-term and long-term answers. "
1128,Deadlift form and individual morphometry,"I'm a beginner lifter (female) doing Starting Strength. I'm having a problem with my deadlift form that I think might be partly related to individual morphometry.  So, what happens is this: I set up as described in Rippetoe's SS with the bar at midfoot. I take my grip. I bend my knees until my shins touch the bar. Because I have (very) disproportionately long thighbones compared to the length of my torso and shin bones, this puts my hips quite low, my back at about a 45-degree angle to the floor, and my knees jutting pretty far out over the bar. It's a very awkward arrangement. When I start to pull, inevitably my knee angle ""wants"" to open first to the point that my back is horizontal before the bar actually leaves the ground (just like in Fig 4-35 in Rippetoe's SS). With this kind of form, I was deadlifting 1.28X my bodyweight. If I force myself to maintain the same back angle through the pull, I could probably deadlift more like 1X my bodyweight, if that. Even if I deload to just 65 lbs, it stills feels really awkward that my knees are in the way of the bar as I start to pull.   I noticed that Rippetoe does allow for substantial differences in deadlift back angle due to individual morphometry – e.g., in Fig 4-31, the leftmost stick figure's back is almost horizontal. However, like I said, when I set up according to his instructions, my back angle is actually more like 45 degrees.   So my questions are: what kind of form, especially back angle, is correct for someone with my morphometry (long thighbones)? An additional complication is that my squat is embarrassingly weak, so is it a problem of weak quads? And what should I do about it?  EDIT: Indeed, my hips are rising to near-horizontal before the bar leaves the ground. "
1129,"I have extremely bad posture, what can I do?","I work 9 till 5 on my pc, then I go home, use my pc, then play a game or two.  My problem is I'm always sitting in my chair and my posture is starting to get really bad! People say ""just sit up straight and it will sort itself out"" and thats impossible! I'm a programmer, so I sit up straight and 30 seconds later I'm hunched over and don't even realise it!  What can I do? Certain stretches? Exercises?  I go swimming allot and I am in shape with a perfect BMI. "
1130,"Is it correct form to do concentration curls with your arm hanging freely? If not, why does it result in muscles bulging out more?","All this time I thought it was ok to do concentration curls with your arm hanging freely, instead of your elbow being pressed against your thigh. Now I didn't see any videos or blogs which said anything against this, but I was just wondering whether it's correct form or not. Furthermore, which would aid in getting stronger biceps faster?  Also, after doing it the way I've seen in videos (with my elbows resting against by thighs) I've noticed that my biceps don't bulge out as much compared to when I do the curls freely. Does this mean this method is slower at muscle development compared to my method?  "
1131,"Bicep curls, forearm down","What does doing bicep curls with forearms facing down achieve?  It seems that forearms facing up (standard way most people do them) exercise the ""outer"" bicep, while forearms facing down exercises an underlying layer of muscle? "
1132,What are reasonable numbers of lean muscle mass growth?,"Lot of advertisements of supplements and other fitness products tell that you can grow a lot of lean muscle mass in one month. I understand that it really depends on diet and exercises, but what are sane boundaries?  How much muscle mass can be developed - without the use of steroids - assuming different stages and intensities of training? "
1133,Are quick recovery supplements worth using?,I've seen a lot of drinks which seem to be protein shakes with extra carbs and probably some other bits in them specifcially designed for quick recovery after cardio.   Do these actually work or is it just as good to have a bowl of soup for example? What are the pro's and cons? 
1134,How does the weightlifting belt work?,"What does a weightlifting belt protects against? How exactly? I can't imagine why wearing it is better, although I have used them and, at least subjectively, I felt more safe and comfortable during the lifts. "
1135,Should one generally avoid machines in favor of free weights?,"From what I have been told, machines are not recommended for strength training, because they isolate muscles and thereby exclude the smaller stabilizing muscles from developing together with the major muscles.   I can see this point. Doing a barbell bench press feels entirely different from using a machine simulating the same movement.  The question, then, is: What justification is there for these machines at all? Should one generally prefer free weights over machines or are there plausible use cases where a machine is the better alternative? "
1136,Do I really need climbing shoes for indoor boulder climbing?,Indoor boulder climbing is pretty safe and climbing shoes are quite expansive. Are they really a necessity? Wouldn't my running shoes do the job just as well? Or even socks? Or ballet shoes..? 
1137,Why do I have to work my lower back?,"I recently just starting working out at a gym, and people told me that I should really work on my lower back and not to skip it etc.  I can understand that it is better to work out all my muscles in my body and not skip any, but what does working out lower back help me with?  Like, does it help my posture or weight lifting? "
1138,Core stability - how often and long?,"I've recently taken up trail running (as an ammateur) and discovered I lack in body balance on steep sections. My legs are also prone to injuries (minor ones, but annoying). I was told that core stability training could help me stabilize my legs and improve my balance (please correct me if I'm wrong). I haven't done much of any indoor training in the past because I found it really boring, but I think it's high time to have a go. Therefore I have a few questions.   How long should a core stability session be? Is it better to do a wider range of exercises or do multiple series of fewer exercises? How often should I ideally do the core stability sessions? I usually cycle or run 4-5 times a week if it matters. I'm also going to take up stretching sessions. How to join core and stretching with my standard cycling or running? Should I do a few sessions in a single day or reserve special days for core/stretching?   Any other piece of advice would be much appreciated. "
1139,Shaking when doing the exercise,"I usually go for a good half hour intensive spin session on the bike before starting any weights. However when doing leg extensions on a weight machine, I've noticed that although my legs don't feel the burn or strain, they are shaking like crazy when I'm lowering the weight.  Pushing it up is no problem but it looks like they're going crazy on the lowering stage of the rep.   My question is, is this a bad sign? I don't feel any sort of pain and I feel that I can add a good 15kg easily, but the shaking is actually creating a pretty big racket. Should I keep going or is the shaking mean that my legs are telling me to stop?  "
1140,Effects of not extending arm fully during bicep curl,"I've recently started working out at a gym, and I've been critiqued by a friend with whom I work out that I don't do the exercises as they are supposed to be done. I.e. when doing bicep curls I tend stop lowering the weight at approximately 120-130 degrees rathter than 150-160 degrees. The reason for this is that I don't have any force at all, even for really low weights, if I extend the arm further. My question is how this affects my strength gain? Do these additional 30 degrees make a difference? "
1141,Leg extension machine: Calculate calories burned and watt,"I'm making an app to put on my leg extension machine and to make it track my exercises (movements up and down) and store them in my sports tracker (Garmin Connect). I have all the data needed (every movement, kg/lbs weight I put on, my weight) but I don't know how to calculate what calories was burned? And how do I calculate watt (sports trackers like to store watt)? I would prefer to calculate it based on movements (1 movement = one up + one down) "
1142,Does exercising when only partially recovered benefit your performance in the long run?,"I wonder how training a particular muscle when not recovered fully affects long term performance gains. I know there is evidence that this does negatively affect short term performance, as well as increasing the risk of injury. Of course injury will set you back in the long term, but suppose you can avoid it. I know some athletes can train 30-40hours or more per week habitually (not just for a couple weeks in a row but longer periods), so I suppose it is possible it positively affects performance as long as you don't get injured?  Is there any scientific research that indicates how training a particular muscle when not recovered fully affects long term performance gains? "
1143,Taping the back for good posture,"Is it true that simple duct tape can be used to correct bad posture? If so can someone suggest how to do this and is there something better than duct tape (something water proof, for instance) available for this? "
1144,"What kind of training is the best, if you hava a competition the next day?","If you have some kind of sportive competition the next day, is it advisable to train? What intensity, and what kind of training is advisable?  In my case it's a judo competition. "
1145,"Is fat gain directly proportional to number of calories consumed for the same substance, or does it taper off.","My intuition tells me the following:  Let's assume on top of my regular diet, I eat a cupcake and as a result of eating that cupcake I put on 50g of fat. Now lets let's assume instead of eating one of those cupcakes I ate two instead.  To me it does not follow that will mean I will put on 100g of fat instead of 50g. It seems too simplistic and probably not how the body works, although my friends adamantly argue that it will mean exactly that.  Similarly I believe that I would gain more weight from eating a pizza, if I ate it one slice per day on top of my regular diet, rather than if I binged out at one time and consumed it all in one night. Again I can't really defend this idea, it's just intuition.  Is my intuition correct? If so, why, and what evidence can I show my friends to prove my case? "
1146,What kind of feet do I have?,"Running has evolved into a popular enough sport that it seems like you can get a special pair of shoes for almost every type of feet. My only problem is trying to identify exactly what type of feet I have.   From my own research I know most feet fit into one of three instep categories:    Pronators   Neutral  Supinators   And on either side of neutral you can be either: mild, moderate, or severe pronation/supination. But what else is there to know? Start googling foot types and you get a flood of classification types. This site claims to have a algorithm that identifies 24 different foot types.   Then there's your toe type:   Greek – Foot with the second toe being the longest. Egyptian – Foot with the big (first) toe being the longest. Square – Foot with even length toes.   Each of which can be further categorized as tapered or wide toe.  But what about everything else? Say you have wider feet, narrower heels, longer toes, heel spurs, small ankles, big toe gap?  Aside from visiting an orthopedic doctor is there a way for people to learn what kind of foot type they have?   "
1147,Exercises to prevent hip pain?,"I'm 33 and male. I've had pain in interior of my left hip for the past 5 years or so. I first noticed the pain when playing recreational ultimate frisbee. I have since stopped playing, but the pain comes back whenever I stress my legs. This happens now when I go hiking, running, or even moving furniture around the house.  I lean slightly to my left when I walk. This puts some additional stress on my hip which hurts.  Also, my hip clicks sometimes. I lie on my back and bring my left knee forward towards my chest. When I extend my leg back out, it pops/clicks. It never happens with my right leg.  The pain has been getting more frequent. I don't want to take Advil every time I exercise. Are there any strengthening exercises I can do which will help stabilize my hip and prevent pain? I've had great success with shoulder rotation exercises, which have stopped my left shoulder pain.... anything similar for hip, or is it a different type of problem?  UPDATE 2011.06.09 To answer some of the questions:  I had an MRI around 5 years when this first occurred. The orthopedist mentioned it was normal but my flexibility was poor in my left leg. He recommended physical therapy, but my insurance did not cover it at the time, so I could not do it.  In the past month since I posted the question, I've started going to a chiropractor. He mentioned that my left leg was 1/2 inch longer than right. In addition, he recommended left quad stretches and right hamstring stretches, as well as some other general stretches.  The chiropractor also performed some adjustments on my pelvic alignment, which he says will help my legs to equal length. He is also doing some massage.  After 4 chiro appointments, I have noticed some reduction in the pain. I have not started running yet, but I will see how it goes. "
1148,Do any particular exercise regimes consume excess cholesterol?,"I've searched for questions about cholesterol before, and haven't found a satisfactory answer; most seemed to be all speculation and little fact. I was wondering whether the generally accepted strict limits on dietary cholesterol should always apply to everyone, or whether people on intensive exercise regimes could safely consider a different amount of dietary cholesterol to be safe. The basic distinction which occurs to me is:   Cardio athletes, such as runners, cyclists, swimmers and so on; Hypertrophy athletes, such as bodybuilders and powerlifters   Do either of these exercise regimes either consume extra cholesterol, perhaps specifically in the recovery stage, destroy it such that it is no longer a problem, or emit some sort of enzymes or hormones that render it irrelevant?  As a layman I would expect hypertrophic exercises to consume extra cholesterol, since they promote the creation of extra tissue, of which cholesterol is an essential component. However, I realise that dietary cholesterol and cellular cholesterol are quite different, and consumption of one does not necessarily correlate with the presence of the other.  Is there any quality scientific literature on this topic, or does anybody have an educated view on the matter? "
1149,"When ""complimenting"" proteins, how do you determine the amount of complete protein?","To add a bit to the title:  If I eat 5 grams of protein from white rice, and 7 grams of protein from beans, have I eaten 12 grams of complete protein? Have I eaten 5 grams? Something else? "
1150,"Does burning calories by running depend only on distance, and not speed?","So it seems burning calories by jogging/running only depends on the distance covered, and not the speed. [website]Is this correct? Even if I ran the same distance in half the time I would only burn same amount of calories? It seems kinda overly simplistic.  "
1151,Auxiliary exercise to help my inverted rows to progress,"Apart from some light auxiliary RTC work, my workouts consist of bodyweight squats, inverted rows and push ups, the two latter in the form of lighter versions on the bar of a Smith machine.  I have been steadily making progress by increasing reps from 3x3 to 3x15, then lowering the Smith bar and starting again with 3x3... But I started today a new inverted row cycle by lowering one step the bar and trying 3x3 and failed. It is simply too hard. Going back by raising the bar a step and 3x15 makes not much sense, I think, since I am already able to do that (In fact that is what I did after seeing that the new level was impossible).  Should I add one auxiliary exercise? (Dumbbell bentover row / Barbell row / Cable seated row are some options I am thinking of, as well as something more vertical like the lat pulldown machine). Or should I simply insist and keep on trying until achieving 3x3 perfect-form, slow repetitions? - I would like to maintain the workout length to a minimum in order to stay away from overtraining and to focus my body resources on making progress in a few basic exercises.

1152,Cyclical Ketogenic Diet : type of fats + how many grams of carbs per day,"I am going to shift to a new diet : The Cyclical Ketogenic Diet.  I read and understood in general what is it about but i have two questions:   When they say High fat intake, is it a specific type of fat: saturated / trans / polyunsaturated / mononunsaturated , or any of these in general? The diet mentions days of low carbs and days of high carbs: how many grams of carbs per kg/pound of body weight is low carbs ? high carbs ?  "
1153,Training advice on long-distance running for a newbie,"I signed-up to Man vs. Mountain, it's a 20 mile race up (and down) Mount Snowdon. I'm looking for some advice with regards to training because it's a pretty daunting event and I've never done something like this before.  I'm currently running 10km 2/3 times a week in ~48 minutes, but 20 miles is around 30km which, at an average of 4minutes 37seconds a kilometre, just isn't sustainable.   They provide a 3-month training plan on the website but it's so generic that it'll be helpful, but it's obviously not tailored to me as an individual so it won't be as beneficial. Plus, the race is 7-months away so I'd like to start training now and feel more prepared!  So firstly I need to slow down, which feels a bit counter-intuitive because it's taken me about six months to get below 50 minutes - is this necessary?  Secondly (and the questions I have):   A) Should I train for a marathon to cover the 20 miles? B) Should I go cycling to build my quads? C) Should I start fell running to grow more accustomed to the hills? D) All of the above?   I'm wondering if some of these are more of a hindrance. I guess the ultimate goal is to maintain a decent up-hill pace for about 7 miles, to then complete the race in less than 5 hours? That's my goal anyway :) The fastest last year was 3 hours 30 minutes, so 5 hours seems reasonable!  Any help would be appreciated. "
1154,Should I care about Low Testosterone?,"My doctor wants to start some testosterone treatments on me because he says my levels are too low (they are 231 ng/dL and he said it should be between 348 to 1197). The question I have is, given that I don't have a girlfriend/wife, have never been on a date and am still a virgin (age 38 virgins, yes we exist), is there really any need for me to worry about my testosterone level?  It seems everywhere I look on google it is all about sex and sex drive. As someone that has no need for sex or a sex drive (see no wife nor girlfriend), is there anything else I would even care about? Do I really need to up my testosterone? "
1155,Is a vibrating belt not effective in reducing tummy fat?,"In my gym, there is a vibrating belt present. I haven't seen anyone using that so far in the past two months.

1156,Gym effect at evening,"What is best time for gym and exercise? Till now I was going to gym in morning. But now due to some timing change in my job , I will have to go gym in the evening.

1157,"Music ""slows down"" during heavy lift?","Sometimes when I'm squatting around maximal loads, I notice what could almost be described as a doppler shift in the music playing from my headphones for a brief moment.  The music (maybe my perception of time?) seems to ""slow down"" slightly, or everything is processed more slowly. This happens during instants of extreme exertion.  This is a strange question, I know, but has anyone else experienced this?  If so, what scientific explanation could there be for it?  Any potential harm? "
1158,How does muscle length and range of movement correlate?,"First, I'm free to admit that I don't know exactly where along a limb the muscle mass really is and also that I have a very simplistic view of ""short muscle"" - so if I'm conceptually wrong, please correct me or point me to some links.  When I was doing Muaythai, I think I had strong legs, specifically the muscle responsible for stretching the leg (quadriceps?). This muscle also seemd to be bulked on the upper end of my thigh, away from the knee. The range of movement of what I did with the leg was typically very close to a stretched position. Since I started going to a gym (and doing presses with the leg with a higher range of movement), I notice that my body builds muscle nearer to my knees ( or there's a new fat-deposit) - a good thing in my book, because I hope for more stable knees.   Is my observation plausible? Can this be generalized for the training effect of movements with different ROMs? "
1159,At what speed should I run?,"I'm wondering how one should control the speed of running. Currently my running speed for a 'long' run goes like this:  1st-3rd minute: Starting an 9km/h going down to about 8km/h. I actually try to run slower, but find it difficult and awkward.  -40th minute: From a little over 8km/h slowly decreasing to 7km/h.  -45th minute: Slightly increased speed (7.5 to almost 8km/h) due to 'end of run motivation'  Heart rate is at about 140bpm after 5minutes and increases slowly to about 150bpm after 40minutes, going to 155-160 in the last 5 minutes.  Question: Should I change anything on the speed profile in order to be able to run for longer time at about the same average speed or a little faster. This is not about the training effect of the pace/intensity, but about the ability to maintain the average speed for longer / increase the average speed for a given distance. Basically as if the run would be a competition.  Especially:   I find it a little strange that I ran so fast in the beginning, although I actively try to go slow. Is this ok, or should I try harder to go slow? Should I go slower after the first 5 minutes in order to keep my speed until the end?   Background: I picked up running 5 weeks ago and my longest run was (this morning) 6km in 45min as described above. My medium scope goal is to run 8km in an hour. My maximum heart rate is 180bpm. "
1160,Belly is becoming larger even though I am on diet,"I've been on a diet since last month. I have decreased my food intake, and noticably my weight has lost a couple of pounds(5 lbs), my arms,legs have become more slender but I have been curious that my belly size seems to be the same or is becoming larger. I haven't measured it yet so I do not have a clue as to why it is like that. Recently I have been taking on whey protein shakes and have gone to the gym at least 3 times last week. I am wondering if this is the effect of me drinking protein shakes?  Also I sit for an almost unbelievable 9- 10 hours a day(work and driving home). I try to use the stairs whenever I go to the restroom, and when I go out for lunch I try to walk around 1 - 2 blocks away from the office but I am quite worried that I am still feeling ""heavy"".  What should I do to decrease my belly size? Apparently some muscles have already been showing my arms and I am quite happy with them, it's just that my belly has become a lot bigger. I've stopped drinking beer since last month, plus I rarely drink beer before(1-2 bottles every month). I am however used to eat salty foods, mostly peanuts. I try my best to drink water but is it ok to go past 3 litres a day?   I am 23 years old, 145 lbs, and 5'6 in height. I do full body workouts (1 day for chest, 1 day for back, 1 day for shoulders, on all three days with gym I also do abs and legs) "
1161,Increasing my cardio,I'm trying to lose weight and I want to know the best ways to increase my cardio? I try to push my self to at least run or use the bicycle for 30 or 40 min but if I'm on the treadmill I can sprint maybe like 3 times and hold it for 3 min and the rest of the time I end up mostly walking (or speed walking).  With the bicycle it can do a little better but not much?  
1162,"Troubleshooting ""Body By Science"" workout","I've been doing a workout inspired by Body By Science for the last 5 weeks. I can't do the whole book justice in a quick post, but in a nutshell it recommends doing a single set of 3-5 exercises slowly, with high intensity, and to failure once per week. The purpose of the exercise is to exhaust all four types of muscle fibers simultaneously and drain their glucogen reservoirs. Supposedly this sets off different cascading effects within the body for strength gain, general endurance (including ""cardio"") and fat loss. The workouts are spaced a week apart because supposedly it takes that time to fully recover and more frequent workouts are counterproductive. The explanations in the book are referenced and if there's any dubious science, I missed it.  I've found that it seems to have maintained my strength, weight, body fat %, etc. with only the short weekly workout, but I am stagnant. I'm not getting any stronger (as measured by time-under-load) or any lighter (as measured by drop in scale weight or body fat %). I have not changed any other aspect of my lifestyle; sleep, diet, supplements, stress level have all been constant.  I would like some help diagnosing what the problem is:   Flaw in the book's premise or research? Flaw in my workout (will describe below)? Flaw in my progress measurements? (Perhaps my ""intensity"" is increasing so I tire myself out faster, making time-under-load a poor indicator of progress)   My workout details:   Once per week, one set per exercise (5 total) 5 freeweight exercises, in order: Bench Press, Squat, Upright Barbell Row, Standing Barbell Shoulder Press, Deadlift I use a weight for each that allows approximately 1 minute of time-under-load before I fail, doing sets at approx. a 5 sec. cadence I track progress by measuring time-under-load (start to failure) with a stopwatch; I do not count reps Enough rest between exercises to move the bar/weights and set up the next exercise. I'll wait a bit long if I'm breathing hard (my heart rate stays elevated throughout, I'm just resting to get my breath back)   I think I'm following the spirit of the book's recommendations, but for full disclosure here are the areas I can think of in which I deviate (the book didn't seem to indicate that these would be significant problems):   I'm using free weights instead of the recommended Nautilus machines (primarily because I use my home gym and that's what I have). I use a power rack, so I can safely bench &amp; squat to true failure. I use a 5 sec. cadence instead of the 10 sec. recommended by the book, mostly because I can't go any slower than 5 without feeling like I'm stopping.   Update: I've selected an answer, which I think addresses my issue well, but I'd like to add a couple additional items of note that I've tried (neither seemed to affect my performance) in case anyone else follows in my footsteps:   According to the follow-on BBS Q&amp;A book (and one or two of the answers below), 7 days may not be enough recovery time especially for bigger guys. I've tried increasing that to 10-11 days. Started up a regimen of creatine and L-glutamine to help improve recovery.  "
1163,Simple Diet Advice?,"I am off work for 2 weeks soon. I am not doing much (saving money really!) so I would like to use this time to focus on the gym a bit more.  I have been doing Stronglifts with added cardio 3 times a week for 9 weeks now (Been lifting for a year prior to the program change), but I am sitting at 15.7% bf. I would like to lower this (ideal goal 12-13).  I want to use these two weeks to move closer to my goal (while hopefuly keeping strength!)  I am looking for a simple diet I can test out over these two weeks that combined with my workouts will hopefully reduce my bf% at the end. (Doesn't have to be that soon but I would like that).  I had originally thought about turkey, sweet potato, fish but I don't know how many times a day to eat?, what food will help towards my goals?, how much should I eat? etc etc.  Can anyone offer some advice? (I am open to mixing up my workouts to help too if anyone has advice that would help).  (Weight 73kg, bf 15.7%, height 171cm, age 21) "
1164,Does aerobic exercise training change resting metabolism?,"My question is basically whether aerobic exercise training makes one more effective at utilizing a greater proportion of FFAs (free fatty acids) as opposed to glucose under resting conditions. So this excludes any increases in resting metabolic rate.   For example, if you take a sedentary individual and train that person with aerobic exercise for 6 weeks, will that individual be any quicker to lipolysis in response to normal sedentary activities (e.g. walking) after being aerobically trained? If we assumed the resting metabolic rate didn't change, should he or she rely on any greater percentage of FFAs?  "
1165,Calories needed to gain weight?,"I spoke with a trainer a while back and after telling him my current weight and desired weight he suggested that I eat 3500 calories per day.  I am 6'5 and at the time I was about 200lbs and I reached my goal of 220lbs.  If I want to continue to gain weight (say I want to hit 240), do I need to increate my caloric intake or will I continue to gain wait by eating 3500 calories a day?  Was the 3500 calories a day designed to help me gain weight indefinitely, or just hit 220? "
1166,Is my current nutrition enough to support my body building goals?,"I am new to to bodybuilding. Though I have worked out previously for more than 6 months on and off, I haven't really followed a proper schedule or had the right nutrition. My goal is to have lean muscle while being decently bulked up. I do not want to look huge, but my goal would be to look ripped. My height is 177cm and I weigh 160 pounds and I am 28 years old.   I find this daily requirement for a person in terms of carbs/protein/fat very confusing because there is diverse information about it on the internet and it is hard to figure out for a beginner which one exactly to follow.   I work out for 1 hour a day, 4 days a week. I spend a 5th day of the week on cardio. My current daily food intake includes   Breakfast: 1 cup oats/cornflakes with 250 ml milk, 2 medium bananas, 5 eggs(2 whole, 3 whites) Morning Snack: 2 slices watermelon, 50gm of peanuts Lunch: 8oz chicken(part of whole chicken), 150gm of mixed veggies(broccolli, beets, carrot, beans, peas), 4 slices brown bread Evening Snack: 2 oranges small, 1 teaspoon peanut butter Dinner: 8oz Chicken(part of whole chicken), 1 cup brown rice, 150gm of mixed veggies(broccolli, beets, carrot, beans, peas), 2 egg whites Before Bed: 250ml milk, few nuts   Is this enough nutrition? Do I need to modify my intake? Any insights will be appreciated. Thanks in advance. "
1167,Maintaining muscle whilst not working out (injured),"I'm currently working on adding muscle and have been pretty successful over the last 6 weeks (adding well over a stone in weight, albeit a little fat as well as muscle).   Last week I injured my shoulder. I experience a minor pain in the rear of my shoulder blade when moving my arm and when bending down to reach something.   Whilst I am injured and obviously not lifting weights, I don't want my body to start shedding the muscle that I've worked so hard to attain. Because I have such a high metabolism, is this likely to happen? If so, what can I do to stop my body from shedding muscle?  So far I have stuck to my diet which I changed following the advice of this website (high protein meals around 200 calories every 2-3 hours). I have also added in an extra protein shake a day to make up some more healthier calories along with plenty of fish. "
1168,I can't do enough chin ups,"About 10 months back I got a pull up bar set up at home.It was very thick.I had problems gripping it.I couldn't do a single chin up on it.However after several days of trying,I was able to do a chin up.Then I kept on practicing chin ups and after about 2 to 3 months or more(I am not sure),I could do about 9 chin ups at a time.But after that I lost interest in it and didn't practice it for about 6 to 7 months.A few days back I tried doing chin ups.I managed to do 6 and every next day the number is decreasing.Today I was just able to do 3.5.How can I again increase that number? For how much time should i practice? Should I practice everyday?I can understand that i can't do as many chin ups as before due to lack of practice but why is the number decreasing every next day?Please guide me.BTW my age is 16 if that matters.

1169,"Which side to begin with, doing alternating exercises?","When doing alternating dumbbell exercises where you only work one side at a time, holding only one dumbbell, eg Dumbbell Rows or Kroc Rows, which side should I start with? I've taken a look at some videos and most people start with their right side. This confuses me. Most people are right handed and hence I assume that the right side is their stronger side.   I wonder if it makes sense to begin with the weaker side so that I am not too exhausted when switching to the other side. So should I start with the weaker or stronger side? "
1170,Hay diet's effectiveness,Does the Hay diet (essentially not mixing protein based food with carbohydrate based foods in the same meal) actually produce good results? Are such restrictions unhealthy or excessive? 
1171,Does running in Vibrams (or some other minimalist shoes) make you run faster?,"I have been running for about 20 years, mostly 10-21 km over the past few years. This past year I've transitioned into running in Vibrams - in the simplest model I found - and about two month ago I stopped running in ""regular"" shoes altogether.  typically jog for the first few km, and then speed up for the last 5.5 km of my run, which is done on a flat, paved bike path/pedestrian walkway. I have more than a hundred times for this particular section, and since I started running it in the Vibrams, my average time has dropped dramatically. I'd say that for the past year, I've been doing it in 26-30 minutes, and in the past month from 25-27. Furthermore, in the past my times were all over the place- on a bad day I'd end up jogging it (hence 30 minutes) and on a good day it could be 26. In the Vibrams it feels like I can't really slack off and jog slowly, even on days I feel lackluster.  Does this make sense? Do minimalist running shoes force you into better form and improve your times? "
1172,What do I do when goblet squat weight isnt enough?,"I work out at a gym that doesn't have a squat rack (they have a Smith machine, but I don't use it). I have been doing goblet squats for the last few weeks. I like them. I feel like my form is a lot better than when I do barbell back squats. The downside is that the gyms dumb bells only go up to 85 pounds. I tore my groin a year ago and hadn't worked out for 6 months while I was trying to let it heal (it still hurts after PT but im desperate to work out again and squats don't bother it that much). After all of that time off and wanting to be cautious with my groin, 85 pounds is fine for now. I am, however, outgrowing it pretty quickly and soon I will need to be able to add more weight.  With dumbbell side squats I can do more weight, but it hurts my hands and my grip isn't all that great. They also tend to bang my legs. I feel like its still a great workout, but my form is off and I feel like I lean forward too much. I can do them, but its not ideal.  I have tried zercher squats, but along with front barbell squats, I feel like my arms get tired long before my legs do. I can add more weight than I have available for goblet squats but I am still limited by my arms.  Is there some form of squat that doesn't rely too heavily on your arm strength but also doesn't require a squat rack? I know that's probably asking too much, but even if I have to look in to some home equipment I may be willing to. Maybe there is a way I can do a zercher or other front squat without as much pain? I can do leg press and other machines, but its obviously not the same as a squat.  Thanks! "
1173,"During muscle loss, are muscle fibers destroyed or do they just shrink?","I read somewhere that muscle fibers stay around when you lose muscle but that they only shrink (hence why people can more quickly re-add muscle after a long break than when they first put it on).   Is this true, or during muscle loss, are muscle fibers consumed by the body? If they do shrink, is there a time period for which they stay around? For instance, Christian Bale lost a dramatic amount of weight for his role in The Mechanic after he had gained a lot of muscle for Batman. Had he stayed at his weight in the Mechanic, is there some point at which he would have to rebuild all new muscle from scratch?   Update:  From what I could find, this link seems to indicate that fiber count stays the same, at least when atrophy is from lack of use (which is mainly what I was curious about) but I still wonder about the two questions above if anyone has any more details.  "
1174,How to get rid of nerve pinch in shoulder?,"I've had a nerve pinch in my right shoulder for god knows how long.  I'm unable to go through the full motion of wide grip pull ups or wide grip cable pulldowns with any moderate weights.  Anyone have any ideas how to resolve this.  I've tried to some stretching of the shoulders and it seems to help, a bit.  Is stretching the way to go and will just take time to resolve?  Should I just go see a doctor?    This has always been a issue.  "
1175,Is maintaining really so bad?,"In a process of one question begetting another, Meade Rubenstein made a comment about something I stated in my original question.  It seems like an interesting enough question on its own, so here we are.  The comment was:     Never Maintain, always increase intensity or change workout to keep your body from getting use to the workout, which reduces it's effectiveness.   If my goal for my strength training is more supplemental to my other fitness goals, and I am happy with the strength I've achieved, is there really any reason to keep pushing harder?  For example, my initial goals support general health.  An added bonus would be the ability to get back into martial arts which I've neglected for a couple years due to various health problems exacerbated by my weight at the time.  In martial arts, absolute strength (i.e. what you can lift) doesn't really mean much.  Your technique and your ability to flow from one movement to another is more important.  In fact, your power is directly linked to your technique.  That's what makes a small man with polio in one leg able to crush a coconut in mid air, while Arnold Schwarzenegger might have a hard time doing the same.  So instead of poling for your opinions on whether you agree or disagree with Meade's statement, I'll ask my usual mutipart question (hopefully I'll understand more):   Are there any negative consequences to keeping the weight constant while you perform your workout? (assumption is that you are already where you want to be) If constant growth is important, how do you keep from becoming the overly muscular guy so you can still fit in your clothes?  I worked hard to get down to the size I am, and replacing my wardrobe is expensive.  I'd rather not go back up. How do you manage the demands of strength training when you only want it as a supplement to your other fitness activities? (cardio/running, martial arts, etc.)  "
1176,Missing mounting brackets for doorway pull bar. Alternatives?,"I recently got a pull up bar from a friend, but he was missing the mounting brackets/cups to put it up in the doorway. Since I can't find the mounting brackets sold separately anywhere on the internet, I'm thinking of heading to the hardware store to find an alternative.  The pull up bar is similar to this: [website]Plumbing flanges are unlikely to work because the molding on our doorways protrudes (inwards) and is exactly the same size as the diameter of the bar, so there is no space for the outer ring (though, I could only screw it in in 2 places — the top and the bottom)  I am considering trying a PVC cap, with holes drilled into the bottom, though I have concerns about it's ability to hold up my weight.  Any other ideas or suggestions? Do you know where I can get pull up bar mounting brackets? Do you think a PVC cap will hold? "
1177,Feet turned out while running,"This is related to this question: Is it bad that my feet turn outward when I run?  I have the exact experience, but my circumstances are a little different as I believe I have a physical condition that forces me to run this way.  I don't run much at the moment, due to a debilitating knee pain that running triggers. Recently, I was persuaded to undergo an assessment by a specialist running school, who videoed me and pointed out a few things wrong with my technique that were likely responsible for my discomfort. In particular the fact my feet turn out and I cross-over - this they blamed for the knee pains.  I took some lessons, and I've mostly fixed the cross-over. However, I cannot seem to fix the turnout without causing pain. If I do what they tell me, then the outer edge of my foot is taking nearly all the load and in an extended session, results in ankle and shin pains. I've tried explaining to them, but they seem to be used to dealing with people for whom the turnout is easily correctable - i.e. there are no physical reasons for it.  Let me explain more here - if I sit on the floor with my knees aligned vertically, my feet are turned out around 15 degrees. My feet are also turned with respect to the vertical plane by the same amount, i.e. if I sit in the same position against a wall, then I can place the outside edges against the wall, but the balls of my feet are about a finger width's distance from the wall.  What this means is that when I walk, if I turn my feet to that they point straight ahead, I end up walking almost completely on the outside edges of my feet.  The question is what should I be doing? Is my problem correctable - i.e. If I keep trying to be straighter, eventually everything will start working better or should I aim to land with my natural turn out position?  I'm not sure anymore who I should be talking to about this - the running school appear unfamiliar with how to deal with my condition. The previous ""specialist"" seemed to know very little about running and with hind-sight was useless to me.   Having taken advice from many different people over the past few years, what I'm looking for here is info from people who are familiar with my condition, and have experience with trying to resolve it. If you don't have this experience, please don't add your two-pennyworth for the hell of it. "
1178,Correct form of cuban rotation with a single dumbbell,"What is the correct way to perform cuban rotation with a single dumbbell?  I am experimenting with cuban rotation as an assistance exercise for olympic lifting and gymnastic arm balances. My current exercise plan is 3x per week olympic lifting plus handstand skill work every other day (not really structured) plus some light yoga in the mornings. I have no shoulder injuries or mobility problems, I want to use this exercise primarily to increase strength.  I have seen cuban rotations performed in a number of ways:   Standing, with barbell: the bar goes from the stomach to behind the head in 180 degree angle. With dummbell, elbow unsupported: the same as above, with either 1 or 2 dumbbells, standing or sitting, 180 degrees motion With dumbbell, elbow supported: with 1 dumbbell, the elbow supported on the knee, but only 90 degrees of rotation (lowering the dumbbell from vertical to horizontal, and back)   What are the advantages/disadvantages of each version? Currently I prefer the single dumbbell version, because even an unloaded barbell seems too heavy for this exercise, and I only have a single dumbbell at home.  With a single dumbbell, should I have my elbows supported or not? Should the range of motion be 90 degrees or 180?  The supported version with a ROM of more than 90 degrees feels awkward and sometimes very slightly painful in my shoulder. Should I reduce the weight and try to perform in full range of motion, or is 90 degrees ok in the long term? "
1179,What's this move called in gymnastics?,"This is what I've seen as stunts in movies. I have no real visual examples but I might be able to explain in words?   It's when you run forward then start to flip. First both hands on the floor, then continue the flip, both feet on the floor, continue the flip, both hands on the floor, etc. Hands on floor, feet on floor, hands on floor, feet on floor, and you continue to flip. Forward or backwards. It works best if executed fast I guess. Leeloo Minai Lekatariba-Lamina-Tchai Ekbat De Sebat for example was doing a variation of that move in ""The 5th Element""   So what's the move called? Is there a list where I could browse through gymnastic moves?  Edit: Thanks to Sean I found what I was looking for: YouTube-Video "
1180,Weight loss stopped (even gaining a bit weight),"I've started excercising and following diet to lose weight this January. I weigh 110 kilogramms now, and I was somewhere around 125 before. I've lost the first 10 kgs in one month, now nearly nothing, it totally stopped. I'm usually eating 60-80g of carbohydrates and 140g protein, which comes from chicken, fish, vegetables, and fruits. I take absolutely no sugar, and no wheat. I excercise 2-3 times a week, one hour of jumpy-runny kind of cardio (no more time for that).  I'm a little confused about a lot of things:   some articles say that I should take more carbs because my body is starving, but they are also calculating with more excercise, if I'd stick with 100-140 gramms, I'd literally eat the same meals like before I started they also mention that I need at least one gramm of protein per 1kg of body weight, but some say that per lean body mass, which is about 60 gramms, considering that ~50% of my body is fat (if the measuring device is correct) nearly every source states that 5-6 meals a day is the best for losing weight, but I'm not sure that then the glycogen breakdown even starts? I've been thinking about following the ketogenic diet as well, but I'm not sure if the amount of fat it advises is good for me? I mean if I don't really count calories, only carbs, it's all right? if not, how much calories should I take, and how is that broken down into carbs, protein, and fat?   Thank you really-really much in advance! "
1181,Gaining strength at constant body weight vs bulking up followed by losing weight,"Calorie intake restriction while trying to gain strength seems not to be easy, and I have experienced with my own eyes an improvement from one workout to another, by simply eating more than usual in the three days rest in between.  I guess it is time to start tracking down macronutrients and calories. I would like to avoid that, and I am thinking about a complementary approach: not paying much attention to the scale (well, at least within some reasonable limits) for some time until achieving some decent results in my strength training, and then entering a phase in which I might try to loose weight while doing the exact amount of work each workout with the hope of forcing the body not to loose muscle during that phase.  I think that might have something to do with the words ""bulking phase"" and ""cutting phase"" that I have read here and there, but I am completely ignorant and the net is full of bad advise motivated by commercial interests.  Can anybody explain a bit on the matter before I do something unhealthy?. To phrase it more specifically: I would like to know if those ""bulking"" and ""cutting"" bodybuilding phases are essentially what I am pondering to do, and I would like general guidelines on how to do it, why should I (or should not) do it, perhaps some online references. What are the advantages of both approaches? (trying to gain strength and muscle at constant body weight vs bulking and then cutting). "

1183,How bad of a vice is gum chewing?,"I'm currently on a paleo diet which means I'm supposed to cut out sugar, however, I still chew sugarfree gum after lunch usually (Maybe 2 or 3 pieces a day). My question is this: how detrimental is this to my diet? The nutrition facts say that each stick only has 5 calories, but does chewing gum right after a meal have some other adverse effect on the way my body processes the food? "
1184,How much do I need to sleep?,"I'm a 16 years old guy and I'm not getting enough time to complete my daily jobs. So, I decided to cut my sleep but after reading a few articles it seem not to be a good option.  I used to sleep 8 hrs approx..  Now I want to cut it to 6 hrs, after trying it for one day, I realised that I  was not feeling good that day and I was feeling a slight weakness.  Is it normal  if I change mmy schedule? How much do I need to sleep? Please  suggest the least time possible with no side - effects. "
1185,"You've heard it said, ""Lift with your knees, not your back."" What in the world is a deadlift, then?","I've done a lot research on proper form and near as I can tell the deadlift is a back lift. Doesn't this go completely against conventional wisdom?  And when I'm out in the world, how should I be lifting furniture and bags of mulch? Squatting or deadlifting? "
1186,What does academic research say about the relationship between squats and hGH/Testoterone?,"I hear a lot of advocacy of squats as a method for producing testosterone and human growth hormone as part of exercise-induced muscle hypertrophy.   I cannot, however, find any academic research on this question outside of anecdotal evidence.  Is there any research to suggest that squats are the most effective exercise at producing hGH and testosterone?  What other exercises do this?  **Note, I am not skeptical of the claim that the total work done during a particular exercise is related to hGH output-- I am skeptical of the claim that squats are significantly MORE effective than other exercises at inducing higher postexercise hGH blood levels.  I am wondering if there is evidence explicating the degree to which certain compound exercises contribute to blood-serum hGH levels.   "
1187,Calories to grams,"I am trying to work out how much fat, carbs, and protein I should be consuming daily based on my BMR which is around 2025 calories.  Apparently you're supposed to have 500 calories less than your BMR to lose around 1lbs a week.  Anyway, I have done the following calculations and wanted to know if I have worked it out correctly:  type        percentages     calories    grams per calorie   grams  fat          30              457.50     9                    50.83 protein      15              228.75     4                    57.19 carbs        55              838.75     4                   209.69  calories    100             1525.00   Have I worked this out correctly?  Does this mean I should be having around 317g of food a day? "
1188,Does SLOW reps have the similar effect as high resistance,"If I do my reps slower, will it have a similar effect to increasing resistance?  With respect to building muscles or improving max strength for example?  Assume I go to failure / same level of fatigue in both cases.  7 DEC  Example: In my current pull exercise, with the highest resistance, I can do 20 reps.   I can continue to increase reps, but over time I want to increase resistance (with less reps).  So I am thinking I could do it slower, with some of the same effects as high resistance.  If it is ""effective"" is not really the question, more if it works similar to high resistance vs high rep.  (Personal directions in profile) "
1189,Medium-Chain Triglycerides for weight loss?,"I have recently heard of several use cases of Medium-Chain Triglycerides for somewhat rapid weight loss.  Seeing this seemingly corroborated anecdote got me started down this thought process.  I then discovered an actual protocol on BulletProofExec.com that seems to take the cake.  My wife and I have experimented so far with MCT consumption and we've already verified that it does kick your body into ketosis. She had some (fascinating) serious allergic reactions in her arms where she has received allergy shots for the past couple years in the surrounding tissue / fatty stores there.  This should not have happened and the doctors had no explanation as to why it occurred, but we realized afterwards that she had just taken her first does of MCTs an hour before this kicked her butt.  Does anyone have experience with this kind of protocol good or bad?  And does anyone have any ideas of what kind of physical activity / exercise during this kind of protocol would be appropriate? "
1190,"Duration of running for weight loss, and diet control","I am not very good at running, but I need to get some weight loss for my little fat belly. I would like to go running because I don't know swimming and I got a fear for deep water(2m or more), shame on me.  I want to know how many time do I need to run in a week and how long I need to run? I welcome an answer in terms of how much time or how far to run.  And, how should I control my diet? I don't know how much calory do my meals have. "
1191,Purpose and Effectiveness of Pre Workout Supplements,While shopping at my local vitamin shop I noticed they had pre workout supplements available. I took a quick look at them and they seemed to be designed to give you energy. All of them seemed to contain caffeine.   Are these supplements effective in improving a workout? Are they really any better then taking caffeine pills? Or any other source of caffeine? Do they perform any other function that I may not be aware of?  
1192,"How come I don't built a great deal of strength quickly, yet I see countless other lifters who do?","I have outlined potential reasons as to why some get stronger faster and easier:  1.Testosterone - while it's not 100% correlated with strength, more promotes more muscle mass, which increases potential for strength. Perhaps I have low testosterone?  2.Genetics - while they are not a 100% make or break, some people have very poor genetics when it comes to proper CNS use, muscle size, efficiency, etc. I have poor balance as well, and lose breath running barely 50 feet, being at a healthy weight. Maybe I have bad genes for powerlifting/fitness, and should just be a lazy, weak nerd?  3.Biomechanics - while they again do not fully dictate things, and genetics also can cover this, some people have larger limbs, digits, hands, thickness, skeletal frame, leverage, muscle placement, recovery speeds faster, etc. Maybe I have poor recovery speed, and bad biomechanics as well?  4.Stress - I have constant anxiety and sleep poorly, and suffer from stress a lot due to social anxiety. Maybe that explains why I so poorly can improve?  So my question is, and being truthfully, aside from taking a buttload of roids, and working out, are some people just destined to fail easily at weight training?  Paradox notes: I notice that after one week off or so I get dramatically weaker, but if I workout more than once a week I fatigue and overwork, and suffer from pain. I have worked out for years, but fatigue after several reps, and suffer pain for days if I do too many reps. My focus is only strength, so I do tend to stay with low reps, but I never get stronger. I even tried 5x5, but nothing.  Perhaps I've learned something in these years? Should I just throw in the towel and agree that aside from roids, I am a low-T, poor genetic mold of a person who works out years properly, with proper diet, and still can't compare to the average man, and admit that weight lifting is not for me?   Or is there an alternative? And do not say working hard because I have done that all my life, used proper technique, proper diet, and have not made any gains in years. "
1193,Should I drink muscle gainer on days when I'm not working out?,"The thing is I have this trendy Mutant Muscle Gainer that advises me to take 4 cups of it in a day when I workout - 2 cups before the workout and 2 cups after. This goes pretty well to me. But the thing is, however, that I feel a little bit ashamed when I don't drink it during the days I'm not exercising - I'm drinking it to gain weight mass, but I'm not drinking it regularly as I'm only going to the gym 3 days a week.   Should I be bothered at all? Or should I drink this thing each and every day? "

1196,Are pullups still a good way to build muscle before you're able to do many of them?,"I can only do about 3 full pullups (from completely extended to head above bar).  I hear that pullups are a great way to build muscle, but I wonder if this could really be true if you can't do very many yet.  Are pullups still a great workout if you can only do a couple at a time?  Should I build my arms in other ways, like benching and pushups, then start working out with pullups when I am strong enough to do more at once? "
1197,Should I run along?,"I was advice to start c25k workout schedule in this post, but as I run, I am worry about my knees. Today is my 4th workout since the start of c25k.  My knees have been strange since some years ago, even I didn't commit to running several times a week like now. The problem is when I walk, my knees feel very strange. I am no expert to biology, I can only describe it like this: The part where the knees connect to my lower legs feel like empty or lacking something in between.  The syndrome will not appear if I stand still or sit. When I run or walk faster so that the pressure increase, the feeling appears.  Oh, should I see the doctor again? Should I stop running, or running will heal this problem?  By the way, I don't workout in my life till now. In my university life, I spent 60 minutes walking to and from my school, would it sounds like the connective tissue wear out?  Here is the position I mention:  "
1198,Practical Programming + Couch to 5K - Diet,"I'm looking at starting a regimen combining the Practical Programming strength training routine (a derivative of the Starting Strength program) with the Couch to 5K running plan, in order to improve both strength and cardio.

What does my nutritional breakdown need to be? Any other advice?  "
1199,Why do I keep regaining weight and feel lethargic on my diet?,"I am posting a composite profile of a chronic dieter who doesn't seem to get anywhere from both my own experience and others.     I've read about BMR, calories, and I get it.  Fewer calories in, more calories burned.  Since my BMR is about 2400 calories, I should be able to lose close to two pounds a week if I cut down to 1600 calories.  And if I work out I should be able to lose even faster.      So I did that ""Mediterranean"" diet where you eat like people in the Mediterranean do.  You've never seen a fat person there, right?  I'm eating 1600 calories a day and I'm just evil to be around.  I have no energy, I can barely form a coherent thought, and I get paid to use my brain.  This just isn't working.      It's been three months since I did the Mediterranean diet and I'm heavier now than I was then.  What gives?  I'm eating the 2400 calories a day to maintain, but I'm steadily getting heavier.   This seems to be the plight of many calorie counters out there.  A friend of mine was actually told by her doctor that she was exercising too much and eating too little.  The ""Mediterranean"" diet was my own experience.  There's got to be some magic formula to this right? "
1200,How to distinguish acetone and ammonia odor after running?,I heard that burning fat leads to acetone odor while burning muscles leads to ammonia smell.  Is this true? How can I distinguish both smells as they are very similar? 
1201,Is it better to do Barbell Squats with a lower weight or Smith Machine higher weight?,"I've been doing the Stronglifts 5x5 program as you guys sugested and it's been amazing. I can really say that I feel great. Being a complete newbie as I started I had no idea there's a difference between a Smith Machine and a Power Rack so I've been doing all my squat workouts on that machine and managed to reach 65kgs.  After more Research I can see that most of you agree Barbell Squats are much more usefull than Smith Machines but that would mean I have to set the Barbell on my shoulder by myself and I don't think I can lift more than 40/50Kg over my head and onto my shoulders.  Now onto my question, should I carry on with the Smith Machine squats or should I do my best weight with a Barbell squat?  Are there any easier ways to get the weight onto my shoulders than the awkward over the head pull?  PS: No strength Training Partner no Power Rack as of yet(will do my best to change the gym) "

After 3 Kg reduction also (around 5%) she is not getting her periods (menstrual cycle) naturally and so loosing weight very slowly. I got the information that reduce the intake of dairy products.Actually milk (skim milk) is low glycemic, the protein that enhances the insulin production.  And in PCOS we have to give low glycemic foods and also not to increase insulin production. I am also giving a supplement containing soluble fibre to take care of increased insulin production due to PCOS.  So shall I reduce or stop giving milk &amp; milk products? And which are other foods which I should stop giving or decrease the quantity? "

Besides the difference of ""exercising"", what is the difference between having a high heart rate from doing a cardio workout versus having a high heart rate from emotions?    Confrontation, Fear, Nervousness ... These emotions elicit a response from the body that increases heart rate often for an extended period of time.   Could being pissed off and storming around the room for a half hour be a workout equivalent of walking around the block?   "
1206,What can I eat while walking?,I usually go out in the evening for walking to get some physical workout done as I have a sedentary lifestyle (I sit a lot in workplace as I am a computer programmer). I walk for nearly 30-40 mins or sometimes for almost 1 hr and I go for walking at around 7 pm. While walking I feel the urge to eat and drink something. Is it good to eat or drink while walking? If yes then what is the best food or fruits or supplements that I can carry along with me while walking? 
1207,Training: quality vs quantity,"Quite some time ago I trained has a shot put athlete, only at a regional level. I trained hard but only about 1h30 per day, 3 to 4 day per week. I never made great marks.  Later I had to abandon the sport and start working on a summer job at a big supermarket, filling shelves. I didn't had to make big efforts, besides piking the ocasional fridge or washing machine, I simply had to keep standing for 8 hours a day. Sometimes I had to make double shift, but very rarely.  Eventually I left the job and my trainer asked me if I could do one last competition and, to my surprise, I've made my best mark ever, by far.  To this day I have no idea what happened. Could it be because my muscles got rested and preformed better? Or could it be that doing physical effort  for longer periods of time, even if non specific and with weaker intensity, is more efficient? "
1208,How can I improve my diet and exercise routine?,"I'm a student who has struggled with my weight since I went off to college, particularly during my sophomore year. I'm a 5'11 male, and I would guess my starting weight as I entered college was around 175-180 lbs.   After I started working during my sophomore year I started eating out a lot more due to a lack of time to cook and prepare meals (and extra money in my pocket). Before I knew it hit me I had put on almost 30 lbs and was sitting at 206.   This was definitely a depressing thing for me. I was very active in high-school and in-shape. I never had to worry about what I ate because of playing sports and just being generally active.  After I saw 206 on the scale I immediately made a change in my diet and started working out again. I went from 206 to 190 in about 3 months. However, since then (almost 8 months ago) I have hit a plateau and struggled to lose anymore. Now a-days I hover more around 193-195.  I'm looking for advice on what I can change in my eating habits and workout routine to keep dropping the weight. I'd like to lose another 10 at least.  The changes I've made in my diet are this:   Extreme cut back on soda. I used to drink a mountain dew every morning for the caffeine, and maybe another soda around lunch time. I stopped buying soda to keep at home and will only drink it at a sit-down restaurant. I would say on average I consume about 1 soda a week now, maybe less (Coke Zero). No late night carbs. I was/still am a late night snacker. I used to eat a bagel before bed every night. Looking back I think it's hilarious how stupid this was, so I stopped doing that. Started going to the gym again. I would say 2-3 times a week after class. More recently (within the last month), I've been going 4-5 times a week.   My gym routine looks like this   Stretch for 5-10 mins. Walk and stretch one lap around the track. Run 1 to 1.5 miles around the track. On average I run about a 9 minute mile.  Walk 2 laps to cool-down. Get on the bike (indoor) for 15-20 minutes of interval training. Walk another lap to cool down. Next, I do some sort of weight training. Depending on how busy the gym is, I might go into the free-weight section and do about 15 minutes of weight training. Or maybe hop on the rowing machine for the same amount of time.   At this point I'm usually done with my workout and head home. On nicer days I walk home, about a mile. During the winter I take the train back.  Now, I will admit that I struggled a lot during the winter to get to the gym. I never completely stopped, but there were weeks when I could only get there once. I'm a full-time college student and I also work about 30 hours per week at an office job. So it can be really hard to get motivated to workout. I started carrying pre-workout with me to work and taking it just before I leave the office. This always makes me energized and pumped enough to get to the gym.  The first thing I'm looking for advice on is my gym routine. I think it was good enough to get me started when I first needed to lose weight, but now I need to ramp it up to get over this next hurtle.   I've always been cautious to do too much weight training while I'm trying to lose weight, so that's why I focus more on cardio. I'd like to be lean and muscular, not thick and muscular. Though, maybe there's certain types of weight training that will help more with weight loss.  Second, I think I could also improve my diet. I'm very busy, so I tend to eat out a lot. It's very rare that I eat fast food like McDonalds, Taco Bell, etc. I usually go to this Mediterranean Grill by my office that offers very healthy options.   Most days I get a chicken wrap that includes rice, mixed greens, garlic sauce, onions, and feta (~700 Cal). This is a common type of meal that I eat at home as well. Or a turkey sandwhich on wheat with a slice of cheese.  My one fast food weakness is Chipotle burrito bowls (Chicken, Rice, Veggies, Cheese, Sour Cream, Lettuce. ~1000 Cal). Which I have about once or twice a week.  I'm also a very big snacker. I tend to try and buy healthier snacks like Skinny Popcorn, or whole-grain goldfish or cheese-itz. I usually try to limit myself to one serving or so (~200 Cal). I would say I snack about 2-3 time a day.  I drink 2-3 bottles of water. And sometimes add a flavor packet or squirt to it (0 Cal). Some days I also have a coffee from home or starbucks. Which I would guess is around 300 Cal. Though, I probably only have about 2-3 a week.  I think the snacking is an issue because my other meals aren't filling enough (excluding the Chipotle). At home, I would say I try to eat about 600 cal meals. With my total intake for the day being around 1600-2000.   I don't drink alcohol very often, maybe once or twice a month with some friends, which is usually followed by some drunk food as well.  If there's anymore information I can provide let me know.   It's very apparent that I have excess fat in my stomach and chest area. I don't have man boobs, but there's definitely fat there. I'd like to have a more well-defined chest so my shirts fit better and lose the excess stomach weight. I realize you can't target specific areas to lose fat, I just wanted to share my goals.  Sorry for the wall of text. In short, the two things I'm looking for help on are:  What can I do to improve my workout, how many calories should I be trying to burn in a 45-60 minute workout? What should I be doing differently?  How can I improve my diet? Are there any red flags? What can I add to my diet? How can I avoid being hungry all the time?  And also, any supplements to recommend? (Pre-workout energy boost, meal substitution, etc.)? "

For diner and lunch I eat 2 chapattis each with some curry.  About my workout, I wake up at 6 and jog ( actually it's more like I jog the 3/5 of the track and then walk the rest of it and then repeat). After that at 11 I do an abs beginner from the app home workout. At 7 or 8 I do a legs beginner from the app home workout. That's it for me and I am doing this every day.

A lot of the information around it is based around marketing which leaves me clueless as to where I can find the right information, and more importantly how do I know that the information is correct?  One of the things I want to know is does a proper nutrition depend on what sport you do, and  in particular how should my nutrition be for optimizing my badminton performance? Should this follow a similar nutrition scheme as for weight lifting? (I actually do multiple sports as well as weight lifting, but focus is mainly on badminton) "

So what will happen if I continue lifting weights in the gym? Is it gonna make it more painful? Is there specific exercises to avoid or to focus more that could help? Dont want to stop gym :/  Anyone that has similar problem and didn't not went for operation? 
1215,What improvements can I make to my workout?,"I apologize for the general title question. I hope my question is specific enough to be useful.  I am a 6ft tall male, weighing 200lbs. About 4 months ago I weighed 180lbs.  The last 4 months I have been trying to build some muscle, doing workouts with protein shakes, etc.  My workout, that I have been doing for 4 days a week for most of the last 4 months was:  Overhead press, 3 sets of 15 Tricep curls, 3 sets of 15 Bicep curls, 3 sets of 15  With dumbbells that weigh 25lbs.  As this became easy for me, I recently changed to 35lbs dumbbells, and now do 3 sets of 10.  My diet tends to be:  about 8 slices of whole wheat bread an avocado a can of tuna bacon eggs a banana 3 protein shakes with whole milk cheese then for dinner pasta or a wrap or a burger or something along these lines. a creatine drink  In the last 4 months I seem to have put on some muscle mass, but I also seem to have put on some stomach fat.  My goals are to get a little bit stronger/well defined in the upper body, and to minimize my body fat.  What changes could I make that would be most conducive to these goals?  Also, I sometimes get some slight lower back pain when doing overhead presses. Is this an indication that I should switch to a lighter weight? "
1216,What scientific evidence says cables build less muscle than free weights?,"Look at any classic bodybuilding book or DVD and it will say free weights are superior to cables (and machines) for muscular hypertrophy. Joe Weider and Arnold Schwarzenegger are two famous proponents of this idea. Their claim is that humans have evolved to work against gravity and free weights provide a natural gravitational force, while cables do not. I understand how machines are inferior because they don't work stabilizer muscles, but I don't understand how this logic proves cables are suboptimal.   A) Evolution  Who says humans have evolved to get bigger muscles from working against gravity? If anything, technological advances have made humans work less against gravity over the centuries. We do not toil on the farm like our forefathers. We now have cars, computers, and robots to do heavy lifting for us.   B) Contradiction to overload principle  Isn't the key to hypertrophy to subject the muscles to ever-increasing unusual stress, thereby making them adapt to this new stress? Bodybuilders know that doing the same routine over and over make their muscles become complacent. Since cables provide a force that is unlike the gravity we deal with every waking moment of our lives, then wouldn't cables stress the muscles more than free weights? "
1217,Is there a technical reason why small plates go on the outside of the collars?,"I see this a lot in olympic weightlifting. You'll have some full diameter plates, then the collar, and then some smaller, for example, unit 1kg plates on the outside. Is there a technical reason why this is done? That is, why not tighten it in with the collar? "
1218,How to establish a beginning weight program?,"Background  After a long time being sedentary and amassing about 299 lbs peak, I decided to get serious about getting healthy.  I first attacked my weight by diet and got down to about 210 lbs.  Next I started with some light cardio work, and slowly progressed to slightly more intense cardio work and weight training.  I use a heart rate monitor for my cardio and got tested at my gym for my personal zones.  The test came with a workable plan to improve my cardio workout.  However, because I can't afford a personal trainer right now, I'm still a bit in the dark about how good my weight training program is.  My Goal  My goal is general fitness.  After being sedentary for so long I have a lot of work to do to get there.  I'm not looking to be an Adonis, or even super athletic.  I'm nearly 40, already married, so I don't need to impress anyone.  I just want to be healthy.  What I'm Doing Right Now  I do cardio work 4 times a week, with two of those times in Active Recovery (i.e. heart rate in Zone 1 the whole time).  Cardio is 40 minutes of training with 5 minutes each for warmup and cooldown.  Three days a week I follow my cardio with the following program (3 sets of 10 reps):   Inclined Press (currently 70 lbs, soon to increase) Squat/Situps (currently 320 lbs, 1 rep is a set of squats and a set of situps) Pectoral fly? (currently 100 lbs, unsure of proper name) Leg curl/Crunches (currently 110 lbs, 1 rep similar to squat/situp) Row (currently 100 lbs) Calf raises/Prone iso-abs (currently 200 lbs, iso is 45 seconds) Lat pull (currently 110 lbs)   This takes me about 50 minutes to complete, afterwards I stretch for another 10 minutes.  I follow a workout with either a protein drink or bar.  I try to do it within 15 minutes, but sometimes it's 20 due to shower/changing times.  I assembled the program from what I've been able to gather from web sites that cater more to information than advertising.  It's a whole body workout with at least one day of rest in between.  The one day of cardio that I have following my combo cardio/weight training day is light intensity (active recovery) with one day of rest before the next cardio/weight training day.  When I can get through a full set of an exercise with some reserve energy, the next time I'll increase on the last set.  It's pretty tough, but the next session after that I'm usually able to get close to all three sets without needing to rest for a second.  Since I still have my heart rate monitor on from the cardio work, I incorporate it into my weight training as well.  Basically, my rest between sets is governed more by the heart rate than the clock.  I found that if I can get my heart rate down to zone 2 I can get through a full set even when I increase my weight.  Towards the beginning of a workout it takes about 30 seconds to get it down, but towards the end it can take up to 90 seconds.  Besides, it gives me a record of the calories burned.  A typical week for me would burn around 3,000 calories.  Specific Questions   Am I hitting all the right muscle groups? Is the plan balanced?  I.e. am I hitting the muscle groups in the right proportions? Considering my goal, what should I strive for to maintain?  I've heard you should be able to bench press your weight (I've quite a ways to go before then), but I haven't heard anything else for the other types of exercises. Should I modify anything in my approach?   Keep in mind that due to schedule limitations I don't have a buddy I can work out with, so I don't feel comfortable doing free-weights without a spotter. "

1220,Do I need to be over my maintenance or my actual calories burned to build muscle?,"Attempting body recomposition by cycling calories on workout/non-workout days... but, I can't find any sources that really agree on how many calories I need to eat. For instance here's two articles written by the same guy that give me an 800kcal difference between them:  [website][website]Now, one thing most of these calculations (including the above) have in common is the calories are based on your maintenance calories or BMR, plus some modifier for the muscle building.  However, basing it off your average maintenance calories seems like it should create an overall caloric deficit. So, if I normally burn 2,400kcal on an average day then I go weightlifting I'm burning an extra 500kcal for a total of 2,900kcal. Yet a formula that adds 15% to maintenance would only have me eating ~2700kcal for a roughly 200kcal deficit. (And that's assuming I don't do extra cardio!)  So, is it basically a matter of beating your ""maintenance"" so your body knows you have enough to maintain itself and will build muscle? Or should it be more than my actual calorie burn, meaning I should calculate/track calories I've burned and try to eat a little more than that? (I have a Jawbone UP3 fitness tracker, so the latter is doable... I just need to figure out the right thing to do.)  I'm also still a beginner and fairly overweight, so I know things work a little bit in my favor on this... but I'd like to optimize so I can improve faster, and get in the right habits for when I'm thinner/fitter.

1221,How do I prevent and/or treat dehydration?,"There have been a few times that after a workout that I've gotten dehydrated.  Are there preventive steps to dehydration that can be done before/during the workout?  If, after the workout or during the workout I notice that I'm dehydrated, what are some ways to combat dehydration?  Some things I'm specifically looking for clarification of:   Are some drinks better than others? Is there a best? Does combating dehyrdation solely mean drinking? Are there foods that can be helpful? Is the environment surrounding me key? Is sleeping/napping afterwards helpful?  "
1222,What is the difference between powerlifting and bodybuilding and how do you determine which one is right for you?,"From what I understand it seems like:   Bodybuilding is used for conditioning your body to ""look good"" via the use of a wide variety of isolation + compound exercises. Powerlifting is used for gaining strength via the use of only compound exercises such as squats and deadlifts.   However there does seem to be a lot of overlap.   From the forums online it seems like a novice should favor the powerlifts, but if you look at a program of established ""weightlifters"" such as Kai Green they seem to favor traditional programs with lots of isolation exercises--not to mention the popular bodybuilding personalities on Youtube such as scooby and the HodgeTwins.  My questions is, for someone starting to get serious about working out, how do you determine which program to start with and in what style? Does it make sense for everyone to start with powerlifts exclusively as suggested by Starting Strength. Do other--completely different--programs make more sense for folks with different goals other than just amassing strength? "
1223,"What sort of stretching routines, if any, should be included in the Starting Strength program?",It seems like the Starting Strength program lacks any sort of stretching routines. Should any form of stretching be done after the workouts or on your off days? Or is it completely unnecessary for the program?  Would adding a yoga session on an off day be detrimental to your progress? 
1224,"Fingers, hands and wrists specific stretching exercices","I am looking for some specific exercices for fingers, hands and wrists to improve the flexibility and not the strength. This is because I suffered of a bad tendinitis mostly to the flexor tendon of the third and fourth fingers of both hands after playing many years the piano in the wrong way.  At the moment I am looking for totally relaxing and flexibility improving exercices only for hands and wrists. I know some very famous books, like Bob Anderson's ""Stretching"", but they do not include thorough hand, finger and wrist specific exercices.  I think that what is needed now is to improve the flexibility of muscles and body tissues, especially the membrane of the tendons.  Does someone have some tips? Some suggestion about relevant books or guides?  Thank you very much in advance! "
1225,Lower back rounding,"Strengthening and building a muscle optimally requires the muscle to be stretched against resistance then contracted. Then why is it band to round the lower back,shouldn't it strengthen the spinal erectors?   Think of dumbbell side bents, they are safe and good for the quadratus lumborum ,never heard of anyone ever getting hurt with them, so why is it bad bending the spine forward? "
1226,Which muscles would I need to train for ambulance work?,"TL;DR Version:   Which muscle groups would I use when    lifting an object from the floor with a straight back  holding an object at chest height for an extended period of time whilst climbing stairs   ...and how would I best train them?    In a few months I'll have to do the standard lifting assessment for patient transport work in the UK.  I'm only very slight myself so I'm looking to improve my lifting capabilities in the intervening months, unfortunately I don't have access to a gym so am very limited in the equipment I have access to.  The assessment is in two parts and I'd like advice as to whether I'm working the right muscle groups:    Floor Lift - Lifting a 12.5 stone (80kg) dummy on a scoop stretcher up to say waist height and walking with it.  This is done with a crew member at each end.    I'm a bit concerned with this one as 80kg is 160% of my own weight, however with the equipment I'm sure it'll be manageable as even if I have the head end I should only be taking over a little over half the weight, correct?      *with better manual handling technique than that!  Anyway for this I've been assuming that as I'm starting in a squatted position then lifting up with bent knees I'll need to work on my thigh muscles.  To this end I've been doing squats, is there anything else I could be doing?  Would I need to work on my lower legs too?      Stair Carry - The same dummy is placed into a carry chair (essentially a chair with rear wheels and grips), we lift it up (again two person lift) then go up and down 3 flights of stairs without lowering the chair     I've been working on the basis that the lift for this is similar to the floor lift above (if you're at the feet end) so any advice you could give for the previous lift would probably suffice for that.  However when lifting from the head end or when in the carrying position at the feet we are advised to tuck our elbows into our sides and keep your arms in a bicep curl position.  Hopefully I can find a picture to illustrate all this more clearly.    Therefore in addition to the squats to train my thighs and my above question about the lower legs, I think I have to put some effort into my arms too in order to keep the chair up (once it's off the floor and you're climbing, all the effort is in your arms rather than your legs).  For general upper body strength I've been planning to do pushups and reading back it sounds like bicep curls could be  a good idea too.   Is there anything else that you think would help, or any assumptions that I've made and you can point out are completely wrong?  I'd be very grateful for any help you can give me!    "
1227,Are Five Finger shoes worth their money ?,"I have read about the Five Finger shoes, also on here, but I stil have a question on the Return On Investment of buying these Five Finger shoes. I have read that they wear down more easily.  My workout programme is mainly bodybuilding and I join spinning class for cardio. In what way will I benefit from wearing these shoes as opposed to ""normal"" sneakers. I do have read about avoiding shoes with a compressible sole.

1232,Trouble walking upstairs,"For many years now I have had balance problems when walking upstairs.  I need to watch the stairs and hold on to the rails in order not to stumble.  This is extremely annoying to me and I tried to fix the problem many times by just refusing to hold on to the railing and trying to walk at a normal speed anyway.  Every time, I end up doing a larger than necessary step and I stumble, or I nearly fall backwards.  I can't seem to improve at all.  Has anyone here ever seen any similar problems and do you have any advice on how to deal with it?  Is there any kind of professional that I can see to help me get rid of this problem?  I have seen a neurologist and I was told that there is no underlying medical problem, but I was not given advice on how to fix this.  I also have no problem riding a bicycle. If I ride fast enough, I even manage to let go of the handlebar, though I can't reliably take turns this way. (Yes, I'm clearly clumsier than most people, and have worse balance, but if I manage with the bicycle, the neurologist is probably correct that there's no underlying medical cause for the stair-walking problem.)  Strangely, if I take the stair steps 2-by-2, I have no problem. Walking on very tall stairs or irregular rocks (e.g. mountainside ""stairs"") is also not problem (I'm slower than average, but I don't feel the need to hold onto something).  It's only the normal stairs that I must deal with every day that cause issues.  As far as I can tell, the problem developed many years ago when I lived on the 7th floor in a building with no functional elevator, and I got into the habit of always taking stair steps 2-by-2 while also pulling myself with the help of the rails.

1233,Lose weight-> Gain weight-> Lose weight,"I have gone through multiple transformations from fat to fit to fat to fit to fat. I did many things until I found the ketogenic diet which worked great for me.  When I am on a ketogenic diet, I am extremely dedicated. Workout 5 days a week, drink no alcohol, extremely disciplined about my food, literally no cheating. Sleep on time, wake up early, drink plenty of water, socialise less, or even when I do hang out with friends, I eat clean.  I switch back to a normal diet after achieving my target weight because of family and cultural reasons with a view that I will maintain my weight with exercise and clean eating habits in a normal diet.  However when I am on a normal diet, where the expectation is to do everything in moderation, it clearly doesn't seem to work for me. I socialise as normal which is largely around drinking and eating the good food.   When I do that I don't feel motivated to work out as I am not eating clean anyway and then this goes on for months and slowly I have gained all my lost weight back again and the only way to discipline myself is to go back on a ketogenic diet.  The weight gain greatly affects my moods and my moods greatly affect my motivation to workout or do anything and I resort to eating junk. And it's a vicious cycle!  I need something that I can do long term and not have to struggle with this.   My near and dear ones tell me it is self discipline and will power, but I know it's not that there is something more. Why when I can stay disciplined for over 8 months at a time on a ketogenic diet, can't do it in a normal diet?  Are there others who have gone through the same? How do you guys do it? "

1235,Easy alternative to chicken breast? (or extremely practical way to prepare and eat it?),"I'm struggling with my diet because preparing chicken breast is a total hassle for me, so I've been trying to find a good alternative to it, something that would be as easy and quick as possible to prepare and to carry with me to eat at college and that would provide equivalent benefits.  I've read many posts about this topic, but the answers I found have been too generic, so please consider reading the rest to see my specific concerns. If this post shouldn't be here, please kindly direct me to a place where I can discuss this.  What I've been trying to do? I've been trying to prepare chicken breast in bulk for the whole week to eat 200g of it at lunch and more 200g at dinner. The first portion I eat at college and the second usually at home. Some weeks I manage to do that, but most of them I don't because I often get too busy to prepare them at the weekend or because some days it's harder for me to get access to a microwave to heat it where I am.  Blending? I've tried blending the chicken in the past to create a shake, but I was not able to prepare it in a way that made it smooth enough to be easily drinkable, so in the end it was actually harder than simply eating it. If you know an easy recipe that would make it easily drinkable without making one puke, please let me know.  Also, concerning food safety, if I manage to make it drinkable, would it be safe to take it to college and drink it 5 to 6 hours after taking it out of the freezer? I can use a thermal bag, but it wouldn't hold the temperature for too long.  Alternatives? I've seen suggestions of alternatives such as cottage, egg white, protein powder, fish... but would it really be healthy to substitute my chicken breast meals with these? I mean, would I be getting similar benefits or would I be missing nutrients that can only be found in meat?  Cottage, whole eggs, egg whites, and canned salmon are already part of my diet, but not in big quantities—except for egg white.  Please consider this: I don't like tofu and I don't eat ""red meat"". My animal protein sources are chicken, fish, eggs and dairy products only, so please don't suggest things such as pork, beef, and sausages.  Please also consider the price of your suggestion: I can't substitute the chicken breasts for something that would increase my monthly expenditure on food as I already spend too much on it.  Hear my plea! Please, help me find a healthy and practical solution to stick to my diet, I don't care much about taste, it just needs to be as practical as possible. I've been struggling with this for years, I always end up losing my extremely hard-earned gains every time I slip on my diet, and I'm becoming more and more unmotivated to continue training as I always end up getting skinny again in the end for eating less than I should. :( "
1236,What risks from fitness are there to people with myopia?,"I have a myopia and my eye glasses are usually from -3 to -4 diopters. I jog every morning on an asphalt covering (see my question) and do kickboxing, and in the next year i plan to start lifting heavy weights. How dangerous is all that for my eyesight? A doctor once recommended to abstain from all traumatic sports because of danger of retinal detachment, however this would limit the quality of my life.  On Wikipedia's article about retinal detachment it is written:     Trauma-related cases of retinal detachment can occur in high-impact sports (e.g. boxing, karate, kickboxing, American football) or in high speed sports (e.g. automobile racing, sledding). Although some doctors recommend avoiding activities that increase pressure in the eye, including diving and skydiving, there is little evidence to support this recommendation, especially in the general population. Nevertheless, ophthalmologists generally advise patients with high degrees of myopia to try to avoid exposure to activities that have the potential for trauma, increase pressure on or within the eye itself, or include rapid acceleration and deceleration.      Intraocular pressure spikes occur during any activity accompanied by the Valsalva maneuver, including weightlifting. An epidemiological study suggests that heavy manual lifting at work may be associated with increased risk of rhegmatogenous retinal detachment.   So my questions are:   How dangerous is to do jogging on an asphalt with myopia? How dangerous is to do martial arts with myopia? How dangerous is to do weight training with myopia? Can i be allowed to any of the above? If so, how can i mitigate the trauma and the medical risks?  "
1237,"Can't swim, even after a semester's worth of swimming classes, practice, and personal training,","I am at a loss as to why I still can't swim.  During a college swim class taught by the school's men's varsity swim coach (at a Division I program in the United States), we learned all the building blocks of swimming. We did lots of breathing practice, learning how to take a stroke, then put it all together to do half-laps and full-laps.  I practiced a great deal, and perfected my breathing technique and was able to swim laps.    But after the semester, he told us that we can't take advanced swim class, because that's all done at the deep-end of the pool, and that there's no intermediate training to help us get to that level of swim. I never got better at this college swim course, even after plenty of personal training swim sessions at my local gym.  My problem is: Once I attempt to swim in the deep end, I somehow can't tread water, and so I always sink, and panic and need to be rescued, either by friends or trainers.  Has anyone ever experienced this phenomenon?    Is it a quick fix?  Do I just need to add on the skill-set of treading water?  I feel that I've tried everything already - I've practiced treading water in my friends' pools many times.  I always sink.  Everyone's confused about why I can't do it.   "
1238,What Are The Symptoms of Shin Splints?,"I started running around my neighborhood, on sidewalks or streets, a few weeks ago. Recently, I took a new route on the bike trail (asphalt?).  After a five-minute warm-up of walking, I started a slow jog when I started getting pain in my right leg. The pain was mild and located in the middle of my shin and on the outside of the bone.  I stopped jogging and immediately started stretching. This stretch felt sooo good!    Are these signs of shin splints? If so how can I safely train with this condition, aka prevention and treatment?

1239,Swimming practice for adult beginner,"I've just started learning how to swim as an adult but I am feeling that one hour lesson a week is just not enough. I hardly can move forward with my arms and certainly I almost move backwards using my legs.  As a result, I am already looking for a public swimming pool to practice, but still need some type of swimming aid to keep afloat. What can I do on my own outside swimming lessons?  Now the most obvious thing to me looks like practicing my legs kick with some type of board or pullbuoy. Are both of them necessary? Would holding a pullbuoy with my hands do?  Even if most of them are cheap, I am wondering if I should just wait a bit longer until I no longer need them. On the other hand, I wonder if people get one to improve their technique on the long run. "

1241,Can too much calories pose a health risk?,"I am a skinny guy and want to gain weight.  I do regular exercises and decided that I need to eat more in order to gain weight. I made a protein shake weighing about 300g and it has 1672 calories.  Considering my daily intake is about 2000ish calories with my Total Daily Energy Expenditure (TDEE) being about that much, will adding 1600 calories everyday be bad for my health?  I will eat this much for about 30 days therefore I will gain about 7kg which is my goal. I will later convert some of the fat that I gained into muscle (not directly of course) but that's a different story.  Either way my question is: can adding 1600 calories hurt me somehow? "
1242,"Trying to lose weight, two questions","I am currently 18.6 stone. I started dieting three days ago and have massively reduced my caloric intake. For example, last night I had only 200 calories after subtracting my cardio, according to my calorie tracker (My Fitness Pal). Normally I would be over the daily guidance amount, but does this really make a difference? I read that the ONLY way to lose weight is to burn more calories than you consume. So even though I cut off hundreds of calories from my diet, I still won't be losing weight as a result of it? Or am I understanding this wrong?  On a related topic, Subway is advertised as having healthy options. Is it possible to eat a meal there that would support my weight-loss goals? "
1243,Understanding Greasing the Groove method,"I am trying to understand the workings of Greasing the Groove (GTG) method (youtube video) With this method you should only do 50 % of the max reps you are capable of but do as many sets as possible every day and with minimum 5 of minutes break in between.  In hypertrophy training on the other hand you are supposed to go to failure and you may only have to do 1 set twice a week (""The 4-Hour Body""). Also the exercises should be performed slowly (5 seconds down and 5 seconds up).  So to me GTG sounds like the exact opposite of hypertrophy, which would make it pure strength. This would also mean that almost all progress is neurological adaption. Is this correct?  Does this mean that the rep count should be low (3-5)? I see some youtube videos of people trying to go from 50 to 100 push ups by doing 25 several times a day. This does not sound like pure strength or even hypertrophy but more like endurance training. So I am confused.  Also what should the tempo be in GTG? I understand that in strength you want controlled down (loading phase) and explosive up.   What is the use of GTG for ordinary people? I would think this would be how an olympic weightlifter train, but for ordinary people it seems impractical. I could imagine this being useful for getting past sticking points such as going from a very few to 10 pull ups for instance. "
1244,Why are pyramid sets often advised for bodyweight exercises?,"A pyramid set is one following a scheme like 1 rep, 2 reps, 3 reps, 2 reps. I've seen this advised to train pull ups if you manage only very few.  I looked at the hundred push ups program, here and in the similar programs there's a kind of pyramid set (10, 12, 10, 8, ...).  I haven't seen this advised with weights. Why is this advised for bodyweight exercises? Is there a scientific reasoning behind this? "

1246,Treating Lower Back Soreness resulting from exercise,"I started working out again (P90X Lean) about 2 weeks ago and after the 3rd day my lower back was really sore. I figured it was just muscle soreness so I continued excercise the 4th day; which made if feel better that day but made it even more sore the next day.  Anyway, I've been taking it easy for about 10 days now. It is slowly getting better each day, but I am starting to get very sick of the pain. It hurts to bend over or sit straight up in a chair. I can walk just fine and am certain it is muscle related and not anything more serious.  Does anyone have any tips to speed up the healing so I can get working out again?  Should I do some back exercises, or lay off for now? Should I apply heat or cold?  Mostly I've been taking it easy and laying on the couch (sometimes with a heating pad) has seemed to be helping it.  I know it can take some time for back muscles to heal, but any tips would be greatly appreciated? "
1247,Intervals for water intake with Creatine consumption?,"I am on a workout where I take a protein shake and a creatine shake (just the ingredient with a little bit of water) after my workout. It is common knowledge that while using creatine you must intake large amounts of water. Most articles say take a certain amount everyday while on it. My question is; is it important to consume water immediately after taking it, or in intervals after taking it, or does it not matter, as long as you are getting a large supply (1-2 gallons) every day?  Update: With a very high intake of water, it is equally important to increase your salt intake? "
1248,No such thing as a hardgainer?,"While perusing bodybuilding videos on Youtube, I came across an eye-opening comment on one of the videos:     There are no hardgainers. There are only under-eaters.   Is this true? Are people who find it difficult to gain muscle mass just not eating enough? From a scientific standpoint, this seems true. The law of conservation of mass and energy would refute any claim of a person eating more calories than he/she expends, yet not being able to gain weight. Let's make this question easier: in the absense of any debilitating gastrointestinal diseases, is it possible to eat a lot and still be classified as a hardgainer? "
1249,How Can I remove my muscle weakness? Please advise,"I’m new to this site and was wondering if someone could advise  After exercise (running) I’ve been left with a lot of weakness in my calf muscles (making it difficult to walk) and arm muscles ( so weak, everything I pick up is heavy) I’m not sure if this is due to low carbohydrates or protein and was wondering if anyone had any tips to regain strength?  Also how long on average does it take to regain strength in muscles? Are there any supplements that could help?   Thank you for your time, I appreciate any advise  "

1252,Nutrition while dancing Salsa,I'm underweight (54 kg / 181cm) and therefore want to gain weight. I'm frequently going social Salsa dancing. On a usual night I'm around 4 hours at the Salsa club. Around 2/3 of the time I'm dancing. While dancing my pulse is somewhere between 120 and 150.   What food/supplements should I consume to replace the burned calories? When should I eat it? 
1253,Where is a good place to try/buy inline skates? and should i look for?,"I'm looking to buy inline skates so that I can use them to commute with work.  I'm overweight (230lbs) and plan on skating ~8 miles a day, monday - friday.  I tried going to all the *mart stores in the area, Dicks Sporting Goods, duhnams sports...and they all have very little selection and all about the same quality.  So my questions, Where do i find a store that sells more than different pairs of skates so that I can try them and choose something that meets my needs? Also, What should i be looking for?  I haven't skated in a decade, but when I did (this was in college) I was what I though ""good"" (jumping, quick turns, quick stops, stairs). "
1254,Does eating sugar before sleeping reduce muscle regeneration and growth?,"I was very underweight most of my life (BMI 15-16) and gained a bit of weight (BMI 18.5 now) during the recent months via training (at home) and eating more. Most of that gained weight is apparently muscle, my body fat is still low and not going up. So, I am not worried about gaining extra fat, and this question is only related to muscle regeneration and growth.  I started going to a gym about a week ago, my primary goal is muscle growth. My trainer told me that eating sugar in the evening is a bad thing because it affects the processes of muscle regeneration and growth. This is how he explained it:   Eating sugar increases insulin Insulin inhibits somatotropin, the ""growth hormone"" Somatotropin is produced mostly during the sleep, thus increasing insulin in the evening, especially before sleeping, will greatly affect muscle regeneration and growth   I am skeptical about two things here:   Q1. Is that insulin spike really that big? I train late in the evenings, and after training, I first eat the dinner and only then eat some cookies or chocolate, 100-200g maximum. (My body mass is 63.5kg at the moment.) I would think that all that sugar is being consumed quickly and there is not that big of a spike of insulin anyway. Q2. Does insulin production increase during the whole night just because I ate some sugar before going to bed? I would assume that it fades away quickly and then somatotropin has all the time to do its things.   I really like eating sweet food before going to bed, but I don't want to undermine my training. "
1255,"What can cause knee pain just below kneecap during a run, and how do I strengthen it?","After a little break in running I've started again, but now I'm getting pain just below the kneecap of one leg that gets worse when running and I can still feel days later in certain positions.  The muscle feels sore when I press on it, but it doesn't seem swollen.  Is this a common injury? What's the best way to strengthen that muscle, or should I just give running a break for a week? "
1256,Why do high intensity exercises hamper getting bigger and stronger?,"[website]  Things which can hamper your getting-bigger-and-stronger goal include:   ...      Endurance exercise or high-intensity conditioning, which could include running, cycling, swimming, long hikes, snowboarding, metcons, sprinting, HIIT, ball sports...   I am a thin girl and am planning to skip rope regularly as it is said to increase mental alertness. I do intend to gain weight too. Now, I am worried that this exercise will ""stop"" me from getting bigger and stronger!  Did I get it wrong? What's the way out? "
1257,Running and six pack abs,"I've been struggling with weight almost entire life (I was just  lazy). I'm 176 cm tall and I currently have 79kg. A year ago I was 96 kg.   I gave up soda, chocolate and eating after 6 PM and went to gym at least 4 times per week.   In last two months I got lazy again(started eating after 6PM drinking soda etc. and quitting gym) so I got small tummy now, but luckily I know what to do. I started running again (5km) in 30 minutes and I'm playing sport two times per week Tuesday (basketball) and Thursday (football). I rest on Saturdays, rest of the days I'm hitting the gym to run.  This time my goal wil be fit pack abs. I think I can do it (as from what I've read).    I sleep well enough (8+hrs) I don't eat in unusual hours and not so unhealthy (I think) I have a pretty active life   One thing that I don't know how to do is get the fat level in my body to low (if that makes getting abs easier). How is that achieved?  Regarding the six-pack abs, people from expirience -> Any special foods I should lay off? Any special work-out?  Like this answer says :  [website]Anything in particular good/bad food?  Additional question :  Thank you for your Response Boris one more thing. How does one measure body fat level? "

When resuming after a long break, are there any good alternative workout plans that you follow to gain back some of the lost strength and stamina before they get back to your regular workout schedules? Or do you just do the same routines with lighter weights? Thanks. "
1260,How much will I be able to bench press?,"We recently purchased a family gym membership, as our daughter has gotten into weight lifting to help her with sports. I told her I would go to the gym with her tomorrow night, and I'm nervous about it, to say the least. She is 14 years old and has been lifting weights for a year and a half. I was asking her about what she does when she lifts weights, and she mentioned that she works out with 145 lbs on the bench press. I've been trying to do some reading on weight lifting to be a bit prepared.  I'm 41 years old, male, 5'8, 130 lbs, have been a runner for decades and haven't lifted a weight since middle school, and honestly never even tried the bench press. She is about one inch shorter. She and I both realize that it will take time for me, but I'm not looking to embarrass myself. Should I expect to be able to lift that amount of weight? Or should I expect to be outclassed?   Any advice on how to handle this gracefully? Thanks. "
1261,How hard should my warm-up be?,"Kortuk and I were reading a blog post from Sweat Science that argues we should do harder warm-ups, because they increase our performance.     It turns out there’s plenty of physiology behind this. If you suddenly start running at a hard pace, with no warm-up, it takes a while before your body can adjust to start delivering oxygen to your muscles at its maximum possible rate. That’s one of the reasons VO2max tests take 10-12 minutes, rather than simply involving a short, all-out sprint. It takes time for the blood flow to your muscles to increase, and for the enzymes that extract oxygen from the blood and oxidize fuel to ramp up their activity levels. A good warm-up gets this ramp-up process over with, allowing your body up to deliver more oxygen to muscles right from the start of the workout or race, and reducing the temporary oxygen debt.   However, there's a delicate balance between increasing your activity levels and depleting your anaerobic energy stores and metabolite build up. In contrast, my MiCoach training program always has a 5 minute gentle jogging warm-up. So clearly, there's some disagreement about what I should be doing.   As I'm doing a marathon training program it feels awkward to me to 'waste' so much energy at the start of my workout. But on my 30 minute workouts, a 5 minute intensive warm-up might ensure a more pleasant 20-25 minutes workout afterwards. My hypothesis would be that its mainly important before races or interval training, where higher activity levels from the start will mean you get a head start compared to still having to warm-up.  So should I switch from a gentle warm-up to a more intensive warm-up? Will it make every workout more pleasant or is it better suited for higher performance/interval workouts? "
1262,Weird measurements of my heart monitor,"I use a ""Polar WearLink heart rate sensor with Bluetooth"" while running and my smart phone with Run Keeper to monitor among other things my heart rate. I also use earphones to get information from Run Keeper during running.  Normaly first measurements when starting running are at about 120bpm and ramp up during a couple of minutes to 140-145 only increasing slowly up to 150 or less in the first 20 minutes, depending on training intensity.  But during the last two exercises I was getting a heart rate of 160! This certainly is bogus because it doesn't match at the way I felt.   On the first run where this happened I was wearing a jacket with the cable of the earphones running under the jacket.  On the second occasion I noticed that the cable of my earphones was banging against my chest right where the sensor of the heart rate monitor was.   The weird measurements stopped after I opend the zipper of the jacket / tucking the cable to the side away from my chest.  So my theory is: the beating of the cable against the sensor was somehow picked up as heart beats.  Questions: Is this a reasonable theory? If not, what else might cause this wrong measurement?  If it is a reasonable theory, what could I do to prevent this from happening again, apart from keeping the wire of my chest? A patch on the sensor maybe? Or some ""better"" earphones? I'd like to avoid fiddling with the cable during running since I find it rather distracting.  UPDATE In another run I saw the same effect: firstly improbable high heart rate, then after some time more reasonable measurements, which I could confirm roughly by manually measuring my pulse. The difference was that my headphones cable was tucked away behind my shoulder, so it doesn't seem to be involved ...  What else could yield this effect? "
1263,What are the effects of an intense 10 minute workout?,"I came across this video.  In it the man essentially makes you do 10 dumbbell squats, followed by a similar exercise where you swing your arm out forwards, followed by 10 half burpees. You then take a 15 second break and do it again for 10 minutes. I have to admit, I was exhausted!   I was just wondering what the benefits of doing these kind of exercises are as opposed to say, a 30 minute run (apart from the obvious focus on different muscles).   How much can you burn doing something like this? Or is the point of this something different? "
1264,Maitaining current form,"I'm interested in maintaining current physical form with minimal training time, including situations with forced breaks from training.  Usually I train 3 times a week for about 80-100 minutes, most 3-4 sets of 8-10 reps (last reps being around failure in base exercises)  Brief description:  day 1: chest + triceps, bench and inclined bench, dumbbell chest fly, weighted bars, isolated triceps  day 2: back + biceps, weighted pull ups, lat pull down, cable row, weighted hyperextension, isolated biceps  day 3: legs + shoulders, squats, leg press, seated and lying leg curls, shoulders   Suppose I stopped increasing weights at certain point, and routine and diet is fixed, will I keep my form? People often write that routine needs to be changed often.  How can this routine be changed in order to reduce overall time of training?  Also, now I'm taking a forced break from training due to wrist injury(it's going to be a month or two), I'm on a small caloric deficit and visually losing some fat and muscles.  What are best strategies to recover to the same form I had before break after I start exercising again? "
1265,Proper way to do the Dead Bug,"I've been watching videos on YouTube on how to do this. I've read about it and everyone says this is difficult to do.    It isn't difficult when I do it The video show many ways of doing it   I assume it isn't difficult for me because I'm doing it wrong and I'm not doing it long enough.  This video shows a 90/90 position but this video shows two ways, one with feet on the floor and another with legs in the air.   How long should I be doing this?  Update: It's the next day and now I'm feeling it. My legs and butt are pretty sore. "
1266,"Weight size when training for power (not for maximum strength, resistance or body size)","If our main goal is to increase our power (for kicking or striking a ball, for example), what size of weight would we use?   Could light weights used ballistically be better than, say, big weights + low reps?   Can you train an explosive movement (for sport mainly) doing weight exercises slowly? "
1267,Which one of the following types of fat/carb. intake is worse? And why?,"I'd appreciate if you could please answer my question regarding fat and carbohydrate intakes in human body:  Let's say I take 100 grams of chocolate in one single day, and then don't take chocolate at all for the next 6 days. On the other hand, let me spread the 100 grams of chocolate over a week, so let me take 100/7 grams of chocolate each day.  Now considering the effect of fat, carbohydrate and sugar that's consumed, which one is going to affect me (increase my weight, body fat percentage) worse? Or is the effect equal? Assume that all the other factors remain equal, including food intake, exercise etc. Please justify your answer! "
1268,Workout to the failure is enough to get stronger. What is the need to have sets?,"As far as I understand, push the muscle to the failure state in 5 to 15 reps will help me increase muscle growth production. If I need to do more than 15 reps to get failure, I simply build endurance, not much growth. If I'm excess 15, I can add more weight to keep it under 15.   So what is the need to do more than one set? If the purpose of it is to get your muscle workout harder, then adding weight is sufficient, right? Or is it a way to not adding more weight but still gain growth production, maybe for economic reason? "

1270,Toes Hurt and Go Numb While Running,"I've been running for 11 weeks doing the Couch to 10K program, with 8-9 weeks of that being in Vibram FiveFingers Bikila LS. As I've steadily increased the amount of running in my workout, I've started experiencing toward the end of my workout (last 10 minutes or so) a semi-painful almost numbing sensation from slightly behind the base of my toes to the ends of the two toes nearest my big toe on my left foot only.    Bottom of Foot Diagram from Bottom of Foot Pain  The toes hurt in the area right around where the above image is marked ""Toe cramps"" and feel more numb and less painful toward the ends of the toes. Changing the distribution of weight on my foot as I run doesn't seem to help any with the pain once it starts. The pain goes away just a few minutes after my workout is completed and I've taken a short break.  Is this a result of the minimalist running shoes, am I possibly landing wrong on my foot, or is it something that will work itself out with enough time? "
1271,How is it famous action actors are able to do the workouts they do for a role?,"So you always hear about famous actors who work out for a specific role. The one that came to mind for me, as I was writing this question, was Hugh Jackman who said many times in interviews that he worked out 3 hours per day, 6 days a week for his role as Wolverine.   Obviously, I get why famous rich people have it easier to get ripped. Personal chefs, personal trainers, this is their job, etc. But one thing I never understood is, why are these people able to workout like this without over training? No matter who they are, they are only human, in human bodies. There always comes a point where someone over trains, and it is detrimental to fitness, or so I've been told. So what is it that makes these famous peoples' workout regimens seem immune to this?  I feel like, if I asked any personal trainer or healthcare professional: ""Hey, can I workout 3 hours per day for 6 days a week?"" They would absolutely say no, don't do that. Assuming I kept my nutrition in check, COULD I do this? "
1272,Underpronator Runners,"I have started this Running Plan [website]I am comfortably in the 4th of it. Since beginning I have been running with these ""Fila Coder running shoes""    Few days ago on searching more on running I got to know that there are different type of runners in the world:   Underpronator Neutral Overpronator   I want to run with correct shoes for myself. But I am confused and I have few queries:   When I am running slow (not sprinting, not jogging) my left leg goes of middle line of my direction of running i.e. Underpronator(also shoe sole is grazed from outside of heel).  But when I am at full pace (sprinting) I hit hit heel first and and legs remain in Neutral direction. Am I still a Underpronator Runner? Is this a disease or some kind of bad anatomy, my body/legs not designed not born to run? If yes is it curable, by exercising, or practicing correct(neutral) running? Are there pro runners in the world those are Underpronators? I am only going to run 30 mins daily, do I really need expensive shoes designed for underpronator runners?   About Me: I am 5'8"" 172 Pounds Using ""Fitness World: ZETTA COMMERCIAL MOTORIZED TREADMILL""  "
1273,How can control my heart rate during running?,"I got this new program, that tells me to keep my heart rate in a specific zone.   For example, i should have kept my maximum heart rate at 135 bpm, for about forty five minutes. But i couldn't even manage to keep it around 140 bpm. I was running at least with 150 bpm the whole time.  I tried to lower my pace, but at some stages i couldn't do it anymore i was at my lowest speed ever about 6.50.  Is there anything that i can do to adopt my self to the program ? or i need to pick up my comfort zone just by myself ?  "
1274,"Neck problems, are massages the best answer?","I'm in my mid-30s now, and much of work is done in front of a computer - all day and night.  Gone are the days in which I play basketball, run track, and hit the weight room 5 or 6 days a week.  I now have chronic neck issues -- really stiff knots on the left side of my neck.  I go for chair massages in the nail salons.  If I get lucky, I find a person who doesn't b.s. me to get me to add more money and time to the massage and really fixes the issue for me, by applying lots of pressure to the tension areas of my neck.  But the problems eventually come back, and I have to go for massages again, and hope to find someone who will fix the problem.  Unfortunately, most massage therapists at the nail salons just kind of stall and do other things during the massage session and only rub out the tension areas for a minimal amount of time, in order to make me go back for more sessions.  So, my question is:  Is there something I can do on my own to fix this problem?  Should I hit the gym again and maybe work on dumbell shoulder presses?  Bench press?  Pull-ups?    Should I seek a medical doctor?  A chiropractor?    I tried massaging myself...which doesn't seem to work at all.  Thanks, "
1275,Should I be getting more calories?,"I've been using the Lose It! iPhone app for a few months now and it seems I'm pretty consistently well under my daily calorie budget, even on days when I'm very careful to get the measurements right. By several hundred calories actually.  My stats:  Male Age: 24 Height: 5'8"" Weight: 150 lb   The app estimates I should get 2121 Cal per day to lose 0.5 lb per week (not that I need it). Also, I haven't lost weight in the past 3 months, despite being under my calorie budget. However, I work out (weight lifting) about 2 or 3 times a week, so I may just be replacing fat with muscle.  Anyway, some days my fiancée is concerned or even annoyed by how seemingly low my calories are. I'm not starving myself at all, and I don't feel hungry at the end of the day. So I'm wondering what's going on here - am I measuring wrong, or maybe my daily budget is wrong? Am I risking my health in any way?  Here's yesterday's food log:  Orange: 52 Cal Banana: 105 Cal Fzn Lunch: 300 Cal Pretzels: 167 Cal 6 oz Mahi: 185 Cal 1 Artichoke: 60 Cal 1/2 Mango: 70 Cal 1 Bag Popcorn: 99 Cal Light Yogurt: 80 Cal More Pretzels: 83 Cal Few Almonds: 34 Cal Another Yogurt: 100 Cal  Total: 1,337 - 784 under budget. And yes, I'm totally 1337.   On the surface it looks crazy. But honestly, it's mostly because we don't usually eat a starch with dinner, because we snack on carbs (like pretzels, popcorn, cereal) a lot instead. There are of course some days where it's not as bad, where I go out to a restaurant or something, but even then I'd still be like 200 under budget. So far today, I'm at 1,206 Cal eaten, and I'm about to go work out (I'll eat a bit more after). If I wanted to hit my budget most days, I think I'd have to snack way more than normal, and I feel like I'd start gaining fat if I did. So what's the deal here? "
1276,"Want to lose weight, need advice","I am very overweight, at 19 stone. I am in the gym, I go 3 times a week and normally do 40 minutes cardio on the elliptical and 20-30 on the low bike with the proper seat, I find the normal bike hurts my back.

I hear all kinds of different things from people in the gym. 4chan have a joke were they call this 'bro science'.  For example many people say to avoid bread and pasta as carbs are the enemy. While the NHS site here says I should base my meals on stuff like bread and pasta. BUT a member of staff at the gym told me that is wrong. It's really hard to know what to believe. "

I've heard this somewhere for pushups however I've recently seen someone follow it for weights also, including squats.  Any idea where this came from?

1283,Approach to the irregular weight training,"I know that the key to success in weight training is consistency and regime: never skipping a workout and so on. I manage to be consistent sometimes, sometimes not (and these tend to be periods of 4-6 months). When the real life breaks the balance and consistency, I don't manage to be get to the gym for 1.5 hours 3 times a week, sometimes it's two times a week with 5 day interval, sometimes skipping a week and so on.  While it's obvious that any really good results can't be produced during such periods, what could be the best approach to the training in such circumstances? Focusing on few base movements like squat and press and doing all of them each time? Or trying to do as much different exercises as possible for less sets? I'm not looking for a definite silver-bullet solution, but what are the options which make sense?  Thank you all. "
1284,What are some exercises that I can do for an easily dislocated shoulder?,"Before you answer, here's some background to my shoulder's condition:  I seem to have a chronically weak shoulder. For instance, when I play basketball I like to try hard to intercept passes from the other team. But in order to do this, I have to very quickly extend my hand out sideways in order to catch the ball as it is about to pass me at high speed to the opposing player behind me. However, multiple times in the past when I did this, my shoulder dislocated (probably as the ball hit my hand and pushed my arm back). But I was able to pop it back in very shortly after. I think I know now that it dislocates because I'm extending my shoulder to my side, and the further back my arm goes at this extended sideways position, the more likely the ball joint in my shoulder will pop out of the cavity if a strong force is applied to it (like when a basketball hits my hand). I believe this is called an anterior dislocation. This has also happened recently when I tried bouldering. I was gripping a hold with my left arm which was extended a bit over my head and to my side. And then as I was trying to move myself it dislocated.  Maybe I have this problem because most of the workouts that I did when I was younger worked mainly my front deltoid but neglected my posterior and lateral deltoid. Plus I don't really work out my shoulders enough these days so they are quite weak. Anyways, with all that I said, what exercises can I do to strengthen my shoulder and prevent future dislocations? And can you also tell me what shoulder muscles to exercise? "
1285,Ankle tiredness,"So I'm in the first week of c25k and just finished my second run/walk, but even in the first week I had to skip one of the running periods. My ankles and the front of my shins were so fatigued that my feet weren't lifting. What exactly can I do if I can't even do the first week of c25k? Should I just do the first week over until I can get all the running periods?  It's maybe important to note that I'm doing this concurrently with SL 5x5 which I've been doing for a long time.  I can't help but wonder if the lifting caused this. The first time I ran was after a day off, but today I ran after lifting just yesterday (squat 3 sets of 5 @ 250lb and DL 1 set of 5 @ 275lb). I don't remember my ankle being as tired last time.  I weigh 200 and an 5'9 with a bf% of around 25. "
1286,Intermittent Fasting: When to Workout,"Anyone using intermittent fasting know if there is an optimal time to workout (morning vs mid day vs evening), especially with an 8 hour eating window that's in the latter half of the day (say 2-10)?  I wasn't sure if there was an optimal time in conjunction with the work out, either for a fat loss / muscle gain perspective? "
1287,Recovery Run vs Rest Day,"I have question with regards to rest days &amp; recovery runs.  The last three days I ran rather intensely (Interval &amp; Intesive Durationrun). Today i was supposed to take a ""rest day"". (To be honest I never ran more then 3 days in a row).  But I feel like running today, but I don't want to risk injuries or risk overdoing it. So I was thinking of doing a small recovery run (3 - 4k).  I wanted to read up on the key differences between an actual rest day &amp; an light recovery run. I read (including this interesting post) that both are very important yet none actually compare them although the benefits seem to be mostly the same.  So what are the key differences between doing a light recovery run &amp; take a full day off? Do I risk overtraining from a light recovery run? Can a recovery run replace a rest day?  I thank you for your time   "
1288,Total Fast on Last Day of the Week to Cut Fat and Retain Muscle?,"I'm male, 5ft 10in, 187 pounds, unknown fat %, and I've been strength training for a while, and while I've definitely increased in strength, I want a cut aesthetic. I have a bit of fat in my belly (hips mainly) and legs that I want to get rid of. I believe a combination of intermittent fasting, alteration of my diet, and continued strength training without cardio will allow me to cut fat and build muscle. I would like some input on this plan.  The method for eating will be intermittent fasting: between 12PM and 8PM on each day, I will eat all of my calories. The number of calories I eat will now be depending on whether I strength train that day. I will eat maintenance (2200) calories on days when I strength train, and a deficit (1800) on days where I don't. I got these values by calculating my TDEE. On the last day of the week (Sunday), I intend to do a total fast eg only 50 calories and only water for the day.  My current strength training program consists of three days, five exercises each, two sets in Reverse Pyramid Training format per exercise: first set is heavy, few reps; second set is light, higher reps. I have gained in weight on each exercise doing this. Exercises focus chest, triceps, legs, shoulders, and back. Specific exercises are weighted chin-up, seated dumbbell shoulder press, seated cable row, dumbbell lateral raise, hanging straight leg raise, barbell squat, preacher hammer dumbbell curl, Romanian deadlift, calf press on the leg press machine, dumbbell bench press, standing dumbbell overhead triceps extnesion, incline dumbbell chest press, dumbbell rear delt row, and dumbbell side bend.  My intention is to add another strength training consisting of higher volume across many sets with different exercises targeting the same areas. I will alternate between my current strength training program and this new program.  My major questions about my plan:  1) Is a total fast on the last day of the week a bad idea for a strength trainer who's trying to cut fat and retain muscle? I received this tip from another strength trainer. My understanding is that it's like hitting a restart switch on my internal system. What I expect to receive is a major loss of fat.  2) Is alternating between RPT and high volume going to increase strength and muscle size?  3) Should I add cardio to this program? Besides my strength training, I work at a desk job for five days a week and go to school at night, so I don't have a lot of exercise beyond my strength training. I'm concerned about losing muscle by adding cardio, and if I need to alter my calories when I do it. "
1289,How to burn fat while doing workout?,"I use the food supplement Le Carnitine to burn fat. When using this, do i need to do cardio before or after workout? Which one is more effective for burning fat?  OR can you offer another product to burn fat? "
1290,What is the difference between a Deadlift and a Romanian Deadlift?,"I understand they are meant to work out different muscles and RDL is meant to hit glutes more.   What is a normal strength standard for them? If my Deadlift is 130kg 1RM what should I start at when incorporating RDL? What cues should I be thinking of for RDL? I.e. deadlift: neutral spine, looking forward, braced core, vertical shins, push ground away, screw feet into earth, etc. Is RDL a touch-and-go or is it a ""from stop"" exercise like deadlifts?  "
1291,Can an intense core/abs workout gives you diarrhea?,"I follow a pretty intense core/abs workout since 15 days and I have diarrhea since 12-13 days, can it be linked? I mean, does such kind of workout compress so much the bowel that it 'liquify' its 'production'? If so, does it get back to a normal when the core is sufficiently strong? (I have a weak core) "
1292,What do I have to eat immediately after workout?,"This question differs a little from others which I found here!  Basically I need to gain weight, both general weight and muscles.  What should I eat just after finishing my workout? Is it okay to eat carbohydrates first, to bring a big amount of calories, and eat some proteins later (let's say a couple of hours later)?  Can I gain both general and muscular weight by doing this? "
1293,How to do exercises properly?,"Previously I had asked for a ""minimum"" program that requires me minimum effort to remember the schedule, and minimum time to do it. The answer is to doing pull-up, squat and dip until failure every 2nd day.  My question here is: how should I do these exercises properly? Should I do it:   fast (1 second pull, 1 second push)? slow (4 sec pull, 4 sec push)? holding my pull until I can't handle no more, then count it as one rep, until I really can't do one more rep?   If the last one is best, then how should I breath when I do it? Do I have to hold my breath when I stay my pull?  I think a pull is acceptably defined as an up in pull-up, and a down in dip and squat. "
1294,What is the right protein for me? I'm struggling to find one,"I am a 14 year old athlete who plays football at academy and also internationally with a few caps. My pre-season has started and I need some protein to assist with my training and training goals. I need to stay lean, keep my body fat % really low. I need to become stronger but I must stay lean and athletic. What is the right protein for me? Please could you give some examples? "
1295,How to stay in shape during a workout hiatus?,"I had a retinal hemorrhage a week ago and was told by my doctor to not work out for a month.  What can I do to minimize the amount of muscle that is atrophied over that month, without stressing/over-exerting myself?  Any tag recommendations? "
1296,What flips are unnecessary in parkour/freerunning?,"When people in parkour videos do flips, they look cool, but is it really important to do it? To what extent should you do a flip (i.e. heights, obstacles)? Also, what flips should a beginner learn? "
1297,Hanging leg curls,"Has anyone tried hanging from a bar with a dumbbell between the legs and trying to do leg curls?  For leg/knee raises it works fine, I'm asking cause I don't want to injure myself in the gym while experimenting exercises.   For people who tried it, does the dumbbell between legs work? if not are there better alternatives, like maybe using bands as resistance or using dipping belts with plates...  Edit:  So I tried it by myself,the dumbbell between legs only works with small dumbbells. 10 kilograms at max  With the dipping belt it works fine with the plate behind the back and allows to use the most weight, but it doesn't give any resistance in the bottom part of the exercise and after a while either the grip or the trapezius get too fatigued to keep doing the exercise.   Bands are by far the best as they be placed in different ways and still work, but again has the same limitations of the dipping belt.  "
1298,Should I start exercising right away or increase my weight first?,"I'm a 26 years old guy and I used to be super skinny until I increased my weight recently by limiting my physical activities and forcing myself to eat more.  Now, my BMI is 19, which is considered ""normal"", however I'm still close to being underweight. My goal is to be a little bigger and more muscular.  My question is:   When should I start working out? Is it better if I continued my strategy until I'm 65 kg for example? (FYI: I weigh 56kg now).   Thanks  "
1299,Is power yoga equivalent to strength training in Gym?,"Since power yoga includes many postures which involves lifting self body weight. For example 5th step of Surya Namskar makes one bearing whole body weight on arms,shoulder and feet fingers. There are many such Asans like Kandrasan, sarvangasana, halasana, naukasana etc. Each of these Asans have postures which centers body weight on a particular body part. So are these as effective as lifting weights in gym because here one is lifting own body weight for several stretched period of times in one session of an hour? Will they improve muscle mass thus Resting Metabolic Rate (RMR) ? "
1300,One set 7 days/week vs 2 sets 3-4 days/week to optimize both strength and hypertrophy,"For strength/hypertrophy, is there any evidence that better results are achieved by doing a lower volume workout 7 days a week instead of a higher volume workout 3-4 days a week, or vice versa, assuming the total volume per week stays the same? In other words, given a fixed total volume per week, does it really matter how that volume is divided up between days?  Concretely, my current everyday morning routine is something like this: breakfast, 45 min walking briskly on the treadmill, followed immediately by one set of chin-ups to failure, followed immediately by one set of push-ups to failure, followed followed immediately by one set of body weight rows to failure, followed immediately by one set of dips to failure, followed by some leg raises and oblique sit ups. Followed by second breakfast.  I know I'm not overtraining because I don't feel any soreness and I'm making some progress in how many reps I can do (8 chins to 11 in 2 weeks). What is the evidence as to whether it would be better for strength and/or hypertrophy to do two sets each 3-4 days per week instead? Or perhaps even 3-4 sets each 2 days a week? "
1301,"Why is this ""minimum"" program flawed (every 2nd day do dips, squats and pull-ups until failure)?","Early this year, I asked a question to make an uncomplicated plan/program that requires me minimum effort to remember the schedule. That is, I don't need to open a schedule to check the plan. I understand that this is a trade-off, and I have made up my mind that it will take me years to get toned. At that time I had this answer: every 2nd day do dips, squats and pull-ups until failure. It has upvotes and no criticism so I have thought that someday I will see the result (1).  However, yesterday I was informed that it is not (2). I would like to know why. If you have a better plan for me, I think it is better for everyone if you answer it in the first question.   (1) Is there a simple program that I don't have to look up at all? (2) How should I do when doing the “minimum” program?  "
1302,How often should you rest? - Running,"I'm an athlete and run around 5 times a week, often 6 miles each time, how often should I have a rest day? Should I cut the 5 times a week down to 3/4 times? "
1303,Identifying filling foods for cutting / fat loss,"I'm looking into reducing calorie intake for cutting while maintaining the feeling of satiety. How can one identify foods that are filling?  NutritionData.Self.com has a useful ""Fullness factor"", but I don't see a way to sort by that.    Any ideas or other web sites that may provide this data? "
1304,Why's Stronglifts going straight to my gut?,"I'm in my mid-30s.  I've always been thin and had a very high metabolism.  I've been doing Stronglifts 5x5 for a little over 3 months.  I've increased my weight in each exercise a fair amount over that time.  I've taken breaks after running a 10k, and while feeling a little sick, but for the most part I'm sticking with the program.  I eat eggs and salad for breakfast, have a protein shake before lunch, eat beans and potatoes for lunch (or something similar).  I try to eat a burger for dinner, but my wife is a vegetarian, ""which pretty much makes me a vegetarian"", as Samuel L Jackson put it.  I eat yogurt and cottage cheese before bed.  I've gained several pounds since starting the program.  My muscles feel healthy and firm, but they don't seem any bigger.  My gut however has grown enough that it's obvious to others.  What's going on with me?  Edit: the comments imply that my question is perceived as ""how can I stop gaining weight with this diet"".  My real question is, why am I not putting on perceivable muscle, though I'm following the workout, and the dietary advice of the workout (which is, for skinny people, essentially ""stuff yourself with protein and calories"")?  My muscles aren't growing but my stomach is, is what it comes down to.  And I am increasing the weight often enough that workouts are becoming quite difficult. "
1305,How to train for marathon,"I really really want to train for a marathon, but I can't find anybody to do it with me, and I just can't seem to be able to train alone. At the beginning of the year I found someone to do these things with, and we did amazing things, from regular jogging to cycling to obstacle courses. But now he is busy with exams. How can I motivate myself to train alone? Or where can I find someone to train with? "
1306,What can I do to make my abs look their best in a very short timeframe?,"This is somewhat theoretical, but I find the situation comes up often enough.  I'm in good shape, good athletic build, etc.  I have decent definition in my abs (you can see the makings of a 6-pack or at least a 4-pack).  Like most people I've got a bit of fat in the lower abdominal section.  Also I've noticed that my stomach looks better at some times than others.  Say I was going to the beach one week from now, and wanted to do everything I could to look as good as possible, with a focus on my abs.  What would be the ideal things to do between now and then?  I'm thinking specifically about:  Diet - What should I eat between now and then, and how much? Exercises - Which are most likely to have the best effect in such a short time period? Day of - Should I starve myself the day I'm going?  Obviously I wouldn't eat 8 slices of pizza half an hour before going to the beach, but how long before I go should I eat?  Are there ""last-minute"" exercises I can do?  But what even about water?  I assume it would be a bad idea to drink anything at all, just because it would take up space in my stomach, right?  Thanks, and don't hate me for being vain! "
1307,Can resistance training change your skeleton shape?,"I have noticed many weight trainers, including myself, have quite broad shoulders.  Is this an illusion due to added muscle, or is this truly a change in skeletal shape?  I do not have a 'control' to this 'experiment' as I lifted during puberty and thus could have changed body shape due to hormones etc.  I was however quite narrow and skinny when I started.  Additionally, could certain exercises that 'pull' on your joints (like wide grip pullups/pushups) accelerate or increase this effect? "
1308,Pin squats vs full squat vs box squats,"Pin squats with pins below the knees vs Box squats with box below the knees vs  Full squat below the knee  Which squat variation is better for muscle growth in the posterior chain?   Personally I feel that full squat enables me to use the most weight, even with a 2 seconds pause. But do other variatins grant more growth since they feel harder?  "
1309,How to calculate your RMR accurately?,"For a couple of months I'm trying to get leaner, therefore I'm logging my overall food intake in order to keep a constant amount of calories deficit.  I'm a male, 22 y/o, 186 cm/6'1"", 82 kg/181 lbs. Using 6 different RMR calculators, I've gotten the following results: 1875, 1878, 1968, 2167, 2253, 2254. The major disparity between the results got me wondering how do these calculators work, since they are not aware of my fat percentage and of how ""fast"" my metabolism is. Is there any way to estimate my RMR more precisely? In addition, your I entirely count on RMR when deciding how much calories to consume every day?  Thanks. "
1310,Breaking in running shoes?,I've been running for a couple of years but only recently decided to start trail running. Usually when I buy a new pair of road running shoes I'll wear them to work for a week or two before I start running in them. I just bought my first pair of trail shoes.   Is there any advantage to wearing shoes to work/casually in order to break them in a bit or am I better off just hitting the trail with them? 
1311,cycle or swim without injury while training hard for a race,"So I was a great swimmer (2k), cyclist (100+ milers) okish runner. (10k max)  After the brain tumor like diagnosis and hospitalization, things went cold. Started running again in a few months and Nike+ Running App recommended the advanced program for my first ever 5k race. (That was top on my bucket list)  I loved the program, it's all about distance, so just for a 5k race the ""advanced"" program had me run 16K! on one of the days!  Signed up for a 10k next, got a bicycle and there's a swimming pool nearby. Next on my bucket list is a triathlon.  Unfortunately for the 10k one week I ran a lot (Advanced program has you running 5-6 times per week), on the ONE rest day I had I bloody cycled. Kinda really injured my quads.   So I figured I need to meld my swimming and cycling somehow without injuring myself, and that is my question.  How do I somehow cycle and swim occasionally when I run about 4/5/6 times a week and not injure myself?  Replacing the run for cycling on any day isn't too good right? Since the goal is to run a 10k race now. Is there a way to balance them without compromising on the running? "
1312,Is whey protein safe?,"I just started working out a few months ago and just yesterday decided to try whey protein to help with my fat loss, which I haven't made much progress in even after switching to a healthier diet.  I bought Whey Gold Standard from Optimum Nutrition, please refer to picture below.  Yesterday before dinner I decided to try a scoop of it with cold water. I drank a few gulps and immediately started to feel tingling around my body. I brushed it off and started eating my dinner consisting of brown rice and some meat and veggies. Throughout the dinner the tingling got stronger, I started feeling light headed, and my heart started racing. I called my friend who uses the same product and he said I am one of those people sensitive to whey protein and my blood glucose level is dropping. I ate some more and started feeling better after a few hours, although I don't know if I felt better because of eating or just because of time.  Today I worked out at the gym and afterward I ate a bigger dinner than usual consisting of fried rice, chicken, carrots and cabbage, to prepare myself to try the whey again. This time after drinking the whey I did get some tingling particularly around my head, but rather mild. My heart did not race. As I am typing this my head is still tingling, but it's very mild.  My questions: what is this reaction? And is it safe for me to keep taking whey protein?  Thank you!    "
1313,Is there any objective reason for the hatred towards the pulldown machine?,"While I agree that a compound movement with free weights against gravity must recruit more muscles (and in a more balanced way) than a forced path on an isolation machine, I cannot understand certain extremes like the hatred towards the lat pulldown machine, an object so easily found in nearly every gym and so easy to use.  A small internet search shows literally hundreds of variations of the same question: ""I cannot do pullups, what should I do?"" because it is a very usual situation many of us face. And, while I understand that the lat pulldown machine is not the same exact thing as a pullup, I think the similarity is striking, and I really cannot believe that someone who achieves a decent mark in the pulldown machine is unable to do pullups:    Moreover, the bar hangs from a cable in the pulldown machine, so that the path it follows in space during the repetitions is quite unconstrained, very similar to a free weight unlike other machines. And you can build up very gradually by increasing the load in very small steps from nearly zero resistance.  Instead, people give all sort of weird recommendations: negative pullups (dangerously taxing on the grip, joints and tendons in general of untrained and probably overweight novices), band-assisted pullups (where resistance is difficult to adjust and impossible to tune finely), surrogate exercises like the inverted row (the method I am using, but I hold some doubts because it is obviously not the same pulling direction) and so on.  Is there a reasonable and objective reason to avoid the lat pulldown machine? (besides simply ""it is not the same thing""). I expect either an answer related to something real that can be understood (directions of forces, names of muscles, I don't know) or perhaps some reference to a scholar paper where two groups of training athletes were compared. "
1314,Am I estimating my caloric intake correctly for a healthy diet plan?,"I am 5'10"", 192 lbs., 28 years old, male.   My BMR (just using the average from online calculators) is: ~1960 calories. I average 5 miles (walking) per day, usually around 2.5 hours of activity. Using another online calculator, this comes to ~600 calories. I do not do any weight training.  My aim is to lose weight in the healthiest way possible on a balanced diet that I can maintain after I get to a target goal. If I understand correctly, I would need to have less than 1960 + 600 = 2560 calories per day in order to lose weight.   I cook most of my meals and use measuring cups which makes it easy to estimate calories. I aim for 500 calories for a meal, three meals a day. The meals are a balance of fat, carbs, and protein according to daily requirements but I typically cannot eat more than 60 g carbs per meal. I drink an average 80 oz. of water per day, based on thirst or urine color. I don't normally snack. This has worked well as a basic diet for the last two years for me and I feel satisfied after each meal. With some room for error calculations, I am definitely in the range of 1800-1900 calories per day.  If I eat out (2-3 meals a week max) in a place that does not list calories, I will simply eat half. If I am still hungry two hours later, I know that I didn't get enough so I will eat a snack. But typically, meal portions are so calorie-dense at most restaurants that eating half is more than enough.  Despite doing this for months, my weight has either stayed the same or increased slightly (4 pounds over 6 months). Why? The only major thing I have noticed that has changed is my appetite has suddenly been bigger over the last few months. Going with my usual 500 calories per meal means I get hungry within two hours which gives me really bad headache. I am concerned eating less is unhealthy but I am concerned eating more will not help me lose weight.   What should my caloric intake be per day? How should I divide this per meal? Any other suggestions to stay healthy?  "
1315,Am I gaining fat or muscle - how can I tell?,"I've been attempting to do a high-protein calorie-restricted diet, while working out with the Stronglifts 5x5 program since early February. My follow-through for the Stronglifts part has been ""decent"". I've missed about a third of the workouts in total, but have managed to work out 2+ times per week on average. Yesterday I squatted 192 lbs.  I've been somewhat less successful with my diet. On average, I'm still eating more calories than I burn, I think. During the last 4 months my weight has increased from about 208 lbs to 216 lbs.  I'm wondering though - how much of that 8 lbs increase might be fat, and how much might be muscle? I'd imagine I must have put some muscle on because of my strength increases, but it's also easy to imagine that I've put on fat, because I haven't been sticking to my diet. Looking at pictures of me from a few months ago, I feel that maybe I look slimmer...perhaps? It's hard to be sure. Other people don't seem to notice a difference. My clothes feel a bit tighter, but I think that maybe adding muscle mass might lead to tighter-fitting clothes too.  In short - how do I know if small weight gains are muscle gains or fat gains? "
1316,Mixing high intensity and high volume in a single session,"It seems to be generally agreed upon that high intensity (i.e. heavy weights) for fewer reps, tends to make you stronger, while high volume (i.e. less weight) for more reps, tends to make you bigger by hypertrophy.  But then, there are those who for the first part of an exercise (let's use bench press as an example), lift heavy weights, with a rep-range of 3-5, for a few sets, and then drop some weight and do a few sets of 8-12 reps on a lower weight.  Is there a clear benefit to mixing high intensity and high volume in this way? Do you get the best of both worlds? Or does the hypertrophy work cancel out whatever strength gains you would have made from the first sets of heavy weights?  If you get both types of benefit, why isn't this the only way of doing it? "
1317,Please revise my workout routine according to my body detail,"My goal is to overcome my ""skinny-fat"" body. I am already working-out passionately but I want to hear advises from you guys about my workout routines. I have listed 2 different routines that I normally do, I'm currently doing routine 1.

1318,How to help recovery after long-distance cycling race?,"Yesterday I finished an anual bike race - 100km of cross-country riding with 6000m total elevation that many amateurs (over 2000) around here attempt. For most people it takes between 5 and 12 hours to finish and it is quite taxing. It's my 6th year doing it and while I usually manage to feel quite fine within 24 hours, some of my friends with less praparation complain of soreness and nausea for 2-3 days. What would be best strategy to recover after that? Including:   How to decrease muscle and joint pain and cramps? How to treat inflamated legs / butt?   I imagine marathon recovery tactics might be similar. "

1322,Should I Be Discouraged if my Muscles Aren't Sore After Exercise?,"A day or two after exercise my muscles will sometimes be sore, ""wonderfully sore"" I'll say.  I think this is common, and I know I've done a good workout when this happens.  But sometimes, my muscles are not sore at all.  Does this mean I've waisted my efforts the previous day?  Can muscles still grow without ever being sore?  If ""soreness"" doesn't matter, then how do you tell when you've done a good workout? "
1323,Transform body fat in muscle,"I have read Internet,as I read body fat doesn't play a role about help buidling muscle.As i read need diet with foods,protein etc.On the other side, specific the opposite aspect of view,on thin guys,they need and body fat.It can't have someone mass body with not body fat.What I want to say ok ,it may need protein etc the muscle but with body fat I think, the muscle , is  more visible.So,conclusion my question is if want to have a visible biceps does body fat help or it does ""bad"" to gain muscle?

1325,What's the deal with skin sag after massive weight loss?,"I'm very overweight.  I'm also starting to lose a lot of weight on a new diet/exercise program with a trainer.     As the pounds continue to drop off, how bad can I expect skin sag to be?   Can I do anything to mitigate it?   Does it last forever (if I keep the weight off), or will it change over time?   I'm a 29 year-old male, >350 lbs if that matters.    Thanks for your help.   "
1326,Can I run a 5k before a track meet?,"So I signed myself up for a 5k road race, but it turns out i have a track meet the following day. Would i be able to go hard in the 5k and go hard in the track meet too? If not, is there anything i can do in-between to help my recovery before the track meet? "
1327,What is behind the (apparently) recent kettlebell craze?,"I've never heard of kettlebells until the last couple of years.  It seems that they've kind of exploded recently, and a ton of people are extolling the virtues of these things.  I've heard that they were popular in Eastern Europe for a long time, and have recently broken out to the rest of the world.  My question is why are they so popular?  What can they do that a regular dumbbell can't?   "
1328,Muscle gain: six-meals-a-day-diet foods?,"I've heard that the best method for sustained metabolism and muscle gain is proportioning your day into six small meals. My question is what are the suggested/best/cheapest foods for those meals, besides some sort of protein? What is the easiest way to get these meals in? "
1329,How to strengthen skeletal muscles,"Was wondering if anyone could advise, my skeletal muscles are very weak, no strength which is leaving me unbalanced and un steady on feet, and my arms feel the same somewhat floppy, is there any dietary advice anyone could give? Any recovery shakes that could help? Just could do with a little guidance, my muscles are just too weak  Thank you for your time "
1330,How much time needed to rebuild your body after long pause?,"Let's say some average person was doing bodybuilding for a year or so. He gained some muscles, increased his weights in all exercises from 1.5 to 3 times. Then he had to do a break for a half a year. After this period, he sees that his muscles are mostly gone and probably the exercise weights are also lower. How long after this break will it take him to get back to the previously achieved results? Another year or less? May be there is some formula to calculate this or may be someone had this kind of experience that he can share? "
1331,Finding a personal maximum heart rate,"Heart rate zones, target heart rate, heart rate reserve, etc can be useful for a fitness program, however all depend on knowing your maximum heart rate.  I'd like to know what my maximum heart rate is, not some theoretical average like 220 - age.  What is the best way to find my true max heart rate?  Also...  For the same level of effort, my heart rate on a bike is significantly lower than when running.  Does max heart rate vary by activity, or any other factors besides age?  Thanks. "
1332,How much weight would I need to gain if I increased my deadlift by 50 pounds?,"I want to train my deadlift, and I'm curious to know how much weight I might gain if I increased my deadlift by, say, 50lbs.  Is there any literature out there that quantifies the relationship between strength gains and muscle mass gains?  I'm an avid rock climber, so I have an incentive to keep my weight low.  Just for the heck of it, though, I want to train my deadlift.  I was wondering if it was practical to try to increase my deadlift and stay under a target weight.  Would increasing the weight I can do in a set of deadlifts by 50lbs correspond to 5lbs of muscle mass?  2lbs?  10lbs?  I don't just mean training my 1 rep max (you can tweak that with pure neurological training), I'm more curious about what woud happen if I improved, say, my 8-10 rep deadlift by 50lbs.  Maybe there isn't an answer to this question out there.  Maybe its a dumb question.  :)  My strength training background: I'm physically active, but an almost totally untrained deadlifter. Actually, I've historically neglected my lower body, and focused on pullups, long core workouts, and some dumbbell benchpresses for the heck of it.  Thanks in advance. "
1333,I need some help running further distances,"I've been running for a while now, i think about a year, except these last months I've been running consistently every other day. Now, my goal last year when i started was to run a 5km. I didn't make it. I'm still doing intervals every time i run.  Now, I feel like I could do a 5km stamina wise, because when i need to stop running I'm not overly exhausted or anything. Its just that after like 1.5 - 2 km my knees, shins and calfs start hurting super much.  I've bought some running shoes a while ago so that's not it (I have Asics GT 2000 shoes for the ones wondering)  I just really wish i could run faster, am I doing something wrong? Do you guys have any tips for me?  "
1334,How is water absorbed and expelled?,I have been wondering this for a while because I can put away a gallon of water in a reasonable amount of time if I just sip it for a while. The weird thing is that I had gastric bypass surgery so I can't fit all that in my stomach at the same time. So my question's kind of a three-parter:   How does your body absorb water? Where does it absorb water? How long before the water leaves your stomach?   Feel free to disregard the gastric bypass surgery if it makes the third question easier to answer. 
1335,What type of physique is possible without use of steroids?,"Let me begin by saying I'm completely against steroids, as everybody should be.  I don't plan to get into fitness model shape, as I know it often involves extremely strict diets and starvation prior to competition.  What I'm interested in learning is what level of muscle is possible to achieve (given the right genetics) without the use of steroids.  Guys like Scott Dorn claim to be completely natural bodybuilders.  Is this even possible?  If not, what level of muscle is one able to peak at without using steroids?  I'm extremely interested in bodybuilding and would appreciate any advice as how to achieve muscle which is both aesthetic and functional.  I know many natural body builders, who appear to be stronger, in all reality are less capable of lifting than athletes.  Is there a way to get the best of both worlds? "
1336,Bench Pressing vs. Push-ups,"Does bench pressing work out the same muscles as push-ups?  If not, What's the difference? "
1337,Sample Lifespan IHP USB key file please,"I bought a Lifespan folding treadmill (TR1200i, but similar models will possibly use the same format) in a private sale and it seems it requires some online account with ""IHP"" to just update the name/age/weight/height that my treadmill displays and uses to calculate calories.  Can someone with a USB stick and some technical knowledge share a sample of what gets put on the stick?  Is it just one file?  Is it text or binary?  Is it encrypted?  I just want to make mine without their help.  Thanks! "
1338,Should I run everyday or alternate days and run longer?,"I am just getting into doing cardio and there is one question where I see a lot of conflicting information on the internet. What is better for losing fat and general health (more endurance, etc.)?   Running 25 minutes 6 days a week Running 50 minutes 3 days a week   Don't get hung up on the actual minutes as I am hoping to build that up higher but the general question still stands.   I know with weights its important to take days off to rest and recover and allow your muscles to grow but wanted to see if there is similar factor here with cardio.  Is there a clear answer on a better way to do cardio training for best results? "
1339,What is a body strength?,I want to know what is the body strength? Is that muscle building help for make a body strength?  
1340,How to construct a compound movement workout including the Super sets?,"I have been doing compound movement workout for like 3 months now, could see the results in overall strength, and fat loss, but how do I now include some super sets in that workout for looking toned? I am aiming for 10% Body fat(currently 18%). For e.g. I currently on a schedule for 4 days a week doing compound movements like Squats, Deadlifts, Bench Press,Bent over row,Pullups, pushups, HIIT, Clean&amp;Jerk, Shoulder press. Can i include some super set for isolation exercises like Triceps pushdown, Dumbell curl, Traps exercises,etc? "
1341,How many calories are burnt per hour sitting on an exercise ball?,"How many calories are burnt per hour sitting on an exercise ball?  I have seen a number of 350 calories extra per day being tossed around on internet with no evidence or explanation. I assume thats the max that has been claimed. SO it would be around 45 calories per hour (claimed)...  Does anyone have any evidence/information about this?  p.s. I have read comments/articles on the negative aspects of replacing a chair with an exercise ball. Thats a different question, i am just interested in average calories burnt per hour for male/female. "
1342,Why does my max heart rate not go above 140 bpm?,"24 years old. Resting heart rate is 63 bpm. I weight 150 lbs, 5'3 feet. I have asthma but I take inhalers before I exercise. With or without my inhalers my max heart rate does not go above 140/141 even when I'm working at the gym intensely. Even at the point where I think, I cannot push myself further while exercising and I am out of breath, my heart rate is just at 140 bpm. I am not very super fit, at least I think so. I started exercising regularly after about 2-3 years of no exercise, and heart rate still the same. For my age my max heart rate should be in the range of 180-190 bpm.  Asked my doctor too, but they said it was okay. What I am looking for is specific instances of such cases, and why it might be so for me? Any specific reason?  "
1343,Why is muscle size not proportional to strength?,"This guy claims that Olympic powerlifters working in the 1-6 rep range can increase strength without increasing muscle size.   [website]  Trained Olympic lifters, for example,   were shown over a two-year period to   have significant strength increases   with barely noticeable increases in   muscle mass (Hakkinen et al, 1988). I   had a similar experience when I used   AST's Max-OT principals. My strength   went up like crazy, but I gained very   little size.      Obviously, traditional strength   training with low volume and low sets   (1-6 reps, 3 or less sets) is not the   best approach. Strength training does   cause hypertrophy (Hakkinen et al,   1985), but it won't cause maximum   hypertrophy.   What is the scientific explanation for this? Is the inverse true? That is, can a buff guy (with lots of prominent muscle) actually be weak?  "
1344,Lean body weight protein requirements + GDA,"Using the calculator: [website]Apparently I have 28.9% body fat.  I weigh 95kg, so that means my lean body weight is 67.55kg.  If you're supposed to have 0.5g of protein per kg of lean body weight, that means I should be getting around 34g of protein daily.  Therefore, if my BMI to lose weight (1lbs weekly) is 1525 calories daily, I am getting the following figures for GDA:  zero exercise days calories                1525 protein                 34 carbohydrate (max)      183 - of which sugars       73 - dietary fibers        24 fat (max)               58 - of which saturates    18 sodium                  3   According to a previous question, we should be getting atleast 100g carbs daily.  What is the minimum fat I should be getting if 58g is the max?  And is it normal that the GDA above allows me to have more fat than protein? "
1345,Revised workout,"I'm 6ft, and weigh 200lbs.  I am at 22% bodyfat, according to various online calculators.  My goal is mainly to get a little bit bigger and stronger. I'm not looking to get huge, just to be generally more in shape in that department.  I would like to reduce body fat, however this is not a primary goal and from what I have been reading, I will see results through diet and burning the right amount of calories alone.  My workout for the last few months was:   Overhead press, 3 sets of 15   Tricep curls 3 sets of 15  Bicep curls 3 sets of 15   With dumbbells that weigh 25lbs.  As this became easy for me, I recently changed to 35lbs dumbbells, and now do 3 sets of 10.  My current revised workout is:  With 35lb dumbbells   Bicep curls - 3 sets of 15 Tricep curls - 3 sets of 10   With 30lb dumbbell   Dumbbell squats - 3 sets of 10 Overhead press - 3 sets of 10   Other   3 sets of ten pull-ups 10 pushups   I will do this 4 days a week.  My diet is healthy. I get at least 150 grams of protein a day, 20 grams of fiber, and a good mixture of meat, fruits, veggies and carbs.  I'm only interested in exercises I can do with dumbbells at the moment. I understand a barbell gives faster results, but it isn't an option at the moment.  I've seen some programs suggest increasing the weight each day. I was planning on sticking to the same weight each day until it became ""easy"", and then increasing it and repeating that process. Is this approach somehow flawed?  Are there any significant changes I should make to my program? What kind of results should I expect to see? "
1346,Tips for breaking the 18 minute barrier for 5km - I'm stuck!,"I'm struggling to break the 18 minute - 5km barrier. The weekly Tuesday race I enter finishes in a few weeks for the season, and I really want to crack it this season.  My training runs are all conventional runs of between 5 and 15km. I do no Interval training. Effort in training runs ranges from 4:10/km up to around 5:00/km on longer runs. In the actual weekly race, I'm hitting just under 3:50/km   I record most of my training runs &amp; races with runkeeper, which may be of use in spotting what I'm doing wrong. In Runkeeper you can drill in to each activity to see pace, elevation of each run.  My weekly official times have been: 18.48, 18.21, 18.15,missed,18.09,18.08  Can anyone offer tips; should I be running longer and slower? More hills? Shorter, faster training runs?  I've tried laying off alcohol completely for a week leading up the the race, and eating more sensibly, because it started to feel like a barrier that more training wasn't going to get me past - but no luck, I plateaued last week at around 18:10.  I have the Garmin heart rate attachment, which I stopped using, but should I bring this back into my training, should I be looking to run for longer at higher heart rate?  I'm out of ideas, but time is running out and ideas greatly appreciated!   Updated with answers to Christopher's questions. And Hi! Very positive about the site so far, big fan of the computer nerd versions of it, seems the fitness one is similarly helpful! "
1347,At what temperature is Creatine destroyed when cooking meat?,"Red meats such as Steak and Salmon do contain some creatine and provide a natural source. However, much of the creatine is destroyed from the heat as a result of cooking the meat.  At what temperature is the creatine destroyed? Can you cook steak medium and still have creatine, or does it need to be rare? Also, when cooking salmon, does the creatine get destroyed if you cook the internal temperature of the meat to 140F as recommended?  I am pretty much wondering how practical it is to actually get a little extra creatine from eating red meats. Links to sources would be greatly appreciated. "
1348,How does our body dispose of excess calories (physiologically speaking)?,"My question is whether all the excess energy that is left every day always go to fat, or can it be wasted or disposed of somehow? (for example by not digesting everything to 100 percent?) Now, I am not asking for ""ways"" of consciously doing this, I understand that it can be difficult, but physiologically speaking, do any such disposing processes exist?  That is my main question, but just for some more clarity:  Let's call all the energy chemically contained in a day's food A. Let all the energy received by the body from digesting that food B. Is A = B? If B is less, is it always smaller than A by some sort-of constant factor, or does it depend on anything going on in the body?  Further, let C be all the energy used up by the body for ""real work"" like driving muscles, sending all the electrical signals in the neurosystem, running all the chemical reactions that require energy in the cells and building new cells.  Now, let's say that any given day C is less than B. So now, my main question explained in variables would be: any given day, does all the excess energy (B-C) all go to fat, or can a part of it be disposed of in some way? If so, how? (again, not ""how do I do this?"", more ""what physiological processes are going on if this happens?"".)  It sure seems that way because people seem to have very different metabolisms, some never get fat no matter how much they eat (not only can their metabolism burn a lot, but it is ADJUSTING to their diet) , and others gain weight very easily with just a little excess energy.  What are the physiological mechanisms behind this?  -- Update -- Thanks for your answers, I will try to clarify the point of the question.  Basically, the point is: ""Physiologically, how do some people seem to keep their weight no matter how much they eat? (They keep the same weight if they eat a lot, BUT ALSO if they eat normal amounts). Because them doing so means that the rule ""All excess energy that is digested but is not used up goes to fat"" does not apply. For them the excess does not seem to go fat, so where does it go instead?""  For example, see links in this answer to another question: No such thing as a hardgainer?  {label ""MAIN QUESTION""}  I see only 2 ways of this happening, and I will keep using my variables, even though they are not 100%-bulletproof of course, considering such things as body digesting its own cells, thus sort-of increasing B without increasing A; C being used up for digestion (increasing B), and so on.  Think of variables as just a way of explaining the question and having a general mathematical picture of what is happening. Also note they only count the energy, not vitamins/proteins/etc.  Either  1) Any given day, ratio of A/B is sort-of the same, and depends only on a) generic personal metabolism (doesnt change much from day to day), b) that day's diet c) maybe some secondary random factors such as subject's stress level or so. This way, if B>C, there must be some mechanism in the body that can use up arbitrary amounts of energy for doing same thing, and it is using more energy if the people in question eat a lot, and is using less if they eat normally.  What is this mechanism and how does it know how much energy to use? Any specific hormones doing this? Or is it building some chemicals instead of others?  2) Any given day, if there was a lot excess energy (B-C), the digestion process for the next day is regulated in such way that the next day (or ""period of time"", I don't think our body plans in days, but just used for clarity) the A/B ratio gets higher, thus the next day's B will get lower, and this way (B-C) of the next day will be lower or even negative, thus preventing the building of fat. Is this the case? Are there any specific known hormones/mechanisms that regulate the digestion this way? (dependent on the body's general energy vector (excess/deficiency)  Or I have some very big logic flaw somewhere. In that case please just answer the part labeled {label ""MAIN QUESTION""} "
1349,Guidelines for using spinning (stationary bike) as cross-training for long-distance running,"I'm interested in using spinning (group stationary bike class) as part of a long-distance-running training plan (from half marathon to ultra marathon). Typical plans include running at least 4 days/wk and weekly mileage of 20mi to 50mi (or more). I've completed marathons before without including cycling (or much cross-training) but I want the added benefit that comes with cross-training on days off from running (avoiding injury and adding fun are also motivating factors).  It should be given that I go easier/harder based on feel, I do not spin the day of a long/slow run, and that there are day-to-day variations (e.g. the instructor and their plan for the day, the bike itself, etc.).  I'm wondering how to choose the right level of intensity and whether it is more beneficial to focus on cadence (speed) or resistance. Or is the random nature of this form of cross-training the main benefit? (I'm thinking this is similar to the fartlek run style of training.) Lastly, classes are 1 hour long - is it wise to let this type of training actually supplant some amount of running? i.e. each week let N hours of spin reduce running by N hours (up to a point). "
1350,I want to run but have a bad knee. How should I deal with it?,"After the previous post, I ran for 2 more times and then I stopped running because I felt that I needed to let the knee rest.  And then there is the feeling of discomfort in my knees, especially the right one, with no sign of getting better.  Do I need to train my leg muscle in order to get well? As the previous post suggested, there are 4 kinds of muscle I need to work with. Do I really need to train all 4 kind of muscle? Or is there a type of muscle held more responsible to the pain? "
1351,To what extent is strength/fitness genetically passed on?,"I am not talking about muscle mass, but just strength. I know some people who never touch weights, do any exercise, have terrible diets, have poor sleeping habits, live in unsettling conditions, however they have surprising strength.  One of them is a man who is 70 years old, and has the grip of a young athlete, yet he doesn't do absolutely any exercise ever, has a bad diet, doesn't move much, and doesn't sleep well either. Is this any crossover with grip strength/genetics, as opposed to overall body strength, or is that vagueness beyond anticipation?  My point is that some point are just strong despite little or no work put in, and some others, like me, make it a mission to get stronger to barely compare against some others who rarely try.  A 70 year old man who does nothing with a grip of over 120 PSI who can over power my crushing grip threatens me - it also makes me feel very weak as I am a much younger man who works out quite regularly, and I can not seem to break such strength.  It pisses me off, but is it all just genetics? If so, why should the weaklings try and get stronger/more fit if some others will always dominate them with little work/ease? "
1352,Different approaches of increasing weight in exercises,"What are the different approaches and pros/cons of each method of increasing the weight used in strength exercises?  I have been using a certain amount, and when it becomes ""easy"" then increasing it and repeating that process.  I have seen other approaches of increasing the amount of weight in each set, or increasing each day...  Is there a correct way?  Does training for size vs strength make a huge difference in the answer to this question? "
1353,long run pace not stable,"I'm preparing for a couple of 10km race taking place in 2 and 3 months. I've started 4 weeks ago a training program suggesting specific training based on heart rate, and each week I should do a long slow run.  The problem is that keeping a steady HR means that my pace go slowly down during the session. I run for more that 60 minutes, my heart rate should stay between 145 and 150, and in the first 20-30 min I can keep a peace lower than 6:30 min/km, later I should slow to 7:00 or even more to avoid my HR going over 155.  Is that normal? Am I training wrong or over-training? Am I simply not well trained yet and my body isn't used to run for more than 30 minutes or so? "
1354,Rotator cuff strengthening for shoulder overuse injury,"I like to do a lot of swimming, and recently my left shoulder had been giving me some minor pain and occasional clicking noises.  I went to an orthopedic doctor and I was diagnosed with ""Left AC Synovitis"". The doctor recommended a home rehabilitation program, specifically to strengthen my rotator cuff muscles. His diagnosis was that my rotator cuff muscles were weak, and thus I was running into shoulder instability problems  What are some exercises that I should be doing following this diagnosis? I am currently doing:   External rotations (lying on side) Arm raises while lying prone (hand dangling by my side and then raise to parallel with the floor... 90 degree angle to my torso)   What other exercises should I be doing for this type of injury? Is there anything that I should be paying particular attention to e.g. doing reps slowly (currently ~5 seconds). Should I be using resistance bands or will a soda can suffice. How will I know that I'm ready to begin exercising my shoulder through swimming / pushups again? "
1355,the speed of a person drinking water and the benefits in variations,"I woke up this morning after having a few drinks last night and felt particularly dehydrated.  Now, what I proceeded to do was drink a pint of water in, more or less, one go. I then went on to drink another pint at the same rate about 30 mins later. This resulted in me desperately needing to urinate soon after.  This made me think about the pros and cons about the speed at which I drank the water. My body obviously couldn't handle all that water in one go, so got rid of it. However, my body needed water and still did after the two pints of water. Therefore, what if I had slowly sipped the two pints of water over let's say 2 hours. Would my body have been able to use more volume of water from the amount I consumed?  In conclusion, is drinking water at a fast rate a waste of resources? "
1356,Position of weight during weighted pull ups,"I am finally able to do 5 pull ups. As this puts me in the optimal rep range for strength gains I thought about adding weight to stay in that rep range.  I do my exercises at home, that's why I thought about loading a backpack with dumbbell plates. I really like the effect pull ups have on my core (I often had sore abs after a day of ""greasing the grove""-style exercise). While weights in a backpack increase the resistance on my upper body, I fear that my core training is neglected.  Are my worries justified? How do different positions of weights (on the back, the chest, around the hip, on the feet) impact pull ups?  "
1357,Noticing a Lack of Iron In My Diet,"I've been using a program (MyFitnessPal) to track my diet and have noticed a slightly disconcerting trend: it always says I am below 100% of my daily recommendation of iron.  My current diet regiment has 2 rules: 130+ g/day of protein and no more than 2k calories (even on heavy (1-2 hours) cardio days). The reason for the latter is I am in a cutting phase, aiming for a single digit body fat percentage.  What can I do to up my iron intake? Are pills going to be required? Do I need to start eating round steaks again? Beans... seriously, beans? "

What is the best course of action to bring them inline with my other lifts?     A related question - what SL5x5 accessorises would help to increase muscle mass in a more balanced way?   My chest and arms seem to be lagging. I have already recently added dips and chins on their respective days.   Would it be a good idea to add in Incline DB Press or Inline flyes to target the clavicular head of pectoralis major? Should I add lateral raises to target the lateral head of delts? Any other muscle groups being neglected?      Coming to the end of the program in the next couple of months - what would be the best program to move onto after SL5x5?   I will then be focusing on aesthetics (good overall physique) and hence am looking for a program for someone who:   only has free weights (I have a home gym with squat rack, bench, barbell &amp; dumbells, dip/pull-up station) likes 3 times a week (4 at a push)  "
1359,New Workout Plan Causes Soreness,I'm in the second week of trying P90X and after I do the plyo x workout I can barely walk afterwards. This last 3-4 days. I have a physically demanding job and spend 8-10 hours a day at work and use a elliptical machine every other day as well. I was hoping to space out the extreme factor of P90 by adding the elliptical in there but it backfired.  Is this normal? Any suggestions as whats going wrong? 
1360,Neural Adaptation Training vs. Hypertrophy Training?,"I see training broken up as neural adaptation and hypertrophy.  One type of training allows your nervous system to fire at a maximum level while the latter allows you to build size and muscle.    The question is does hypertrophy training assist for a greater eventual neural output?  Meaning if one gains muscle and gets bigger, do you believe there is a greater potential for that muscle to fire or is your neural ability entirely dependant by your genetics?  I mean you can't have a donkey win a Kentucky Derby...but could a low level genetic human being be trained correctly through hypertrophy and neural training to become a professional athlete? "
1361,Squatting with dumbbells. Cannot reach parallel. Is it really important?,"I'm about to start working out at home. I have 40kg x 2 dumbbells and want to squat with them.  Given I keep the dumbbells at my sides, because of the diameter of plates it isn't possible to reach parallel or any deeper before the dumbbells touch the ground. The maximum possible depth is a bit higher than parallel.  (Also I'm not strong enough to keep a pair of 40kg dumbbells at my chest)  So how important the depth of squatting is in this particular case?  AFAIK, my glutes and hamstrings are not going to work hard enough if I don't go low. But I'll target them with other exercises.  Are there other things that I should consider/keep in mind if I decide to not squat low?  Thank you.  EDIT: Thank you everyone for useful suggestions.  I'm accepting David Brown's answer. I think, given the way my question is phrased, his answer is the most relevant.  But I personally decided to drop the weight to the point where I can actually clean the dumbbells and keep them at my shoulders/chest. I hope this weight will increase over time :)  So all the suggestions of decreasing the weight or using a platform are really appreciated. "
1362,Can you take in too many electrolytes during endurance events?,"I know I can become subjected to hyponatremia by drinking too much water and not replenishing my electrolytes.  But is the opposite possible?  Can I put too MANY electrolytes into my body (while still putting in the correct amount of fluid) during an endurance event?  I once had a Dr. tell me ""you can never drink too much gatorade"", indicating I would not overload the electrolytes in my body to an unhealthy or dangerous level.  Is that true?  Do I not have to worry about electrolyte overdose?  UPDATE:  I should clarify that I'm asking the question for extreme endurance events, such as 100-mile and 24-hour races. "
1363,How to optimize long term health benefits of 30 minute bicycle commute,"I have a 7 km bicycle commute to and from work five days a week that I try to keep going all year round. This is the only exercise I get.  If I pedal like crazy (but still abide by the traffic rules) I can make it in 24 minutes and be all sweaty when I arrive. My other alternative is do it in about 30 minutes and not break a sweat.  From a convenience perspective I'd prefer to spend the 6 extra minutes and arrive fresh, but I'm wondering what's best from a long term health perspective? Will exhausting my self give more in terms lowered risk of heart disease etc? And how much of a difference will it make? "
1364,"I am unable to do a push-up, how can I improve?",I'm unable to do push ups. I have problems balancing my weight during the exercise. What am I doing wrong? Do I have to do specific warm-ups or is there anything else I can do to improve? 
1365,Only 500 Calories even though other GDA values have been achieved,"UPDATE 2:  Managed to get all nutritional values correct, and have got the calories upto 1000.  Still missing 500 calories.  If everything else is ok, but calories are missing 500, is that OK for health reasons?  Here is the spreadsheet: [website]UPDATE 1:  I didn't save the old version, but here is a newer version: [website]It is working out to about 500 calories less than I need, but too much fat.  ORIGINAL QUESTION:  Based on my BMI, my GDA is:  zero exercise days calories                1525 protein                 34 carbohydrate (max)      183 - of which sugars       73 - dietary fibers        24 fat (max)               58 - of which saturates    18 sodium                  3   I have converted this into 1 meal so far and roughly get the right amount of everything in the list above from protein to sodium.  For example 35g protein, 100g carbs, 50g fat, almost 3g sodium etc etc.  But it's only working out to around 500 calories...  So I am not sure what to do now.  Is 500 calories enough if all the other values have been reached, or do I need to triple all the values just to get 1500ish calories, or do I need to get 1500ish calories without tripling the other values?

1366,Exercises with a Torn Wrist Tendon,"For the past month, I noticed that I developed about a 1/2 inch size lump on my left inner wrist.  I suspected it was a cyst, but after seeing the hand surgeon I was told that I have a torn Flexor carpi radialis (FCR).  The doctor gave two options:   8 weeks in splint or 8 weeks in cast   I am pretty active with cardio (running, plyo) and weights but I am trying to determine the best option. No matter the choice I make, I want to still work out.    What are my options with this type of injury?  Are there any strength training, cardio choices with this type of wrist injury?    Just as a side note, any thoughts on cast or splint? "
1367,How do I know if I'm training too hard?,"I'm an averagely built guy (183cm, 85kg, 20% body fat) that's looking to build a bit of muscle, lose some fat, and generally turn some heads if I ever go running topless down a beach, but I've got a bit of a problem when it comes to constantly being tired after working out. How would I know if I'm training too hard? I'll try to (briefly!) illustrate what I'm doing at the moment:   Mondays - off day Tuesdays - cardio (usually stationary bike) for 60-70min @ 160BPM heart rate Wednesdays - resistance training, 4 sets each exercise with max weight I can manage with 12-10-10-8 reps, doing: bench press, shoulder press, squats, pull-downs, push-ups and abs Thursdays - off day Fridays - same as Wednesdays, just with different exercises: bent-over barbell rows, single-arm rows, squats, pull-dows, push-ups and abs Saturday - off day Sunday - super-set day, 3 rounds of 10 reps of each exercise (no rest between exercises, 3 minute rest between sets) on max weight I can complete them with doing: bent-over barbell rows, bench press, squats, pull-downs and rowing machine for 400m   Each of my days at gym take about an hour, and every time I'm finished and can't function for the rest of the day as I'm so tired. I eat (honestly) 3 meals and 1 snack a day, all carbs low GI, and have a protein shake with added L-Glutamine directly after training sessions.  Is it normal to be so tired after training? Or am I just expecting too much and should decrease the weight?  Update (18 October)  Thank you everyone for your thoughts, answers and comments, and I wish I could mark them all as correct as they all share valuable information and insight. I realise that there are a few questions within this one (specifically ones on nutrition and training habits) that might deserve their own question sections, but for the purposes of this question you all have given me much needed food-for-thought that has eased my mind.  Update (24 October)  As mentioned by Adam in his very insightful answer, one of the best ways to figure this out is to realise that you need to keep learning about yourself, and with this in mind here are a few things I've learnt along the way that's helping me:   a rest week every 5th week works great for me pushing myself to ""failure"" was a very bad idea if you're getting tired after working out, that's ok...if there was something seriously wrong, you'd know! lightening the weight / resistance slightly and adding 1 or 2 reps gave me a just as satisfying workout without the ""kill my muscles to failure"" way of doing things nutrition is important, but when I feed myself was also just as important - eating 2 hours before working out, followed by a protein shake 30 minutes before gym, then having a low-GI carb drink on hand during my workouts has helped to keep me going a lot better don't underestimate the effect of stress (work or otherwise) on your energy levels - a stressed mind makes a stressed body   With so many ideas and products out there, and combining it with the fact that we're all different, really gives you thousands of things to try, but when you start figuring out what works for you, that's the real reward.  Thanks again for all of your truly helpful answers guys, I wish I could mark them all correct, and I also hope this post helps someone else sometime! "

1372,Do fitter people have higher heart rates while exercising,"I know that fitter people have lower resting heart rates but what about while they are exercising?  My guess is that because it is 'better' the heart can now achieve more beats per minute and so the max heart rate while exercising would increase.  And exercise the same as before would have a lower heart rate? (eg. running 1 km in 5 minutes while unfit would have a avg heart rate of say 150, while doing the same thing after getting fitter the avg heart rate would now be 120).  Would putting in the same effort during an exercise have higher or lower heart rates after getting fitter? "

(In Pilates, you start pushups from standing, bend over from your waist, and walk your body forward to a standard pushup position.)  What are some correct methods to transition from lying on your back to standing up and vice versa?  For a while I would lean over to one side, push off with my left arm until I got to a certain height, then lift up with my legs.  This was eventually making my left elbow sore though.

1379,Passive work out?,"Are there passive ways of work out?  Basically I'm quite lazy, for example running is tiresome, stretching is also somewhat painful. So pls suggest some passive ways of work out, that are easier to keep doing , instead of normally active ways ?  One example of passive work out is massage: it build up muscles but one only need lie down ( and endure some pain).  A similar one is lie on the bed on the back, stretching out the head and shoulder, so to stretch the neck back -- office life make my neck a bit curly.  Another one is like horse riding , as the horse keeps jogging , one need maintain the balance hence exercise the muscles on the waist.  Another passive way, I'm not sure if it's true, is to work out muscles on the arms by tying one's hand to a hook or rope and lifting him up, then the body weight will stretch the arms and strengthen them.

1380,"How is energy derived from muscle, fat and glucose at different intensities?","I have learned that during aerobic exercising the body converts different sources of energy: glucose, fat and muscle. However, different ratios are used in different situations.   So what are the ratios by intensity? I once had a link to a page where this was explained, the Wikipedia article about exercise intensity lacks muscle tissue as energy source.  Also, the ratio of these sources changes with time of activity. I heard that after about 30-40 min of cardio the main source of energy switches from glucose to fat. How does this affect the amount of muscles burned? "

1385,Benefits of having low salt diet?,"I am totally aware of the health benefits of having moderate amount of salt (Sodium) in a balanced diet and also down sides of having too much. However, I can see that, in so many healthy cooking recipes they mention to use low salt, no added salt and similar sorts  ingredients to use for cooking.   As an amateur bodybuilder what benefits I am looking for, by reducing the amount of salt intake in my diet?

1386,Protein to calorie ratio of beans and pulses vs meat and fish?,"I do some weight lifting so I would like to have a fairly high protein diet. However id also like to eat a bit less meat, fish and eggs.   I know that nuts, seeds, beans and pulses are the best non-animal sources of protein, but how they compare per calorie?   EG if you had 100 calories of chicken and 100 calories of lentils, how much less protein would the lentils contain?   From googeling this I can find lots of resources that tell you how much protein foods have per weight, but this isnt useful for me. Lentils weigh less than chicken but I would eat a larger portion.

1387,relationship between power and body fat,"When throwing a punch it's often recommended one throw ones weight into it. Does it make much of a difference with what constitutes that weight?  For example, say you have a guy with 130lbs lean mass and 10lbs fat (ie. 7% body fat) and another guy with 130lbs lean mass and 50lbs body fat (ie. 38% body fat). Would the 38% body fat guy be able to throw a more powerful punch simply because he weighs more?  If so than this also makes me wonder... what other ""exercises"" would being overweight be an asset? Like would the 38% body fat person in the above example be able to do better at standing med ball tosses than the 7% body fat person simply because he'd have more weight to leverage when tossing the ball?

1388,Get anaerobically fit for a squash tournament in a month,"I am a 23 year old healthy male who plays squash at a national level. In 40 days, I have an important tournament coming up. I am in a good shape compared to the everyday guy, but not in a good enough shape to compete at a high level. I can run 8 miles in an hour, if that gauges where I'm standing fitness wise.   I am currently carrying easily 10 pounds more than I should (6'2"", 195lbs  / 1.85m, 88kg).  I would like your opinion on how to proceed in order to improve my fitness quickly over the next month. Squash is a very anaerobic sport, with a lot of quick bursts combined with necessary muscular endurance.  I have searched the internet but I can't quite wrap my head around it: Interval training, sprint training, how much of those? Should I focus more on long runs in the first 2 weeks to lose weight and then do some sprint training? Or should I hit the weights? I feel I have very little knowledge about fitness.  How would you get in a killer shape in a month? "
1389,Why soreness happened as late as 30 hours after excerising?,"Two days ago at the evening (30 h ago) I did interval excercise after a month of inactivity (except for everyday biking to and back from work).  Yesterday I felt little soreness and did nothing more than biking to and back from work (I thought that soreness was everything I could expect and I would be ready to excercise the next day, i.e. today). But today I feel horrible, soreness is really extensive.  Why it happened 2 days after (30 hours later)? What did I wrong? How could I prevent the soreness from appearing so late? "
1390,How do I track improvement in my box jump?,"The gym I currently train at doesn't have equipment for Olympic lifting with barbells, so instead I'm using dumbbell Olympic lifts and box jumps (with either one leg or both) for my power/explosiveness training. However, I'm a bit lost as to how to measure my box jump progress, and how much improvement I should expect in a given period of time.  With my barbell power clean, I knew that as an average-size somewhat-athletic male new to lifting, I can expect to add roughly five pounds to my power clean every week or even every workout until I reached approximately a little under my own bodyweight. I don't know what to add to my box jump (height? reps? weight?), or how much, or how much to expect in a month or a year.  My current program is, roughly:   Light 10- to 20-rep back squats, circa 40kg, for hip mobility 3 sets of 5 front squats, circa 75kg, with 2 to 3 minute rests, during which I do a set of 5 box jumps at approximately hip height, making for a total of 3 sets of 5 box jumps supersetted with the front squats 1 set of 5 deadlifts, circa 130kg OR 3 sets of 5 one-arm dumbbell snatches circa 24kg 3 sets of pull-ups, ~10-12 3 sets of dips, ~15-20 occasional metcons from Catalyst Athletics or Ross Enamait   Keeping in mind that my goal is to use it as a training tool to develop explosive power (not to improve my box jump per se), how should I measure progress with the box jump? What kind of progress should I expect? Should I be jumping six inches higher after the first month, or an inch higher per month for the first year, or should my ability to do more reps increase while the height stays the same? Should I keep the box height constant and measure improvement with a vertical jump test? Personal experiences welcome, as are references. "
1391,Can shoes mask injuries or weaknesses?,"A little background: I got a gait analysis from a major sports therapy hospital, and she said I overpronate and suggested me some stability shoes. I also have a weak IT band, which I'm currently doing exercises to improve.  I just bought a new pair of running shoes, and my legs are feeling tender. It seems that each time I buy new shoes, my legs start to hurt again, injuries I'm sure are related to my IT band issue.  Is it possible that my old running shoes were masking certain weaknesses that these new shoes are highlighting? Or is it just my legs getting used to a different pair of shoes? "
1392,Extremely sore legs after plank exercise,"I started doing planks in the hopes that stronger abs would help me with my lower back pain, however, after I started doing them my legs have become uncomfortably sore. The areas that ache are the front and back of my thighs, as well as the area right above my achilles tendon.  Is this a result of bad form, or is it a normal result from doing planks? I am doing the exercise in front of a mirror, and as far as I can tell, I am successfully keeping my back straight. Are there any variations of this exercise which will allow me to strengthen my abs without being in pain when I'm walking? "

1396,Coconut milk or normal skim milk?,"Question  For a balanced sportsman doing crossfit (1x to 2x per week), should I drink coconut milk or diary skim milk?  Background  As a sportsman trying to have a defined body and the energy to exercise can be complicated sometimes.  I know that protein is important for muscle gain, and that to be defined, fat (specially saturated fats) should be avoided.   Recently I have started to see a huge increase over the number of crossfit celebreties that drink coconut milkshakes after workouts and an ever increasing number of sportsman (and women) recommend coconut milk instead of regular milk.   This is specially true among vegans or among those who avoid taking protein from animal sources. According to them, coconut milk is healthy and good for you.  Problem  I was surprised when I checked the nutrition label for coconut milk.  According to the sources from USDA:   Coconut milk nutrition Diary milk nutrition   One can immediately see a problem with this: coconut milk has 104% of the recommended amount of fat.  Now, fat is not bad nor evil per itself. There are two main kinds of fat (unsaturated and saturated), one is good for your heart and circulatory system overall (unsaturated fat, like in raw olive oil), the other is what gives you heart attacks (saturated fat).  The problem with coconut milk, is that is filled with saturated fat (the one that gives you heart attacks).  Now I have to wonder, how can something with so much saturated fat, be considered so healthy by the community?  Questions  So at this point I am pretty much confused:   Is one type of milk healthier? Why is coconut milk regarded as healthy? Why is coconut milk used by sportsmen and women? What should I take?   Additional Note  Please consider that I am not lactose intolerant, and that for a normal person, there are also lactose-free diary milks as well. "
1397,"Right abs are more worked (and possibly poor posture), how can I correct that?","Recently I've been jogging and working my arms with some exercises. Although I feel both legs and arms more or less equally tired I also feel I have much more strength with my leg and right arm. I also feel that the right side of my abs are more tired (one or two days after the exercise), besides this I can see that my right shoes are more worn... so I was worried about this. Now that I'm starting to do more exercise I would like to have both sides of my body more or less equally developed. What should I do? Should I try to put more effort in my left side consciously? "
1398,Carry dumbbells while running,"Recently I have been training hard for my marathons and I feel that it may not be enough to become a champion.  So I came up with the idea of carrying weight while running. I have got 2 dumbbells each weighing just 4 lbs. Can I carry these on my hand and swing my arms normally, the way in which I do while jogging? Will this improve my strength and/or my speed?  Also please tell me, what is the extent of weight that I can carry, if at all this idea is good? "

1400,Training despite having an unbalanced back (asymmetric),"I have an asymmetrical back, it is not really visible when relaxed, but I noticed that I can easily contract and pop up my right deltoid while the left one, is impossible.  A doctor told me that after a while training I would do improvements on my left deltoid, but after two years I still cannot pop it up. Furthermore I noticed when deadlifting that my asymmetry starts being visible, since the contraction clearly shows more on my right side. However, during a dumbbell bench press or military press, I never noticed a clearly weak left side.  I always bench pressed with dumbbells, but after feeling a barbel bench press I really want to do it more often. I know that most people is not perfectly symmetrical, but I am concerned about one day having an unbalanced back when relaxed.   The question is How should I structure my workouts to ensure a proper balance? Is there anything I can do to improve my symmetry when contracted? Should I always avoid barbells?  "
1401,Optimal way to end treadmill run?,"Running on a treadmill and you've nearly completed your defined goal for the day. Say, 5K @9K/h. You feel the need to go that extra mile - but you're stuck. Which is better for long term physical fitness? Should you:   Run for longer - run that last 200-300m until you hit your limit? Run faster - push up the speed for the last 200m of the run, simulating a sprint to the end? Turn up the incline for the last 200m - keeps your stats neat and tidy, while still putting in that extra bit of effort? Take it easy, and make a self promise to increase the speed/distance/incline of the next run, or moving the next run forwards a day? Take it easy - you've managed to achieve your objective. Enjoy the fact you've still got some breath left!   Not that I've spent the last ~35 minutes obsessing over this while running at 9k, you understand. Help? "
1402,Is resting affected by office work?,"I'm a computer programmer and I basically sit around for 8 hours each day just staring at the screen, coding. I started working out for about 3 months now. I'm working out from 12:00 to 12:40 pm before lunch and eat afterwards.  Is my workout time okay? Or should I work out in the afternoon, after working hours (6:00 or 8:00 pm perhaps) so that I'd go straight to resting?  Am I losing gains when I work out and don't rest afterwards, but do office work instead? "
1403,Is keeping my HR greater than 185 for 15 min safe?,"Two days ago, I tried a 20-minute tabata workout and my apple watch (worn around my arm not wrist for increased accuracy) said that for 15 min my hr was 185-194 and it stayed above 120 for over 30 minutes post-workout.  I actually had fun pushing myself that hard and I'd like to make it a staple of my cutting routine. After my hr dropped back down I felt fine. Is it safe to have that high of an HR for that long?  I'm a healthy 20-year-old male in pretty good shape, with no heart problems or family history of heart problems.  I'm not asking for specific medical advice, rather is there a large number of people dropping dead from this type of workout? "
1404,Pull weights while running,"Previously I had asked about carrying hand weights while running.   Can we pull weights while running? Tie a rope to our hip and the weight. I am planning to run on the beach sand nearby.    My question is, is there any use in doing this? Will I improve my speed or my strength or both? "
1405,How to finish Half Maraton in under 2 hour? I have 4 months to prepare,"I run a half marathon in January 2016, completed this in 2 hour 40 mins. After that I got little lazy and didn't spend much time in training. Sometimes I go for running around 8 KM, around 2-3 days a week. Problem I face is after 1 km of running I got exhausted so after a kilo meter I brisk walk for around 200 meters and then start on running again. I am basically a very slow runner :(   Now I have another half marathon coming in December 2016 and I want to complete this in under 2 hour. What should be my plan of training? How many days a week? How many KMs daily? How to resolve issues with 1 KM exhaust? What I should eat to meet these goals?   I know these are lot of questions but any help would be much appreciated.  "
1406,workout with minimum protein,What will happen if peoples workout and don't take enough protein or take less protein than the required amount and consume enough carbohydrates &amp; fats?  Example : if person need 150g per day as he is working out for muscle gain. What happen if he take 100g or 50 g protein ? 
1407,Is a training plan necessary/preferred when I don't have the goal of running a specific race?,"I recently timed myself running a 5k. I don't have any previous serious exercise experience, although in the past there have been periods when I've run a bit. My time was a bit under 30:00, and I've done it a few more time since, going as quickly as 26:50.   I also discovered, via simple googling, various race training plans. These all seem to be focused on training for a particular race in a certain number of weeks, and combine a bunch of different types of runs at varying paces, distances and intensities. I have no reason to doubt that such plan is the best way to train for a specific race, but that's not my goal -- I just want to add exercise to my life.  Would it be bad forgo such a plan and just run a 5k a few times a week? I'd like to do the simplest thing possible, because I think it will make me more likely to stick to it. I would of course reconsider, however, if a more varied routine would confer significant additional benefits or help avoid injuries.  (Why 5k? No reason in particular, it just happens to be a standard length that matches up well to the amount of time I want to spend running each session.) "

1409,Do protein shakes really damage the kidneys?,"I've been reading about protein shakes, it's benefits and side effects. However i've used it many times as my post workout recovery drink.  I have no doubt in the benefits i get in my protein shake, i gained mass ( i was a skinny guy back then) , and i'm not talking about fat mass, i gained muscle, Now i've read that protein shakes actually damage the kidneys and the liver since the body cannot synthesize the protein very well.   This article i've read says it damages the kidney and liver:   [website]But other articles suggest that protein only damages more those persons who have already pre-damaged their kidneys, in other words it only worsens it , but does not cause the damage itself.  Because of conflicts in what i should believe in. I'd like to ask from you, who have experienced drinking protein shakes, probably long term or short term. How true are these side effects? And can you mention how long have you been taking protein shakes?and your experiences on this. Thanks! "
1410,Is 21 minutes of bodyweight training really enough?,"For a bit of back story, I did a lot of sports when I was younger, but stopped when I went to University, put on a lot of weight and ended up weight 14 stone. To slim down I took up running, and lost a lot of weight (down to 11 stone), but hit a plateau and then took up the Insanity Workout. To try and get bigger muscles, I added the Insanity Upper Body Weight training to the program, and do that every Monday, Wednesday and Friday on top of the usual workout.  I've hit a plateau with that now, and feel as if I'm not losing the fat around my abdomen, and not really gaining any growth on my arms despite the weight training. I looked into P90X, and was ready to start that, but I noticed some reviews stating that it's too long a workout, and can cause injuries. I must admit, I'm doing 90-100 minutes now on 3 days a week, and it's probably too much, every day at 90 minutes does sound too hard.  Reading up on some workouts online, I found the 21 minute Bodyweight Burn (BW3) workout and it was an attractive prospect, as it would significantly reduce the time I spend every morning working out, and give me free time. Same goes for the  Mark Lauren workouts, and that's only 3 times a week. Can 20 minutes a day, or even just 3 times a week be enough? Or is this too good to be true?  Just to note, I want a DVD workout that I can do in my garage every morning, as it works well for me at the moment. And my goals are bigger arms and a flatter abdomen. "
1411,Grouping and ordering workouts for a 3-day workout week,"I've been familiar with targeting a muscle group each day for example, chest for monday, legs for tuesday, and so on.  The constraint is: I can only workout 1 hour each day for 3 days a week because of my busy work schedule . and that's it.   If I work on chest on monday, then arms on wednesday and then legs on friday. I left out my abs, or back or shoulders and that's not good. They say i should at least group my workouts like targeting two muscle groups each workout session.  My problem is: How do i order these workouts?what do i work on monday? and what two muscle groups should i do?  Say:    monday - biceps and triceps (they say it's good to group these two).   wednesday - legs and abs    friday - chest and back   But i'm not sure it's a good ordering because i just made this up. How do i fit in a full body workout to a 3 day workout week? Thanks! "
1412,How can I lose weight more effectively with bodybuilding?,"I heard something about the simultaneous practice. To the best of my knowledge, it means that one can do some exercises after bodybuilding to lose more fats. Is it true? What is the best way? I'm 81 kg and I wanna be 75 kg. "
1413,Recreational vs Competitive Breaststroke Timing,"Looking around some information about breaststroke technique, I am seeing different information about the timing of the kick.  With the recreational breaststroke (with head all time out) I tend to have my legs already flexed when breathing and kick when extending my arms. However I am trying to do this stroke and maintain a straight streamline as long as posible with the head under water.  After looking around I see different recommendations about when to start flexing my legs preparing for the kick   When taking the head out (elbows on chest) When going down / extending arms When arms are already extended   Which one is the right timing? Does it change when keeping the head out always?  So far my feeling is that I should delay flexing my legs as long as posible, at least not even start flexing during the time I am taking a breath, with the kick happening only after arms are completely extended. "
1414,One butt muscle is getting bigger,"I'm 20 yrs old and been working out, doing leg and butt workouts. I'm seeing great results on my left buttcheek, it's getting bigger, with more muscle and its firm. on the other hand, my right buttcheek seems to be growing very slow, its growing, but im seeing very slow results. I've been doing squats and lunges, also I've been researching and some people said to do single butt workouts on my weaker (right) buttcheek, but another person said not to do single butt workouts because i'll only burn the fat off and my left (muscled) buttcheek will stay bigger with the muscle I've gained and fat I have on it. I can't seem to find answers because most (or all) questions and answered questions I find, only discuss about imbalanced fat and no one seems to have this problem, I, on the other hand am having imbalanced muscle trouble. What should I do? just leave it? A friend suggested I try burn the fat off my left (muscled) butt, but I'm scared the muscle will only get bigger. any answers?  "
1415,What changes between the 5 rep range and the 10 rep range?,"Through observation and empirical evidence, a lot of strength trainers and bodybuilders have found that 5-6 reps is ideal for building strength, while 10-12 reps is ideal for building size.  I've noticed in my own experience that it's a lot easier for me to add 10lbs to a lift at the 5 rep range, than it is for me to keep the weight for my previous 5RM and go up to 8 or 10 reps.   An obvious answer might be that increasing the reps significantly increases the total load (8 reps at 100lbs is 800lbs total, while 5 reps at 110lbs is 550lbs total), but I'm wondering if there's also something else. Football players are tested for the 40 yard dash because that's about the distance that can be maintained at top speed, around the 5-7 second range, while a 100 meter sprint would have even the best sprinters slowing down slightly at the finish compared to their top speed at any point on the stretch.  Is there something similar going on with lifts? Such as muscle glycogen stores being exhausted in the 5-6 rep range, and the body having to switch to breaking down lactate for energy in the 10-12 rep range? "
1416,Skateboarding After Thirty,"I'm a 33 year old male that has recently taken up skateboarding for the physical and mental health benefits.    For the first few weeks I became cardiovascularly and respitorially fatigued before becoming fatigued in my muscles and frame.  After a month or so, my cardiovascular and respiratory stamina has greatly increased, and I can often skate until my muscles become weak, and often will because I am having a great time.  After skating I am always very sore.  Mostly this is in my muscles, which is actually somewhat pleasurable as my brain uses the soreness as a motivational tactic (you're getting stronger, better, keep it up!)  I also  sometimes develop soreness in my knees, especially after vigorous sessions.  The knee soreness is not pain.   It does not bother me when I walk, but standing up from a sitting position and crouching into a squat position produce a dull strained feeling in my knees.  I also sometimes feel sore in my ankles, but this is only rarely notiable. All the soreness I described has, so far, always gone away after a day or two.  I'd like to continue this hobby because it is having great benefits, but I do not want to injure myself chronically or acutely.  I'm trying to take progress slowly, I'm careful not to attempt maneuvers am not prepared to learn, and I always wear wrist, elbow, and knee padding.  So, given where I am, my questions are:   Are there any signs here that I am risking injury, long or short term? What strategies can I adopt to better prevent/lower risk of injuring myself? Are stretches before or after a good idea?  If so, what should I be focusing on? Are other exercises a good idea?  If so, which ones will help?  "
1417,Does drinking ice water burn up to 1000 extra calories per day?,"   Possible Duplicate:   Does being cold help lose weight?       I read this comment on a YouTube video showing body builders having breakfast:     Ice water. That's the key. Not just plain water - you gotta put   ice in it. Otherwise your gains in the gym just go kaput. It's the   secret of the pros. Especially during contest prep. Burns an extra   1000 cals a day of pure fat.   Obviously YouTube comments by random people who most of the time are just spewing nonsense is not to be trusted but this one really caught my attention because of the ramifications if it's true. So I rather ask the experts, is there any truth to this and if so why? "
1418,Incline or Flat Bench First? Dumbbell or Barbell First? Why?,"I've been following a weightlifting workout where the chest workout is in this order:        barbell incline chest press   dumbbell incline chest press   barbell flat chest press      I've seen incline before flat in other workouts before so it looks like it is a thing.    But, why is this a thing? Why is flat press not first?  Isn't there more total muscle activation during flat press, so shouldn't you fatigue with that exercise first? Why is dumbbell incline between both barbell presses? Why do I typically not see dumbbell flat bench press in workouts (or is it just me)? Is there a better arrangement than the above and why?   I am training for strength and fat loss. I lift as heavy as I can with continuous progressive overload.  I know I asked a bunch of questions so thoughtful partial answers are cool. Thanks in advance! "
1419,Disavantages of a faster metabolism,"Everywhere I read people talking about how to increase metabolism in order to improve weight loss and fitness. Be it with frequent meals, special foods, developing more muscular mass, etc. Overall people seem to have the idea that is one of the best goals for the human body.  No matter how naive it sounds, I can never stop comparing metabolism with a very old proverb:     'The flame that burns twice as bright burns half as long.' Lao Tzu   Is there any evidence on the effects of an increased metabolism on lifespan, health or wellbeing? Or just any known disadvantage? "
1420,"Strict weight watchers adherence and regular, varied exercise not achieving results","I'm very frustrated by my inability to lose weight.  I'm a 28 year old female and I'm stuck in the overweight range.  Despite years of consistent and steady weight watchers and exercise, I cannot break it!  I was 10-15 lbs heavier at times, but I've hit a plateau in my efforts for six months now.  Worse, ANY indulgence has immediate consequences.    I usually prepare my own meals - low fat, low sodium, fresh vegetables, fish.  I eat small quantities which I measure and tally in weight watchers.  I exercise several times a week - spinning, running, Jillian's workout videos.  I have goals which I feel I deserve to reach.  Of course, it's frustrating to see other people with apparently different body chemistry eating terribly, exercising never, all without consequence.  The hard solution, I guess, is to continue to reduce my intake and increase my exercise, but I feel that I'm behaviorally a very healthy already.  Further, any deviation from my aggressive plan puts the weight right back on, pound for pound.  Does my body need to be heavier than other bodies?  Is that just what I'm stuck with?  Are there certain nutritional components I need to avoid besides the standard fat, sugar, carbs that might be keeping me fat?    I guess I'd just like to hear from qualified nutritionists or individuals like me who have learned any tricks to resetting their body's preferred weight.  Thanks! "
1421,How exactly to do mind-muscle connection?,"I've heard about the mind-muscle connection a lot but I just can't seem to understand it enough to get it to work. I get that you are supposed to mentally focus on the muscle, but I don't really feel any difference. For example, I have a hard time feeling pull-ups in my back and trying to focus on my lats while I am pulling up doesn't really activate them. Are there any specific techniques that would increase this connection? And what about compound exercises like the back squat, what muscle(s) should I be focusing on then? "
1422,How do I avoid calf and knee pain after a weekend of tennis?,"I play tennis on hard courts usually 1 - 3 times per week.  Several times a year there are weekend tournaments or other competitive weekend events that I like to participate in.  Typically, by the end of the one of these weekends my calves and/or knees are so sore I have a lot of trouble reacting to the ball.  It goes away after a few days though and doesn't bother me on daily basis. Is this normal?  Are there exercises I can do to prepare myself better for these weekends? "
1423,Define the upper abs only workouts-low body fat,"I want to define the upper abs, I am interested only in workout programs.  My food intake is ok but I do not think I am doing proper a workout; I don't have much bodyfat and I want to focus only on this specific area.  Where should I start?  I have seen internet a lot but I can't say I am impressed about those.  Could you tell me which workouts will help to show the upper abs? "
1424,Is increasing lung capacity a misnomer?,"I have been under the impression that one cannot increase their total lung capacity, it's like the ratio of fast twitch to slow twitch fibers in your muscles, i.e. it is what you were born with. However, I was looking through research articles to confirm this, and I cannot find any articles that specifically address increasing total lung capacity.  I am aware that there are lung training devices out there that purport to increase capacity, but what they really do is train inspiratory muscle, and that neovascularization (increase in capillary and blood vessel counts to exercising muscle) also contributes to O2 delivery and increased O2 utilization.  Can anyone provide some studies directly addressing the increase in lung capacity and the effects on athletes thereof? I am aware of the studies in asthmatics, but they are not increasing the TOTAL lung capacity, they are increasing the FUNCTIONAL lung capacity. I am interested in ones where total lung capacity was shown to have increased.  Edited to clear up - What I'm looking for is any studies where the actual physical lung size has been shown to be increased. Lung volume is directly measured (spirometry, etc), but lung capacity by necessity is a finite value. I'm interested in finding out if there have been any exercises or other interventions that have proven to increase the lung size rather than the efficiency in which we use it? "
1425,Will wearing ankle weights all day long make any difference?,"If I wore them when I'm not exercising, like if I wore them at work (I work in an office), or at home, all day, would it be like a passive form of exercise?  To estimate how much I walk: I guess I walk to the bus stop, probably about 100-200 metres. Get off bus, maybe 100 metres. Then I sit around all day. But maybe go and talk to somebody two or three times - average distance maybe 5-10 metres (?). Go to kitchen or toilet maybe three times (i drink a lot of water), so that's probably about 50 metres away? Maybe I'll take the stairs too, that's 5 floors up and down. Probably its barely half a km in total.  Would wearing ankle weights help me get fitter or will it not be enough to make any sort of difference? "
1426,Short Timeframe Health,"I am severely obese - 180cm and 108Kgs for a 21 year old male - approximately 25Kgs above my 'safe' level. Adverse affects are increased tiredness, mood swings, trouble breathing when performing basic tasks and the like.   What I am seeking is a method wherein I can reduce my weight and maintain it with several factors such as:   Short, inconsistent time-frames for ""free time""; Low income, resulting in restricted budget, and supplements;   Obviously diet it key here - I plan on trying to adhere to:   Simple ""Fat Reducing"" shake in the morning (several suppliments such as iron, calcium etc); Standard lunch (around 10:00am - 12:00pm depending on work) consisting of 2 cans of Tuna and rice crackers, plus an ""energy boost"" drink; Dinner will consist of a range of meals pertaining to my budget - usually pasta, chicken and some other miscellaneous items.   The workout scenario is a little askew due to work and life time restrictions. Traditionally I'll go 1 to 3 times for a 4560 minute gym workout. The workout will consist of:   5 minute bike ride, traditionally ending at 2KM+ 5 minute/1K rowing machine; 5 minute bike ride (for a different part of the leg)   Then, I'll work on some machine weights:   3x 10 sets of 84KG lateral 3x 10 sets of 57-64KG ""pulls"" (sorry, I don't know the names of the machines; horizontal and vertical weights)  3x set of 100KG leg press 3x 100KG back press (I do not know the name)    Then there will be re-visits, or new machines depending on the night and how I feel.  The biggest drawbacks:   My inability thus far to stick to a plan; My time restraints with work and personal life; My habit of snacking and drinking   Furthermore, it's seemingly the point that I am undergoing some test for Iron deficiency, sleep apnea and/or thyroid issues.     So with all that said and done, can I please get some pointers on:   Sleep routines that should be abide by; Best exercises hinging off short-time frames; Best practice diet rules and types of diets and, whilst I know personal opinion; Best methods to enforce/support the desire to change - motivation books, apps, quotes you name it.    Not sure if off-topic here, just really want to try and get it underway.   Related Questions     Wanting to lose weight cycling is this enough?

1427,"Correcting rounded shoulders by adjusting sleeping position, arms going numb","I suffer from rounded shoulders and a slightly forward neck due to bad sitting posture and anterior pelvic tilt which has shortened my hip flexors causing my upper back to compensate by hyperkyphosis. I'm trying to correct all of this now and one of the things I want to do is change my sleeping position. Because our muscles tend to adapt to the positions we keep them in, and I often sleep on my sides with my shoulders somewhat rounded, I have decided to start sleeping on my back.  Moreover, rather than keeping my arms by my sides, I wanted to try to keep my arms in the same position they would be in when performing wall slides, which is one of the exercises I learned is good for correcting rounded shoulders (here and here). In the wall slide, the heels, butt, upper back, shoulders, head, elbows, and wrists are all placed against the wall; the arms slide up and down while the trapezius and rhomboids are extended and contracted. (Forward neck is a result of elongated / weak trapezius and rhomboid muscles. Therefore, strengthening them should reverse the elongation.) Moreover, the lower back should be in contact with the wall, which can be achieved by contracting the abdominals. In bed, I achieve this by placing a couple of pillows under my knees, which posteriorly tilts the pelvis and flattens the curvature in the lower back. (Edit: please see my related question here about sleeping with pillows under knees.)  While lying on my bed, I noticed that if I bend my arms 90 degrees at the elbows, palms facing up, with my wrists above my head (as if I'm about to perform a wall slide but lying down on my bed), my left arm starts to go numb after a minute or so, specifically along my bicep, forearm, and part of my wrist and palm along my thumb. I think this is due to poor flexibility and, as a result, poor blood circulation. Moreover, neither of my wrists actually touches the bed (I have to press down or add a weight to get my wrists to lie flat; similarly, when I perform wall slides, I have to press my wrists against the wall since they do not lie against the wall naturally).  I'm wondering if it is okay to sleep like this and whether the numbness is something that will get better with time. Moreover, will placing my arms in the ""wall slide position"" overnight help correct my posture? "
1428,When should I not exercise?,"In relation to eating, when should I not exercise? Or rather, are there times that are better or worse than others to exercise during the day?  For example, is it better or worse to exercise in the morning? If you do it in the morning, should you do it before or after you eat? Should you wait for a while between you eat and exercise? Or at night, is it better or worse to exercise before you go to bed? Is it better or worse to do it before or after supper?  Maybe not the clearest question, but hopefully someone understand what I'm asking about. Basically, during a day, when taking sleeping and eating into account, when is it preferable to exercise or not to exercise? "
1429,HIIT vs steady state: long term health effects,"Most articles nowadays seem to favor High Intensity Interval Training (HIIT) compared to Steady State Cardio (SS), for various reasons like faster fat loss and getting higher levels of cardio fitness in the same time period. Not only that, but exercise retention among individuals has been much better due to shorter durations of HIIT workouts, which is a good thing.  There are even articles which claim that HIIT might improve aerobic capacity and quality of life in people with heart diseases (compared to steady aerobic cardio). Articles which warn against excessive endurance excercise (Potential Adverse Cardiovascular Effects From Excessive Endurance Exercise, Exercise training reduces resting heart rate via downregulation of HCN4) mostly deal with marathon runners and cyclists - although it's not clear whether it's the endurance part that should be emphasized.  On the other hand, some articles note that there is a difference in heart adaptation between HIIT and SS cardio: on one hand there is a Concentric Hypertrophy of the Heart in HIIT (due to anaerobic stresses), vs the Eccentric Hypertrophy of the Heart for SS, which increases the stretch reflex (less energy used per beat). According to Wikipedia, concentric hypertrophy is the less appealing type of hypertrophy, because it increases wall thickness without increasing the chamber radius, which can ""impair filling and lead to diastolic dysfunction"".  (Update) Again, regarding endurance, there is an article which describes an ""U-shape"" distribution of mortality as a function of exercise pace, quantity, and frequency, i.e. a potentially reduced benefits of endurance cardio if taken too far:     Jogging up to 2.5 h per week at a slow or average pace and a frequency of ≤3 times per week was associated with the lowest mortality. Those who jogged >4 h per week, at a fast pace, and >3 times per week appeared to lose many of the longevity benefits noted with less strenuous doses of jogging      In this study, the dose of running that was most favorable for reducing mortality was jogging 1 to 2.4 h per week, with no more than 3 running days per week, at a slow or average pace.     The jogging pace in the image above might be related to HIIT, for example.  So, while everyone agrees that regular exercise improves cardiovascular fitness, lowers resting heart rate and increases longevity on average, it still appears that hypertrophy effects of HIIT might be more problematic in the long term?

1430,Is Abnormal Sweating a physical disorder?,"I am an cyclist. I at least cycle about 30 km everyday. Other than, I love playing basketball. I play at least about an hour everyday. The problem is, when I am doing these, I sweat a lot than other guys. My shirt is completely soaked, when others are hardly sweating . Is this is a disorder? Is it hyperhidrosis? I am hoping I am not suffering from hyperhidrosis, because casually I am fine, no sweats. It just happens during sports or similar activities. "
1431,I can't hold a plank for long - how do I get more effect out of a session?,"I can hold a plank for 20-30 seconds tops, far shorter after I have done some other work. I have a couple of ideas on how to get more volume and effect out of a session:   Hold until holding the perfect form becomes too hard to do, rest 20 seconds, repeat a few times Set timer to maybe 45 seconds, hold until holding the perfect form becomes too hard to do, start again holding the plank after the next beep, repeat a few times Hold 10 seconds, rest 10 seconds, repeat a few times   Of course the actual values for the times will vary. Are there other ways to achieve my goal? Which one should I pick, and why?     Edit to clarify:   My goal is to strengthen my core for health reasons and to be stronger overall. I assume that holding the plank for a short time period = little training effect. So I'm looking for a structured way to get the most effect out of my workout. "
1432,How much does body fat affect body temperature?,"I'm currently about 30 lbs overweight. I'm also generally much warmer than many others around me, and am constantly seeking ways to cool off. I'm already working on slimming down, but I'm wondering - if I lose 30 lbs and reach my target weight, will I be significantly cooler as well? How much difference does fat make in regulating one's body temperature? "
1433,Sleeping with pillows under legs to correct anterior pelvic tilt,"I'm trying to correct my anterior pelvic tilt (APT) which is a result of bad sitting posture / prolonged sitting. Because our body adapts to the positions in which we fix our muscles, and one period during which we tend to keep our muscles in some fixed position for an extended period of time is sleep (assuming at least an hour or two, because people do move in their sleep), I wanted to make sure I was addressing my sleeping posture.  For a long time, I have been sleeping on my side, but recently, I saw a video suggesting that sleeping on one's back is helpful for correcting APT. According to the video, when in this position, it is important to place pillows under one's knees to allow the pelvis to posteriorly tilt which will relieve the feeling of tightness in the lower back due to extension of the lumbar spine. This tightness / extension without pillows beneath the knees is a result of shortening of the iliopsoas, which is shortened in people with APT.  I'm confused because if the iliopsoas is shortened, then, to correct the resultant APT, wouldn't we want to stretch the iliopsoas and hip flexors as shown here (and up to 30 seconds before the start of the link)? And since sleeping with a pillow under the knees causes shortening of the iliopsoas, wouldn't this exacerbate the tilt? "
1434,How Much Protein Do I Need To Build Mass?,"I am a female. 113 pounds. I am going to start working out because I want my butt to get bigger. I have whey protein. These are the questions I have:   How much protein do I need overall in order to gain mass/muscle in my butt? What types of food should I eat?  If I make a protein shake, how much protein should it have?  What do I need to do/eat before a workout? Should I drink a protein shake before or after my workout?    Thank you. Any advice would be appreciated.  "
1435,Short + Frequent or Long + Rare swims?,"I go to the pool nearly everyday, and I swim laps (25y lengths, 50y laps). I noticed that swimming 10-12 laps (250-300y) doesn't really tire me out, so I can do it daily. But, swimming a mile (33 laps, 1650y) does tire me out, so much so that I need to rest for a couple days (1-2). The two patterns (~11/day and ~33/ 3 days) have the same daily lap average. Which is better for me? 11 laps per day, or 33 laps one day with a 2 day break?  My guess was (Because it takes about 3-4 days for the microtears in muscles to rebuild) that the 33 laps is better than the 11.  "
1436,How does the handstand compare to the plank for abdominal training?,"As part of a body weight circuit, I have been using the plank as the abdominal component. Additionally, I have been working on doing handstands, in preparation for doing handstand push ups.   How well does a handstand compare to the plank for an abdominal workout?  Can I replace the plank with the handstand?   Currently I am doing wall-assisted handstands, but I will progress to free-standing. "
1437,Does jumping a rope in the anaerobic zone build muscle?,My teacher says that we build muscle and increase our anaerobic fitness in the anaerobic zone(that's 80%-90%) of heart rate.  Is this true? Can jumping the rope at say 90% of Max HR build muscle? 
1438,How to choose the best type of vegan protein to take?,"I am man! I have been running and I would like to add to my diet some protein bars or powder [vegetable] protein.  Since I am intolerant to milk and I can only consider the vegan ones.  However, I have realized that some of them contains soy protein (is it bad?) and a large amount of sodium? 1) Should I avoid these ones? Or soy protein is ok? 2) How about sodium? What is an acceptable amount of sodium?  3) The one presented below is acceptable?    4) What are the best proteins for the ones that cannot drink milk? "
1439,"Is it better to engage or relax your ""core"" during long distance running?","I'm currently in marathon training mode and trying to improve my running form and speed in a number of ways. Mostly by trial and error. At the moment, I'm running between 5 and 14km in training sessions, but my long runs are going to get longer as the marathon gets nearer.  The issue I'm focused on at the moment is what to do with my ""core"" (or abdominal girdle) during long runs.  I've started using a slight lean forward at the shoulders to helps improve my speed. However, this changes how my body is positioned during the run and I'm not sure how to best work with this change.  I've taken to actively trying to engage or brace my abdominals (mostly the rectus abdominis) - imagine the feeling when you are at the top motion of a crunch, held for long periods and thats what I've been doing. Its worked of sorts, as I've noticed that occasionally after runs I get DOMS in my Abs. However, I'm not sure if its helping or hindering my running.  Does engaging like this pull blood away from other more vital areas during a run, such as the legs? Alternatively, does it help brace the spine to reduce back fatigue?  Basically, is it good or bad in the long run to brace the core during long runs? (Pun). "
1440,Gastric Bypass Surgery and Creatine/HMB,"I have had gastric bypass WLS earlier in the year, and now with the surgeon's encouragement, I have started weight training to preserve lean body mass. It's going well so far, and after two months, I'm about to move away from the weight machine circuit to the free-weight room. I've been reading about HMB and Creatine, and believe they can help me in my goal to preserve (or even gain!) lean mass in the form of muscle.  What is the best way to take creatine for someone without a full-size stomach? I can't gulp down a lot of fluid all at once, so the powder is tricky, and I'm concerned the capsules won't digest properly. This is also my concern with HMB - can someone with WLS digest the capsules properly?  Also, I can't handle a lot of sugar - fruit juice and other sweets causes temporary but severe side effects (dizziness, nausea, intestinal distress, elevated BP, etc) plus it undermines my weight loss and needed lifestyle change to keep it off. I can and do eat fresh fruit and unsweetened applesauce daily. Is that enough take creatine effectively? "
1441,How can an overweight engineer get back in shape?,"One year later - if anyone sees this note, just to say thanks. I now have 10% body fat, 85kg (started at 130!), and I run demi-marathons.  After reading a vast quantity of books and papers (about 60 monographs) the solution for me was the 1967 book W. Lutz, ""Leben Ohne Brot"".  I personally found everything else rather confused and unscientific. I hope it helps someone.  I just wanted to thank you all for being the inspiration in the earliest days. Very best!    At the worthwhile suggestion of many experts, I have made my question much more consice, and focussed on the question I really am interested in!  I am 46 yrs male, 6', good general health, but have FAT - basically a great big ""beer gut"".  FTR I was the chubby kid in primary school, and then from 14 to 35 very skinny, and now, FAT! Diet: fortunately I eat only home-made food (meats, vegetables, fruits). I eat no sweets. We (thank God) eat no fast food or processed food of any type. I do not drink beer or liquor (but lots of wine).  I generally love exercise, and very fortunately have total commitment-ability, and understand results take a long time. For years I have had no time, or not made the time.  My basic question:  Starting now, I plan to exercise for perhaps 30 minutes a day, every day.  (Unless someone tells me that's wrong and I should do more/less/who knows?)  My essential question:  option A I will basically ""walk fast and hard"" for my 45 minutes. (I am not really able to run at this point, my knees are gettin' old. I enjoy hiking long distances, although do it only once a month presently.)  option B Instead of Walking Hard for 45 mins a day, I will buy some sort of fancy machine (perhaps an elliptical, or the like? you're the experts) and use that for 45 mins a day from here on in.  Why?  Could the machine be plain more efficient to do that?  (Rather than just walking hard?)  ie, you burn more calories (or whatever - you tell me!) on a fancy machine (elliptical? rowing? x-skiing? stationary bike?) compared to plain old Mark1 walking?  if so (if the machine is more efficient), it would seem to be sensible to do that, as it would essentially save time, and get ""more exercise"" (aerobic, heart, whatever - I don't know) per year. (There's also an edge of plain efficiency working out right in your house - no travel/prep time, etc.)  Again - another way to phrase this, is walking (hard) worth anything?  If you are planning to exercise 45 mins a day for the future? Or is it just plain silly compared to some posh machine?  The posh machine will burn much more, tone you better up top .. or no?  So should I go with option A or option B .... ??!  That's the shorter version - THANKS !!!!!!    JonJon - here you go!   "

1443,Accessories for Squat day on Wendler 5/3/1,"I'm working my way through Wendler 5/3/1 (i'm on the second cycle).  After my main lifts I do accessories, 5 sets of 10 for each exercise as per BoringButBig.   There is the option in the program of doing complimentary compound lifts (Deadlifts with Squats in same workout) but I don't want to do that for lots of reasons.   I recover fast during my workouts and enjoy spending time at the gym, hence the large amount of volume in accessories.  My goal is strength (eventually the 1000lb club, currently at 770lbs).  QUESTION: What accessories are best for squat day on Wendler 5/3/1?  Bonus: Out of my routine below, what accessory exercises should I be including that I don't already?  Current workout plan:   Deadlift - 1RM 135kg   Romanian Deadlift    T-Bar Row (alternating horizontal and ez-grip) Iso-Lateral Pulldown Wide Grip Pull-ups  Bench - 1RM 85kg   Incline Bench (DB/BB alternating) Dips Cable Fly (high/low)  Overhead Press - 1RM 55kg   Oly lifts (clean, jerk, push press, powercleans, etc.) Lat DB Raises Face Pulls  Squat - 1RM 130kg   Leg press Leg curl Calf isolation   - Front Squat? ... (not leg extensions)    (I do some ab isolation daily in the form of weighted planks/wheel-outs.) "
1444,Effective warm-up before weight lifting circuit,What's the most effective warm-up before doing my weight lifting circuit?  Is it better to warm up by doing 10 minutes on the elliptical cross-trainer or by doing a set using a light weight before working with your training weight? 
1445,Dips and pushups in the same week?,"My routine on triceps and chest workout, as of now, is: every first week — pushups twice and dips once; every other week — vice versa.   I can't do dips and pushups in the same day, so basically, that is three days in a week working on my triceps and chest. Is this too much work for these muscles? Should I start doing both pushups and dips only once a week? "
1446,Growth hormone and training at night,"Given this: [website]and specifically the graphic there, is it theoretically possible that training hard / eg lifting intensely, at night takes advantage of peak GH periods...?

I don't want to overtrain running, since I've got some lingering trochanteric bursitis in my right hip.  So I was thinking I'd do some rest-day cross training. I'm a cycling enthusiast, but I haven't ridden much yet this year as I've been focusing on running. Would a 15-20 mile (about an hour) bike ride on my non-running days be harmful? Or would it be a good way to stay loose and keep working on my lung capacity? "

For example curling a barbell up as fast as possible then letting it drop down fast is supposed to strengthen the elbow, right or does it only work for the knee?  "
1451,Minimum Effective Dose of Exercise for Cognitive Enhancement,"Given the exercise goal of enhancing cognitive function (higher energy levels, better memory and/or better reasoning skills), what is the Minimum Effective Dose of exercise required for a young adult (ages 20-35)? As in, what is the minimum amount of time spent exercising (with no constraints on spacing, types {cardio vs strength} or intensity) per week that has the maximum amount of cognitive benefits?  Notes:   I am using the term Minimum Effective Dose to mean ""the point of maximum benefit and minimal cost"", as taken from ""The 4 Hour Body"". ""Is there such a thing as a minimum amount of exercise per week?"" addressed the idea of a general minimum of exercise, but it seemed to only target general health. This article (mentions a U-shaped curve) and this product seem to insinuate that there is a specific exercise regimen for cognitive enhancement, but they're not very convincing.  "
1452,How to prevent swimming goggles from fogging,"Hopefully there are some avid swimmers on this exchange that can help me out here.  I recently have taken up swimming as an exercise since my gym has a great pool.  However, I have noticed that my goggles will fog up almost immediately.  Within the duration of one lap across the pool I cannot see anything at all.  What is the secret to keeping clear goggles?  Is it the fit?  The type? The brand? Are some goggles so good that they just resist fogging? "
1453,do low oxygen levels effect fat burn and/or muscle strengthening?,"My goal is to lose 8-pds. I currently weigh 172-pds. Using the following workout and a protein diet, I've lost 10-pds so far starting from Aug-1. Ultimately, I want to do long-distance running, and so need to be lighter. anyway...  my main work-out (4-times / week): (-) free-style with breathing every 3rd stroke. (-) swim non-stop, breathing every 3rd stroke, for 15-min. (-) get out of the pool, drink some gatorade, rest for 5-min. (-) swim non-stop, breathing every 3rd stroke, for 15-min. (-) done.    I breath to put oxygen into my blood. My body then creates energy by combining that oxygen with hydrocarbons that I ate and stored as fat. The process of oxidation releases carbon-dioxide in my breath and heat energy. The hydrocarbon ""burn"" is inefficient, leaving some ""un-burned"" hydrocarbons behind as solid waste. (I think that's correct?)    I can breath each 3rd stroke indefinitely, and I prefer that style just because it's a fun challenge. But I'll obviously have more oxygen in my blood if I breath every 2nd stroke. More oxygen will surely help the oxidation process. Therefore, would breathing more frequently allow me to more efficiently burn fat while I am swimming?  (1) Would breathing every 2nd stroke accelerate weight loss? (2) Might breathing every 2nd stroke help muscle strengthening? why? "
1454,How can an ex smoker stop snacking so much?,"I used to smoke heavily (over a pack a day). A little over a year ago when my girlfriend got pregnant I quit cold turkey. I have since replaced smoking with snacking, and since then gained about 30 lbs.   I want to stop gaining weight and possibly even loose some. I am not very active either, I work on a computer all day and don't do much activity at night. I am not lazy, theres just really nothing to do in this small town and taking care of the new baby takes up a lot of our time as well.

1456,Is taking protein shakes without exercising beneficial or dangerous?,"My 25 year old brother joined a gym two months ago. He does one hour of exercise when he goes to gym. Due to excessive office work, he can't go to the gym regularly. He takes daily, 30 gram protein shakes.  If he doesn't go to gym for a whole week, but continues to take protein shakes, is it beneficial?  Or, is it dangerous to take protein shakes while not going to the gym regularly?  I know that after a workout there are two to three days of recovery. I think that there is no need for protein shakes after that recovery period.  If he doesn't go to the gym and continues to take protein shakes, is there a chance that it will be converted into fat? Or is it not converted into fat because it is not fat? "

Or is 4 weeks on and 4 weeks off better? "
1460,"Muscles fibres, hypertrophy and energy systems","I've asked a few questions on this site about, and have been doing some reading, on:   muscle fibre types (slow twich and fast twitch) hypertrophy (myofibrillar and sarcoplasmic) energy systems (ATP-PC, anaerobic and aerobic)   and I was hoping someone could tell me how the three interlink.  Are the following statements correct?   As more muscle fibres are recruited (starting with slow-twitch and then progressing to fast-twitch), the energy systems used go from aerobic through to ATP-PC. Myofibrillar hypertrophy is an adaptation that allows for greater maximal strength output whereas sarcoplasmic hypertrophy is an adaptation for more prolonged exercise of the muscle.   Can the two different forms of hypertrophy occur in both muscle fibre types?  It would seem to me as though sarcoplasmic hypertrophy predominately occurs in slow-twitch and myofibrillar only occurs in fast twitch but I know that bodybuilders aim for sarcoplasmic in fast-twitch since slow-twitch cannot get very big. "
1461,Is there any benefit to make a pause at the maximum of the contraction?,"For any exercise AND for hypertrophy and/or nervous system, is there any benefit to make a pause at the maximum of the contraction ?  Consider my training.     I use weights that hurt me at 40 sec. Then, I rest-pause for 15 sec. Then, I use the same weights for 20 sec.  I contract during 0.5 sec, then I hold at maximum of the contraction during 1.5 sec, then I stretch during 0.5 sec, finally I ""hold"" during 0.5 sec at maximum of the stretch (i.e. : I don't make pause at this max).      This is done for any exercise and for each of my 3 work series (I don't speak about my warm-up series). The weights are such that the targeted muscle is always well worked and my posture is good (these both constraints are prioritary over all - if there is any problem, the weights must be decreased). Each of these 3 series for a given exercise is in superset with another serie of another exercise (i.e. : antagonist movements/muscles).    40 sec + 20 sec = 1 min, so the time under tension is 1 min, realized with a great load (because it hurts me from 40 sec). These both constraints imply a great mechanical stress. From 40 sec, my weights hurt me and I use supersets : it implies a great hormonal stress. Obviously, I have congestion : metabolic stress   Finally, my training is extremely complete. But within my 40 sec and within my 20 sec of work, I realized that doing pauses at the maximum of the contraction (I'm used to do it - NOTE that I'm not speaking about my rest-pauses !) impede me from doing [5 ; 7] repetitions. If I don't do any pause (not speaking about rest-pauses !) these [5 ; 7] repetitions are done without great difficulty (i.e. : without hurt).  Thus, stopping from doing pauses at the maximum of the contraction implies a possible augmentation of the weights, since the used ones don't hurt me anymore. Otherwise, I would exceed my time under tension of 1 min and that's not good (i.e. : I don't want to use the energy chain of slow fibres).  My question  Would you recommend me to stop doing pauses at the maximum of the contraction (NOTE that I'm not speaking about my rest-pauses !) in order to allow me to augment my weights ?  In other words : is there any benefit to make a pause at the maximum of the contraction that would deencourages me from stoping such a pause ?  This benefit could be on hypertrophy or nervous system.  Would you recommend me a periodization of that, i.e. : doing pauses at maximum of the contraction on Monday for an exercise A, and not on Thursday for this exercise A ? "
1462,How can I adapt my running technique to accommodate pushing a stroller?,"Since having children, I have taken up running because I can push them along. Sometimes I push one kid in a running stroller, other times I push two kids in a small-wheeled stroller that offers much more resistance. I have been reading and developing the ChiRunning technique, which provides fairly detailed instructions about movement.  How can I adapt my running technique (ChiRunning specifically, or running technique in general) to accommodate pushing a stroller?  Some specific problems / questions that I am 'running' into:   One aspect of this method is to lean forward and use the constant state of falling for forward momentum. Does the backward resistance provided by the stroller mean that I should lean forward more/less/the same at a given speed? What should I do with my arms and how close should my hands be to my body - there is the tendency for me to run into the stroller, but I can also keep it ahead of me with my elbows at 90 degrees and forearm perpendicular to the ground? Is there any way in which I can benefit from using the stroller, for example by using the backward resistance to help me develop proper posture while leaning?    "

1466,How long would the training plan from this answer take to get to the level wanted in the question?,"Assuming an average woman... a.k.a  NOT already strong or very much in-shape for their chosen sport... And following the following training plan:     First, get strong with a simple beginner barbell strength program.      The foundation of the routine would be the big compound lifts: squats, deadlifts, presses (bench and overhead), pull-ups, rows, dips, snatches, power cleans, clean and jerks.      To that list of fundamentals, add farmer's walks as a buttress for the squats and deadlifts in developing a strong posture against heavy loads.      Use Barbells for getting strong, with dumbbells a close second. Kettlebells work well for combining strength with conditioning, but they don't provide the really heavy stimulus that makes squats and deadlifts maximally productive.      After strength      Once she's strong enough, she focuses on power and sport-specific strength. She has already incorporated power work in the form of power cleans quite early in training. Now she prioritizes more power exercises because she has a strength baseline.      Her program for a moderate medium-term set of strength goals would roughly look like a double bodyweight deadlift, squatting bodyweight ten times with ease, a dozen strict pull-ups, a bodyweight power clean, and so on.      Sword-fighting-specific work, may involve rotational work, farmer's walks, more sprints, snatches and jerks for power development, barbell complexes or 20-rep squats for strength-endurance, unilateral work like lunges and pistols, gymnastic feats... she would benefit from being capable across a range of strength movements, so once she is strong, she may cycle through variations of basic movements in order to become familiar with a wide range of athletic movements. For example, cycling between back squats, front squats, loaded pistol squats, and Bulgarian split squats.      For both speed, conditioning, and power, she would do sprints and interval running. For power--which also benefits speed--she does the power variants of the Olympic lifts: power cleans, power snatches, jerks.      As it may be hard to challenge her conditioning during skill work, she may incorporate conditioning in addition to sparring, or perhaps she may get plenty of conditioning just from rolling.      If that was the case, perhaps because of a surfeit of technique work instead of sparring, then she may perform something from this cornucopia of conditioning options that is too numerous to fully list.      For example: cycle through a moderate variety of power-biased conditioning workouts (such as kettlebelling, tire flips, sandbag complexes, Prowler pushes, and sled drags) and occasionally return to benchmark workouts (e.g., ""how many 24kg kettlebell clean-and-jerks can I do in ten minutes?"") to gauge progress.   The Question:  How long would it take ON AVERAGE to get to the point so that she can:  Fight while wearing really heavy armour. The helm itself can weigh up to 2kg, the mail can weigh up to 12kg. Add the gambeson and plates and you end up with around 20-30kg.  And have the anaerobic capacity to do 1 minute of really intensive swordfighting with a single handed sword weigh around 1.2kg.  Plus have superb control over her blade at all times.  With the strength to knock another armored knight to the ground.  Assuming that she is devoted to being that good.

1469,How and why should I use walking breaks for running long distances?,"I'm facing a long run, an ultra, that I'm pretty sure I can't do without walking. I can and will try to practice doing it at least once, but I don't really know how to best use walking breaks or how they work.  What strategy works?  And why does it work? Does it help control overheating? Maybe helps remove waste from the muscles? Allows time to burn more fat? I know I'm reaching here.  ------After ultra run-------------------  I didnt practice any run/walk methods, and let my weekly mileage drop to 20-30 3 weeks too early. I used Galloway's 5 minute run to 30 second walk ratio and kept in mind how it changed (referring to his book) for slower paces. Previous 50k runs last year always resulted in a slow shuffle at about 12 min/mile, but in this 46 mile run I was at 11 min/mile up to 36 miles. The run/walk helped finish the ultra. I'm still no closer to understanding this really, and if asked to run another half mile at the end I might have quit. 100 miles still feels impossible.  Other runners had different methods and results. Many who ran faster ended up spending a lot of time at aid stations and fell way behind. One speedy lady ran the first 20 miles then did a run/walk of 8 min/ 2 min, or at least that was her planned before she disappeared down the trail. Inspiring to watch. The winner according to his Strava data ran much if not all of the course at an unbelievable pace. Most people seemed to shun walking as much as they shunned running fast which was anything faster than 10 min/mile in the first few miles.  Still digesting the one answer here, but maybe the answer is in there.  No way can I do 100 miles sucessfuly the first time without understanding this first, but maybe failure is worth the lessons learned... "

1471,What can cause severe muscle fatigue and even pain at wake-up?,"When I wake-up (i.e. hear the alarm clock and open my eyes) I experience severe muscle fatigue, that I am hardly able to force myself to move my arms and legs to get-up. I feel like my muscles were extremely weak at that moment, and I also feel pain in them. It feels so bad and weak, that half of the time I am not getting out of bed, and sleep another few hours, although I already had enough sleep, and it doesn't feel any better after the extra sleep - in fact it feels worse.  When I do finally manage to get out of bed, the muscle fatigue and pain magically goes away after 15-30 minutes, and during the day I feel completely normal, full of energy and fine.  It doesn't matter if its after a 2-hour nap or a long 8-hour sleep, its the same fatigue. And I am not feeling sleepy, drowsy or anything like that, I just feel my muscles are extremely weak. I am skinny, 60 kg, but slowly gaining weight, in fact I am tracking my food intake and making sure I get at least 2850 kcal each day, so I have enough energy source. And during the day I am not feeling the fatigue or energy-less, its just right after wake-up.  What might be the cause of this?    EDIT: more info:  I measured my blood pressure immediately after wake-up. It was 77/37 mmHg. And that is an average of 10 measurements taken in the 10 minutes after wake-up. That's somehow low, isn't it?  Not that my blood pressure normally during the day is too good, it is on average something around: 95/62 mmHg. After riding on bicycle for an hour it is about 103/64 mmHg.  Can that have something to do with my wake-up fatigue? What can I do to get my blood pressure to some normal levels? "
1472,Does running a few miles daily makes you lose musculature?,"I have seen various bodybuilding sites claim that running releases cortisol which 'eats' away muscles.  Is this true?

Not talking about a marathon or any long distance event, but 2-3 miles a day.(I know running long distance events reduce your musculature)  Would it make me lose muscles?  But, Navy Seals do incorporate running a few miles daily in their schedules so there must be some benefits. "
1473,Does cardio burn fat differently than burning calories though non-cardio workouts?,"I have read over and over again that you can't target specific areas to lose fat in.  Also we know that if we burn more calories than we consume, we lose weight.  My question is then:  Does it make a difference how you burn the calories?  Many ""get 6-pack abs"" sites talk about the need for cardio.  But if I burn 200 calories running or 200 calories walking, don't I burn the same amount of fat?  If so, does it somehow burn ""differently""?  If not, from a pure weight and fat-loss standpoint, is there any benefit to cardio? "
1474,What is the effect of spreading a workout over a day?,"Suppose I have a gym routine that I want to fulfil, with the goal of strengthening a particular set of muscles. (I don't care about increasing bulk or definition at all).  The current plan is gym sessions that are 3 sets of 10 reps on each of a couple of excercises that work those muscles. Done in an ABC_ABC_ABC pattern. The sessions take me ~30-45 minutes and get me moderately sweaty, and I'm gradually increasing the load on all the excercises.  Currently my biggest problem is actually DOING the session - I put them off and skip them :(  One way that I think would make it easier for me to actually do them would be to split the excercise up. Say first thing in the morning I do just the first set, or the first block of set, then a few hours later I do another set/block, then I do my last set/block at the end of the day.  I think that I will be more likely to succesfully DO that routine.  What would be the effect of that change? Does doing the excercises all together make a difference? Or does it not matter when I do stuff as long as I do the whole routine by the end of the day?    Context which may or may not be relevant?  I am specifically trying to fully recover an on-going hamstring injury. I have twice recovered to the point where I had no pain or range issues, including being able to train and sprint fully, and then during the first or second 100% pace match have re-pulled the hamstring.  Specific excerices are a combination of Double leg RDLs (X kg), Double-leg Good Mornings (X kg), Single-leg RDLs (~60% of X kg), Side leg raises, Side planks.  I have a small work gym, hence it is plausible to just walk in, do a set and walk back out "
1475,"To what extent is someone who does ""powerlifting"" a ""powerlifter""?","I do work out for strength, but I am not a professional powerlifter. Does that mean I have the right to, and expect a respectable position so forth, to be coining/coined as a powerlifter if I just do powerlifting exercises?  Should I reach some standard in achievements within powerlifting, like one reaching a desired goal, or enter a competition, i.e. and then I'll be labeled as a ""bonafide"" powerlifter? I mean I do the exercises, but I do not compete as of now, and I'm not quite strong either.   But is someone who writes and has gotten paid for writing a writer, despite having no degree?  Many filmmakers write scripts and did not go to college, but are respected and coined as writers. I want to know at what degree I can be coined as powerlifter.  I mean I can consider myself anything I want, but I want other people to respect it as well, and take me seriously. "
1476,Which stretches should one do every day to reverse efects of sitting at work?,"I follow the starting strength weight training program. One thing I like about it is that it consists of few (4) but effective exercises. In general there seems to be some sort of consensus as to which weightlifting exercises are the most important. Several other programs use the same 4 exercises (squat, deadlift, bench press and overhead press).   In addition I want to do some stretching every day to revert the effects of sitting at work. Searching the web I find a huge variety of suggested stretches. This is a bit of a problem.  Like in weightlifting I am looking for the minimum number of stretches with the maximum effect.    What I have found so far are the following:   The founder exercise: [website]combines stretching of hamstring with static strengthening of lower back. Yoga squat: [website]Shoulder opener: [website]"
1477,Specific form of pull up technique question,I'm on progression of doing a muscle up and currently on the level of doing the following pull up exercise [website]
1478,Endurance activities and carbohydrates: when are they needed,"Generally, I keep my carbohydrates low, less than 100 grams a day if I can. I do a fair amount of running and strength training. I participate in regional amateur competitions for the same.   I'll be doing a multi-week backpacking trip, involving roughly ~15 miles a day of trail hiking. Lots of altitude gain/loss, and carrying a ~40 pound pack. In the backpacking and hiking world, protein is treated as a nice-to-have second class citizen, and carbohydrates are much lauded for their easy energy. Everything is noodles, rice, flour, and other pulverized carbs.  Anecdotally I ""know"" that distance runners need a lot of carbs and I'd imagine that ~6 hours a day of strenuous backpacking is in the same ballpark. Specifically though my question is:  Are there established guidelines for when a fitness activity requires significant carbohydrates in the diet beyond what can be provided via ketosis?   I don't mind eating carbs for two weeks if necessary, but I'd like to understand why they're necessary beyond just the folk wisdom of ""because you need carbs for energy"". I would imagine Inuit people weren't lounging about all day and managed without the carbs.  Re-asking this a slightly different way, how does someone know that they need to have carbohydrates in their diet in order to maintain a given level of aerobic activity?  "
1479,What is a effect of using green tea with workout?,I am using green tea while workout. I want to know how does it effect for body and health? As I know drink green tea loose weight.Does it makes heart rate high? 
1480,I can't do curl ups without someone holding my feet down?,"I'm 14 years old, and throughout the multiple tests we've had to do in gym, I am never able to do a curl up without automatic form break. My lower back doesn't go up and my arms move causing the form-break. I am also not very athletic, I don't like doing exercise but I can do the average amount of push-ups and pacers, etc. Is it because I don't have core strength? Or because of physics? I'm 4'11 and I weigh 103lbs. Please help!  "
1481,Pyramid training - High to low or low to high,"Why is it better to pyramid up to your max during sets compared to starting out with your max and then slowing bringing down the weight after?  Obviously, this is after stretching and warmup sets (30%-50% of 1RM).  I would assume that it's better to try and reach your max/do your heaviest lifts on fresh muscles rather than trying at the end of your workout?  Example - 3x5 at 80%, 90%, 95% for pyramiding up vs 3x5 95%, 90%, 80%. Percentages are with your One Rep Max (1RM).  I can only think low to high build muscle mass and high to low for aesthetics.   Thanks.  Edit 1 - The question spawns from that I've been plateauing on OHP and starting thinking why I can't break my weight. Once I started thinking of the logic that my arms/shoulders are tired by the time I get to my ORM attempt, it made me ask the question of why not start heavy first. "
1482,Training for Half/Full Marathon on Treadmill,"I am going to be starting to train for either a half or full marathon.  The problem I have is I live in the desert, it's hot...all the time, even in the early mornings it is in the mid-upper 80s to low 90s.  So running outside is not ideal for me. I own a treadmill and I do most of my running on that.   I have read articles about using a treadmill for some of the training but not all of it. Most advise to use an incline of 1-2% to simulate wind resistance.  Are there any specific training plans that could be easily adjusted for treadmill training?    I am concerned that the treadmill won't get me race ready since I will not be training outside. Should I attempt to add some outside runs prior to race day? "
1483,Advice on protein supplements with Kick Boxing / Weight Lifting Training,"What do you think about protein supplements?  I train kick boxing and some weight lifting roughly 2 - 3 times a week.  Would you suggest taking protein supplements?   If so, what would you look for when choosing such protein supplements?  I heard about Maximuscle, have you heard about it?  Any supplements you would suggest?  Thanks! "
1484,Is it theoretically possible to burn fat without any training only based on diet?,"Suppose a person(who doesn't do any sports) changes a diet, so that it has a ""right"" ratio of protein, carbs and fats, and a small carbs deficit. What will happen next? will he lose fat or muscle or both? "
1485,Fitness and ability to do sign language,"I have downloaded some apps illustrating sign language from the Android play store, but I have something remotely related to muscular dystrophy.  Is fitness of the arms and hands and face muscles a prerequisite for doing sign language? What if one cannot due to fatigue, sickle cell anemia, or ano other drug-induced or other tiredness condition?  Thanks.  (Also, why are the [face] and [mouth] tags missing from the list of tag choices)? "
1486,HIT training for strength (bodyweight),"I've been doing a lot of reading over the last few days and I've come across ""HIT: High Intensity Training"".  Now I like the idea of only having to do 1 set (albeit with slow reps) and there seems to be a lot of evidence supporting this method so I think I'm going to try it for myself and test after a month of doing it by going back to my traditional routine to see if I have made any strength gains.  My question is, how do I emphasise strength development in HIT over hypertrophy (bodybuilding)? Do the same rep ranges apply to HIT as with traditional training (i.e. 1-5 reps for strength)?  I recently got an answer on this site to another question I asked where it was said that rep ranges are not important, it is the time under tension that is important: 7-10seconds for strength (because this utilises the ATP-PC energy system). So this would mean that I should do 1 set and only 1 rep to get the right amount of time under tension to develop strength in HIT? Doesn't seem right... "
1487,"How to train, eat and relax in the week before my first marathon","My first marathon is this coming weekend. Many months of training are behind me, and I'm feeling pretty good as the race approaches. But I am a little unsure as to how to prep over the next week. As far as the training goes, I'm taking it easy; the long runs are behind me. But what should I eat? What should I not eat? What other questions should I be asking?   Thanks for your input! -Nathan "
1488,How to protect valuables at gym,"Yesterday, during the 1 hour I was at the gym, someone forced the lock and got into my locker.  When I was done showering I came back to my locker and opened my combination lock as normal, and opened the locker to discover that everything was messed up and rearranged, with my wallet out and on top of my pants.  Luckily, nothing was missing.  (Not even my phone!)  I took a closer look at the Master combination lock and saw that there was significant damages to the outside of it.  Interestingly, whatever tool the thief used to force open the lock, left the lock in a usable state.  They were able to lock it again when they were done rifling through my stuff, and I was able to open the lock with the combination.  So my question for this community is:  what is the best type of lock to use on the lockers in a typical gym?  Clearly the Master combination lock is vulnerable (although the version I had was slightly smaller than a full sized combo lock).  Do the people here use anything in particular to guard against tool-equipped gym thieves? "
1489,What are the benefits of box jumps compared to the stair climber?,"From my research, both exercises - box jump/vertical jump and the stair climber - generally activate the same type of muscle regions (legs as well as core) on top of strengthening the cardiovascular system. Besides box jumps being an explosive movement are there any other additive benefits of box jumping over the stair climber? What are some alternative exercises to these exercises since they both seem to be pretty harsh on the knee joints?  "
1490,Interpreting descriptions of sets,"Many strength training programs describe sets something like this:  3 sets 8-10 reps, 10-12 reps, 13-15 reps  I'm not sure what this actually means. Does it mean, 8-10, 8-10, 8-10 (drop the weight here) then 10-12, 10-12, 10-12 (drop the weight again) 13-15, 13-15, 13-15?  Or does it mean 8-10, 10-12, 13-15 (drop the weight here); 8-10, 10-12, 13-15 (drop the weight again); 8-10, 10-12-13-15  Or does it mean something completely different?  UPDATE:  To clarify, what I want to know is this: Do you do three of the first range, three of the second range, three of the third range OR Do you do three of all three ranges, three of all three ranges, three of all three ranges? (In both scenarios a total of 9 sets will occur) "
1491,How can I transition from obese to Mesomorph?,"I am an obese person and have been working out for about two months now, I’ve been doing 30min cardio and 30 min lifting (usually upper body 3 x 10-12 , 110-130 lbs depending on area).    I know that I could do a better routine to build muscle , but my question is , Is there something wrong with building muscle and transitioning from obese to endomorph body type or should I go from obese to “fit” to endomorph?  If I can transition directly , what exercise do you recommend weightlifting wise?  I started at 410 lbs , this is my current body composition.    "
1492,Exercise ball as a complement,"Since I work from home very long hours (9-12h) every day and do not have to conmute, I force myself to be constantly active.  I do swimming, bike riding and short workouts (30 min) at a gym 2-3 days a week. Normally I finish my workouts doing abs, and since I learned some moves with the exercise ball I only train them directly with the ball now.  Recently I am wondering if getting a ball for home will make a big difference.  One one side I want to replace my chair for a couple of hours, mostly to add some variety to my posture. On the other, I could forget about direct abs training at my gym and add some extra exercise. On the recovery days I could just do just some short-intense abs training separate from other exercises.   Is it worth the idea? Does is sound like a good thing to do? Could I overdo abs or hinder recovery by training that way? I always disregarded the ideas of home training and ball-chair but thinking about the sitting variety and moving off direct abs training from my gym seems quite sound. "
1493,Uneven butt cheeks,"I'm 15 years old and started lifting about 5-6 months ago. I started to lift because I wanted a booty and muscular legs. I have always been skinny so I am set on gaining weight in muscle. My right butt cheek has always been bigger than the left. Since I started lifting, I feel like it has become more noticeable.  I'm not sure if the right is actually bigger or the left is just more lifted. I have read elsewhere that it could also be fat deposits and I have a slightly bigger right breast. Maybe the right side has more fat?  How can I fix it? How long will it take? Also any tips for lifting in general would be great. "
1494,Correct way to track varying exercises,"Tracking an exercise like the squat is easy (seeing as it's one motion), ie: weight [40kg] - sets [3] - reps [6].  But what about an exercise like the biceps curl. They can be done at the same time or one at a time. How would people prefer to track an exercise like that? Either:   arms singularly => weight [14kg] - sets [3] - reps [20] arms together => weight [28kg] - sets [3] - reps [10]   Arms together, gives a total weight of 28kg, but you're still only engaging half of that (14kg) per arm, so I would have thought the first way of tracking (singularly) is the most accurate, thoughts?    I've discovered that a rep in each arm or leg only counts as 1 rep when you have completed both. Simply put, 10 biceps curls with your left arm and 10 with your right, is really just 10, not 20 reps. "
1495,Do you still gain muscle even if you do less reps than last time?,"Today, probably due to having a not very nutritious lunch, I was able to lift noticeably less (e.g. Benching at 55kg rather than 75kg) weight &amp; reps than normal.   In a situation like this, if your muscles at the time don't have sufficient energy, do they still adapt to get stronger, so that the next time you'd be able to lift (probably) more than the 'normal' amount, or will noticeable muscle adaptation not take effect as you aren't hitting their limit due to a lack of energy?  Obviously I know this isn't a good situation to get into, but is it actually worth going through with the full routine if your goal is to just gain mass, and you're not really worried about the lower weight repetition (endurance) range, assuming your supper or whatever is 'good' meaning you get your needed calorie/protein/etc. for the day?  "
1496,Don't Understand Workout Schedule,"Can somebody explain this Men's Health workout plan to me?  I don't understand what this workout is asking me to do (along with the commenters).  More specifically, how am I supposed to know which workouts to do on a given day? "
1497,How many times I should repeat plank?,I am 25 year male. I can hold the plank position for 1 min. How many times should I repeat that? What should be the interval? I am a beginner so please enlighten me with the correct info so that I won't end up in the hospital by overdoing things. 
1498,Hot or cold shower for muscle growth on workout days,"I workout every two days, I mostly do 45 minutes-workouts 'heavy-lifting' oriented (deadlifts, squats, bench press, weighted pull-ups, abs), and, each week, one of these workouts is more cardio-oriented.  I usually take cold showers each days at 7 PM, but I'm working out at 11 AM (or 4 PM for cardio days).  The thing is that I've read that cold and hot showers have various effects, but they are generally considered to be post-workouts. For instance, hot showers are supposed to help to build muscle while cold showers reduce inflamation, so muscle growth, but they reduce cortisol levels (so it improves testosterone level which is needed for muscle growth).  Do cold/hot showers still have an impact on muscle growth hours after a workout? If so, how should I adapt them? (For example: hot showers on workout days, cold showers on rest days) "
1499,Avoiding hernia,"Are there any precautions for avoiding hernia when performing weightlifting? When doing exercises at the preacher curl bench, it feels as if my organs are strained.  Can weightlifting belts aid in this or are they only good for your back?  Update:  It feels like my organs get pushed farther away from their ""rest position"" when performing the exercises stated above. "
1500,Does my routine adversely affect me?,"I am a 15 year old male, and I started exercising about 6 months ago. However I managed to procure a pair of dumbbells at the beginning of April, and have been exercising with them so far. My question is whether my following routine has any adverse effects on me? Also I have read that the abdominals work in converse(?) to the lower back and the back in general. So is there enough lower back work in my routine, as compared to the rest?  I warmup with around 5 minutes of on-the-spot jogging/jumping jacks/jumping rope, and do around of dynamic stretching for all major muscle groups.   Bodyweight shoulder tap pushup x20 / 7.5kg(per arm) dumbbell flies x10 / 7.5kg(per arm) dumbbell bench press x10 Bodyweight pullup x10 / 7.5kg(per arm) dumbbell row Bodyweight bench dips x10 7.5kg(per arm) dumbbell hammer curl x10 7.5kg(per arm) dumbbell squat x10 7.5kg(per arm) dumbbell military press x10 10kg(per arm) dumbbell deadlift x5   I do each of these  exercises in a row without rest, then rest for about 1-2 minutes, then start another such ""superset"". I do 3 of these.   Afterwards, I stretch all my muscle groups for about 30 seconds-1 min per group. And then I start an ab and calf routine that goes like this:   2.5 kg weighted plate crunch x10 Standing calf raise with 7.5kg(per arm) x20 Lying leg raises x10 Standing calf raise with 7.5kg(per arm) x15 1.25 kg weighted plate twist crunch x10 Standing calf raise with 7.5kg(per arm) x10 Plank 30 seconds Standing calf raise with 7.5kg(per arm) x10 5kg russian twist x8(per side)  "
1501,"What muscles are targeted by these different variations of pull-ups: standard, chin-ups, and the neutral or parallel close grip pull-up?","What muscles or muscle groups are targeted by these different variations of pull-ups: 1.) standard (overhanded), 2.) chin-ups (underhanded), and 3.) the neutral or parallel close grip pull-out (thumb is nearest the body - can done in an equipment similar to the 'Iron Gym')? What are the differences in the muscles these pull-up variations target?    Illustrations of the neutral or parallel close grip pull-out:            I also would specifically like to know if the modified chin-up as illustrated above, target different muscles compared to a standard pull-up or a standard chin-up? Or does it target similar muscles to one of the two?  Context and reason for question: I would like to know which pull-up variation targets which muscles, so I could use that variation in my workouts and try to focus on a certain muscle. E.g. If my biceps need work (which I do), then I could choose an optimal pull-up variation to use.  I'm also interested in learning what muscles the neutral or parallel close grip pull-up targets (I don't get good results on either Wikipedia or Google), as it is a pull-up variation that can be done in the equipment I use (similar to the 'Iron Gym' equipment).  "
1502,Significance of dead body pose in yoga,My yoga instructor always asks me to finish off my session with the dead body pose. I understand the need and benefits of a cooling off session but when I'm hard pressed for time I sometimes skip it. Is there anything else that I'm missing? Is there any neurogical or other benefits that I'm missing? 
1503,How can I build a routine based around a power tower?,"Intro:  For a few months, I'm not going to have access to my gym. What I do have access to is:   A power tower a.k.a chin-up/dip station 2 x 8kg dumbbells An ab roller Some push-up handles   When I say ""power tower"", this is the kind of equipment I'm talking about. However, the one I have has two handles where the palms face each other in the middle, with no mid-section to the chin-up bar.    Program plan  Previously the majority of my workouts have been traditionally strength based with barbells and dumbells. While its not what I'm used to a body-weight only (mostly) workout for a few months seems like an interesting challenge.  I am planning on cycling through a 3 day routine, doing a set of exercises on Mon-Wed,  repeating on Thu-Sat and then resting/running on Sunday. For the routine I'm aiming for these kinds of numbers/exercises I'm planning to build up to [reps x sets]:  Back - Mon/Thu:   Wide grip pull-ups - 10 x 3 Pull-ups - 10 x 3 Neutral grip pull-ups - 10 x 3 Bent-over lateral raises - 10x2 + 1 set to failure (targeting posterior deltoid) (Perhaps?)   Chest - Tue/Fri:   Wall supported hand stand push-ups - 8x5 Dips - 10 x 5 Wide hand push-ups - 10 x 3 Lateral raises - 10x2 + 1 set to failure   Legs/Core - Wed/Sat:   Pistol squats - 10 x 3 (per leg) Ab roller - 10 x 3 Hanging oblique crunch - 10x2 (per side) Bird-dog - 10 x 3   Limitations:  I don't come close to some of the rep ranges listed (except for dips). I've never done a handstand in my adult life. I don't have any posterior chain work for hamstrings/glute/lower back. I'd like a little more variety on back day just to keep everything balanced.  Goals:   Maintain or improve muscle mass (especially in the arms and lats) Hypertrophy for abs/oblique/serratus to improve 6-pack  (yes, it's mostly diet but I have that under control) Increase max reps for strict pull-ups Progress to single-armed pull-ups Progress to free-standing handstands and free-standing push-ups    Question:  If I want to maintain or improve my general physique, without degrading my shoulder health or posture, how could I improve this workout plan based on my given limitations? "
1504,Diet for Muscle Building and Fat Loss,"I'm a 5'10"" male at 190 lbs. Some of this must be from muscle, but there is still a significant amount of fat I want to eliminate.  I'm doing StrongLifts 5x5, believing that it will give me the muscle and tone I want.   My previous workouts were endurance-based, but I did experience muscle growth even though I was eating 1900 calories with the occasional cheat meal. I believe that the gradual increase in the weight from the StrongLifts 5x5 method will eventually force my muscle to grow amazingly.   My main concern is fat. I have known for a long time that the human body is either in a catabolic or anabolic state. I now know that it's fruitless to attempt to try to build muscle and lose fat simultaneously. You can't grow muscle without at least maintenance calories, and you can't lose fat without a deficit. Unfortunately, I did not learn this lesson until recently.  This all being said, I really don't want to put on fat. I want to know if there's a way to build muscle on the days where I strength train, and cut fat on the days where I don't.  My TDEE calculates to 2200 (BMR 1800), so in order to gain muscle, I know that I need at least a 500 calorie surplus. I also know that if I want to lose fat, I need a deficit of 500 calories, according to this calculator.  My plan is to be in a calorie surplus on strength training days, and in a deficit on every other day. My question boils down to this: Is it possible for me to lose fat and build muscle by changing my calorie intake based on when I strength train that day?   I really don't want to gain fat in the process of building muscle, but if there's no other way, I just need to know. If I can't lose fat and build muscle simulataneously, I'll focus on building muscle by consuming 2700 calories per day. "
1505,seeking qualified sports medical advice (USA),"This stackexchange site frequently closes questions because people are asking questions that require a qualified medical practitioner.   Recently, I have my own question that I think falls into that category. I've spoken to my general practitioner doctor and it's clear she's not a sports medicine doctor. She would much rather have me tone down my ambition rather than help me push.  Between physical therapists, sports medicine doctors, and whatever else is out there, what should I look for and how should I go about finding a good sports medicine practitioner?    I have my fitness goals, I want to pursue them, and I need a medical practitioner in my corner that has experience with people pushing their bodies hard in a safe way. Will any spots medicine doctor do? Are there things I should ask or look out for? "
1506,Why are there so many exercises in bodybuilder workouts?,"I did Starting Strength for 4 months and saw good results. I've changed to a novice bodybuilder workout, and noticed that the rep/set range has increased from 3x5 to 4x10, which makes sense for hypertrophy gains.  What I don't understand is how and why you need to do so many different exercises per body part..And I've seen this in many bodybuilder routines... E.g. on SS, you only did 15 reps of bench press, but on a typical chest day you might have to do bench, incline bench, flys...   How can you be expected to do flys property, when you have just done so many reps of bench + incline bench? How can you be expected to work your biceps or another small muscle group effectively when you have just complete one isolation exercise? Why do you need to do flys, lateral raises etc when you already do sooo many compound movements such as shoulder presses or bench presses.  "
1507,"Trying to lose as much weight as possible in 7 days. 2 days done, been swimming, what more should I do?","So I wanna lose as much weight as possible in a week's time. I've been swimming 50 laps per day (1 lap = 25m). Is that enough? Or could I do something more? I am currently 5'8"", and weight 87 kg (191 lbs.) at 16 years of age. "
1508,"Eating before a training session - what do you do to be ""light""?","As well as weight lifting, I do some all-round training like running and Quads and Core (okay, the class name is officially ""Legs Bums &amp; Tums""). With these kinds of exercises it helps if you are not weighed down by a big meal you had earlier on the day.  I'd like to have lots of energy, but not have a full bowel if you know what I mean. When should my last big meal be, and what should I be eating to give me energy without becoming weighted down?  UPDATE: How about this. Somebody competing, in running or swimming say, needs to be full of energy but not be full of food (or else they add to their body weight, making them slower). What would they do? Snack on food 24 hours before rather than have big meals? "
1509,Tingling in fingertips and lips on a hard run,"I'm a casual runner who tends to come in mid-pack on a 5K race.  If I really push myself on a 4-mile run, as I get toward the end my heart rate approaches 190 BPM and my fingertips and lips feel tingly.  Is that from lack of oxygen?  Am I getting fit or am I being stupid? "
1510,How important is it that a person be able to touch their toes?,"For as long as I can remember, I've heard the question ""can you touch your toes?"" asked by people trying to ascertain another person's physical fitness. I've grown up thinking that being able to touch your toes was a basic ability that every healthy person should have, and that not being able to do it meant that you were in bad shape.  However, I have actually never been able to touch my toes. If I keep my knees locked and bend over I actually can't get the tips of my fingers much closer than 8 inches to my toes. I've been stretching for over a month now in an attempt to remedy this, but aside from a somewhat unpleasant feeling in my lower back and thighs, my efforts haven't seen much results as of yet. And now I'm starting to ask myself, ""why is this even important?"".  Is it possible that what I thought was common knowledge and/or common sense is completely wrong? Are there people that just can't touch their toes, period, end of story? In short - is it important that I become flexible enough to touch my toes, and if so, why? If this actually is important to my athletic ability and/or physical health, I'll keep at it. But maybe it isn't?  Edit 2011-05-31:  I really appreciate the answers so far, they have been quite informative. However, I'm having a hard time marking any one of them as the official ""accepted"" answer, because I don't see a direct, definitive answer among them. Ivo Flipse's comment seems to me to be the most direct answer, but I'd really appreciate if someone could provide an answer (preferably linked to a authoritative source) that specifically mentions:   If the majority of healthy, active people can touch their toes How to tell if you have the potential to be able to do this. What sort of activities/situations are helped by having this flexibility, or hindered by not having it? If flexibility prevents injuries, what sort of injuries are likely if one doesn't have this flexibility?   Thanks again for everyone's help. If I don't get a better answer in the next few days, I'll accept YYY's answer. "
1511,Just finished 12-week shortcut to size. What's next?,"I have just completed a popular mass building program by Jim Stoppani called ""Shortcut to Size"". I found it to be really well designed. There are subtle variations in exercises that become noticeable over time, and they make total sense.   It took me longer than advertised 12 weeks: I started on December 15 and finished on April 27, which is approximately 18 weeks. I pulled a back muscle in the end of January (lost about 10 days there), took extra days off while traveling, etc. It took me longer, but I finished every workout, every set, and every rep. Nutrition wise, I followed Jim's advice on supplements (ordered bulk from Amazon and mixed my own). As far as food, I cannot possibly eat as much as Jim recommends for this program. It is a terrible thing - to eat when not hungry. It works better for me to wait between meals to start feeling a little bit hungry, and then eat with appetite.  As far as results, I started at 182 lbs and finished around 207. I am 6'3"", so this is not the limit. I would like to bulk up beyond 220 lbs, maybe 230.  I spent some time considering what to do next. I did not find any program  that would seem obviously good, so I started the same program from the beginning. I like it that it is 4 workouts per week, and that there are no exercises that require exotic equipment. I was able to do every exercise (or find a reasonable substitute) in a small gym with some free weights, a Smith machine, and a cable machine. The only problem with that program is that some workouts took me forever to complete. On many days I spent 2 hours and 30 minutes in the gym, and rarely did I spend less than 1 hour and 30 minutes per workout. I really think that 2h30m is excessive. Ideally I would like to keep it to 1 hour, maybe 1h30m. I think a program with supersets might help to keep workout time manageable.  There is another program by Jim, ""Shortcut to Shred"", which it seems most people would start after ""Shortcut to Size"". But I would like to do another round of mass building first.  What's a good program for me to do next? Any other advice for me? I feel like I had a good start, and want to keep the momentum. "
1512,"As long as I do enough exercise, can the effects of junk food intake be offset?","So it's been explained to me that it's basically just a matter of burning more energy than you consume.   So say, in theory, if I were to do heaps and heaps and heaps of exercise every day. But then I was to also eat takeaway for every meal, but the exercise I was doing burnt more calories than the food I was consuming.  Would that be okay? Would that constitute a healthy lifestyle? Are there any negative consequences of eating improperly that can't be negated with exercise? "
1513,How do you find a good personal trainer?,"From time to time people have suggested to me that I see a personal trainer. However, what I've read and also seen firsthand suggests to me that a lot of personal trainers aren't really good at making people fit and/or don't necessarily know what they're supposed to be teaching. Teaching people to do exercises with bad form, routinely working people out until they puke, etc, are things I've seen. Fear that getting bad advice from a trainer would be worse than not seeing one at all has thus far prevented me from seriously looking into this.  So my question is - if I were to see a personal trainer, how could I be sure to find one who really knows their stuff? Is there a special certification beyond the basic license (in the US) that I should look for? Are there certain questions I can ask? Do you even get to interview a trainer before you schedule a session with them? I really have no idea where to even start with this. "
1514,How should you warm up for stronglifts sessions?,"From the StrongLifts book:     Never jump straight into your work weight, warm-up first. As an example, let's say your   work weight for the Squat is 135lbs. Then here's how your training would look like...         2×5 45lbs => 2 sets of 5 reps with the empty Olympic bar   3 x 90lbs => 1 set of 3 reps with the 45lbs bar + 22.5lbs/side   5 x 135lbs => first set of 5 reps with your work weight   5 x 135lbs => 2nd set of 5 reps with your work weight   5 x 135lbs => 3rd set of 5 reps with your work weight   5 x 135lbs => 4th set of 5 reps with your work weight   5 x 135lbs => 5th and final set of 5 reps with your work weight      I'm a complete newb, so wondering if anyone could give me a more general way to warm up. Like, you start with empty bar, then add how much, how many times, until you reach the target? And also, do you do this for just the first squat exercise, or do you warm up similarly for the 2 exercises coming after that as well? And if so, should you start with the empty bar each time? Or?  Just looking for easier, more general rules I can follow as I'm a total beginner and the examples in the book was a bit too specific for me to be able to pull something general from them. "
1515,What diet/excercise plan should I take on this summer?,"I'd like to do a 'Summer transformation' over this summer vacation (I'm sure that's not a new concept). I'm male, 16, 5'9, and 167.5 lbs. I'm not overweight, but I'm got stomach fat, and I'd rather have a 6 pack than 6 pounds (who wouldn't?).   I'm not doing anything in June, so the ability to completely control my amount/type of food consumption and exercise is completely at my disposal. I have pretty much the same amount of time in July, minus a few weeks for vacation. I don't really know how many pounds I should lose, nor am I concerned. I'd just like to rid myself of all the (excess) fat and gain some muscle.  I'm also looking at P90X, because I've got 90 days and all the reviews I've read about it say it's legitimate and fantastic, you just need to stick to it.  Any help? "
1516,Changing workout routine often vs. same workout,"From your experience are there any benefits of changing your workout regimen often?  As in experiences in muscle growth or weight loss?  I usually get in 3-4 times a week to weight lift.   I'm pretty boring. I like to stick to the same muscle groups on a particular day. I like to by habit stick to some semblance of a routine.   However, it does get boring and i lose focus. Thanks in advance. "
1517,Sleeping while not lying down,Is sleeping while not lying down (for example in a train or in a car) not as good as sleeping lying down in bed? How do you compare 1 hour sleep in a car vs an additional 1 hour night sleep in bed? 
1518,How can I increase ab depth and size?,"I understand that ""Abs are 70% diet and 30% training"" and all of the other cliches out there about ""how to get a six pack"". This is not the purpose of this question. I think all of those cliche sayings have ruined my focus on abs. I went from training hard 5 days a week to decently easy ab workouts 3 days a week because people kept on saying ""abs are made in the kitchen"". I do not want to know how to cut fat off of my abs because I don't have much as it is. I can see my abs and obliques very well and I am now working for ab depth and mass.   So my question is, how can I increase the depth of my abdominal cuts and the size of my abs? I'm assuming that both are related in that - increasing ab size increases the depth of the cut.   Current Ab Workout Routine    Currently, I am training abs 3 days a week for about 15 minutes. I usually pick three exercises and do as many sets of 20 reps as I can in 15 minutes. I can usually complete 3 - 4 sets which (or 180 - 240 reps). I switch it up every day and make sure I target obliques, lower and upper abs. I usually take one day to focus on hanging ab workouts so I'm not always on the floor.  Current Exercise Regiment   Crunches Hanging leg raises Ankle Biters Bicycle Crunches Static Crunches Elbows to knee Side Twists Bottoms up Side plank Mountain climbers to the side (Raise knees out to the side) cacoons in and outs   Routines Occasionally I'll use one of these routines   P90x Ab ripper x Insanity cardio abs Greg Plitt Ab Assault   Advice I was given    I started thinking about this because of some advice I was given recently. Yesterday I auditioned to be a model in a new fitness magazine. The interviewer said that he would like to see me increase ab depth. He said that increasing reps (to 500/day) and training abs daily would be really increase the depth of my abs to make them really ""pop"". Does this sound like good advice?  "
1519,Did I tear some kind of core supportive muscle / what injury did I do to myself?,"I've just had a really nasty pain in my side, on the pelvis/pelvic girdle. It feels like it was related to some core supportive muscle. While it's mostly resolved within 72 hours, I'm curious what I probably did to myself.  Background  At the start of this week (Monday), I went back to finish some heavy physical (manual) work I hadn't done for many weeks. Over a 2 day period, it included a considerable amount of reaching into an awkward (hard to access) location, and digging out clay soil/gravel and pushing in replacement clay, at a very awkward angle. The ground is covered by beams about 18 inches apart, and I needed to get about 2 feet below them and dig there. For part of it, I could get down between the beams, but for other parts I needed to reach from above or from awkward angles from adjacent spaces.  The shovel was a small handheld one, so it wasn't that heavy, but the force to push it into the ground, or hammer soil into place, and lift it out at awkward angles, was quite a strain.  By that I mean that for part of it I was having to hold the (quite small!) shovel backwards in my hand and dig backwards, for other parts I was resting over a beam on my stomach/pelvis tilted head close to vertical to reach down to where I needed to get.   I was also quite considerably twisted mid torso while doing this, both to reach where I could work, and when moving, or lifting, or dumping the soil out of the hole, and this meant I was twisted while either exerting force or trying to move - so the poor positioning and twisting and reaching were dynamic while moving loads and exerting force, not just static in between them.  I also had a small amount of heavy lifting, which I did properly (ie not putting spine and back at risk).   There wasn't much like of this, but it required muscles working in difficult/unusual directions and I knew it would leave me aching for a day afterwards.  Pain  The day after finishing (Wednesday?), I got a pain I've never had before, in a location I've never had it before either. It felt like it originated at the top of my pelvic girdle, about halfway between my left side and spine in my back. (I'm right handed if it matters)    Because spinal pain can be nerve related or mislocated, there's a chance the issue was elsewhere, but I don't think it was. It didn't feel like it was related to muscles of the spine as my back itself didn't hurt.  The sensation was stabbing and eye-watering. It was quite similar to how a sharp cramp in the calf feels. It stayed local in the pelvic area, so I didn't feel pain in my spine or close to my spine, or in other places on my back or hips or leg. It seemed to be very closely related to core supporting muscles, because when I was sitting on a chair, and my body automatically used the front and back torso muscles to maintain an upright sitting position, the act of that muscle group automatically tensioning to pull my body a bit more backwards was when it really hurt most.   Over about 48 hours, more than a few times, it took time and effort to get up from lying in/on the bed, to try and find a way to get vertical that wouldn't cause that pain. But if I walked slowly and tried to keep my torso vertical (and avoid that automatic self-correcting movement), it mostly wasn't a problem walking around or working. I found myself holding my back slightly tilted forward at the pelvis in a way that made me think of the lumbar posture associated with spondylosis, but I knew that was just accommodating the pain and wouldn't last more than a few days. To get out of bed, I moved my legs across and off the bed, to help me tilt and raise my body from a prone position, which made it easier.  There was also a slight pain from the matching place at the front of my pelvis, but that felt more like a ""reflection"" of some kind of the original pain, if that makes sense - not an actual or second injury site. If I had to guess, I suspect that the opposing muscle group may have been under unusual load or strain as a result, and suffered somewhat?  I only very rarely use painkillers but this one was severe enough that I dug up some old co-dydramol and an ibuprofen for any inflammation, to handle it, without hesitation, which helped. I did the same the second day as well.  After 2 nights (about 48/72 hours after the pain started) (Friday) it began to diminish to feel more like a bad battering or bruise, so it's pretty much ignorable now.  What injury did I actually do to myself? "
1520,Does it matter when during the day carb intake occurs?,"I have heard from multiple sources that ""no carbs in the evening"" is supposed to be a good way of decreasing the fat buildup and facilitating weight loss. Now while I am aware that none of these sources is a nutritionist, but they are also people that work out a lot and read health and training magazines.   So I wonder if there is any sound reasoning behind this statement, or if it is just an urban myth of some kind. I can imagine that unused carbs are probably processed into adipose tissue when the body is inert during sleep, so it kinda makes sense but I'd love to know more about it, since I normally have light breakfast and sometimes light lunch, train just before lunch or in the afternoon and finish it off with a proper meal for dinner. By proper meal I don't mean buckets full of food obviously but a sizable portion which usually includes some sort of carbs and proteins, and a sallad on a good day.   Does it make sense to shift the main carbs intake to the mornings considering that my workouts are almost exclusively during lunch or afternoon sessions? If so what alternatives are there for evening meals, since pasta, bread and many vegetables as well as most fruits are out of the question?    Here's some reference information:   from LiveStrong article - ""How to Eat Protein in the Evening for Maximum Weight Loss""      Consume all of your carbohydrates and simple sugars earlier in the   day. If you work out in the morning, you can eat half of them before   your workout and the other half after. This nutrient timing strategy,   referred as carb stacking, is recommended by ""X-treme Lean"" authors   Jonathan Lawson and Steve Holman. For example, you might eat all of   your carbs for the day before 3 p.m. The faster you want to lose   weight and the slower your metabolism, the earlier you should cut out   carbs to let your body burn its stored fat for energy.   and another bit of info from DailyMail- ""Should I cut out carbs after 6pm?""     Not eating carbohydrates after 5pm is an idea patented in the diet   book 'Starch Curfew' by Joanna Hall - a sports scientist and the diet   and fitness expert on ITV 1's This Morning program.   and finally from Bodybuilding.com - ""5 Forgotten fat loss tips""     Tip 2: Avoid Carbohydrates After 6:00 PM      Experience has taught me that eating carbohydrates after 6:00 PM will   increase my potential for fat storage. Many people I have trained have   also experienced a similar effect. After our final meal of the day,   which no doubt would, or at least should, comprise around 45 percent   complex carbohydrates, especially if we had trained prior to it, there   is little point in eating more of this macronutrient until the   following morning.  "
1521,Can a workout be too short?,"I am trying to build up some basic fitness from basically zero. But, I have to spend quite some time in front of a computer-screen. Gyms drive me crazy (too many people around...) and running just is not for me (yet... who knows?). What I CAN do, though, is short little workouts during screen-breaks.  But is that even effective? Is, for example, bringing my heartrate up with about a minute of cardio-excercises going to help me burn fat, or am I just going to look silly?    Thanks, Layna "
1522,Recommendations/tips/improvements for a training program with my current gear,"I am 18 years old, 66kg (146lbs) and 180cm (5'11"").   Gear: treadmill, power tower (pull/chin-ups and dips), two dumbbells with weights of 30kg (max. of 20kg per dumbbell), a resistance cable and a WonderCore II which I could use for a bench for dumbbell presses and sit-ups.   I am currently thinking about a training scheme, preferably every day except Friday. I have some experience but am completely new to pull-ups and dumbells. I would mostly want to train my chest, back, biceps, triceps and abs, since I train legs enough during cycling and running. I would prefer to not do too much cardio since I would like to gain a lot of muscle and my stamina is already sufficient.   Scheme:   Monday: Chest (dumbbell press, diamond pushup, chest dips) + triceps (tricep dips, diamond pushup, two-arm tricep extension).   Tuesday: Biceps + shoulders (bicep curls, pull-ups).   Wednesday: Back (chin-ups,?).   Thursday: Cardio (20 min running or HIIT with sprinting).   Saturday: Abs (sit-ups especially).   So my question is, what could I do on Sunday or how should I shuffle some of the muscle groups per day since this is hard to decide on for me. Also, do you know of any other good exercises (for my back and abs or anything else) with the equipment I've got? I will find warming ups on the internet.  "
1523,Is it possible to workout too long?,"Is it possible to workout too long? If so, why?  At the beginning of this year I started really working hard at the gym and would lose track of time and would sometimes workout for almost 2.5 hours. The workouts usually consisted of 2+ hours of intense weight lifting followed by 15-20 minutes of ab workouts. I never had any negative side effects from it though. After doing some research, I noticed a lot of people thought this was too long.   I may need to create a separate question for this, but I've recently read that during long workouts BCAAs may be beneficial. Would adding BCAAs mid-workout allow you to increase the workout length?    Edit: Here is an example of some of the things I came across. It seems that a lot of people say things like ""Don't workout longer than an hour."" I want to know why, and just blaming it on overtraining is not a sufficient answer.   This article says this:  ""And after sixty minutes your body will start to produce less testosterone and more  cortisol, which is a hormone that eats muscle tissue and increases body fat storage.""   Is this true? "
1524,Muscle-Mass Workout Routine for 14-Year-Old,"so I'm a 14-year-old who wants to maintain a low body fat, and also have a muscular physique in about a year.  I am 5' 11"" (about 180 cm) and weigh around 126 pounds (about 54 KG).  I think I maintain a low body fat since my ribs are very barely noticeable.  I have ab muscles from working out in the past (as a 12-year-old) and have put my focus on my triceps and core so far.  I have a pull-up bar, a bench, and 15-pound (about 7 KG) dumbbells.  My questions are:  What weight dumbbells should I be lifting? What exercises should I do? How long will it take for me to grow a visible muscular physique? What should my diet be?  Thank you very much! "
1525,What are good examples of healthy snacks?,"I'm trying to lose weight, and I'm looking for something healthy to snack on. I've tried eating different kinds of fruit like apples, bananas, and grapes. Most of the time, the fruit will go bad before I have eaten it.  I still go back to my habit of buying/eating potato chips. I find that there's something addictive about chips that makes me want to eat most of the bag in a sitting.  Can anyone recommend a healthy snack that has that same sort of ""addictiveness"" that I can substitute for keeping potato chips in the house? What makes chips so addictive anyway? "
1526,Health benefits of numerous mini-exercise sessions per day,"I have a desk job which involves a frankly ridiculous number of phone meetings. As a generally hyperactive person, I take advantage of my wireless headset and pace back and forth, do dips using my office chair, go to the restroom, etc.  I recently had the idea that, once each meeting, I would do 10 pushups, something I can do without difficulty. My thought was that if I do this each meeting, I would end up doing somewhere between 60-120 pushups over the course of a day, with about 30-60 minutes between each ""set"". My question is, would there be any benefit to ""working out"" like this? Given that each set doesn't stress the muscles so much, would the compounded fatigue have any benefit? "
1527,First marathon down. Now what? How to train over the next few months?,"Last week I ran my first marathon. I had trained for months, eaten and rested well, and read Haruki Murakami's What I Talk About When I Talk About Running the week before the race. Consequently, I was very pleased with my time of 3:46:23. In fact, I was even encouraged that I could become a good runner over the next few years.   I plan on running my next marathon in March, but I wonder how to train during the winter months. Are there any seasoned runners out there with some advice in this regard?   Also, I am considering participating in some shorter races over the remaining not-too-cold weeks of the season. Having never done this before, I would like to know how to approach the changes in regiment and mindset that (I predict) go along with the change in event. Again, I defer to the seasoned runners: what do you have to say?  Thanks so much! "
1528,Why do professional swimmers breathe every stroke in freestyle?,"TL;DR: What is the thinking behind turning to breathe every stroke (i.e. every two arm pulls) in freestyle?  Isn't this wasteful, since breathing necessarily disrupts your flow?  I'm a keen swimmer, swimming 3-4 miles a week freestyle. I breathe every 3 strokes (six arm pulls) and thought this was a great idea since      it doesn't disrupt my stroke to keep turning to breathe it presumably means I have decent lung capacity.   But then I see Michael Phelps and all the others breathing each and every stroke, and I can't exactly argue with them. Why? "
1529,Is walking up the stairs a good exercise ?,"I'm planning to take the stairs ever day and was wondering if its a good exercise?  There are 9 floors, with about 180 steps of 6 inch or 15 cm, so it would be a total of 1080 inch or 27.5 meter height difference.  Would walking up these stairs once a day be a good exercise? "
1530,What can I do to start gaining weight?,"I am 6 ft tall 20year old boy. I currently weigh 60Kgs.  I take regular diet which consists of morning breakfast, milk, day lunch, evening snacks, dinner and half liter milk in night as well. In spite of all this, I am not able to get fat and gain weight.  What is the problem? What should be my diet plan and what should I eat/what not. Is there any problem with metabolism ? As I feel hungry even after 1-2 hours of heavy lunch/dinner. "
1531,What's the point in hitting abs during a workout?,"I was watching Conor McGregor's media workout (2016-08-12) in preparation for UFC 202 and saw that his training includes being hit in the abs:    What's the point in hitting abs during a workout? E.g., does it aim at developing abdominal muscles? "
1532,Are there any effects of fasting on cognition?,"I'm curious as to whether intermittent fasting, like eating once a day (warrior's diet?) or eat stop eat has an impact (especially negative) on your mental performance.  I'm aware of a study showing during the month of Ramadan, when people fast all day, the number of traffic accidents increased. But I thought that since Ramadan is fasting of food and water, the dehydration could potentially impact your mental state.  In another example, children who eat breakfast tend to do better at school than those who do not. This would be a model of eat stop eat, because (I'm assuming) the children skipping breakfast eat only lunch and dinner, so thats a 16 hour fast and 8 hour feeding window. Is the result true because low income children cannot afford to eat breakfast, and they tend to do worse in school? Or is it because the feeling of hunger, (which they are not used to, which also would be almost nonexistent in a ketogenic, low carb diet) is distracting them from their school work?  The reason I am curious is that fasting-based diets are coming into vogue for weight loss and lean muscle growth, and I'd like to know the effect this might have on other aspects of my life. "
1533,What training approach should I have to miss gym for 2 months?,"So I have to go out of the city for 2 months to my hometown.Now I do have a gym there but it's a very small and simple gym,they do have basic equipment but the weights are not much heavy.For ex.I need 25kg DB for lunges but the gym only has 12.5kg.On the other hand,in case of core lifts like squats,bench and DL,I will have problems in squats and DL coz I do 4*3 sets of 100 kg but plates are up to 80 kg only, besides in bench I won't having anyone to spot me. So in this scenario what should be my approach to training,I don't want to lose my strength/muscle gains and the sessions also should be challenging enough. 1.I usually do a heavy training approach for straight gains, should I switch to a more rep range style? 2.Should I incorporate explosive movements and if I do,what type? "
1534,I have atrophied pectorals. How should I train them ? Pictures,"Before I  show you my photos taken from different angles, I want to explain how I train.  Biological informations AND Diseases  I'm a 22.5yo male, 1.70m (67 inches), I think I'm between [20 ; 25]% BF.  I think I have a pelvic anteversion.  From June, 2017 to April, 2018, I suffered from sevear chronic insomnias (&lt;5 hours, quite often 2 sleep hours). Since April, 2018, these insomnias are mostly cured.  I think I have a gymnecomastia (since a lot of years and I believe it's due to hormones).  Training dates  Before september 2018, I trained all muscles (excepted back in thickness and lumbars) only with small weights (&lt;= 20kg 44lb) during several months spaced by pauses of several months... Well I don't think these weird periods are actually important to take account.  I seriously began musculation 9 months ago (i.e. : since september, 2018).  Food  Since I was 19, I always payed attention in excluding sodas and sweet things.  From september to 1st may, 2018, I think I didn't eat I haven't eaten enough proteins for example (only 2 eggs per day whereas I eat 4 now).  After 1st may, 2018, a typical day is :   Breakfast, 8:00 : Omelet with 2 eggs + unsweetened yogurt + 1 flour bread (50% white, 50% complete), with nuts, bread pine nuts, etc. + linseed and olive oils Collation, 10:30 : 20 grams of almonds Lunch : 80 grams of rice-quinoa, or 80 grams of lenses, or 80 grams of red and white beans AND carots or green beans or spinash or broccoli AND 25 grams of cheese AND 1 apple AND Sunflower+Rapeseed+Oleisol+Grape seed mixed oils Collation, 16:00 : 20 grams of almonds Collation, 18:30 : 40 grams of muesli (oat flakes, raisins, etc.) + 10 grams of almonds + 20 grams of peanuts + 2 squares dark chocolate 85% of cacao (all of these things are added to the muesli) + 1 banana Dinner : 2 hard-boiled eggs AND linseed and olive oils AND sometimes 2 sardines (or tuna) + 80 grams of rice-quinoa, or 80 grams of lenses, or 80 grams of red and white beans AND carots or green beans or spinash or broccoli AND 1 pear (or two mandarins in winter) AND 1 unsweetened yogurt AND 50 grams of cheese Collation, 22:30 : 1 banana + sometimes, some milk   Almost always no coffee nor tea.  My training  Supersets  I always used supersets, in each of my workouts. For example, bench press + lat chest pulldown.  These supersets, however, defer from what we commonly understand by ""superset"" (according to the moment of the workout of a given day) : on monday, at the end of my workout, I do Low pulley cross-over in ""superset"" with Side raises.  Choice of the weights AND Realization of the movements  Since Septembre, 2018, I can't tell you with accuracy how I chose the weights and how I realized the movements.  Since approximately March, 2018, I followed this protocol :     PROTOCOL #1 -   I use weights that hurt me at 40 sec. Then, I rest-pause for 15 sec. Then, I use the same weights for 20 sec. I contract during 0.5 sec, then I isometry hold at maximum of the contraction during 1.5 sec, then I stretch during 0.5 sec, finally I ""hold"" during 0.5 sec at maximum of the stretch (i.e. : I don't make pause at this max).      This is done for any exercise and for each of my 3 work series (I don't speak about my warm-up series). The weights are such that the targeted muscle is always well worked and my posture is good (these both constraints are prioritary over all - if there is any problem, the weights must be decreased). Each of these 3 series for a given exercise is in superset with another serie of another exercise (i.e. : antagonist movements/muscles).   Since 1st May, 2018, I followed this protocol (which allowed me to increase a bit the weights) :     PROTOCOL #2 -   I use weights that hurt me at 30 sec with isometry holds (however, my aim is : 40 sec). Then, I rest-pause for 15 sec. Then, I use the same weights for 20 sec. During the 40 sec, I don't isometry hold except from when I'm getting hurt near 30 sec (to achieve my 40 sec). During the 20 sec, I never isometry hold (to do the maximum number of repeats in 20 sec).      When I hold, the same times are used as in PROTOCOL #1.      By the way, the same remark can be done as in PROTOCOL #1.   Powerlifting or Aesthetism (speaking about all exercizes) ? Dumbells or bar (only speaking about pectorals exercizes) ?  Since 1st september, 2018, I was used to do 5 powerlifting series (each one during only 20 sec) followed by 2 aesthetism series (each one during approx. 1 minute or a bit more, I wasn't as precise as I am now and thus I didn't measure). At bench press only AND for PL series only, I used bar. I can't remember if weither or not these both types of series followed any of the above protocols.  Since 1st March, 2018, I only do 2 aesthetism series (each following PROTOCOL #2). I only use dumbells.  My pre-training (warming-up) consists in increasing the weights until I reach the first serie's weighs. 4 series of warming are dedicated to that and it's called ""potentiation"" ; I never reach nervous/muscle fatigue during these series. I always used potentation.  My pectorals exercizes   Bench press with Lat chest pulldown Inclined press with Cable row Unilateral Cable crossover at low pulley with &lt; something e.g. Side raise >   My pectoral-focused anatomy   Please, remember that maybe I have a gymnecomastia. By the way, my sternum is quite large and the muscle insertions at the center of the pectorals are very short : pectorals appear to be espaced (a bit more than my thumb). The bottom of the pectorals are still more espaced AND it's very rounded. The combination of 2. and 3. results in that my pectorals don't have a very large surface : only 12 cm 4.7 inches from left to right, at approx. 3cm from the top of my pectorals. Measures were taken only for my left one. My right pectoral seems to have still less surface than my left one (in both horizontal and vertical directions) : there is, maybe, left-right asymmetry. I think anterior deltoid, my back and my triceps are too developped compared with my pectorals. When I bench and do my cross over, I try to desollicit my anterior deltoids by puting them at back. I try also to keep my back on the bench... Since my arms are not very long, exercizes like inclined bench should be useful to isolate the top of my pectorals. I'm not going any lower than the parallel to the ground in benches.   My question  How should I change my training to have better pectorals, considering my poor pectorals anatomy and all of these informations ?  Pictures  [website]"
1535,Does running faster cause more injuries?,"If I run a fixed number of miles, is there any solid scientific evidence on whether running at a faster speed makes me more likely to get injured? I'm a physicist, so my tendency is to try to make models based on mechanics. Presumably injuries like plantar fasciitis are caused by strain that exceeds the elastic limit of the tissue, and strain should be proportional to the square of the speed at which I run. This suggests to me that injury should depend critically on speed: if my speed is below a certain threshold, then my tissues never go past their elastic limit, but once I get past that threshold, I suddenly start doing damage.  So speed kills -- true or false? Is there any good evidence-based medicine on this topic? The following is the only thing I've come across that seems possibly relevant: [website]On the other hand, people often do get plantar fasciitis even when all they do is stand or walk around. "
1536,Fruit as optimal post-workout snack? What else besides fruit?,"A friend asked me once if eating a banana was a good post-work out snack, to which I gave him a knee jerk reply of ""any fruit is a good post work-out snack"".  I've conditioned myself in to thinking this because I've often heard and have experienced myself that having something that consists of simple carbohydrates (e.g. the natural sugars in fruit) that is also nutritious after a workout is a great way to start replenishing your body.   But is fruit really that great post-workout by itself?  Should you combine those simple carbohydrates with something else post-workout beyond water for rehydration?  What about proteins and fats post-workout (either immediately or within 1-2 hours of finishing)?  Are all fruits created equally in this context of being a post-workout snack or are some better than others?  Let's assume that by ""workout"" I mean something between 30 minutes to 1 hour where your heartrate is averaging over 70% of your maximum heart rate.  If that doesn't narrow it down, perhaps answers may describe what workouts are a post-workout snack of fruit desirable and which ones aren't. "
1537,Does sweating have any correlation with how effective my workout is?,"I start my workout with a 5 minute very fast run to warm up. Then I start sweating.   Then I move to weights which causes me to sweat more in the first 20 minutes, after that my sweat usually goes away and I finish the rest of the workout without sweating or only minor sweating.   Does sweating have any correlation with how effective my workout is?   In the early parts of my workout I am sweating more, I probably have a higher body temperature, is the weight lifting I am doing at that time more effective than the lifting I am doing at the end of the exercise when I am not sweating? "
1538,V sit Vs L sit: Muscles involved,I would like to know the muscles that are involved while doing a V sit Vs doing L sit. Is one a progression over the other?  Trying V sit for just 15 seconds cause my quads to ache. Is that a weakness exposed?  Thanks. 
1539,Eating Only Cereals at Night?,"I just want to ask if eating only cereals at night is fine?  Since, I spend most of my day at work and my weeknights life at home is like to eat and sleep for the next day, I thought I could just eat light meal at night. When I get home, I spend at least 4 hours watching or something before sleeping. But since diet cereals tastes booooring, I eat the Kellogg's Frosties which is pretty sweet. So I that a fine routine at night? "
1540,Is it possible/useful to create core soreness?,"I workout my core and my abs everyday for a year now and, even on heavy workout days I have never experienced core soreness.  To be complete, I have felt abs soreness for a couple of minutes, but never a soreness lastings 1-2 days after a workout like for biceps, calves, gluts, and so on.  Is there exercices/workouts able to give that result is the whole core? Is it even useful? "
1541,What should i do to run 6 miles in 1 hour,"I am  fat, overweight (85 kg, 28 Years, 5ft 9in).  I usually eat lots of rice. I am vegetarian, do not take alcohol, sleeps at least 8 hrs daily.   I want to run 1 hr to cover 6 miles ( in order to ultimately shape up my belly).  I have on couple of occasions went till 4.5 miles. But i feel very tired after that (till next 2 days).  Now whenever i try, i give up within 30 min.   What should i do in order to increase my stamina, so that I can run continuously till 1 hr? Is being overweight becoming hurder?  I am looking for food (to go for, to avoid), other exercises, drinking habits, other habits.  Also I want to know, is it ok to run 30 min, daily? (I feel I am not doing justice to my legs)? In the gym, I only do running, no other exercises. Should i mix it up? "
1542,Working out after a long period of not exercising,"I haven't worked out in about 2 years and I want to start exercising again. My diet is also pretty bad- I eat a lot of fast food. I am only about 5 pounds over weight though, (5'10, 155 lbs) but I feel very unhealthy. My question is this. Should I work on my diet prior to getting back into exercising again, or should I just start both (working out and dieting) immediately? I'm trying to avoid getting discouraged by taking on too much at one time, but at the same time I really want to get back into shape. So, what do you think I should do, and what other tips do you have for someone just getting back into shape?  Thanks "
1543,Cut food-low body fat to show more muscular,"I have cut food.In 3 days I have seen my abs more visisle but not more stronger.Anyway.If I am working out and eating proper healthy vegetables and fruits,protein(warning 1 meal food). Will my body show more muscular? Does this help grow more muscles?  "
1544,Starting out with running and increasing flexibility,"I'm about to start running, I bought myself running shoes for 'over pronators' as I am flat footed(still not too sure what that means when running). But I have a few questions about running.   I'll be getting up early to do my runs (just as I'd feel more comfortable knowing not many people are there to watch me :P) about 6:30am. Would it be better to have breakfast before or after I run? If before, how long before should I eat before running? I haven't exercised for a long time, and when I did my stamina was pretty terrible then. So whats a good way to quickly build up stamina to be able to run for longer? At the moment I doubt I could run non stop for any longer than 3-5 minutes. Another thing I want to improve on is my flexibility, it's quite bad. What simple ways are there to better this?   If it helps I'm not particularly looking to lose weight but just generally increase fitness, although it would be a bonus. I wouldn't say I am huge but definitely on the chunky size, I'm 5'7 and weigh about 80kg... "
1545,one arm dumbell bent over row - is it a complete exercise for the back?,"there is an exercise called one arm dumbbell bent over row.  sometimes I like doing 10 sets of 10 reps alternating arms of this exercise with 60 Kg.  It makes me feel very good, and after 24 hours or more, I feel my back muscles when I contract my back.  question:  I do back twice a week, one of them I do only the exercise described above.   would this cause injury?  would this make me stronger on this exercise?  what type of muscle development can be expected?            disclaimer: I don't own the pictures that I have posted here, I got them through ann internet search, and I have added them here for educational purposes only, and for my own personal reference as they show the muscles involved and motivate me. "
1546,strength and mass,"   ''Your nervous system becomes more efficient at delivering electronic signals to your muscles to contract. You are able to recruit more muscle fibres, tense your muscles more and then low and behold you are able to lift more''   If strength is neurological because muscles alone are just strings, devices of meat awaiting to be activated by the nervous system then theoretically our bodies don't actually become stronger, we just learn to do what was already in our limits more and more efficiently, right?   This might suggest that maximum strength was already set and defined by the day we were born from our genetics and levers and only awaiting to be activated through years of training or adrenaline shots. Correct me if I'm wrong.   If this is true, then how come athletes that weight 140-160 kilograms with around 40% body fat are incredibly strong, is their strength due to the amount of calories or is there an advantage in being so fat?  "
1547,How much does a resting pulse normally vary?,"This question asked about using pulse as a measure of fitness. Resting pulse seems like a nice, simple way to do this. But I find that my resting pulse varies by a huge amount, from values as low as 63 per minute to as high as 83. How much does it normally vary based on time of day, posture (sitting or lying down), or caffeine? If it has this much variation that's hard to eliminate or account for, then it seems like maybe a different measure of fitness would be more appropriate, such as the time required to run two miles. Or if you do use heart rate, what is a better measure of fitness, the average of a series of measurements, or the lowest? "
1548,How do I sit properly and why?,"I’m trying to follow the advice from the following video and sit up straight and sit on my sitting bones.   [website]I feel the muscles on the sides of my lower back (I suppose those are the lats) and the whole position is extremely tiring.   To make matters more worse, I read it's not correct to sit straight, but one should rather be leaned backwards. That seems sketchy to me, since the neck then seems to be in unnatural position.  In summary:   should I be sitting on my sitting bones? should I sit up straight or be leaned backwards (neglecting the weird position for my neck)? why are my lats hurting me whe trying to follow the advice from the video? (bonus) is there anything about sitting the science is settled in? why are we advised to stand up every 20 minutes?  "
1549,Stronglifts 5x5 while on a caloric deficit?,"I've been training on and off for the past two years, but only consistently for the past 9 months and currently I'm 185lbs (6'2""). However I wasn't following a specific program and I was only using a pair of adjustable dumbbells and a pull-up bar.  I have now been doing Stronglifts 5x5 for 4 weeks while eating 1800-2200 calories, depending if its a workout day or not. I am also doing intermittent fasting, and cycle my carbs by having low carbs on off-days and high carbs on workout days. I eat 1-1.5g protein per pound of body weight. I normally have a cheat day on the weekend where I have around 4000 calories.  This is how I looked right before I started Stronglifts:   I know most people would recommend a bulk for me especially on Stronglifts 5x5, but my priority is to rid myself of as much fat as possible while hopefully maintaining muscle or even building a little (since I am new to many of exercises in Stronglifts). I estimate my bodyfat at 15-16% and would like to get down to 10% before I clean bulk.  My current lifts on Stronglifts are:  Squat: 175lb 5x5  Bench: 135lb 5x5  Deadlift: 190lb 1x5  Rows: 105lb 5x5  Overhead press (seated): 85lb 5x5  The only exercise that is giving me difficulty at this point are squats. I have failed to complete 5 reps in the 5th set for the last couple of workouts, but I continued to add weight since I can complete 4 sets no problem. I'm thinking that my difficulty with squats is not strength-related, but more so due to decreased stamina caused by my caloric deficit. Should I only do 3x5 for squats in this case since I am cutting?  Any other feedback or advice cutting while doing Stronglifts? Anybody have any experience with this?   Thank you! "
1550,What is the best way to bring one's metabolism out of starvation mode following a diet?,"A friend of mine has obviously brought her metabolism into starvation mode by performing strict low-calorie diets (without any exercise) for over ten years. This has resulted in a yo-yo effect where she can hardly eat more calories than her basal metabolic rate without gaining weight, so she diets again every few weeks.  What is the best way to break this vicious circle of dieting and gaining weight again after eating normally? How can she bring her metabolism out of starvation mode? "
1551,Why are beginners told to relax their tense shoulders muscles in yoga?,"In most yoga poses, we are reminded to relax our shoulder muscles. I don't understand: why do we have tension then? It seems to be a natural inclination to make them active in these poses, so why is it wrong to keep them tense? And why is it a natural reflex to have them tense? "
1552,Would adding weight to a daily work increase any benefit?,"The rule with trying to lose weight is to burn more in exercise than what you eat. Eating healthy reduces the chance of you over eating and taking in more calories than you would burn off.  I'm looking to try and increase the amount of work I would need to do for my daily 15 minute walk. If I wore a bag or backpack and weighed it down with books so that I would be carrying more weight when I walk, would this increase how much I would burn from just walking? would this (adding weighted bags) work with any exercise? "
1553,Will higher level of intensity induce hypertrophy/strength,"I perform body-weight exercises. There is a general understanding of improving strength, hypertrophy, or endurance based on the number of reps you can do at a particular difficulty.  Let's say I can do 20-25 reps when doing Push-ups alone or Body-weight Squats alone, which is the endurance range. Would doing burpees induce hypertrophy, if the increased intensity only takes me to the 8-12 rep range?  Or perhaps some other intense combo of push-ups and squats that takes me to five reps, will it build strength?  Or am I just building more endurance in a shorter time? "
1554,I hurt my back from a deadlift attempt. When can I go back to weight lifting?,"I hurt my lower back doing a failed deadlift attempt.  Nothing terrible, but I feel a mild pain there.  When can I go back to weight lifting?  Similarly, my hand is sore (from a poorly done impact...) when I grip hard - do I have to hold back on weight lifting?  In general, how do you know if you're better sitting it out, or are ready to go back to the gym?  UPDATE: My hand injury was punching a wall too hard.  My middle knuckle took the impact.  Not enough to break the skin - not even a visible bruise.  But my hand became sore, especially when gripping something, for a few days.  That's mainly gone. "
1555,Is it possible to swim 125 km in week?,"Simple question, can a swimmer train and swim 125 km in week? Just curious to know if it is possible that a swimmer can train and swim 125 km every week, week in week out? "
1556,should squat weight always be over the heel?,"When doing back squats I feel a little unstable coming up. The weight shifts from my heels to the side of my feet and I have to try very hard to concentrate the weight around mid foot, and not let it move forward.  I read in other posts what the weight should always be on the heels. But from reading the starting strength, they always describe the weight as being ""over mid-foot"". So should I feel all the pressure on my heels, all the time? Or over the mid foot?  "
1557,Aerobic on days before weight lifting,"I know the key behind weight lifting and strength training is giving your body time to rest, recover, and build muscle.  So you can't go back to gym or even biking the day after.  What about the day before? Can I do heavy aerobic exercise on Monday and lift weights on Tuesday? "
1558,Is there anything wrong with doing one-legged bodyweight squats in this way and what can I improve?,"The way I heard about one legged squats is to them like this: stand, lower yourself on one leg while the other points forward, then push yourself up. When I try to do this, I don't even get my standing leg to 90° bent before the knee wit hweight on it feels weird and I run into trouble lifting the other leg.  So, today I've been doing this: squatting down (sitting on the back of my feet), and then doing a squat where I lift one leg so the other one does all the work. I think it works great and I guess I will feel my legs tomorrow. The feeling in the knees was ok.  One I will do different the next time is to force myself to end the movement with my upper body upright, today I cheated a by leaving the torso bent forward. I think when I end the movemnt with my torso upright I will also hit the posterior chain. At a later stage, I may add some weight, before I do that I want to have more feel for the movement as I'm a bit wary for my lower back. The last time I did legwork it was 30 deep bodyweight squats, could have done more, today I did 3 sets of 10 reps per leg. Keeping the balance was no issue.  However, I've never seen this way of doing one legged squats advised anywhere and I think I read a bit about bodyeight work. So I wonder if I'm doing something that's horribly unhealthy and I just did not notice.   Is this a good way to do one legged squats? Are there any risks associated with this ecercise, should I be on the lookout for certain signs of trouble? Any tricks to improve the exercise?   Edit to add: I do this occasionally, with 10-12 reps per set and leg. I try to be anal about form (feet pointing forward, weight on heel, tight abs) and so far my joints don't complain. When I'm not strict about form something feels wrong immediately. Possibly the pistol is inherently safer. Another possible downside is that it's easy to cheat oneself out of the full range of movement. You need to flexibility to squat deep (ass on heels), balance is easy. All in all I still think I stumbled upon a valuable exercise.  "
1559,Tuna in brine as a replacement of protein shakes,"Firstly, I did read this question, but I do not think it fully answers mine.  I recently started some fitness training. My goals are to have a lean body. I am 171cm/68kg and I don't care if I were to lose a few kg or not. I use very light free weights (2-6 kg depending on exercise) and do some body weight exercises.  Currently, my protein intake is at least 90 g/day while it can reach to 130 g/day. When I exercise, just after the exercise, I consume 160 g can of tuna fish in brine. It consists of 30 g of proteins for the cost of 120 calories. I do not mind the price of the tuna.  My questions are:    Can tuna in brine replace protein shakes? Although I drain the brine as well as I can, I am still afraid that I consume more salt than I should. Will this cause some adverse effects in the long run, compared to protein shakes?   Please answer this question considering my long term goals.  "
1560,Blood lactate and glucose,"When you exercise blood lactate levels tend to increase as a function of intensity. At the same time, I have seen in a few research papers that blood glucose levels tend to drop as lactate increases  What is the relationship between lactate and glucose? Why is there an inverse relationship between the two? "
1561,Heart rate monitor compatibility,"I am shopping for a heart rate monitor that I can wear during exercise (I am ok with wearing a chest strap), and I'm very confused about compatibility of monitors with gym equipment (treadmills, elliptical machines, stair-masters, etc). I would like the monitor to transmit information directly to the exercise machine.   The gym in my apartment building has Nautilus treadmills (probably fairly old ones). I know for a fact that they support external HRMs (there's a ""fitness test"" mode that displays the message ""chest strap required""), but there's no information on compatibility, wireless standards, etc. anywhere. Also, I'm thinking of joining a local gym, so ideally I'd like to get a monitor that's compatible with as many machines as possible.  So:   Is there pretty much one wireless standard that all manufacturers follow? Or are there different standards for each manufacturer? What are these standards called? Where can I find information on compatibility of gym equipment and HRMs? I tried the Nautilus website but it was of no help.  "
1562,slouched shoulders get better when i open my hands,"I have really big problems with my posture. I spent a lot of time sitting at computer for many years. My shoulders are rounded, they go forward and due to this my neck is overloaded. I have also forward neck and head.  I tried to stretch my pecs many times - but stretching did not help and it caused pain when stretched too much.  I tried also to strengthen my back muscles - but I always found the exercises difficult, leaving me with sore back muscles and not much improvement.  What I have recently found out is that when I fully open my palms (I mean straightening all my fingers, like I want to grab something really big... fingers must be all in line and wide) then my shoulders get slowly fixed - automatically - without any effort (except for the effort of holding the palms).  Just holding my palms open makes my shoulders get in correct position, I feel my chest getting wider, scapulas going down and everything feels better, including my neck.  So just by opening palms I have almost instantly achieved something what I have not achieved by years of experimenting with all sorts of exercises.  The problem is that it works only when I have my palms open. When I stop doing it, then my shoulders get back and everything is as before.  I really really don't understand it..... what's going on? Why does it work? What is the problem?  P.S. sorry for my english  P.S.2 Here is a picture of how I have to hold my hand [website]Thanks a lot for reading and for any response "
1563,Weight training for muscular endurance,"I have just started doing Stronglifts 5x5 (which is almost the same as Starting Strength). Hopefully in say 6 months time I have made good progress, but are also starting to plateu. In order to get stronger it is then recommended to decrease sets and reps: Madcow 5x5 or The Texas Method.    However at this stage I probably am not interested in getting stronger. Instead I want to maintain my strength while increasing muscular endurance. To be a bit more precise we can say that I want to maximize the weight I can do for each of the lifts in Stronglifts for 25 reps. I would say my ideal is the physique of a crossfitter. However it seems a bit intense and potentally dangerous except for very well trained, versatile and technically proficient athletes. Also their programs are quite complex. Maybe I could train almost like a crossfitter for some time first, with a simpler program, but with some of the aspects of a crossfit program.  How would I train to achieve this? Is there any program you could suggest?  I am aware that increasing the 1RM will increase the endurance. However 1RM calculators typically only goes to 12 reps. This indicates that strength in the 25 reps range is somewhat disconnected from max strength.  I notice that in crossfit they use alternating heavy and volume days. During the volume days they do each exercise for time. Maybe I could do 3 x 1 min each exercise with as many as possible reps. Also in crossfit they seem to do circuit training. That is first 1 set of squat, then 1 set of bench, then 1 set of barbell row. Then redo this complete sequence two times. I guess this is not so easy to achieve in the gym where one typically have to wait in queue. But I could do supersets. Squat could be combined with barbell row for instance. "
1564,Will I gain mass effectively with this program? Slightly modified stronglifts 5x5,"I'm very skinny (184cm, 61kg) and I have a really hard time gaining weight. I'm completely free for summer so I can sleep 9 hours a day and eat a lot of food, and I have no other stressors. I will obviously continue with training and eating after summer, but maybe drop a workout per week. Goals: To gain as much mass / weight / muscle as possible.  My plan is to do Stronglifts 5x5 program, but three times a week seems too little when I have so much time and nothing else in my life. Would it be ok instead to always have one day rest inbetween (never two), so every odd week I would do 4 workouts instead of 3? Would it be possible to add anything else? My guess is it would completely be out of the question to do a workout each day.  I plan on getting a total of 3355kcal a day consisting of 252g protein, 130g fat, 293g carbs based on TDEE calculation when bulking. Maybe more than this if I don't gain any weight (as I said, extremely high metabolism).  Is there anything I can change? Will this work? Is there anything more I can add in the gym to capitalize on the fact that I will be very well rested?  I have heard a lot of people say that 5x5 isn't optimal for putting on size, would it be better to instead follow the same program but do 3x12? "
1565,Uneven upper/lower body,"My head appears proportionally large compared to my upper body, and my lower body appears very small/thin compared to my upper body.  I am male around 5'7 and 108 pounds (49 kg). What might be causing my body to be this shape? And what can be done to correct this kind of body shape? "
1566,Does cardio decrease appetite?,"I ran before lunch today, same breakfast and same lunch-size as always, I also lifted weights yesterday so it seems like I should be hungrier than usual. But I was too full to eat the dessert I bought with my lunch (I usually don't buy one.)   On regular days, I could easily eat a desert after lunch if I had one.   So my hypothesis is that cardio can actually decrease your appetite, has there been any studies to confirm this? Does anyone share my experience? How would this work biologically? "
1567,Stubborn anterior pelvic tilt (excessive lumbar lordosis),"I am a hobby lifter having an excessive lumbar lordosis curve. A few weeks back I noticed it, and have been trying to fix it by the traditional approach of correcting lower cross syndrome.  I made a temporary routine in which I'm greatly limiting exercises that train the spinal erectors, and doing a ton of volume in anti-extension ab exercises and glute exercises that do not load the spine too much, twice a week. I am also doing hip flexor and erector spinae stretches (kneeling lunge and child pose) and trying to not sit so much.  I have not seen much change in the past few weeks, so I think I'm missing something. I noticed that some people talk about diaphragmatic breathing having an effect on APT, is that correct? I am also considering taking a deep tissue massage in the lower back area to ease tightness, will that help?  Exercises I'm doing:   Barbell hip thrust Back extension PPTHT Kettlebell swings Ab rollout (wheel/ball) Hanging knee raise (emphasis on spinal flexion) RKC plank   Here's an x-ray of my lumbar spine:   "
1568,Recommendations on an ALL-ROUND Program,"I need some expert advice regarding the all-round program which I have decided to follow religiously, please point out any discrepancies.  Goal: To build muscle and lose fat. (possible, please see)  Current Stats: Male, 23-year-old, 175cm height, 67kg weight  Estimations: ~ 20% body fat, TDEE (from the online calculator) ~ 2400  Past Experience: Been lifting moderate to heavy weights from the last six months. However, resting at the moment for one month because I underwent a surgery (everything is OK).  Workout Plan:     5 days a week (1-hour max/session), hitting body parts twice per week in the evening (except abs), and will be   lifting heavy.      Abs (Whole core): Daily, first thing in the morning (for frequency,   please see); 6 exercises (for workout routine, please see)   Cardio Plan:     45 mins walk on training days, immediately after the morning abs   workout.      20 minutes HIIT on non-training days, immediately after the morning abs workout.   Diet Plan:     7:00 am (After the morning abs workout and walk): Shake (4 bananas, 1   cup milk, 25g Whey)      11:00 am: 3-4 boiled potatoes, beef kebab, 25g Whey.      1:30 pm: 2 Chapatis OR white rice with a vegetable curry OR beef OR   chicken.      7:00 pm (Pre-workout): 4 bananas, 4 dates.      8:45 pm (Post-workout): 25g Whey.      10:00 pm: 3 boiled eggs with a glass of milk.   Note: The diet is going to be consistent, no cheat meals, no processed foods, minimal use of sugar and total abstinence from soft-drinks/juices/fast foods etc.  I am hoping to gain lean muscle mass and get rid of the fat I have, would this plan be useful?

1569,how can I carry on doing heavy bench presses for a long time?,"I do bench press twice a week. Tuesdays and Fridays.  every week I do 180 Kg.  I have been doing this for months now. OK I cycle every 6 weeks how I get to 90% or 100% but I keep it high.  Sometimes things happen, like the other day my son woke up many times during the night, and daddy needed to take care of him... can't expect the best bench, still we manage to go.  And before this I was doing it once a week, very difficult to miss one week.  Here is a video of me lifting 200 Kg (440 lbs) for illustration purposes only.  and here are 2 pins I have on my left shoulder due to a motorcycle accident in 2012.   I have recently changed the bench press position from ""bodybuilder"" to ""powerlifter"" because of inflammation and pain on my chest tendon.  This has really helped a lot the chest tendon, but it takes some time to get used to it.  what can I do to maintain this level of training with the possibility in due course to try new PBs (personal bests) once in a while?  I asked my doctor, he says the chest tendon can snap without a warning when submitted to heavy weights.   I take vitamins and supplements,  try not to get too stressed at work,  try to have minimum sleep,  I am vegetarian, and try to keep a good diet (though I am a bit on the overweight side now). "
1570,Slight panic when weightlifting?,"I'm new - more specifically I'm about three months into starting strength. Tonight for the first time I felt a slight panic on my squat and my deadlift. Nothing too serious - just thoughts that I could seriously injure myself at the weight I'm now at (I work out at home, alone).  Is this normal? How would you suggest I curve this - is it time for me to start training with a partner for safety's sake or can it still be safe squatting 100kg without others around? "
1571,Should one keep track of workouts and if so how?,"To get fit in the gym / lifting weights, is it important to keep track of how much weight you lift, which exercises you do on which days? What's wrong with going by feel? What are the advantages of keeping track on paper as opposed to an app? "
1572,6 Grams of Essential Amino Acids Post Workout on Keto Diet,"I need this community's help to solve a problem that doesn't seem to have an answer that I can find online anywhere.   First, let it be known that I am following a ketogenic diet plan which disallows all sugars and (almost) all starches, which results in a very low daily carb count.  Virtually all of my carbs come from green leafy veggies (and other veggies).  What this means is that: Eating a ""protein bar"" that has more than a trivial amount of carbs is not an option. I recently read a book called ""The New Rules of Lifting"" in which the author asserts that in order to prevent muscle degradation (and actually promote muscle build up) after a weight lifting workout, one should consume ""6 grams of essential amino acids"" immediately after the work out. (Exactly how soon after I am not clear on, but that is the subject of a different question.) Between the time that I lift my last weight, and the time that I can get home and cook a proper keto meal, at least 1 hour passes, sometimes more, depending on how bad traffic is that day.  What this means is that: I need a convenient source of protein to consume after a workout that amounts to at least 6 grams of the essential amino acids without this source being a common protein/energy bar or a protein shake (both of which are usually very high in carbs).   What are my options?  Is there anyone on here that has faced this situation?   Thanks for the help!! "

1575,Home training works against my BMI,"I was on about 87 kg to 88 kg. With my height of 1,94 m, it was pretty damn good in terms of my BMI :) I nearly hit exactly the middle of the target value of a mid-twenty male.  However, I started to train for a run a few weeks ago. I'm running nearly every second day (8 to 11 km) and do a few push-ups (20) and sit-ups (30) twice per day.   I noticed that I've gained about 3 kg! Okay, I just would've thought ""Yep, have to be the additional muscles"" but it concerns me, that my BMI is out of range. Is the BMI reliable when it comes to added muscle mass? Should I try to stay in the target range regardless of the training?  "
1576,Training to regain monkey bar ability without hurting shoulders,"When I was a child, I had no problem with going across the monkey bars. Sure, my hands were usually sore afterwards (as much as anything because the outside bars had a tendency to oxidize and form deposits along their surface), but I could do it. I recently tried, just to show my nephews it could be done, and I made my way across, but my shoulders and upper arms were in a great deal of pain afterwards. I know that, to get better, I probably just need to keep doing it, but I'm also 35, so I'm well aware of how easy it can be to injure oneself, and shoulders are notoriously easy to damage. Eventually, in an ideal world, I'd like to work up to being able to do swings and laches, but that's in the future, of course.  So, is there any good progression or exercise for me to follow? Should I start with just hanging for longer periods of time or am I best off going right into going hand-over-hand?  As a further update, bolstered by the advice that I wouldn't sustain lasting damage most likely, I went ahead and hit the playground. Doing the monkey bars is difficult, but I can manage it. My shoulders and elbows ached a bit afterwards, but it was manageable. The worse part, at this point, is my hands start hurting quickly, but calluses will no doubt improve that. "
1577,Calorie calculations for weight reduction,"When trying to calculate how much I should eat for weight reduction what should the base calories be based on?  My current weight or my goal weight?  I'm 5'8"" at 240lbs wanting to drop to 180lbs or less if at all possible.     "
1578,what to look for in planks,"Is there a checklist of things I should look for when trying to see if someone's doing a perfect plank?  They always say back straight. I assume that means head to glutes because, unless your legs are on something, they're gonna have to be bent.  Anything else? "
1579,"Does ""bracing"" the core increase the risk of injuries like hernia?","I have had an inguinal hernia surgery about an year ago,and am back to normal lifting,now in case of lifting weights near the PR's we know that we have to brace the core in order to keep the torso stable and both hips and shoulder should rise together(in case of squats) to have a good rep.But bracing the core means keeping air within the diaphragm and contracting the abdominal muscle for a tight torso,now I know that this puts pressure in the abdominal wall,so should I prevent heavy squats or I should keep  just doing it,just keep my progress steady? Also are there any corrective exercises for a person who has suffered from inguinal hernia like strengthening the abdominal walls? "
1580,How does a 5x5 program work on a cut?,It seems to be the consensus that on a cut you should not change your training program and continue to lift heavy. Although it is also commonly stated that the body cannot gain muscle and loose fat at the same time.  How can a 5x5 program such as starting strength or strong lifts work on a calorie deficit? In theory you shouldn't be able to progress at all since your body does not have the calories to add muscle? Do people just stay at the se weight during the cutting phase? 
1581,"Dead lift, best way to gain strength and power","I'm able to dead lift 5 sets x 5 reps @ 250 lbs OR 5 sets x 3 reps @ 300 lbs OR 5 sets of 1 rep at 400 lbs....the total weight differences are:   5 sets x 5 reps @ 250 lbs  = 6,250 lbs 5 sets x 3 reps @ 300 lbs  = 4,550 lbs 5 sets x 1 reps @ 400 lbs  = 2,000 lbs   Increased single lbs lift BUT decreased total lbs being lifted.  What's the impact to strength, power, size and calories burned?  So, basic question is, how do you determine the sweet spot where you still gaining overall (strength and power) while burning (short/long term) calories?  "
1582,"Can muscle become ""adapted"" to one kind of exercise?","I have a gym at my house and i mostly workout alone, my brother who was been doing workouts for long time taught me some exercises.   If I do mostly the same exercises for each body part (biceps, triceps, back, legs and etc) will I stop gaining muscle? By increasing the weight every 2 weeks or so  will prevent stagnation ?  "
1583,Triceps/rear delt take over rows,Everytime I row my rear delts and also my long head of the tricep take over the row.  I have also tried dumbbell/cable pull overs and it's the same time thing... my delts and arms get all the action while my traps and lats remain totally fresh. Anyone has had the same experience? how did you manage it? any advice?  Things I have tried: T-bar rows Cable rows Bent over rows Penlay rows  Dumbbell rows Machine rows  Band rows  Inverted rows  Methods tried: Using arms has hooks Tumbless grips 
1584,running in the mornings,"I have been running now for 2 months and completed a 10km training plan, and I love it. My wife works evening though and u don't go running until about 9.30pm (after dynamic warmups). Now I'm adding some hills to my training plan next, and some beginners hills where I live are off road and dark at the time I have been running.  My question is I want to switch my hills to early morning. I'm scratching my head about what I should be eating and how long before the morning run I should eat then leave? Any advice from fellow early risers?  Edit:   I'm following the BUPA 10Km advanced plan (after doing basic and immediate). My only goals are to increase my pace over 10Kms  [website]"
1585,is the squat a complete exercise for the legs?,"This week I am starting a program of squats twice a week - Mondays and Thursdays.  They will not be heavy squats, but a volume training.  10 sets of 10 reps with 100-110 Kg   Squats in this case, are the powerlifting style, when you go down below parallel.  After this sometimes I do some leg press, not so heavy.  should I include anything else on this routine so that it is complete for the legs?  As it is, I already feel it after 36-48 hours.  I have just noticed that there is a very good question/answers here:  Leg exercises that complement squats?  but there it does not mention the situation when you are doing squats twice a week. "
1586,At what frequency should I increase weight?,"I'm currently on Scott Dorn's Muscle Building Program, at least the exercise part.   The weights I have access to go up or down in increments of 5 pounds. How often should I be increasing weight and at what intervals? Add 5 pounds once a week, every two weeks? What would be a healthy and good progression? "
1587,"If a gram of protein is used for muscle repair, does it still provide the body with 4 calories?","We know that protein can provide the body with 4 calories per gram if it is used for energy, like carbohydrates do. Let's say though that a gram of protein has been broken down into aminos for tissue repair, does it still provide the body with the 4 calories?  I THINK that protein would only provide the body with 4 calories IF it's been converted to glucose through gluconeogenesis, but I'm not sure. Has anyone read anything that confirms this? "
1588,Should I skip the gym in middle when I can't take enough protein,"I have been working out in gym for the last 3 months.... [ 4 days week , 30 minutes per day ]  I want muscle , shape &amp; want to be fit....  I did't see any major improvements as I did't workout out intensively &amp; did't take enough protein. (maximum I was taking is 50 g protein from food per day (no other protein supplements) , but I need at least 120 g protein per day for my body weight.)   Also, due to another reason, I can't take more than 50 gm protein per day for the next month. After one month, I can take up to more than 120 g protein per day.  So, is it better to go and workout in gym for next month, or is it better to skip gym for next month? Is there any advantage in going to the gym for next month ? "
1589,What Gym exercises should i do to reduce weight instead of shaping muscles?,"I am 5 feet and 4 inches high. I am weighing 83kg these days. My tummy has bulged out, looking bad. I am caring for my diet, having lemon water in morning. But now i want to do gym exercises to reduce weight.  I have seen many people having good shaped body but they look bulky, even they have 6 packs but their tummy looks fat similar is for legs and biceps, triceps. I have also seen skinny people with good shaped bodies. By skinny i mean this  Question:  How to do exercise in gym to look like skinny body? Which exercises i should do? Is this possible what i am asking? Having skinny body, does that depend on exercises you do or on nature of your body?  "
1590,Completeness of push up and biceps curls for upper arm,"I know that for a complete exercise, you need to concentrate on many muscle groups. For example, extreme abs training with no back exercises can cause serious posture problem in the long run.  My question is, is it enough to do biceps curls for biceps and push-ups for triceps to completely work the upper arms out? Or should I include extra triceps exercises like triceps extensions?  If it helps, I am 171cm/69kg. I use 6 kg dumbbells for 24x3 curls. I only use my body weight for 10x3 push-ups. My long term goal is to become lean and fit. I am not interested in putting large amounts of muscle mass. "
1591,What is the best combination of muscle groups to workout together?,"I have not exercised properly in about a few years and I'm dying to get back into it.   I've put together the following routine :  Monday: Leg Day and Abs   Tuesday: Chest  Wednesday: Back and Abs  Thursday: Shoulders  Friday: Biceps, Triceps and Abs  Is there any benefit to working out certain muscle groups together? Should I change or rearrange these exercises?  "
1592,Does holding weights allow you to run faster?,"I'm not talking about training with weights so that when you run without them you're muscles are used to pushing more weight so with less weight it'll be easier, I'm talking about while actually holding them.  So this question arose when I decided to carry some light weights (1kg) as I went for a fast jog: I noticed how easy it was to run faster while holding the weights which got me thinking.  I figure that it would allow you to run faster for the same sort of reasons that we swing our arms in the first place but now it's just multipled somewhat. Running with weights in your hands will allow you to conserve angular momentum far better which means you should be able to move your legs at a faster rate, ie. some more of the work is being done by the arms. Moving your left arm back will contribute to moving your right arm forward, so the more momentum that is in your arm the easier it should be correct? obviously this only works with light weights as if the weight slows down your arm movements you may actually lose momentum. Are my conclusions correct?  I also guess that this will also tire out your legs more as you are pushing around more weight.  Does this all mean that sprinters should train their arms a lot in order to run faster with the higher mass causing more momentum with each swing of the arms? Does this also mean that training with weights is somewhat pointless (overall) as your core will be doing less work? "
1593,Maximalist program,"As you can see it is very hard to find a training program that includes more than just the ''big 3'', 99% of the training programs in existance are copy pasted and are all incredibly minimalistic focused only on raising your bench, squat and deadlift... as if those 3 movements where the only types of strength in existance.     It really feels like every program in existence is only focused on getting a big chest, big back and huge legs... but what about the other +600 muscles in the body? What about the other sides of fitness? fitness is not just being strong in 3 specific movements.   What I'm searching is not a program that gets me strong in 3 dogmatic movements but something to literally level up my overall fitness.  Fitness is a mixture of coordination,flexibility, mobility, speed, endurance, power, general strength, cardiovascular endurance and so on...  "
1594,Losing weight without losing muscle,"What recommendations exist to lose weight without losing muscle?  How much strength training is usually adequate to maintain muscle mass during a healthy weight loss diet?  I've been losing weight this year to improve at my sport (rock climbing).  I've lost 25lbs.  I'm 6'4"", and currently 183.  I've been losing weight at about 1-1.5lbs a week for several months now.  During the first month, I found that my benchpress and overhead press began droped.  I had been lifting once a week to maintain, so I bumped it up to 2 lifting sessions a week.  I've successfully stabilized my strength as I've continued to lose fat.  But I feel like I'm being inefficient about it - I'm basically lifting as much as I did when I was doing a strength training / muscle gaining cycle over the winter.  This lifting is in addition to my climbing specific training, so I'm having to workout 5-6 days a week.  It's working fine, I'm thinner, equally strong, and climbing harder.  But I'm wondering if I can be smarter about my training or diet.  Edit to address questions: I eat about 2000 cal a day, at a rough ratio on 20-30% protien, 20% fat, 50-60% carbs.  I lift on Mondays and Fridays, doing 3 sets of 8 of bench presses, pullups, military presses, cable rows, lateral raises, and deadlifts.  I do about 4 hours of climbing training on Tuesdays and Thursdays.  I jog 2-3 miles, 4 times a week.  Mostly to help hit my caloric goals on the nose.  I climb outdoors on the weekend, or indoors if the weathers bad.  I'm running myself ragged doing all this, though.  I'm not developing injuries or anything, but I'm getting burned out, and was wondering if I could eliminate a lifting day, for my sanity, without risking losing strength again.  Thanks! "
1595,Pilates breathing and core engagement,"I am new to pilates and have been working on my lateral breathing. It gets  tiring doing it alone. But when I do it with simple mat exercise like roll up, I sometimes feel like I am out of breath or like I don't exhale well. Lot of repetitions makes me feel heavy in the chest area.   Can anyone please suggest me a strategy to learn / master Pilates breathing ? I am working on core engagement at exhale. How important is pelvic floor muscles for core engagement?   Once engaged,  do you release the pelvic floor, abs, ribcage engagement at the next inhale ? If not how to breathe/inhale well this engaged position?   Thanks for help "
1596,Advice on running plan,"Would running a 70s 400m then resting for 5 minutes and running again a 70s 400m,repeating this cycle until total exhaustion comprise an HIIT workout?  If not, Would this kind of workout have any beneficial impact on anaerobic fitness and aerobic fitness both? Any lean muscle building?  For reference, (A 400m in 70s  is like 80% of my total effort,I can do it in 61s if I run a dead sprint)  I'm a pretty good sprinter. Rapid acceleration and hard stops are my forte.I play as a winger in  soccer games.I'm not bad at endurance but not the best by a long shot.So I asked folks at my schools track team bout increasing endurance.They told me bout continuous training. Tho they say I'd have to cut some gym.I certainly don't want to lose my muscle since its one of the main cause of the rapid acceleration. So doing some research on google on HIIT and continuous training and stuff, I thought of this plan.  My objective was to better both my sprint time and endurance. Mid distance endurance. Like 2-3miles?I have no intention of running marathons. And so I cooked up this convoluted plan.I'm sorry for annoying you folks with this convoluted plan.Can you guys suggest some improvements?  I was a 400m sprinter for quite a few months at my school until a really bad sprain put me outta commission for a few weeks.I never ran for a few months after that.Exams and stuff.  I have been working out again for 31/2 months now. Joined the soccer team just a few weeks ago.  I ran 10 sets of 200m before the joining the team.  After joining the team,I have been running 3-5 miles continuously daily.But my time isn't good.  Someone told me that continuous running like this leads to loss of muscle and anaerobic fitness.Also,I'd like not to fare badly  which I think I'd if I keep on training continuously like this.  So the thought on HIIT. "
1597,Do planks increase muscle endurance rather than induce muscle hypertrophy?,I have been told by folks that progressive overload is the only way you can induce muscle hypertrophy.  Doing more reps only increases endurance rather than hypertrophy.  So doing planks for like 5 minutes?What does it do? Muscle hypertrophy or endurance? I can't use my arms after that much time of plank so I guess muscle fatigue is a given but I can't understand how this relates to concept of progressive overload. 
1598,How do I Measure cardio fitness by heart rate?,"What are good protocols for measuring cardio fitness with a heart rate monitor?  How can I have efficient training and get good measurements at the same time?  --  The idea is to have something closely aligned with cardio fitness (Like measured with a VO2Max test).    I would do this in a gym with cardio machines, and I imagine fixing work is simpler than fixing hearth rate.  How do MAJOR fitness apps such as Google Fit support such protocols? "
1599,Target the same muscles twice in a day?,"Would working the same muscle group - twice in the same day - cause worthwhile extra muscle fiber tearing to later gain mass? Or is this not worthwhile (the extra tearing is only marginal) given the long rest period between the two sessions (say morning and evening)? Why?  Example: working the upper and mid chest in the morning, and again in the evening, working to failure both sessions using high reps and moderate weight. There will be rest for that group for the next couple days, and proper diet is regularly followed.    Here are similar questions, but they are not the same:   How good/bad an idea is it to work out twice a day? How can I best recover for a second strength workout on the same day? Going to gym twice a day  "
1600,Should you workout abs every day or include rest days like other body parts?,"Having a debate with a friend where he says you can do ab exercises basically everyday (planks, knee lifts, exercise ball sit ups, etc) and others have said that you said treat is like other body parts where you should have rest days in between to get the best results.   Looking on the internet I see both opinions so wanted to see what folks thought was a more effective approach to working out abs with the goal of getting six pack?   "
1601,Is 6 strength workouts a week always a bad idea?,"My situation: I've been to the gym before and done some weight exercises so I know the basics. Lately I'm extremely out of shape though (184cm and 61kg, with a really high metabolism). I would like to build as much mass and muscle as possible and I don't care if I gain fat.    For three months forward I will have nothing in my life (no school, no work) meaning I can sleep and eat as much as I want, nothing stressing me.   Would it be possible for me to pull off going to the gym 6 days a week (alternating push, pull, leg) without it being negative to my gains, given my situation? Or would it be better to go 3 days a week? "
1602,Is it okay to go for walk without bowel movement early in the morning?,"I wake up early in the morning (About half an hour before sunrise). I drink 2 glasses of water. I don't have any bowel movement at that time. My bowel movement occurs most of the times after 2-3 hours later.  For better health, I love to walk in the morning. I walk for around 4-5 Kms. Is it okay to walk (neither very fast, nor slow) before bowel movement? Would it give me almost same benefits as walking after bowel movement? Or is it harmful?  Further, I would like to know if I change from walking to jogging, what would be your answer?   Should I work on changing the bowel movement times or everything is fine?  NOTE: (I'm not overweight. I don't walk (or don't want to jog) to lose weight. It's just because it makes me feel good). "
1603,Are mobility exercises treating the symptom instead of the cause?,"I have just started barbell training following the stronglifts 5x5 program. Since I am having some problems with the squat I am taking some lessons from a personal trainer. In the first session he measured my mobility and found that I have poor dorsiflexion in my ankles. He suggested some mobility exercises. I also have the book ""Becoming a Supple Leopard"" and in it I find several other mobility exercises for the ankles. When doing squats I also tend to get pains in my adductors. Looking in the same book I can find several mobilizations for the adductors.  However, are not both my trainer and the author missing the point?  I watched this interesting video on youtube: Why Stretching Isn't The Answer by Dr. Quinn Henoch. He basically argues that poor flexibility is the symptom. Poor strength (in another muscle) is the cause.   Another interesting video on youtube makes the same point Improve Squat Mobility Instantly Without Stretching Following this video it seems that front planks could help with the pain in my adductors. This seems plausible since I am terrible at them.  I also think that training the adductors will help: Adductor Work for Added Gains and Construction by Adduction. For balance I should then also train the antagonist which would be glute medius I think.  For my ankles I think standing on one leg style exercise will help.  I think mobility exercises are important, but only in conjunction with strength training of the neglected muscles. As an example I trained my adductors yesterday for the first time ever probably. My range of motion was horrible. But if I combine mobility with training the adductors, they will gradually relax and normal range of motion will be restored.    "
1604,"Bench press, dips, push ups",How does carryover work?   If I get a stronger chest with any random exercise does the bench press go up?   Or is there the need to do similar exercises like push ups and dips in order for carryover to happen?  
1605,best way to cheat - cheat day? cheat meal?,"I'm on a strict diet which consists of 3000 calories 50/30/20 (pcf) consisting of chicken or beef, green vegetables, eggs, bread, and rice.  I'm 5'7"" and currently about 8% body fat. I have consistently been loosing fat and gaining muscle and I've been happy with my progress.  Is it better to polish off a tub of icecream in one sitting or across a cheat day? Is there any evidence that a cheat day is good for you? I've heard stuff that it keeps your metabolism ticking over or something. Is there any truth to this? "
1606,How to optimise running and weight training for complete fitness?,"I go to the gym in the morning (1 hour) and run in the evening (&lt;1 hour). My goals are GAINING MUSCLE, INCREASING SIZE and BEING FIT. Since both running and weight are essential components of any fitness regime, I don't want to get rid of either of them.   My gym schedule -  Chest, Back, Biceps, Triceps, Shoulder, Legs (1 muscle group each day, 6 days a week).    My running schedule -   Basic running drills and warm-up, running 2.5kms in 12 mins, vertical jumps and post-running stretches (same everyday).   My height - 181.5 cms; Weight - 73 kgs/160 lbs.   Does my running habit affect my muscle gain? Should I modify my schedule for effective results?   Any advice is welcomed. Thanks in advance. "
1607,Do double-chin reduction exercises work?,"I got suggested some exercises to reduce my double chin. They normally involve tilting the head back and, looking at the ceiling, and either making a tense kiss in the air or sticking the tongue out for some seconds, or putting some tension on the neck muscles, like when pushing the under jaw forward. An alternative are neck rolls.  Do these exercises work? Are there better alternatives? "
1608,"Is there any truth to the maxim ""cardio kills gains""?","I have been meaning to ask this question for a while, and I hope that it's within the scope of this site's FAQ. For about half a year or so, I've been going to the gym approximately 5 times a week, training back, chest, arms and legs. Lately, I've joined a HIIT class that I find very enjoyable. There are classes everyday, but I personally join three times a week, twice on my rest days and once on arm day.          My question is:  Suppose that I am on a 10% calorie deficit with all the activity above (I am using this). Will HIIT training kill my gains?      Are there any studies that support/go against this idea that cardio kills gains?  Current stats: My height is 186cm (6ft 1in) and I weigh 77kg (169.756lbs). I consume at least 1g of protein per pound of bodyweight according to the good old broscience rule, and 5g of creatine everyday. "
1609,running slow effects on legs,"I have just started running, I have noticed, that whenever I run at a slow pace, I noticed that my legs feel very painful, but whenever I run like those runners on olympics(full burst) I don't feel as much stress in the legs as I have when I run slowly. What should be the proper way to run? Is it wrong for me to run like at full speed at all times? I do feel more comfortable running, it's just I look like an idiot running really fast while other runners are running at a slower pace. "
1610,Glucose tablets before weightlifting?,"Before my heavy weight training I take creatine an hour before, and eat a banana 30 minutes before. I am wondering if it would be beneficial to have a glucose tablet right before (or during) the workout.  I usually train for an hour, beginning with compound exercises.  When I do an aerobic exercise, like spin class, I've been told that you only need something other than water if you are training for over an hour (your body doesn't need the extra energy, so it is just adding calories). When running in a marathon, of course we are grateful for the jelly babies and other sweets on the way round :)  Has anybody had success with glucose tablets for weight lifting?? "
1611,Is it good to roll your lower back with tennis ball?,As can be seen in the following link it is forbidden to practice with foam roller in the lower back. But is the situation is different with tennis ball? 
1612,Calves felt sore after long walk,"My calves are felt sore after a long walk about two~three miles today. How can I reduce the uncomfortable feeling? Will warm or cold compress help? Will lifting legs higher help?  In daily life, what can I do to reduce the chance of sore calves? I prefer low-level exercises. "
1613,Discrepancy in TDEE calculations,"After a (very) dirty bulk, I have now been losing weight for about 39 weeks. (It has been going OK.) At the start of my diet (at the end of November, 2015) I was about 110 kg. I planned my weight loss proces to be slow and long, so as to maintain as much muscle as possible. As a guideline, I used several 'total daily energy expenditure' (TDEE) calculators to find a baseline for my diet. All of the calculators I used gave me a TDEE of about 3,000 kcal. (Of course, including exercise, cardio, etc.) I eventually cut down to a weekly average caloric intake of 2,500 kcal per day. This, given the calculated TDEE level of 3,000 kcal, should be an average deficit of 500 kcal per day, which was the deficit I was looking for, and planned to maintain for as long as necessary (until I was happy with my bodyfat level).   At the time of writing (late August, 2016) I am about 90-91 kg. Suppose for the sake of simplicity that I have now lost 20 kg, since the start of my diet. That is an average of about 0.5 kg per week, which is fine. Assuming the '3500 kcal per pound of body fat' rule is true, and that my weight loss has been mostly due to fat loss, we can calculate that my daily caloric deficit should be around 500 kcal (it is actually more like 560 kcal).   Using 'myfitnesspal.com' I have logged my daily caloric intake and expenditure due to cardio carefully. Over the course of my entire diet I have calculated that my average daily caloric intake is about 3,000 kcal. Taking the above calculation into account, that would give me a TDEE of about 3,500 kcal.   Where does this discrepancy come from? On the one hand we have a TDEE of 3,000 kcal, based on age, weight, height, 'activity level', etc. On the other hand, we have a measured TDEE level of 3,500 kcal. How can this difference be explained? Is it common that the online calculators are this inaccurate? Or is it simply because my measurements (e.g. actual caloric content of food may not be as said on the package, caloric expenditure due to cardio may not be as calculated by the treadmil) are too inaccurate?   As some added information which may be important: even though my measured average daily caloric intake is about 3,000 kcal, this is not actually the amount of calories I ate daily. During weekdays I would always eat around 2,500 kcal per day. On training days this would make a net intake of 2,000-2,200 kcal, depending on the amount of cardio I did that day. During the weekend I would then 'cheat' (not really, because it was incorporated as part of my diet) by eating a lot more. The amount of calories I ate during the weekends would vary a lot; sometimes it was around 3,000 kcal, sometimes 4,000-5,000 kcal or more. Could the discrepancy be explained by the erratic daily caloric intake? I can imagine that the weight loss by such an erratic eating pattern would be different than for a diet where the caloric intake is exactly the same each day.  Thanks in advance! "
1614,How to run 1 hr/day 6 days/week without getting acne from carbs?,"In 2009 I trained for and ran in the NYC marathon. My training had me running about an hour a day, 5-6 days a week.  While training I noticed that the long runs would make me crave carbs, and I would eat a lot of brown rice, oatmeal, etc.  But I also noticed that eating all these carbs would give me acne from the high glycemic load of the food.  Nowadays I eat broccoli and carrots to get my carbs, and they don't give me acne, but they also have so few calories that I suspect (but don't know for certain) that they wouldn't satisfy cravings for calories/carbs(?) if I were to follow my old running regimen.  In the years since I was training for that marathon, I've noticed that some, but not all, other people who have similar running habits will also have acne, and I suspect it's for the same reason that I did (eating lots of high-glycemic-load carbs every day).  My question is: how can I make it work? How can I sustain a training regimen of intense cardio (running, bicycling, or swimming) one hour per day, six days a week, and not get the acne from high-glycemic load foods?  Will broccoli and carrots in combination with greater fat intake (for more calories) solve the problem?  I'm particularly interested in hearing from people who have firsthand experience dealing with these issues. "
1615,Can knee flexion exercises improve hip extension strength?,I have hyperlordosis from being seated for much of the day. I understand that I need to stretch my hip flexors and lower back and strengthen my abdominals and hamstrings/glutes to help reduce the anterior tilt of my pelvis.  I am unsure if hip extension exercises such as good mornings etc... work the lower back more than the hamstrings and therefore may be counterproductive?  I know that the hamstrings cross the hip joint and the knee and are also involved in knee flexion. Does this mean that knee flexion exercises will strengthen the whole hamstring and lessen the need for hip extension exercises? 
1616,Should I exercise when my muscles are aching?,"I exercised for the first time in a long time yesterday. This is what I did:  500 jumping jacks at moderate pace  100 jumping jacks at fast pace  10 min of running in place at moderate pace  100 jumping jacks at fast pace   Today I can barely walk, my leg muscles are aching a lot. After being seated for a while if I get up to walk it is very hard. But I noticed after a while once I'm warmed up a bit I can pull it off. So I think I will be able to do the same workout I did yesterday today.   The question is should I?  I reckon my leg muscles are hurting because I tore them up with my exercise and now in order to allow them to regrow and grow bigger I should rest. But my goal at the moment is to lose weight, not so much to grow muscle. Hence all my exercises are cardio.  For someone in my situation who is looking to lose weight and lose it fast, should I be doing this sort of cardio daily? or take breaks? If I should take entire days off how many a week?  height: 5'8 weight: 185lbs age: 23 sex: male body type: overweight  "
1617,Using lactose-free whey protein for bodybuilding,"I'm planning on bodybuilding for a few months, and I want to start using whey protein. I'm lactose intolerant and experience serious stomachaches whenever I drink milk.  I see ""lactose free"" label on some whey protein supplements, but there isn't any lactose-free protein supplements in Turkey that I could find. Do other whey protein supplements have too much lactose? If I use those supplements, will I experience stomachaches?  For example, something like the Bodybuilding.com 100% Whey Powder  states in its allergen information that it contains milk, but doesn't state anything about lactose. "
1618,Dropping weight before an uphill run?,"I'm taking part in a short but steep uphill run. It's only 910 meter, but it goes up 314 meter. The course record is 7:58, while the average exerciser (male) is probably around 14:00-15:00. Last years results (male only):     #       Time: 1       08:00 10      08:54 100     10:33 500     12:12 1000    13:15 2000    15:18 2500    16:43 3000    19:28 3300    34:00   I've always finished somewhere between 11:00 and 12:00. This year I'm in worse shape than ever, so I'm hoping I can cut some seconds by reducing my weight. I'm wondering though, will I gain a lot by dropping 1,2,3.. kilos prior to the race, or will the loss of muscles prevent me from performing better?  I'm 187 cm, 86 kg.  For the record: I don't really want to lose weight in general, but I'm willing to do so temporarily in order to get a good time. I don't have the time to exercise any more than I do now, so the way to lose weight for me is simply by consuming fewer calories.  Any other tips are of course well-received!    Pure physics (if it was straight up)  If this was a pure climb (straight up), and assuming a race time of 12:00, and body weight of 86 kg, this would require an average of 410 W. Assuming I'm still able to output the same power after a weight-loss, then the finishing time will just be 12:00 scaled by a factor of New weight / 86 kg. So, if I go down to 83 kg, I'll be able to finish in about 11:34.    But, this isn't a straight up climb... "
1619,What are superficial muscles?,"Articles like the wikipedia entry for the Forearm distinguish between superficial, intermediate, and deep muscles.  What is the difference between these muscle levels?  What are some readily recognizable examples of each?  Are deep muscles more significant or powerful than superficial muscles? "
1620,Would Tabata be any good on a stationary bike?,"I cycle most evenings when I get home from work. I read about Tabata on here and wondered if it would be any good for me? Maybe cut my total time down to 30 minutes, 5 mins warm up, 2 mins Tabata, 5 mins cool-down? I'm trying to lose fat, at a decent rate. I eat well, just want to lose it quicker! "
1621,Which mimimum set of resistance exercises should I do every day to offset the effects of sitting at work?,"I am looking for a simple resistance training program that will offset the adverse effects of sitting on my muscles and posture. Taking a look at this figure:  I see that I must strengthen the glutes and the upper back muscles. Since what I need is enduring strength rather than max strength I must exercise these muscles with low load for many reps. To make things simpler I want a program that takes approximately 15 minutes and consists of as few exercises as possible (preferably 3 or less). Also the exercises should ideally easily be done at home without large equipment. I already train with heavy barbells twice a week so I was planning on doing these exercises all the other days. In addition I train interval running once a week and go for walks so my heart is fine. Its just some of my muscles that are weak and some that are tight.  Which exercises should I do?  I have very thight hips and this is a problem when I squat so lately I have been doing monster walks and sideways walks with resistance bands as a warmup to my weight training and this is something I enjoy as I feel that it really opens up the hips. I also tried the banded bodyweight squat to reverse lunge and I liked that exercise since it reinforces the squat pattern and seems very effective for the glutes (I could really feel the ""burn"").  Also before starting heavy barbell training I did some training with kettlebell two hand swings. I dismissed it as not as effective way to gain strength as barbell training but now I am thinking that doing lighter kettlebell swings almost every day may be a good thing for the posterior chain. Having one kettlebell at home is fairly practical, it does not take a lot of space.   Even if weak ab muscles are not shown in the figure above I think this is a problem. When standing we must have some pressure in our abdomen. When sitting none. So I think the plank should be one of the exercises. I already know that I am terrible at it so it sounds like something I need.  Regarding the upper back mucles it is somewhat more difficult to find a practical exercise for this. Kettlebell or dumbell bent ower row is one option but that takes twice as long since each arm has to be trained separately. I am fortune enough to be member at a gym that is located 100 m from my apartement so I am considering using one of their rowing machines for this. I have read that rowing trains 83% of the muscles in the body. Not sure if this means that just rowing 15 mins a day on its own might be good enough exercise to offset the adverse effects of sitting? This would certainly fit the simple program criteria.    Edit: After having researched a bit it seems both kettlebell swing and rowing machine are great exercises but they have one problem; they both tend to tire the lower back. Because of this it is difficult to do them everyday. Body weight squats and the plank on the other hand seem to be something that can be done every day. "
1622,What should be my first goals and supplements when starting a bodybuilding program?,"I'm 20 years old. I am 85 kg (about 187 pounds), and my height is 179 centimeters. I don't really have any muscle. I have belly fat. I was a swimmer 4 years ago, but I haven't done any sports for 4 years. It's time to change :)  I'll go to a gym. There is a guy who will help me as a coach. He's actually not a professional coach but is just manager of the gym. Because of this, I don't trust him.   I just checked a few websites, and I found two workout goals on bodybuilding.com: lose fat and gain muscle . I'm not sure. Which one should be my goal? I'm fatty but I don't want to lose too much weight. I want to stay the same weight (maybe lose 10-20 pounds) and gain muscle. I went to gym for a few months 1-2 years ago, so I know  some basic terminology. But I don't know anything about creating a training plan. I found this plan on internet, but I don't know if it is suitable for me? I don't know where should I start.  I don't have any diet program. What diet should I follow? Should I start using supplements? I am also lactose intolerant. "
1623,Marathon - How to train for a marathon in 12 weeks?,"I will be participating in a marathon in next 12 weeks. I want to know how can I improve my stamina so that I can run for longer distances.  Also, I want to know what diet plans should I follow in order to assist the same? I've increased my protein intake and gymming for 6 days a week. On three days I'm running for 3-4 miles, but I am not satisfied. What other primitives can I follow in order to achieve my goal? Will meditation help in this regard?  And what accessories can I opt for to assist me in achieving my goal? I mean what type of shoes and other gears for improved performance. And, how can I keep track of my daily progress. "
1624,Running with a bruised knee,"I'm signed up for a 5k on Sunday. It's for fun, and I'm not worried about getting a great time, but I'd like to make the best showing that I can. The catch is that yesterday, I took a tumble over a concrete stanchion (I was being playful and hopping up and down. I caught my toe on the edge) and I now have a nicely bruised knee. I don't think that I did any lasting damage. I did a bit of light jogging this morning and it aches a bit when my weight moves to that leg, but the pain largely goes away after I stop.  Even if I didn't feel like this is a minor injury, I don't have time to schedule a doctor's appointment, and it really does seem minor. Is there anything I should be doing to ensure that I'm not causing further injury to my knee in the running? And should I take a dose of aspirin or other NSAID before the run as prophylaxis against swelling caused by the running? "
1625,Exercises for protruding stomach,"I've resumed strength training after years of just doing cardio, and have been working out for about 2 years now. I do free weights and body weight exercises. I am currently 1.83m (6 ft) and 92 kg (203 lbs)  I have a good muscular physique, but despite my efforts, I always have a protruding stomach.  I have a thin layer of fat on my stomach, an inch approx., and it's definitely not the reason for it. It seems as though there's a lot in my stomach and it just sticks out.  I also have very strong core, Id do:  1. Dragonflags - Abs  2. Weighted back hyperextensions - Back  3. Human flag on bench (can't do the regular due to shoulder injury) - Obliques  4. Pendulum - Obliques  Before my shoulder injury I also did Front and Back Lever for more than a year, so I believe my core is well built.  I heard that you should strengthen a muscle called Transversus Abdominis, but the only exercise I found for it was stomach vacuum.  What could be the reason for this? Could I have excess fat under my muscles? It seems very unlikely at such relatively low body fat percentage.  And could you recommend effective exercises for the mentioned Transversus Abdominis (besides vaccum)? "
1626,"Is there any practical difference between ""calories"" and ""calories from fat""?","I was eating a frozen yogurt earlier and noticed the nutrition label said:  Calories 200 Fat Cal. 70   I'm not sure what to make of this. I'm guessing 200 is the total calories, 70 of which comes from fat. I'm currently watching my diet trying not to take more than 2000 calories per day. Does it matter where the calories I'm in taking comes from?  I know it matters from a nutrition perspective but I mean does it matter from a weight loss perspective?  If fat calories are important is that because they are harder to burn than regular calories? "
1627,Home workouts or gym? Which one is better for adding muscles?,"I have a shoulder injury and after healing I'm going to start my workout again. I've been working for some time and I'm not much beginner. Also, I'm on fit, not fat, and I'd like to add weight and muscles. How do you think I'll get the best result? I'm very interested at P90X, but I can go to the gym as well. Do you think I should workout at home with P90X or go to the gym?  Thanks in advance, "
1628,Why parallettes have small height?,"I want to build a PVC parallette at home and I noticed that all the parallettes are very small in height( as the diminutive french suffix ette indicates , pretty obvious , I know lol )  My question is : why they have to be low? and if I increased the height of the parallette would that decrease the effectiveness of the the exercises in other words which is more challenging for gymnastic exercises , lower or higher?  Excuse my English as I am not a native speaker.Thanks. "
1629,Effects of 0 calorie drinks on weight loss,"Is there any conclusive study or research on effects of 0 calorie drinks on weight loss?   As far as I know these drinks have nothing that the body can digest, so body doesn't store anything from these drinks which means 0 calorie. However I've read that long terms effects indicate that they are not affecting the body as if they are 0 calorie.   I drink 3L of Pepsi Max a week on average. While logging my intake, should I assume they are 0 calories? (Technically yes they are but I'm talking about practically) "
1630,What to do with sore muscles,Say I have done some exercise and the next few days I am rather sore in certain muscles.  What is the best thing to do about that? Let them rest (avoid using them)? Use them a lot? Exercise more? Rub them? Hot bath? 
1631,Is it easier to gain chest than other body parts?,"so I have this problem - I haven't been exercising chest for 1.5 year now because I think it's way too big and bulky compared to the rest of my body ( read legs )  I've been doing legs(squats,deadlifts,stiff-legs, leg-press,extensions,curls), back(deadlifts/rows of all kinds) and core(plank/different exercises from boxing) for about 1.5 years now while neglecting chest completely.  As I started to get up in numbers for my weightclass (72kg, 178cm tall btw) in squats / deadlifts, a guy came up to me and told me to join the ""powerlifting specific team practice"".. so I did because it's what I've been working for anyway but I didn't have the balls to show up.   Anyway, to the point: I beat the ""club record"" in bench on my first attempt, and I'm way WAY behind the record in deadlift/squats eventhough that's the only things I've really been focusing on in life for the past 1.5 years.  I did a lot of benching when I was 17 and kind of neglected the other lifts, am I gonna be cursed forever because of this? or is it just generally easier to gain strength and mass on chest for everyone?  I'm having real trouble gaining mass on legs, they're only 58cm and stuck, my torso is 119cm and I swear to god I'll get bigger in 2 days if i do 50 pushups..?   please help  //mr boob(serious) "
1632,Starting Strength: How do I know when I should cut?,"I've been bulking since I started lifting (Starting Strength path, two months in) but have started wondering this week - when do I cut? Is this purely when I can no longer stand the fat that ultimately comes with muscle or is there a recommended ""x weeks on, y weeks off"" method popular with this program? "
1633,What are the boundary conditions for effective conditioning?,"I do muaythai and want to do something in between my (infrequent) training session to help my conditioning. I have a conceptual question about what works:   On one hand, I often hear that at least 30 min. of constant work is the minimum to actually improve condition On the other hand, Ross Enamait writes that 20 min. of elevated heart rate is enough to achieve an effect, and advises to put a lot of intensity into those 20 min.   So the question is which statement is closer to the truth? What mimimum time should I invest if I want conditioning benefits? How much active rest is allowed? "
1634,Why did my legs give way?,"I started exercising after a long time and did some exercises of legs (running, squatting, etc). The exercise was not strenous. Just after the session I had to go to a party, so I jumped in my car and drove to the location which was an hour away. When I tried to get out of the car and stand up, I couldn't. I didn't feel any strength in my thighs. I summoned all my strength and got out of the car and collapsed back on the ground. Few people helped me get in a room and I lay there overnight. After spending the night wondering whether I had lost my legs, in the morning I was able to stand back.  Now why did this happen? What can I do prevent it from happening again? "
1635,How hard I should push myself?,"How hard I should push myself?   I started to enjoy pushing my limits, thankfully :) I use elliptical cycle for cardio for at least 30 mins a day.  On average I use it at level 8/8, with 14kmh and about 160HR. At the end, for 5 to 15 minutes, I go faster at 16~ and I feel like it's almost impossible to continue. I sortof feel like losing myself physically. I avoid pain in my muscles. When I absualtely have to stop, I stop. I don't use HR but I suppose at that point I'm around 180 or more when I use my hand to count.  Occasionally, I feel like my heart stops beating or slows down for a few seconds on random times. Maybe once a week. But I feel good. Maybe that's related and is saying me to stop pushing?  I'm 100kg, m, 22, taking 1500-2000cal daily. My BMR: 1700.  The answer should be in terms of how hard I should push myself in terms of HR, feeling and post cardio effects. "
1636,What is the difference between trained and untrained muscles? Should untrained people do muscular training differently?,"Are untrained muscles (and related tissues like ligaments and tendons) different from strong trained muscles, except for being less strong? Similarly, should “untrained” people train different in the beginning?  What would such a different kind of training look like? How much would this be more about specific exercises than the muscles themselves?  "
1637,How do I bench press safely without a spotter?,"What do smart lifters do when they're working out alone and want to do benchpresses?  I have a busy schedule, and it isn't practical for me to have a regular weightlifting partner.  I've usually avoided regular benchpresses in favor of either dumbbell benchpresses or smith-machine benchpresses.  I like to lift to failure on my final set (or at least get very close to it), and don't want to get trapped under a bar.  Also, constantly having to get a spot from strangers in the suburban globo-gym I lift at seems like an imposition.  I see other people benchpressing alone all the time, so I can only assume that my fears are a little exaggerated.  What do smart lifters do in that situation?  Just not go to failure?  Switch to a smith machine for the last set(s)?  Just not feel guilty about asking a stranger for a spot?  Details about my background - I'm currently benching a pair of 60lbs dumbbells for 3 sets of 7, and feel comfortable controlling the weight.  But I'm curious about switching over to working with a barbell.  Thanks. "
1638,Are Box Squats more like dead lifts or standard squats?," I've read on a few websites (BodyBuilding and t-nation) that Box Squats are good exercises to help with dead lifts.  You don't get the full range of motion and through doing them I seem to feel more tension on the back rather the glutes or legs...so, are they somehow more like dead lifts? Is it the drive from the box that provides the benefit to dead lifting? "
1639,Skinny wrists - will this change as the rest of me does?,I know it's vain - but I'm not blessed in this department. As  I progress down the road towards the body I want instead of the current body I have can I expect my wrists to gain in proportion also?  I know that the bones won't grow - but will muscle form in this area or am I limited to only seeing gains in my forearms? 
1640,Does it defeat the purpose to bring a frozen water bottle to hot yoga?,"I have developed a habit of bringing a frozen water bottle to my Bikram Yoga class.  When it gets really hellish, having a sip of still very cold water definitely neutralizes me better than drinking warm, previously not frozen water.  But I was wondering if that defeats the purpose?   The cold water certainly cools your body, i.e. does something opposite to what the environment you are in is conditioning you to be.  Is drinking icy cold water lessening the benefit of the hot element in my yoga class? "
1641,Can walking be a way to lose weight,"After running my knees will be hurting, I will stop running after that, but still I want to lose weight.  When I start running, I mostly alternate between running and walking, it would be 30 minutes by then.  After that I can't run anymore, so can I walk? How useful is that for burning the fat? "
1642,Squat racks and barbells on first floor of home gym: bad idea?,"Is it a bad idea to have a home gym on the first floor of a house with a squat rack and barbell? Most home gyms with racks/barbells I have seen are in the basement or garage on concrete. My concern would be the occasional dropped deadlift or bailed clean smashing through the floor. Could mats, plywood platforms, and/or bumper plates mitigate serious damage? "
1643,"Arm cross stretching behind the back, how to improve it?","My goal is to improve the flexibility in arms: I want to get symmetric flexibility to the right and left. I am right-handed in writing but left-handed in most club games. The right side is becoming too strong and less flexible. I am trying to find ways to address the issue, I noticed the issue when I was doing warmup before some bench presses.  I am not sure which muscles are not relaxed: perhaps supraspinatus, infraspinatus and teres minor. After doing more and more trials, I can feel more stretch in the right joint -- perhaps I haven't just warmed up enough?  How would you improve the flexibility so that I could one day be able to do the movement touching both hands in both sides?    "
1644,What can a vegetarian eat on a low carb diet?,"I'm a vegetarian and would like to go on a low carb (preferably no carb) diet. Currently I am getting about 200grams of protein from protein shakes and eggs. Until now I have been eating rice, noodles, etc. as my other food sources. These actually filled me up and gave me energy. I fear without carbs I will feel weak and unable to function.  It seems like no/low carb dieters get the majority of their calories from meats. As mentioned I am already taking 200grams of protein so that's not a problem. I just need foods that will keep me full and energized. What low/no carb vegetarian food options are there that will do this?  Also are fibrous carbs okay to eat on this type of diet? Like broccoli, cauliflower, and other greens (I heard they don't get absorbed and can be thought of as ""free"" foods)? "
1645,How does a bosu ball theoretically work for rehabilitation?,"I'm not looking for a product review as that is not on topic on this SE and i can just google some. I've seen the positive reviews online for the bosu ball on other websites.   How is the bosu ball suppose to help for rehabilitation purposes?   Wikipedia.com has scholarly references that indicate that it's not any more efficient than on stable ground, but it didn't speak of any context relating rehabilitation.  Is the intention that it works because it increases the nerve endings to activate your muscles on joints? If so is this sound science? I'm rather skeptical. "
1646,Experiencing cramps in posterior pelvic crest after even light jogs,"Brief background: I am an experienced athlete, 30 yrs old, 190lb/5'11; I play soccer and have always had a very fast 300m.   Last couple of months, I have been doing crossfit.  I have been going up in weights well, and am getting good progression in the olympic lifts (about +45 lbs every 2 months--I understand this will plateau, but it has been going well so far).  Since I was doing well, I decided to watch you tube videos on tips for olympic lifts.  These involved adjustments to foot, ankle, and knee positioning to better activate the posterior chain.      I put these adjustments to the test about 2 weeks ago during a deadlift->front squat->burpee progression.  I got an amazing workout and was sore for days--as if it was the first time I had ever squatted before.      However, about 4 days later, we did another leg intensive workout...and within minutes, I was nearly unable to stand, my cramping was so bad in the posterior pelvic crest area (right where the elastic band of the shorts sits along the lower back).   I figured this was due to new recruitment and soreness.      That being said, today we did a conditioning workout that involved 400m runs.  During the first warm up run, I was cramping within 100m.    This continued and worsened throughout the workout (which involved dumbell thrusters and 400m runs.     Only 3 weeks ago, I was crushing 400m runs in ~1:15, even when alternating with weight workouts.  Now--after just doing these exercises differently--I am cramping and can barely complete any workout involving the lower body.     I am trying to figure out how to fix this, since it is very alarming to go from a high level of performance to what feels like below-baseline level performance in just two weeks.    If it is a blood flow problem, ok I can buy lighter shorts; if it is a new muscle recruitment-pattern problem, ok, it'll go away when the muscles get stronger; but if it is some other kind of problem?   Is it abnormal? "
1647,Which is the proper technique in overhead press?,"I recently started working out and realized that one can to overhead press in two different ways.   (I can lift more) I root myself leaning slightly back so that all the weight when lifting concentrates on my hips/lower back(I can feel it there, this is my stabile point) (I lift quite less) I try to be straight and lift it, without any lower back support.   Which way should I use and why? What are the certain pros and cons to those ways? "
1648,Does exercise REALLY increase the basal metabolism rate for any significant length of time after the exercise is over?,"I am new to this site, but have read several questions and answers here that are related to this question and have found different contradictory answers.  Some say that the only effect is that a larger lean muscle mass will burn more calories.  Some say the extra lean mass will burn a lot more calories, other answers say that the lean muscle mass effect is small, such as only 10 calories per extra pound of lean mass per day.  Some answers say that only intensive cardio exercise will increase the BMR, others claim there is no significant effect from cardio exercise.  So, please don't make just state an opinion or make general qualitative statements.  How does actual quantitative research answer this question? Where are the studies and data? "
1649,Should I keep head in one line with the body?,"I recently talked to a friend physiotherepist and she said that the head should be in one line with the body. (No leaning backwards/forwards).  On the other hand I see many people tilting head backwards when doing deadlifts (when they lean forwards).  So what is true about that? Is that harmful, or not at all and what policy do you keep? "
1650,How do I prevent chafing?,"I believe just about every long distance runner, hiker, and many more sports enthusiasts have run into the ever long problem of chafing:      caused by constant rubbing of another part of the skin—two thighs, for example.   source  What are some preventative measures that can be conducted in order to prevent chafing?  Are these techniques universal to all sports/activities or are these specific measures that need to be considered for each sport?  note: I went hiking the other day, and even with my 'under armor' spandex I had some chafing in the upper thigh area "
1651,What safety issues should be considered before running barefoot shoes on bad pavement?,"   Possible Duplicate:   What are the downsides of minimalist running shoes?       I want to start walking/jogging. I am considering the Adidas Adupure and Fila Skeletoes, two articulated toe models available in India.  I am concerned about the safety of thin soles. Sharp stones/ shards are a constant worry, so not only it must be safe, but also durable against repeated attacks. It must be safe from small puddles, not letting water in. Also I must be safe in slippery/sandy surfaces.  Are these shoes safe for a beginner running on bad pavement? Are there other health issues to be aware of? "
1652,"If using bike or jog commutes as active recovery, how much can I push and still count as active recovery?","Since it's a commute, we tend to also want our speeds to be reasonable. Getting there in less time encourages us to cycle there more often. Even if you live close to work, a round trip can make the recovery ride long enough for a workout done the day before. A commuter might decide to go briefly outside the recovery zone briefly to avoid missing green lights. A few seconds earlier can save you up to two minutes!  If we do 30 seconds all out, it would be HIIT even though it's brief. Doing HIIT everyday can cause overtraining. Interestingly, 100m sprinters are able to do many reps a day and not overtrain, making it important to draw the line. Pushing too hard makes it no longer active recovery. [website]What I know is that even though must of the time is spent in recovery zone during intervals, doing it everyday is likely too much.  What intensity levels or heart rate can we do and for how long and still count as a recovery day?  How long can I sprint to make that light? The light might expire in 5 to 10 seconds. Some traffic lights have shorter cycles, can be activated by pedestrians or cyclists, don't display how much time is left, or their lights are obstructed, making them less predictable.  In another example, let's say there's 20 seconds left for the green light and it may be missed by 5 to 10 seconds at an easy pace. Can I ride at the VO2 max zone for up to 20 seconds to make it? The VO2 max zone is more than twice the power of that of the recovery zone. If not, should I ride at the threshold zone which is only about up to 20% less than the VO2 max zone to make it instead?  "
1653,Spine pain after crunches,"I am doing crunches since 3 weeks. From last 1-2 days I am feeling pain in upper back/spine. The intensity of pain is not much, but i am feeling it all day.  I am doing 3 sets of crunches (20 MAX in a set).  Is it normal to have pain after crunches? (or may be I am doing it wrong way)  The pain has just started in last 1-2 days. Should i do abondon crunches until pain is gone (or should i carry on with it)? "
1654,Why does this author recommend that you should do only one set of deadlifts?,"[website]  The deadlift uses only ONE heavy set. ONE. Really. Sets-across deadlifts do not work, because for the deadlift more is not better. Trust me on this.   Why does he recommend to do only one set? Does this only work for novices? "
1655,How can I improve my reaction speed and timing for martial arts?,"I'm interested in what exercises/training I can do to help with reaction time and timing for martial arts.  Specifically, how can I improve parrying and countering a strike?  I'm not looking for speed drills (speed is different than reaction time and timing).  I need to be able to react based on some cue and then determine the on-coming strike speed so I can appropriately parry it and counter...any suggestions?  "
1656,How long do injured joints continue stabilizing?,"I dislocated my shoulder about 9 months ago.  I had thought it healed well until I started trying to play throwing sports again.  It feels normal now anytime except when I try to throw a ball hard.  I've had a few minor (i.e. not all that painful) subluxations when doing so, and no longer have the range of motion to throw very hard.  Right now, I'm debating between surgery and giving up throwing for a while and hoping for the best.  How long does a dislocated/subluxated shoulder continue to improve in terms of stability and range of motion if strengthened via normal weightlifting, stretched with normal stretching exercises and not reinjured?  If it's unstable now, is there still a decent chance it will gradually improve even after 9 months? "
1657,How do I train my calf muscles?,"If the goal is functional performance in a power sport (speed, acceleration, vertical jump), how should one train calves, if at all?  Here are the alternatives that I can think of:   Don't train calves specifically, but train barbell lifts like deadlifts, squats, and power cleans and let the calves adapt to those lifts and your sport Train calves in addition to the barbell lifts using isolation exercises (calf raises, etc.) Train calves in addition to barbell lifts using plyometrics (box jumps, etc.)   Another way of phrasing my question is: is there a benefit to training calves above what is achieved via standard barbell lifts (and your sport), and if so, how should it be done?  The answer may be different for a novice than for an advanced trainee, so an answer that covers both cases would be best (I'm somewhere between the two).    Here are some specifics about me, but I'm hoping to get an answer that applies to any athlete training for a leg-dominant power sport (football, soccer, ultimate, rugby, track):   I play ultimate I've been doing a strength training program very close to Starting Strength and am at the intermediate level on squats, close to intermediate on deadlifts, and still a novice at power cleans, bench, and press Practices are 2-3 times per week, each 2-3 hours long  "
1658,When are the physical benefits of a single workout realized?,"When does your body actually build muscle in response to fatigue from a workout?  For example, if you slam your arms in one work out ( say any combination of, curls, pullups, pushups, bench press, etc. ), will its effect on the size of your arms be immediately evident, or will they mostly grow during recovery?  Does it vary by muscle group? "
1659,Should I eat a lot of calories while doing musculation if I already have some fat?,"Concerning musculation, and as I see some fat on my hips and on chest, should I eat more calories, or my muscles can get calories from my current fat (which can be calories if I am not wrong) ? Is fat can be seen as a calories stock ? "
1660,Need help with lower back pain while on stronglifts 5x5,"I just started doing strong lifts 5x5 program and am paranoid about hurting myself.  I am almost 300 lbs, and haven't done much exercise other than walking for the past long as I can remember.  I was having some problems achieving the correct squat depth, but today I was able to get down low enough.  I am still only squatting the bar as I want to make sure I get my form correct before adding weight.  Today I felt fine while and during the squats, but when i later got to the barbell rows I felt a twinge in my lower back.  I decided not to finish my sets, because I don't want to hurt myself, but I need to know a few things.  A.  Is having some lower back pain expected when doing this kind of stuff? B.  Is it possible the lower back pain was caused by barbell row form or is it more likely that it was from improper squat form? C.  If my back is hurting how long should I wait to try again? "

1663,Constantly bonking on short runs,"I've been digging and digging at this and am finding all the information completely overwhelming. I want to get to the point where I can dependably run 3-4x per week, for about 6-8km. Since starting about 2 months ago, I've been bonking (maxing out) at about 3km every second or third run. We're not talking about marathon training here — I'm bonking about 3km! I ran twice this week, one 6km and one bonk at 3km, under extremely similar conditions. Let's look at the differences:  A TALE OF TWO RUNS  Good run:    Supper: big salad + chicken/mozza ravioli  Pace between 5:35-6min/km (great for me)  Run at 9pm 4. Almost all downhill till about 4km   Awful run:    Supper: fish tacos with rice and beans and avocado  Pace between 5:35-6 to start  Run at 9pm  Slight hill at 1.5km  Complete bonko at 3km.    These runs are so frustratingly similar I can't get to the bottom of it. My current thought is the extra exertion on the hill does me in? That's the only real variable between each day. My next few runs, I'm going to see if I can avoid all hills and stick religiously to a 6min/km pace.  Any other ideas? This is getting really frustrating. My goal was to do 6km last night, but at 3km I thought I was going to have to lie down on the ground ( and die ). Thanks all!  [ UPDATE ]  Hey all!  Turns out the advice given below is pretty good. I was doing a few things way wrong: I was running fast as much as possible, I was not being careful on hills, and I wasn't watching my breath/heart rate...etc...  My current plan:  Since I figured out that my NikeWatch does intervals, I've set my watch to 3:1 walk:run. I'm going to stick to that for a few weeks, then move to 4:1, then 5:1 etc etc...I'm being ultra careful on hills (often I'll just walk rather than let my heart rate jump up too high), and I'm also being really careful about my pace overall. I'm generally trying to stick to above 6min/km.     In short, I'm trying to just go slow. In doing that, I haven't had a single bonk in about 2 weeks now. Thanks a lot for the replies here, really appreciate the time!  "
1664,Why can extreme athletes eat so many calories without health risk?,"Michael Phelps (the famed Olympic swimmer and many-time gold medalist) is one of the most fit people in the world, and most people would look at him and say that he is extremely healthy. However, he eats (all!) of this in one day:     Breakfast: Three fried-egg sandwiches loaded with cheese, lettuce,   tomatoes, fried onions and mayonnaise. Two cups of coffee. One   five-egg omelet. One bowl of grits. Three slices of French toast   topped with powdered sugar. Three chocolate-chip pancakes.      Lunch: One pound of enriched pasta. Two large ham and cheese   sandwiches with mayo on white bread. Energy drinks packing 1,000   calories.      Dinner: One pound of pasta. An entire pizza. More energy drinks.   That is about 12,000 calories. Obviously, that many calories, that much cholesterol, fat, and sugar would be bad for 99.99% of the world. But my question is, are lots of calories/cholesterol/fat/sugar/whatever bad only if you don't burn them off, or are they always bad? It's not uncommon for extreme athletes to eat a lot of calories--do the statistics show that they are more likely to get any types of cancer, heart disease, diabetes, or anything like that? Or is there something that makes them immune to the detrimental effects?  Is it the obvious answer, that they're only bad if you don't burn them off? If so, then does that apply to any person who can maintain the calories-in : calories-out ratio? Since I have always been skinny, can I eat as many eggs as I want and be confident that as long as I don't start gaining weight, the cholesterol is not bad for me? Or is there something else about athletes that protects them from the negative effects? "
1665,Circuit Training makes me feel sick,"When ever I do circuit training I feel sick for hours afterwards.  I do squats, lunges, bent over rows, push-ups, standing shoulder press, alternate biceps, over heads triceps, and abs and then rest for 60 seconds and do it all over again 2 more times.  I usually do it in the morning but I feel sick even if I eat before my workout.  Does anyone know what could be going on?  Has anyone else experienced this? "
1666,Lower back tightness after sprinting: strengthening?,"After I sprint (usually 100m) for about an hour with breaks, I tend to feel tightness in my mid-to-lower back around the spinal cord. I am wondering if this is a symptom of a weakness (if so, how do I go about self-diagnosing?) and how I can strengthen that area in particular with regard to sprinting?  I'm in good health otherwise, fairly strong and not overweight. "
1667,Calf Muscle - Stiffness in calf muscle after running for long distance,"I ran for a long distance and developed stiffness in my calf muscles. I have tried stretching out and hydrating myself. Also I'm giving proper rest to my body. Now the stiffness is easing out a bit.   My question is, what regime or precautions should I follow so that I should not develop any more stiffness in my calf muscles? Would running again for short distance after 2-3 days will ease out the stiffness, as if I'm getting used to it?  And what normally is the recovery time? "
1668,Fastest weight of gaining mass,What determines the best way of gaining muscles? Is it necessary to keep low on fat while high on proteins? I have heard fats help in building new muscles.  Are mass gainers really effective? How are they different from usual protein supplements?.  While buying them what should we be looking for?  There are so many brands out there. Its a bit confusing.  Do testosterone pills help to increase mass gain? 
1669,What is the difference between actual age and body age?,"How is a person's body age different from his actual age, and how is this body age calculated?  In the gym I used a machine to find out my body age, and it showed my body age as 4 years more than my actual age. What could have caused such results?

1671,Importance of conditioning for weightlifting,"I long struggled with improving how much weight I lifted for lats, chest and shoulder exercises. Things were much better with legs, calves, upper back and core.   I long suspected that my body responded better to aerobic exercises than anaerobic, even when it comes to strength. However, I now strongly suspect that rowing machines, running and jump ropes provided those muscle groups with conditioning that other muscle groups simply did not get; My bench improved once I started doing pushups on my off-days.  My question is, can my suspicion be justified? How important is conditioning for weightlifters? "
1672,What causes knee pain after cardio?,"I have been having knee pain after I do running, cycling, or any cardio workout that uses my legs. How can this be solved?

1676,How to improve stamina without burning too much calories?,"a fitness beginner here. Hopefully someone can share some alternatives on cardio training for a skinny person?   For some background, I can commit to hit the gym at least 2-3 times a week. I have ectomorph body-type, which means I have high metabolism and lose weight very easily. My goal is having the stamina to play casual basketball game without panting too much, or running consistently on 5K. I have been jogging for about 4-5K once a week for 3 months, because I am afraid to lose too much calories if I ran too often. I do not really feel any improvement on my stamina, every jogging still feels as tiring as before.   Should I keep this pace? Or do jogging more often like 2x a week and increase my daily calorie intake? Thanks in advance! "
1677,Sore knees from playing squash,"My situation:  I am 23 6'1/1m85, 188 lbs/85kg and I play squash at a national league level. I usually train twice to three times a week, always having at least a rest day inbetween. However, when there are tournaments, I often find myself having to play on 2 to 3 consecutive days. The first of these days is perfect as far as my knees go. However, on the following days, I will get sore knees while playing, with both knees being equally sore.  This only seems to happen with squash. I once prepared for a half-marathon and ran 10+km everyday for about 3 months, and I've never experienced trouble with my knees.  What I've read:  Apparently the problem I have is short quads and/or short hamstrings, or quads that are not equally strong on both sides of the knee. I don't think I have arthritis because I don't fit the symptoms. Moreover, I should've felt discomfort even when running I suppose. I've had bad posture when I was younger, where my upper thigh muscles were too short and were making my back arch inwards - this is why I think it might be a short muscle issue. Other than that, I have good shoes, and the squash floors have decent shock absorption.   What I've come for:  I would like to have your take on this.    Do you think it could be something else ? Did you have the same issue with high impact vs low impact sports ? How would you recommend to stretch quads and hamstrings best ? I can't seem to do it properly What exercises would you do to strengthen the quads ?   I'm looking forward for your advice. "
1678,"In relation to Low-Carb diet, Why I feel hungry after I eat?","I am on my second day of a low-carb diet.  Never done one before, but I really need to lose 15 pounds to be on my ideal weight.    Today I had a great big lunch. (Burger meat with bacon and cheese, tomato slice, lettuce and brocoli).  Also at dinner another great meal. (New York Strip, with arugula, lettuce, spinach, and tomato)   I am not sure why, but after both meals, I felt hungry.  HUNGRY  Should I be worry?    I found this thread, where some people are saying that artificial sweeteners are the culprit for continues hunger.  They say that some people will produce insulin just with artificial sweeteners.  IF that is my case, that would defeat the purpose of doing a low-carb diet, right? "
1679,Switching from elliptical machine to running on road,"I've been recovering from a knee injury for the past few months that I got playing football (soccer). Initially, when my knee was too sore to run properly, I started using the elliptical machine to stay fit. Gradually increasing the resistance, after a few months I was running on the highest resistance setting for 30 mins, and had built up quite a bit of muscle on my legs. My knee was feeling a lot better, so I started playing football again. When I play I feel fine for the first 20-30 mins, but after that my knees (and legs in general) feel weak, and tire easily. When I run on the elliptical machine on full resistance it's hard work, but is it having a negative impact on me playing football? Would I be better off running on the road? I understand that elliptical machines are easier in the joints, are my knees unused to strenuous activity and so when I run on a harder surface they become strained?  "
1680,Heavy head after running,"Twice now, I've had the phenomenom that after a running competition, my head has gone very heavy and woozy. Its kindof hard to describe, but it sortof feels like needlepricks in my forehead, along with bigtime sweating and a general woozyness.  It does get somewhat better when I'm in a well-ventilated area (like outside), but doesn't go away completely as it tends to come back when I get back to a hotter area.  The first time, it did go away after a while once I got to a cooler area, the second time it lasted until I got something to eat, and then went away almost instantly. What is also weird is that the second time, it only occurred 4-5 hours after the actual run (and I had already eaten and had ample liquids in that time).  I've had someone take my blood pressure and heartbeat when it occurred, but everything was normal on that account.  Could I be having some kind of deficiency, caused by the stress of a running competition? I was thinking something like salt deficiency or iron, although I doubt the last one.  Anyone encounter something similar after heavy exerction?  Sam "
1681,What happens if I stop exercising?,"Let's say after a year of strength training and cardios, I'm fit and well built. For some reason, I stop exercising at all and maintain a random diet that is consistent with my daily calory burn.   What would happen?  Do I lose the muscle in the next year slowly?   Does the muscle becomes fat slowly due to lack of usage? "
1682,How to combine food sensibly?,"I am a vegetarian, mostly happy with my diet. I noticed that some meals are a bit harder to digest for me than others, which lead me to Google for “good” food combinations. As usual, I feel a bit lost in all the information and I feel that there aren’t many good combinations left :-)  One of the rules that’s repeated quite often (and therefore got through the first sanity-check information filter) is that proteins should not be eaten with carbohydrates. Doesn’t that leave out some very common food combinations like bread + cheese or bread + scrambled eggs? What about common side-dishes like potatoes or rice, aren’t they disqualified once the meal includes a big source of protein? And what about foods that are a good source of both carbohydrates and proteins? (The rule seems to break down completely there.)  I’m not taking this too seriously and I’m certainly not going to starve here. But I am quite interested in good food combinations from the practical perspective. (Where “practical” means “not willing to eat single-food meals all day long”.) So, returning back to the core question, how to mix food sensibly? What combinations are bad for most people? "
1683,Duration of warm up during workout,How much warm up is supposed to be done?  And for how much time? I workout for two hours but adding the warm up makes it very exhausting. How much time should be spent on warm up?  Is it necessary to do stretching after workout as well?  Is it ok to skip warm up? My age is 19 years.  Will not doing warm up affect my performance as I grow old? Is it also necessary to warm up with a lighter weight before starting with a heavier one? Does it really help? 
1684,How to keep your weight from rising (after lowering it) without a strict diet forever?,"I can only lose weight keeping a certain diet (other diets, even suggested by doctors failed, also exercises don't work, doing or not exercises don't change the speed of me losing weight).  That diet is mostly avoiding carbohydrates, my lunch was mostly green stuff (eg: cabbage and similar things) and some protein (like egg, cheese, etc...) and for dinner a can of tuna.  When I do that, I can lose 1kg per week.  When I don't do that, I get back 1kg per week...  In two years I went from 126kg to 99kg to 110kg to 98kg to 119kg, if I eat tuna every dinner, I lose 1kg per week more or less, if I don't (for example if I eat tuna inside a bread, or eat a pork sandwich) then I get fat again.  How I stay below 100kg without eating tuna every single day forever?  EDIT: From those wondering why tuna? Well, I like tuna since I was a little kid, this is why when I designed my weight loss diet I used tuna as protein source...  EDIT2: I already eat less than the average person, weird questions relating my diet (""why you eat so little? Are you sick?"" or ""why you don't eat rice like that builder dude over there? You are young, rice is good!"" ) are not uncommon. "
1685,How to adapt the progression in hypertrophy routines?,"My name is Chris and I have a question about how to introduce the ""variable"" progression in my hypertrophy routine.   I have been practising fitness for 15 years now but was not until 2 years ago that I realised I had no real progress. I was stuck in the very same routines, repeated over and over the same 3 days of the week. I had not a real planning. Neither I did care of the diet nor the right planification of my training.  During the last two years, I have spent time and efforts on fixing that leak of attention. I follow now a diet for gaining muscle as neat as possible (I know, this is the hard way). I'm short in stature (1.70m) and not too bulky (62 Kg). Despite my weight, I think I got good marks in my Max Reps. For example, my max reps in Bench Press is at 92.5Kg, Leg press is at 140Kg, Death weight 90Kg. Those without having trained strength ever. My fat index is around 5.8%.  I have been reading and documenting myself about the theory of the different routines based on the goals (gaining strength vs hypertrophy). I  took some time to find out my Max. Reps for all the exercises I do. Having calculated the thresholds from 100% (1Rep) to 60% (16Rep) and considering the premises I have read, I made a planning of 6 weeks for strength, 6 weeks for hypertrophy (first 3 weeks Torso/Legs and the remaining three, Fullbody). Frequency 3 days a week. It means, I do rotate the workouts every 3 days.  For example   Day 1: Toros Rest Day 2: Legs Rest Day 3: Torso Rest, Rest Day 4: Legs   And so on.  That said, now I'm unsure how to set the progression in my routines of Hypertrophy. The thing is I actually do a weaved progression. For example   Bench press : 3 series of 12 (70%), 10 (75%), 8 (80%) Curl Biceps: 3 series of 14 (65%), 12 (70%), 10 (75%)   From week to week I change the complementary exercises and the order of those, but not the number of series nor the thresholds.  I found this progression to be exhausting. I barely can finish the last series (80%) completely.  Since I'm not focusing on gaining strength at this moment, I was trying to figure out how to set a proper progression that allows me to generate stress during all the training without failing at the very end. I have read that is counterproductive to train that way (up to the fail).  Would be productive to do a more linear progression? For example, incrementing weight (2.5Kg to 5Kg) from week to week instead of from series to series. Let's say, the first week working around 65%, the 2nd week around 70% and the 3rd around the 75%.  For example   First week / Bench Press: 3x12 65%  Second week / Bench Press : 3x10 70% Third week / Bench Press : 3x8 75%   Or no progression at all  For example   First week / Bench Press: 3x12 65%  Second week / Bench Press : 3x12 65%  Third week / Bench Press : 3x12 65%   When working hypertrophy, what's more important. The weight? The overall number of series? The time we put muscles under pressure?  For clarification. My main goal is rather aesthetic. I would be glad to improve strength too but I would like to focus only on one goal during the next weeks.  Thank you in advance and excuse my poor English :-) "
1686,Is burning 500 calories every day on 1500 calories diet unhealthy?,"In the last month I started a diet. I ate about 1500 calories daily and every second day I used to workout for about 45 minutes. My daily work is in front of computers, so I barely move at work. However, I was walking to work every day (30 mints) and returning home walking as well (30 mints). However, by the end of the month I only lost about 1 KGs and that was too frustrating. I need to note that on the weekend I wasn't exercising. So now I decided to make my diet stricter, but I have no idea why the previous plan didn't work well.  I just want to recap on my previous diet:  1- workout 3 times a week: Monday, Wed, Friday. I used to warm up using this workout: [website]2- I used to eat around 1500 calories daily. Breakfast: 2 pieces of toasts with some cheese + protein shake (one scoop). Lunch: around 900 calories. Dinner: 2 pieces of toasts with some cheese + protein shake (one scoop). I also ate a banana at work.  3- Results: lost only 1 KG.  Thus now I decided to make it stricter as the following:  1- Workout 6 times a week: one day my weight lifting workout, the second day walking and burn 500 calories. I will have only Sunday as a rest day.  2- I will eat similar to above, but I will skip toasts at the dinner and only have the protein shake.  My questions are the following:  1- is my new strict diet healthy?  2- If I stick to only eating 1500 calories a day and then burn 500 calories everyday, is that also healthy and ok?  3- can you estimate how much calories does my workout that I described burn? Because I feel that I don't burn much. I don't end up sweating as I do when I walk for 2 hours for example. I feel like I only burn 100 calories with it. "
1687,Kettlebell weight for one handed exercises,"I am am a 28 year old male and the owner of a 16kg kettlebell which I have been using for a while now. I find this weight to be fine for most two handed exercises but when I try to do exercises with one hand like 'military press' I find that it feels too heavy and I am not confident doing the exercises.  My question is should I buy a lighter bell (or bells) or should I just push myself a bit to handle the one I have?  Also, if I do go for a lighter bell is there a rule of thumb for how much smaller I should go based on being fine with the 16kg? "
1688,"Can I do ""Couch to 5k"" twice per week instead of 3 times?","I'm currently trying to do the Stronglifts 5x5 weight training program and the Couch to 5k running program at the same time. I'm finding it hard to find time for both, especially with adequate rest. My experience tells that if I work out hard every day, or close to it, my immune system suffers and I get sick within 2 weeks.  Both the Stronglifts and the Couch to 5k programs prescribe 3 workouts per week. I'd like to change that to 3 days of Stronglifts, 2 days of Couch to 5k, and 2 days of doing nothing. I know theoretically that I could run and lift weights on the same day, but I haven't found that to be practical.  My question is: Can I do Couch to 5k (or any running program really) 2 days per week and still get good results? What is the minimum running frequency to achieve the desired results? Obviously progress would be slower, but would I still get there?   "
1689,Cardio vs. Weight lifting. Which one is better for losing weight?,"Cardio burns more calories during the exercise, but weight-lifting builds more muscle which in turn raises your RMR (Resting Metabolic Rate). I have a little over an hour to workout each day during lunch. Should I spend my time lifting, running, or a mixture of both? (if I should be doing a mixture, what should that mixture look like? e.g.(10-20% cardio))  "
1690,How to practice and improve my time for a 5k run?,"I am a beginner looking for advice on how to practice for a 5k run.   For some background, I finished my last 5k in 35 minutes because I ran out of breath easily. I played basketball (for fun) and work out 2x a week, but since that 5k I realized how bad my stamina is. My goal is to be able to run a 5k within 20-25 minutes for starter. I have been jogging once a week: 2.5k jogging, then having a short rest, then doing another 2.5k jogging. This routine has been continued for about 3 months, but I do not feel my stamina or endurance improved a little bit - even my heel and ankle ached a bit during each practice. Do I need to run more often, like 2-3x a week? I assume the pain will go away once I do practice more often?  If anyone has a training plan that works for him/her, please kindly share it here. Also, when would be appropriate to expect an improvement? Thanks in advance! "
1691,"Is it important ""when"" to sleep or only ""how much"" is important?","I usually sleep in the morning till noon, is it really important to sleep at nights rather than morning or other times in a day?   Are there any documented studies about when to sleep?   According to this answer, does it affect weight loss process? "
1692,Squatting/Deadlifting - Form when adding weight,"OK, so, the gym I go to has standard weight plates, from 5KG to 25KG going up in 5KG increments...the other day, I was front squatting, I wanted to go up a little, but realised I can't go up in 1KG increments so I had to add 5KG, I found that my trunk gave in a little.  My question is when attempting to get stronger is what I had to do OK? like my form had discrepancies when trying to lift the heavier weight, to be honest I think even if I had only added 1KG, my form would have suffered.  how bad is what did? is it recommended when trying to get stronger?  "
1693,Ammonia in sweat from workout - Protein (Muscle) Loss?,"I workout early in the morning for about 1 hour. Recently, I've begun noticing ammonia like smell on my towel. I researched and found out that my body is burning amino acids to provide energy during workout. So, does this mean that whatever muscle I'm building, is getting burnt away during my workout?  What kind of food should I eat about half an hour before workout to alleviate the ammonia smell? That's as much time as I have in the morning.All advice welcome, thanks. "
1694,Cold air on the throat and lungs,"Running in cold weather sure is painful, since the cold tends to burn my throat; afterward I usually am coughing some minor flem periodically for the rest of the day.  Is there a good way to help with this?  More importantly, is there anything about this that might be harmful in the long-run? "
1695,Frequency of work out,How often one must  work out in a week to get maximum from it? Is it ok to workout seven days a week.  What should be the duration of rest between two workouts?  what is the amount of sleep required during workout? Does sleeping for more than 8hours help? Does duration of workout depend on how much heavy weight you lift? 
1696,How to overcome lack of willpower when not having access to a personal trainer or training buddy?,"During exercise I often notice that I'm physically capable, but not mentally. At some point a strong mental listlessness makes me stop my workout.  Normally at this stage a training buddy or a personal trainer would give you a good kick in the butt to create the motivation to do that extra repetion or that extra minute on the treadmill.  How can you do this if you are on your own? How can you build up enough willpower to push you through in the moments where your willpower is at its lowest? "
1697,Question about getting in shape for holiday - diet question!,"So I am off on on a sunny holiday in 4 days.  I have been hitting a low carb diet for the last 3 weeks and keeping my training up (lift 4 days/ week and cardio 3 times a week). By low carb diet I have eradicated all of the traditional carbs like bread, pasta and rice. Carbs have been coming from fruits and green veg - still been hitting around 100-130g a day (more like moderate carb intake?) and stuck to around 2000-2100 kCal (185cm/84kg)  I've been reasonably pleased with the results and bf is probably at around 11-13%  My question is two-fold:   Was this all a waste of time? Should I have kept carbs to 180-220g and just hit a deficit of 300-500 kCal? In the 3 days leading upto the holiday should I increase my carbs to cause glycogen to 'fill' the muscles and not let them look flat. Or would this bloat me up and screw up my hard work?!   Been reading a lot of conflicting material around carbs, it's frustrating!!  Thanks! "
1698,Should I stop doing cardio?,"I'm a 27 years old man, I'm 1.76m tall, I weigh 66 kilos and I have 6.6% body fat.  My current goal is to improve my posture and my muscular mass. I think I have a pretty good heart health (I have a resting heart rate of 50-56 bpm, and >I usually hit 140-150 bpm at elliptic bike/fixed rower and 160 bpm at SkiErg).  I currently do two cardio workouts of 20 minutes per week.  My thought is the following: since cardio and muscle growth ""consum"" fat, regarding my low body fat, does cardio slow down my muscle growth? If so, should I stop doing cardio workouts? "
1699,How to lift heavy stuff in an apartment?,"I am looking for a compound free height gym, but all I find is machine gyms for bodybuilders or losing fat.  I will buy that Starting Strength book, and some  equipment, I soon will move into a very spacious apartment, but how do I handle noise, and how can I avoid my weights being dangerous for floors below? Or it is a non issue? "
1700,"In a bench press, are there any tricks for determining which muscles are the weakest?","Is there some trick to determine which of the three basic muscles is the weakest in a bench press? I'm referring to the pectorals, shoulders and triceps.    I have been working my chest with dumbbell presses and flies like crazy. Same with tricep extensions and shoulder press.   What am I missing?  The bench press muscle related exercises that I do:   Dumbbell bench press : 80lbs @ 10RM Dumbbell flies : 60lbs @ 10RM Barbell shoulder press : 185lbs @ 5RM (including bar) Dumbbell shoulder press : 45lbs @ 10RM Dumbell front raise : 25lbs @ 5RM Bent over Dumbbell Tricep Extension : 45LBS @ 10RM Cable tricep pushdown : 205lbs @ 5RM Barbell bench press: 185lbs @ 5RM (including bar)   The reason I asked is that I can't feel the tension anywhere once I get tired.  I can't tell if a muscle is doing more work to compensate for another.  I might as well be pushing against a brick wall and wouldn't tell the difference.   It's the only exercise where my issue seems to be more mechanical than anything else.  Maybe it's just a matter to do a lot of light/medium weights until I learn to use all muscle as an ensemble properly.    Here's my routine, all exercises are usually done in the order listed:  Monday: Legs   Barbell deadlift : 5 sets of 315lbs @ 5RM (including bar) Lying machine squat : 5 sets of 410lbs @ 5RM (this is maxed out) Lying leg curls : 5 sets of 175lbs @ 5RM Leg extensions : 5 sets of 310lbs @ 5RM (this is maxed out)    Wednesday: Chest   Barbell bench press : I can only do a couple of sets of 185lbs @ 5RM, then drop down to 135lbs @ 5 reps Barbell decline bench press : 5 sets of 165lbs @ 5RM Dumbbell fly : 5 sets of 55lbs @ 5RM Cable cross over : 5 sets of 75lbs @ 10 reps.  My 10RM is 110lbs.   I've just started doing the following:   Dips : 5 sets of 5 reps with body weight. I just started doing these Cable internal rotation (rotator cuffs) : 1 set, 30 reps of 15lbs Cable external rotation (rotator cuffs) : 1 set, 30 reps of 15lbs   Friday: Shoulders and arms   Shoulder press : 5 sets of 140lbs @ 5RM Superset the following three exercises:   Dumbbell Arnold press : 5 sets of 45lbs @ 6RM Dumbbell lateral raise : 5 sets of 35lbs @ 5RM Dumbbell bent over delt raise : 5 sets of 25lbs @ 5RM  Dumbbell front raise : 5 sets of 25lbs @ 5RM   I also do arms on Fridays, but haven't settled on what works yet. But my latest stats:   Cable tricep pushdown : 205lbs @ 5RM (maxed out) Triceps pushdown V-Bar : 5 sets of 180lbs @ 7RM Bent over Dumbbell Tricep Extension : 45LBS @ 10RM Dumbbell alternate bicepo curl : 5 sets of 45lbs @ 5RM Cable standing triceps extension : 5 sets of 135lbs @ 5RM - this one really burns Eazy-bar preaqcher curl : 5 sets of 70lbs @ 5RM (bar not included)  "
1701,Will I make good progress in my shoulder strength if I exercise them only once a week?,"I'm trying to increase my anterior shoulder strength in an attempt to help rehabilitate my shoulders. When I was younger, I did lots of push ups in order to get bigger triceps and chest muscles. As a result my front shoulder and chest muscles became quite developed, but my back and rear shoulder muscles were neglected.  I think that's why I have a shoulder problem where my shoulders easily dislocate and I have some impingement problems in my right shoulder.   I've recently been trying to increase my rear shoulder and back muscle strength. But because of my schedule, I've only had time to work them out once a week. I'm wondering if this is frequent enough for increasing strength? Or will I need to fit in exercises more often in the week so that those muscles won't atrophy due to inactivity?  (I'm aware that I should also be doing rotator cuff exercises - and should probably see a physiotherapist about my shoulders - but right now I'm just asking about whether exercising those muscles once a week is alright.) "
1702,Should you eat junk food on the day you work out vs on a non gym day?,"I lift weights 2-3 days a week, spread as evenly as possible throughout the week.  Saturday is my ""do nothing productive day"" which helps me stop burning out (this actually really helps me stay disciplined as I know there will be a light/release at the end of the tunnel).  E.g. I do no work (as in my job's work), don't gym, will read a book/watch a movie, check my facebook, let myself eat junk food (note I do not end up eating too much more calories, I just end up substituting something unhealthy for lunch or dinner), and just generally lounge about.  My question is: should my unhealthy eating day be on a day I lift or not?  What I am wondering is   Situation 1: I eat junk food and a slight calorie excess on lifting day, once a week Situation 2: I eat junk food and a slight calorie excess on non-lifting day, once a week   Would applying situation 1 make more of the excess calories turn into muscle (or less of it turn into fat)? I.e. does how much muscle you build/fat you lose depend on time between eating something and time between working out. "
1703,How to motivate yourself while working out,How is it possible to motivate yourself for work out? Also during workout I sometimes face problems to move beyond two exercises.   Like after I am done with 5 sets of bench press and 3 sets of deadlifts I start feeling very fatigued.  How can this be overcome.?  Would protein drinks do? Or should I prefer energy  drinks? Any other way to motivate myself? 
1704,Is it wrong to work 2 muscle group at once?,"I normally work out 2 muscle groups per day,a big one and a small one for example back/triceps chest/biceps legs/shoulders etc... But,sometimes I am in a hurry and I must hurry up the pace and I do them combined,for example I do a 15xLeg press I wait 20 seconds and I do 15xDumbell military press then I wait 1:30 minutes and again Leg press,20 seconds pause, Dumbell press,1:30 minutes pause a.s.o. Am I stressing my body too hard when I do this?Should I train only 1 body part when I really am in a hurry? "
1705,What sports a 30-year-old male can pursue other than endurance sports?,I am  30-year-old healthy male working in academics from India. Right now working as a researcher and hopefully would be working as an assistant professor very soon. I am a regular gym goer. I have this burning desire in me to excel at some physical activity for a very long time. But could not pursue due to various reasons.  I am very much interested in pursuing a parallel career as an amateur athlete with the hopes of becoming pro one day. Please also explain my possibilities in Girevoy. Options other than endurance sports are also welcome  Is this very late? If not what sports are feasible for me? please suggest using these parameters (but not limited to):   The Probability of participation in competitions. The time and monetary costs. The facilities required.   Thank you in advance. 
1706,Powerlift/strongman program for beginner?,"Im 270lb 6'2, starting back into the gym, i've gone 4 times now.  I've always wanted to see if I could excel in max strength and strongmen type of lifts.  I've seen this What&#39;s a good strength training program for a beginner?  Would this info be a good start? Im going to start the Stronglifts 5x5.  I dont care about looking good, I just want good form and the ability to lift heavier and heavier stuff every time.  I watch some calgarybarbell on youtube and been trying deadlift and sumo deadlifts my 1MR is 235.  I also can't do squats, when I was younger in weights class, my neck area couldn't handle the weight and now I dont have the range of motion right now to hold the bar.  Let me know if I need more info and I am new so correct me where Im wrong, even if its mindset, I want a good foundation.  Thanks all. "
1707,How best to apply TUT theory?,"I've read a few articles that the best way to gain muscle is Time under Tension (TUT) - none of the articles recommended whether it was TUT with heavy weights low reps or light weights and high reps....basically, there doesn't seem to be any 'standard' approach to max'ing the TUT.  So my question is: based on your experience, is there a good TUT? does this change the temp I should be using (standard 2-0-2) to something more extreme (10-4-10)??? I remember reading some book about a 10 second miracle approach to muscle growth.  Does this apply to hypertrophy? or to strength and power also?  "
1708,Why does the glycemic index of a carb NOT affect exercise performance?,"I read an article on SimplyShredded that claimed that the type of carbohydrate doesn't matter, but rather only the amount of carbs matter to bodybuilders.  In the following excerpt, the author claims that exercise performance does not differ with carbs of differing glycemic index.     Nope, not even endurance exercise performance is affected by the GI of   the food eaten before the training session. Neither do beta-endorphin   levels, rate of perceived exertion, heart rate, ventilation, lactate,   respiratory quotient and substrate oxidation rate. For anaerobic   strength training, the GI of the carbs you eat makes absolutely zero   difference in the gym. The whole ‘needing carbs for energy’ thinking   is in your head anyway.   This seems to go against other books I've read and videos of pro bodybuilders I've watched. In these books and videos, they always say to eat low GI foods (yams, whole grain) throughout the day for stable energy levels and high GI foods (fruit, sugar) after working out for recovery and shifting to an anabolic state.  So who is right? Does the GI of a carb matter or not to bodybuilders? "
1709,Stronglifts 5x5 and Rowing,"I have started to try out the StrongLifts 5x5 program. Started a week ago.   But, I have a rowing machine at home that I'd like to keep using. So, what I'm wondering is   Should I? Or will it ruin things for SL? If it's not a problem, when should I do it? Inbetween the SL days or same day? Before or after?  "
1710,What should i do if I miss a 5x5 session?,"I just started doing the 5x5 Stronglifts workout.  I ended up missing my third workout because of some personally reasons.  What should I do?  Should I go ahead and work out the day after I missed, or should I just skip to Saturday?  I don't want to change my schedule though.    I work out Saturday, Monday, and Wednesday because those are my best days to do it, and I missed Wednesday this week. "
1711,"Can Cardio/strength training improve ""stamina"" for long study periods?","Not being a native speaker, I am not sure whether the word ""stamina"" is proper. I hope you understand what I mean.  My goal is to improve the stamina for study. I want to be spending more time on studying not being exhausted or losing concentration. It would be better if I can sleep less. Many people around me claim that I need to do exercise for that. I have no idea if that's true, but I'm going to try it anyway.  According to my understanding, roughly there are two types of exercise: cardio and strength training. And it seems that doing one type of exercise can cause a negative effect on the other. For instance, they say long distance running destroys your muscle.  I am going to try both running and weight training, and I want to know on which I should spend more time for my purpose. Is there any research on this topic? Or could you share your personal experience? "
1712,Strange mark on shoulders after squatting,"I was in the gym yesterday doing a relatively light session which included squatting on the smith machine. It was only about 130kg and I done about 3 sets of 8 reps.  I woke up this morning with an unusual red 'marks' along both of my shoulders.   Is this normal? Or am I doing something wrong whilst holding the bar? It wasn't bothering me at the time and I had a sponge roller thing wrapped around the bar.    The image hasn't done it any justice to be honest, it looks a lot worse to the naked eye! Sorry about the lack of rotation also!  I was just wondering what the cause was really, I'm not concerned about the marks as they aren't bothering me in the slightest, just wanted to know what was the physical reasoning behind them! "
1713,Jogging in 90 degree heat,"Went for a 5km jog at 4pm today in Cambodia (90 degree heat) and my girlfriend got muscle cramps the same as yesterday. She stopped and then went jogging at around 5pm with no problems.  Started to eat more salt due to the sweating like a pig at the end of it (englishman). My legs never feel that great either jogging in the heat, but i've got a bad back anyway.  Also, she's been jogging like this for awile now but got abit disheartened that she hasn't lost any weight (although she only weighs 50kgs). She's well pissed off about that.   I'm abit worried she's gonna pack it in, but i reckon she should just run abit later and she'll be fine.  Is the above normal? I thought we might just be a couple of lightweights but then today i read they banned distance running in Florida during the summer because of the heat so maybe we aint that bad.  Is there a limit one should run at certain temperatures for normal non athlete fokes like us?  Cheers "
1714,What exercise develops internal fortitude?,"What exercise builds your internal fortitude the best? the ability to mentally prepare you for life, exercise, encounters, etc.?  Is it weight lifting that gives you the physical strength and appearance? Extreme aerobic that gives you endurance and stamina?  If you had to choose, which would it be? "
1715,Are low carb protein shakes ok if youre not exercising?,"  Hi! My name is Shawna. Currebtly, im 270lbs and 5’4. I started low carb about a month ago and have been feeling great except I feel like crap after my breakfast - normally eggs and some kind of protein, so i thought maybe i could just have a low carb protein shake in the morning as a meal replacement. I dont know anything about protein shakes or bcaas. Obviously, im trying to lose weight and i dont wwnt wnything to impede my efforts. Im not currently working out st the moment as i wanted to get my diet under control then i planned on lifting only. Possibly walking a few miles on my treadmill. Will using this protein shake help me get close to my goals or no? My stomach just feels so quesy in the mornings and it sucks. I feel like a shake would coat my stomach and really help. Opinion? Thoughts?  "
1716,How much rest time is necessary between intense cardio sessions?,"I've often heard it recommended to allow for an ""off day"" between strength training a specific muscle group to give it time to recover, and thus grow stronger. However, I haven't heard the same for aerobic exercise.  Cardio strengthens the heart, which is a muscle, so shouldn't the same recommended rest period apply?  Or, is it safe and effective to perform intense cardio every day? "
1717,Precise speed measuring gadget with low speed limit?,"I am used to run a lot. All the time outdoors rather than on a treadmill. Therefore, speed control is a little harder in my case.   I realized that my speed is far from being great, so I want to work on improving it. Of course, I can try and control it in general by pushing myself to run faster. However as another way to put more control of the speed would be some gadget that can accurately measure current speed, and, provide a low limit setting so that if my current speed falls lower that this limit it will notify me by beeping (for example). My question is if there is such a gadget that people use?  PS: There are mobile apps that ""measure"" your speed, but that number shown is an average on some interval of distance since all of them just use GPS for distance tracking and divide that distance by time interval between measurements. So mobile applications or GPS trackers are pretty much out of the question here as they won't be able to notify me immediately on speed being too low.  PPS: Have anyone tried Polar Footpod for this purpose?  "
1718,Is it worth buying caffeine pills to increase performance?,"I don't drink coffee at all, and I don't have the tools nor the time to make it. Not to mention it's hard to drink so many cups of coffee in a day to get it's benefits. So I was thinking about getting the supplement instead.  My question is:   Is it worth it to buy and take the caffeine pills (supplement) that are out there to increase overall performance ? ( increased metabolism, brain alertness, fat loss and muscle growth factors) Is it safe to take it on a daily basis, without getting any side effects? like 1 pill in the morning and 1 in the afternoon/evening before workout   "
1719,My right arm is weaker than the left one,"After 4 months of muscle-building exercises, I have started to see some results. What I've noticed is that my right arm is much weaker than the left one. When I do shoulder exercises, I hardly finish four series on my right arm, but it's easy for left one.  What should I do? When exercising my biceps, should I use heavier dumbbells for my right arm to make it stronger? "
1720,Should seated leg press be avoided?,"Should seated leg press be avoided?  [website]  Unless you're an 86-year-old grandmother rehabilitating a total knee replacement or Brach Warren working on showcasing another vein through his left VMO, you have no business on the seated leg press. It simply hurts people!      These are not the type of injuries that people get over in a few days.   The leg press has the ability to cause massive structural damage to   the spine that's likely to haunt your functionality for the remainder   of your skinny-legged life      Let's break down the mechanics of this movement from a practical   standpoint.      The seated position, more specifically the 45-degree seated position,   places the lumbar spine in a forward flexing position before your legs   even begin pushing through that torturous 8-inch range of motion. This   is the equivalent position to squatting with your chest facing the   ground – I wouldn't recommend it if you want to remain ambulatory.      The accentuated deep flexion of the hip joints not only causes some   heavy compressional forces shooting through the hips that cause joint   irritation and degradation, but it also causes a dysfunctional   compensation pattern in the lumbar spine, bringing it into further   flexion as each segment buckles. Remember, this piss poor posture is   just in the setup!      Adding a dynamic component to this setup is where this exercise   becomes downright outrageous. Sure it's easy for some uncertified   newbie personal trainer to program it because you just sit and push,   similar to a bathroom break in the office.      The simplicity of this movement is what keeps it continually being   brought back to life in an industry of alleged experts that are just   as confused as the clients they're being paid to coach. The simplistic   nature of little-to-no stability throughout the spinal column and hips   is what intrinsically makes this the most debilitating exercise in the   gym.      Bottom line, protecting the spine must be a primary focus at all times   during any activity, not just weight training. The seated leg press   not only lacks the ability to protect the spine, but also flaunts an   unstable, maximally loaded nature that's a powder keg waiting to blow.   Does this mean that no matter what precautions and position we take when using seated leg pres,s one always incurs the risk of low back injuries?  "
1721,Is stretching bad for building muscles?,"I want to get a better mobility and flexibility. Therefore, I am going to start stretching several times a week. However, I don't want to get super skinny because of it. Does the stretching have negative influences on building muscles? Will I lose muscles because of too much stretching? I am a little afraid that could happen. Is my fear justified or am I worrying too much? "
1722,Is there any disadvantage in Mixing Excercises?,"I done two sets of  SEATED OVERHEAD DUMBBELL EXTENSION....  Now before completing third set, can i do one set of Incline Barbell Triceps Extension....  than again doing third set of SEATED OVERHEAD DUMBBELL EXTENSION....  example :   2 sets of SEATED OVERHEAD DUMBBELL EXTENSION 1 set of Incline Barbell Triceps Extension 1 set of SEATED OVERHEAD DUMBBELL EXTENSION 2 sets of Incline Barbell Triceps Extension   Also if i do 6 type of triceps excercises [ say excercises names as a, b ,c , d, e , f ] , is i need to follow in orderwise ?  or is it fine to follow random order [ d , b , f, c , e, a ] but at the end of day, i will complete all 6 excercises ?

1723,Exercises that can replace squats?,"I've got a friend that's somewhat interested in doing Stronglifts, but for personal reasons she's utterly terrified of tearing up her knees from doing squats.  I've tried to convince her otherwise but to no avail.  Is there another exercise, or group of exercises, that can replace a squat?  Or even a modified squat that's a lot easier on the knees? "
1724,"Tricep extensions, stand up or lie down?","When performing tricep extensions, is it better to be lying flat on a bench or standing upright?  Is there pros / cons that support either case?  I usually perform them with both hands simultaneously, holding a plate, if that makes any difference.  "
1725,Improve ankle dorsiflexion for full squat,"I've been trying to do a full squat, heels on the ground, for a while.  It's become apparent that my ankle dorsiflexion is the weak link in the chain - my hip mobility is good, thigh strength OK, back strength and flexibility is fine, but I have trouble getting my knees far enough past my toes.  The best exercise I've found is to stand on one leg and bend my knee as far forward as it can go, loading the ankle tissues.  About half the time, I can feel a stretch there, but the other half of the time, it feels like nothing is happening.    I've tried propping the ball of my foot up and doing the same stretch, with slightly better results but nothing feeling as predictable as, say, the stretch when touching my toes.  When I try the classic calf stretch (lean against a wall, one leg forward, one back) I only feel things happening in my calves, which is great but it feels like it's not working the ankle much.  So, one and a half questions here - is that calf stretch actually working ankle dorsiflexion more than I think?  And, are there any other ways for aggressively targeting ankle dorsiflexion (bands, rolling...)?  "
1726,Working out arms twice a day,"I guess working out the same muscle group twice a day may be a bad idea since it needs rest, but what about arms, considering they repair a lot faster?  Currently I can do only 5-6 pull ups and my arms tire way faster than when I feel it in my back or something.  So would training just pull ups, in addition to my regular morning workouts, in the evening be better than training once a day or every other day? Perhaps, I can try to fit a nap during the afternoon. "
1727,Pavel Tsatsouline StrongFirst program and endorsing kettlebells and bodyweight,"Isn't it a contradiction to aim for increasing strength first, and then ,focusing on kettlebells and bodyweight exercises?   Wouldn't the first imply that you should be using heavy (or heavier) weights? Kettlebells and bodyweight seem to be to be fine for endurance training. Maybe they are useful for beginning with very poor form.   But I can't see how you could avoid reaching a plateau pretty soon, if you are planning to get stronger.  Am I wrong here in assuming that it's difficult to make kettlebell and bodyweight exercises progressively challenging? "

1729,How does one reduce heart rate through physical fitness?,"I watched an episode of ""Fight Science"" on National Geographic Channel which shows an elite soldier being able to sustain high combat performance in a low oxygen environment. This soldier is tested to have a lower resting heart rate than an average human being.  How does one train to achieve a low heart rate like that of an elite soldier? Does such training enables one to control the heart rate to the extend of feigning death? "
1730,Is it possible to lose muscle mass by going to the gym while in the middle of a calorie deficit?,"I'm a 25 year old male weighting about 165 Lbs. I'm trying to lose some body fat, but I'm still going to the gym 4 days a week to prevent as much muscle mass loss as possible.  I'm consuming slightly more than a gram of protein per Lb of body weight, but I'm concerned that this protein might be going to waste because the body might not have the calories to properly repair muscle after a workout, resulting in a net muscle loss. I'm currently consuming about 2,000 calories on workout days, and about 1200 calories on rest days, for an average of about 1,800 calories a day.  Is it at all possible to lose muscle like this? Does my concern have any grounds? If so, how can I prevent it? Fat loss is my priority right now, but I want to lose as little muscle as possible. "
1731,Control weight while preparing for triathlons,"I have a BMI of approximately 25 (87kg, 1.87m), which is just about where I want to be (I look too skinny if I'm lighter).   As this is the weight I've been for quite some time, I consider this to be OK for a relatively flat Ironman 70.3 race. Obviously, I'm not trying to win it, my goal is 5:30 for that one.   However, I have an extremely hilly Ironman 70.3 race one month later (2600 m elevation on the bike leg, and 1100 m elevation on the run). In order to get an OK time there, I would need to lose some weight, maybe as much as 5 kg. The power to weight ratio is obviously quite important here. (If I can finish at around 8 hours on this one I'm super happy).  How should I proceed, in order to get the best possible results on both? I would prefer to keep my weight until the first race, but I'm not sure that's a good idea. I guess I would lose a lot of muscle mass in my legs and thighs if I lose more than 3 kilos in only one month?   Any suggestions / help would be greatly appreciated! "

1733,Can someone help me design a routine given these constraints? (small apartment gym),"I don't have a car and the nearest gym is quite a distance away and costs 80 dollar each month. I'd prefer to use the apartment gym (which is a 30 second walk away and 'free') if possible!  Here's what it has:   Treadmills Stairmaster 2 benches (but no barbells) Dumbbells up to 50 pounds Ab wheel A life fitness dual adjustable cable machine (basically a chinup bar, dip bar, and 2 cables with adjustable weight)   Also, it's often completely empty so I can do circuit stuff pretty easily.  Here's some of the exercises that are recommended on the cable machine (but I'm not really sure which of these are actually worth incorporating)  Currently what I'm doing is a mix of the following (workout full-body 3 days per week):   Weighted chinups/pullups/dips Bulgarian split squats Stairmaster for HIIT Cable lat pull down Cable crossover Cable bicep curls Pushups Hollow body crunches/ab wheel   One problem I'm having is that I'd like to be able to add weight to certain exercises, but I'm not sure how. Like, it's easy to stick a dumbbell between my legs for chinups and dips, but how would I do that for pushups? I guess I just have to buy a vest for that?  Also, I worry about scaling exercises. Once I get past 50 pound dumbbells in each hand for exercises like the overhead press and split squat, then what?  Lastly, I'm not sure what I'm neglecting. Are there any exercises you all think I should really add or take away for a more comprehensive workout? "
1734,Better mood even after only 15 min of morning exercise - is this placebo or real effect?,I noticed that even only 10-15 min of morning exercise at 130 BPM has a positive effect on my mood.   Would that make sense from a biological point of view ?  Or is this more likely to be just placebo effect ?   Is 10-15 min not too short to have any effect on mood ?  Related link: [website]
1735,Are you losing fat or fluids if you diet and drink alot?,"A friend is on an extreme diet that includes acupuncture (amongst other) - his diet is that 2 days he isn't eating anything (literally) and the rest he eats very little - up to twice a day, 1 portion chicken, 1 yogurt etc - He can drink (and should) drink every day - he claims he drinks as many as 3+ liters of water a day - and still lost 6 kilos in the past 2 weeks.  My question: Did he lose fluids? or actual fat? (carb->>energy etc.etc.)  If you drink so much a day, and still lose weight, is that also fluid drop?  p.s. - he is not a tall person, and original weight is 110Ks. (more a chubby person than fat)  He did lose 2 belt holes, and looks thinner in his face.  EDIT sep-16-2012: Not sure why you think this Q is off topic, but I will still update: Current loss weight stands at 9KG - He still holds this formula. I think he will 'lose' all that he lost once he starts living though. "
1736,Is it better to develop swimming fitness first or get better at technique?,Some say; you have to get better at your swimming technique before swimming longer distances. But others (minority) suggest that you have to develop swimming fitness before worrying about technique? Which is the right way to start? 
1737,Is there any benefit to being more flexible than is necessary to reach position?,"Klokov posted a video on youtube a while ago showing his flexibility during warmup.  He's obviously much more flexible than is necessary to reach a snatch position.  Does this degree of flexibility have any translation to strength and power?  If so, what are the physiological justifications for this?  Is there more ""room"" for muscle fibers, or something like that? "
1738,Non-prick glucose meter,"Does anyone know of a way to test blood glucose without a pinprick? I'm open to commercial products (perhaps optical?) or ways to estimate it based on other observable factors. I'm not diabetic, so I don't need the accuracy that a normal glucose meter offers.    Some background to put this question in the context of fitness: Blood glucose, while usually considered in the context of diabetes, is directly correlated to insulin efficiency - or in too many cases, insulin resistance (inefficiency). Because insulin is the primary mechanism by which fat is stored, I don't believe it is possible to design an effective long-term weight management strategy without accounting for your own body's utilization of insulin. This is the hormonal basis of low-carb diets, slow-carb diets, etc.   I believe that, combined with detailed logs of sleep, diet, and exercise, measuring blood glucose on a frequent basis can provide information that will help to understand the impact on my personal physiology of these activities as they pertain to weight management; it's another tool to be used in conjunction with the scale and the measuring tape. "
1739,Is there a relation between muscle soreness and muscle progress?,"If I understand muscle training theory correctly, you put stress on your muscles, often times going as far as microscopically tearing the muscles up, and then expect the recovery process to make you stronger. Please excuse the gross oversimplification.  Muscle fibre tears can result in pain, otherwise known as Delayed Onset Muscle Soreness. More stress results in more tears, and more pain.  Would there be a relation between the amount of stress put on a muscle and the physiological reaction that rebuilds the muscle stronger afterwards? In other words, when I feel great soreness, should tell myself ""well, this is a good sign"", or rather ""oh grief, I've gone too far""? "
1740,Can't run for more than ~1700 ft,"So I'm trying to get into better shape, who isn't? And from what I've seen, some combination of aerobic training and weight training is the best way to do it, exercise-wise. Also, from what I've read on some articles([website]My question is:  I simply cannot run. The last time I tried running(more like jogging really), it went fine for the first 1/4~1/3 of a mile, then my body just sort of gave up, I started coughing up copious amounts of mucus, which eventually changed to include blood after a few minutes, and could barely breathe. Is that normal(I have very mild asthma)? That sort of thing never happens except for when I'm suffering from some respiratory illness, or am trying to run. The only ""standard"" I have to go on is that about 80% of the people I talk with talk about how they go on daily runs of about 2 mi, and how my school is trying to ""conscript"" everyone to take part in a 5 km run, and no one else seems to have this problem with it. Needless to say, 5 km and 2 mi are both well above 1700 ft. I can, however, bike, at about 11-12 mph I think. I think the longest ride I've been on biking was around 24 mi, and there was no problem there.  tl;dr: Is it normal/worrisome that I potentially cough up blood after running what seems to be a very short distance? If not, how can I remedy that? And can biking at what's apparently a pretty slow speed(at least compared to what I can find on Google) going to have the same sorts of effects on health/fitness as running can, or am I just pretty much screwed as far as getting those effects goes?  EDIT: Just a note about my biking speed, that 11.3 mph or so is from an app I have installed on my phone that acts as a pedometer designed for running and biking. When I bike, however, I do so on roads which are fairly smooth, but there is often traffic. My bike is a refurbished Raleigh from the 1950's, if I'm not mistaken, so it's very light and pretty well-constructed, but doesn't have the thinnest tires known to man. Also when I bike, there's traffic and intersections, and I'm not sure if the app calculates the waiting time for automobile traffic in its speed calculation, so I honestly don't know if my speed is remotely OK or not.

1741,Yoga for tight hip flexors,"I do have tight hip flexors &amp; so have hyperlordosis. I have been doing many standing yoga poses (like warrior - 1\2\3 half moon pose, triangle pose) for last 2-3 months, but progress is very slow. How much time does hip flexors take to gain flexibility? I do have this tightness on left side only.  Or is it some other thigh muscle, which is causing hip flexor to loose flexibility.  Is there any better way to understand anatomy? Is there any software which simulates muscle movements in a particular yoga pose..?  I do sit for long as my job demands. "
1742,"I'm trying to build mass, and I had a great upper body workout yesterday, but I only got about an hour and a half of sleep last night","Does this completely negate my workout?

1743,What causes a greater rate of calorie burn during an activity?,"What causes more calories are burnt per min during an activity? Is there a list of all major factors? Ideally answers should be scientifically proved or backed but if not then just a list / ideas what it could be is fine. (Just for clarity, by activity I don't mean, e.g., eating but an exercise like walking, running, bike, gym, ... .)  I'd assume the biggest (or only ?) factor is increased heartbeat that an activity causes.  If there are more factors than this then what is the ratio that they contribute to calories burn per unit of time? "
1744,Number of reps for lean muscles,"I am lady, mid- 30s and am lifting 8lbs weights doing simple exercises found on Pinterest. I'd like to get lean, beautiful muscles.  So far, I do 4 reps, 2 sets.   What is best number of sets to accomplish this? Is 2 ok, or should it be 3 sets?  Also I have 10lbs weights and I am thinking to use 8lbs on first set and 10lbs on second set.  How is this overall approach?  UPDATE  Trying to build strong muscle, endurance, while loosing flab, especially the abs. "
1745,How to train to make the most out of only 90 minutes of training per week?,"Once I'm asking a question on behalf of someone else who isn't comfortable to write on an English site:  My wife wants to get in shape, i.e. lose some fat, gain some muscle, increase stamina, increase overall fitness.  Now there's a problem: She currently has only 90 minutes per week to go the gym, which is a lot less than normally required to get good results, but it's still better than doing nothing.  My question is: How to make the most out of these 90 minutes in the gym?  There are some obvious aspects, split training for example is out of the question.  But here are so many more aspects to this, where I'm not sure what's best here:   More cardio or more resistance training? Low or high weights? Low or high number of repetions? Ultra-slow or explosive movements? How often should the workout routine be changed?  Other aspects I'm not aware of?   There's tons of information on these aspects on the internet and on this site, but all in context of multiple training sessions per week, which I apply on my own training sessions (3-4 times a week) but I'm not sure how they apply to a single and mostly isolated workout session. "
1746,Weight change with adaptive metabolism,"My goal was to gain muscle from 165lbs to 180lbs. I started tracking calories and macros, aiming for 1g fat per lb and 1.5g protein per pound as minimums, filling up my calories any way beyond that.   I started at about 3000 calories a day and over a month gained 5 pounds to put me at 170, but then the weight gain stopped so I increased my intake first to 3500 and now to 4000  I've been eating in excess of 4000 calories a day for two weeks now and I can't seem to move the needle any further. I have so much energy all day from the food and feel fantastic, but I can't seem to convert that into gains.   If weight change is truly just calories in vs calories out, how do I tip the scale so that my increased energy from increased intake doesn't just burn off and leave me at net zero?   Is it safe/reasonable to just keep consuming more?  "
1747,Took a 6 week break from Stronglifts. Now what,"After taking a 6-8 week break from Stronglifts, what is the appropriate way to get back into it?  Here is my issue, I was incredibly faithful to going to the gym 3 times per week for about three months. I progressed on Stronglifts (starting at suggested minimums) without stalling on anything except for overhead press.   Right around three months into it, my wife got sick, followed by my kids getting sick, followed by a road trip with friends, etc. All in all, I have missed six weeks of going to the gym and it may be eight weeks by the time Christmas passes.   How should I handle this? I do not want to injure myself but would prefer not to start at the beginning?   Should I switch to something like starting strength since (I believe) that allows you to start at something above minimum? Or should I just progress more quickly on stronglifts? Or something else?  Thank you for all your help!  P.S. Related question here (I feel mine is different because I really missed a significant amount of time): How to handle a break from StrongLifts? "
1748,Should rep range be determined by muscle fiber composition?,"There are many people, including Arnold Schwarzenegger and Hodge Twins, who say that endurance and stabilizer muscles should be worked out at high rep ranges (16+) for optimal hypertrophy. Their theory is that these type of muscles, for example legs and abs, are composed mostly of type I fibers, so focusing on those fibers would be the most efficient way to increase overall size.   There's also a lot of other people who have the mantra that every muscle needs to be trained heavy in the 8-12 rep range. So who is right? "
1749,Why does one person have lots of stamina and another doesn't?,"I'm a bit of a couch potato with a sedentary job, who normally gets out of breath walking up a few flights of stairs. I recently walked up Snowdon in North Wales (10 mile round trip, 1100m summit, around 6 hours in total) which I found a struggle at times, being out of breath and my heart exploding out of my chest! There were people of all ages (6-90) passing me and not breaking a sweat.  Recently I saw an article on TV about an 82 year old guy who has been hill running for decades, and still goes out every day (often 20 miles a time).  I'm curious to know what makes him (and the walkers I saw) ""fit"" - where does his stamina comes from? He was stick thin like me, so I guess muscles don't play a huge role in it. I can only assume it's down to heart and lung efficiency? "
1750,Is it okay to continue workouts while fasting?,"I'm fasting (water only) for an undetermined amount of time (7-14 days) for personal reasons, but I want to continue my workouts so I don't fall out of the habit.  I'm afraid if I let myself skip them I won't restart right away, leading to months of inactivity - it's happened before!  Typically, I have 2-3 cardio workouts a week (30min to 1hr of running/cycling) and 2 weight lifting workouts (3x5 barbell squats, rows, et cetera)  What can I do to ensure safe workouts while I fast?  I'm considering modifying/cheating my fast to include milk on workout days, would this help with the weight lifting?  Or is this crazy and I should take a break from the exercise, too? "
1751,Strategy for Max Heart Rate Hit when Running,"I am a 51 year old non-competitive guy trying to run triathlons to stay healthy.  The formulas say my max heart rate should be around 170, and despite the myths, I think that number is good for me.  When I hit that rate, things start to get uncomfortable.    Given that I am doing this for health, and I am non-competitive honoring that 170 mark is right for me.  So If I hit the 170 (I have an alert on my Garmin) what should I do?  Mostly I hit this on the run.  I do not worry about it too much on the bike as there are few hills where I ride.  Currently my plan is to, when I hit 170, to slow down to a ""lineman's shuffle"", that is run like a 16:00/mile pace, just over a walk.  I do this until my heart rate is down below 155, around 85% of max.  After that I can pick up the pace again.    Does that sound like a good plan?    "
1752,Should I get rid of my office chair ?,"Do a quick google search on ""8 hours a day"" and you'll find search results that pretty much say that sitting is literally going to kill you. The desk we have at work are adjustable to different heights, and a colleague just got rid of his desk and now stands all day.   Is this a good idea ? What are the potential benefits ? Has anyone on here tried it ?  "
1753,"Is 10,10,10 as good as 30?","My problem: For aerobic exercise, my target heart rate is 120. I aim to exercise at that level for say 30 minutes per day.  Now, if I ""walk as hard as possible"" I only get to about 100, 105.  Unfortunately I'm just too old, fat, and my knees are too weak, for now, to actually jog or run.  Solution: very fortunately there's a perfect hill near me: at a strong walk, it produces 120 bpm.  Fantastic. I am so lucky about that hill!  Problem: from the bottom to the top, it's about 13, 14 minutes.  Now, I amble down the hill in around 6-7 minutes, with my heartrate down to perhaps 100, 105.  So as you can see, my regime there is along the lines:  at 120: 13 minutes at 100: 7 minutes at 120: 13 minutes at 100: 7 minutes at 120: 13 minutes at 100: 7 minutes    (either two or three ""laps"" thereof).  So, I certainly get a wonderful 20 or 30 mins at 120 bpm -- BUT interrupted by easy-going doddles at around 100/105.  My question, does sport science have anything to say about this?  Am I completely wasting my time, is there no beneficial effect from ""10, 10, 10"" minutes (with pleasant pauses in between) compared to 30 minutes?  I'm sure you understand me --- What do you experts think?  That's the question in a nutshell. Thanks!!!!!!!!! "
1754,Why does my look differ so much after the gym?,"I'm a (very dedicated) beginner lifter (1,5-year experience) Since the start of my fitness adventure, I gained a good deal of muscles while staying relatively lean. I'm currently 71kg (156 lbs) at 178cm (5'10) and used to be 63kg (138 lbs) when I started.  I can notice an immense difference in my physique during the training, however after the workout when the pump lowers down I look basically almost the same as I used to. I noticed that I grow much more significantly than the rest of the people at the gym, but they have better day to day looks.  Is it possible to be a muscle equivalent of ""grower not a shower""? Is that genetic, or can it be worked on as well? "
1755,Does Exercise Decrease or Increase testosterone?,"So when I exercise does it use up my testosterone, does it produce more? or none of the above. How do I use my testosterone storage and kinds of things can decrease it? "
1756,What's so bad about losing more than 2lbs/wk,I keep reading that the guideline to shoot for is a max of two pounds a week for weight loss. Why?    You see these folks on TV being driven to loose 10lbs a week. Is it just the fact they are so obese that they can handle that sort of crazy drop in weight for the short term but will flatten out once they get down to a more 'normal' BMI? Or are they doing some serious danger to themselves? 
1757,Is doing the whole rep range from 3 to 15 reps before adding weight a waste of time?,"I start every exercise with 3 sets of 3 reps, then I add between 1 and 3 reps each workout, so that it takes me very long to achieve 3 sets of 15 reps. Then I increase the load and start again with 3 reps.  The rationale behind this is maximizing safety, avoiding tendinitis and other possible injuries. After I spent more than a year recovering from a painful shoulder surgery, I decided I would do my best to avoid a similar situation in the future.  The thing is, I am not sure if I am wasting my time, of if the high rep range is at all safer. I get sometimes pretty sore even when I am close to the high-rep range of each cycle.  The goal is strength, but I cannot work always in the low rep range because I am 42 yr and prone to overuse injuries. I must somehow cycle between low and higher reps, but, isn't it going up to 15 reps too much?  Remark  From Dave's answer I understand that it might be a good idea to implement some short of microcycles, so that I alternate more often between the strength and endurance ends of the rep spectrum. I have posted a new question on how to implement that specifically in my case. But I still hope for other possible approches here (e.g., leaving the cycle from 3 to 15 reps as it is now but reducing the number of sets close to the high end?) "
1758,"What is the best break timeframe between muscle building workouts, and is it ok to do cardio?","I hear multiple different people say multiple different things on the question, some people say no cardio on rest... but some people say its okay  My current routine is :    Monday : Upper Body  Tuesday : Cardio (Swimming)  Wednesday : Core  Thursday : Cardio (Swimming)  Friday : Legs  Saturday : Rest  Sunday : Rest    Is the gap in-between those muscle building days ok?

1759,I started weightlifting more seriously and now my shoulders are popping,"I've had small stints of weightlifting my entire life, but recently I've tried to get more serious about it. I started taking supplements, I added more routines, I started following recommended lift patterns (5 day split), but about 4 days ago my shoulders started popping when I lift my arms (while just doing normal things with nothing in-hand) and it's disturbing me.  Both shoulders do it, but the right one does it much more readily and frequently. I wouldn't say there is true pain when it pops, but there is a small amount of discomfort (it's possible it's just mental discomfort at the idea of it though, I'm not positive).  The upper body lifts I do are: weighted pushups, chest dumbbell flies, pull ups (with various grips), standing curls, over-the-head tricep lift (one dumbbell), dumbbell laterals, and military press (dumbbells).  The possible culprits: I read that doing military press behind the head can cause problems, so I did switch to trying to do them in front of my head, but I had been doing them a few weeks above/behind the head before reading that. Also, I don't have a bench so I do the chest flies on the floor which causes my shoulder to pop sometimes because of the pressure against the floor. Also the last time I did laterals my shoulder was popping as I came up. (I might go too high with my laterals?). But who knows maybe it's the over-the-head triceps or the pushups that are doing it. I have no idea.  I stopped lifting all together when it started happening 4 days ago to see if it would heal/fix. I also started taking ibuprofen to help with inflammation and  tried to make sure i was sleeping with my arms at my sides instead of above my head in case it was the way I was sleeping. But it's still popping.  Does anyone have any tips on how I can either fix my shoulder or make sure the exercises I'm doing aren't making it worse? Really don't want arthritis later in life... "
1760,Slow digested meals while keep eating,"I'm not sure if this is the correct site to ask this  Let's say that I take a casein protein shake in the morning let's say 8 am, this will be slowly digested so I will have nutrients during several hours  I have a medium-fast metabolism  So the casein shake it's supposed to last for 8 hours  So I take my second breakfast at 10 and then my lunch at 12  So by the time I have my second breakfast and lunch the casein protein is supposed to be in the process to be digested  So what happens?  Does my body need to wait until the casein protein is fully digested to be able to digest something else?   or   Does my body can start digesting my breakfast and lunch like at the same time while the casein protein is till being digested?  In other words does digestion work like a Queue in such a way that it has to digest the first meal before digesting the next meal or can it be digested in parallel  (Yeah I'm a geek developer jaja)  I'm asking this because since I'm taking the casein protein in the morning I feel less hungry than before and this scares me because I feel I wouldn't be able to reach my calories goal "

1762,Why is the heart the only muscle that needs to be trained multiple times a week to see major improvement?,"Basically the title. If I go to the gym three times a week, I can hit different muscles each time (meaning each muscle is really only being targeted once) and I'll see noticeable muscle growth over time.  If I run once a week, though, my heart won't improve in any meaningful way. I couldn't run once a week for 20 years and be ready to run a marathon, but I could hit each muscle once a week for 20 years and be a legitimate bodybuilding competitor.  What's the difference? Why is there no way to do one cardio exercise a week and see significant improvement? "
1763,I want to grow taller?,"I'm 15 years old and only 5'2 and about 47kg. I can't help it anymore and I really want to get taller, as I hate seeing my friends grow to about 6'0 and i stay shorter as if i'm their kid. My dad is 5'9 and my mum is about 5'4-5'5, and i believe that i can grow taller due to my parents genetics, however it doesnt seem to make any difference as i havent nearly grown any taller in the past year. I eat all my vitamins and eat healthy and sleep for about 8 hours every night however i can see no difference. I train and exercise a lot and everyday, i do about 30 minutes jogging everyday, does this have anything to do with it? maybe too much training is stunting my growth? I also take a multi-vitamin pill everyday to help me be healthy and grow. My wrist is actually really small and skinny, does this have anything to do with it? last year i was 5'2 and i'm still 5'2 this year, just maybe slightly taller. Thanks a lot and i would be very happy with your help and guidance about what i should do to grow taller.     How many calories a day should i eat? "
1764,How does alcohol really affect gains?,"I have been training with a personal trainer now for about a year; we work four days a week (Monday, Tuesday, Thursday and Friday) and do bodybuilding splits. So, we do dynamic lower core, heavy upper, heavy core, and then high-rep dynamic upper again. I have definitely seen some gains in a year; I was about 315 or so and and now am about 255 lbs. and have gone from 29.9 % body fat to about 17% or so now and have gained about 13 pounds of lean muscle. I just can't seem to get to that new plateau and my trainer tells me it's all about diet now to push past the next hurdle. Basically he told me up my clean proteins during the day and do lots of veggies and fruits. Of course we do carbs around the workout and in the morning in general.  I have since started doing that but the problem is that I like my drink. Not saying that I'm pounding a six pack every night but I do enjoy 1-2 glasses of wine pretty regularly or go out for a beer after work with my friends or whatever. I like to have a good time but I'm being told this is probably the reason why I can't shave off the last few percentage points off my body. My trainer has said that alcohol cranks up estrogen, blocks protein synthesis, and also can stop fat burning for up to three days because of acetate metabolism or something. Is this true? Has anyone had an experience where alcohol has hindered their gains? If I have to quit I will but I have to admit it will be a sad day! "
1765,Max Energy for Performance,"Not taking into account any supplements like BCAAs, caffeine, etc, how can I best optimize myself for solid energy for 1-1.5 hours of a workout, whether weight training or cardio or a mix of the two?  I understand carbs give energy, simple for quick and complex for more sustainable, but I have a hard time either with timing or digestion.   Any recommendations for how to fuel myself during the day and prepare for a workout based solely on food intake and timing? Especially when the aim is to ""cut"" and opting to reduce total calories?  "
1766,Climbing stairs up to 8 story to reduce weight?,"Well. Now i have put on a lot. I used to be 65 Kg. Three years back. But now i am 95 Kg. i do not have much time for exercise. I have started in taking healthy food. which includes Vegetables, milk, Oats, multi grain stuff etc.   Moreover i am climbing stairs from ground floor to 8th floor up and down twice a day.  Will this practice reduce my weight ?  Also should i avoid climbing stairs after having lunch ? "
1767,How can women live without Testosterone,I read that men experience degraded fitness under testosterone deficiency. There are ways to support it in norm. But what about the woman. How can they stay so vivid at much lower testosterone levels? Do they have different (muscle/brain) tissue responsiveness to the testosterone? 
1768,Long period one time training or divide it into two times a day,"I usually train 4 times a week, and for each day, I usually do 1 hour weight training + 30 mins HIIT cardio running training. For other days I simplely do some light running or swimming.  I did my best to keep up with this training plan for 2 months, but I feel really tired about it, especially the 30 mins HIIT cardio after 1 hour weight training is really killing me. Sometimes (most of time) I have to move this 30 mins HIIT cardio before my weight training so I can do them both. But my friend tells me that doing cardio first is such a big mistake, it can not burn your fat, and it will affect my weight training. So I am thinking sth else.  Now I am thinking to put part of my cardio to the morning time right after I weak up. (I train at 5:30pm-7:00pm before). That is, I will do 15mins HIIT running + 10 mins usual running at morning right after I weak up and 1 hour weight training + 12 mins HIIT running at afternoon.   Do you guys think this strategy is sound? Or am I making another mistake?  Thank you!   PS: I am 180cm tall and 167lbs with Body Fat Index 15% (according to the ""smart"" weight scale I bought from amazon, who knows it is accurate or not...). So I still want to lose some fat.  PPS: I was 187 pounds 3 months ago and I am 167 now. So my old training plan does it job for me and I am happy. But now I just wish to change a little bit. :) "
1769,Red meat cancer risk after removing adipositas cancer risk,"While reading a lot of uncited or badly cited popular science literature, I came across the claim that consuming red meat increases the risk of cancer. Said literature also claims in seemingly unrelated articles that being fat increases the risk of cancer. It's not really a long shot to presume that people who overindulge on red meat might also be fat. And it might be quite reasonable to presume that a lot of these people also eat too much acrylamide through the fries served with the red meat.  Is there any scientific evidence that states that a lean athlete who consumes red meat regularly, as a good source of lean protein, increases his risk of cancer? Maybe some kind of study that compares highly physical active people against the general population? "
1770,Variation of pushups for bicep work out,"Is it possible to use the pushups as biceps workout by changing the position of hands? I searched the net for bicep pushups and tried it. I don't know about my biceps but my wrists were very sore. Is it because the bicep muscle is used to turn the wrists? However, I am not sure if I used the correct method. Can someone explain the correct method or provide some reliable link?  "
1771,Inner elbow pain: Golfer's elbow or something else,"For the past few months I've been dealing with inner elbow and forearm pain that is brought on by pulling movements. My physio diagnosed me with  Golfer's elbow and has had me doing exercises to fix it for the past month. Since doing the exercises, the pain hasn't gotten better, which has made me start to think that my pain could be from something other than Golfer's elbow.

1773,Effect of Sex/Male Orgasm on Athletic Performance,"""Women weaken legs."" -- Mickey from Rocky I  I've often heard and have been told from coaches even that one should abstain from any sexual activity, irrespective of whether it is manual or with a partner, before an athletic event.    Is there any physiological reason for this advice or if said advice is being given only so that the male athlete stays mentally focused.  Are there effects on testosterone levels that are significant enough to affect athletic performance?  Does sex really make your legs weak?  Is the effect of sex/orgasms on athletic performance even measurable due to other variables like nutrition, sleep, mood, etc. etc.? "
1774,Activity Tracker and Elliptical,"I own the Fitbit Force, and wanted to know if I were to wear it while running, elliptical or stairclimber does it convert the miles/floors to calories burnt?  If I were to also use runkeeper are the miles/calories double counted?  Also, If I manually enter in an activity and wear the Fitbit does it also double count the calories.  Just wanting to see if I should wear my fitbit while on the elliptical or other activities and just manually enter in data.  Thanx! "
1775,How to stay fit with lowest possible calorie burn?,"Suppose you were in a situation of restricted access to calories -- at or perhaps even below what you need to sustain your weight long-term -- but wanted to stay/get in the best shape possible under those circumstances.  (Hypothetical example: you're a captive prisoner-of-war, and are trying to maintain shape in case you have the opportunity to escape, but not starve as a result of exercising beyond your calorie allotment.)  What's the best exercise program you can design (with or without any equipment) that will keep or improve your strength, endurance, reflexes while consuming as few calories as possible so as not to hasten starvation?  Or is that basically impossible and your best bet is to conserve energy and hope for the best? "
1776,What physical endurance exercise can I fit into a 5-minute routine without any equipment?,"I want to get into exercise for my own personal well-being and fitness, and I don't want to do 'target' exercise (which I know doesn't work) but rather I want to improve my physical endurance so that I feel less tired during the day.   I would like to fit this into my morning routine, but I know that I occasionally oversleep, or have to prepare something before going to work, and sometimes I have as little as 5 minutes to try to squeeze in an exercise routine.  But I would like to do something regularly so that I can make it into a habit, with the goal of doing more as I improve.   What exercise routine can I fit into a 5-minute morning exercise to help improve my physical endurance?  Currently, I'm using sit-ups as my go-to exercise (cross-body, not arms behind the head) and considering adding push-ups too, but is there anything better?  Or something that could exercise parts of my body that sit-ups might miss?    Keep in mind I don't have any equipment, and my apartment space is very limited, plus I want to be able to do this routine even if I have to go away on a trip.   I plan on doing the same exercise in the evening as well, and to increase the time I do my exercise steadily as I improve, but to do that, I have to be able to fit a bare-minimum routine into my morning first.   "
1777,What cutting routine after Starting Strengh,"I did SS for around 5 months and have had pretty good success, although my BF% had gone up to 20% and I probably need to do a cut before I continue, or reboot SS.  Squat 50kg -&gt; 85kg Bench 50kg -&gt; 75kg Press 30kg -&gt; 45kg Deadlift 50kg -&gt; 110kg BW 70kg -&gt; 80kg   Towards the end of the program, I had injuries, lack of motivation, and stopped making gains in both body-weight and strength, so decided it was time for a change.  A lot of people (the SS crowd) suggest staying on SS while on a cut. I can't see this working without since I struggled even when trying to eat a calorie surplus....   I was going to start running 2x week and 1x heavy weights since this seems to be the middle ground. But that doesn't seem very common at all.  Is there an SS equivalently routine while cutting? Or any other really popular routines? Should I be lowering weights and increasing exercises, reps and sets??   Should I be looking at Madcow or Texas method since they tend to be high volume less increases? "
1778,What is the correct form for a deadlift?,"I asked my gym instructor to check my deadlift form last night and he said I was doing it wrong. According to him:   My hips were too low at the starting position - he says the hips should be as high as possible (the legs almost straight but not locked, remaining like this for the whole movement) The bar should not touch the floor Use a mixed grip   On the way down, I feel my hamstrings stretching because my legs are so straight doing it like this. (I'm not naturally flexible and its hard for me to touch my toes) All the effort in this movement seems to come from the lower back  Is he plain wrong, teaching me a different kind of deadlift, or correct?  What's the correct way to deadlift? "
1779,random unscheduled jogging?,"I have a question about running:  1- I do random sessions of jogging and athletic sports (sometimes at night, sometimes 5 sessions in a week, other times i go through a blank month) because i have engagements / work and it is hard for me to stick to a regular agenda for good, am I doing it vainly ? does it have side effects or is it somehow harmful ? "
1780,Stitch-like rib pain when (road) running,"I’ve been running fairly consistently for a couple of months recently, mainly because I move around a lot and this makes maintaining gym memberships etc quite difficult.  Prior to this I would road bike and weightlift fairly frequently.  Once I started running in earnest I rightly expected the first couple of weeks to be fairly miserable, so I took it fairly easy so as not to injure myself. Mainly doing up to 5k at a light pace. Over that period most of the initial aches and pains disappeared (foot and shin pain mostly, I’m quite a broad guy - 5’11” and about 100kgs).  However the only ‘ache I can’t shake’ is a recurring pain in my right hand side around my ribs. It feels like a stitch, a kind of stabbing pain, but its further up and sometimes radiates around to my back slightly. It starts about a kilometre in to the run. I’ve never really had this before in the gym no matter how heavy I’ve lifted, nor really when I run on the treadmill or cycle, even fairly extended distances.  I stretch before, during and after the run, and it will abate once I’ve stopped but it reoccurs every time I go running without fail. I’m now wondering if I should be more concerned about this? Has anyone had a similar experience?  Could it be my running form? I’m dominant right handed/footed. It’s annoying as it’s hampering my ability to improve my speed and distance. "
1781,Role of jogging/running in bodybuilding regime,"People have different opinions about running,jogging even walking. There are somethings I want myself to be cleared about which I looked out a lot but couldn't satisfy myself.   What time or days per week one should go for running with respect to evening workout schedule and for how long? Does too much running effects knees in the long run and do i need to be track specific like grass or roadside? Which exercise should be coordinated with workout after running? A silly one rather- Is milk enough to cope up with running or extra supplements are required to prevent knee wearing and tearing?  "
1782,How to do the 20-rep-Squat routine?,"My name is Malek and I have recently purchased a Squat Cage, Barbell, and Weights. I have done weight training before but have not in 7 months.I would truly like to get back into it. I have started a 20-rep-squat program and am wondering what weight should I start at.  I am 16 years old and 120lb. My squat 7-months ago was 225lbs. Will I still make good gains with this program if I start at 100lbs for 20 reps? Or is this too low?  Thank you for your consideration,  Malek "
1783,Am I lifting too much too fast?,"My goal is getting bigger muscles I am 6'4"" tall and 43 years old man  I have been training for a year now  When I look at the weights I lift compared to the other guys in the gym (the big muscles guys) I notice that I lift way more than they do.  they have much bigger muscles than I do, and they are younger but they don't lift as much as I do.  Am I going too much too fast?  Shall I reduce the weight and not push myself as hard I am now? "
1784,Theory and meaning of the Wilks score?,"The Wilks score is used to compare powerlifting scores for lifters of different body weights.  A coefficient                            500 Coeff = -----------------------------------------,          a + b*x + c*x^2 + d*x^3 + e*x^4 + f*x^5   depending on the body weight ""x"" of the lifter in kilograms is multiplied by his or her total to arrive at a sort of ""standardised"" score for comparison.  (It appears that it may also be used to compare individual lifts.)  There are specific (sex-dependent) values given in the linked article for a,b,c,d,e,f. Is there any online source explaining the theory behind the Wilks score?  The linked Wikipedia article does not explain where the denominator polynomial coefficients (a,b,c,d,e,f) come from and why the formula has the specific form given, and Google wasn't of much help.  The quintic polynomial (a+bx+cx2+dx3+ex4+fx5) appearing in the denominator has three real roots.  The negative root can be ignored as meaningless, and the two positive roots (roughly 13.5kg and 283kg) are presumably to be considered ""out of range"".  Thus, I would guess this formula was obtained by fitting some collection of data.  But what data?  Alternatively, perhaps there is a theoretical model explaining these coefficients?  (The only, admittedly crude, model I can think of is a multiplier very roughly like x-(2/3), which doesn't resemble the form given for Wilks, though the curves do have roughly the same overall shape on a sensible body-weight interval.)  There must be some published literature on this, but I could not find it. "
1785,Help me making my next training plan,"I finding good training for my own.  STATE: Started home traning a week ago. (daily 90 min of traning) I have not fixed training set for me yet. This period, only just doing as I can do. The first reason is I have no knowledge about how to make it. And second reason is to keep my interesting and sustainable. ordinary my training set is almost going like next.     3 set of Push-ups (1~3 normal, 3~5 kneeling, 10 on the wall is 1 set that is my limit)   Trying Leg Split Stretch. (from youtube teaching) 50~100 squats. And others (sit-up or plank, etc)       State is Age 33, Male, 1.85m height, 90kg weight, 26% fat, 64% muscles. And I haven't muscle training experience. My home training's target is to gain basic physical strength for 1 ~ 2 months. (I heard a saying, ""If you can't just a set of Push-ups or squat or other basics exercise with perfect position, don't do any other training except by that until you can do them 1 or more sets."") When I reach goal, I will going to health gym, or other training centers. So this question is about my future.  My Final Targets: The lowest number is most I want. If mutually exclusive two or more items, I can ignore highest number. 1) I want good body control. (I'm sorry for I don't define it precisionly. my knowledge is so low. Not tired of long time walking or stand-up, and durability for my work(sitting down always)) 2) I want good balance on my body. (I want feeling same power filled from my finger to my toe.) 3) I want agility and quickness. (I think my body is too heavy so I'm not good at outdoor activities with my friends) 4) I want cut my fat rate. (under 20%, up to 15%) 5) I want good shape (ex I want large chest and shoulder) 6) I want my weight to 80kg *I'm sorry for my wording is not great... But next question or writing will be better because I will have more knowledge ...  The Question. What is the best choose my after getting basic physical strength? 1) You are good now, progress home training that way. (In this case, recommending a lecture or youtube guide also helpful) 2) Going to health gym and telling your think to Personal Trainer. 3) Martial Arts is good for you (like jukido, Jiu-Jitsu) 4) Boxing 5) Swim 6) Pilates 7) Yoga 8) etc Actually the case is just exmaple, You can explain your way.    more thing My friends and online blogs said to me core muscle training (especially, inner-core) is good for you. but every saying of them has difference. So I very confused. for example, someone says plank is better than sit-up. But other one says just endure is not enough muscle stimulation for reinforce inner-core muscle. other example And someone says stomach vacuum is very good for directly train your transversus. But other one says more interest thing is balance between transversus and multifidus because your body can be twisted. For my short knowledge, I don't know who's say is more important. Is core muscle(inner core?) is really most import for that i want? Than who knows the professional knowledge and how to train it? All that thing is the things makes me confused so it makes me can't plan for next. So finally i write a question to this page.    Thank you for reading my question. "
1786,What is tabata? How effective is it?,What exactly is Tabata ? Is it just a form of HIIT ?  What makes Tabata effective in fat burning or providing thermogenic effects ? 
1787,When is isolating certain muscles beneficial?,"I have heard that isolation exercises are pointless by some, and that total body workouts are to be abided by. I must digress as, for example, what if supporting muscles are strikingly weak?  I have noticed with me personally that during squats I feel like I have to ""bounce"" a little fast on the bottom because my hamstrings seem to ""burn up"" and get sore/painful if I don't.  Some have said, ""Just do more squats!"", but it hasn't made all the difference. That's why I figured, what can be bad about routine isolation every now and then? Why do some trainers rarely isolate and do workouts in packed ""units"" of muscle groups, rather than tackle weaker areas directly? How is that harm?  Anyways, is isolation ""good"" in any sense, and would it benefit me in my insufficiently muscle-activated squats? "
1788,Ideal weight pursuing,"Long story short.  I've been exercising for 4 months (running 20 minutes/day and dumbbell lifting, both things 5-7 times per week) and I've lost 6kg (~13lb); I was pretty proud of the outcome (mainly because I wasn't expecting that much weight reduction for this light workout) but after checking my BMI I'm still right on the overweight border (24.9BMI) and still 6kg above my ideal weight.  So my questions are, in order to achieve my ideal weight:   Am I doing the right amount of exercise but I need more time?. I need to exercise more? Are my workout routines correct or there's something I need to change?   Details.  Excercise.  Starting four months ago:   Running routine: 20 minutes every day; at first it was 4 days per week (because I ran out of breath pretty easily) but now I'm doing 5-7 days per week and I'm starting to feel like 20 minutes is not long enough even sometimes (specially if the previous day I didn't run) I don't even break a sweat. Running hours aren't regular: whenever I go out to run I go at different time but in the 6PM-9PM range. After running, I'm lifting dumbbells, 200 Hammer Curls and 200 Floor press in alternating series of 25.   Lifestyle.  For the last 20 years:   I'm sitting almost all day long: at my workplace, in my car, at home. Messed up sleeping routine: 5-6h from Monday to Friday and 9-10h Saturday and Sunday. I've been having a daily alcohol intake, between 1-2 can of beer per day (I've reduced it to 1-2 cans of beer per week when I started to exercise). I didn't take any care of the kind of food I was eating, not even sticking to a time Schedule for my meals but for the last 2 years I reduced my meat intake switching it to legume; I still ocasionally eat meat, mainly chicken.   Weight and Height.  I reduced my weight in 6kg (~13lb) from 77kg to 71kg, I always take the measurements with light clothes and without shoes. Being my height 169cm my BMI is right on the limit of overweight.  I wasn't controlling my weight until the last 6 weeks so I don't know at what pace it was falling, but for the last weeks it was decreasing from 74kg to 71kg steadily, after reaching the 71kg mark I'm struggling to make it fall further.  I know that the BMI doesn't take into account the muscle/fat ratio and I've been told that fat is lighter tan muscle, but I seriously doubt that most of the weight I reduced became muscle.  My ideal weight seems to be on the 65kg mark, but it doesn't look like my body wants to hit that mark, so I'm wondering if that ""ideal weight"" is ideal at all, or maybe I just need to change my excercise routine or I might need more time to achieve the goal. I'm not looking for a six pack nor looking for a toned body, I just want to loose some weight. "
1789,How to keep a specific rhythm during sets?,"I would like to keep a consistent rhythm during  sets and reps (Like 4 seconds down, hold 1s, 4 s up, pause 1s).  Any tips for how to do this? What would ideal cues look/sound like? "
1790,What hydration system should I use for multiple activities?,"Looking for a hydration pack that I can use for riding, running, snowboarding and (by removing the bladder and putting it into my travel pack) backpacking across Europe.  My requirements are pretty simple:   Small 2L capacity (or around that mark) Light Minimal - no extra storage or other bells and whistles are necessary Reasonably strong/good quality   What do you recommend?  At this stage I'm interested in this bag by Deuter. "
1791,What is the difference between static stretching vs strengthening the antagonistic muscle?,"I was trying to learn more about healthy ways to deal with injuries and I think from this video by Athlean-X and this one from Mike they seem to imply that one should basically never statictically stretch. My understanding is taht when one applies a force (i.e. static stretching) then one is forcing the muscle to do something it wasn't able to do. Thus, if the muscle is tight it could tear. Since tight muscles are only caused by the antagonistic muscle being weak then we should always just strengthen the antagonistic muscle. This is my current understanding. However, I've heard physical therapist recommend static stretches. I always though all static stretches were not recommended. Which makes me think I have the wrong model of the role of:   static stretches strengthening muscle   If someone understands the role of these in injury prevention (or in injury recovery) that would be fantastic.   I am not looking to cure myself or anything, just understand why I am seeing different recommendations, if perhaps there is 1 time static stretches are recommended (and thats injury recovery), then I'd be curious to understand why just to form a consistent model of how all of this works. Right now I see contradicting information and can't reconcile it, probably due to my limited understanding of orthopedics, fitness or something. "
1792,Can you overtrain?,"This goes along with a prior question, what over-training signs to look for.  Is there such a thing as over-training? or is it that you injure yourself from lack of proper training and don't perform at peak because of bad planning? So, the question is, Is there such a thing as over training?  Related Article: Max Out on Squats Every Day "
1793,Building muscle on fat,"My first question is factual, while my second question is regarding myself.   Is it possible to build muscle on fat? That is, is it possible to build muscle (say ab muscles) underneath your already-existing fat without losing much of that fat during the process? I have heard people say that's a thing; also, I have seen some (really) overweight people at the gym lifting a lot of weights. To me, that was an example of building muscle on fat that hasn't been shed. On the other hand, I have read some articles saying this notion is a myth.  I myself suffer from a beer belly. To be clear, I do not drink; I have gained weight and my body has decided to store it all in my abdominal area---hence the beer belly. I'm exercising regularly now with focus on both cardio and weight lifting. For my abs, I do the medicine ball V-up and plank exercises. I can already feel my ab muscles getting harder and stronger, BUT, I also feel like my abdominal fat has also gotten stiffer. This might be a simple consequence of my overall abdomen having gotten stronger, but I'm not sure.   I want to make sure I do not build muscles on fat. I'd like to get lean (not a bodybuilder kind of lean, but just a regular athletic look) and not like that still-overweight-albeit-very-strong guy at the gym. Any suggestions besides a healthy diet and the workout I already do? Should I change my workout routines? Any suggestions there?   About Me:  I am 21 years old, weigh 165Lbs, 5'5"" tall; 21% body fat; calorie intake set at 2500 according to Samsung Health app, but my average intake is about 1900-2000.  I go to the gym 5 days a week. Mon, Wed, Fri I do cardio (exercise bike) for 45 minutes, and conclude with 30 minutes of weight lifting. I do upper body (bicep curls, etc.), 3 minutes of plank, squats, and calf raises. Tu and Thur I focus only on cardio with 60 minutes on the exercise bike. I conclude it with 3 minutes of plank.  Clarification:  By ""I don't want to build muscle on fat"" I mean I do not wish to maintain my fat while getting stronger and building more muscle. I understand that it is inevitable to have fat and muscle at the same time for a while; I just want to be on a plan where I am sure to reach a point where my fat is gone. It might have come across as that I absolutely don't want any fat present while making muscle. I just wanted to clarify that is not what I meant. I just want the fat gone some reasonable time later down the road.  "
1794,Does duration or intensity or both affect how many calories are burned in a cardio workout.,"Is there a relationship between heart-rate over time and calories burned, or is it just duration?  What about a non-cardio workout? "
1795,Which rep range contributes to the most hypertrophy of calves?,"I've watched videos of two big bodybuilders, Jay Cutler and Hunter Labrada. Both bodybuilders start with the premise of ""your calves are being used all day long..."". Jay Cutler finishes with      You got to train them like every other body part. If I'm doing high repititions when I walk, why would I do high   reptitions in the gym? (Demonstrates with 10 reps)   Hunter Labrada finishes with      It takes more stimulation and reps to train than any other muscle. (Demonstrates with 30 reps)   Which bodybuilder should I believe? Jay Cutler is a far more successful bodybuilder than Hunter Labrada because Jay has been Mr. Olympia 4 times, but both guys look much better than I'd ever hope to be.  "
1796,Sleepiness after weightlifting but only after taking a week-long break,"I've been lifting weights since January 2010. I typically follow one routine for six weeks and then take a week (sometimes two) off before starting a modified routine.    What I've noticed is that when I resume lifting after an idle week, I become incredibly sleepy four or five hours after my weightlifting session.  This lasts for about a week and then I no longer have to deal with this sleepiness until I resume lifting after taking another week.   Does anyone have a good idea of what's going on here? I think I actually gain more muscle during my first week exercising after a break but I really am not sure.    Should I try switching to 3 weeks of lifting with one week breaks or am I over thinking this? "
1797,Am I eating too much or too little?,"Question: I am a 24-year old male. 147 lb. 5’ 11”. 12-14% body fat. I eat about 3315 calories per day. Am I overeating or undereating?  Context: I used to be very skinny at around 121 lb. I started working out and eating more and my weight began to rise very steeply. I also noticed that my appetite was increasing a bit faster than I expected. For the first 2 months of serious lifting, it seemed like my appetite was increasing every week as I got stronger. The meal that satisfied me the previous week was now inadequate for this week. So, I apparently worked my way up to eating a lot of food. I put on about 30 pounds in the first 2 months. My family witnessed this dramatic increase in appetite and criticized me for eating too much. Then, I took a break from lifting because I resumed school but my appetite stayed the same. I got busy and didn’t like cooking so much food for thrice daily eating, so I started eating twice a day (breakfast and dinner). I was initially hungry but my body got used to it. A few weeks later, I dialed back to one meal a day (dinner), and again, my body got used to it. So, that brings us to the present. I have resumed lifting with once daily eating and I am getting stronger and, thankfully, my appetite isn’t increasing. My family still thinks I’m eating too much.   Specifics: I think my lifting age is about 4 months, although I’ve fooled around with weights for more than a year. I work out 3-4x/week in a bro split: Chest &amp; Triceps / Back &amp; Biceps / Legs &amp; Shoulders.  Here are some of my recent numbers to gauge my strength:   Seated Dumbbell Shoulder Press 45 lb 5x7  Pullups (unassisted) 4x7 Deadlift 155 lb 4x7  Flat Dumbbell Bench Press 60 lb 4x7  Dips (unassisted) 5x11   I run 3-4x/week, 2.75 miles/session. I try to increase my speed with each session. Currently @ 7.5 minutes/mile.  My meal info:   Breakfast: 1 cup of soymilk  Lunch: None  Dinner: 1 cup of soymilk, 3.8 servings of broccoli, 4.1 servings of whole grain pasta, 2.9 servings of black eyed peas, 7.8 servings of oatmeal, 3.2 servings of peanuts   Total: 3315 calories 537 g carbs, 155 g protein, 84 g fat, 107 g fiber. 61% carbs 18% protein, 21% fat Besides weightlifting and cardio, I’m very sedentary and work at a desk all day. So, I am eating too much or too little?  EDIT: My estimate is that I am gaining about a pound every 2 weeks. I haven't been tracking my weight as religiously as I used to so I can't say for sure.  "
1798,Can an active person eat more cholesterol?,"Looking at the nutritional facts on an egg carton, I see that one medium sized egg satisfies 71% of the daily nutritional requirements for cholesterol. Many bodybuilders eat up to a dozen of eggs per day, putting them well over the suggested amount of cholesterol. For example, Jay Cutler eats 2 whole eggs and 10 egg whites for breakfast. This puts him at 142% the suggested cholesterol, if we're being conservative and assuming most of the cholesterol is in the yolk. His 4 other meals throughout the day will put him even more over the limit. If you're an active person like Jay Cutler, can you safely consume more than the suggested daily requirements for cholesterol without damaging the heart? Does exercising flush out cholesterol at many magnitudes faster than being sedentary?  "
1799,"If I am on a low-carb diet, is it necessary to take vitamin supplements?","I have been reading this guide to low-carb dieting: [website]and it recommends that I should take regular vitamin supplements.   Is there something that exists in carb-heavy foods that does not exist in meat, veg, etc, that I need to be taking? I am naturally suspicious of anything that recommends I need to take supplements for something that is generally found in food.  What are the risks if I don't use supplements? "
1800,"Why do machine weights increase in steps of 7kg, while dumbbells in steps of 2.5kg?","I have noticed in my nearby gym that they have machine equipment like: lat press/lat pull down/machine fly/etc. all of which have their successive weights as: 5kg, 12kg, 19kg, and so on.  On the other hand, the dumbbells are in steps of 2.5kg i.e. 2.5kg, 5kg, 7.5kg, etc.  Considering that the same human body exercises on both types of the equipment, why does one set of equipment increase in 7kg and the other in 2.5kg? What factors would make one number a better fit for one type of exercise, and the other for the other type?   I personally find the number 7 an odd step to choose as it is a prime number and has a non-terminating decimal expansion (1/7=0.(142857)) "
1801,Should I wear running shoes to go running if I'm training for sports,"I've started running lately. This is mainly to build up my stamina when I play sports like soccer, tennis etc.  So far, I'm running my cross trainers. When I get to about 5km or more, my feet start to hurt. It's probably because I'm unfit and not used to running and I'll probably get over it.  A friend recommended I get proper running shoes but.  I think running shoes will definitely be better for running but is it a good idea if you are running so you can get better at something else? Wouldn't my feet get conditioned to all the comfort and cushioning of the running shoes, and then when I play sports, my feet won't be used to running without them? Should I just bear the pain to try to condition my feet to run in run in actual real world environments? "
1802,Why is it beneficial for powerlifters and heavy weight olympic lifters to not have low body fat?,"Most powerlifters and heavy weight olympic lifters have a lot of muscle, but are not skinny, why not? Would excess fat not hinder them in their technical lifts? "
1803,How to lie down on your back properly during Yoga?,"If you know about Yoga, then you know we have to lie on our back during Uttanpadasana (Raised Foot Pose). I do this comfortably. But I'm doubtful if I'm lying down properly or not. How I lie is in following way:   Now if you 1st position in image, the knees are relaxed but spine is curved upwards (Note that the curve doesn't represent belly, it's about spine) and there is space between ground and spine (maybe 1-2 inches).  In 2nd position, I have to apply a little effort to 'relax' the abdomen and the spine becomes straight (probably) and space is negligible (I'ts like when we walk without our spine straight, like slouching). But at the same time, the knees are raised a bit, so to bring them down and make legs straight I've to force, so this position doesn't make me feel relaxed.  While in 1st position, I feel relaxed.  So I just want to know if 1st position is right or wrong?  Also, during Yoga (Raised Foot pose) I feel pressure at lower spine, and also in the belly, like stretching). Is this what this Yoga is intended to do?  (I raise feet around 30-40 degrees). "
1804,"""Warming up"" - What is actuall happening in muscles and tendons?","I hear of many piano players that do ""warm up"" excercises (and by that, they mean that they play on the piano a bit, for example Hanon, or things like that). I myself have also made the experience that after some minutes of playing, my playing gets smother, and the likelyhood I ""miss"" a key (miss in the sense that the force applied to the key actually is too small, which results in the key remaining silent) shrinks. I especially observe the same effect (stronger keystrokes, basically) when I exaggerated the movements before, and pressed the keys way stronger than they usually should be pressed.   An explanation I have read once (don't know anymore where I have read that) is that those kind of ""warm-up-exercises"" result in a (temporarely) higher tonus of the muscles, which results in a temporarely perceived higher ability to press keys. Is this explanation valid?    Are the observations that I have made all linked to ""warming up"" helping my playing? What exactly does warming up do to my muscles and my tendons, that leads to a higher ability of playing smooth runs on the piano?  Edit: To be honest I'm rather unhappy with the question having been migrated to this page, because a) it is common to do ""warming up'"" on the piano (In the way I described), b) it doesn't have that mutch to do with the warm ups in sports (stretching and such), and c) I would have hoped for opinions of pianoplayers and there experiences with ""warming up"". I haven't been asked wether I want this question to be migrated either.  "
1805,Weight is higher in the Evening than the Morning?,"I am trying to lose weight, more accurately I am trying to lose weight around my stomach area (overall I am a healthy weight), and I have taken to weighing myself in the morning and evening. Mostly to give my self some artificial goals.   Anyway I noticed that I weight less in the morning than I do in the evening! It's usually around 0.2/3 of a stone difference. Is this common?

1807,Wrist pain with UHG deadlifts and fat grip pullups,"About six months ago, I hurt my wrist whilst doing deadlifts with an underhanded grip (i.e. the position at the top of the deadlift looks like the bottom of a bicep curl). The pain was at the base of my wrist on the little finger side just above the round bony bit that sticks out.  I stopped doing the offending exercise and all was good.  Then today, whilst doing pullups on a tree branch (overhand grip) I experienced exactly the same injury. The tree branch was about the same circumference as a loaf of bread, and it is angled, so obviously it was very different to pull-ups using a pull up bar.   As soon as I felt the pain, I stopped and turned around (i.e. so the branch would be sloping in the opposite direction relative to my body), with the same result.  I've done plenty of pull-ups on that same tree before with no injury, so not sure why I hurt myself today.  Unloaded, my wrist feels 98%, no real pain and no loss of motion.   Any suggestions as to what might have happened? And what should I do? How long should I rest my wrist? "
1808,Transitioning from calisthenics to weighted calisthenics,"I recently switched over from lifting to calisthenics and I am really loving it. I do, however, acknowledge that I will lose some size due to not using weights. For that reason I would like to start weighting certain exercises. My routine is as follows, with the exercises I hope to weight highlighted in bold:  Monday   Wide pullup 3x8 Close pullup 3x8 Normal pullup 3x8 Diamond pushups 3x15 Triceps extension 4x8 Straight bar dips 3x8 Dips 3x10   Tuesday   Pistol squats 5x5 Normal squats 4x20 Close squats 4x20 Lunges matrix 3x8 Calf raises 5x20   Wednesday   Rest   Thursday   Military press 3x8 (I am at risk of a detached retina so I do not want to do handstand pushups) Hindu pushups 4x10 Pseudo pushups 4x10 Straight bar dips 4x10 Dips 4x10   Friday   Rest   Saturday   Wide pushups 3x15 Close pushups 3x15 Decline pushups 3x15 Dips 4x15 Chinups 4x8 Chinups negatives 3x8   I have a few questions:   If I were to continue this routine without weights, is it effective, balanced, and sustainable for several years? Will adding weights make a substantial difference in results? Do I have the right proportion of weighted to non-weighted exercises?  "

1810,Can I use hip adductor machine to stretch legs for splits?,"I'm using a hip adductor machine to stretch my legs for splits. I set the angle selector to 3rd position from maximum, set weight to 65kg, and allow it to apply pressure to stretch my legs for 2 minutes while slightly vibrating my legs by flexing leg muscles. Then I rest and switch to 95kg load and repeat. Then I set angle selector to 2nd from max (since my legs can already stretch beyond the angle of 3rd position) etc... I also apply additional gentler pressure with my arms to further stretch my legs. I don't risk going beyond 105 kilograms of machine weight to keep control.   I've had a lot of martial arts training when I was 13-22 (10 years ago), that included stretching, though I never reached full splits. My body is in good shape in terms of muscle tone and cardio. I've been doing this kind of stretching for a month and it looks to be working, while not causing any issues.  Does this stretching make sense? Are there any known dangers for this particular stretching?  "

1812,How to Strengthen Legs at Home,"Between job, taking care of family, and studying for certifications, it's a miracle I even have time to exercise.  I can easily purchase heavier dumbbells to work my upper body, but how to add resistance to lower body?  The only option I see is to buy ankle weights (I already have 5 lbs), but somehow I am thinking if I purchase heavier and heavier ones, the Velcro isn't strong enough to keep the ankle weights closed firm around the ankles.  Unfortunately, going to gym is not option at this time, else I'd do leg presses and all.  Any ideas?  Thanks! "
1813,Diet/exercise plan for lean bulking,"I'm currently skinny fat, currently lean-bulking. My age is 16, and I weigh 62kg with 180cm (136.4 lbs, 5'9"")  Normally, my diet is as follows:   On days I workout or if I'm active during the day, I eat up to 2000kcal When I'm inactive during the day, I eat around 1650kcal   The proportions are as follows (regardless of the day)   50% Carbs 23% fat  27% protein Try for a max of 45g sugars and at least 20g fiber   I go to the gym 3x/week and do HIIT 2x/week.  Questions:  Will this diet work over the long term until I'm big enough to cut, and are there other nutrients that I need to track? What about cheat meals, and is this a good diet plan and workout program?  EDIT 1 :  Ok, Thanks for the responce.  But, from what I've seen in this video ( [website]Now, sorry for not specifying my program.  When I go to the gym (2x/week) I do mostly chest (bench, incline bench, push-ups, etc.) + other compound movements (deadlifts) Out of the 2 days/week that I do this, I at least 1x do a 10min HIIT on the treadmill after I do this (1min intense, 1min slower). As for the chest workout I do mostly 3 sets of 7-11 reps (to failure, rest is 35s-minute). As for the deadlifts it differs but around 5x5.  Next, at home (1x/week) I do biceps, triceps (dumbells) and body-weight training. And finally, HIIT (1x or 2x/week) I like to do a dumbell HIIT training, based on this video : [website]I always used to eat less than others. So it seems a lot to eat 2300kcal for me as a 16yo. So,as for the diet, I changed it recently. my TDEE was around 2000-2400 calories. But for me (as I said, for a 16 y.o. with a lot body fat it seems like a lot) But still, I now eat around 2250kcal when inactive, and around 200-400kcal more when I'm active. I track my food and as for my macros, it differs every day, but it's now around 46% carbs, 26% protein and 28% fat (of course it differs, but it stays around these numbers)  Daily, I try do not overcome 45g of sugar, and try to eat at least 22g of fiber. I eat quite a lot of Whole-grain foods (bread, toast-bread etc.) and I don't know if that's OK (it fits the diet and macros)  From what I read, I think my testosterone levels are quite low. I don't want to go to some test to see how much, but I'd like to increase the levels, so daily, I try to eat natural almonds (around 15g daily), eggs (not everyday), want to buy some kind of natural peanut butter, and other things, which could increase testosterone levels  From the time I was young, I always hated vegetables and fruits. Now I'm trying to eat as much as I can, but I just can't stand most of them. I can eat vegetables in soups, or cooked vegetables, but I'm just unable to eat some most uncooked vegetables. I'm able to eat 'raw' (uncooked) carrot, brocolli, garlic, radish, and thats about it. As I said, I eat i guess all vegetables if cooked (I dont know why that is) And fruit, I eat apple, oranges, strawberrys rarely, bananas, and again, thats about it.  Thanks in advance for the help :). "
1814,"No longer an absolute beginner, unsure of diet","I follow reddit's bodyweight fitness and have been doing it on and off for a few years. However, it was only this year that I have been seriously doing it with only a couple months of break this summer due to injury.  Now I am noticeably stronger than before. I have moved most of my exercises to rings and I've gained considerable weight. Just as a reference of my current level, I now do 3 sets of ring pushups at low reps(5-8). I'm 6' and 175lb and from appearance I may be around 24% bmi  I still feel pretty good progression on my workout and feel confident that I can gain more mass as long as I eat well. However, I am getting slightly put off by the extra fat. Is this time for me to cut? Am I still considered a beginner in the sense that I can lose fat and gain muscle at a TDEE deficit?  As for diet I'm not calorie counting but I have been taking effort to maximize my protein intake. I also have a good feel of how much food I am eating and can generally control my calorie intake +/-500 relatively ok.  My goal isn't to be extremely buff but be fit and lean but not skinny. I think 15% bmi is my ultimate goal, just have some ab definition. "
1815,Efficient protein choices for hiking,"I did a hiking vacation once and intend to do it again this summer. It isn't too sternous, and it involves sleeping at tourist lodges* and only wearing clothes in the backpack (no food or sleeping bags). I have never done any serious work outs, and have a sedentary lifestyle and weak muscles. So this is quite a big increase in physical activity for me.   A downside I noticed last vacation is that the food available at the lodges is very different from my usual diet. I eat moderately low carb, with maybe 90-100 g protein intake a day, and my carbs come mainly from vegetables. There are often days when I don't touch any starchy staples. The lodges, on the other hand, offer cheapest staples energy-boosted with vegetable oil. It is not unusual to have a stew consisting of rice and potatoes only, as a complete meal. If there is any meat, it is low-quality ground meat stretched with fillers before turning it into meatballs. The result is that in my most active period of the year I am getting 10-15 g of protein instead of my usual 90-100. It was noticeable last time I did it: I felt lethargic. Not tired from activity (it was an easy trek), but really languid. So this time, I want to bring protein with me.   I've heard that professional sportlers have protein supplements, and thought that I can use these. Somebody said that I could take protein bars with me, but these turned out to have a fairly low concentration of protein, around 30%. Not only am I better off choosing a high quality salami, it means that I'll have to take almost 300 g per day, so 2 kg for the whole seven days. This is a very big addition to my 4.5 kg backpack, and I am looking for something more compact. And in Amazon reviews, some people complain of a very soft, marzipan like consistency - this is certain to get squished in the backpack.   There are shakes too, but this doesn't sound very convenient for hiking. They need a shaker, which means more volume and weight in the backpack. There is always the risk of spillage of powder in the backpack. And then reviewers often hate the artificial taste, noting that it is sometimes impossible to get it down, especially when made with water instead of milk. I won't have milk available, and I dislike the taste of processed food in general. So this option has lots of drawbacks too.   Is there a good protein source I have overseen? Or if bars or shake powder is the best option available, are there any tricks how to mitigate the problems with them?   *I couldn't find a good translation for that "
1816,How to increase BMR by 100%?,"I'm researching about how to increase BMR efficiently. (Note that BMR, not TDEE)   I want to increase mine by 100% in the long term. How can I do that?  A way is increasing muscle obvisously. Also we see people whose metabolism is faster than usual. They don't move much but they are always skinny even if they eat a lot! I'm sure there are tons of variables relevant but maybe there is something we could replicate or develop to be similar to them. Any ideas about this? "

1818,What can I do for cardio while I am on vacation with no equipment?,"I started exercising and eating healthier 3 months ago and am really motivated and on a great schedule. I swim for 30 minutes 2-3 times a week, hike with elevation gain 2.2 miles 1-2 times a week (carrying my 24 pound dog for half of the hike), and do resistance/weight training with a personal trainer 2 times a week. My routine varies a little bit from week to week but i always work out for an hour 6 days a week. I have lost 21 pounds so far but have 50-60 more to go. I really want to stay on track with my exercise program both to keep losing weight and to maintain the fitness level I have worked so hard to achieve.  I am leaving for a trip to Glacier National Park next week with my husband and a friend, neither of whom work out regularly. The trip will be for 9 days. 2 days of travel. We plan to do 5 days of long hikes, but I am unsure of just how much hiking we will be able to do - this will depend on the others on the trip. I am not willing to do any hiking alone since there are grizzly bears in the park and I don't want to encounter one on my own. Also the weather is very unpredictable at this time of year - they are having thunderstorms right now, but it is supposed to clear up in a few days. I plan to bring a pack and some Nalgene water bottles that I can fill with water so that I can hike with some extra weight and get a better workout. Also my trainer is sending me with resistance bands and a detailed resistance training program. But my question is how do I make sure that I can get some serious cardio workouts even if it rains most of the time? I am very good with my diet, so the only thing I need to figure out is what to do on our non- hiking days (we will have two days off from hiking and I will already be taking the two travel days off from exercising). I have thought about running but had some trouble with my knees which I am working my way back from. Inflammation under the kneecap which I went to physical therapy for. And I think that I'd like to lose some more weight and do my knee exercises a little longer before I try running. Oh yeah, its probably already obvious, but i wont have access to a gym or any equipment. But i will bring my heart rate monitor. We will be staying in a cabin.   Any suggestions? I would really appreciate any advice. Thanks! "

I will likely start with some variation of the Beast Mode plan:     My question is, how much muscle mass will I lose from this transition?

I want to lose about 10lbs max, I've been working out for about a year so the weight isn't all fat, I also have some muscle. I work out 3-4 times a week. I've entered this information into multiple iifym calculators and the results were all pretty similar, so I'm gonna post the one from the official iifym website.   Total calories: 1716  Protein: 131g  Fat: 69g  Carbs: 144g  BMR: 1567  TDEE: 2145  These macros seem way too high? If I'm not mistaken, the more you work out, the more you should eat.   Just to give you and example, 3 days ago I burnt 618kcal which would bring my macros to somewhere around 2300, and I only ate 1850. Yesteday, I burnt 371kcal which brought my macros up to somewhere around 2000, but I ate 1714.   I also used the lifesum app which put my macros to 1655kcal a day. Is that the correct amount?   I guess I'm looking for advice on how much I should eat, on days when I work out and on days when I don't, because I'm assuming those calories should vary, but if they shouldn't, please correct me. I'm worried if I eat too much I'll gain weight but I'm not sure if eating too little would be good too.  "

I have just come out of a period where I found it difficult to find time for exercise. Previous to this most of my exercise came through my main hobby - whitewater kayaking. While I have never had particularly good cardio fitness, I have never had as high a body fat percentage as I do now. Also I had no belly!  So I have a few questions: my body fat percentage of 19% is just below unacceptable for my age (25), and I would prefer to consider myself healthy, rather than just about avoiding heart disease.   Things are far from critical for me, and I would prefer and gain fitness doing things I enjoy - namely mountain biking, cycling and kayaking.   I also don't particularly want to change my diet, which is high carb, reasonable amount of protein and not a lot of fruit veg (apart from a banana in the morning with breakfast) So I have two questions:  1: Is it possible to become relatively fit without going for runs? If this isn't the case, then is it possible to run without knackering all of my joints? How would swimming be as a substitute? (if needs be)  2: I plan to track my progress on a weekly basis using RunKeeper. I would be interested to know what kind of gains someone who was taking the traditional approach to fitness would expect? I'd like to see if my progress is anything close to comparable.  At what point should I decide that what I am doing is not working? "

1825,Are we more likely to develop rhabdomyolysis if we suffered from one before?,I was diagnosed with rhabdomyolysis once. (CK levels were around 10k)  Now I am wondering: am I more likely to get another one? Or does one's history has nothing to do with it? I wasn't able to find any information on this. 
1826,List of muscles by volume in average man,"Is there any research-based list of muscles and muscle groups by their volume or mass, in average men (or even any subset of healthy human population)?  It's easy to find statements like gluteus maximus and quadriceps femoris being among the biggest muscles in the body, but without precise data. With some effort I can also find research such as [website]  It's typically around 10 mm thick (compared to 20 mm thick superficial fat),[2] or 20 mm thick in young athletes such as handball players.[3] Typical volume is around 300 cm³ in non-active indivuals, or almost 500 cm³ in athletes (tennis players).[4]   I can't however find an overview. Any suggestion? Another question asks about relative size with a focus on upper vs. lower body. "
1827,Stronglifts 5x5 related question,"What are the accessories that you add with stronglifts and why?   As given on the website, I added chins and dips; reverse crunches(or hanging leg raises) and crunches; barbell curls and skullcrushers; and 10 minutes of HIIT cardio.   This is how my routine looks like now:   A. Squat(5x5), Bench(5x5), T-bar row(5x5), Weighted dips(3 sets), Skullcrusher(3 sets), Abs, Cardio   B. Squat(5x5), Overhead Press(5x5), Deadlift(1x5), Weighted Chins(3 sets), Curls(3 sets), Abs, Cardio   As I mentioned earlier, for abs, I perform one of either crunches, or leg raise, or reverse crunches.   Cardio: 5 rounds of 45 seconds treadmill and 15 seconds off. 5 rounds of 45 seconds step up step down(unsure of the proper name, it is like I would step my right leg, and then left, and then step down my right leg, followed by left leg, in a fast motion) and 15 seconds off.   Am I missing any body parts? If yes, what would be your suggestions, since I want to work towards being stronger, as well as looking good and symmetrical? (I have changed my routine from this one) "
1828,Effective ways to lose weight and gain muscle,"I am a 21 year old male, overweight with BMI 27.6, body fat 21.5%. My goal is to lose weight and gain muscle. I am no expert in fitness so I'm here hoping to gain professional insight.  My plan:   I go to the gym Mon through Fri.   Mon, Wed, Fri I use the Peloton Spin Bike for 45 minutes, where following their spin classes I burn about 500 Cal. Then I lift weights for 30 minutes.  I then drink a protein shake: Pure Protein Whey protein, milk, one banana and one teaspoon of peanut butter.   Tuesday and Thursday I simply spin bike for 60 minutes (about 600 Cal) and do some ab workouts. No protein drinks.    Does drinking the shake itself work against my efforts to lose weight? Am I going about this the right way? Is it ok health-wise? Generally speaking, what else should I do to effectively lose weight and gain muscle? Would you recommend following a health-fitness mobile app such as MyFitnessPal? Perhaps something more detailed and accurate?  "

1836,"When measuring heart-rate recovery, what should I compare?","I have been recently diagnosed with asthma. I have always had a hard time to get fit so I try to figure out if regular training has impact on my fitness. I have been running intervals for the last couple of months with a pulse band.  As far as I have understood, a decent metric for if your fitness is improving is to track if your heartrate recovers fast. I'm trying to figure out exactly what data I should compare.  When doing intervals, should I compare each interval to the same in another session, comparing the delta on every first sprint by them selves, every second sprint by themselves etc or are they expected to be more or less the same?  Does it matter what pulse I had at the end of the interval or should they be more or less the same? "
1837,Is there a way you can you improve your reflexes and reactions generally?,"I always wondered ,I played volleyball for some years and I saw my reflexes on the field improve amazingly,my brain could process the information faster.But outside of the field my reflexes were not better than other people in normal tasks.For example reacting to a accident,or catching a phone that slipped from the table. My question is:Is there a way to improve your brain reactions/reflexes generally?Any exercises to improve them? I assume you can do certain exercises to improve them because It's a skill and any skill can normally be improved. I'm not sure if I should ask this question on this SE site but I got no idea where to ask it. "
1838,How to do a one-arm pushup?,"I'd like to do a one-arm pushup. I'm aware of the guide on Beastskills, but it fails to get into much specifics on how to actually progress to it (for the record, I'm trying to do what is referred in that guide as the ""arm in"" method - ie. normal pushup form, one arm, not contorting myself somehow to shift my center of mass).   Currently, when I try it, I cannot even lower myself: I manage a few centimeters and then just drop. I guess I can't handle the tension? No method of stiffening my body, visualization or anything else helped me get past that point, so I guess it's a problem of strength (my endurance is fine, I can crank out 50 pushups easily enough). What's a good exercise to work toward a one armed pushup? I don't have any weights available but I do have a pull up bar. "
1839,How can I get a better mobility and flexibility?,"I want to get a better mobility and flexibility. A first goal I have is touching my feet with outstretched legs. Also, I want to be able to lift the outstretched leg into a horizontal position while standing upright. How can I accomplish that? Is it effective to do a stretching workout on one day a week? Or is it better to stretch before a 'normal' workout? I really appreciate any help! "
1840,What is the scientific relation between Low-Carb diets and High levels of Cholesterol?,"ok. I have been in a low-carb diet for the last 3 weeks. My lab report from friday showed a 213 MG/DL Total cholesterol from my last read on 2010 of 189.  Is there any scientific correlation between low-carb diets and increase of cholesterol?  Another question is, if I change my low-carb diet to not include any red meat, will that make any difference?  I checked this question, but it did not help.  Do high protein diets pose any serious risk to health?  "
1841,How to train for carrying heavy stuff?,"In two weeks I'm going to carry old furniture from my parents home to the sidewalk in front of the house.  How do I prepare for this event best? By training strength, endurance, cardio, HIIT, ...?  I think in general this has something to with how to best train for holding a heavy weights in a fixed position. Normally one trains by moving weights up and down but not by statically holding them in the air, so I'm not sure how to approach such a training goal.  EDIT: I should have mentioned that I'm already training three to four times a week in the gym and I'm fairly fit (althoug still overweight), so it's more a question on how to modify my current training and not about starting from scratch. "
1842,How does doing more repetitions improve muscle definition?,"I always heard people saying lifting heavier weights helps build muscle mass while doing more repetitions helps improve muscle definition. I have no trouble understanding the former. But how does one rationalize the latter? In the past, I used to think that doing more repetitions helps burn away fat at the target area, thereby making the muscle looks more define. But after reading answers to this question, it seems the common consensus is that there is no way to target fat loss. So, how does doing more repetitions make the muscle looks more define? Or is this just a myth? "
1843,How can I organize my meals to accomodate an evening workout?,"My workout time is 7pm, when I get out from work and hit the gym. My goal is to loose weight, therefore I don't want to have any meals after 7-8pm. How can I accomodate the meals/snacks surrounding workout in order to keep a healthy nutrition schedule?  What time should I have a pre-workout snack/meal? What should the post-workout snack contain?  I guess that my main meal of the day would be sometime during the afternoon.  I am open to any suggestions you have, both for scheduling when to eat and when to eat it. "
1844,Swimming for muscle building and fat burn,"I heard that swimming is the best option for a whole body workout, but I don't really know what effects that swimming has on my body.   Does swimming burn fat and help me building muscles (my first priority is: abs and back muscles)?   Is swimming short and intensive or slow and over a long time better for building muscle and burning fat? "
1845,Why is it so beneficial to a human being to sleep 7 or 8 hours to have good muscle growth?,Why is it so beneficial to a human being to sleep 7 or 8 hours to have good muscle growth? I recently started with bodybuilding and I gained a good amount of muscle in just a few weeks.  But I started to think why is it so beneficial to a human being who specially focuses on muscle growth to sleep the recommended daily dose of 7 till 8 hours?  L.S.:  I've already looked here but it hasn't got an answer. So an answer would be appreciated.  
1846,Running wearing a jumper vs. running without,"Does running with a jumper (i.e. causing yourself to sweat more during a workout) increase the effect of a workout?  If the answer is no, then what does running in a jumper do? I've read it doesn't help you to loose weight (because you're loosing water rather than fat), and you've got to be careful you don't dehydrate yourself... so does it do anything positive, or should I stick to shorts and t-shirt?  I used to run in shorts and t-shirt, but I've switched to joggers and sweatshirt because it feels harder, and I assumed it was doing more good for me (because I can feel my body working harder running the same distance).  (I guess ""effect of a workout"" is ambiguous, so to add some context for my case: My intended effects of running are to keep building my stamina, improving my fitness and keep my body toned.) "
1847,How early should I eat before Hockey training,"I have just started playing hockey, and it is in the evening. So it is after work (about 02:30 hours). I usually get cramps when doing training, so:   How long before training should you eat? What is the best food to have before training?   A friend of mine said I should have plain cooked pasta, about an hour before training. "
1848,Bodyweight Workouts Sets & Reps and Intensity & Volume - Difference in completing in Single session instead of spread over Multiple?,"Lets say, I want to do 100 pushups daily in one go, or improve my overall ability to do Pull ups.   I am not strong enough now to do that now.   If I do 100 pushups, spreading over the whole day, will I get less benefits that doing 100 pushups in one go?   What would be a better way to give Load &amp; Recovery to my body for best results? "
1849,"What's the best exercise to get more well defined abs, a.k.a Muscle hypertrophy","I've searched the internet for core exercises for building abs, and I'm a little bit confused. Some say that sit-ups is great for getting well defined abs, while some say you only get better at doing sit-ups, and nothing else. I understand that doing sit-ups is better than nothing, and that it's building up the abs in some way. My question is what is the best exercise for getting as big/well defined abs as possible? And how many reps and sets? "
1850,Can I train to improve my Lactate Threshold?,"From Wikipedia:     Lactate inflection point (a.k.a. Lactate Threshold), is the exercise intensity at which the blood concentration of lactate and/or lactic acid begins to exponentially increase. Often expressed as 85% of maximum heart rate or 75% of maximum oxygen intake. When exercising at or below the LT, any lactate produced by the muscles is removed by the body without it building up.   With a view to improving cycling/running times when working at that lactate threshold point, could specific training help improve my lactate threshold over time? If so, what type of training would be best suited? "
1851,wrist/forearm pain when doing pullups,"just started doing pull ups again after a while as i got a straight pull up bar for home use... so when i went on it i was doing it for about 10 mins then stopped doing about ten reps each time but about an hour later it started hurting when i tried to do more pull ups or other such activities. what can i do to help it recover and what may have occurred? could it be a sprain in both wrists?  i am 17, male  thanks in advance "

1853,Deadlift and Rack Lifts,"My max deadlift (for now) is 435lbs, my above knee max rack lift is 605lbs, my just below knee max rack lift is 450lbs....does this indicate that my 'take off' is the weak part of the lift? and if so, what can I do to improve the bottom part of my dead lift? "
1854,What is the best way to arrange your sets at the gym?,"So let's say today I'm doing back, and biceps. For simplicity, let's assume I want to do 3 different exercises to target by back (Back 1, Back 2, and Back 3), and 3 different exercises to target my biceps (Biceps 1, Biceps 2, and Biceps 3). Let's assume I want to do 4 sets of each exercise.  How should I arrange them?  Right now, I'm alternating the exercises to give my muscles a rest. For example:   Back 1 Biceps 1 Back 2 Biceps 2 Back 3 Biceps 3 (Repeat until I complete 4 sets for each exercise)   However, I'm noticing some people at the gym who instead just do all four sets of one exercise at once and then move to the next. For example:   Back 1 Back 1 Back 1 Back 1 Biceps 1 Biceps 1 Biceps 1 Biceps 1 And so on.   Some don't even alternate the exercises. They just go:   Back 1 Back 1 Back 1 Back 1 Back 2 Back 2 ... Biceps 1 Biceps 1 Biceps 1 Biceps 1 Biceps 2 And so on.   So, which is the right way to organize your sets of exercises? "
1855,"What is a recovery meal, and of what should it consist?","People sometimes talk about a ""recovery meal"".   What is a recovery meal? When should one eat the recovery meal? Of what should it consist?   There may be variation depending on the preceding activity, but there are probably some guiding principles. "
1856,How many sets per muscle?,"My current program consists of a 5 day workout. Each muscle group (say chest for example) has 3 different exercises divided in 4 sets of 12 repetitions. Tempo is 2 seconds down and 1 up.  Monday/Thursday  Chest   Bench press Incline dumbbell press Dip on bar   Biceps    Preacher curl with dumbbell Concentrated curls Barbell curl   Tuesday/Friday   Back   Chin ups Close grip pull (seated) Bent over row with dumbbell   Triceps    Push down Incline triceps extension Forward triceps extension    Wednesday   Legs   Squats Lying leg curl Good morning Standing leg calf raise   Shoulder   Lateral raise Frontal raise Shrugs   Every second day I do abs/forearms or reconditioning of shoulders (very light weight).  The Problem  The amount of weight that I could lift went down considerably (of course) but I am noticing more bulking in some muscles than others: My legs become inflated very fast and biceps as well, but I do not see the same result in chest and back. And I think it has to do with the amounts of sets per muscle, even though all muscles have 4 sets and 12 reps.   There are so many variables that I don't even know how to Can it be the tempo? Perhaps exercises?  Can someone guide me on how to improve? ----------------------------------------------------------------  Some more info:  - My goal is gaining muscle and toning (aesthetics)  - Changing program every second month  - 60g of protein on workout days  - 30 year old male, 174cm, 75Kg "
1857,I keep having to lower my weights by a couple Pounds on each set. What am I doing wrong?,"When my work out begins, I normally begin strong. For example, I can lift up to 30 Lbs doing bicep curls, I can feel the burn, but it's not difficult at all to do the curls in good form; but as the workout progresses, I find myself having to lower my weights in each set. For example, by the second set of bicep curls, I have to lower the weights to 27 Lbs to maintain good form. By the third set I'm doing 25 Lbs, and so on.  It's not that I start feeling tired, low energy or anything, it's just that my muscles simply can't take it. What am I doing wrong? I was hoping I could maintain the same number of pounds throughout the entire workout. What do I need to change? Should I start with lower weights even though they'll feel too light? "
1858,How should a proper stretching workout look like? How to warm up for it?,"How should a proper stretching session look like? How should I warm up or cool down for a stretching training? And how long should they be and what exercises should they exactly consist of?   Should I keep the balance between the exercised muscles or there is no risk in breaking it? I mean, if I do forward bends am I obliged to do backward ones too?  Finally, I would like to stretch a little bit as a break during my work, can I do so? How far then could such a mini session be stripped down from a full one?    Please note :  I do not ask about the stretching part of a warm-up before some non-stretching training like bodybuilding for example.    Update concerning my objectives:  I wanted to start stretching for many quite unrelated reasons. First of all I started to have some problems with joints making cracking sounds (in shoulder and legs) and I have read that stretching that exhausts various ranges of motion could help. Secondly it came to me it would be cool to be able to do a split (which in turn would increase my range of motion in kicking, however this in not the main goal), some hardcore forward bends (like those of yoga, see: 1 or 2 ) and the sitting positions of yoga ( like the lotus pose ).  "
1859,What strategies should a fit middle-aged novice runner use to get started?,"My wife and I are both generally fit, neither of us run and both of us are interested in introducing it to our fitness plan.    I study (and teach) Taekwondo while she does extensive aerobic exercise every morning.  We both have good cardiovascular systems and good endurance.  It would be great to introduce recreational distance running to the exercise plan since we live in an area that offers a lot of gorgeous options for it.  However, we're both middle-aged now so we're trying to be sensible about getting started.   What are some risks for us to watch out for?  Skeletal stress?  Muscles? Should we be looking for different gear? Does the target stride change as you get older?  The pace?   For what it's worth, I've seen this older question:  What are the basics to slowly becoming a runner?  While ""Use Couch 2 5K"" is a suggestion, it doesn't really address age-related issues beyond ""this is a pretty good app."" "
1860,Should I run a marathon without training for it if I'm training for half-marathon?,"In a few weeks I'm going to run my first half-marathon. I ran a lot of 10K races, but never a marathon.   Should I run a marathon a couple of months later my half-marathon, without a specific training? Or it could be better to wait more time? "
1861,How do you use a heart rate monitor for track workouts and speed work?,McMillan running calculator states that your heart rate for speed work should be +90%maxHR. My heart rate takes about 45 seconds to rise from resting during track workouts.    Should it peak at +90%maxHR by the end of a 200 meter repeat that is 35-45 seconds? Should it peak or average at +90%maxHR for longer distances? Should it peak or average during the first repeats of a workout or later on?   Heart rate monitors are easy to use for a 20 minute tempo run but what about these shorter times?  Im asking about the dynamic change in heart rate at the start of a repeat like below. The 100m sprints arent even long enough I think to use heart rate...right? Here the maxHR is 184 bpm so 90% starts at 165.6 and Im just getting to that at the end of each 400m. Initially I thought 90% was closer to 170 bpm. Basically Im trying to hit 92-95% maxHR and Im wondering if Im chasing a ghost?   
1862,How does Voodoo Floss work?,"Voodoo Floss is a new(?) trend in CrossFit that basically involves, if I understand it correctly, wrapping a muscle group or joint very tightly in a thing called a voodoo band while stretching or performing certain exercises to improve mobility and strength in the wrapped area.   How does this work? What is happening physiologically under a voodoo floss band? "
1863,Is muscle strength 100% correlated with testosterone levels?,"I have heard time and time again that T levels are indicative of strength since muscle size is often associated with absolute strength in all respects. Since we know that strength and size are not 1:1, but are relative to each other, does testosterone influence really indicative strength implementations alone?  What I am saying is, if one can be stronger(but smaller in muscle size), is it correct to assume one can be stronger but have LESS testostetone than another?  I know it is responsible for muscle size, but we already covered that muscle size is not always the best, fullest measure of total strength. Strength is also neuro-connected, which doesn't rely 100% on test levels alone.  I ask this because I cry watching things that emotionally touch me, and I know other males, like me, who do not. I am also flabby, out of shape,  and have more relative body fat than muscle mass. However,  I have easily overpowered men with larger muscles than me and even in better shape, more ""macho"", refined in workouts, toned, etc.  I assume that I would have to have less test than these bigger guys with chiseled jaws, toned arms, low BF, less emotional. But why am I stronger?   To sum it up, is testosterone alone 100% correlated with strength? If so, why am I stronger with less? "

1866,Techniques to reduce elbow pain during back day,"Heads up: I have a muscle imbalance between my left and right back, my right back is more developed.  Yesterday I went to the gym for my usual back day. I started with perhaps 3 sets of neutral close grip pullups, at 7-5-4 respectively. Then, I did perhaps 3 sets of bent over dumbell rows at 8 reps. Usually I do these with 15kg dumbells, but I managed to do 20kg yesterday with good form.  Now, I then jumped on to try to do more pull-ups (same grip_ and immediately felt a little pain in the region between my inner elbow and tricep. I have read that this is called the medial epicondyle.          My question is: What is the reason for this pain?       From watching this video here it could be that my forearms are taking too much of a load. He suggests to use neutral grip pullups, but this is what I am already doing! What can I do about my technique in future to reduce this problem?  Any recommended stretches?  At the moment, that region of my arm is a little sensitive to touch. I'll be seeing my physio tomorrow. "
1867,Circuit training plan and diet,"I am currently enrolled in a circuit training gym and just 'leveled up' to level 3 last month (after about half a year of being in level 1-2 sporadically). I have been more consistent now (2-3 times a week) but now I also attend some yoga and body balance classes to accompany my wife.  The current workout consists of 2 days of circuit training. 1 complete circuit is 10 minutes of 20 stations of quick workouts for 30 seconds each. every even numbered station is made of ""active rest"": jumping jacks, side steps, jumping rope, box hops, skaters, etc. Odd numbered stations focus on different parts of the body: rows, shrugs, kettlebell swings, clean and jerks, and squats.  My basic goal is to lose my tummy and gradually tone my muscles and abs. So far, my muscles are turning out fine, but the tummy isn't going away. I know this is the last part to actually go away but I just want to make sure I'm doing everything right.  So my new plan now is to yoga/body balance class on T/TH/S and then circuit train on W/F or M/W. Question is, how do I maximize the benefits of these workouts through my food intake?   The food context for this workout is: weekday breakfast consists of what I can get a hold on(noodles - not healthy but still looking for other alternatives. oats? sandwiches?) lunch is usually rice with some tuna or chicken. dinner is a chicken sandwich before working out(but then based on the comments it looks like i should postpone it to after working out...its kinda hard to workout hungry though)  Is this diet okay so far?( besides the bad breakfasts). I also usually go hungry throughout the day and would like some suggestions as to how to alleviate this without compromising the workouts. I hope this provides enough information :) "
1868,Are there health risks associated with protein shakes?,"Browsing the web I found the following image:    Seems that lots of them have heavy metals in them.

(following the recommended intake of the producer, of course) Has anyone experienced or has any study that suggest direct relation to diseases over the use of supplements?   It is kinda hard to find (and separate) the good literature from the fear mongering on the Internet. If you guys could help out to finally put this issue to rest. "
1869,Meditation (Relaxation or breathing exercises) after exercise - Is it a good practice?,"Is it a good practice to meditate or do some breathing exercises (like Pranayam, Analom-Vilom) soon after daily gym exercise?   It felt to me that during our gym exercises the heartbeat rate increases and during meditation or breathing exercises the heartbeat rate decreases. Does it affect heart in any ways due to this irregular heartbeat?   "

But what is what?  OK, I do know that ""Fructose is a natural sugar found in a variety of foods such as fruit, honey and vegetables.""  What is normal sugar then, like the stuff you buy from the shops to put in your coffee?  Thanks "
1872,Training with a stitch is good or bad?,"Sometimes when I begin training, I get a stitch. I'm simply wondering whether there is any issue with resisting the pain and continuing?  People say that you should listen to your body if it's signalling pain etc...  Can someone provide scientific evidence on whether it's good or bad to push through it? "
1873,Seemingly useless workout,"A little background: In January of last year, I decided to shed some weight. I was then 97 Kg (213 pounds), and 1.93 meters tall (6.3 feet).  Even without working out, last September,  I weighed 82 Kg (180 pounds). (To be fair the diet has been rather blunt: I stopped eating, basically. I lost 10 Kg (22 pounds) in the first 2 months and then 5 kg (11 pounds) in the following 3. Don't know if this is relevant, anyhow). I then started working out according to the following schedule:    2 runs per week (at the beginning it was 6 Km (3.7 miles) at about 8 kph (4.97 mph). Now I do 7.5 Km (4.66 miles) at about 11 kph (6.83 mph). So it is about 40 minutes. 2 times per week a full-body workout at the gym; not going into detail here, but if you want I'll add something! Anyhow it lasts about 1 hour.   Now of course I have seen some improvement, especially at the beginning, but there are a couple of problems.  1) I don't feel so  in shape. Even if I miss one time I start to feel a little overweight, more ""heavy"" so to speak.  2) I like to play soccer, and even though running greatly increased my efficacy, I find myself heavy on the field. I can run forth and back without too much trouble, but when I have to sprint (or to kick the ball really hard), I disappoint myself. I don't feel the muscle in my legs are really ""strong"". Also, there is a great variance in how I feel when I run. Sometimes, I feel so heavy I really need to push to complete the 7.5 Km. Other times, I feel very good. I suppose this is normal (?)  3) I still have a little ""bud"" (I don't know how to say that in English, it's the fat in the lower part of the stomach just above the pelvis). It's better than before, but it is about two months that the situation seems to be stabilized (or maybe even worse a little bit). Maybe my metabolism adjusted to this workout, but what do I have to do now?  4) This is a minor point and may be just an impression, but when I went to the gym (about 2 years ago), my muscle grew much more than now. Now I am feeling that, even if the weight I lift is about the same than two years ago, my muscle are not so big. Can this be due to the running? Mind you, I am happy to have muscle which are well-defined over too big, but maybe is there something I am doing wrong?  Diet  My diet is not that great, I admit it. I don't control the portions. It's generally pasta with tuna or pasta with ragù. Or, frozen meat. No fish (except from tuna, no vegetables (I don't like them! Maybe you can advise something?) and generally not much else.  What do you advise concerning the aforementioned points? Am I asking too much, or maybe I work out too little?   Thank you in advance ;-) "
1874,Does muscles burn fats,"I am new to this site, and I am not a body builder, I am just curious about some information about fitness and muscle building.  It is well known for females to have a round big butt, they  should do squat. So that, when doing squat with a healthy nutrition intake, muscles are build, giving the desired shape.  My question is , when building muscles in a specific position of the body (let us say the butt), what happens to the fats present in this position? Does they all converted into muscles? Or  muscles are build from the enough protein intake so the fats will be kept?  Is it similar to the case of  abs fat, in which Doing crunches and other abs exercises will not burn belly fat, but just build your abs muscles?   Thank you.  "
1875,"Flat abs, Feeling tired during the day and hungry at night if I cut my regular diet","I have been trying to reduce my belly fat for the last two years without much progress, I need your counsel in trying to understand what is that I am doing wrong.  I also have issues cutting down my diet. I feel very tired during the day, and constantly feeling hungry, and also since I try to have a light dinner around 7, I have trouble falling asleep, and feel very hungry that the stomach starts making sounds by the time I get to bed around 10.  I sleep for 7-8 hours everyday, but not feeling refreshed in the morning. My job is sedentary. I think my other muscles have got stronger like arms, thighs, chest, but except that I have 4 inches of flab on my abdomen (just hate it!)  Details:  Food:   Breakfast - (250 ml) tea or coffee with milk - very little sugar + a slice of wheat bread Lunch - Usually visit subway (12 inch), Sushi, Thai restaurants (like a bowl of curry &amp; rice), take from home anything like pasta, rice, salad bars Evening - 1 banana + 1 apple or a small cup of berry when possible Dinner - Baked food, Veggies, Curries light food, sometimes a glass of Turmeric milk   Exercise:   Do cardio (running, or yoga) - 3 times a week for 30 minutes   Do weights, push-ups, pull-ups and crunches - 3 times a week for about 30 minutes Do 8-minute abs - 3 times a week    Habits   I don't smoke, have a glass of beer once every week I take vitamin supplements like B12 (morning), Fish Oil (lunch), and D3 (night) regularly.   Please, any suggestions on:   What I am doing wrong  How to minimize the hunger at night How to feel fresh in the day?  How to get the 6-pack abs? ;)   Thank you! "
1876,Should I train at what I want my best to be?,"To see results should I train where I want my result to be? For example, on Tuesdays part of my workout is 8 x 100m @ 90% effort. Should I run at my 90%, or what I want my 90% to be? This is something that I am only trying to apply to running for now.  "
1877,What is the advantage of using Olympic plates over standard ones?,"I'm lucky enough to have been gifted a half squat rack and 160kg of ""standard"" weights. I'm happy with this and not looking to upgrade in the near future but I was wondering what the advantages are of having Olympic plates?  Are these more durable? Why do novice/beginner lifters typically buy/gravitate towards them instead of the significantly cheaper standard plates? Is there an advantage to Olympic plates that I'm missing? "
1878,How do I do dips without rotator cuff pain,"I want to be able to train dips, with a goal of moving to ring dips, then muscle ups. My problem is that when I do regular dips, or machine assist dips, I get a high, consistsent level of shoulder pain.  I think the mechanism of the injury is that my shoulders rotate internally slightly, possibly because I'm trying to recruit the wrong muscles in the movement, and I get a lot of pain in my rotator cuff.  I think its also notable that, while most people describe dips as a tricep exercise, I only feel the strain in my chest muscles.  I've tried to do dips on a dip assist machine, but I have the same shoulder problems regardless of the amount of assistance I use (my theory is that the dip assist machine may be forcing me into an unnatural posture, which encourages bad technique).  When I try to do dips purely as a tricep exercise (by holding my upper arms in a fixed angle relative to my upper body, and rocking forward), my triceps aren't nearly strong enough to handle the exercise.  My shoulders tend to be fairly prone to rotator cuff problems.  Any exercise that's usually considered ""bad for shoulders"" is definitely bad for mine.  Has anyone out there experienced anything similar?  Has anyone worked through it?  My question is:   do I have a specific combination of bad dip technique and muscle weakness that needs to be addressed, and once it is, I'll be able to dip safely OR should someone who's prone to rotator cuff problems just stay away from dips entirely, and stick to benchpresses, and standing presses (neither of which cause me any shoulder pain)   I'm 6'4"", 181 lbs.  I can bench a pair of 60lbs dumbbells for 3 sets of 8, and lateral dumbbell raises with 15lbs, but other than that, haven't historically done much pressing "
1879,Adapting to exercise,"I've finally reached the point where it's harder for me not to exercise. Naturally, looking around for info, I've discovered something that was not previously known to me: recovering from workouts isn't just about rebuilding the muscles, but also about recovering from stress, and recovering some depleted resources (such as the glycogen).  I've also read that our body adapts, and the recovery time decreases, but I couldn't find anything that will help me figure out:   How quickly do we adapt? does noticeable change appear within a few weeks? a few months? a few years? How effective are things such as contrast showers/black cumin seeds etc. in shortening recovery time? (I'm not interested in sleep and diet, as there is much information available on these, and I don't consider them ways to shorten recovery rather than an essential part of recovery)   (I do not specify a specific type of workout or frequency because I'm actually interested to know how this varies with different types of workouts, not just how it's relevant to my specific workout) "
1880,How to proceed with StrongLifts after illness,"I've been doing StrongLifts for about a month now, but managed to catch the flu this week. Been horizontal for roughly a week.  How should I proceed?    Start from scratch? Move on to the next exercise as if it was just a longer rest period? Repeat the last two exercises (A and B) and then continue as normal? Deload some amount? Other ways?   Of course interested in my particular case, but more generalized answers would be nice too. Sure I'll get sick again while doing StrongLifts as I plan to try at it for a while :)    Weight: ~85kg Height: 179cm Lifted last: S 37.5kg, BP 27.5kg, BBR 37.5kg, OHP 27.5kg, DL 55kg "
1881,Will tight muscles stop you from becoming stronger or cause injuries?,"Between workouts I tend to be a little lazy about stretching, so I'm wondering if I'm hurting myself or my performance by not stretching much between workouts.  Any one of these more specific questions might help answer this if my question is too general:   As your muscles are healing between workouts do tight muscles influence recovery at all? If muscles are tight all the time then are your tendons going to be worn down, pulled off, or injured in any way? Are there any known injuries that are associated with or can be mistaken for tight muscles instead of the injury?   Specifically, I'm running a hard workout as soon as I recover so I'm living in a state of light pain all the time. If I wait an extra day then I usually find that all the pain goes away around the time I would normally do another workout. So I realize that I just lost a day of training. Which stinks so I'm curious how other thoughtful exercise freaks deal with this.  "
1882,Is Surya Namaskar Considered Dynamic Stretching,They say do Dynamic Stretching before run. Will train for Couch to 5K.  Is Surya Namaskar considered Dynamic Stretching?  Or are there other Dynamic Stretches to do in addition to Surya Namaskar?   
1883,If you consume a lot of protein but don't exercise does it go to waste?,"I recently had surgery and have been asked to avoid exercise for atleast 4 weeks. Before surgery I was doing moderate weight lifting and cardio several times a week and consuming 200 grams of protein a day mainly from eggs and shakes. I am still taking the same amount of protein daily but was wondering if it's going to waste now that I am not exercising at all.   So if one doesn't work out what happens with the protein? Does the body use just a smaller amount and expell the rest as waste or does it get stored at fat, etc.?  My weight is 180lbs and height is 5.8' "
1884,Alternating muscle groups,"This question has been asked here, but I have yet to see any explanation offered (even ""we don't know why, but it's been tried and it doesn't work"").  Will working out every day on different muscle groups cause more harm than good? If so, why?  (I avoid using the word ""overtraining"", because it seems different people take that to mean different things)  I am not asking this as it pertains to my specific workout, because I might change my workout based on the answer presented.  So far, I've found very few, contradicting answers with no explanations at all.  My goal, if you must know, is to exhaust myself so I can sleep better. I see exercise as a possible magic cure for my lack of energy. But getting stronger would also be nice. "
1885,What Are Practical Guidelines for Effective Interval Training,"What are effective guidelines for using interval training to improve distance running performance and/or maintain physical fitness?   My high school cross-country coach used to have the team run intervals once a week. Are there any guidelines or research into how often intervals should be mixed in with a runner's regular regimen to either maximize performance/endurance or reduce injury risk? I've seen many sites that discuss the benefits of this form of training, but fewer that discuss a ""standard"" regimen that can be used for a wide range of runners.  "
1886,working out at 20's,"I still can't find a good answer for this: to what extent does age matter when it comes to bodybuilding and athleticism? I've been leading a sedentary lifestyle for almost 26 and I'd like to change, is it too late to gain good mass and a good physical strength?  "
1887,Yoga for Muscle Gain?,"So, I'm not exactly a gym-going kind of guy; I like outdoor action sports like trail running and mountain biking. However, I've come to a point where all this lower body exercise has made me sort of asymmetrical (bigger toned legs and skinny arms.)   I took a yoga class once and I liked it since there was always some new stance to focus on and things weren't very repetitive, but is that a way to solve this dilemma? Am I just going to have to bite the bullet and learn to lift or are there some alternatives for an action oriented person like me? Cross fit? Tough mudder? Any help is appreciated.  "
1888,possible paths to increase bench press from 140kg (308 lbs) to 160 kg (352) - for 1o reps,"I really liked this question below and its answer.  Improving my Bench Press - what muscles are used during what phase?  I am looking for to increase my bench press from 200 kg to 220 kg.  one way I believe could work for me is instead of going heavy all the time,  I am doing now 10 reps.   currently I can do 10 reps on 140 kg.  I want to increase this to 10 reps of 160 kg.  Then I will start going heavy again.  Is there any system that supports this?   what are the possible (and proven) paths to increase the bench press for high reps? "
1889,How strict should one get with Diet to loose belly and hip fat?,"I am 6ft and currently weighing 83Kgs. I keep fluctuating on this weight from 82 to 85 kgs. I was 95kgs and managed to loose 13kgs with running, gym and rollerblading and skating.  I also made some diet changes like eating within 1200 calories limit.   But there are times I go for a party have some beer or some junk food. I leverage this by going to my regular workout. This has helped me to maintain my weight.  What I want to know is how strict should one be to loose belly and hip fat. I know there is nothing like spot reduction. Is it that if a person wants to lose fat he should eat clean, for like 6 to 12 months or till his belly is flat, without eating any junk food for the period of time. Do I have to give up all the bad food? Or is it that belly fat takes it time to lose? "
1890,Is running 10 miles twice a week too much when is combined with swimming and weightlifting?,"I went through a period of having recurring knee pain while mainly been using a treadmill. I stopped running on the treadmill and took up road running and also did more swimming. So now my current training per week is:    Swimming, high intensity, 40 minutes, 2 times. Weight lifting, all-body weights &amp; machines, 2 times. Running, 10 miles (16km), in 100 minutes, 2 times.   I'm slightly concerned that I could be over-doing it on the running. Given my history of having recurring knee pain, my question is: Am I overdoing the running?  I don't feel any ill effects from it (at the moment), but I'm also not training for a half marathon or anything like that - I just want to maximise my fitness without risking injury.  Update: I don't cycle because it aggravates my knees even more than running used to - 10 mins on the bike machine pretty much guarantees that I wake up the following night with pain the quadriceps tendon (or sometimes the lateral collateral ligament) in one of my knees (but never both). I've had my knees looked at by a few doctors but they have never gotten to the root of the problem (or even a consistent diagnosis). I had some physio a couple of months ago but it didn't help at all. It seems I've somehow managed to get lucky and settle into a program were my knees are happy ! But as I said, I just worry a bit about 100 mins running - thinking I should cut it back to maybe half the distance but faster ? "
1891,Things to do during rest days,"Currently, my workout consists of (exclusively) high-intensity exercises (some sprinting HIIT, pullups, and more).  After a few attempts at research and help from this community, I've come to accept that I can't do this every day (until recently, I was sure there's no way I would actually want to exercise every day).  However, I'm hoping that there are some things I can do in between to further some goals - such as improving balance and flexibility.  From what I understand, there are many types of stretching, and it generally don't interfere with the recovery. As for balance, from what I understand it requires the use of core muscles, so I'm guessing... don't do it if you've worked out the core muscles the day before?  So, what can I do and what shouldn't I do in my rest days? (btw, I have gymnastic rings, so...) "
1892,is it healthy for lungs to run on a sidewalk next to a busy street?,"I am trying to start running. I live in the city. I see many people running on a sidewalk next to 4 lane street/avenue.  I could help but asking myself the question, is this running healthy given the exhaust fumes from all the cars? It's like putting your mouth on an exhaust pipe!  Still, the people who run on sidewalk are so numerous. Am I wrong for thinking this is unhealthy or are they wrong for running?  (I can't afford a treadmill or a gym membership). "
1893,When doing barbell rows should I have an overhand grip or underhand grip?,"I just started doing the Strong-lifts program this week, and while researching the correct movement for each exercise I got a little confused with the barbell row. in some videos I saw it being done with an underhand grip, and in others with an overhand grip. Is there a difference between the grips? If there is, then which one is recommended to do in order to get the best results from the Strong-lifts program?  "
1894,Is there any benefit to dumbbell flys on a flat bench vs dumbbell flys on an incline bench?,So like the title says :  Is there any benefit to dumbbell flys on a flat bench vs dumbbell flys on an incline bench?  Does one position offer something the other does not? 
1895,When to begin Couch to 5K Program,"When to begin Couch to 5K Program.  I can do 108 Surya Namaskar in one sitting (takes an hour). And I can stationary bike 15 minutes at a time.  However, I have left tight hip for past 2+ weeks. I feel the discomfort when performing donkey kicks  I was told to perform dynamic stretching for relief.   Should I wait till hips are better, or can I gradually start couch to 5K now? Is there other stretches/exercises I can do to prepare for couch to 5K? Thank you. "
1896,why do we need more rest when lifting heavy?,"in relation to this question below:  possible paths to increase bench press from 140kg (308 lbs) to 160 kg (352 lbs) - for 1o reps     rest time which is around 48-72 hours at the level you are, or which   ever break suits you.   why exactly lifting heavy (at least 1.5 x body weight) makes us require more resting\recovery time?  Does it also change the metabolism? "
1897,Wheelchair users (including levers-powered) and losing weight,"Is it harder for people in wheelchairs to lose weight? The weight poses an extreme hazard to the cardiovascular system, in many cases. What can be done about it? Diet obviously plays a key, but if you cannot move, then you cannot burn the weight.  Would I be wrong?  What can a fitness trainer do about it?  If the user can use the arms, for instance, can they burn the fat contained in the stomach and legs?  Thanks. "
1898,Sprinting to increase leg size,"I have read through the numerous answers on this site for getting bulkier legs. It seems that it is largely based on genetics, aided by the type of exercise. However, I do not have access to a gym and yet, I would like to increase my leg size. My plan is to do high intensity squats. By that I mean, doing full sit-down squats 40 times in a minute and repeating this 4 or 5 times. I'm trying to replicate a sprinting uphill type scenario while I'm at home during study breaks.   Will this be helpful? Or should I employ a different method to gain leg mass? I am a vegetarian, so other things I'm doing to gain mass are drinking milk and whey protein. Any tips here also? "
1899,How much does a 400m time correlate to a good 5k race time prediction?,"The 400m distance is used to prepare for 5k races apparently, so can the times done in training be used to predict a 5k race time accurately?  If not then is racing a shorter distance the only way to predict a 5k time?  Actually this is the same as asking if there is a similar workout for 5k as the Yasso 800s workout for a marathon prediction time. "
1900,What happens to people who are sitting 8-10h per day?,"I'm a 20 year old girl and I'm an employed programmer. My job consists of so-called ""coding"" all day long. I don't want to say that I don't get off of the computer at all, but the time I spend doing something else is small.  I used to weigh like 37-42 kg; now I'm nearly 60kg. I eat what I want to eat. I've never followed any kind of regime or diet. Yet I put on some weight in the past year. I was wondering why that happened, since, in my opinion, I haven't greatly changed my lifestyle. The only thing that's different is that I go to work to sit on the computer, not like when I was in highschool. I have never intentionally exercised.   I just want to know why I put on lots of weight now when I did not before? Is it because of puberty, where I was growing and using a lot of resources? Or is it that my body can't handle that much of physical inactivity?  My logical thinking cannot understand that the lifestyle was always the same, but the body's reaction are different. Can someone explain this? "
1901,What does the drive phase of running stride mean?,"From [website]  Dorsiflexed Foot      What is the first stride key you think about during the drive phase of   your running stride? You probably think of either lifting, driving or   pulling your knee up and through. That is a good stride key but there   may be a better one. How about first raising your toes? When you raise   your toes you are dorsiflexing your foot at your ankle. If you   concentrate on dorsiflexing your foot you are putting your foot in the   proper position for a flat footed touchdown, pre stretching your calf   to maximize energy return and are also encouraging a “triple response”   in which your knee and hip flex into proper running stride position.   I was wondering what ""the drive phase of your running stride"" mean when the quote suggests to dorsiflex foot? Is it the phase when one foot leaves the ground,  the leg moves forward, but the foot hasn't landed yet? Thanks! "
1902,What does very much sweating mean?,"Every time I do sports, I sweat really much - no matter whether I play soccer or do some bodyweight exercises. My fitness level is quite good and I don't get out of breath that easyly, but still I am sweating very much every time. What could be the reason for this? Does it mean that I am not as fit as I think I am? Other people, who don't have a fitness level like me don't seem to sweat very much. I am a little confused about what all that means. Should I have my heart circulation system checked or something like that? "
1903,What assessments would you recommend prior to working out?,"What assessments would you recommend taking prior to you (or someone you workout with) takes prior to working out?

1904,Shrugs - To roll or not to roll?,"This is going to be a short question, because there's very little depth to it.  I've been bulking lately, and to have something to focus on, aesthetically, my shoulder region is getting some love. And with it; traps!  I've been doing more shrugs lately, but while doing them, I can't figure out what's best; to do rolling shrugs, or just straight up-and-down shrugs?  Do anyone have any good advice, one way or the other? Preferably backed up with some sort of study. Anecdotes are alright depending on the source. "
1905,Recovery from different exercise types,"I am no exercise addict, but I do have the willpower to exercise almost every day. Hell, I'll even exercise twice daily! Though I suspect I shouldn't.  I've read a bit about exercise recovery (I'd like to say ""A lot"", but by comparison, I suspect it's not that much). There's a lot of emphasis about exercise recovery.  What do we need to recover from? I know our body starts out using glycogen (first the glycogen stored in the muscle, then the liver?), and if we continue to cause trauma to the muscle without letting it heal properly first, we will lose more than we gain. But how much time do we need to recover from different types of exercise?  For example, I've come across claims that you should get a day's rest between HIIT sessions. However, in the Tabata study (I have very little patience. a 4-minute workout? PERFECT! though I do get too close to vomiting...), the subjects worked out 5 days a week (4 days a week on the Tabata protocol, 1 day 30-min endurance followed by half the tabata protocol - 4 sets), which means at least 2 consecutive days of HIIT.  So the question is, what does one need to recover from, and how long would it take for, say, someone who isn't especially well-conditioned? (of course, I know this is variable, so I don't expect a precise answer. I'm asking for you to shed as much light as you can on the subject :) ) "

1907,How do male gymnasts train in order to get muscular?,"Having learnt a bit about weightlifting programs using barbells and other stuff, now I wonder how male gymnasts train in order to become muscular and strong. Do they use weights in the same way as bodybuilders and power lifters do?  I know those guys train from their very early childhood, but surely the principles can be adapted and they could be useful to some extent for people in other life circumstances. "
1908,Weight lifting stunts growth?,"I just reached out to ask you guys' ideas on weight lifting stunt growth myth. I am 15 years old, and I am 5""7"" tall. I've been working out since last month, and I use a pair of dumbbells which is a bit heavy for me. I used to do overhead presses and bench presses, but was forced to stop it. So, I minimized my workout to the basics, and now I'm only doing push ups, dips, hammer curls, and dumbbell bicep curls. However, there still are people warning me and I wanted to make sure if this won't stunt my growth.  My question is 1. Do overhead presses or bench presses stunt growth? 2. Do push up, dips, hammer curl, dumbbell bicep curls stunt growth? 3. Are there any other exercises that stunt growth? "
1909,"What are some preventives or palliatives for vocal cord strain (from ""overuse"")?","I am going to be delivering a lecture 75-80 minutes in length. In practicing it lately, I find that my throat/vocal cords are a little fatigued afterwards and sometimes during the rehearsal. I'm not used to talking that much or for that long.  Is there something I can do either to help prevent this strain (exercises? drink orange juice? beer?) or to help soothe my pipes afterwards, to be ready for the next vocal marathon?  I may eventually do a couple of these performances per week, and I find that my voice sounds better when it's rested and ""strong."" It starts sounding ""overworked"" and croaky otherwise.  I thought of asking this on the ""health"" site, but figure that is more about illnesses and ailments, whereas this question is more about fitness, perhaps. "
1910,Negative consequences to training with IT band injury?,"Around 6 weeks ago I started to get pain in my IT band.  I tried resting with stretching for 2 weeks almost immediately after the injury, and the problem has persisted.  Currently I'm swimming 3 times a week, occasionally cycling and trying to get running again.  I have been trying to stretch before and after workouts and this seems to help relieve the pain at first, however it is noticable (if not very bad) after 2/3km and painful at 5.  My question is are there negative consequences to training with the injury?  ie, if i continue to run, with lots of stretching, am i going to gradually lengthen/loosen the IT band, or am i just going to make the problem worse?  In addition to specifically running, should I still cycle and swim, Help! "
1911,Body weight readjustment (post-(exercise fat burn)),"A friend of mine told me you burn fat on one area of the body, and then the body weight readjusts itself so as to maintain the same proportions within a week or ten days or so of you quitting the exercise routine.

1912,Kung Fu + Gym = Bad Idea?,"I've been regularly going to the gym around 3 - 5 times a week.  I do not do crazy workout like some other people.  I only do resistance training enough to may be build some muscle in a few months.  I just joined Kung Fu class and the instructor told me that it was a bad idea to do both Kung Fu and go to the Gym as it will make by body be disproportionate  and cause back pain.  Is that true?  If it is under what circumstances?  i.e. how much work is too much?  As for myself, I am 32 years old and 6'3"" weight around 200 pounds.  I am already a bit muscular, i.e. I am able to incline press 200 pounds for 16 reps.  Edit 1: I plan on doing 1 - 2 Kung Fu sessions a week.  Each sessions is about an hour. "
1913,Pilates: Trouble sitting with legs straight. How should I adapt the exercises?,"When doing Pilates, I find it very difficult to sit on the mat with my legs straight in front of me. Due to my tight hamstrings and lower back, my centre of gravity is behind my bottom, so I will naturally fall backwards.  I have a DVD/book routine that I follow, with exercises such as the sitting hundred, spine twist and rowing. How am I best to adapt them considering that I feel so unbalanced with my legs straight?   Should I struggle through, as this will help to loosen the muscles? Should I get support for my back? Can I bend my legs until I am balanced? Or should I avoid these exercises entirely for the time being?  "
1914,Elbow movement during Rippetoe Press,"When doing a (standing, overhead) press as described in Starting Strength, are your elbows supposed to stay in a vertical plane, under your hands and in front of your hands (more or less), staying at the same distance from each other as you press the bar up?  Or should they travel out, away from each other some, during the movement?  When I do it, my elbows tend to flare out some.  I think this changes the muscle recruitment in the exercise.  I'm not sure if this is a form error that I should correct (reducing the weight if needed), or if I should just ignore it.  I didn't see this fully addressed in Starting Strength, but I may have missed it.  Rippetoe talks at length about a proper vertical bar path, and all the photos of people doing the lifts are profile shots, never straight on.  Thanks. "
1915,Tense neck muscles,"Background: I work as a programmer, so I probably have a few posture related issues. I try to sit back as much as possible and relax shoulders and head, which has helped in getting rid of most of my back pains, but when I get home I don't pay much attention to it, for example I lying on one side a lot. I have been working out more than my usual this year, which seems to have brought out the issue.  Coming to my problem, the muscles in my neck feel tense most of the time, the range of motion is slightly reduced compared to 1 year ago because of said tension, whether it's lifting my head up or turning it to one side (one side more than the other). I feel most of the tension in the sternocleidomastoid, and occasionally the soreness hits the top of the trapezius as well. Push-ups or small weight lifting are usually enough to make me feel it even more.  Is there anything I should exlude from my workout at least for a brief time period? What can I do to prevent this from happening and relax these muscles? "
1916,"Tips to lose fat without running, jogging etc (have bad knee)","I am 27. I have a bad knee from doing dead lifts. Its osteoarthritis the doctor says, so not only did I give up deads but also am refraining from running or other such activities that take a toll on the knee.  I however do benches, OHPs etc which give a fair bit of fat burn but aren't at the level that deads and running would do. Bagwork too is so-so. May be I have to just give it time?  So, having eschewed some of the best fat burning exercises since past 6 months, what other exercise options do I have to get rid of the generous amount of fat thats hiding my big muscles by burning loads of calories? Any interesting circuits that has enough variety to not bore me?  I have a healthy balanced diet that I adjusted after foregoing deads and consume far less calories now. If I reduce it any further I might become tiresome I fear.  Thanks.  PS: I am not obsessed to have a single digit bf% but need to get rid of jiggly stuff and God do I hate those love handles!  "
1917,Calorie counter on an exercise machine is it actual or approximation?,"On any machine that gives you the amount of calories burnt,  is the calorie count actual or approximation based on weight / effort? If it is an approximation, any idea on what would be the average +/- error range?  Or is it too negligible to even consider it even when using it for 1000 calories? "
1918,Relieve muscle tension between the shoulder blades,"I got some pain between the shoulder blade and spinal for a week now. It's not really a strong pain, but it really bothers me over time. My doctor did feel my muscles there and said its a muscle tension (from my own research I'm pretty sure the muscle is called trapezius). Doc also said I should ask the trainer at my gym for some advice, because he thinks the trainer has more knowledge about that. I asked the trainer, but he just said straight into my face that there's nothing I could do except for just wait till the tension releases itself (which I don't believe).  Does anyone know any way to relieve this tension, maybe from own experience? Perhaps some stretching or something? "
1919,How are calories calculated in food,"How are calories calculated in food?   Do they sum all the energy in every molecule? By for example, by burning the stuff up and calculating the energy output.  Or is this value supposed to represent the energy that a human body will extract from that food?  Or do they only sum up the elements that we are supposed to digest (Protein, Carbs, Fat) ?  For example, wood contains a lot of energy. We can see that by burning it. But the human body is not able to break done the fibers to extract the enery from wood. We do not eat  wood but I suppose there are multiple elements contained in food that we do not digest but that contain energy.  Also, Fat contains a lot of energy compared to carbs or proteins but the human body has a much more difficult time to process fat and extract energy from it (catabolism).   Is it the energy outputed from the catabolism of fat that is calculated or again the theoretical quantity energy in fat (burning it). "
1920,Will this be 'Overtraining'?,"Right now I am doing a 5x5 workout 3 times a week. However I want to workout more frequently (maybe 4-5 days a week).   My current workout routine is something like this:   Monday (Squat, Deadlift), Wednesday (Bench Press, Overhead Press, Bent-Over Rows) Friday (Squat and Deadlift again)  Since squat and deadlift workout a lot of upper body muscles, would changing my current routine to something like below be considered as 'over training'?  Monday (Squat, Deadlift), Tuesday (Bench Press, Overhead Press), Thursday (Squat, Deadlift) Friday(Benchpress, Bent-Over Rows)  I do some minor isolation exercises after doing the major exercises each workout.   So what do you think community? Will the big compound movements exercises be too much for my body to handle for 4 days a week?  "
1921,Is there any benefit to Touch-and-Go Deadlifts?,"As per the question title, is there any benefit to doing touch-and-go deadlifts rather than the more ""full"" reset deadlifts? That is, does the touch-and-go variant provide any specific benefits to training over that of the reset variety? "
1922,What are the consequences of just eating sandwiches for breakfast and lunch?,"I've wondered a long time if eating cereals with chocalate, honey and sandwiches with sandwich filling like jam, peanut butter, chocalate, syrup, cheese, salami etc. would be bad or good or maybe just neutral.     So what are the consequences (both positive and negative) of just eating sandwiches for breakfast and lunch almost all the time?    Note: I'm a student and it's very hard for me to study and work at the same time to pay for the food. I recently hired a personal trainer and made him draft a diet. I soon realized it would cost me around €250,00 (appr. $289.5) per month which is something I can't keep up with.      Bonus question : So what tips do you have for me to get the nutrients I need?   EDIT:  I follow a power (strength) training as it is called in my language. [Monday and Friday] Chest: Benchpress (close and wide grip both 4 sets of 10 reps), Dumbbell Flyes (15 reps), Superset that consists of Cable crossover (slightly below shoulder line), Push-ups and then Low cable front raises (all 15 reps). They are performed directly after eachoter. Then Prone 45° Incline reverse-grip Barbell front raises (12 reps) last but not least Prone 45° barbell spider curls (8 reps). (Tuesday and Saturday) Back: Seatle Cable row (5 sets of 10 reps), Bent Over Barbell Row ( 6 sets of 14, 10, 7, 7, 10, 14 reps (20, 25 and 30 kg) ),Assisted Pull-up, Lat Pull down, Superset (Dumbell Row and Cable one arm lateral raise), Triceps revers grip pushdown,  Lying barbell Triceps Extension.  (Wednesday) Leg day: Leg extension Machine, Single leg press, Barbell Squat, leg press, seated leg curl, lying hamstring curl.  Abbs I try to do as much as I can .     P.S.:   I do however take protein shakes (True Mass BSN; 35 grams before the training and 40 grams after within a 30 minute-time interval). But I'm planning to stop doing that. My sandwiche is just one slice of bread fold in half. It's not like this but more like this. One slice of bread weighs 34 grams. I often eat the brown ones.   "
1923,Why way more carbs are required for bodybuilding than fat?,"Both carbs and fat end up getting converted into the same chemical energy used by the body to power muscle repair, so why is it always recommended in macronutrient calculators to eat more carbs than fat?  Is it a matter of how fast the conversion takes? (I don't think so since many articles emphasise how nutrition timing is largely irrelevant). I'm confused. "
1924,Is there concrete evidence that running during our first few decades helps with longevity beyond age 90?,"I love running. I run regularly and competitively. In my early years, teachers and family told me it was the best thing I could do if I want to live long (together with good diet).   But more and more I've been hearing about the wear and tear it does to the body (not just on the joints, but also on the heart).  I think it goes without question that running keeps us healthy for the first few decades of our lives, but it seems the number of runners dying before 90 or 100 is relatively much larger than in other groups of people, for example:  In this comprehensive list of oldest surviving athletes, only 3 are runners (2 long-distance and one 400m), whereas for sports that are much less intense on the cardiovascular system we have far more. There's 27 baseball players (according to this, they barely run[1]) and 13 gymnasts. There are far more runners than baseball players or gymnasts (baseball is only popular in a few countries, and gymnastics requires training and equipment that not everyone has access to), so comparatively, more runners are dying before age 100 than average.  The other cardiovascular sports also have very low proportions of people surviving to 100: 5 cyclists, 2 swimmers, 3 rowers.   There should be far fewer world leaders than professional runners, but 17 world leaders have survived to 100 and the latest data shows only 3 professional runners. Likewise there's more professional runners than physicists, chemists or mathematicians but there's 14, 15, and 16 of them surviving to 100 respectively. There's also been 18 pianists, 36 composers, and 20 singers that survived to 100, but it seems only 3 runners.  For me and all the runners out there, I ask if there's any (credible) studies on the longevity of competitive runners? If not what are some of the scientifically accepted LONG-TERM health effects of running?   Footnotes:  [1] ""Some New Yorkers walk a greater distance to work each day than the average player runs during a game, which is likely less than half a mile even for multiple home run hitters and fielders. The bases are only 90 feet apart"" from this article.  "
1925,I need an advice about a training,"I'm new here. I'm 67kg and I'm fine with my body, it's pretty normal, but I don't like 2 things. The problem is that I have a hard belly and my bum looks big from a side. What should I eat or do? Any advice? (I don't eat much by the way) "
1926,How to exercise for kyphosis?,"I have a slight kyphosis and I have seen this, this and other videos as beneficial exercises. My questions are:   What should be the weekly workout plan for these exercises? Should it be once a day, everyday of the week or something else? Should I do stretching before, after or before&amp;after these exercises? If yes, how should the proper stretching for this be done? (a link to a video would be awesome) After getting used to these exercises, should I increase weight, repetitions or both?  "
1927,How to keep flexibility with weight training?,"I heard that weight training will lower a person's flexibility over time. How to preserve the flexibility while getting stronger? Is the answer taking up yoga classes at the same time? Or, is there an option without this? "
1928,Should I rest completely or just tone it down?,"I've gotten into running recently and I really like it. However, my body just isn't having it and whenever I run longer than about a mile and a half, my knees just kill me. Yesterday, I had to lay down in the grass for like 20 minutes because of the pain. My friends said that I need to lay off for a week or so, but I really don't want to. If it's important, putting something cold just under my knees helps them feel better. Also, I feel like there's some inflammation because it almost looks like there's fat under my kneecaps.  Does anyone know what's wrong with me? And what should I do to fix it?  EDIT: I'm 5'11"" and 135 lbs. I try to run everyday from 7:30-8:30 and I have some Men's Nike Free 5.0 running shoes. These ones: [website]"
1929,I can row more than I can squat. Am I doing something wrong?,"I've been doing barbell strength training for a few months. I've been doing some progression programs and trying to improve my form. After a few form checks with professionals, I am confident that my squat form is pretty decent (for a novice) as is my barbell row.   However, that means that my squat is lower than my row. As an example, today I rowed  77.5 kg (~170 lbs) for 3 sets of 6, and I could only manage to keep good form with 72.5 kg for 5 sets of 3 for my (back)squats, ATG.  I conclude (also confirmed from how it feels when squatting and deadlifting) that I have an imbalance and that my legs, i.e. quadriceps mostly, are weaker in relative terms than my back. However, if I look at the strength standards, it still seems strange that my squat for my weight level is at a beginner's level, and my row close to intermediate, even if I would say I'm probably best described as novice.  [website][website]My question is, can this be possible? Can I have such a big imbalance, or does it mean I'm definitely doing something wrong somewhere? If it's just an imbalance, will that correct itself if I keep just progressively overloading, or should I take action to correct that imbalance?   For context, I'm ~87kg 188cm (that's ~191 lbs, at 6'2) male, 28 yrs old. "
1930,Is running barefoot on pavement beneficial or detrimental to flat feet?,"I have been told by the doctor that barefoot walking is good as long as it is on a rugged surface (grass, gravel, sand, ...) but I should not walk barefoot on a pavement or home.  Simultaneously, there is advice encouraging bare foot running for flatfooters. The arguments are that it encourages the runner to land and take off the front part of the leg, instead of the heel, thus reducing pronation during the running session itself and strenghtening the calf, thus preventing further pronation.  My problem is that I live in an area, where it is impossible to find a long enough patch of rugged surface. All my running sessions are approximately 4 km, out of which only 1.5 is on a rugged surface, the rest is on pavement. I have been running for 2 months barefoot, so far so good, but I would like to know the long term effect of this.   Is there some research on the topic? Do you have some personal experience? "
1931,Post workout carbs,"The general advice is that after resistance training you should consume plenty of simple carbs to spike your insulin level and thus help getting nutrients to your muscles (and to replenish your glycogen stores).  However, insulin is also responsible for storing excess calories as body fat which is clearly a bad thing and should be avoided as much as you can even when you're bulking.  Recent research also indicates that you don't need to skyrocket your insulin level since it gives no extra benefit, so a low-GI food with protein (e.g. whey shake and some fruit) should also do the job. E.g.: Alan Aragon's Research Review  So what's the truth?  Should we skip simple carbs post workout? "
1932,High weights at shoulder barbell press,"I was attentioned at the gym today by a ""gym bro"" that doing shoulder presses with the barbell at a total of 50kg barbell + weigths is dangerous and nobody should do it. I am doing 5x5 reps and i find the 50 kg weigth comfortable. Should i worry about something ? Is it too exagerated to do shoulder press with 50 kg? "
1933,What is a suitable gym routine for woman to achieve a toned body?,"As summer is arriving, does anyone have any suggestions for a gym routine for a female? My gym has most equipment. I want to tone up and have a leaner figure. Any exercise  suggestions (cardio, strength) or timetables would be greatly appreciated!   Also, how many times a week is it best to train to see results?  "
1934,advice for male turning 40+,"I've been weight and martial art training for a few years now, on and off.  Having turned 40 recently, and over the years noticing changes like longer recovery times etc, I was wondering if there are specific age-related pieces of advice relating to weight training and general fitness anyone here might have?  Specifically, for the 40+ males, is there anything one should do to maintain the health of / prevent injury of joints and tendons and anything one should do to aid recovery - or even reductions in training? "
1935,Best ways to add explosive strength to a barbell training/HIT program?,"I am a 45 year old male. For 2 months I have been training weights acccording to the Starting Strength program twice a week. That is except for the power clean which I have not been doing yet. My strength has been improved quite a bit. However when I was younger I could jump up and place my hand around the rim of a basketball hoop. I tried this today and was nowhere near this. So I want to improve my explosive strength. I am therefore looking for a few simple but effective exercises for building explosive strength with emphasis on jumping and sprinting.  I understand the power clean is one way to do this. However when Mark Rippetoe wrote his excellent book he choose to restrict himself by the subtitle: ""Basic Barbell Training"". So there may be better ways to train explosive strength but he could not include them in his book.  Another way may be box jumps and medicine ball high wall throws. These exercises seem less technical challenging than power clean. I read this article: Hang Cleans vs. Weighted Jumps in which the author Joe Defranco claims that weighted jumps are safer and have more carryover than power cleans. Seems it is easy to hurt ones wrist doing power cleans.  I assume I would be doing these exercise before I do my squats and deadlifts?  I also do interval running for 30 minutes twice a week. My strength sessions already take 1 h so I don't want to prolonge them by much. Could I add these exercises to the end of my interval running? I experimented with adding sprints to the end of my running today. Seems to train the muscles quite well.  "
1936,I want to increase my height (teen girl) with the help of excercise routines and diet,I am a 15 year old girl and 5'5 in height. How can I increase my height in terms of food and exercise?

1937,Are Vibram FiveFinger shoes good for biking?,"Preface: I've used a standing desk before and loved it, I'm going to switch back very soon. I also bike every day, my commute is at least 9.8 miles. The bike I use has cages on the pedals and I'm currently using new balance running training shoes (that I've barely used for running). I also want to bike longer distances.  I would like to use Vibrams as my only pair of shoes for biking 13+ miles a day and standing most of the day.  Will Vibram shoes be good for biking? Or will they negatively affect my biking? And corollary to my use: Are they good for standing while working? "
1938,How to keep full face,"Few years back I was 110lbs at 5'4"" . I was able to eat any junk, tiny clothes fit but face was skinny and I needed makeup to look healthy.  Life happened I am nearly 140lbs. Only good part is face filled up and it looks much better --- no need for makeup!  Now I am been exercising, i.e. challenging myself to lift heavier weights, do more intensive cardio, etc.   Takes about 30 min a day, and when done I feel I got a super workout --- plus I watch what I eat (if I even have appetite ...)  Question --- how to keep same full face while burning the extra fat and strengthening muscles? Is this even an issue? Or will it take care of itself considering I am doing arm and shoulder exercise?  Please advise. "
1939,Is Isolation Work really useless?,"Under a question in this stack I someone commented under the answer I gave, that additional isolation work is useless (+ providing some studies about it).  The example reffered to Squats as compound a movement with Leg Extensions and Leg Curls as further isolation work for the Legs. In the provided studies, the conclusion was that the difference in muscle growth and strength between the compound-group of testsubjects and the compound-and-isolaton-group was under 1%.  Studies: [website]I can't really imagine how isolation work would be completely useless, when trying to build muscle and/or get stronger. So I'm trying to get this to a wider audience.  Is it true, that isolation work does pretty much not contribute to muscle growth or strength, given you already do the compound movements (like squats, deadlifts, bench press, etc.)? Or am I misunderstanding something here? "
1940,High Heel in weightlifting shoes,"After much urging, I bought some Wei-Rui weight lifting shoes.  But I found my deadlift in them became much worse, not better.  A friend told me that the high heel in them ruins the deadlift.  He told me I was better off deadlifting (and squatting, for that matter) bare foot than in shoes with a heel.  (He said the heel is good for olympic lifts where you snatch.  I'm just doing general Starting Strength squat, deadlift, press, and bench).  Is he right? Should I get rid of the Wei-Rui and just lift barefoot? Or get a different pair? How should I find shoes that work for my (beginner's) program? "
1941,Calisthenics how many skills?,"Most people suggest to train one skill at once, but wouldn't  it work just fine by doing one skill per bodypart?  Training multiple  skills at once   Hamstrings= Nordic curls Quadriceps= Matrix squat   Or  First learning the nordic curl and then the matrix squat and so on.  Which is better? "
1942,1000 push-ups a day to lose body fat?,"I am trying to lose some body fat. Currently 173 cm, 82 kg. I am on a ""no carbonated beverages"" diet and keeping my calories as low as possible. I am not trying to lose weight. Gaining muscle is good for me.  I currently do not have access to a gym and I can't go out (too cold outside), no chin-up bar either. Can't do jump-roping to wake up the neighbors (the suburban jail cells we live in these days, sigh).   So I decided to have a personal goal of 1000 push-ups a day. I'm currently at 150 a day. I'm not sure if this counts as high-volume training and I have no clue about the outcome once I reach 1000.   How much will 1000 push ups a day help in losing body fat? Am I overdoing this? Or is doing pushups just not an effective compound exercise? "
1943,"When is the ""220 - age"" formula valid to check the HR max?","Going through an answer to Clear cut explaination of threshold training I found a useful answer, where this was stated:     Now, since you had a doctor do your HR zones, you may actually have a decent idea of your HR max. (Ignore 220-age, it's meaningless drivel. I'm 51 now and I can still hit 190. It was originally based on bad science, and repeated because it was easy). Your AnT [Anaerobic Threshold] is going to probably be in the neighborhood of 80-85% of your HR max, but that's not 100% given.   Me being a runner, I have used this formula sometimes to calculate how intense my efforts should be. Then, some time before engaging into more intense training, I did a professional test and the results were almost the same than 220 - my age.  I've seen this formula being used normall in some answers to this site (see them in Should my running be aerobic or anaerobic? or What is my target training heart-rate?), so I wonder:  I don't want at all to make a critic on the answer, only that I would like to dig a bit more into details: When can we use this formula? What is the usefulness of the formula? What is the bad science it was based on? "
1944,"Do ""barefoot"" runners need a different warm-up?","I normally run 10-15 km training runs. My warm-up has always been nothing more than starting very slowly- I run the first 3 km at a crawl, really. A few months ago I switched to ""barefoot"" running, and I've been warming up in the same way. But then I managed to injure myself (as I detailed in this question) despite having done my normal warm-up.  There are two excellent questions here about running warm-ups - one is a general question, and this one is about the intensity of the warm-up.  My question is this- does (long distance) barefoot running require a different warm-up from regular running? Did anyone here make changes to their warm-up as a result of switching to barefoot running? "
1945,Optimum rep duration for muscle/size gains,"I've searched high and low for this, but all I could find was articles on the best number of reps and sets (rep and set range etc.)  But how long should one rep be for maximum hypertrophy, given, say, a 5x5 routine (does that change for more reps/sets?)?  Additionally, what is the most effective rest period between reps within a set?  Of course this depends on the individual, as does everything else, but are there any studies or recommended values? "
1946,Benefits of different kinds of Cardio for Warmup,"I'm going to the gym regularly for weight lifting for half a year now. I incorporate some light cardio (5 min) and a muscle specific warmup with an elastic band into my workout routine to get blood flowing and prepare my muscles for the exercises.  Now to the question: Is there any difference between let's say the treadmill, the crosstrainer and the bicyclewhen looking at warmup? Maybe there are benefits or drawbacks using one of these other the other? I'm only doing bicycle right now and was wondering about that. "
1947,"During bulking phase, do the extra calories power weight lifting or mass building?",I suppose we need extra energy for both lifting weights at the gym in order to stimulate mass building AND the actual process of mass building between gym sessions.   But I can't find good articles that distinguish between the two: how much of that extra energy goes to lifting and how much to building? Is it 50/50? Is there any research on this topic?

However, when travelling, which is a considerable part of my life, I won't be able to bring one with me due to A) Weight B) opportunity to hang it.  What equivalent equipment should I carry to substitute it? I expect that it fits in any flying luggage allowance. That is, it should not weight more than 10 pounds (and that's already a lot).   Could a water punching bag be of any use if you can't hang it? I was thinking about a kind of mixed exercise, lifting the bag and punching (hooks and jabs) it a couple of times in the air.  "

To save the monthly cost, I was considering getting some dumbbells and doing workouts at home three or four times a week.  At the moment, I go the gym three or four times a week, doing mainly cardio (rowing machine and cross trainer) and a bit of free weights (3 sets of 10 reps). This is because I'm not after muscle gain, I'm just trying to keep fit.  Is it sensible/possible to have a keep fit work out with dumbbells? I've seen people claiming that their regime is a full body work out, but is that enough to keep me fit?  "
1957,What should I eat or drink before jogging?,"I'm planning to run at least 5 times a week with the aim to lose weight and improve my overall health. Now I want to know how should prepare myself with regards to eating and drinking to get the most out of my run.  I guess that means: to be able to run harder and longer - and indeed, caring about wear and tear on your body. For example should I:   Drink water or not drink before?   Eat immediately before, or a long time before?   Eat bananas for their potassium   Consume drinks with electrolytes  Take any specific vitamins or minerals?     How is one supposed to prepare one's self for jogging? "
1958,Recommended amount of cardio exercise,"For cardiovascular health (not training, or endurance, or other reasons for exercising), how frequently is it recommended to do cardio? What is the minimum to have any effect, what is the maximum where not much is gained, and what is optimal?  Or to phrase it in a different way, is jogging for 15 minutes once a week any better than doing no exercise at all? Is running for three hours a day better than one hour a day? For a healthy lifestyle, how often should cardio be done? Again, I'm asking about exercising for cardiovascular health, not building stamina or training for a sport. "
1959,Are neutral-grip pull-ups as effective as standard pull-ups?,"Are neutral-grip pull-ups, where the palms are facing each other, easier than standard pull-ups? Are they harder? Or could neutral-grip pull-ups be a perfect alternative to standard pull-ups, as if when someone does not have a pull-up bar, for example?   Thank you.  "
1960,Should I stretch before exercising?,"Should stretching be done before exercise? Does the type of exercise (running, weight training, swimming) affect the answer? "
1961,Why is a warm-up routine important before beginning a workout?,"Three part question.   Why is a warm up routine important before beginning a workout session? Should one warm up differently for different types of exercises (cardio/strength) Is it harmful to not warm-up before exercising, does it have an effect on the end result?  "
1962,Why do distance running training programs tell you to do long runs so slowly?,"I'm trying to improve my times in the half marathon and the marathon, so I've been reading a lot of training plans for races at those distances.  One thing I've noticed is that most of these programs tell you to do your long training runs quite slowly, often recommending 60-90 seconds per mile slower than your target race pace.  Why is that?  That is, it seems like if I want to become a faster runner at a certain distance, the best way to train would be to run that distance, quickly.  Yet most plans instruct you to do your long runs slowly, and to build speed in separate, shorter workouts.  I can see the benefit of doing shorter workouts at a faster pace, but I don't see how doing my long runs at 60 seconds/mile slower than my goal pace is going to help me as much as doing them at as close to my goal pace as I can handle.  Isn't that how most training works?  So why is that?  Is it just to keep my legs fresh for other workouts?  (If so, then couldn't I run faster if I know I'm going to have a day or two of rest following my long run due to my schedule?)  And is there empirical evidence to support that these long, slow runs train athletes better than faster runs of the same distance?  Or is it just unquestioned coaching orthodoxy?  Edit: There are some good answers below, but I haven't accepted any of them because thus far no one has been able to point to any scientific studies.  They may not exist; they often don't for this type of thing (it's almost baffling how little hard, scientific evidence we have for so many of our most deeply held beliefs regarding fitness and exercise).  That's what I'm hoping to find, at any rate. "
1963,Lesser evil when it comes to snacks: sweet vs salty,"For the past year I have drastically changed my eating habits (for better if I may say so) and I'm currently training twice a week and doing cardio once/twice per week. However, I still occasionally fall for snacks.  Is there a good scientific reason to prefer one over another. E.g. 50g bag of Lays vs 50g Snickers bar? From what I can see on the wrappings, calories are more or less same. Only difference for me is that chips last longer.  So except trying to avoid them, is any of the categories ""more healthy"" than the other and why? "
1964,Running with a backpack,"I carpool to work in the mornings but I run home after work. I have tried running with a regular backpack but that didn't work. It bounced up and down too much and wore out my shoulders. I am now running with my small camelback but that only has room for a cellphone and wallet. Because with the camelback my load is so small, I have worked out an elaborate system to get my stuff back home to me.   My solution would be to find a good backpack that doesn't bounce when I run so I can just take my stuff with me when I run home.   Any suggestions on which backpacks are good for running? Any tips on how to run with a backpack on so I don't screw up my back or something? "
1965,Should/How-do I reduce the time at threshold HRM,"Background:   I'm reasonably fit, I run and cycle fairly regularly (at least 10k run total a week and 40k cycle) as well as some weightlifting (3x a week, currently running GSLP).   My running schedule usually consists of:   5K race once a week (parkrun). 5-10k endurance 'jog' (very comfortable pace). 40mins interval/hill-repeats.   This weekend I did a 14k run for the first time at a comfortable jogging pace. I have done 6-7 10k runs in the last 6 months but had got some energy gels and wanted to push to a higher number with a view to doing a half-marathon next year. My 5k race pace is 5:10min/km and my 10k relaxed pace is 6:20min/km  I also recently invested in a heart-rate monitor (HRM) from Wahoo fitness (I have also checked its data against another HRM to confirm my findings). I used it on this run and knowing my maximum measured heart rate (from interval training) as 200...     Surely something is wrong? I could have happily continued running for at least another 5k.    Question: Would continuing to train at this intensity on my endurance runs eventually lead to a reduction in AvgHR?  Also,  Is this a sensible HR graph for a half-marathon?  Are the heart rate zones about right? If not, how could I work them out?  Should I re-evaluate what is a ""comfortable pace""? "
1966,Is hypoventilation training bad for health?,"Hypoventilation training, pioneered by Emil Zátopek, is a training method by which one first inhale, then exhale normally, then hold his breathe.  Wikipedia notes that hypoventilation training delays acidosis and thus delay on onset of fatigue, allowing one to improve performance during strenuous exertions of short to moderate durations.   However, what are the disadvantages or side-effects of hypoventilation training (besides physically demanding)?  Specifically, is engaging in long-term hypoventilation training hazardous to health? "
1967,How much significant growth occurs on rest days?,After the moment you wake up after a workout day how much actual significant muscle growth occurs in the 24 hours ahead?   Or are rest days to prevent over training and full restoration of strength? 
1968,Do slowly lifting heavy weights increase general power/speed/impact without weights?,"If someone wants to increase his power/speed at performing a certain movement in sports (for example, tennis shots, golf strike, kicking a ball), would slowly lifting heavy weights (almost at the point of failure, if you want) help him achieve his goal?   I'm confused by the whole slow/fast twitching muscles and wonder how slow movements loading a muscle can improve the mirror movement (that is, fast with little load). How do each type of exercise relate to strength vs power? "
1969,How to stop relying on dominant leg in squat?,"For a while I've noticed that I lean a lot on my right leg during my squats and it went on for a while.  I am currently squatting 200lbs, which is great, but lowering all the way down to 145 and I still notice that I am cheating on my right side. I took a hit to my ego dropping this low, but it is for the better and I will keep lowering my weight until I find a spot where my form is correct (95lbs is fine during warm up).  Last week, I added unilateral leg press and this made it very clear that my left leg is weaker than my right. My left glute is definitely weaker too.  What should I do to help with my form? Is unilateral workouts the way to go until I fix this imbalance and my squat form? "
1970,Muscle size and explosivity,"Seeing guys like Bruce Lee, there doesn't seem to be any correlation between muscle size and explosive power. Is this correct?  In terms of musculature, how does the body create explosive power? "
1971,Increasing resistance vs increasing speed?,"I am new to HIIT and would like to gain the most our of it. I mostly do indoor cycling for my HIIT workouts. As I am progressing, it is better to increase resistance or increase speed ?  Use case :  Let's say right now I use resistance level 3 and reach about 28 mph during the 20 seconds interval, Should I increase to resistance level 4 while maintaining  same speed or stay at the same level and increase speed ?  Thank you, Martin  "
1972,How to properly track weights on bodyweight exercises?,"I'm tracking my weights for every exercise I'm doing in my workout routine, so that I can see when I'm improving and increasing the weights or even when I had to decrease the weight indicating maybe I need more rest.  I always wondered a little when tracking the weights for bodyweight exercises. Obviously the weight for a Pull-Up or One-Legged Standing Calf Raise would be my own weight (about 75kg) + the additional weight (if using any). That is because I have to move my whole body in order to do these exercises.  But what about for example a crunch, where more than half of my body just lays on a bench and I only move my upper body a little? How would that be tracked? "
1973,Exercising Twice a Day,"I believe it's ok, but wanted to cross reference. Is it ok to exercise twice a day, 12 hours apart if say, you know next day you will not have chance to exercise?  In this case I'd do low-impact cardio (like jogging instead of jumping jacks and ghost jump ropes), and I'd work a different muscle group.  Any insights, past experiences? "
1974,At what point do the health benefits of strength training peak?,"The health benefits of strength training (as with most forms of regular exercise) are frequently quoted as providing increased lifespan, better ageing, disease resistance etc. However, it is certainly not the case that elite athletes live the longest, and many seem to do harm to their overall health by pushing themselves as hard as they do. Logically there must be a point at which an individual is maximising the health benefits of their training, beyond which they no longer improve their overall health and may eventually start to damage it if they push significantly harder.   To put this specifically into the context of strength training, is there a good understanding of the level of strength, or the rate of gain, at which an individual can say they're doing as much as can benefit their health? Would this be a fixed level of strength which just has to be maintained, or a constant rate of gain which represents the optimal level of stress on the body? What is known about this at the moment?  "
1975,"What is the most effective increased ""dosage"" or level of the Tabata HIIT protocol?","I've had good results following the standard Tabata Protocol (20s ""max"" and 10s rest).  Update: I do this protocol 5 days a week and mt bike pretty hard the 6th day. In the ""work"" cycle on the Tabata protocol I can reach ""max"" in about 15s.  But I got to the point where it takes me 15s or so to reach max This is on an exercise bike ""out of the saddle"".  I could probably go a little harder by ""running"" rather than ""jumping"" onto each pedal but I find that tough to coordinate on a bike.  (I am not meaning to humblebrag here: I'm the slowest person on my weekly group Mt. Bike rides. I cardio is my limitation).  I'm currently on 25s /12s rest  x 12 Reps. But.... I'm not completely wiped at the end (super tired for sure). And on each work rep I don't reach the ""poop my pants"" point .  And I think I should be. On my mt. bike rides I find that I can now go ""all out"" for longer (maybe 1-2 minutes before reaching that ""poop point"", up from about 30 s or so).  But  the guys I'm riding with can just keep at that speed for 10 minutes. (I just want to keep up so I'm not slowing everyone down :)  What is the best way to increase it?   Increase the work length? Decrease the rest? Increase the # of Reps?   And let me know whether you've measured positive results for yourself or if there is some citation of someone else who has measured it.  The Gibala Regimen and others I've seen which are designed to be less intensive increase the Work and rest cycle  and reps to:   60 w/ 75 r x 8-12 Reps. So maybe that's my answer.  "
1976,Is it possible for an Ectomorphic to build bulky muscle like the Professional body builders ?,Is it possible for an Ectomorphic to build bulky muscle like the Professional  body builders ?   Will they be able to build body and compete in body building competitions?  Should an ectomorph approach weight-lifting in a different way than someone with a different body type? 
1977,Toenail partially kicked off and lifted up... what now? How do you clean lifted up toenail?,"About an hour ago, I was working out barefoot (yeah, I know... really, really bad idea), accidentally kicked the bench's base, and ended up with a big toenail that was still attached, but separated from the toe at roughly a 45 degree angle.   After getting over the shock, horror, and somehow managing to neither pass out nor vomit (both of which felt like appealing options at the time), I made it to the bathroom. Eventually, I squirted some Neosporin onto the nail bed, gently pushed it down so that it's ""only"" separated at about a 5-10 degree angle (any more, and it started to hurt), and put a loose band-aid over it to kind of hold it down. 10 minutes later, I ended up wrapping the whole foot loosely in gauze, mainly to protect the carpet from blood that was seeping out around the edges when I walked.  So, now, here I am at the computer, about an hour later (I did other searching first), asking, ""WTF do I do now""? So far, it hasn't really started to hurt, but I'm also just sitting here and putting no stress on it whatsoever. Earlier, when I was limping up and down the stairs, it was aching a bit. Obviously, I can't spend the next N months sitting motionless at my computer desk, and sooner or later I'm going to have to deal with getting that foot into a shoe (I doubt whether anyone will complain if I limp into Walgreens or CVS with a gauze-wrapped shoeless foot, but at the very least I'm going to have to have some kind of footwear when I go to work on Monday).  I've identified the following specific immediate issues that need to be dealt with:   How hard should I try to keep the toenail flat against the nail bed, as opposed to allowing it to creep up and away from it? The problem I see is that the more firmly I hold it down, the more stress it's going to put on the area it grows from as I walk and the skin to which the nail is taped squishes, stretches, and generally moves around. On the other hand, it seems like once I'm finally back to wearing a normal shoe on that foot again, taping it firmly in place is probably a lesser evil than allowing it to constantly get pushed around by the shoe itself. I'm definitely open to suggestions for specific products to purchase this afternoon and things to do that will make the next few days and weeks more tolerable. Right now, I'm still kind of in shock &amp; afraid to do much besides sit motionless... at least, until I have some concrete plan for what to do next.   By the way, unless it's a matter of life, limb, or death, going to the hospital isn't an option. I have health insurance, but I really don't want to get hit with $1,000+ in copays and deductibles just so they can tape it down and tell me there's nothing else they can do. "
1978,What's a good exercise regime for when traveling/vacationing/etc.?,"TL;DR  I'm looking for some input for those of who have an active lifestyle, watch what you eat, try to stay in shape, but also aim to enjoy your time on vacation, as well.  About Me  I'm a 30 year old male in decent shape (6', 177 lbs). I enjoy running (and have been at it for years - 5ks, 10k, and half-marathons - and continue to run at least three days a week), and the usual home workout programs (like P90X, Insanity, etc.). I've been active with all of the above for the last seven years or so and all's worked well.  I'm married, father of two, am a software developer by day (so I have a relatively sedentary day job), and I know that I can obviously continue exercises like running, push-ups, an so on when I'm out, but I don't have the equipment let alone time to do the usual programs like I do when I'm at home.  My Main Question(s)  As I've said, I've had a lot of success with all of the above, but questions that I've often had are:   What are some of the best things to do whenever I'm on vacation? What's a good amount of time to allot for said workouts (or should I focus on keeping my heart rate elevated for a period of time)? Should I worry too much about skipping days, etc.? Any other general tips you guys and girls have?   Though I'm not necessarily concerned with losing a lot of progress over, say, the course of a week, I am looking for some suggestions for a regime of sorts of some of the best things that I can do whenever I'm traveling, on vacations, etc., to keep up with the progress I make at home.   I just don't want to be set back that much and the older I get, the easier it seems to become :).  There are a lot of apps available like (like Freeletics) though I've never tried them whenever I'm traveling, but I'm open to things like that, as well so suggestions welcome! "
1979,Is combined strength and cardio training bad?,"TL;DR: Is combining weights and cardio within the same exercise unwise or unproductive?  This video talks about cardio during weight training and describes how combining the two in a certain way can help the goal of maximising fat loss, specifically:     PHA incorporates an element of cardio into your weight training   routines by forcing your heart to work harder.   This video, however, talks about HIIT and Tabata (albeit briefly) and criticises the use of strength training combined with cardio, specifically:     Be singularly focused; If you're trying to train for strength - train   for strength; If you're trying to train for cardiovascular ... then do   that, but don't try to combine the two because it becomes just stupid   in the long run.   I am not sure if the second video is saying that the advice in the first video is actually wrong or if it is simply saying ""do that type of training properly or don't bother.""  I am not referring to this or this because I am asking if the two types of training should be used within a single exercise set at the same time at all, rather than on different days or for particular timings within a gym session.

1980,Do I need to switch up my squat stance?,I was wondering if it is actually necessary to squat in different stance.  For example you have :-  Platz Squat--> Where you squat with your feets close together  Wide Stance Squat --> Where your feets are far apart  So is there really a need to do any other variation of squat stance? Will it greatly affect my squat such as making me stronger? 
1981,"Am I training too infrequently with this compound-only plan, and should I add anything more?","I was running Reddit Bodyweight Fitness' recommended routine for awhile, but I want to do more of a split so I can focus more on individual exercises and not feel as rushed. Currently I am thinking of doing:  Pull:   Weighted pullups 5x5 Weighted inverted rows 4x8 Trap bar deadlift 3x5 Leg raises 3x15   Push:   Weighted pushups 5x5 Weighted dips 5x5 Military press 3x8 Barbell squats 5x5   I would like to build a lean but muscular and athletic physique. How might you tweak this plan? I am training 3x per week, every other day - should I train more frequently? Should I add/remove any exercises? Also, should I be alternating between pullups and chinups? "
1982,Knee Articular Cartilage pain,"Please refer image for the cartilage I am talking about. On the outer side of my left leg I experience pain after running very long distance (marathon). My doctor said that this pain is common for endurance athletes. A year back I got this pain after I finished my first half marathon. After some good running practice, I didn't get this pain at all for half marathons. But then I am getting this pain for full marathons now.    Is there any specific strengthening exercise that will address this issue? I think there will be many of you having or had the same issue, so can anyone -who overcame this- help me? Or will I just get used to this?  "
1983,Dumb Bell Routine to Build Muscle,"Hi I'm looking for an exercise routine I can implement with the equipment I have:   Adjustable Dumb Bells 5-45 lbs. (non-adjustable) Workout bench.   I'm also open to Calisthenics and cardio.  My goals are to build muscle and generally achieve what is called a ""swimmer's body"" (no access to a swimming pool :( ).  I can dedicate 45 minutes per day to this outside of the 3-4 times a week I play tennis (getting fair cardio).  Can someone with knowledge about this recommend a weekly routine to follow?  I found this Men's Health article 15 Minutes to a Swimmer's Body. Would that provide any real results or would I have to do more exercises? Never really tried to build muscle before so I'm not sure what routine is necessary to achieve results. "
1984,Nutritional supplements for the brain,"There are a million things to eat/drink when working out.  When I go for a long bike ride, I've found that Gatorade and occasionally those shot bloks keep me fueled very well.  Are there similar products for getting a boost of energy and mental focus while not being physically active?  I work in an office all day, and on occasion end up working 12-15 hours a day for a week or so.  This gets mentally exhausting after a couple days.  Is it advisable to use the same supplements while not doing physical activity? "
1985,Daily weight variance - as high as 2 or 3 percent?,"Of course, your weight varies throughout the day. Your weight is different morning/evening, before/after eating, and so on. Naturally if you are tracking your weight, you should measure your weight at exactly the same time each day.  However, out of curiosity, I have found variations as high as 2 or even more kilograms.  (Call it 2% to 3%.)  Does anyone have any specific information on the normal or usual weight variation through the 24 hours of day? Is ""two or three kilograms"" just wildly too much?  I realise that ""extreme weight managers"" such as boxers, bodybuilders and so on can deliberately vary their weight by huge amounts in a day or less.  However what I am asking about here is the normal variation for a typical person, eating and drinking normally, perhaps doing an hour of aerobic exercise a day.  Anyway - in normal life is a weight variation as high as 2-3 kg per day, unusual?  What's the norm? "
1986,"Continuous everyday workout and sudden drop in stamina, does it indicate a caloric deficiency?","Good day folks,  I have been continuously working out (30-45 Minutes) everyday for the last 3 weeks and noticed a sudden drop in stamina for the last 3 days, i haven't changed my diet significantly.  I checked my blood pressure last night and noticed it to be 10 points lower than normal on both scales.  Fitbit heart rate readings indicate that i am not hitting the cardio zone as much in the last 3 days and yesterday was the worst.   Feel tired than usual when working out.  Had a dizzy spell after working out yesterday (Heart rate shows that i didn't hit the cardio zone at all)   are these signs of caloric deficiency or am i over excreting? or something else?    (I don't count calories) "
1987,ISOLATION & UNILATERAL + COMPOUND & BILATERAL CORRELATION,"Recently I came across many training variants, methods &amp; styles and since I'm trying to build a lets say ""tree of life"" but for fitness categories &amp; their subdivisions.  I want to know if Isolation exercises are the same as Unilateral and Compound the same to Bilateral? or can both Isolation &amp; compound include Uni and Bi lateral exercises?  So can there be ""Isolation Unilateral"" and ""Isolation Bilateral""?  I am aware of Unilateral being one SIDE of the body and not one specific PART of the body, so having that in mind I guess Isolation which is one PART of the body lets say the bicep, can include working out just one bicep ""Isolation Unilateral"" and both biceps without working a sinergist or ""Helping Muscle"" as compunds do...  Also having the previous in mind, it seems BOTH Isolation &amp; Compound can have bilaterals but can Compound have Unilateral?  Im confused.  "
1988,Tips to improve frailty and an easily injured body?,"I've attempted to start an exercise regimen several times in the last 10 years and I've never been able to stick with it.  I'm starting again and after just two sessions I developed an injury that is keeping me out of the gym for a week: I sprained my ankle either doing ankle rotations to loosen it up or when using an exercise strap to do hamstring stretches. On a previous attempt to get a regimen going, I had a dumbbell fall on my chest when doing a chest press and subluxated a rib. Just yesterday I was breaking down boxes for recycling and ended up straining a ligament in my back when pushing or pulling cardboard into the recycling bin.  I'm a skinny guy that lives a sedentary computer geek lifestyle. My body has been very unused for a very long time. Probably every ligament and muscle in my body is weak and prone to injury at this point.  I'm looking for some tips for exercises that can help develop and condition my entire body to be more resilient against these kinds of issues. I don't want to let this injury take the wind out of my nascent exercise sails but if I keep getting injured it's going to be very disheartening and counterproductive. Maybe I should be frontloading some specific exercise that strengthens the entire body at once?  Running? Swimming? Yoga? Some kind of massage? These were the things that jumped to my mind but I'm not sure how to know whether they're what I'm looking for. I'm open to pretty much anything.  Thanks in advance! "
1989,cant do push-ups,"I am 1.83m (6 feet) tall and my weight is 100kg.   I started running from last month and now I can run 2 miles with a 10 Min walking gap in between. One week ago I joined a gym. The problem is that on the first day I was asked to do push-ups 10 reps 3 set. I did it. On the second day I tried to do that again but felt as I had torn my tissues and was in excruciating pain. Then on the next day again  I tried to do push ups and couldn’t do even one. It is the sixth day today (with a one day gap in between ) and I still cant do even a single push-up.   I am ashamed of me now, embarrassed, what is wrong ? it feels as if its all locked. I just cant do push-up. everything else is happening. I don’t have any more pain in my body but still no push-ups, I am now reluctant to go to gym as I feel bad about myself. what to do ? "
1990,Rotator Cuff Muscles Categorization,"Is the rotator cuff considered part of the shoulder or back?  I heard on an Athlean X video I'll link below this one is a branch of the back muscles above and below the spine of the scapula, however it seems to me it is more of a shoulder based along with the deltoid.   ([website]Also which exercises would target these set of muscles.   "
1991,Why can't I lose weight?,"I'm a 23 year old woman, 5'8"", and 164 lbs. I'm having difficulty losing weight. Am I getting too much protein? Or am I not eating enough?  I start my day with a Clif bar (260 cal, 9g protein), have a snack, trail mix (190 cal, 4g protein), protein bar for lunch (270 cal, 20g protein), then for dinner I usually have a salad, boneless/skinless chicken breast, or something small with few calories. I usually throw an apple or a banana somewhere in my day. What am I doing wrong? "
1992,"is it important to keep both shoulders at equal strength? (If so, why?)","My wife got a hairline fracture in the ball of her shoulder joint about two years ago. Unfortunately, it still hurts when she exercises that shoulder, which limits how much she can train it.   If she exercises each shoulder as much as she wants to, naturally the non-problematic shoulder will progress in strength faster, increasing the already-present strength disparity between the two.  The question is: is there anything wrong with that?   In other words, should she train each shoulder as much as she is able? Or is there something dangerous in increasing lateral strength disparity?  The single-arm exercises she does are mostly kettlebell lifts and swings. "
1993,"Best strategy for running twice 5km in timespan 2,5 hours","I am participating in a 5km-runing relay event organized by my employer. One of my colleagues dropped out, and couldnt find replacement. Now I offered to run also his 5k.  Running 10k is no problem for me, since I have done that already a couple of times (just below 45 minutes). Normally, in a race you are running the 10k in one go, but due to the nature of the relay race, a colleague suggested that I could take a break of about an hour in between(in which my other teammates run their 5km).  I am in doubt whether taking a break in between is a good idea. On the one hand you can get some rest and refuel for the second 5km, but on the other hand your body will switch to recovery mode during the break.   I am just wondering if there are any studies or experiences that could inform me on this decision? Or any tips for how I should use the break in between? "
1994,Daily stretch routine to increase flexibilty and overall fitness?,"Is there a standard (as much as can be standard) stretch routine that if used regularly over a period of time will increase/maintain flexibility and help my overall fitness level?  I have a set of stretches I've been doing since playing basketball in high school, and I guess I'm wanting either to validate the routine or to find a standard routine that encompasses all the muscles you want to stretch on a daily basis.  I'm thinking a routine from a branch of the military or something like that.  Does this exist, or is it another one of those areas that is too personalized to have a general rule? "
1995,How can I get toned without losing weight?,"I am a 17 year old female about 5'6"" to 5'7"" and weigh about 120/125 lbs, and am skinny so I don't want to lose any weight. I am active in sports, but I am not where I want to be and would like to be more successful. So how do I get get toned without losing weight? Where do I start? "
1996,Uncategorized BACK muscles,"Very often I hear the terms ""middle back"" as well as ""lower back"" aside from the traditional ""Lats"" and ""Traps"" which are defined by their actual name and not something like ""side back training"" for example.    If I want to train the ""Rhomboids"" and ""Teres major"" which one would be the synonym for which...is Rhomboids the ""middle back"" and Teres Major the ""lower back"" or is it the other way around? Also the ""Erector Spinae""...is this a synonym or part of one of the previous muscles? And where would it fit..Middle or low back?  Thanks. "
1997,Sport that is less stressful to knees?,"I have bad knees and wish to do more exercise to lose weight. Running and jogging is bad. Do you have other recommendation? I don't have a bike and my home just have no place for a bike. And I can't swim.  In addition, I've heard other said squating is good for knees, but I wonder if I can do it with 2 dumbbells? Because I don't want to go gym room which require monthly fee. I have a pair of weight-configurable dumbbells so I am wondering if I can do it in free weight mode.  "
1998,"How can a scale measure body fat and water percentages, muscle and bone mass, BMI, BMR and AMR (calories burned)?","The Runtastic Libra scale can measure body fat and water percentages, muscle and bone mass, BMI, BMR and AMR (calories burned). That's a lot of measurements done through the skin of the feet from standing?  What's the scientific workings behind these measurements and would the readings be accurate enough for tracking purposes after a few weeks of workouts and physical exercises? I am thinking of getting one. "
1999,Can external rotations help an already torn rotator cuff?,"I just got a new client who informed that both of his rotater cuffs are torn. From My understanding, it seems as though I should avoid all upper body exercises so that I don't injure them further.   I also know that external rotations are used for prehab to strengthen the shoulders before they get hurt, but can this exercise be used once the damage has been done? Can I help this client gain some strength in his shoulders using external rotaions?  "
2000,Workout Suggestions for a 260lbs person that wont cause serious injury on the joints,"I am 6""1 and around 264.5lbs (or around about 120kg). I really love working out and i have been losing some weight, but i can't do cardiovascular training or most body-weight type training due to the strain my weight puts on my joints.   Usually the joint pain isn't so severe but i have had a couple of times where i had to skip a few days workout because i can barely move around, as i do not want to aggravate the injury further.  My diet is good, and i make sure to do at least an hour of physical activity per day. The only problem is the joint strain.   Does anyone have any ideas or workouts that would be able to kind of ""work around"" joint problems, or will i have to just cut down the intensity of the training??  Also, is maybe weight training a better solution??  Thanks :) "
2001,Metabolic Equations for Anaerobic Exercise?,"I know several metabolic equations for estimating VO2 (and therefore calories burned) for steady state exercise, but how is VO2 and caloric expenditure estimated through exercises like power lifting and explosive exercise, like burpees?  This being said, what are the METs (metabolic equivalents) for such exercises?  All METs I have seen are for physical activity, not for specific exercises.  I would like to know the caloric value of different exercises to estimate whether or not one is over-training.  My current formal education is heavily focused on health vs performance. "
2002,Pilates mat vs reformer ? which is better?,"I have a sway in my back. I am new to Pilates and it seems to correct the backache and sway in the back tremendously.   But Pilates mat(at home) makes me feel stronger and posture corrects afterwards. Pilates reformer hurts my back.  I get a lot of recommendations for Reformer, as a beginner.  How come same Pilates technique does not work on Reformer ? Am I doing something wrong while on Reformer? Are there any common mistakes to avoid while working with reformer ?  Any advice for me ? "
2003,"Trying to gain weight in a healthy way, but getting a bigger or bloated belly as a result!","I started a month ago at about 62Kg and i'm now 64.3Kg. I'm also 1m74 and I'm 22 Years old.  As stated in the title, I'm trying to gain weight in a healthy way, but I'm actually also getting a bigger or bloated belly (not sure which) as a result! Is this normal? What to do?  I'm going to the gym 3 times a week (full body), skipping cardio (I want to GAIN weight) and going for full muscle building excercises, always pushing myself to the max. Before my makout I also drink protein shakes, and after I eat a protein bar. I'm also making sure I drink enough water during the day.  I'm watching my diet and making sure I don't eat to much fat or sweat things, no more candy, sweet drinks or fat foods. I'm trying to eat more and this also divided in more eating times (I try to maintain 4-5 eat periods a day).  "
2004,Train Calfs and Abs weight- or repetition-based?,"I'm doing one-legged standing calf raises and crunches in my workout routine. A lot of people talk about training these two muscle groups (calfs and abs) specifically based on repetition, therefor with no weights. However, there are atleast equal the amount of people telling the oposite and using extra weights and doing less reps.  So for example on a bench press, I obviously put on the weights I can handle and do, like in my case, 10 reps. But for calfs and abs I'm pretty confused now.  Is it better to take some extra weights for these exercises and only do about 10 reps too? Or should one take no weights, only the weight of the body itself so to say, and do as many reps as you can? "
2005,What should I be doing to improve the quality of my interval training?,"Currently I'm running 12 400m repeats on a track, with 3 minutes for each repeat: so roughly a minute and a half of recovery between each lap.  What constitutes 'good' quality for these intervals?  eg should I be aiming to hit exactly the same lap time throughout the session, or would that mean that I was going out too easy for the first few?  should I be doing less repeats?  Increasing the recovery time between them?  (Currently I'm doing the first 4 in about 1:22, the next four at about 1:30, and the remainder fluctuating between 1:25 and 1:35) "
2006,"How to find someone that can direct my training to a safe path, what is the name of such profession and where should I look?","In my country of origin it is very difficult to find a good coach to supervise your training. Specially useless are those guys you find as gym staff with ""ask me"" written in the t-shirt, because they are usually not knowledgeable at all, they are simply people who got muscular. The next step in complexity and knowledge you mostly find are medical doctors who have no idea of sports and will put you immediately to walk or at most swim if you are over 35.  I moved recently to the States and I guess things are different here. I want to find a coach who is able to direct and supervise my strength training so that I get health benefits and avoid injuries, because I have tried hard alone for long time and I constantly find myself in a dangerous position, always risking injury (or actually injuring myself badly).  What is the name of such profession? Where should I start my search? What should I specially look for in such person and what should I avoid? "
2007,Knee pain after jogging on an inclined pavement,"I haven't been exercising for a while, and three days ago I decided I'd go jogging outdoors. I am currently in Germany, and like most of the pavements in Germany, they are inclined towards the road to direct rain water.   I was jogging around a block in a counter-clockwise direction. After two days of running (45 minutes each I guess), I started to feel a pain in my left knee. I can tell that it is not just a muscle ache, and it is only in my left knee, which apparently was pressing against a higher ground of the pavement than my right one. It hurts when I extend my left leg while walking.  Should I worry about this? I thought next time I'd do it clockwise instead, is this a good idea? "
2008,Cramping in chest after working out,"Sometimes 1/2 day to a day after a tough workout, when I lean forward, I get a severe cramping in my chest...it feels like a bad muscle cramp in my ribs (just above the sternum on the right hand side).  What is my body trying to tell  me? and how can I stretch to stop this from happening? "
2009,What is the key to avoid injury when squatting with your body weight?,"After seeing the suggestions about sport/exercise which are less stressful, or even good for my knees, I chose squatting. From the suggestions, it can be done with minimal space and equipment at my home, which is also a plus. Especially I would try squatting with my own body weight so as not to give extra pressure on the knees. (Anyway I don't have a barbell.)  But Ryan Miller stated that ""If you decide to try squats, just make sure your knees do not go more forward than your toes at the bottom of the squat.""  I tried to mimic the squatting from some videos, but as I went down, I can only keep the knees right above the toes, is it okay? The knees tend to go forwards, but I can keep them back by focusing and downward movement in my butt.  Are there any key point to avoid injury, and facilitate squatting? "
2010,40/40/20 Ratio and 1.5g of protein per pound still a good rule of thumb?,"Back in the day, the bodybuilder's diet (for growth) was the infamous 40/40/20.  That is, 40% of calories from Protein, 40% of calories from Carbs, and 20% of calories from Fat.  If we look at the rule of thumb: 1.5g per lb (weight), we can work backwards.     Let's say my weight is 210 pounds:  Calculate Protein:  Knowing that 1 gm of protein is 4 kcals          Calculate Daily Total kcals:  (Protein represents 40% of our diet)      Calculate Carbs:  Since carbs are the same percentage and same kcal per gram (energy) as protein, it's easy to calculate them.      Calculate Fat:  (total kcals - (Protein + Carbs)) = Fat     or          Finally:  Which leaves us with 315 grams of protein, 315 grams of carbs, 70 grams of fat per day.  With all of that said... 3150 appears to be a high number to me.  Am I missing something? "
2011,Cause of hunger: thinking or enjoyment?,"No duplicate! I have read here.   Reading newspaper or even preparation for IELTS test, walking fast, with-no-stop working in supermarket all makes me feel hungry as a sign of losing calories, but when I study mathematics especially with enjoyment I feel much more need for food for recovery!  Is it because of enjoyment (sad or at least normal non-excited people don't like too much eating) or it is because math is harder?   The other problem is that I gain a lot of weight when I eat a lot due to feeling hungry while studying math. So I also think the sign of hunger and lack-of-energy (and really feeling headache like similar to starving) doesn't come from losing calories. (?)  How can I avoid such feelings while still studying well and not gaining a lot weight?  Thanks a lot.     "
2012,Why is it important to recuperate between workouts?,"After intensive workouts muscle soreness is a common phenomenon. I heard, that it is important to recuperate before working out again. However, I had the following experience: During a two week bike trip I continued the trip despite the soreness and lost a lot of weight and gained endurance. I am wondering now, if I should continue with what I know will work (working out despite the soreness) or if I should wait until the muscles recuperated. Are there any references or articles that reflect this topic? Why is it important to wait until the muscles are not sore anymore? "
2013,Off a bulk and now cutting,"So I just finished a bulk phase and I'm entering a cutting program. I've been losing weight so far, but my question is does it really matter if I don't reach my calorie deficit target? It's at 2700 calories, but I only reach about 2000 calories.   My protein intake is very high at about 210 grams, but my carbs is lower than what those calculators tell me I should be eating. Does it really matter to reach that carb amount? I mean I understand I need energy but I dont have any energy problems in the gym. As a matter of fact I've been increasing weight. New lifter gains but still, I'm really confused.   Those calculators give me such a high protein and carb level that I have to make. As long as I keep my protein and fat right its ok? I dont have to follow carbs that much? "
2014,How many estimated percentage of my weight that I lift while doing elevated push ups,"Question No. 1:  How many estimated percentage of my weight that I lift while doing elevated push ups with my feet on my unstable bed about 60cm from the floor (so I also keep my balance work here) ?  I can do it 10 reps, after I usually do 60 - 100 reps classic push ups and 10 deep push ups.  My weight is 76kg. It can vary from 73 - 76kg, I'll continue my ""strict"" diet lifestyle again in September 2011.   Related Weight thread for Classic Push ups  This is the pic I stole from baseops, I believe for my case, my feet is 15-20cm higher than that.    Question No. 2:  I can only do 2 reps of not perfect hand stand push ups so far, I'm not 180 degree upside down, maybe about 20 - 30 degree to be completely upside down. Is it true that I lift my total body weight (76kg) while doing it ?  I really feel something GOOD on my shoulders' muscle for both of these kinds of push ups. Specially for hand stand push ups, about 2 - 5 minutes after that workout, I kinda feel refresher. I wonder if that happened because my blood flowing to my head? "
2015,Should skinny guys go to gym for getting better body?,"Heyy!  I am 16, 5'7"" and skinny. I have been trying a lot to gain some body like a normal person then I can go to gym and start building muscle. Now I am thinking to go to gym to build muscle as well as gain weight. I am confused on something, some people says that if I go to gym and start building muscle then I won't get more height, will stay same height, I cannot gain weight and more blah blah blah. Also, some people says ""eat big and get big also eat quality not quantity"" but I have trying this stuff since long time ago but no result yet :/ :(  Now I'd like to know it clearly from big dude or hard-gainer :p that, does gym impact on height and can I gain weight by gym? also know me, should I go to gym? also hoping for some recommendation from big-dude/hard-gainer :)  Cheers!

2016,Dangerous to use barbell squat without padding?,Are you supposed to use foam padding on the bar when doing barbell squats? The answer seems inconsistent even from the same professional bodybuilder. I've seen Arnold Schwarzenegger sometimes go bare and at other times use as much padding as a small yoga mat. How can several hundred pounds of pressure on the trapezius be safe and comfortable? I've always found bare barbells unpleasant on the trapezius. Is doing it bare supposed to be beneficial somehow?  Padded    Bare   
2017,Is this a good at-home exercise routine for a beginner?,"I was recently handed this book on stretching exercises by my friend. It has a set of exercises that one is supposed to do daily; starting with 7 repetitions and gradually increasing to 9, 11 and so on till one can do 25 reps.    The exercise routine begins with a warm up consisting of:  Simple skipping for 3 minutes   Spot jogging for 3 minutes   20 - 25 jumping jacks   Once done with this, there are the below mentioned exercises:  Two-arm stretch: Raise both arms above your head. Breathe in, stretch as high as you can. Hold for 5 counts. Slacken as you breathe out.   One-arm stretch: Raise one arm above the head. Breathe in. Hold for count of 5. Slacken as you breathe out.   Toe-touching: Feet together. Bend down and touch your toes. Repeat 20 - 25 times.  The Pelvic Tilt: This image shows it better   Upward hand clasp: Both the feet one foot apart. Hands raised above the head, clasp the fingers together. Bend to the left, straighten, bend to the right. breathe in when bending.   Shoulder Shrugs: This image shows it better   Lying down hamstring stretch: Lie down flat, hands off to the side. Raise legs to 90 degree with body. Stretch along the thighs as much as you can. Kinda like splits.    Heel Raise: This image shows it better but I have to do one heel at a time.   Strap assisted stretch: Hang from some hooks for 3 minutes, increasing as you go on.     So I have the following few questions: 1. Is the Pelvic Tilt 'safe' ? How does it affect the spine ? 2. The same with the Heel Raise. The book says that it changes the arch of the foot. Both these exercises make me concerned because they actually 'change' the structure of the body and I am a first-timer exercising so I do not wanna do anything stupid. 3.  I do not get to do the last exercise as I do not have hooks to suspend myself from. Will it have a detrimental effect ?    I am 19, male. "
2018,Fitness measurement based on pace and average heart rate,"I would like an approach to use the data heart rate + pace from a run to give me a factor that will help me see my improvements on different runs. For example, if I have run at a pace of 5:30 with an average heart rate of 160, I think it is better than if I have run at a pace of 5:14 with an average heart rate of 185. And a pace of 5:14 with a heart rate of 160 would be the best of the three.  Is there any formyla or do you have any suggestion on how to assess this? Something more elaborate than 1/(pace+(heart rate*2))? "

REST  30' running  upper body, abs, neck  30' running legs 30' running REST   I'm doing very few reps (10 at most) on strength training days.  Although I'm seeing progress, I would like to have some advices if is there any way to improve it. Some issues that comes to my mind that I would love to see addressed:   Am I punishing to much my knees when I run, have a strength training day, then run again? If I have a day with higher reps for upper body, would it improve my endurance without interfere on strength gains? Any issues training fasted, first thing in the morning? That's how I'm doing and feels great.   Thank you very much in advance. "
2020,Leg pain after exercises,"I have been exercising at home for the past 4-5 months. 3 times a week. My legs exercise routine is 60 bridges and 12x5 leg raises. The  day before yesterday i did exactly the same routine , and i felt the normal ''pain'' i always feel.I didn't do any exercises yesterday because i was still hurting a little bit. But this morning when i woke up, my right leg, felt like it had been removed . I can't lay on my bed , i can't sit, i can't walk i cannot do anything because it hurts so bad. This is the 1st time ever i feel this kind of pain. The parts that hurt are, one inch below my booty to my knee. What should I do? I need immediate answers . Should i see a doctor? I have been putting some relaxing cremes on my leg but they haven't worked out AT ALL. I haven't massaged because it hurts even if I touch it. I'm literally suffering and i do not know what to do. Please reply as soon as possible , because i need some more information about what could be possibly going on with my leg before i visit a doctor. I am looking forward , Donna "
2021,Run even if it pains? - chrondomalacia patellae,"I am stuck with a knee injury since August 2013, with not much a progress then. PT's haven't been of much help. Ortho diagnosed I have chrondomalacia pattelae. I also think i have some pelvic misalignment and strength imbalances in posterior and anterior chain muscles. I have come across two PT's now who are pretty experienced - they treat competitive athletes on a regular basis. Both of them have asked me to jog for a few days even if it hurts and that body has its own way of healing.  In my knowledge, one shouldn't exercise on the top of pain, especially when its a joint pain. And again high impact exercises when one already has leg length difference (due to pelvic misalignment?). To me, it doesn't make sense at all. Looking at their experience, I am wondering am I missing something. Are there injuries there where one has to do exercises that cause pain in the site of injury and then they really heal?  I'm afraid my question is a bit vague.  "
2022,What are the best methods to prevent and treat foot blisters?,"I play a lot of 5-a-side football/soccer on concrete, although I used to get the same issues when playing on wooden court as well. I've tried plastering my feet in bandaids, double layer socks, and currently I'm playing with real thick nike football socks, none seem to make much difference.  The smaller the court, the larger the chance and damage of getting blisters, I assume simply because on a small court, the ball and run of play tends to switch a lot more, requiring constant change of direction.  I don't seem to get many blisters on larger astro turf or grass.  I've read that getting the ""right"" shoes is a big deal, however I really don't understand the criteria to apply to find the right shoes? Should a shoe be a little loose during play, or should it be a perfectly tight fit? Are there any inserts or soles that might help?  In addition, what is the best method to deal with healing blisters? My wife seems to think I should be covering them in bandaids, where as my mind is telling me that leaving covering off for a while so that it can harden quicker is the better path to recovery.  Thanks! "

2025,How often should I do Calisthenic workouts?,"I'm doing calisthenic workout for a year. So I'm not beginner. But I'm confused about the frequency of the routines. My workout program is like this:  Monday:   Lower Body Tuesday:  Upper Body Wednesday:Abs/Core Thursday: Lower Body Friday:   Upper Body Saturday: Abs/Core Sunday:   Rest   Every workout is about 30 mins, and my muscles are hurting for 2 days. (Abs/Core training is 15mins, but I'm going to change it) Is it a good split program? Or shall I do everything in one day and rest other day?   (Sorry for my bad English) "
2026,"What is the purpose of ""light"" days in a lifting routine","Several well known routines Texas Method, Madcows, All Pros contain ""light"" or ""medium"" days. If the goal of these days is to rest and recovery, wouldn't someone be better off doing no exercises?  Do these sessions still build muscle when your exercising at 90% or 80% of your ""heavy"" days? Or are they just to practice form?  "
2027,One rep max formula - why do I get tired during warm-up,"I'm doing a reverse on the one rep max formula. That is, if my one rep max in a certain exercise is 30 kg, then following the 1RM = m(30 + r)/30 formula, you get r = 30(RM - m)/m .  But this would also imply that in that case the maximum number of repeats with 4 kg should be 195 while with 2 kg it should be 420 reps. However, a warm-up with 28 reps with 2 kgs followed by 26 reps of 4 kgs renders me already tired. I can push the 30 kgs once, but I see no chance to ever do 195 reps with 4 kgs (let alone 420 with 2 kgs) after that.  What am I doing wrong? Where do my calculations go wrong? How can these numbers be improved? "
2028,What's the minimum amount of strength training that will yield a measurable benefit?,"I'm not an athlete &ndash; I just want to be healthy and fit with decent muscular strength.  What's the minimum amount of strength training that will yield a measurable benefit?  For instance, sitting down once a month on one fitness machine for 5 minutes won't likely yield a benefit ... I'm assuming!  On the other hand, training a couple of hours each day with multiple sets, repetitions, etc. on most of the different machines available probably would yield a benefit.  Optimizing for time, what would be a reasonable minimum in terms of number of times per week, # sets &amp; reps, variety of machines, etc. where strength training will still yield a positive benefit, in terms of building balanced body muscle, and not just maintaining what (little) muscle I've got?  What findings support the design of a strength training schedule &amp; frequency? "
2029,Toe nails damaged after marathon,"I find that my friend recently had a toe nail peeled off and the other leg's big toe nail is also about to peel off.

What are the precautionary steps that can be taken? "
2030,Is the optimal cadence for racing the same as for conditioning?,"I read that 180 steps per minute is the ""optimal"" running cadence, but all running research seems geared towards racers.  If I run purely for fitness, and don't care about my speed, should I target a longer stride (and, presumably, slower cadence)?  I assume that racers don't care if they are conditioning their muscles to a restricted range of motion if that gives them a more physiologically efficient stride, whereas for general fitness don't we prefer to maximize the range of motion covered during exercise?

2031,How long do I wait after a failed lift?,"I just failed a 455lb dead lift, tried to down scale to a 405lb which I've been able to pull 5 of previously and failed at that too.  How long do I rest prior to reattempting a previous max (405lb at 5 reps) and then reattempt the 455 level lift? Is it a week? or more? or less? "
2032,Pulled a muscle - How to heal and relieve pain,"I pulled a muscle in my neck and upperback. What is the best way to heal and relieve the pain?  The advice on the web is not clear. Some people say apply heat, some say cold, and some say alternate both. Also, are products like bengay efficient for relieving the pain? Are there other analgesics that can help with the pain of pulling a muscle?  To clarify, think my pain comes from having carried heavy bags for too long for too many days. It just started hurting yesterday, but I am not sure what specific movement I made.  My neck and upperback hurt whenever I move my head (up, down,left or right). "
2033,How many days in a week should I work out?,"I'm self-employed, which means I can arrange my time however I want, therefore I can hit the gym every day in a week. I also do have the energy to do so.  But, I've heard it's not a good idea. Why so? How many days in a week should I work out? How should I arrange these days? (go, go, go, go, rest, rest, go), or (go, rest, go, rest, go, rest, go) ?  EDIT: I'm talking about lifting weights in a gym in order to gain weight, strength and muscle. I'm relatively low-weight, I don't need to lose any weight. "
2034,Lower lat/ribcage pain while Deadlifting,"For the last year or so I've been taking the deadlift seriously. Every time I near my max, we'll say my 3-rep max, I feel a what can best be described as a pressure / pain on my lower rib cage. It feels like it could be deep muscle, as the pain fades quickly (1 or 2 seconds) after I set the weight down. Anyone else experience this? Anyone know the cause/how to remedy it? Thanks.  "
2035,How to train general stamina (e.g. 12 minutes running),"There are activities where I consider my fitness above average:   Long-term stamina (hiking or cycling for several hours) Going up a hill, or going up stairs   I have friends (same sex, same age as me) who have less stamina in these areas, meaning they are either slower than me, or they show more (or sooner) signs of fatigue (sweating, breathing) than me.  However, there are other activities where they have much more stamina than me:   Playing tennis Running for 5-15 minutes, trying to get as far as possible. Cycling up a hill (3 minutes) Running to catch a train   As you can see, these are mostly areas where you have to give maximal performance for a short time (&lt; 15 minutes).  These acitivities feel like pain to me. When playing tennis, I often feel the strong urge to take a break. However, I enjoy doing the long-term activities listed at the top.  What could be the reasons for this difference?  E.g. do I have smaller lungs, less hemoglobin, or maybe more stamina-instead-of-power genes?  What sorts of training methods could I do to improve my short-term stamina?  I have been doing training sets of 12 minutes on a stationary bicyle (in the gym) for over a year now. The reason I'm doing them is because I want to get better short-term stamina, and I hope that playing tennis will be more enjoyable if I have more short-term stamina. During these 12-minutes workouts, I'm trying to get as much performance as possible. My pulse rate goes to 170 BPM (now higher than 175) during such a workout.  However I don't see any improvement. I currently don't get more performance on the stationary bicycle than when I began doing these workouts, and I don't see any change in the activities listed above.  Grateful for any ideas and suggestions. "
2036,Running shoes vs barefoot: which is better for squat and dead lift?,"This answer mentions that you shouldn't do squat exercises in running shoes. Why is that?  I don't feel like performing squats and dead lifts with running shoes are creating any issues for me, but it's also less than half a year ago since I added weightlifting to my gym routine.   I don't remember ever seeing other people at the gym switch footwear between weight lift and cardio routines, but maybe I didn't pay notice.  Would kicking off the running shoes be a viable alternative, or given the choice between that and running shoes, would keeping the running shoes on be better? "
2037,Legs cramping in cold weather after leg workouts,"Why are my legs cramping in cold weather the day that I work them out?  Recently, after I workout my legs, usually pretty intense workouts that range from high intensity to low rep high weight, they will start to cramp if I am outside in cold weather. Yesterday was particularly bad after a particularly intense leg workout. I got home, stepped out of my car, the temperature was probably around 28F and my quads immediately cramped up. I had to practically crawl to my house and then sit on the floor until they warmed up. From past experience, if I stretch them out when this happens, my hamstrings will start to cramp and then it's just a vicious cycle of leg cramps. Also, I usually eat two bananas every day.  How can I prevent this from happeneing in the future?  Edit  So far, the general consensus seems to be drink more water. I should have stated in the question originally that that should not be the issue because I drink at least a gallon of water every day.  "
2038,Lower back pain relief,"I have been weight training for 18 months, and in the past few months have started to get lower back pain. I particularly feel it when I wake up in the morning. Nothing too serious or painful but I can certainly feel it.   I have started to do a number of lower back stretches, particularly first thing in the morning, which definitely relieves the pain, but doesn't eliminate it. At gym I do hyper-extensions which also help a lot.   My question is:   Should I be doing any specific weighted back exercises (deadlifts,good-mornings, weighted hyper-extensions) or will that simply increase the pain and be counter-productive?  What else could / should I be doing so that I don't increase the pain and rather find a way to alleviate it? "
2039,Difficulty Maintaining Activation of Hamstrings After PCL Tear,"You know the cringe factor that causes you to shiver or grimace when you think about fingernails on chalkboard? The flinch, the drawing back sensation-- the stability issues and gristly-cartilage noises I get in my right knee [if I haven't been working out] after my PCL tear trigger this, and my inability to 'trust' my knee, combined with 'the muscles deactivating somewhat shortly after a workout', are causing problems with me returning to full activity like 'normal walking'  The PT I went to prescribed a lot of exercises-- nearly all of which seem to be just strengthening my quads. For example, the resistance band leg exercises when I'm standing on the blue Theraband pad just seem to strengthen my quads in a manner that provides stability by making the leg a pillar, rather than strengthening the stabilizing muscles you use when reflexively maintaining balance.  My best luck so far? High intensity deadlifts/squats. However, after I've got them activated, I don't seem to be able to maintain normal use. So much as thinking about the instability causes me to flinch in fear and fall back into planting and directing my steps with my left leg. It's also really hard to do the exercises every day-- feels very machine-like and lifeless.  So I need some way to get the muscles activated, strengthened, and keep them activated.   I feel like I'm forgetting how to walk 'normally'. "
2040,Mitigate workout exhaustion,"When I had a really intensive training session (weights), the day after I'm so exhausted that I can't do anything the whole day. I can't even concentrate, so my work performance (desk job) degrades to such a level that I am thinking about avoiding those sessions during the week.  The problem is that I don't see any improvement at all in that matter. I train for about a year now and although I definitely made progress in my workout, I'm still exhausted on the following day as on day one.  As other people don't seem to suffer from this as much as I do, I wonder if I do something wrong with my after-workout nutrition.  Normally I go for high protein food, and if I did cardio, something isotonic.  Am I doing something wrong? Or do I just need to increase the amount or duration I take supplements (protein/isotonic/etc.) afterwards?  Food: I don't have a strict nutrition plan, but post-workout I mostly eat chicken, salmon, steak, vegetables + supplements (protein shake/bar, isotonic)  Exercises: Basically everything strength related (back, arms, chest, neck, legs...)

2041,What does it mean to bonk or hit the wall?,"What does it mean to bonk or hit the wall during a run or a bike ride?  That is the main question, but to generate a more detailed answer here please consider these corollary questions:  Can this can be a fairly serious thing, so what are the effects of this that makes it so serious?  Is bonking the same as hitting a wall??  Please explain what causes a bonk to occur, what things you would experience before, during, and after.   Are there benefits to bonking?  If hitting the wall is different then please elaborate on this too. "
2042,Will doing wall sits slow down my running?,"The wall sit, or Roman chair, is an exercise designed to strengthen the quadriceps. As such, it should increase muscle mass. However, how will doing such an exercise consistently affect my running? I.e. will it slow me down? "
2043,Is working out localized muscle going to help burn fat in that area more than building up overall muscle mass?,"When different people gain weight, the fat tends to accumulate in different parts of the body based on the individual. Some people gain in their stomach, their buttocks, their thighs, etc.  If I am looking to burn off localized fat in my stomach, for example, would I be any better off focusing more time on my abs? Or would I get similar benefit by working out my whole body, building up overall muscle mass?  Essentially, when burning fat, does the location of the muscle you're working have any bearing on where the fat might come off?  Yes, I realize that cardio is useful/mandatory for weight/fat loss as well. I am not interested in the cardio aspects for this question, however. "
2044,Mass doubling for a healthy man from marathon training (summer) to weight training (winter)? Normal?,"I have trained a variety of sports such as soccer, swimming, skiing -- and later in the university got interested in weight-lifting. I do 6 months' fat-burning training such as marathon etc (summer) and 6 months' mass-fat-muscle-increasing training (winter). My mass doubles during the weight-lifting session. I just do what feels good: I try to train as symmetric muscle groups as possible and not overdo any muscle. My age is 25 currently, height about 175cm. The last cycle my mass increased from 70kg to 100kg so 30/70, 43% increase in mass.  My goal is just to maintain a healthy fitness profile, I am feeling far better when decided to invest in training. Now I would like to understand its planning.     Is it normal that mass doubles 6 months for a healthy man from marathon training to weight training? Is there any suggestions for this kind of training schedule for the mass?

2045,Muscle hurts after HiiT session,"3 Days ago i did an HiiT Session with dumbbells. I did different excercises in 3 Sets with 12 Repetitions.   After I finished excercising i didn't do any streching exercises. On the next day I had aching muscles. And the following 2 days, Yesterday and Today it hurted and still hurts when I ""stretch"" my arm over an angle of 100 degrees.  Can anybody tell me what could be happened to my muscle? How can I cure it? And how can prevent it the next time? "
2046,"How do you actually, physically, lose weight?","When you exercise and/or are on a diet, how does the weight you lose physically leave your body? Is it through defecation, or do you actually burn it somehow?  "
2047,Cable pull throughs as alternatives to traditional deadlifts,"Im constantly looking for deadlift alternatives for my home workout program (or for home workouts in general, not only for me). This time I stumbled over an exercise called cable pull throughs (you can also do this with resistance bands).     With bodybuilding aims in mind, how does this exercise compare to a tradidional deadlift in training effects and safety?   How far can it be a substitude for a deadlift? What other exercises do you suggest to make the cable pull through together with those other exercises a good deadlift alternative?   I am also intersted in biomechanical details.  "
2048,How to calculate Calories in KCal from time and distance running,"I am working on a school project and I need a simple equation for calculating the number of Calories burnt when running from time(in milliseconds, could be seconds, minutes, and so on..) and distance(in meters, could be in kilometers, and so on..). Do I need a bodymass? if yes it can be included. Can somebody help me? I've spent 3 days of googling and didn't find a proper answer. "
2049,Influence of physical activity besides the workouts?,"If you have a workout plan that you stick to and your goal is to build muscles: is it counterproductive to work physically after you have done your workout already? For example, if you just did your workout and then, an hour later, you do the washing up or you work in the garden or something. Is such a “habit“ bad for building muscles or gaining strength? "
2050,What is the maximum acceleration a human can generate? With which body part?,"As I was reading the description on the back of a gaming mouse carton, ""50g of acceleration"", I was thinking: ""A human hand cannot possibly get close to this kind of acceleration!"" The ensuing google-search only came up with results as to how much acceleration the human body can withstand, not how much it can produce, so that is why I decided to ask here:  How much acceleration can an average human being generate? (Even if it is just a short burst)  What body part generates the most? How much is it?  How much can the elbow/wrist (whatever is involved in moving a computer mouse) generate? "
2051,The impact of Diet Cola on a low carb diet,"I want to lose weight. I have signed up to DailyBurn to keep track of my weight with weekly weigh ins.    I was confused over the different diets available (Atkins and Paleo were top runners up), so have decided to start off with just trying to adopt a low-carb diet and see how it impacts my weight.   I see friends 2-3 times a week, and we commonly end up hitting some bars. (This is fun and I would like to continue this) I am not a fan of beer, but do like a whiskey and coke. At the weekend, I switched to using Diet Coke/Coke Zero as it has significantly lower carbs/sugars than regular cola.  However - im sure there must be negative consequences from drinking these diet drinks? What impact do diet drinks have on a low carb diet? "
2052,Doing crunches for month and after that stop doing it effect body shape?,I've done crunches for one month regularly in the gym and after that I stopped exercising. And my stomach came out after two months. So is it because I stop doing crunches ? What should I do in order to maintain the same abdomen structure? 
2053,Outdoing years of bad habits and getting into shape,"I'm 23 years old (150 lbs, 5'-7"") and in pretty bad physical shape.  I've been smoking/drinking for the past 7 years and also been living a very sedentary lifestyle. I spend about 8 hours on the computer at work and then 4-5 more at home. That's pretty much what I do 90% of the time.  I've made the decision tonight to quit smoking and get into shape. My posture is poor, I feel tired most of the time, and my endurance &amp; strength are at an all time low.  How you would recommend I go about this given my history?  (I really want to focus on cardiovascular health &amp; posture).  Also is anything (exercise/diet related) proven to help outdo some of the damage from smoking?  "
2054,reverse grip lateral pulldown,"when trying to workout the lats/ lower-lats, does using a reverse grip actually provide any utility in honing in on the lower lats?  Or is the reverse grip just a strategy to have a stronger grip?  Also, for mid-lower lat workouts, is an extremely narrow grip useful, or should you use shoulder width?  Or, does it depend on your physique? "
2055,Where should I start?,"I am fat and I am already trying to eat less and eat healthy. I figured the muscular route to be the best way to get my muscles to show(my body is able to burn fat and gain muscle at the same time).  I am not a bodybuilder but I would rather be muscular than fat like I am now.  I am not sure which muscles to start with. I don't want to lose so much fat that my menstrual cycle stops but at the same time, I want muscle definition.  I remember one time I successfully lost weight while gaining muscle. This was when my Abs were starting to show(upper Abs).  So what muscles should I start with? I know that ideally you'd want to do all of them but I can't do that. Should I start with Abs like last time(first to show up, first to atrophy, prone to injury)? Or should I start with other muscles first? I think I should do arms and legs last since those will be indirectly exercised the whole time. For the same reason,I don't need to do much for my chest muscles(all abdominal exercises also exercise the chest).  This is why I think my Abs should be done first even though it will take the most work to keep the definition. But there is a little of a drawback for me as far as Abs are concerned. No matter how much I do,I can't get my lower Abs to show. Upper Abs, easy, lower Abs, super hard. Lower abdominal exercises(for example leg raises), doesn't help.  So should I do Abs first or not? If yes then will my lower Abs ever show up? If not, then what should I do first muscle group wise? I don't have weights or any muscle specific exercise machinery so exercises with those are off my list. "
2056,How do I fix skinny biceps?,"I've been working out quite awhile and this has always plagued me, skinny biceps. I'm not a small guy(6'2 185lb) and I can curl a decent amount of weight (45's) and I have large triceps, but no matter what I do my biceps stay skinny. They may enlarge but that goes vertical rather than horizontal growth. Is this a predisposition to my body type (tall and slim)? How can I get them to grow outwards, to become ""fatter""?   "
2057,May I take a sleep immedietely after doing exercise?,"I'm currently working on my body building. I found that it is good to do some small exercises like weight lift and thandal on morning.  I’m waking at 5:30 am since I need to do some official work on that time (send an update mail to my US team) and I’ll drink a cup of water and then a cup of milk in empty stomach. Then, I’ll do the above exercise for 15 to 20 minutes. But, my office time starts at 10:am. So I’ll go for a small sleep after the excercise.  Is it good for health? Does it affect my weight gain process? "
2058,"Is wiping off sweat during ""indoor"" cardio counterproductive?","I do about an hour or so of high-intensity cardio each day, usually on an arch trainer or elliptical, depending on what's available. I find that I sweat a lot. The workout itself doesn't feel amazingly strenuous to me but I usually soak all my clothes, and additionally I generally soak through at least two gym towels (not the full-sized ones, but maybe 16"" x 25"" face towels) in every workout.  Usually I find it mildly annoying to have sweat all over my body, so I wipe it off with the towels - which is why I soak two of them every day - but I'm wondering if, on balance, this is doing more harm than good. When I'm running outside I usually don't bring a towel and I just assume that the sweat is performing its function and cooling me down, but the gym I go to doesn't have any fans pointed directly at me, and the arch trainer's built-in fan is pathetic and barely noticeable.  Am I basically causing myself more trouble by wiping off my sweat? Does the sweat I wipe off just get immediately replaced anyway? Could this be hurting my workout?  Note: I usually drink 1L of Powerade Zero during my workout, which seems to replace my electrolytes OK. Years ago I used to just drink water and I'd feel ill after 1-2 hours of cardio, but since switching to Powerade that's not a problem. "
2059,Gaining Muscle/Strength over age 50,"How much muscle/strength could I really expect to gain over age 50? I'm lifting on a regular basis, eating healthy, taking in a lot of protein, have been tested for testosterone levels (at 480 which is avg/high for my age) - so, can I make great gains? no gains? or expect to lose as I age? "
2060,Milk+honey helps gain weight?,"I’m currently working on gaining weight to my body. I just want to know, adding honey to milk will helps for gaining weight or not?   Some said, adding honey with hot milk and cold milk differs from each other and adding natural honey is differ from packaged ones.  My scenario is adding Packed honey with boiled milk. Does it helps gaining weight? "
2061,How is this quad exercise called?,"Does anybody know how the two exercises on this video are called?  In fact it seems to be one exercise and a variation of it, but perhaps the variation has a custom name.  I want to search more information about this exercise and workouts, which include it, but to to so I should know how it is called.  If it has different names in different contexts, please let me know.  "
2062,Breathing during abs workout (Weider 6),"I'm following a series of daily abs exercises to gain a ""6 pack"" (is it called this way?).   As one can see at Weider's Six page all exercises include pulling up legs, chest and face, holding the position for 3 seconds, and then rest for a second.  I found these workouts effective as I gained some abs, however, even if I make it through every workout, I really can't breathe well and always find myself in need of oxygen.  When doing normal sit ups or any ""up-down"" excercise, I can sync my breathe with the movement, knowing when my diaphragm is contracted or relaxed.  How do I breathe during Weider 6 exercises? "
2063,Is warm up exercise necessary for load-bearing and high impact exercise?,"I am new to fitness and will be doing load-bearing and high-impact exercises. It necessary to do warm-up exercises before starting load-bearing and high-impact exercises? If yes, then why it is necessary? "
2064,How much should I exercise given my calorie intake?,"I train every day, usually running 4 miles and doing brisk walking on an incline to burn fat. My calorie intake is less than 1500 calories, and I am burning between 500-600 calories per day which leaves me an average daily intake of 800-900 calories.  Is this enough for a 12 stone man (168 pounds) to stay in good health? I've been doing it for 1 month now and am starting to feel a bit tired with my training getting harder? "
2065,How long should I intake weight gainers?,"I am trying to gain long-term (permanent) weight and got a weight gainer (mutant mass), the bag specify:   Over 1,060  calories per serving 2 shakes a day.   Is it possible or recommendable to intake 2 shakes everyday for long period of times couple of years), just like protein shakes?  By my understanding is that weight gainers, are effective in aumenting muscular mass but once you stop intaking (2  weeks - 1 month) you start going downhill (unless you consume same calory amount in food).  Which make sense since you reduce your calories intake and maintin/increase calory burn.  Is it healthy to keep using weight gainer?  Are weight gainers more like easily getting where you want and then just worry about maintaining your goal? "
2066,"Are protein and fiber obtained from ""shakes"" used by the body as effectively as if they were obtained from unprocessed foods?","Recently I've been frequently consuming protein/nutrition shakes. Sometimes I make them myself using whey protein powder or a mix. Sometimes I buy them from cafe's such as Starbucks' protein/fiber powder containing Vivanno, or one of Jamba Juice's offerings.  I've been wondering though - am I really getting the full benefit of these nutrients when they've just been added to a drink in powder form? Or do I have to actually eat more natural foods like beans, eggs, meat, vegetables, etc, to get the full benefits? Is there any strong evidence one way or the other? "
2067,thick/jumbo jump ropes,"Does anyone have experience with a polydac jumprope?  They seem to range from 1 inch to 2 inches and from 2lbs to 7lbs? I'm use to using a standard and speed jump rope, but these look like an interesting add to my routine (nothing like adding something new!).  I'm assuming the timing/speed work of a traditional jump rope is gone, but the cardio part would increase...? Thoughts? experiences? Any potential injury to the shoulders?   "
2068,presistent cramps for months,"Recently i been getting a lot of cramps. In my calf, feet and even hand. Its like if i curl my feet or hand, a little i get cramp. When i stretch my leg, i get it in my calf. I been a constant trainer but during last three months, i have cut off my training as it got more and more serious. Could it because of bad form,none training or my muscles are going weak? Should i be concern? I want to resume my training, but scared as if i get it when squatting, i might hurt myself real bad. "
2069,Will drinking distilled water improve muscle definition?,"So, basically the question says it all.   This question pop out today at work, a colleague is trying to increase muscle definition and thought at this...   I've read it can lead to undernourishment and dehydration, but could drinking it for a period (3, 5, 10 days?) be of any help with definition.  So Will drinking distilled water improve muscle definition?  And also, How much time one can drink it while being healthy? "
2070,Lifting babies for strength,"I'm a new father (7 months in), and sometimes struggling to pick up and carry my child (previously trained mostly for marathons, so I'm not blessed with copious upper body strength).  As of now, the child weighs 16 pounds.  Since I don't have a gym membership or any free weights lying around, but I do have a convenient 16 pound weight in the form of my child (with the bonus that as she gets heavier, my workout weights will naturally adjust to demand higher load, rather than having to buy heavier dumbbells), will lifting her provide a good, baby-wrangling-specific workout?  How many reps and sets would be recommended? What exercises in particular are suited to lifting a (generally) cooperative baby?  I'm not trying to bulk up, just have sufficient strength to be able to deal with the child on a day-to-day basis. "

My food change was reducing fat intake and increasing vegetables and eating less than before. When fat burns it will burn from everywhere, but I didn't lose fat from my stomach. why??      "
2072,How to find music at 60/90/180 bpm to sync with exercise?,"I follow the recommendation that it's good practice to run with a close to 170/180 bpm pace, at any speed (slow or fast). That is, when running you should be hitting the floor around 180 times per minute, which is near to 3 per second, in a somewhat waltz rythm. I understand this bpm timing is also recommendable for riding a bicycle.  One available resource to get to this pace is a metronome, that is many times included in the features of different watches, such as the gps type.   The broader question is if it's possible to find musics that have this type of rythm. There's a page that does this for you: jog.fm. It's awesome but it just offers song by song ideas.  I'd like to know:  Is there a software that grabs a music collection at 180 bpm?  ...perhaps possible to fetch from my hard drive directly, or online music. Most likely a fitness instructor, or even a dj should be able to answer this. Open source options? Maybe there's even a certain amount of music genre that can answer this directly, say a set of LPs that have this pace.   Is there at least one LP that has a 180 rpm?  I think perhaps something by Kraftwerk, but just guessing. "
2073,"Half Body 5 days a week, enough rest?","As far as I know, training the same muscles every-day (or in consecutive days) is not a good idea. The muscles can't rest long enough to regenerate and you are ""over-training"".  But, as far as I know, the muscles need 36 hours (roughly) to rest. So, in theory, if I want to grow muscles and I have an optimal diet for this purpose, is a routine like this one OK :   Day 1 : Legs (every muscle) Day 2 : Upper Body (every muscle) Day 3 : Legs Day 4 : Upper Body Day 5 : Legs Day 6 : Rest (it's week-end dude !) Day 7 : Rest Day 8 : Upper Body Day 9 : Legs Day 10 : Upper Body Day 11 : Legs Day 12 : Upper Body Day 13 : Rest Day 14 : Rest   (Example on two weeks so your upper body won't be smaller than your legs)  Is there enough rest in this routine ? Knowing that this routine is for ""bodybuilding"".  UPDATE FOR CLARIFICATION  Since some answers are not really answering my question, it seems my question is not really clear.  So, the main question is this one : is training to failure (in 8-12 reps) the same muscles every other day (and with two days of rest per week) over-training ? "
2074,Whey protein recommendation,"I am a moderately active 35 y.o. Three days per week I go directly to an intensive cardio class right after work and get home at 10pm, famished because I don't have time to eat before.  I thought of downing a whey protein drink right as I leave the office as a way to fill up.  I'm not necessarily looking to bulk up -- but just keep fit and avoid eating late at night.  Is this a good idea? What sort of whey protein should I go for? The Internet has loads of suggestions but I trust this community more.   Thanks  "
2075,How long does it take lungs to recover after quitting smoking,"I have smoked on and off since I was 14.  I just turned 27 in July.  I have smoked a mix of tobacco and other stuff.  I averaged about 15 packs a week.  I currently cycle roughly 100 miles a week.  I've noticed my lungs getting weezy and bringing up a fair bit of lung butter. I want to quit , it's not worth my health and I can actively feel that my chest is heavy and constricted the days after I smoke.  How long will it take for my lungs to get back to 100% after I quit? Is there anything I can do to aid the process? "
2076,Improve my bouldering performance on a budget,"I've just started indoor bouldering and it's an enormous amount of fun!  But I'm really struggling to get going. I can just-just finish the easiest routes (and not even all of them) and then I'm completely drained.  The wall I'm starting on has a slight overhang (it's just not perfectly vertical), I'm not sure if that's a good thing for a beginner?  Anyway, I've never done anything active in my life, I'm very skinny, and I have zero strength or endurance. My grip goes very very quickly, but I also have a hard time pulling myself up to reach the next hold. I know I'm not supposed to be pulling myself up too much, but even just the effort to stay on the wall while I stand up is way beyond me. I'm struggling too much to really have a clear mind and look around for the next holds and where the route is taking me so I'm unable to improve my mental technique.  So, any advice on exercises I can do at home to supplement my (I guess) 3-weekly bouldering?  I'm traveling for the next 3 to 4 months and will be doing as much bouldering as possible in that time, but I won't have access to gym equipment and would like to do the exercises in my room.  For my grip: I have a rubber grip exerciser but I'm not sure if I should be crunching it repeatedly or rather just holding it for as long as possible? And how hard should I push myself? Can I do exercises and bouldering every day with good nutrition or should I have rest-days inbetween?  TL;DR: Please help a traveling bouldering newbie with next to no strength or endurance out! "
2077,Defining muscle vs building muscle,"I was taught once by my trainer (he is 75 yrs old) how to train to get defined and how to train to get bulked.   Lower weights,more reps(like 15-20 reps) and slower+controlled movement to get defined  High weights,lesser reps(like 5-6 reps) and controlling only when you are under tension(the lift can be helped by another friend) to get bulked     My question is,is this something true?And if not what training should I do to get defined and what training to get bulked? "
2078,What is the most efficient way to take in calories during a run?,"What is the most efficient way to take in calories during a run?    An ultra-marathon, marathon, and ironman events all seem to be very dependent on being able to replenish your energy reserves. Biking seems to allow you to eat anything, but running is different.    Are Gels + Gatorade + Water the only or best thing?  If so then why only sugar?  Running slow means more fat burning but no one seems to talk about adding fatty foods.  If sugar is key then why not breads or pretzels over higher GI sugar sources?  Is the body only able to process sugars during a run?  And proteins the third source of energy seems to be out of the picture completely; why wouldn't a little bit of protein help?  Why wouldn't the most efficient way include all three sources to some extent?  "
2079,Workout Split - what's a good 4 day split routine,"I'm looking to do a workout split (to see what the impact to my results are) with the focus on strength gain.  I have the split as follows: Day 1 - Legs/Abs - Squats, Lunges (and their variations) + crunches, planks, etc. Day 2 Back/Arms  - Deads, kickbacks, Good Mornings, pull ups Day 3 - Chest/Abs - Bench Presses, kettlebell Day 4 - Lats/Shoulders - lat raises, shoulder presses, shrugs (the exercises listed are SOME of the main ones - I'll be including the typical bar/dumbell exercises and their many variations)  with 2 days of tabata/cardio   Is the body part split correct? Does anyone have any experience to results once they moved to splits? "
2080,Protein mix - How long can it sit?,"How long will a protein mix last before it isn't any good? Should I always mix it as soon as I want to drink it or can I pre mix a few bottles then store them in the fridge? I'm talking about using the tubs of powder, not actually buying the pre-mixed bottles like the 6 packs of Muscle Milk.  "
2081,Lifting to failure - good form?,"Does lifting to failure mean when you can't do a set with good form, or you can't lift at all? Also, what does ""good form"" mean? Let's say for bench press - if may arms shake and move sideways, but it gets up, does that ""count""? "
2082,Beginner to 30 minutes skipping without stopping,"I like to set myself challenges so have been reading about skipping. I've tried skipping before and found it very tough.  I like to set myself challenges, I've built myself up to hit challenges involved in swimming and running and now I'd like to train for skipping.  Is building myself up to 30 minutes skipping a possible target? I'm in reasonable shape but have knackered myself skipping after a few minutes (literally only tried a few times) so guessing that's technique.  I've not been able to find a decent skipping programme online so was wondering whether a similar approach to 5K would work for skipping, although I'm very aware they're different sports but it seems like a possible approach, although I'd expect to find it much harder.  Any advice? Am I kidding myself thinking a 30 minute skip is possible within say 3 months of training, 3 times a week? "
2083,Quadriceps pain after hip bridges excercise,"I have been doing hip bridges for the last two weeks (I exercise three times a week). I am not  aiming to get a muscular body; I am just training to improve my body shape (I am not that fat).  The problem with the bridges is that, when doing them and trying to raise my hips up, I feel pain in my quadriceps, as if I am targeting the quadriceps and not the glutes. Is this normal?   Indeed, what makes me more confused, is what stated in this answer. He said:       What this tells me is that you don't have a strong mind-muscle connection with your glutes. This is called a neuromuscular recruitment pattern, which basically means you use your quads to do most of the work because that's how you've developed. This is really common""   Is this true? If so, am I using only my quads ?  If yes, how to activate my glutes?  Thank you in advance. "
2084,Protein: Mixing with hot liquids,"Is it safe to mix protein powders with hot liquids like coffee? I did this once a while back and it turned into a rubbery blob that sat on top of the coffee. I tried to look it up but there wasn't much available (at the time anyway, 2007). What I found was claims that the protein breaks down and can become toxic. But I read about body builders who bake with protein powders all the time.   Is it safe to mix protein powders with hot liquids? Does it destroy the value of the protein? Does it matter if the powder contains maltodextrin? "
2085,pistol squats: which kind of barbell squat helps the most,"I want to train up to do a pistol squat, and am trying to follow the general advice outlined on the Beast Skills Tutorial, but I'm trying to understand which of the 3 major styles of squats (low bar back squat, high bar back squat, front squat) would be most applicable to pistol strength.  I tried to do a direct pistol progression, but found that my hips and hamstrings were pitifully weak, so I think that basic barbell squatting is a good place to start until I get closer to a level of strength where I could switch over to the skill work I'd need to master the balance / coordination of a pistol.  Would one particular style of squatting me more helpful than the others for this?  Looking at pictures of people on the internet doing pistols, I'd see that:   The shin is relatively vertical The knee is behind the toes The hips are pushed far back     So I'd think that I'd want to train low bar backsquats. Thoughts?  Am I overthinking ths?  About me: I'm 180lbs, and I can low bar back squat 155lbs 3x5.  My goal was to be able to squat 120% of my weight for 3x5, then start working in the skill work for pistols.  I'm still in a very early phase of training squats, so I think this number should rise pretty quickly. "
2086,Which workout to do 1st?,"I am a fitness enthusiastic person. I don't go to gym but choose to workout at home. So that I select some exercise like push ups,biceps curl,tricep dips,squat,crunch,dumbel row each side, plank,sit ups . But I am confused what of these exercise should do first and what to next?? "
2087,Is Saturated Fat really as bad for you as people believe?,"So many people say Saturated Fats is bad for you and you shouldn't eat too much fatty meats or dairy because they lead to high cholesterol. Everyone just takes this as fact without asking for proof.  Does anyone know of any studies that show proof of this?  If someone eats a number of calories that are equal to or less than their daily caloric needs, does the amount of Saturated Fat in their diet really make a difference?  Additionally, body fat is saturated fat. So, if I'm burning my own fat, isn't that just like eating the same amount of calories worth of saturated fat as I have burned? What's the difference.  Please post links to sources with your answers. Thanks. "
2088,How to improve pull-up rep count,"Flat out I can do maybe 1 pull up. What can I do to improve my pull-up rep count other than ""doing more pull-ups""? What muscle groups are used for pull-ups?  "
2089,Fitness plan suggestions?,"I am a 15 year old male, standing at a tiny 5 foot 6 inches and weigh in at 8 stone and 1.1 pound, my fat index is only 10.7% and from my research this suggests that I should go on a lean or ""shredding"" fitness plan. The problem is I only go to the gym once a week due to school and training. Is this a dieting problem or Can I do more in the gym? It could also be useful to note that I usually stay away from the freeweights section as it is usually packed! Can anyone recommend a fitness plan or even an app on android that could help me out?

2091,What is Limiting Factor in Running Fast?,"Say a person can do a 400m run in 1:00, but is unable to do a 1600m in 4:00. What is most likely the main limiting factor in this? What is holding back being able to keep going at this pace for longer? The respiratory system? The lungs? I am assuming that the legs, etc. are strong enough to perform this. I am more interested in what the relative importance of things like the heart and lungs are in this task.  Maybe another way to look at it is for a person who is fairly physically fit through years of exercise, how important are the heart and lungs and other systems in anaerobic exercise?  To me, it seems like the lungs and the ability to get oxygen to the muscles are more important than the heart being able to increase to a high beats per minute, but I am not sure. "
2092,Where should our legs be when we do pull-ups or chin-ups?,"I often see people doing pull-ups / chin-ups with knees bent such that their legs are ""hanging"" behind. Shouldn't the legs be straight down, perpendicular to the ground?   Where should our legs be when we do (standard) pull-ups? Where should our legs be when we do (standard) chin-ups?  "
2093,What credibility or scientific backing does 1g protein per 1lb of body weight have for its applications?,"Say you're of an average weight, not really fat, just skinny and want to put on pounds. People who want to add muscle but are not yet serious bodybuilders(if that's even their goal)are advised to consume 1 gram per lb of body weight to bulk. Bodybuilders are typically advised 1.5-2g/lb.  Now, even overweight people who are trying to lose fat weight are also told the same thing:1g/lb.   But one thing that always intrigues me when I see it(StrongLifts report comes to mind)is when someone claims that consuming excess protein isn't necessary.   One common argument that comes from that stance is that people way back in the olden days(think 1100-1800s) didn't need 1g/lb of protein to put on mass or to get cut. Hell, who even knows if they knew anything about cutting or bulking. Most men were just naturally lean, probably from daily physical labor that was just apart of living back then, and probably due to a lot of natural and unprocessed foods(well, this could still be another question of credibility but it's not the purpose of this post).  And then the assertion is followed up with some drivel about how the ratios are just propagated through things like marketing and broscience to increase the volume of sales of whey and other protein powders. The skeptic in me wants to be like ""Yeah, that does make sense actually, these industries are huge cash cows, etc., etc."", but, I'd rather have an informed opinion.  So I'm wondering, if you want to add on lean weight or lose fat weight is there really any credible research or studies showing that consuming 1gb of protein per pound of body weight has any significant impact on trying to reach your goals?   And how much protein should an individual who is resistance training for fat loss consume per lb of body weight? "
2094,How reliable is this study for the relationship between heart rate and calories burned?,"I am talking specifically about a paper called Prediction of energy expenditure from heart rate monitoring during submaximal exercise.  It states that within the narrow range of 90-150 bpm, there is a linear correlation between heart rate and calories burned as follows:  EE = -59.3954 + gender x (-36.3781 + 0.271 x age + 0.394 x weight + 0.404 V[O.sub.2max] + 0.634x heart rate) + (1 - gender) x (0.274 x age + 0.103x weight + 0.380x V[O.sub.2max] + 0.450 x heart rate)   However, I have my doubts about this. In particular, how come this formula doesn't factor in the metabolic equivalent of task (MET)? Surely the exercise intensity plays an important role in how calories are burned, or is that just purely reflected through heart rate and V02max?  What I find strange is that it takes very little workout intensity to get my heart rate very high. Just today I ran on the treadmill at a mere 4.7 mph (7.5 kph) for an hour at a sustained heart rate between 145 and 155. Going by the HR formula, I burned around 1033 kcal, whereas running at this speed yields an MET of about 8.3, which yields 772 kcal (my MET is 93). That's not even close.  As another example, a game of basketball has me easily averaging a 160-170 HR (even with all the whistles, timeouts, stop &amp; go, etc) and my HR will sustain 20-30 BPM above normal for at least another 30 mins or so after the game.  I don't think I'm necessarily out of shape. I managed to achieve a VO2max above 50 a week ago via the cooper test. I'm a big guy at 6""6, 245 lbs, roughly 20% body fat. Is it strange that my HR increases so fast from running? Does it make me an outlier with regards to this formula? Should I rely on MET values more than this HR formula for estimating caloric burn during exercise? "
2095,"Does for WeightLoss Raw Garlic and Honey help? If Yes, How?","For Past 1 month I am reading one common Natural diagnosis for WeightLoss i.e. Honey dipped Raw Sliced Garlic. Following reason they give:-   ARTICLE 1     Perhaps Garlic's biggest health benefit is in aiding weight loss by   stimulating appetite and boosting digestion. As health experts often   say, a good digestive system is key to a quicker weight loss, honey   and garlic are the ideal companions for your weight loss journey.      Raw garlic has a better nutritive profile than cooked garlic, making   the former a better weight loss agent. Similarly, consuming raw honey   early in the morning may help metabolise fat better.   ARTICLE 2     Garlic effectively increases the metabolism rate of your body.   Metabolism rate is the rate of calorie consumption by time. People who   easily store fat have low metabolism rate. The most effective   component of garlic is allicin, it increases the blood sugar   consumption rate in the body.   Is there any FACT in this? Can anyone confirm? "
2096,How do different modes of transportation compare from a caloric burn perspective?,"Assuming that I'm travelling the same route between two points how do walking, running and biking compare with one another?  My instinct is that calories per mile (metre, kilometre, or what have you) running is going to burn the most calories, but am I correct?  Are there formulae for this?   "
2097,How to train up to 50 pull-ups?,"My target is to do 50 pullups (without coming down in between them of course).  Is it more beneficial (faster for me to hit my target) by doing 1-shot as much as I can or is it more beneficial to split it into like 5 sets but 5 times lesser?  For example, right now in 1-shot I can manage 20.  But if I do 1 and come down, pause, and 1 and come down, pause, I can do a hundred (and possibly more if I just push it)  Side question: is it easier to aim for 50 pullups, 50 chinups, or 50 of 1-hand-facing-1-hand-not ?

2100,I don't eat dairy products yet I cant lose weight,"I am a very active person, I started going to the gym in my freshman year in university in 2012, and I gym 6 days aweek. I use weights for squat,I go for 30 minutes running , eliptical and rarely do circuits (my stamina for circuits is very low). I recently started kickboxing which I am enjoying a lot.   However, and given that I am 5'2'' , I find it hard to lose weight around my thighs! I don't eat junk food at all, I gave up dairy recently in all of its means - I rarely drink lattes- and I eat vegetables daily. I spoke to my trainer who told me that because I am short, running will actually make my thighs even more bigger!   to be honest I don't consider myself fat (im 120lb), but I aspire to be much leaner. Perhaps , would eating bread (for breakfast and lunch in the form of sandwiches) be the reason for me not losing any weight in my legs ?  Any recommendations ?    EDIT: I stopped counting my calorie intake a while ago. However, I only burn around 500 calories in the gym, which I think is low given that I love incorporating carbs in my diet! "
2101,How should I be exercising during the Ramadan?,"With the start of Ramadan, I will be fasting for approximately 12 hours a day (no food or water). Is there any weight loss benefits to running towards the end of the day?   My thoughts being that my sugar reserves would be bottoming out by then. Also, I am a vegetarian so should I try to get more protein when I break my fast?  In the past, I have run or cycled after longer fasts on 40C days, so I know I can do it. "
2102,What additional exercises do I add to the Madcow 5x5 program?,"I just started the MadCow program and appreciate the approach to weekly improvements and regimentation - BUT, I'm used to doing 15-18 exercises per workout (3-4 times a week for about 1 1/2 hours) - the list of exercises take me about 20 - 30 minutes to complete.

2104,How to prepare for exercise at high altitude?,"I am doing the Tough Mudder here in Northern California and the event takes place at a ski resort at an altitude of 6000' to 8000'.  I have been training at about 3000' elevation and I'm wondering if there is anything I can/should do to prepare for exercising at the higher elevation?  I was thinking about going up there the day before and spending about half a day hiking/biking around, but I would come back down afterwards.  Would this even help? "
2105,"Pain in upper chest and upper back, what can i do?","Firstly, the exercises I normally do are running or sports such as soccer etc.  For probably the last 6-12 months, I've been having discomfort in my upper chest. Lately, it feels like it's getting worst. I  think it's completely muscular, as it hurts across a wide area. I have a feeling maybe I strained a muscle in my shoulders or maybe it's the way I'm sitting at work? I'm not sure, it's been happening for long enough that I don't remember when it started.  I went to see the doctor (a GP) and basically, once he was sure it wasn't my heart, he was a bit apathetic about it. He told me to take pain killers for a week. I told him that it doesn't hurt, just causes discomfort, but he said, it was all in my head and after a week of taking the pain killers, my brain will ""forget"" that it's there. He even told me to continue doing sports and stuff.  Is that good advice? I feel like taking pain killers for something that isn't causing me pain isn't a good idea. Should I go to a physio? Should I get some type of massage? Should I do any type of exercise? Can anyone suggest any alternative treatments? "
2106,Typical weekly training cycle of a football club,The problem I am trying to resolve is either dropping off my training too early in the week and feeling a bit stiff on the day we play or I over train and can't maintain speed/power/endurance because my legs are still sore or tired.  I play on the same day every week so I'm interested in finding out what sort of a weekly routine do football teams have as they are also on a weekly cycle and I assume there has been plenty of research done into:   How many days after a game should a player commence full training? How many days before a game should a player rest or pull back from training? Do they rest mid-week and train the day before the game?  
2107,Mysterious body mass gain: could it be water storage due to heat adaption?,"Over the past two weeks, I've noticed about a 3-4 pound gain in body mass, without any noticeable change in appearance (like muscle definition, or what veins are visible where). I do seem to have the vague impression that I have slightly bigger muscles. (Not explained by resistance exercise: I have not been doing any weights at all for two months due to a fractured radius in my left arm.) I haven't changed my caloric intake or reduced my activity.   Could this be storage of water due to an upswing in temperature?  I exercise intensely outside, five days a week or more: it's seven miles each way to cycle to work and back, plus I go running. Recently the weather has gotten hotter. Weather reports are saying ""heat wave"", yet I'm not feeling it at all (my reaction has been, huh? what heat wave?) In fact, I'm feeling more comfortable outside than, say, a month ago.  For instance, I went for an 8 mile run in the heat of the early to mid afternoon, carrying a mere 750 ml bottle of water. Only a month ago, in spite of cooler weather, my mouth and throat would have been going dry, especially after that water ran out, but even before that. Today I noticed that my mouth never dried up, even over the last two miles when I had no more water in the bottle. I sweated profusely; I could easily wring dripping water out of my shorts by the end of the run. Yet I didn't feel thirsty at all during or after. It didn't even occur to me to drink anything when I returned to the office!  Do people turn to camels when they are used to heat, carrying an extra liter or two of water somewhere?  There is no sign of any humps, though, so if this is really the case, I suppose we will never settle the question whether I'm dromedary or bactrian. "
2108,Do protein supplements have any side-effects?,"I need some help in taking the decision to use the supplement. I am trying to build my body but couldn't get a better result even after 6 months of continuous training, when asked my fellow trainer he told me that I was lacking power and needed to take protein supplements in order to build bigger muscles.   Also I have heard people say that using supplements to build your body might have some residual effect on the organs of our body. Is this really true?   Do protein supplements have any side-effects? "
2109,"Are there any disadvantages, besides discomfort, to letting water enter your nose?","A few days ago, I suddenly overcame my fear of getting water up my nose while in the swimming pool, and ever since then, I've been dog-paddling, diving underwater, and splashing around without a care in the world.  Whenever I do this, some water gets up my nose. This is a little uncomfortable, but for me, there are no obvious problems—I can still breathe through my mouth, and I don't inhale any water.  So my question is, are there any disadvantages to letting water enter the nose? Will it cause health problems or something, or am I perfectly fine just continuing as I've been doing? "

2112,Exercise Allergy,I am not kidding about exercise allergy.   I used to go for regular jogs when I used to stay in India (I am from India). Then I moved to Germany a couple of years back and jogging became infrequent since I found the weather really cold.   However I got used to it and when I tried to start jogging again last summer I developed  this allergy. They are basically hives which cover my entire body and stays there for half an hour to one every time I do any sort of heavy exercise. These hives are extremely itchy and I feel a little out of breath.  I cannot jog or do heavy exercises anymore since the allergy is pretty strong now. Has anyone faced anything like this? Is there a solution to this problem? Any comments on how this can be dealt with would be appreciated. 
2113,How do I increase endurance in doing pull-ups?,"I'm doing 5 sets of pullups with each set to exhaustion. However my pullups really decreases after the first two sets. I would start off doing 7, then 5, then i get to 2 or 3 if i really try for the next sets. I'm resting about 2min between sets, and I rest 2 days before my next pullups sessions.   If I rest much longer, I can pull off more. But is that good?  Ultimately my goal is strength, and slowly I've been increasing my pullups number. But how do I perform better for the later sets? "
2114,Workout effectiveness,"It's my 3rd week going to gym. I'm 24 y.o. 87kg, 172cm male. Previously I only did some pull-up and dips. It's 3 times a week  1st day - chest, shoulders, biceps  2nd day - back, triceps 3rd day - legs   The problem is I don't feel tired the next day after the training starting from the 2nd week, while I felt exceptionally tired during every day of the 1st week, and a lot of people say that this means my workout is not effective. I do increase weights and perform set almost till failure though (resting no more than 2 min between sets). For example on the 1st week I was doing bench press with 50kg, 2nd week - 65kg, and 3rd - 70kg, 3 sets of 12 and I could only do 7-10 reps in 4rd and 5th sets.  It it okay to not feel tired after the effective workout? Or do I need to change the routine? "

2116,Is it better to reschedule workout than skip it?,"I go to gym 3 days a week on Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday (chest, shoulders, biceps/back, triceps/legs). This Friday, however, I'm going to leave the city till the next Tuesday. Is it better to reschedule Saturday's workout to Friday, or, increase the amount of Thursday's training? Or, should I do some kind of exercises during the trip? What is the general advice for inevitable training skips? "
2117,Why do I get chapped lips while being on a low-carb diet?,"Whenever I'm doing a low-carb diet or even if I just reduce the carb portion of my daily calorie intake, my lips start to dry out.   After one or two days they really get chapped and crusty. Lip balm doesn't really help. When I increase my carb intake they return to normal after a day.   Is this normal? Why is this happening? What can I do?   Thank you in advance. "
2118,Can't progress any further with my trainings!,"I have been doing this program for quite some time now. There is a bit of progress in terms of technique but my body seems to be unchanged for the past 3 months.   In other terms I do progress a little on my ability to execute my program but I still look pretty average.   This is my program:  Training 3-4 days a week (4 now but it used to be 3)   Day 1, 2 and 3:   3 sets:  10 chinups  50 sec wall sit  30 reversed dips (18kg)   30 squats (18kg raised above head when going up)  20 push ups   10 pull-ups (I fail at this on my third set can do maybe 4 and then I'll have to stop and do two more etc)  10 hanging leg raises   10 upside down shoulder press  Abs:  30 crunches   30 bicycle c.   30 toe touches   20 reversed abs  15 side plank hip lifts right  30 crunches   15 side plank hip lifts left  40 russian twists   30 bicycle crunches   15 oblique v-ups right   20 reversed crunches   15 oblique v-ups left  20 leg raises  Plus 30 minutes running   On my fourth day I usually do some technicals (hand stands or typewriter pull-ups or head banger pull ups) and 1 hour jogging @ 11 km/h  In my days off I try to do 100 push-ups (2 sets of 50)  I don't take any substances. Sometimes I eat a protein bar. I drink once a week. Any idea on why I look average and why I can't see any gains or lose the fat on my abs?   UPDATE: I have not started practicing sport 3 months ago. I have an athletic body and looking to reduce my body fat to 7-8% while keeping the muscle mass intact. I have been doing this particular routine for the past 2.5 months now. I started 9 months ago from not being able to do any pull-ups or chin-ups. It just feels like lately (for the past 3 months) I do not see the same progress as I saw in the first 6 months. I also feel tired and sometimes dizzy in the gym. Would anyone recommend using fat burners to lose the last 4-5% body fat? "
2119,What should be the volume and intensity of a posture workout program?,"I am exercising to obtain a better upper back posture. Hence, I started doing upper back exercises as shown here. But the thing is, I am not sure how the intensity and volume of these exercises should be. There are lots of different information about differences on purposes of training with high weight&amp;low reps, lower weight&amp;higher reps, etc.  The purpose: My purpose is to obtain a better posture in general and in daily life, to be able to keep a straight posture throughout the day. I have read that type1 muscle fibers are the ones that fatigue last. Now since my purpose is obtain a better posture in general and keeping it throughout the whole day, am I supposed to target type1 muscle development? So:   What should be the number of reps and number of sets for each of these exercises? How many days should I give a break to these exercises before doing them again? Are these indeed the exercises that I should be doing? Should I add other exercises to my routine?  "
2120,Training for strength: How is my training regimen and diet combo?,"I'm a student and live a schedule that makes it impossible for me to commit to any extremely serious programs or even go to the gym. As such, I have began to train at home, doing primarily the following:   Pushups with resistance bands, I set the bands so that I can only do 10 reps at max strength.  Pullups     5 sets each to exhaustion for both  I drink whey after the workout, and rest 2 days before I repeat the cycle.  I'm neglecting the lower body, which I know is not that great, but I'm trying to focus on my upper body. I want to be stronger, be more toned and shave off excess fat on my stomach.  Here is my general approach to food. I don't have any goal of trying to count calories or figure out exact protein contents. Instead I eat whole grains, white meat, fish, nuts, vegetables and fruits. In an average meal I would do 30% grains, 40% vegetables and 30% meat or meat alternatives (tofu, seitan, etc). I eat 3 meals a day, with snacks once or twice a day with nuts, seeds, or fruits.  How does this all look? Will I make good progress with this? Do I need to make my exercises more intense?  "
2121,Is it unhealthy to eat jacket potatoes everyday?,"I have recently started the gym and have been going bout 3-4 times a week mostly focusing on cardio.  I'm trying to eat more healthy and i'm quite picky with food, so I tend to have sandwhiches with usually chicken or ham for lunch and then jacket potatoes for tea.  I eat jacket potatoes everyday with a small amount of cheese, as I don't like any other filling. I sometimes have chicken breast with them too.  Would eating them everyday make it more unhealthy than healthy? Am trying to lose weight, so would this help?  Jacket Potatoes are the only food I can think of which I like which are actually ""healthy"".  I understand I should have a balanced diet but as i'm very picky with food its hard to have a range, without just eating junk food.  Appreciate any advice :). "
2122,Exercises recommended for patients suffering from Carpal Tunnel Syndrome,"I suspect that I have CTS (in my right hand) because of most of the symptoms (of the same) do match, and as a result, I haven't been to the gym in a week. I train regularly for 5-6 days a week with weights for building my strength and body, apart from keeping myself fit. I have the following questions provided my hunch turns out to be right after the diagnosis:    Is it recommended to workout with heavy weights and maintain the previous workout chart, now? What kind of exercises and safety measures are recommended as well as forbidden, in general, for those who are suffering from CTS before as well as after surgery?  "
2123,"Abs are built in the kitchen, but what about obliques and lower abs?","I've made some major changes as to what I cook within the kitchen, such as using Coconut Oil, substituting in sweet potatoes, etc.  But I've, as of so far, haven't seen much improvement/visibility in my lower abs and obliques.  Even though trimming body fat is essential to visibility, how can I make these certain abs stand out? I'm an active sprinter who also spends 20 minutes a day toning my abs with various exercises, including P90X ab-ripper and weighted workouts.  Any suggestions in the gym or food wise to make them really stand out? (By food, I mean food I should be consuming more of and food that I might not know has a surprising volume of fat). "
2124,Is my exercise routine healthy & how do I improve core strength and shape?,"I am Quasar, a newbie here! I am 5' 6 (167 cm) and weigh 81 kgs(178 lbs), 32 years of age. Over the last 8 months, I enrolled for a bachelors course in an open university, for which I had to do some rigorous study alongside my full-time job, and I have put on about 8-9 kgs(20 lbs).  I have begun exercising this month. My current exercise routine includes a brisk jog of 3 kilometers each day followed by 10 km of leisure cycling.   I would like to build core strength, better physical endurance, shed the extra weight, tone the body - improve my overall appearance and shape, but healthily. I want to be consistent at exercising and sustain it.  Firstly, would adding more cycling(with a greater slope) for example 30 km/day, and running/sprinting to the routine help? Does it cause too much muscle burn? Is burning 800-1000 calories through cardio healthy?   Second, I have never done strength training my whole life. Could you suggest extremely basic exercises to start off with?  Thanks a tonne friends! - Quasar "
2125,What can I do to have more energy/less sleepy before working out?,"I wake up at 7am, go to college, after go to work, and at the end of the day - when I am as sleepy as 30 bears - I go to the gym.  After returning from gym, I dinner, etc and sleep  What can I do to reduce my sleepiness? Caffeine? Energy drinks?  Please no capsules or powders (supplements) like ASSAULT or Jack3d ! I already take creatine and whey protein.  Also I think something isn't right with my sleep, because I wake more tired than when I went to sleep, it's awkward and bothers a lot, I just can't wake up, I'm a ""zombie"" the first 5 minutes after waking (When I don't back to sleep after waking) "
2126,Should I include cardio?,"I'm 25 years old, 5'10"" and weight 160 Lbs. I'm trying to lower my body fat percentage, but trying to keep the muscle I already have. So, this is what I'm doing:   I'm going to the gym 4 days a week to maintain muscle. I'm consuming at least 160 grams of protein a day to also maintain muscle. I'm consuming no more than 10,500 calories per week to lose fat.   I'm currently not doing any cardio at all, but I'm thinking of doing it the 3 days of the week I'm currently not going to the gym, but I'm concerned about two things:   I've read that cardio is really good at fat burning but works against maintaining muscle mass. I can easily run about 4 miles each day, which assuming burns about 100 Calories per mile without even including the after-burn, would deduct an extra 1,200 Calories a week, leaving me with a net 9,300 Calories, and this does not include the Calories I burn in my gym days either. This leaves me with a 4,700 Calorie deficit for the week, assuming a 2,000 Calorie TDEE. Is this too much? I've read that it's bad to lose too much weight over a short period of time. Does this only apply when the weight is lost purely through diet? Or is it OK to speed up the weight loss through exercise as long as you consume a reasonable amount of food?   So, should I stick to my current program, or should I include cardio? Do my concerns have any validity? "
2127,Skipping ahead on stronglift,"I'm relatively new to mendhi's program of 5x5 and i was wondering if you have to start all the way from what is listed on the program. I can do 2 plates, 5 sets of 5 with ease but on the program it tells me to start with 110, is it necessary to start all the way there? Can't i just start at 225 or atleast a few weights down? What are your suggestions? "

2129,An issue with muscle fatigue without exertion,"Condition: After a twenty minute workout consisting of walking only (Week 1, Day 3 listed here) my arm muscles felt unusually fatigued but not sore.  Question: What may be the specific problem?  (I suspect this may be due to some dietary (nutritional) deficiency rather than direct physical exertion, since I didn't exercise my arms or upper-body region during the workout.)    Follow-up information and question: I've faced this problem for some time now. I used to run moderately for some period some time ago, but gave up because my muscles were becoming very fatigued with only modest exertion. - If possible, may an experienced runner provide some feedback on what specifically might be the reason(s)? And how to address this properly? "
2130,New to fitness. Joined Gym. Trainer is always busy. What do I do?,I joined Gym recently. The trainers dont help much. I was given a card with what exercises to do (2 day split with cardio). I do not know how to operate the machines. No one helps. I would love to do squats and deadlifts but there is no one to teach me or correct my form. I have seen trainers going past people who plank with hips raised high without correcting them. Most of them spend time chitchatting or spotting the big muscle guys near barbells.   What do I do?  I am not saying all trainers are like this or so. I was working out in another gym in another city but there the trainers used to help and correct. I just paid the money and am not at all satisfied with the service. I can point it to the owners but that would just make me a enemy in the eyes of trainers.  How do I go about? 
2131,Am I eating too much fat? How healthy fat help to lose weight?,"I am now following a healthy eating cookbook by a body coach.  I am doing an HIIT training routine he has suggested for 20 minutes, 4 times a week. The confusion I have is the amount of fat I am consuming following his cookbook. His logic is to have carbohydrates only after the HIIT session and food with healthy fats the rest of the time.  He suggests eating healthy fat helps to lose weight? How is this possible? Can someone explain this to me please?  Having a full avocado with bacon for breakfast, is that healthy with the amount of workout I do?  "
2132,Cycling burning fat or calories?,"If I have breakfast and then cycle, say for about an hour at about 80%, will the cycling burn any fat(/muscle) tissue or just the breakfast? If not, would it be advisable to consume no or very little breakfast before the cycling?  Would it therefore be possible to reduce body fat while being in an overall daily calorie surplus?  FYI: I'm rather lean already, 1.88m @ 81kg, training for strength &amp; hypertrophy while hoping to minimize that stubborn little layer of belly fat. "

2134,Are cardio exercises that involve sitting prone to any of the same risks of prolonged stationary sitting?,"There are a number of articles and studies that have found sitting for long periods is harmful. A lot of them cite cardio exercise as a way to help combat the harmful effects.  Is this something specific to the sitting action, or is it more related to being stationary and not engaging muscles? More to the point: Do cardio exercises that involve sitting (e.g. cycling or rowing for longer distances) pose any of the same risk factors as stationary sitting (especially if a large portion of the rest of the day is a sitting desk job)? "
2135,Timing for slow-absorbtion protein ingestion,"It is known that you need to have good timing when eating protein, because this way you'll maximize muscle gain. But the problem is that I can only take albumin (no whey protein), and it is a slow absorption protein. So what if I take it before training? As it takes about 2 hours to be absorbed, would it be more efficient to take it before or after training?? "
2136,Help to add muscle for a skinny guy with fast metabolism,"I'm 20 year old, 5ft8 (1.72m) and weight about 120lbs (54kg).  I've recently joined the gym and plan to add muscle (like most people). I'm completely new to this and I have been browsing for research to see which would work the best for me. For example, I have read about GOMAD and other things about my diet and how I should increase my calorie uptake.  I mainly need help on what I should be doing at the gym to improve, I plan to alternate so go on Monday, Tuesday etc for a 2 hours or so. What exercises should I do and how often?  Any help is greatly appreciated!   I should also say that I have a fast metabolism and also want to mention I don't want to do the GOMAD as too milk has some nasty-side effects so probably 1/4 GOMAD? So that is why I'm deciding for a protein from other sources. "
2137,consequences of lifting weights without enough calories,"For a personal reason I will not be capable to get enough calories (or proteins for that matter).   My question is whether lifting weights will only contribute from now on to ""destroy"" the muscle I've already built, because I understand that the principle of bodybuilding is to cause the muscle to grow by partial destruction of tissues and their subsequent reconstruction (fueled by food and rest).   Is there any chance I could lift without only causing my muscle to shrink ? I suppose not since, ultimately, it's about calories intake and overall caloric balance. But since I still have some fat tissue (and quite a lot of it since I am 20-25% body-fat percentage), I thought I could at least make this an opportunity to lose fat by training without really going for bigger weights, thus I would be at least capable to maintain muscle while dropping the fat, does this reasoning hold ?  Thanks for enlightening me and giving me suggestions.    Here are my stats :    Weight : 170 lbs / 77 kgs ; Height : 5'11 f / 178 cms ;  "
2138,Creatine at its Finest,Hello Im new to this website and Im sure that everyone here frequently gets asked about Creatine. Currently I have been taking C4 Cellucor along with Creacore Creatine by MuscleTech. I weigh 171 and I am trying to bulk up for the next season of Football. I am 5'10' and I am 15. I am trying to become a defensive lineman but I am dumbfounded of what to really use. I work out twice a day and I have been working out for over a year now. Anyone have any suggestions if I should take protein powder instead? or what else to use?

I also joined a gym 5 months ago but due to some circumstances I couldn't continue, but I did not stop doing push-ups at home. I want to gain more weight, muscle and strength. What should I do?   I consider myself a beginner because I have a very little knowledge of workout practices and all those things.  Currently my push-ups workout includes 5 sets of 30 reps.  Thank in advance. "
2140,What is a stress fracture and how can you avoid it when training for a marathon?,"When I trained for my first marathon, I began feeling pain in my lower legs. My doctor said that this could be due to stress fractures in my bone from overworking my body. So my questions are, what is a stress fracture and how can you avoid one while training? Does a stress fracture mean you should stop running altogether until it goes away? "
2141,Stretch marks during weight training,"I am 15 and my height is 5 ft. 7. I started working out about two months ago. I only did tricep push ups, bicep curls, and skull crushers because I was warned that workouts will stunt my growth. I just bulked right away without cutting. When I reached two weeks of work outs, I had stretch marks on my shoulders and biceps. I first thought that it was a scar of honor but as time passed it grew larger and deeper. Right now, it is very visible when I wear tank tops or sleeveless shirts. I want to cure this, but if it is hard to do so, I want to know how to prevent it.  Now I want to ask about the second part of this story. So, my father said that I am growing up and building mass at the same time, and by now my fragile skin cannot take it. He recommends me to workout when I am about 17, when I would already have strong skins that can endure such circumstances. Is this true? or do I just have to live with it. Lastly, this is not that important, but what would people think when they notice my stretch marks? Would they freak out or give me a disgusting look?  People who have already gone through this process, I would be grateful if you help me out.   "
2142,I can't perform a squat without falling,"I am unable to perform a squat with both feet flat on the ground.  Here is a picture of the maximum depth I achieve without falling (while holding the table).     I wonder if it is a problem of ankle mobility, because my feet have a very high arch and in the picture I can't put my knees farther in front of me.  Or if it is a problem with the strength or flexibility of my hamstrings? When I go down I feel that they are very solicited.    Will it be possible for me to perform a full squat one day? Do you have some advice for me to improve my range of motion without falling?   "
2143,Do the effects of creatine wear off as you are using it?,"I've been trying to get through a whole round of P90x for just about the entire summer with out a lot of luck. I always feel very fatigued and tired during my workout. While, I'm not following the P90x diet plan verbatim I do eat very healthy, and get a good amount of protein in my diet. I also only have 11%-12% body fat according to my electronic scale. So I'm not extremely focused on fat loss, and thus haven't cut carbs completely out of my diet like the program recommends.   Recently I remembered when I was in highshool a good friend of mine used to swear by creatine. I did some research online, and decided to try it. I'm on day 3 of a loading phase, and all I can say is wow it makes a huge difference for me. I feel much more explosive, and can lift more weight with many of the exercises. When I use to be reaching for the pause button I now find my self already with a new set of weights ready to go for the next exercise. After a work out I use to want to crash on the couch, but now I feel like I could go for a run.  I have two questions:   First, will this effect wear off as I use it more? Next week when I finish the loading phase, and switch to the regular dosage, will the effect go away or not be as obvious? Second, what does this say about my body? As I understand it Creatine does not affect everyone to the same degree correct? Are there people out there that don't notice the same effects that I'm noticing? Is that because those people already have high levels of Creatine naturally in their system? Does my experience say something about my genetics, diet, or something else about my body?  "

2145,Can weight training cause arthritis?,"I understand that overuse of a joint will likely wear it out faster than usual and may cause osteoarthritis. Overuse of the knee joint by running too much and in bad form is a typical example.   My question is around possible overuse due to weight training. Weight training usually involves far less repetitions (10-30 per session and 2-3 sessions a week, compared to cardio types of exercises that can have hundreds of repetitions of the same joints). With that in mind, would weight/strength training (low reps, more weight) qualify as the type of overuse that may result in osteoarthritis? For example, if I do 3x8 squats (with manageable weights), can it cause osteoarthritis? If it can, then how would the level of damage compare to running? And does it apply to other joints as well; for example, would doing 3x8 shoulder presses cause arthritis in shoulder? "
2146,Does how I spread out Push-Ups through out the day matter?,"So, case 1: I do 20 push-ups every two hours until I have a total of 100 push-ups. Or, case 2: I do 100 push-ups in one session. I take a breather every few push-ups, but I do reach my 100 total, but this time within the span of about an hour. Is there a difference between me doing each case? Which one is more beneficial for me to do? "
2147,Doing splits for fat people,"I am 1.78 metres tall, weighs 125 kg(last I checked) and had a gut size of 46'. Is it possible at all for me to do the splits, and if yes, are there any good methods/advices for me on how to do the splits?  I've never done anything that requires me to be flexible, so I guess I'm pretty rigid. So far, what I've done are leg stretches; basically I stand up and bend down trying to touch my toes. I also have done similarly while sitting down.  Why do I want to do splits? No concrete reason, I guess I just want to be more flexible. As for fitness level, I'm leading a pretty sedentary lifestyle and out of shape. I'm 23 btw. "
2148,What are the best ways to deal with headphone cords while exercising?,"I'm looking to buy a new set of headphones; I don't care much about audio quality, so I use the same pair of headphones for running and normal use, and prefer the kind of earbuds that slip over the ear (even for normal use).  In considering which kind of headphones to buy this time around, I realized that, although I don't mind headphone cords in normal usage, I find them extremely frustrating during running and weight-lifting. So, while browsing Amazon's headphones section, I thought there would be at least some overlap between the Sports &amp; Exercise and Wireless feature categories; turns out there isn't. After doing some digging, there do seem to be bulky wireless headphones marketed for exercise, but most of their reviews make such headphones seem pretty terrible.  Since getting rid of the cords doesn't seem feasible at this point, what are the best ways to deal with headphone cords while exercising? "
2149,I am 15 years old and I'm thin. I want to gain weight and muscles,"I am 15 years old. I study in class 11. Please don't go to my age. I still want to gain some weight. Well, I haven't weighed myself, really. I am thin. I have no muscles. In my school life I was teased a lot. Now in college I want weight. I'm underweight. How am I going to get some weight?   Edited: my diet is just a glass of milk in the morning, then rice and vegetables, then college time starts from 11am to 5pm, and I come home and east last food (rice and others). I know this is less but I don't have time for eating. I go to college on my bicycle, it's a bit far so I lose calories. Shit.  And I have two 3kg dumbbells at my home. Will that work? "
2150,Dead lift - Is it better to pick up racked weight or start from the ground?,"I have always started my dead-lifting by starting with a racked bar (I pick up the bar without the need of bending down), but recently someone told me that a better way to dead-lift is to start by lifting the weight (bar) from the ground. He mentioned that it is better to pick up the bar from the ground for the first rep, because it will increase my strength more, rather than picking it up from the rack.  What I mean by a racked bar is that, when I start to do the dead-lift, for my first rep, I pick the bar up from the rack, and then continue to do the dead-lift as normal, to the ground and back up, My question is, is there is a difference between starting my dead-lift from the ground or from a bar that is racked?  Which is better? "
2151,How useful are protein fasts when intermittent fasting?,"The view that more protein is better generally prevails, though some people advocate occasional protein fasts (for example, and recently, Mark Sisson, a former advocate of high-protein pretty much all the time). Protein Fasts supposedly help with, among other things, protein absorption on high protein days and with the autophagy/recycling of proteins (thereby perhaps mitigating the risks of a high protein diet)...      By protein fasting once a week, you are essentially allowing your body a day to use its digestive machinery to perform self-maintenance. This is because dramatically lowering your protein intake once a week induces autophagy (What Is Bulletproof Protein Fasting)   I'm wondering, though, if protein fasts are necessary on an intermittent dieting regime? I think (but can't find them again) that studies using nitrogen balance suggest that by morning most people have depleted their amino acids (particularly if they aren't enjoying casein before bed).  Mark Sisson seems to think intermittent fasting is enough?     Intermittent fasting imposes periods of zero protein and zero food,   giving your body a dose of autophagy and a respite from mTOR/IGF-1   activation, and likely making higher protein intakes on feeding days   safer   Will resistance training in the morning while fasted, and staying in a fasted state until 10 am or even 12 pm (similar to the Lean gains early morning routine), provide enough protein recycling that protein fasting (say, once a week) isn't really necessary?  Or is it still beneficial to do a whole day protein fast regularly (aiming to get under 15g or 25g ...)?  NOTE:  By a protein fast I mean still eating other macronutrients but avoiding food that is more than about 2% protein by weight.  FURTHER NOTE: To make the 'Physical Fitness' context of the question clear - I'm pondering if low protein days are necessary in an intermittent fasting regime because:    they could increase physical fitness (better protein absorption, healthier mitochondria/more energy, autophagy/general health, this being the main benefit)    or conversely they could   limit recovery (through, for example, extended time without proteins for recovery, particularly for people who train often and fast [a little] often).   FURTHER NOTE: To put the question differently I could ask, ""How much autophagy and protein recycling occurs during intermittent fasting, particularly in the post-workout fasted hours at T = 14h to 17h, compared to 24-40 hours of low-protein (25 g or even less) and minimal exercise?"" "
2152,Is casein protein in cow milk as good as casein powders?,"Milk has an 80:20 casein:whey protein ratio according to Wikipedia.     There are four different types of casein proteins, and collectively   they make up around 80% of the protein in milk   Can skim cow milk be effectively used as a pre-bedtime drink for slow release of casein protein as one sleeps? Do casein protein powders found in health stores offer any advantages over skim milk?  "
2153,Does biking really reduce fats from thighs?,"Is biking really reduce fat from thighs and make them not touch ? Or it transform fats from thigh to muscles and so they will stay at the same size ?  From this link, it seems that biking is useless:     Research suggests you should be burning at least 8,400 kilojoules   (about 2,000 calories) a week through exercise. Steady cycling burns   about 1,200 kilojoules (about 300 calories) per hour.       If you cycle twice a day, the kilojoules burnt soon add up. British   research shows that a half-hour bike ride every day will burn nearly   five kilograms of fat over a year.  "
2154,What's the most efficient way to walk and swim?,"I have two related questions that deal with the same issue. My primary question is regarding swimming.  I've found that extending my stroke (pressing behind behind me to propel me further at the end of the stroke, I'm not referring to reaching far in front of me at the beginning of the stroke) seems to require more energy than what it requires at the beginning portion. At what point during the stroke does your arm lose its efficiency and it becomes worthwhile to begin your next stroke? The question would seem to need a comparison of the additional energy required for a lengthy stroke vs a series of smaller ones that provide the same propulsion. How much energy is wasted performing the preparatory movements for each new stroke? Assume I'm referring to a standard front crawl.  Related to this question is a similar one for walking, hiking, or climbing stairs. How much energy does each stride (or step up on stairs) require versus taking a more lengthy stride? Does this change when loaded with a hiking pack? Does bounding up stairs use more energy than walking them? What if I only used enough energy to allow my foot to clear the upper step and not more?  Thank you. "
2155,Is there a biological reason for women to be weaker then men (in the same weight category)?,"Are women weaker then men because of something biological, or cultural, or both?  Men do have predispositions to be higher and heavier, but lets compare equal weight categories (a 70kg man against a 90kg man would have problems too). Cultural reasons that could be making women weaker:   muscles considered ugly on women (or at least they think so and are afraid to do weight exercises)  men have a big social pressure to have more strength in both childhood and as a teenager, so they often start to exercise early women do the physically easier work when helping out home (the brother helps to cut wood while the sister cleans the house) and this adds up over the years. This continues into adulthood, where men have a higher chance of working in a physically harder job.   Do women gain strength slower with the same intensity of exercise? Lets say there would be two people with identical physique (height, weight, initial strength, age) but of different gender. They both start weight lifting (for example) and they work out with the same intensity and duration and eat the same food. Would they end up equally strong? "
2156,I want to know specific exercises for (preferred yoga) for weight loss considering my slip disk,"Two years back I had fallen from a tree from a height about 2 stories straight standing on the ground. I had the x-ray at that time which showed I was ok. I ignored it and later on the pain grew to start in the back. A year before I had done an MRI scan and the reports were -  IMPRESSION: - OLD PARTIALLY DEPRESSED FRACTURE IS SEEN IN ANTEROSUPERIOR ASPECT OF L4 VERTEBRAL BODY WITH SURROUNDING FATTY MARROW CHANGES? POST-TRAUMATIC SEQUELAE  DISC DESSICATION IS SEEN AT L5-S1 WITH DIFFUSE DISC BULGE AND SMALL POSTEROCENTRAL DISC PROTUSION CAUSING MILD INDENTATION OF THECAL SAC.  I am having my treatment with a good doctor(best hospital in India) and they have suggested me few exercises and said 95% cases like this can be cured with  exercises without surgery. The problem is I am a computer science student and I have to do a lot of work sitting.  Because of that, I have gained a lot of weight. I want to do exercises for weight loss but I am afraid that it could affect my back. So, kindly anyone suggests me exercises for my weight loss and might be some diets along with so that it can go along with my back pain exercise. And I am a pure vegetarian(not even egg). I am 22 years old. Weight nearly 85 kg, height 5.7 f and BMI 29.3. And I feel pain lying on my back straight, so I just lay on side and sleep. So is there a proper posture for sleeping in this case? Thanks In Advance. "
2157,Best way to determine aerobic pace for running,"Context: Aerobic pace makes up a large volume of my weekly mileage. I use 1-2 easy paced runs (slower than aerobic), 1 workout, and 1 long run, and everything in between is aerobic (I've seen it called Z2 or Z3 or endurance)  After reading this study and measuring my blood lactate at my previous aerobic pace, it seems that what I thought was aerobic based on my heart rate, is actually pretty easy for me.  Any ideas on how to determine my actual aerobic pace? The study seems to show the best correlation between RPE and blood lactate (which is the best indicator of what system is being trained) and the worst correlation between HR and lactate. For sure, I'm scrapping my HR readings. "
2158,Can you train yourself to respond well to training?,"Lots of people's fitness goals are around achieving and maintaining a level of fitness - a curve that rises then reaches a plateau.  My lifestyle prohibits that, but I do find that I train up quickly.  I'll fit in a handful of runs each year, randomly spaced depending on my circumstances and motivation.  I managed two in the last week.  The first one was really painful, and I was overtaken by old ladies walking their tortoises.  On the second I overtook some fit-looking guys and ran up a big hill - still painful, but apparently much fitter.  That got me wondering if you can train yourself to train up quickly.  Perhaps my ""regime"" of intermittent runs is helping that?  Or is it more likely to be my genetics or some other luck-of-the-draw?    The clumsily-drawn graph shows how I think this might work.  The blue line shows a conventional fitness goal, while the red line shows someone whose fitness develops at the same rate (same slope) as the blue person on their first training iteration (until they stop training), then on the third iteration they get fitter much quicker (the up slope is steeper, and it tails off more slowly).   "
2159,Shoulder strength imbalance after injury,"A few months ago I injured my right shoulder (collar bone area) playing contact sport.  I haven't played or done much training at all since then. I joined a gym recently and they did a body composition analysis thing which showed less muscle mass in my upper right body (where the injury is).  I started doing some training, weights and cardio etc... Nothing massively strenuous and I noticed that with the shoulder press I was struggling with my right side. At the end of the second set my left arm was still going strong but my right arm just couldn't complete the lift.  It wasn't painful, just had no strength. Obviously, I don't want to injure myself and I will try to find someone to speak to in the gym but I was looking for advice on how to balance up my strength.  Should I try less weight until my right shoulder gains more muscle? Should I keep going at this weight but stop when my right arm can't go on? Should I do different weights between my arms?  What's the best approach here?  I hope that I have provided all the required information but if there is anything else that would help I'd be happy to provide it.  Thanks "
2160,How can I reduce bloating while taking creatine?,"From a recommendation I grabbed a tub of Jack3d which is basically lemonaid with a ton of caffeine, but it also contains creatine. After drinking just one dose with 8oz water, I am bloated the next day in my midsection.   I've taken creatine mono and creatine hydro individually before and didn't notice any bloating. I did try another mix last year (bascially kool-aid and creatine, no caffeine) and there was some bloating but I was able to get it down with diuretics.  Diuretics don't seem to be helping in this case. What's the deal? How can I reduce bloating while taking creatine?  Water in take is probably ~64oz avg on normal days. "
2161,Are commonly-accepted health risks of steroids real?,"I recently watched Bigger Stronger Faster, a documentary on steroid use, and was struck by their claim that commonly accepted health risks are not proven and seem to mostly be accepted because of intense government marketing (a situation not dissimilar to the misleading nutritional recommendations published by the USDA and others). In particular, they claimed that ""roid rage"" is a myth (anyone who was going to go into a rage had that in their personality anyway) and that links to e.g. cancer are speculative and very little research has been done to this effect.  In order to try to track this down, I went to the relevant wikipedia page and found the following paragraph on health risks:     Health risks can be produced by long-term use or excessive doses of   anabolic steroids[citation needed]. These effects include harmful   changes in cholesterol levels (increased low-density lipoprotein and   decreased high-density lipoprotein), acne, high blood pressure, liver   damage (mainly with oral steroids), dangerous changes in the structure   of the left ventricle of the heart[citation needed]. Conditions   pertaining to hormonal imbalances such as gynecomastia and testicular   atrophy may also be caused by anabolic steroids.   What's notable is that citations are needed on this entire set of claims.  So the question is, can anyone fill in these citations? I would like to see viable studies (or popular works that reference these studies) that can either back up or debunk these claims? "
2162,How to improve my leg strength to perform pistol squats?,"I can easily do pistol squats on my right leg, but I am not able to do the same on my left leg. Why is there this kind of strength imbalance and how can I correct the imbalance? I never trained my right leg separately i had always trained them equally (trained them with same no. of reps).. Does this mean my form has been defective? "
2163,Training rear delts,I'm training the rear delts in a reverse-benchpress movement. The problem is maintaining consistent elbow positioning. It is too easy to compensate for progressive overload by tucking the elbows closer to ones torso than one should. Eventually one ends up with a weight too heavy to do the exercise correctly. Progressive overload results only in the progressive lowering of the elbow instead of strength-progression. Like Athlean-X demonstrates here:  [website]How can I prevent this? 
2164,Why can I run at 90-95%HRmax but not bike at more than 80-85%HRmax?,"Is your HRmax when biking different then for running, or can you train to raise the HR you can achieve when biking to comparable levels? I think your absolute HRmax - the point when you faint - is different than the HRmax achievable by just running, so maybe its different for different activities? "
2165,What is the best way to break down a 60 minute gym workout?,"I am just about to start a fitness/nutrition regimen but I am not sure exactly where to start. I will be able to do 5 days a week but thought it might be best to start with 3 days a week (Tuesday, Thursday, Saturday) for the first two or three weeks. I have a membership at Bally's. How can I get the most out of a 60 minute workout at the gym? I am programmer working what equates to two jobs and spend all of my time sitting. When not working, my time is occupied by two young kids and my wife. Being very busy has led to the sorry state my body/health is in.   I am going to be working out before work (at around 6am) and my time is limited, so I want to spend the time wisely. What machines should I use, how much weight should I start with, and what can I do to maximize my results in the most efficient way possible with the 60 minute restraint? As far as goals I want to be about 20 - 30 pound lighter but this is really just secondary - my priority is being healthy. I want to make sure I am around a long time, feeling good, and enjoying life.  Specifically what machines should I use, how much of the 60 minutes should be cardio, stretching, or lifting? Any advice or tips would be very helpful! "
2166,Best timing and amount of protein intake for building mass,"I'm 18 years old and started bodybuilding two years ago. To build muscle mass, I want to optimize my diet/nutrition.  I know that 2g of protein per 1kg body mass would be a good choice and one doesn't need more than that. Anyway, this is not the point I want to discuss.  Assuming I weigh 80kg (which makes about 160g protein per day): What is the best way to split that amount of protein into single portions and what is the best time to take them in?  What I do at the moment is:   eating as much as I can in the morning :D (preferably carbs) try to ""eat as much protein as I can"" in the course of the day eating 500g of low-fat quark/curd (60g protein) before going to sleep taking in about 60g of protein in the two hours after training   Is this a good plan? Or rather stupid and recommended to be changed?  Thanks in advance for your help! "
2167,Intermittent fasting spacing between meals,"I have a question about IF, the fasting part is easy, do not eat... but lets say i only eat from 15:00 to 21:00...  Does it matter if i eat every 2 hours (3 times)? 15:00, 17:00, 19:00 Would be better to eat at 15:00 then at 19:00? What happens if i eat non stop during this 6 hours? (but still counting calories), does it affect insulin or something that prevents me from burning fat? "
2168,How to increase bicep (bar) curls?,"My progress on bar curls has dropped. I understand any form of bar curl is the staple bicep exercise so i'm wondering what is a good change up or strategy to improve (increase) the weight I can curl?  I don't have a separate day for arms so I target biceps with back. This typically involves starting with 4 sets of pull ups, then a 2 back exercises (4 sets each) such as rows, deadlift or lat pulls. I then move onto biceps and do 4 sets wide grip ez bar curls followed by 3 sets with the narrow grip. By the end my forearms are aching and I have a good pump in my biceps. However the weight isn't really increasing.   As my train back and biceps together i'm hesitant to target arms first, to avoid fatiguing them and subsequently not hitting the back hard enough.   What can I try? "
2169,Is increasing resistance the only possibility to build more muscle mass?,"I've often read and heard that you can only build more muscle-mass (get stronger), if you continuously increase the resistance weights (e.g. here).  But for me, it's the case that I'm often not able to increase the resistance. I have to take the same resistance weight as before (regarding training over several weeks) because this is all I can do.  Is it really correct that my body won't build more muscle-mass because it needs increasing resistance? I mean, this resistance is the limit for me - so why should a constant weight be too little?  This is my current schedule for training:  Monday:   2 exercises x 3 sets x 8-12 reps: back (trapezius etc) 2 exercises x 3 sets x 8-12 reps: biceps (brachii) 2 exercises x 3 sets x 16-20 reps: abs (abdominal)   Wednesday:   2 exercises x 3 sets x 8-12 reps: chest (pectoralis etc) 2 exercises x 3 sets x 8-12 reps: shoulders (deltoid etc) 2 exercises x 3 sets x 8-12 reps: triceps (brachii)   Friday:   see Monday   Monday (next week):   see Wednesday (start this week with the second part now)   Someone told me to change the plan to the following:  Monday:   2 exercises x 3 sets x 8-12 reps: back (trapezius etc) 1 exercise x 3 sets x 20-30 reps: abs (abdominal)   Wednesday:   2 exercises x 3 sets x 8-12 reps: chest (pectoralis etc) 1 exercise x 3 sets x 20-30 reps: abs (abdominal)   Friday:   2 exercises x 2 sets x 8-12 reps: biceps (brachii) 2 exercises x 2 sets x 8-12 reps: triceps (brachii) 2 exercises x 2 sets x 8-12 reps: shoulders (deltoid etc) 1 exercise x 3 sets x 20-30 reps: abs (abdominal)   Is this a better schedule?  Stretching  I must admit that I've never done stretching as a part of my fitness training. I know this was a mistake. But could this even be the cause for my lack of strength? "
2170,How to lose fat and gain muscle at the same time?,"Firstly, is losing fat and gaining muscle at the same time possible? If it is possible, what is the general nutrition and exercise plan to do it?   Secondly, is losing fat and gaining muscle at the same time not efficient for bodybuilding? Most bodybuilders have a heavier off-season weight than contest weight, which implies that they go through a bulking phase a distinct cutting phase. Here are examples of pro bodybuilder's phases:  Jay Cutler   Contest: 274 lb (124 kg) Off season: 310 lb (140 kg)   Ronnie Coleman   Contest: 297 pounds (135 kg) Off season: 330 pounds (150 kg)  "
2171,What is the proper way to hold your arms while training your biceps?,"When I work out my biceps I do:  1: 4x15 chin ups (84 kg me)     2: 4x15 barbell curls (30 kg)     3: 4x12 concentration curls (22kg)        4: 4x12 cable preacher curls (62 kg)   My problem is with my forearms ,they hurt badly when I start doing barbell curls but not while I am training but when I am done with each set of 15.  Is this a problem with how I am holding my arms?Am I using the wrong barbell maybe?Or my forearms just cant handle this much weight?  EDIT:  I realized I have this type of pain :[website]Do you consider his tips viable to help with my problem? "
2172,Combining squats and deadlifts: do deadlifts on light or heavy squat day?,"Currently I'm doing 3 workouts per week: Monday, Wednseday, Friday. There's two workout templates, A and B, which simply alternate. It's basically the StrongLifts 5x5 and Starting Strength approach. All workouts have squats, and until now the deadlift was on workout A (so one week there'd be two deadlift sessions, the other week one). The deadlift is only done for one work set after warm-up. Thus far, the weight on the squats was increased every workout.  The plan was to turn Wednesday into a lighter back-off day for the squats once recovering started getting heavy, and at that point also do only one deadlift session per week. Since I'm feeling some lingering back stiffness from workout to workout, and progressing on the squats and deadlifts is getting increasingly difficult, now seems like a good time.  The question then is, which day would be best to put the deadlifts on? I can either put it on one of the heavy squat days (Monday/Friday) or on the lighter squat day (Wednesday). There's advantages and disadvantages to every choice.   On Monday I'd have to do it after heavy squats, with my back and legs already tired. But the last workout will have been 3 days ago and it being the start of the work week I'll still be fresh. On Wednesday the squats will have been lighter and will interfere less with the deadlifts. But it's intended as a day to facilitate recovery and doing deadlifts on that day might defeat that purpose. On Friday there's the same problem as Monday: heavy squat + deadlift. But I tend to be enthusiastic cause the weekend is around the corner, the deadlift is the last exercise I do so I tend to have a ""let's go mentality"" and I'll get a whole weekend to recover from it, unlike Monday/Wednesday.   Is there any choice that's definitely better? My goal is to continue linear progression as long as possible and gradually move into the Texas Method programming style (where deadlifts are on the volume day, but I feel more inclined to put them on the intensity day). "
2173,Diet/Weight gain for Skinny guy with belly,"My question is specific to my food diet and it isn't a direct duplicate of this question  I'm 5-11 and weigh about 60kgs. My body is extremely thin and I recently I noticed a belly and it's pretty pronounced. I started the gym about 1.5 months back doing mostly compound exercises such as benchpress, squats, shoulderpress, deadlifts. I work out on 4 days a week (but try to do 5.)  Now this is the gym portion. My concern lies in the food/diet portion. I read that more calories = more weight. Since I'm not a heavy eater, I tried to narrow down on food that are less in quantity yet give good enough calories.  I now eat these two heavily to push my calorie count   Peanut Butter Pasta (it's a pasta with maker sauce)    What really concerns me is, everyone mentions that too much pasta will actually add fat to my body. Is it true ? I don't know if that particular Pasta is really helping me gain good calories ?  Also, do I need to starting doing treadmill to reduce my belly ? (will it reduce my muscle or fat ?)  I want to gain weight but not in belly. :|  EDIT: I do strong lifts 5x5. My main question is that will eating pasta simply contribute to my tummy or will it distribute evenly (given that I exercise as I am doing now.) "

2175,Why do we ice after strenuous exercise?,"Inflammation is an essential part of healing. From Wikipedia:     It has been further theorized that the acute localized inflammatory responses to muscular contraction during exercise [...] are a necessary precursor to muscle growth. As a response to muscular contractions, the acute inflammatory response initiates the breakdown and removal of damaged muscle tissue. Muscles can synthesize cytokines in response to contractions [...] These acute increases in cytokines, as a response to muscle contractions, help initiate the process of muscle repair and growth by activating satellite cells within the inflamed muscle. Satellite cells are crucial for skeletal muscle adaption to exercise. They contribute to hypertrophy by providing new myonuclei and repair damaged segments of mature myofibers for successful regeneration following injury- or exercise-induced muscle damage; high-level powerlifters can have up to 100% more satellite cells than untrained controls.   Now, why is icing your tendons and muscles after strenuous exercise beneficial? It certainly relieves pain, but does one lose some hypertrophy gains by not letting inflammation take its course, or does icing not actually reduce the immune response? "
2176,Cheap Alternatives to Meal Prep,"A well known fact in the fitness world is that a big portion of results come from dieting. Now, I know what foods are healthy and which ones aren't. That's not an issue for me; however, I seem to have issues with meal prep, and I really hate the texture of salad. I'm definitely an on the go type person; I am always moving, and my kids make life even more hectic. Due to this, the idea of meal prep has always been daunting to me. I've done it one time (a week's worth of meals) and absolutely hated it. It took hours, my food as always was bland and tasteless, and then microwaving it made it worse. So as a result, I am here wondering if you guys can help me out?   What are some cheap alternatives to meal prepping?   Things such as box meals and quick easy foods are preferred but not required.  I am not a fan of the following:   Fish (though I will eat tuna) Salads Seafood Avocados and similar fruits. Most melons. Squash and Zucchini    I know that I can always cart around bags of carrots and similar vegetables, but I am hoping someone knows of some whole hearted meals that have just about everything I could need in a simple alternative. The cheaper the better obviously because my kids get all the good stuff. :D    Also, please understand that I will consider meal prepping foods that are quick and hard to make tasteless. For example, throwing 5lbs of chicken breast into a boiler with 10 sliced bell peppers and some chili powder is kind of hard to mess up and only takes about 20-30 minutes to prep a week's worth of lunch.    Thanks in advance! "
2177,Window to utilize protein after weightlifting?,"Suppose I did a weightlifting session at an intensity that stimulates muscle growth. At what period of time after the session does my consumption of protein stop contributing to the growth of the stimulated muscles?  For example after a workout, steak is consumed [1 hour, 24 hours, 72 hours] after the session. Does protein from the steak get utilized for muscle growth of the stimulated muscles? "
2178,Caloric Deficit + Positive Nitrogen Balance,"QUESTION: what percentage of calories from protein, carbs, and fat do I need in my diet to remain in a caloric deficit and in a state of positive nitrogen balance?  See: [website]I'm just starting to exercise regularly (mostly focused on HIIT) and diet properly. Soon, I'd like to focus on also building muscle. As I still have a lot of fat to shed (I'm 5'11"", 213 lbs / 96.6 kgs), I believe I need to remain in a caloric deficit. And in order to help my muscle building efforts, it seems that I need to be in a state of positive nitrogen balance.  Per [website]   164 grams of protein  x   4 calories per gram of protein ------  = 656 calories from protein   I have a budget of 1,780 calories per day to remain in a caloric deficit and lose up to 2 lbs per week. So about 37% of my calories should come from protein. I have 63% to split between carbohydrates and fat -- and I'm not sure how to do it.  UPDATE: [website]"

2180,How to measure balance?,"Balance is important: studies have shown it helps prevent injury (for example, this study (in Spanish)), it's useful when transitioning to barefoot/minimalist running (see this or this) and proprioception training is a staple of post-injury rehabilitation programs (this study has references to other studies to back these claims; it's itself concerned with upper-body proprioception). As I feel I am lacking in this area of fitness, I have decided to work on it. Unfortunately, I'm not sure how to measure my progress.  I've heard of something called a Flamingo test - standing on one leg with eyes closed and measuring how long you can keep it up. Here I assumed swaying around is not acceptable, but what about the small muscles in my foot? I feel them working and my making ""microcorrections"" (which is what I'm trying after all), but am I supposed to only measure time I am standing perfectly still, or is feeling movement/twitching in my foot alright for the Flamingo test? Also, are there any other tests to measure my balance, especially once I've progressed past the Flamingo test.  My current routine is basically the flamingo test, repeated 10-20 times per day, barefoot on hard surfaces. It is my understanding that once this is effortless (defined, I suppose, by not feeling any twitching in my foot) I can progress to turning my head (so as to further constrict the inner ear fluid effects on balance and focus solely on somatosensory input). I assume that by this point the flamingo test will be too easy and a different test will be needed. "
2181,How to make a well balanced diet?,"There is so much bogus information on ""how"" to eat that its overwhelming. So i have a couple questions. What would the perfect diet look like (not carrying about actual type of food just its make up)? For instance would it be 50% protein, 30% carbs ... you get the idea.  As to the percentages would you want to adjust these throughout the day? More protein say early am and less at night?  Are eggs good or bad? I am really sick of this one. I love eggs and in one study they are perfectly fine to eat even everyday and in others you should limit them. In another just the whites, and yet again in another it doesn't matter.  Getting ready to start a new workout routine and diet. Quit smoking after 20 years and finally feel like trying to get in shape but i am trying to weed through all the information and its proving more overwhelming then I could have anticipated.  Edit:  How do these things change when planning a meal for a workout and does the workout meal take place before the workout or after. Lastly how long before/after should the meal take place?  "
2182,Is stretching after bodybuilding workout advised?,"I heard many things about stretching but recently, I had 2 different (and opposite) advices about it. Both were from certified trainers.  One said that, after your workout, whatever your workout was, you have to stretch to prevent injuries, DOMs, and to help muscle recovery.  The other said that, when you do a bodybuilding workout, you must not stretch and stretching after workouts will increase injury probabilities without any advantages.  I do 6 workouts a week (~1 hour each, half body every day) and stretch (static) after every workout, every muscle involved in the workout, because I learned to do so years ago when I was doing martial arts, but it's not the same exercise and the flexibility requirements are not the same.  Who is right ? Should I continue stretching after each workout ? "
2183,"What are the benefits of hypertrophy training, if you have pure strength goals?","At least relative to bodyweight.  I know that one is supposed to train not only in the low rep ranges when the goal is maximum strength, but to also squeeze in some 8-12 rep sets when going for strength relative to bodyweight. But why? Wouldn't hypertrophy be counter productive to that goal?  Or is there a case to be made for training exclusively in the 1 to 5 rep range? "
2184,antagonistic movements: Dips Into Chin ups or Overhead press into Chin upss,Post inspired by What are supersets and are they even worth doing?  The video has sources suggesting that antagonistc supersets are superior to normal sets in terms of muscle growth and strength gain.  To maximize the effect should I superset chin ups with ring dips or with overhead pressing?   Source of my confusion: Both dips and overhead presses are vertical patterns that work the front of the torso.  
2185,What is proprioception?,"I've been seeing this term pop up lately in like in this question about measuring balance, but I'm not familiar with what it means.

2187,Breathless after 50m front crawl,"I just started learning to swim a few months back. From barely being able to float for a few seconds, I am now able to swim along an entire length (25m). However there are two caveats: 1) I almost always use a hand paddle - my bare hands never catch as much water efficiently. 2) even with a paddle, I am breathless after 25m. Making another 25m seems an uphill task for the next few minutes.  Moreover, I am unable to continue any further. My body is restless and my heart beats faster during my next 25m; consequently somewhere midway to three-fourths along the pool, I lose my balance and from thereon, start walking to the near end.    While I would love to believe I shall improve and this too shall pass, this has been going on for more than a few months. I have incorporated a lot of Internet advice:  go slow, relax, more water displaced per stroke, look 45 degrees ahead in water, focus on hips for kicking, rotate well. While they all have helped me improve to some extent, the core issue of breathlessness persists. Is this to do with my lung capacity and stamina?   Is there anything I can do to get better?  PS: I have zero difficulty with backstroke; with breaststroke I am comfortable for up to 50m. My knees start aching after that, but there are no breath issues. "
2188,What should be recorded in my workout journal,"What kinds of information should be kept in my workout journal? Should it just be a matrix of stats (exercise name, weight, reps, and date) or is there other important information that should be recorded on normal basis?   What should I record in my journal and what have others found to be useful journals while bouncing around a gym (paper, phone app, nothing and just record it later)? "
2189,"The ""science of fullness"" diets?","I noticed at my local convenience store a nutrition bar I hadn't seen before -- FullBar. I was intrigued by the concepts of the ""science of fullness"", which is documented on their site:  [website]     Fullbar is inspired by the principles of weight-loss surgery. When a person undergoes bariatric or lap band surgery, a device is installed to constrict the stomach. The result is that when food is ingested, it stretches out the upper part of the stomach, telling the brain that you're full.   When you use fullbar products, your stomach fills up on less food, causing you to feel satisfied with smaller amounts of food, so you consume fewer calories during meals, helping you lose weight.   fullbar works best when consumed 30 minutes before lunch and dinner or as a substitute for your daily snack. Make it part of your everyday routine, and fill up on any all-natural, fullbar product and a 16-ounce glass of water.   Before meals really notice your level of fullness. This is key. Assign your hunger a number from 1-10. Then when planning your meal, monitor how much food you're making and prepare a smaller portion than usual. Don't worry - even if it's only a fraction of what you'd normally eat, you'll still feel full.   As you’re eating, pay close attention to how your hunger lessens as you eat. Stop when you become satisfied, not when you become stuffed.      I have some questions about this.   Are they full of crap? I understand how stomach reduction surgery works, but is there other science corroborating this as a workable diet principle?  Are there other diets that exploit this ""make the stomach feel extra full on relatively low-calorie but stomach expanding foods before eating full meals"" principle? If #2 is yes, what types of inexpensive, tasty foods can be used to exploit this principle.. other than buying FullBars of course. :)  "

I am not interested in weight loss or burning calories, just in allowing me to run for longer amounts of time without taking a break.  I have a treadmill available for this effort.  Edit: I am not training for any particular sport or event, I just want the best results.  I would classify my fitness level at ""moderate"" - I'm not overweight and have lifted weights on and off for 10 years.  A more direct question is: in 20 minutes on a treadmill, is it more effective to jog for 19 minutes, run for 15 minutes or sprint for 10 (where the off-time is spent walking/recovering)?  "
2191,Underhand press ups,Are weighted and unweighted underhand press ups safer than normal press ups?  Some forums says underhand bench press has 30% more upper pectoral activation and  since the bench press and the press up have pretty much the same motion I guess this applies to both.   But is it actually true? Also some forums says it safer while others say it's just a stupid way to get injured fast. 
2192,Lower back pain when performing lying leg raise,"I was trying to do the exercise  ""Leg raising"" :  The problem is that : First it feels very difficult while raising my legs with a sharp  lower back pain. Inaddition, during moving  my legs up and down , it is very difficult for me to keep my  back steady on the ground. For these two reasons, I used to put my hands under my butt, the exercise becomes easier.  Is it normal to feel such lower back pain ?   What about my unsteady back?    Does Anterior Pelvic tilt affect performing such exercise?   Is putting my hands under my butt corrupting the exercise? "
2193,How do I come to a stop while ice skating?,"When I've gone ice skating, I've always just let friction eventually slow me down (or the wall). I don't want to do this anymore!  What can I do to train myself to stop properly? What is the process of coming to a complete stop at will, the form the body should take, and the muscles that are actively used while doing so? "
2194,How to maximize mitochondrial biogenesis?,"The question says it all: How can I increase the mitochondrial biogenesis? (The creation of new mitochondria)  All sources I found say, that it is increased if there's enough demand. So what kind of exercise maximizes the demand?  This topic is related to this forum due to the impact on mitochondria on overall fitness performance.  Mitochondria are the active mechanism in cell's production of ATP - or raw energy.  The more mitochondria present in one's system, the more overall energy can be recognized.  In fact, some studies indicate mitochondria has a profound and direct association with lifespan (ie, the more mitochondria, the longer the lifespan).  This thought is supported by such products as Hammer Nutrition's Mito Caps.  This question assumes that mitochondria are required for energy and asks how can one foster the creation of more mitochondria via mitochondrial biogenesis. "
2195,How do I remove and prevent calluses from weightlifting?,"When I am lifting weights, I noticed that there are calluses that form at the base of the fingers. I am fine with them but sometimes the start to dry up and peel.   Is there a way to remove them?   Also, I surmised that wearing gloves while lifting weights will minimise the calluses but is there another way to prevent them without wearing gloves?  "
2196,Do I need a post workout meal if I eat right before my workout?,"So we all know about pre and post workout meals and how important they are. Due to my current scheduling at college especially since it is my last year I always find myself doing my workouts directly after I eat dinner. I had a while ago asked my doctor if this was a bad thing and according to him if I am eating directly before my body will simply be delaying digestion to after my workout and my body is able to return to its normal states. He is not the only one to mention this and from what I have gathered it is no myth. Depending on how long you wait before engaging in strenuous activity your body may delay digestion and due to how soon I do afterwords (less than 5 min) I certainly am.  Now when it comes to post workout meals many are arguing half one way half another some say I should still digest something after I workout others say there is no need. In my OPINION which is not at all to knowledgeable about this People saying I absolutely should eat something after makes no sense to me. If I am eating directly before hand and my digestion is being delayed there should be a small in fact a very minimal difference between that and choosing to eat my meal after.   So who is right in this situation? And if I should be eating something after what is pointing to that, why should I be? "
2197,What's the purpose of this adjustment on the rower?,"My club has a rower.  It has an adjustment on the side that looks like this:    I see other people using the rower with the adjustment set up high (7-10).  I asked the trainer and he said, that sets the resistance for the machine, so, I should set it high to get a good workout.  I wanted a good workout, so, I followed his advice.  It was hard for me to use the machine because it felt heavy when I pulled on the handle.  Was the trainer correct? Do I have to set it to a high number for a good workout? "
2198,Leg Training with Patella alta,"A few days ago I visited my doctor because I got pain right besides and under my kneecap in the right leg when walking and going up/down stairs (only when extending my leg and only sometimes, it's pretty weird). However, after examining me he could not find anything that might cause the pain and speculated it has something to do with my training.   My current leg exercises: leg press (would love to do squats, but there is no squat rack in my current gym), machine leg extensions, machine leg curls, romanian deadlifts, standing calf raises. - after my knee started to hurt about 3 weeks ago I stopped doing leg extensions and curls because I read about them being really bad for your knees. The pain got less, but still remains to this day.  My planned new leg exercises: leg press, split squats/lunges, gliding leg curls, romanian deadlifts, standing calf raises  Since I have Patella alta (maybe genetically or something, I never had an patellar tendon rupture), are there any particular exercises I should strictly avoid? I also asked my doctor that question but he couldn't answer it cause he's just a general physician. The local orthopedist has waiting times of around 1-2 months, so I'm seeking some advice until I got my appointment there in November.  Are the new leg exercises I planned to implement into my workout routine suitable for my condition? If not, what exercises do I need to avoid and why? "
2199,What to do against side stitch?,"Who am I  I started running about two months ago. Before that I occasionally played football/soccer so one can say that I was out of shape but not to a very high degree. As a teenager though I played football at least three times a week. My weight is 87kg/190lbs and I am 1.88m/6.1feet tall.  The stitch  During my running sessions I continuously get side stitches approximately after 4km/2.5miles and I recall, that I also used to get side stitches all the time in my youth. Sometimes the side stitch is so painful, that it is not possible even to walk quickly.  What I do against the stitch   Breathing through the nose Exhaling on the left/right foot, whichever is opposite to the stitch (this really helps, I did believe it at first) Slowing down when the side stitch sets in   The question   Are there exercises that explicitly help to prevent side stitches to occur? Does it get better, when I continue working out? Is it advisable to go to a doctor to check it out?  "
2200,What can I do to reduce the soreness after an excercise?,"I am a climber (currently doing mostly bouldering - short, powerful and very dynamic climbs) and I recently have issues with sore back muscles - I can barely move the next day after exercises and the following few days. What can I do about it other than making sure I warm up properly and stretch? Should I try any vitamins or other supplements? "
2201,How do I find the best Activity Tracker for my needs?,"N.B This is an attempt at a good shopping question.  Please provide feedback in the comments rather than voting to close straight away.  I've seen a lot of 'Top 10' lists, as well as amazon reviews, and I've looked over the questions in tracking and app, but I've yet to come across a useful website or tool for figuring out which Activity tracker is best suited to me?  The closest I've found is this one, but it lacks details like sleep tracking and other 'features' (app compatibility, HR monitor, VO2 etc.) I feel I'd want in an activity tracker.  Is there a tool like this? "
2202,What are good dumbbells or barbells for P90X?,"I'm looking to buy a barbell/dumbbell set to start doing P90X again. I came across the Bowflex and the Powerblock adjustable sets, but they just seem so freaking expensive ($300 to start for each).  Are there any that exist that are just as good for a lot cheaper? Or do any of you guys have any gripes about using the adjustable ones? "
2203,Lower back pain Deadlifts,"The other day I was doing deadlifts and as I started the movement (brought shins up to the bar) and did a legdrive movement, I felt a pain in my lower back. I immediately stopped and for the last two days, my lower back has been sore/hurt. I mean that I am still able to function and the pain is more of a dull one, but it hurts at times to stand up, and of course, bending over hurts too.   What should I do about this? I know something was probably wrong in that instant with my form (although I have practiced safe form for a long time and this is my first deadlift related injury!). It does feel better from yesterday but what else can I do to help with it? "
2204,Squats vs Stairs - Whats the difference?,Why is it that when I squat (400lbs) I can do all of my sets with no ill after effects. Even one legged squats (up to 200lbs) cause me no problems other than maybe DOMS.  When I climb stairs I find myself out of breath. I got on the stair machine last night at the gym and I was able to do it for about 2 minutes (1 min x 2) but at the 2 minute mark I was about to puke and I was winded.  Why? What's the difference between stairs and squats (or other leg exercises)? why do I feel like I'm going to puke and why am I out of breath on the stairs but not squatting. I started feeling bad probably 15-20 seconds into it. 
2205,Prevent wrist pain,Currently I'm working on several calisthenics exercises which put a lot of stress on my wrists (such as stradle planche to handstand). I already do warmups and stretches before I start doing worksets.  I've noticed that lately my wrists sometimes have this nagging pain outside of working out. I'm wondering if it's just soreness or an actual injury in an early stage.  Is there more I can do to prevent wrist pain from occurring? For example after my workout? Or during the day? 
2206,Calorie Counter from heart rate monitor Vs. Elliptical machine,"I used an elliptical machine at high intensity (not crazy high) for around 20 – 25 minutes, the elliptical machine workout said that I burned 600 calories where as the heart rate monitor said that I burned 330 calories. I did specify my weight in the elliptical machine but entered a lot more info (age, height, weight, normal heart rate etc..) on the heart rate monitor. Which one would be more accurate?    Edit Is it possible that the elliptical machine also takes into account the workout after-burn and that is why it is higher?  The heart rate monitor calorie counter keeps going up (faster than normal) even after I finish the workout, so eventually it might end up more or less the same as the elliptical machine calore counter (i.e. when the heart rate returns to normal)? "
2207,Good reasons to exercise,"I'm in high school.  I want to get better at gymnastics because I'm jealous of a kid in my class. So far I've made solid gymnastics-wise progress for ~5 weeks.   I wanted to run a 1500 in ~5 minutes becuase it was something most of my friends couldn't do. I joined the athletics club and got injured ~  Lots of people want to exercise to get bigger muscles, lose weight, six-pack abs popping, impress their friends, impress girls/boys, etc.  Something in me tells me this is stupid and unsustainable, that this is silly and will end badly. If these reasons weren't mine, I would laugh. It's really unglamorous when it's boiled down. Since I don't know how to phrase this, this voicing of insecurities, into a question, I will end with  thoughts, anyone? What's a good reason to want to exercise?  Ps. Please add good tags.  EDIT: What are some good motives to exercise. Looking big and beating your classmates, I know they are not good reasons. "
2208,Arch pain that won't go away,"I'm a long distance runner with very high arches. In the past, I've occasionally had arch pains, but they went away when I got good shoes and inserts.  A few months ago, I got new shoes and the arch pain came back. I've tried to fix it by getting another pair of shoes, high-quality running inserts, and putting athletic tape around my feet. The pain hasn't gone away, though. What else can I do?  I should say that I've only tried running with the new inserts, shoes, and tape once. Is it worth trying to run in them for a few times before giving up on them? "
2209,Are there movements that are always unsafe?,"Do I eliminate certain movement from my routine, no matter what? Right now, I raise a weight overhead, crunch with a weight, and do ballistic movements. I do not feel they harm me. Are these a recipe for injuries, even with proper form?  "
2210,Deadlift relatively low compared to squat. Where am I weak?,"My squat is currently 235 (see form check video) but my deadlift is suffering badly. Before I went on a 2 week vacation at work (where my gym is) I was pulling 225 with pretty good form but now I'm struggling to pull 185 without a little rounding (form check video of 185, form check video of 205).  Is it normal for a deadlift to lag behind the squat like this and what are some ways that I can improve deadlift strength capability? In what way would I be weak that would cause my deadlift to suffer? "
2211,Blurry vision after exercise?,"I've noticed that after I do some heavy cardio my vision will sometimes get blurry.  The blurriness usually occurs about 15-30 minutes after I exercise and then lasts for 15-30 minutes and is usually confined to one spot in my field of vision.  Has anyone else experienced this?  Should I be concerned or is this a common thing?  Update:  Type of cardio - pretty much anything (but not every time).  Typically bike riding, running or body pump class  Age - 30 Height - 6'5"" Weight - 200lbs  "
2212,Effect of High Muscle on 'Bands' of Body Fat,"When a person is highly muscular, does the accuracy of 'less than 17% Body Fat and you should be relatively healthy' change?  For example, it's possible for a person to be say 6'3 and 70kg or 6'3 and 110kg, and so saying 17% body fat would workout to a noticeably different actual masses of fat in the body. However, does the added muscle mean the fat is more 'spread around', or should men aim to always have no more than say 13.6kg of Fat in their Body (17% of the Average Weight for Men of ~80kg)? "
2213,"I run 7 miles in an hour, how can i make it 10 miles in an hour?","I go running twice a week, 7 miles each time and it takes exactly an hour. I have kept this routine for a while (like 5 months). I was expecting that by time I would get faster but it seems I am not improving at all.  How can I improve my speed? Should I for example run more frequently or run longer each time? "
2214,How much protein and how often should I consume if my LBM is very low?,"I've been googling for hours and I'm still not sure how to resolve this situation.  Defining the problem   many articles on the web are written for heavy people with relatively high body fat percentage the articles are inconclusive on how much protein should a person consume per 1 meal the amount of protein per 1 meal times number of meals doesn't equal the recommended value for low LBM people   Putting down the exact values   my exact total body weight is 63 kg (134 lbs) my body fat percentage is around 6% my lean body mass (LBS) is 57 kg (126 lbs)   The photo of me with the values stated above, provided for better understanding of the situation:  [website]What I do and what this question is and isn't about   I lift weights 5 times a week In this question, I want to discuss protein and protein only. The consumption of carbohydrates and/or fats should be completely irrelevant to this thread I do not want to gain fat   The recommended rules  The recommended rule no. 1:     ""One needs to consume 20 grams of protein per one meal for the body to start repairing muscle tissue.""   The recommended rule no. 2:     One needs to consume 25 grams of protein per one meal for the body to start repairing muscle tissue.""   The recommended rule no 3:     ""Do not consume more than 30 grams of protein per one meal, as the body cannot make use of more and will store the rest into fat.   The recommended rule no. 4:     ""The total amount of protein consumed per day should be 2 times your body weight in kg."" (this number varies)   The recommended rule no. 5:     ""Eat at least 6 meals a day.""   The problem arising from the rules above  Let's say that consuming 20 grams of protein per 1 meal is enough. If we multiply it by 6 meals a day, that makes it 120 grams of protein per day, which is only a bit more than what one of the rules say: 2 times 57 (LMS in kg) = 114 grams of protein per day.  However, if the rule about consuming 20 grams of protein per 1 meal is wrong and it should be 25 grams per 1 meal, it would make it 25 x 6 = 150 grams of protein per day, which is a lot more what I should consume. If the rule is correct at all, right?  So is the rule correct? Should I consume only 114 grams of protein per day? That seems like quite a low number to me.  Could someone shed a light on this once and for all? "
2215,What is the etiquette for sharing a power rack?,"My gym has a set of three racks in a corner: one squat rack sandwiched between two power racks. Both of the power racks have their platform continue behind the back of the rack itself, allowing two people to use the rack simultaneously. I have seen people using them that way, but they usually know each other and are working together.   The last time I was at the gym, I was doing static lunges with a 45 pound bar in one of these power racks. A guy walked up to the other bar sitting on the platform behind me, said nothing to me, and started preparing to lift it. I asked him not to. It came out a little harshly, because I was a little annoyed about something else. The guy working next to me chastised me for this, saying something to the effect of, ""We share here."" I said I would be done in less than five minutes (I had one set left, so it was actually about 2 minutes), and they left it at that.  I am very much a beginning lifter, and I am not very confident of my form. So I feel uncomfortable with someone working that closely behind me unless I know them and trust them. But it seems like I might have broken some etiquette rule I don't know about. Am I being paranoid here about safety? Or was my request reasonable? "
2216,No carbs before sleep. But how long before?,"Facts   You need carbs (preferebaly fast absorbing type) after a full on gym session to fuel the muscle and stop the body from losing muscle. It's always recomended not to take carbs before sleep. (I am gonna assume to maximise the  fat-loss process) You need at least 8hrs, and recomneded up to 10 hours (for pro bodybuilders with intense training) of good sleep to recover and balance out the hormones.   Scenario  So if you're a person who goes to gym after finishing from work and possibly finishing the gym session by 9 or even later and need to be in bed by 10:30 to be able to have the minimum amount of recomended sleep, this feeding time can be extrememly complicated.  Since I think lots of people fall into this catagory I felt the need to verify following facts in more details:  Questions   How long of the rest period you need to give for the food with high carbs content to digest? How long before sleep you should consider not taking foods with high carbs content? In the instance of finishing the workout and being required to go to bed straight away, what to do not to deprive the body over-night (from carbs point of view. I don't want to touch on the Casein protein topic) and stop the muscle loss?  "
2217,"Alternatives to CTL, ATL and TRIMP for running?","I'm an avid runner and like so many other runners, I like to get a measurement or number for my current fitness. I use the measurements for two purposes: to see how the different types of exercises affects the fitness and to see how much I can challenge myself for a specific race.  But how exactly can I measure fitness?  For the last 4 years, I have used SportTracks and in particular the Training Load plugin to calculate CTL, ATL and Training Stress Balance and have used these numbers as a measurement for my current fitness.  Historically, these numbers comes from work by Dr. Coggan and others (as described in this article by Hunter Allen) for use by cyclists and was later adapted for use by runners. Originally, CTL and ATL was based on a power meter (TSS - Training Stress Score), but for runners the concept of TRIMP (TRaining IMPulse) was used instead as it is rather difficult to directly measure the power used by a runner. As TRIMP is based on a simple accumulation of your heart-rate over the course of the run, it makes good sense as an alternative to TSS.  But... I curious, and I wonder whether there are other similar (well-founded) numbers that can be used to calculate your fitness?  I forgot: One such number is rTSS (running TSS) by Dr. Steve Macgregor, but it seems to be nearly impossibly to use for your daily runs as it requires many subjective numbers... "
2218,Just found a hemorrhoid. Should I lift this friday?,"I'm 23 and god only knows how this could've happened. It could either be from the other day when I got trigger happy and evacuated my bowels quickly(I wasn't bearing down hard I just push it all out relatively quickly and with ease)or from squatting and deadlifting. I've been doing stronglifts 5x5 for a few months and had some trouble making gains until I really started to push myself.  I'm afraid that the extra exertion I've been putting into my lifts has played a role in the formation of this. But should I continue to lift tomorrow? I want to say that I put a lot of pressure in my ass as I exert the force on the squat, because everyone always says to squeeze your glutes. Could that have been the cause?  My lifting stats really aren't even that high:  OHP: 100 Squat: 225 DL: 225 BP: 180 Rows: 100 "
2219,"Got in shape, lost fat & gained muscle, but I'm weaker now. Why?","I decided to finally get in proper shape, and after lots of struggle, I managed it quite well. I lost 30+ pounds of needless fat, and gained several pounds of muscle throughout a few months of serious workouts. I went from not being able to run 0.5 miles to running nearly a 5K now. The caveat?  I am much weaker now than before. I have more muscle than I did when I was obese, but I have less strength. For example, I weighed around 200 lbs. and could deadlift 315 + lbs. without even barely exercising. I could also do chin ups and even climb ropes with just my upper-body -- no legs needed.  I dropped down to 150 lbs., and built up to 165 lbs. with a good portion of that being muscle weight. My arms are bigger and more defined than they were when I was 30 + lbs. more, but now I can barely do chin ups and can only climb a rope the same as when I carried all of that extra fat. I find this pretty disappointing since it's like I traded in strength for better looks. I have been doing mostly strength training, but some hypertrophy too. I do all of the same exercises as then, but I just seem much weaker comparatively. My arms at 200 lbs. were 13 -- not at 165 lbs. they are 15 inches almost.  Why the hell would I not be any stronger if I was pretty much just fatter? Literally I would flex and have almost no muscle, and smaller arms when I was obese -- but I was just purely stronger naturally.  After getting down to like 13% bodyfat and bulking for 4-6 months I gained considerable muscle mass with nearly no bodyfat change, but now I'm weaker -- can't barely lift my own weight nor other weight.  It's as if being simply a fatass made me stronger without having to do much of any exercise. When I was obese I simply ate nothing but garbage/junk food and didn't even get 80 grams of protein a day -- now I eat extremely well and get proper protein, fats, and carbs. Basically, I cleaned up my diet, got the results I wanted, but the strength was traded in for it. When I was obese I would not even have a workout regimen -- I just rarely worked out -- maybe once a week or every 2 weeks. Now I do 2-3 times a week and vary workouts. I even had a trainer for a while and they said that fat helped with leverage and extreme energy surplus manifested itself as large bouts of power concentrated output -- or something like that. They called it ""fat strength,"" but said ""fit strength"" is better.  Any thoughts? Is it just simply that I was fatter, I was stronger? As stated, I ate nothing but junk/garbage all day, and didn't get any healthy protein/etc. -- mostly all just 3,000+K calories of carbs, with high sat. fats and low protein (I didn't really eat much if any meat back then).  I don't have any illnesses/diseases, and I don't feel weak per se -- just weaker than when I was fat.  It interests me because I was fat but:  1.Had a garbage diet with low protein.  2.Barely exercised and did zero cardio.  3.Sat most of the day and didn't do much of any hypertrophy/strength training really. "
2220,"What can I do to improve my eating and exercise habits, in order to be more healthy?","At the present moment, I am 5'8"", 17, and weigh 210 pounds.  At the beginning of the summer, or maybe a little before, I started to pay more attention to what I ate and how I exercised. Though, it is a month now, and I still don't feel like I'm doing enough. I did this in the hopes to lose weight (I am sorry if this is a stereotype of a question), and also, because I generally don't feel good. I went to get a physical last week, and my doctor pointed out I need to lose weight, which made me question if I was doing enough.   I always feel fatigued and tired. I believe some of it has to do with depression and boredom, but, I believe a good amount of it may be with what I eat. Everyday, for breakfast, I eat a bowl of cheerios, and skim milk;  or I make an  three - egg - omelette, and put two slices of ham, and two slices of cheese in the eggs. I also add a little milk in the egg, before it is cooked, to change the texture. After whatever I eat, I have a protein shake, it contains 30g of protein. I work under the assumption I need 70 a day.   I do have a bad habit of eating whatever snack food I can find in the morning, before I cook breakfast.   For lunch, I usually eat a sandwich. The sandwich will consist of two slices of wheat bread, two slices of ham, two slices of cheese, mayonnaise, and I put a small pack of chips in the sandwich as well. If I do not eat that, I usually have yogurt. If I do not have either, I usually don't eat. Many times, even after eating lunch, I'm still very hungry, and don't feel too good. My head and my stomach hurt a lot. I don't know why.    For dinner, I eat whatever my mom cooks for me. She cooks either sphahetti, chicken, steak, pork chops, hamburgers, tacos, or macaroni and cheese (which consists of Velveeta cheese. I understand these things generally are not good for me. However, my mom isn't into cooking, and those are my options, when she cooks.  If she is not home, I have to cook. I eat whatever I can find. Sometimes, I eat another sandwich, sometimes I cook one of the aforementioned foods, sometimes I order food, though not often, and sometimes I don't eat. It depends on circumstance. After dinner, I have another protein shake.   At times, I snack on things as well, though, mostly, I believe it is because I'm bored. I try to eat whatever fruit we have, we have grapes, mangos, and kiwis currently. There are also cashews and granola bars. On the other hand, there are chips (In my kitchen, the chips are currently the Ruffles Cheddar and Sour Cream) and M &amp; Ms. If I'm sitting in my house for a long time, I usually go to eat some, and then return to whatever I was doing. we used to have cookies as well (when we go grocery shopping, I get one thing that I consider as desert).   The only thing I drink is water. There usually aren't other drinks at my house. We have two 50 oz glasses, that I fill with ice water, and I drink them whenever I'm thirsty throughout the day. I don't keep track of how much water I take in.    As for exercise, I try to walk outside every day. If it's nice out, I try to walk two times around my neighborhood or I go to the park, sit down for a bit, and walk back. I also walk to church, there and back, which is about half an hour, every week. Sometimes, when I don't have lunch, I will walk to the store. It will take an hour or more. I ride my bike as well, but it doesn't seem like an exercise to me, since I don't pedal constantly. I ride around the track at my local college, 5 times, every few weeks. I believe it is one mile, but I'm not sure. Walking and riding my bike are my means of transportation.   Also, I run every two or 3 days. I jog for 10 minutes, in my house, and then I run fast for 15, I take a small break, and then run fast for another 15.  I used to run fast for 30 minutes altogether, in one unit, but one time, I fell  to the ground halfway (though, I'm not opposed to doing that again, if need be). I play music when I run, and check my heartbeat after every song. If it 200 bpm or higher, then I say I have done a sufficient job. If it is lower, I say I haven't. I run every 2 or 3 days. I do not do any exercises, which are focused on building muscle.   I hope I have accounted enough of my diet and exercise habits, for them to be able to go under correction. What should I do different? What should I eat, instead; and, how can I improve my exercise habits? What else can I do? Where can I learn? Thank you.  "
2221,Tennis is good to lose weight?,"I've heard that tennis is not a good sport to lose weight, that someone who plays tennis just loses sugar in the blood. Is it maybe because the style of this sport, that we don't need endurance to play it? For instance, in running we need to have a kind of a constant speed, in tennis we don't have a balanced physical exertion because most of the time we sprint.  Is that true?  Thanks in advance. "
2222,Which activities are OK during resting days?,I am currently going to the gym 3 times a week doing 2 alternating workouts. I am 31 years old and in a healthy condition.  During some weeks I feel the need to do more. I am sitting at home during the days I should spend resting but I have too much energy left and need to get out. This week I went to the gym a 4th time and I really enjoyed it.  I know that missing out on resting time is bad for muscle growth. That's why I wonder how I should deal with this situation. Is it OK to mix in extra sessions now and then or should I stick to my schedule no matter what? Should I rather do some extra cardio on rest days instead of an extra session weight lifting? Or are there muscles that are more tolerable than others? For example would it be OK to train my stomach muscles more often but not my biceps? 
2223,The best workout for defining muscles,"I would like to know how can I achieve defined muscles. I am not really after gaining tons of muscles, instead I'd like to be somehow like this guy, having my muscles defined. Can you please tell me a good workout plan for achieving this? Can this be achieved with compound movements? I heard that a good strategy would be to perform exercises with lighter weights than usual, but in many reps? Should I first build mass and then define it?  I have been going to the gym for around 2 months now. Since starting, I focused on compound exercises (deadlifts, squats etc), as I've read they are better for your health and also for building bigger mass. I heard they are also good for starters.  I am 1.79m tall (5.87ft) and weigh 73kg (161p), so you can probably imagine I'm not fat but a bit skinny actually (although I do have a bit of belly fat :D)  Thank you very much! "
2224,Glutamine to increase muscle mass through better recovery,"My main goal is to increase muscle mass through strength / heavy lifting. I am considering taking a Glutamine supplement and was wondering if doing so will result in quicker and more complete recovery which may yield better muscle growth?  In other words, do I risk not getting the most out of my workouts in terms of gains due to having only one days rest between workouts and not allowing my body sufficient time to recover? If yes, will taking a glutamine supplement help reduce the effects of this problem and allow a more complete recovery with better gains?  Not sure it makes a difference, but I am currently on a creatine supplement which seems to work great.  "
2225,Standing up suddenly causes tunnel vision?,"Occasionally, when I stand up after laying flat on a bed or couch I will take a few steps and then start to have tunnel/ darkened vision, a slight headache, and sometimes lose some balance, once falling down and only keeping from hitting the ground by instinct, and then I forgot how I had left my bed for a few seconds.  While I am not to worried about this, I would like to know what might be causing this, so I can try to avoid a more serious accident. Could dehydration cause this? I have some friends who report similar experiences but others deny having them. Are some people more inclined to dizziness from this? I don't think it is from exertion or anything, as I am resonably get and recently completed a weeklong backpacking trip, although it is not something I usually do. "
2226,What are the optimum foods and supplements for beginning runners?,"I plan to start a running routine using the program listed here to improve my overall fitness.  What foods and – if applicable – supplements would be recommended for beginning runners? I.e. a ""beginning runner's diet"" program if possible, including what to eat when, and in what proportion.  My current daily diet is generally:  For breakfast: mostly Corn Flakes + milk; Lunch: mostly Roti, fried fish, and assorted vegetables; Dinner: -same as lunch-      Update:     Diet for Beginning Runners      by MelissaW, eHow Contributor        To get the most out of your running, it is important to eat right. If you're a new runner with a running schedule, it's best to match your eating habits with your running schedule. You can do this by eating smaller meals on those days, eating protein-rich foods, eating the right carbohydrates and drinking lots of water.        Eat Smaller Meals   The best way to start a diet for new runners is to learn to eat smaller meals a few times throughout the day. That way you won't feel too full when it's time to run, yet you'll have the energy you need. Think of eating snacks throughout the day like celery and peanut butter, yogurt with granola and oatmeal with fruit.     List (snacks): celery, peanut butter, yogurt with granola and oatmeal with fruit    My choice: crackers with peanut butter       Carbohydrates   Carbohydrates are your friend when it comes to running. But, it's important to decide between healthy carbohydrates and the not so healthy ones. For healthy carbohydrates, stick with apples, bananas and carrots. Also try brown rice, oatmeal and lentil beans for healthy carbohydrates that will give you energy.     List: apples, bananas, carrots; brown rice, oatmeal and lentil beans       Protein   Protein is what helps make you feel fuller longer. That way you won't get any hunger pangs when you start on your new running schedule. Protein is also great because you usually have a feeling of fullness while eating a lot less calories. The best proteins for beginner runners include lean chicken and beef, fish, like salmon, and canned water-packed tuna.     List: lean chicken and beef, fish (e.g. salmon, canned water-packed tuna)       Drink Water   Like any plan to better your health, you'll want to drink at least eight oz. of water a day [my emphasis] when you start running. This will help give you energy, keep you hydrated and cleanse your body of any toxins. But, make sure not to drink too much water too fast before or after you begin running. This could give you stomach cramps or make you feel nauseous.    (Ref: [website]My new diet:    Morning: Corn Flakes + diluted milk; two bananas  Lunch: Roti, chicken / fish, lentils, (additionally?: banana? if helpful)  Dinner: -same as above- (plus banana?)  Would this be a good diet program? "
2227,Burn fat and gain muscles at same time,"I am doing weights for a few months now, but I find it hard to gain muscles and burn fat at the same time. It seems like one goes at the expense of the other. I think I have a balanced diet, with more proteins than before (whey isolate), and little fat. At the same time, I think I need more carbs than before, to grow muscles. For sure I don't want to be hungry, as my body will burn muscles then, right? I also do cardio exercises to burn fat, but when I do it the day after a weights workout, the muscles hurt more than otherwise. Is this a bad idea, and do I just destroy muscle tissue that way? Or am I doing it all right and am I just being impatient?  My core question is how best to combine gaining muscles and burning fat. I am aware that the question has been asked before, but I want to know precisely how one affects the other.  How can I minimize muscle loss when losing fat by energy deficit or doing cardio exercise and how can I minimize fat gain when I try to gain muscles with workouts accompanied with proteins and energy?  Just for clarification, when I say ""burn fat"", I don't necessarily mean ""lose weight"". Just get a lower fat percentage. "
2228,Should I continue taking creatine when on a long break from training?,"I am on a plant-based diet and take 5g of creatine monohydrate every morning to compensate for the lack of its natural consumption. I work out 4-5 days a week, but now I am going on a vacation soon for 8 days, which means that there will be about 10 days without training. Should I be taking creatine during that period to ""maintain the load""? Or is it unnecessary? "
2229,How can I fix my 'computer body'?,"I have spent so many years at the computer.  I work out and run so I am toned.  Weights once a week (deadlift, squats, just started shrugs).  I run 1-3 times a week, 3 miles.  Three times a week I do either planks or pull-ups (hand forward), three times a week I do glute bridges (for anterior pelvic tilt) and push ups.  On the days I work out I do conditioning: various stretches, psoas with a tennis ball, cobra, stretching hip flexors, etc.  Despite all this, I still have a 'geek body'.  My anterior pelvic tilt, resulting in its pushing my butt and stomach out, as well as snapping in my hip flexors when I do sit ups for flutter kicks, isn't going away.  My shoulders seem to go forward too much, and if I roll my shoulders back to loosen them up, they click a lot.  My scapula go out a bit too much, with the right one going out much further, though that's probably due to a very mild scoliosis on that side.  My elbows click.  The backs of my hands face forward.  My bicep femoris muscles in the legs are very tight, and begin to hurt if I walk all day; I try to massage them with 'the stick' a couple of times a week.  What can I do?  The above exercises haven't done much for me.  Even in the old days, when people were so active and healthy, they didn't move 16 hours a day.  Why isn't my frequent breaks througout the day, workout schedule 3 times a week, and getting out and about a couple of times a day fixing this?  Edit  When I squat I go to around parallel.  My heels stay on the ground.  I squat between 180 and 200 lbs.  I squat normally once a week. "
2230,"How do (pro) hockey players weigh so much, but look so small?","I've attended many NHL games, and a friend of mine has a cousin who is married to a pro hockey player, although he plays for European teams (not NHL). Anyways, we hang sometimes, and I notice he's a skinny-ish looking guy with a little muscle, but he weighs close to 200 lbs.!  He is not too tall -- maybe 5'11"" or 6' -- and has a barrel chest with thin arms and large quads. I am around the same size and have built arms and a more overall muscular frame, and I'm 174 lbs.!  Where is he hiding those extra 20+ lbs. if he's neither much fatter, taller, nor more muscular?  Seriously, I've flexed and seen him flex and his arms are maybe 14"" and he has not much muscle -- mostly just a big chest and quads -- but is pretty skinny everywhere else.  He weighed in at around 197 lbs. for his team weigh in a few months back, I believe. I can even show you a picture of him and how narrow he looks. Is this some kind of inside secret?    As you can see he's not a buff guy -- a little build, but nothing too serious. He's not too strong either.  He also has a flat stomach (no abs), but just overall looks like a skinny guy.  If I bulked to that size I'd look fat! Or I'd be need to be twice as muscular.  I mean I'm a hockey player (not pro), but I can't fathom where he keeps that extra weight. "
2231,How does solubility of whey protein correlate to its effectiveness?,"I ran across a post by Julia Vins, a powerlifter, comparing two brands of whey protein powder.     The original text is in Russian:     Решила сегодня сравнить whey gold standard от optimum nutrition и whey   protein от pureprotein банальным способом - залив кипятком. Этот метод   указывает на отсутствие или наоборот присутствие белка. Для большей   убедительности взяла даже одинаковые вкусы :) Pureprotein: растворился   в горячей воде даже лучше, чем в холодной. Меня это немного удивило,   и, начитавшись информации о подобных тестах, я решила его сварить. Но,   увы, и этот тест меня разочаровал. Растворился всё также идеально, и в   течении пяти минут варки так и не свернулся в комочки.  Whey gold:   совсем другая ситуация, свернулся практически полностью после   добавления кипятка. При варке образовал плотные сгустки.  Я думаю,   комментарии тут излишни. Цена соответствует качеству, как и должно   быть :)   The Google translation:     I decided today to compare whey gold standard of optimum nutrition and   whey protein from pureprotein banal way - Gulf of boiling water. This   method indicates the absence or presence of the protein contrary. For   more convincing, even took the same tastes :) Pureprotein: soluble in   hot water, even better than in cold. I was a little surprised by this,   and, having read the information about these tests, I decided to cook   it. But, alas, this test has disappointed me. The solution is also   perfect everything, and within five minutes of cooking never curled   into lumps. Whey gold: a completely different situation, curled up   almost completely after the addition of boiling water. When cooking   has formed dense clumps. I think that comment is superfluous. The   price matches the quality, as it should be :)   Google tends to botch Russian translations, so I'm trying to make sense of Julia's point. In the last sentence, she's concluding that ""you get what you pay for"". Optimum Gold Standard is more expensive than PureProtein by an average of 20 cents per ounce. Thus, in her eyes, Optimum is the higher quality protein. And since the only difference is that Optimum doesn't dissolve well in cold water and even curdles in hot water, then insolubility is proportional to quality of the protein. I understand her experiment, but not the premise. How does solubility of whey protein correlate to its effectiveness? "

2233,How do I find a physically intensive activity without triggering negative thought patterns?,"I have avoided most forms of exercise nearly my whole life, including sports. I try to get myself to go for a jog but it just stirs up all sorts of negative thoughts (all kinds of anger and cynicism about the world, not just my self image); I go to the gym, and though I love lifting weights, I have the same problem of negative thoughts. The only kind of physical activity I consistently appreciate is trail hiking, but the fact is that for me and most people, trail hiking is inconvenient and inaccessible.  What can I do to find a physically intensive activity that will not trigger picky hangups or mental anguishes? Is there a trial-and-error process that I can follow that will help find discover an exercise routine for my situation? "
2234,Wholegrains considered as slow digesting carbs?,"For the person who is doing a resistance training with a spot on diet with all the meals weighed and protein and Carb proportions balanced, can grains be the main source of complex carbs, if weight loss is the goal?   I always noticed the recommend complex carbs for people in this situation are brown rice, pumpkin, sweet potato and similar foods. However I've came across this paragraph in one my readings which says  ""The current Paleo craze has demonized grains, which isn’t fair, or rooted in solid science. Still, most people get and stay leaner when they limit their intake. This is partly due to grains being readily available and easy to overeat. A wise move is to save your grains for just one meal a day, either at breakfast, in the hours before or after you lift weights, or as part of your last meal of the day.""  Does this mean grains such as wholemeal bread can be problematic and hindering the weight loss process if used as the main carbohydrates source in the daily diet?  "
2235,"Taking supplements - Glutamine, brown rice protein, creatine","It's my first time taking supplements...because I need to add more muscle mass. I do a lot of olympic weightlifting, so I squat(front &amp; back) everyday, lots of static holds (around 200kg) - snatches, clean and jerk etc... I am training them everyday...but I have found recovery to be hard so far. So I read about glutamine, creatine and the brown rice protein and got some.  My question about taking them is, they all say I should take them after or before my workout, is it right to take one after the other?or taking one of each on the same day? surely it can be good for you... "
2236,Feeling squats in my right leg more,"A recent development has occurred in my squats.  I seem to be feeling the squats work out my right leg significantly more than my left leg.  As far as I can tell my stance is square and I should be using both legs evenly.  It also doesn't make sense since I'm sure my right leg is strong than my left, but I may be wrong.  What could cause a squat to work one side more than the other?  What should i look for in my form? "

2238,Physical Activity and METS,"Suppose a person performs 3 horus of cardio at 9 METS. To obtain the same metabolic changes without exercise, would this require that the person wait 27 hours? Assume that the person's daily activity is at 1 MET.   In other words, to get the same metabolic changes as 3 hours of cardio at 9 METS, would the person who did no exercise have to wait 27 hours? "
2239,Burning biceps productive?,"Yesterday I worked out with 10lb dumbbells and now I feel that burning sensation in my arms. I have heard that this means it's time to get heavier weights. I do reps of 60 to feel the burn, and I believe this is a waste of time.   What weight should I use and how many repetitions and sets should I do? What does the burning mean, and how should I feel when I do the workout correctly with dumbbells of the correct weight?  "
2240,If StrongLifts takes longer should you reduce volume?,"I'm aware of what the report says but was advised to post the question. I am also interested in the responses more so that I can figure out how to proceed with my own gains.  One of the main draws I had to SL 5x5 was the 45 minute workout time, but now since things are getting a little tough, the rest time between heavy(relatively)sets is really drawing out the length of the workout to 1.5 hours easily. I was just advised recently by Dave Liepmann that this was normal and he also said that he changes the programming when this occurs.  I'm wondering if it's ""time"" to switch to SL 3x5 even though my lifts aren't THAT high?  For reference:   Squat: 230 DL: 175 Bench: 185 OHP: 110 Rows: 110   I would like to alter the programming so I can get in and out but I'm not sure I'm at the ""level"" to be doing SL 3x5 yet? Or could I be wrong? If it's not necessary I'm willing to continue putting in the long hour at the gym.  See, as far as rest times are concerned I typically don't need 5 minutes until my 4th or 5th squat, and the OHP has been incredibly hard. One day I'll pump out the sets easily and then when I go to increase the weight, the 5lb minimal increase will be extremely challenging in comparison. I'll try 2-3 minute rests but sometimes I feel that even that isn't enough.   On a typical squat for me I'll do final warmup-2-min-Set1-2min-Set2-3min-Set3-4min-Set4-5min-Set5.  "

Now, after few years, I am once again trying to re-start my gym work outs. Based on my earlier experience, I have noticed that calf muscles, fore arm strength effect almost every workout. So I want to be better prepared this time.  I am regularly doing stretching exercises, push ups (for chest &amp; biceps), Chair Dips (for triceps), squats (for thighs).  So, my question is What is correct way to prepare your body for gym workouts in terms of exercises and time?   Added:     As per the question of what I am trying to achieve? I am trying to   gain some weights, then after I get the desired mass, I am planning on   concentrating on strength.  "

2243,Does a high proteine intake support the reduction of body fat?,"The following scenario:  Male, 180cm tall, 80kg wants to lower body fat. Sits most of the time in front of a pc Wants to lose fat before building muscles  Started to workouts: 3 days a week weight lifting for 45min, then 45min cardio every other day 45 min cardio  Now I've read having a high protein intake of 2-2,5g per kg weight would protect the muscles from being used as protein source and the high intake of protein would increase metabloism to support reducing body fat.  Of course the protein being just an addition to a healthy diet.  Are those two statements true and does the high protein intake help to protect the muscles/help reducing fat?  Then supplementing protein shakes are a quick source of energy, approx. 100 kcal per 30g saving.  Does it matter when you take it? Would it be bad to take it right before/after a regular meal and could it happen that the body has so much energy that he converts the meal into fat because of the protein shake?   How much time should be between meals and a protein shake? "
2244,why no muscle pain after fitness?,"I just started doing weightlifting. The first time I had quite a lot muscle pain, however I just purchased some dumbells and started to work out with these. I did bicep curls,hammer curl, bench concentration curls and zottman curls and tricep dips to work out my arms. My biceps were really exhausted (wasn't able to get the weight up anymore after I finished). The next day I was suprised that I had no muscle pain at all. So this raised a question:   I KNOW that muscle pain is not linked to muscle growth, however when having muscle pain it is hard to lift some weight the next day (which kind off tells me that they were charged good last workout) So it's quite counter intuitive to me that no muscle pain is ""good"" because without the muscle pain I can workout fine the next day. So I'm interseted in what causes it that I don't have muscle pain after a training which really exhausted my muscles?   (P.s I have already read some topics about no muscle pain and intensive training: 1, 2, however they all say: ""it's not related"" however I'm interested why this is the case) "
2245,Heavy Weights Then Nap?,"I am on a routine of heavy weights, full body circuit training.  When I am done, I am obviously tired, but sometimes I feel like actually taking a nap.  Are there any ill effects to taking a rest after a heavy weight workout?  ( or any weight training regimine? )    I have always thought you should stay active for a bit after a workout... "
2246,Does afternoon napping help?,I have trouble sleeping at night and usually get 5-6 hours max.  I lift 3x's a week and do cardio 2-3 times a week (including heavy bag work). Does afternoon napping help  with recovery? How does it affect fat burning? I read somewhere that enough sleep is a factor in weight loss.

2248,Legs training program,"I'm male 90kg 172cm. I've been going to gym for about 3 weeks. It seems like my legs are weak compared to upper body. For example I could hardly do 4x15 squats with 40/45kg during 1/2 week, while I bench press about 70/75kg. (from my observations all people in the gym squat more then bench press) A friend of mine says I should increase the weight for squats and reduce reps for time being. What's the logic behind this advice? Is it better to slowly increase the weight keeping current sets and reps? "

2252,Should I change my workout as I get closer to a 5k (or any other short-term goal) when I have a routine that's helping me meet my long-term goals?,"I've been working out with the goal of weight loss for about a month and a half now (after falling apart due to circumstances beyond my control for a couple of months) and specifically my first 5k for about 3 weeks, and I have about 2 months left before the race, so I'm looking at longer term preparation.  Right now, I do some kind of structured exercise every day:  Three days a week (Monday, Wednesday, Friday), I run, currently on a treadmill due to the weather. When it's warmer and the weather isn't bad, I do tend to run outside. My runs are typically for ~30 minutes, with a ~5 minute cooldown period of light jogging transitioning into walking. In each running session (the 30 minute block), I always cover at least a 5k, more recently getting consistently into the 3.3-3.5 mile distance. My current comfortable pace for a 5k distance is about 9:50/mile, but I've gotten to 8:30/mile if I push myself.  Two days a week (Tuesday, Thursday), I use an elliptical on high resistance for 15 minutes and then do light weight lifting (biceps curls, chest press, triceps curls, lat pulldown, crunches, shoulder press) for 3 sets of 10 each, adjusting weight as necessary.  On weekends, I walk (on a treadmill, incline of 9-15 randomized for 30 seconds at a level) for 30 minutes.  So far, this has been working out really well for me. I've taken almost two minutes off my 5k time and lost something like 18lbs since mid-December. However, I'm wondering if I should change things up as I get closer to my 5k in order to focus on that particular goal and then switch back to this more generic workout after the race. Perhaps two months out is still too early to change, so my question is three-fold:   Should I make changes my exercise to meet a short-term goal, especially when I have a routine that's working well for my long-term goals? Right now, that goal is a 5k. But I'm also thinking for other things as well (such as other 5ks or a potential future 10k a year from this summer). If I should change, when should I change? Should it be a change sooner or closer to the race day? If I should change, what should my routine look like in the weeks and days leading up to the 5k?  "
2253,Regaining lost strength and muscles,"I have always been strong, broad shouldered and musculus, mostly genetic I think.  Though now in my forties, I have less mass than a few years ago.  If I want to regain, can or should I train differently than somebody trying to gain ""new"" strength and mass?  Especially, can I progress with more reps pr set, less sets or working less hard? (further from failure)?   (I understand regain in generally easy, because you still have the cells/nucli, though what I have read is mostly about young athletes and bodybuilders losing strength and mass over a short time) "
2254,What is the most effective and least time-consuming structured post-running (and post cooldown) stretching routine?,"I've been following Tim Noakes' running program for approximately a week-and-half now: nice program. But I have a major quibble-cum-problem / issue: my post-running stretching routine. ... It's HORRIBLE!  - I would like to spend the least amount of time to achieve the most effective stretching outcome. -  Can anyone [viz. ""experienced runners""[1]] suggest a routine which they use - and, especially, find to be the most effective and time-saving[2]? (If applicable, among the ones they've tried / used?)  Would be greatly and genuinely appreciative.

"
2255,Some questions about the deadlift,"I have been deadlifting for about a month or so. Just today, I did 6 sets of deadlifts, with the last set at 60kg (132.27lbs) at 5 reps. There is a video recording of me on this last set here.  Upon viewing the video, I noticed that there is a slight rounding in my upper back. In particular, I was told that this rounding was caused by my shoulders being slightly internally rotated during the movement, and not keeping my chest up.          Question 1: Is this a serious cause for concern?      Given that the deadlift is such a complex movement, I often have trouble keeping track of all the things to do. One issue in particular that bothers me is the following:          Question 2: How do I really ""power up"" with my quads from the bottom?       It seems to me that my quads only really kick into action a little bit off the floor. Perhaps the start position of my butt (at the beginning of the video) is too low? I am tall and have rather long limbs.  Finally, any comments on my deadlift form from the video would be appreciated. "
2256,"As a beginner, should I incorporate polarized training instead of HIIT or endurance as this study says?","I'm a new triathlete, most in sprint distances. I go about 5 hours a week of training right now (im not that good yet) and will go more over the next year.  I read a study a friend gave to me ([website]it also says that they are really well trained guys, so would that make a difference for me as a beginner? Which type of training would produce better results? "

2258,Running after night shift?,"I am working the night shift and I usually go for a run after that at about 6 'o'clock in the morning. I don't feel fresh because of the whole night stretch.  But the problem is I desperately want to remove my belly fat and other extra fats so I force myself to run.   My question is: if I only have that time available and I want to reduce the fat in 1 month is it advisable to exercise this way? If this isn't healthy, what should I do instead?   Also I have seen many people running for years but still having a lot of fat, which makes me depressed.  So what is the correct way of exercising or any diet so that I can remove my fat in one month. "

Which proteins would be helpful in gaining weight?  What other foods need to be eaten in what proportion to gain weight?  I am 5 foot 5 inches tall and I weigh 50 KG. "
2260,How to make a flat stomach within a month,This is my 1st question in this site.I work in an IT company and as you all know no physical work at all.I sit almost 11-12 hours a day and hence my stomach has been grown up similar like the image given.

2261,How boiled eggs can help in weight loss?,"I have not joined the gym for exercise but only walk of 30 to 45 minutes before my breakfast and after the dinner. In breakfast i take a cup of tea with a slice of brown bread, and in lunch a small bowl of salad and some chicken or fish, in dinner i eat Chapati with some vegetable dish. Do I need eggs too for weight loss? Should i add/remove some foods to lose weight? How boiled eggs can help me in weight loss and what should be the quantity and timings like, in breakfast, lunch etc. or any time(when i want)? "
2262,I can't perform a single pull-up,"I can't perform a single pull-up, or even a chin-up. I can't lift myself to the bar, however when using a low bar (one that I can start from the top) I can perform 3-4 chin-ups but still no pull-ups. What's the matter with me? How can I fix this? "
2263,"What is the effect of abs workout, without diet and cardio?","Think of a person who is not interested in bodybuilding and fitness.  Let's say that he didn't change anything in his life style (still no fitness, no diet, no cardio) but only started to do abs workout regularly. What will be the results, can you achieve a visible six pack ? What is the visible changes ?  Edit: After 2 answers recieved, I want to make my point more clear-> I need to know if abs workout alone helps fat burning?, is it possible to burn all the fat by just abs.  "
2264,Training for the 40 yard dash,"I'm trying to do some fairly simple training to get more in shape for a local informal football league, and from what I have read, the 40 yard dash is a good routine to practice to help improve both speed and stamina. With that background, my question is:   Is there a ""proper"" way to train for the 40? Right now I just do some simple warm-up (a few quick sprints), run the dash as many times as I can in a row with a very minimal break (btw 15 and 60 seconds) between each run, and then a cool-down routine. How could I improve this? What other exercises should I work on to improve my stamina? Speed? Are there any particular warm-up routines specific to this exercise?   Thanks! "
2265,Should we train calves 3 times per week?,"Once i heard, that a our calves have fast recovery time! And they are ""hard"" to grow, so some professionals defend the ideia of training it 3 times per week, what do you think? Someone have another method for calf training? "
2266,How to hit prescribed reps in last sets?,"For gaining muscle, you usually have to do between 8-15 reps with multiple sets. My problem is, for example, if I do close grip chin ups in my first set cleanly and without cheating 8 reps, and, as I progress to next sets with  1-1, 30 min rest between each sets, I can't do the exact amounts of reps which I did in first set. And, it will fall to 4-5 reps in 3rd or 4th set (because of lack of energy) and it will be changed from hypertrophy to strength.  So, what do you suggest? Should I cheat in last sets in order to hit the first set's rep range, or, should I increase my rest time? Will it preserve it's hypertrophy effect? "
2267,Crossfit without olympic weights at home gym,"I've started CrossFit at my gym, but now, I have to move. I can't train there anymore. I've got weights at home (dumbbells, barbell, various plates) but it's not the Olympic weights with the rubber outer coating. So now, I can't throw the weights around like they do in the videos. I've got a squat rack, bench, barbell, dumbbells, and sufficient plates. Some plates have grip slots.  Are there CrossFit routines I can do without dropping the weights? Which exercises would be good for my situation? Also, any further advise would be appreciated on how to build up a cost effective, dynamic and versatile home gym. "
2268,Is there anyway you can recover muscle mass that you've lost due to improper dieting?,"I've recently experimented with low carbing, calorie reduction and fasting. I think I messed it up for the past two weeks and have lost most of the muscle mass Ive gained.  I am a novice, started getting into calorie counting, macronutrient partitioning, fasting and weight lifting (with starting strength) at around october of 2013. Ive gained mass and lost some due to my erroneous dieting schemes. I tended to binge on some days then fast for 40 hours afterwards to keep up with my binges. I recently found out that my fear of carbs, while helping me lose body fat for a few days, ultimately led me to a downward spiral of binging after days of deprivation.  To cut things short, my last binge and fast afterwards episode has left me with muscle mass that is close to what I had when I was starting out and the body fat I have now has started to bounce back to levels I so dreaded to keep it away from. Is there anyway I can recover my muscle mass? My strength hasnt diminished yet but my muscle mass did. Ot are things too late for me? "
2269,Mid-Tension Hand Grip Good For beginners?,My personal trainer has suggested I work on my grip strength as he thinks that it is restricting me from reducing heavier(ie I have to lift lower weight as I do have trouble getting a good grip sometimes).  So I decided to get a hand grip tool and do it while I am watching tv. I have no clue what is good so I  just went to the store and bought a pair for $10  On the box there was no indication on the tension but now looking at the online site I see it is mid tension(not sure what the number for mid tension is)  Mid Tension Hand Grip  I was doing it yesterday and it is not too bad on my right hand(my dominate hand). I would have to double check but I think I can almost close it. With my left hand I get maybe half way.  I am not sure if I need a lower tension or if it is good what I have. I probably will get my trainer to check it out and see as well but always good to hear other thoughts.   Also even though it came with 2 of them I just use one and do 10 reps and then switch hands as I find it a bit easier to do then.  As I side question is this kind of design for hand grips any good? 
2270,Problem with shoulder workouts,"So I've been working on shoulders for quite some time. I often only do either:  1.Dumbbell or barbell shoulder presses (overhead, full extension).  2.Wall presses or press ups (push ups).  3.Chest and static weight holding with medicine ball out in front of chest.  So far I see no noticeable improvements in shoulder strength per se. I used to do bench presses, and it made virtually no difference either.  My concern is maybe I'm doing it wrong, so I'll demonstrate my form:  I tend to let the bar/dumbbell go down low enough for it to touch my clavicle/delts, and then push back up (no leaning back, etc.) with no jerking/momentum pushes (well, sometimes I will, but that's just for getting the most weight up for like a one-rep max).  Anyways, I either don't see any improvement in strength over doing this about once or twice a week over several weeks/months, and I'm guessing that the problem is possibly in lack of variation, perhaps?  Should I let the bar/dumbbell go down as far as possible, or should I stop almost near the bottom and go back up? Also, what are the best exercises for shoulder strength improvements (to increase shoulder/overhead presses, clean and jerk, etc.)? "
2271,Intermittent fasting and body building. Do they work together?,"I've read an article today which has a really interesting part:     Losing fat and gaining muscle can both be done, just not together.      However, if we get away from the small timeframes and start thinking   about our diet over the course of a week or a month, then we start to   have more options. For example, let’s say that you workout 3 days per   week. You could organize your eating routine to have a calorie surplus   on the days you train (i.e. gain muscle) and then a calorie deficit on   the days you rest (i.e. lose fat). That way, by the end of the week,   it’s possible for you to have spent 3 days gaining muscle and 4 days   losing fat.   Is this possible (gaining muscle and losing fat on the same week)? If it is should I eat more on resting days instead of on workout days? I thought that muscle gaining happens on resting days.  For the curious people: here is the article.  A note on my workout plan:  I was doing weight training a year ago for more than a year and I restarted it 4 months ago. Since I already have experience with it I hired a trainer to put together a plan for me which consists of 3 workouts per week (A B and C) so each muscle is moved once a week. So far I have managed to put on some muscle but also some fat. I would like to optimize my diet/workouts.  "
2272,Decrease calf size,"I'm a 18-year-old girl, I used to run (usually 1000/2000m competitions) and as a consequence now I'm left with quite big calves compered to the rest of my body. I'd like to know what I could do to reduce their size. I read many articles but I'm not quite sure about what to do since there are different (possibly opposite?) opinions on this subject.   Like, somebody suggested I should use an exercise bike for at least an hour with no resistance (so that the body would start 'consuming' the muscle), whereas others said I have to do high reps sessions of exercises targeting the calves or run (?!) on a treadmill.   Please avoid posting useless comments, I just need instructions and clarifications on how to slim down my muscles. Thanks!  "
2273,What should I do since my bent over row form was completely wrong?,"So, because I'm a bit silly and I guess I misread the description and never looked at any videos for it, I've been doing bent over rows completely wrong.  Instead of having my back mostly parallel with the ground, i was bending over roughly 45 degrees or so and doing it that way.  My current weight is 115.  Should I drop it 10-20% and start there (90-105)?  Or...? "
2274,Are the 7-Minute Workouts effective? (What are your preferred apps?),"I'm skeptical of the whole 7 Minute Workout movement that's started - I know that it's not meant to be the one workout of the day, rather it's meant to be used several times throughout the day or as a supplement.  Based on my understanding though, muscle gain or weight loss (whatever your goal), is best achieved within it at minimum 30 minutes.  To that end, I'm looking for:   Is the 7 Minute Workout effective? How many times per day should it be done? If it is effective, what are your preferred iOS apps for having them with you on the go?  "
2275,Should I do cardio if I want to gain muscle weight and lose fat?,"I'm 24, 1,83 cm and 70kg (6ft 0in, 155 lbs). Technically I'm not underweight but I could use some bulk. I have started doing some weight training (about 3 days a week) and I plan to get a personal trainer soon.   I've heard/read here and elsewhere that I shouldn't be doing cardio if my ultimate goal is to gain weight. But it bothers me that:    I have a just a little bit of a ""beer belly"" My conditioning seems poor. Specifically when it comes to certain nighttime recreational activities where I can't finish before I finish.    Should I be running the treadmill or cycling at the gym? Should I do morning jogs, or any cardio at all?  "
2276,Which muscle group am I missing in my workout routine?,"Every day, I do this:   Pull-ups. Suspension  dips. Leg lift (for abs). Side planks for abs. Biceps curls. Triceps curls. Chest-pull. Single-legged squat, up to full extension, including calf raise. Dumbbell shoulder press.   Question: which muscle group am I missing in my workout?    By reading comments/answers, reading articles, googling around, and using my logic: I am now considering this variation:   Pull-ups. suspension dips forward-leaning suspension dips (to activate more chest, front shoulder). Leg lift (for abs) leg lift until torso curls (for better abs). Side planks for abs. biceps curls chin-ups. triceps curls straight-up suspension dips (to activate more triceps). Chest-pull (to activate rear shoulder). Single-legged squat, up to full extension, including calf raise. Dumbbell shoulder press.   To me, this is the most efficient full-body workout I know of to date.  Thoughts? "
2277,Leg Muscle pain while running on treadmill,"My Fibularis Longus muscle pains when I run on treadmill or even on ground. Even with a less speed on starting running immediately this muscle starts paining. Initially I thought it would recover by the time as I was new with running, But its more then 3 months now but still pain is intact. Please suggest me what should I do? Stop Running? "
2278,100 push-up. I went from 36 to 28 after being sick. Is it normal? How can I improve?,"I am 29 years old, weigh 72kg (174cm tall), my goal is to do 100 ""good form"" push ups. I am following the hundred push ups training program.  I initially did 30, then I got up to 36. Then I paused for 17 days (hardly slept) and got sick (common flu but extremely tired). Now I can only do 28.  Question:    Is it common to drop so much after being sick? (36 to 28). I am also a vegetarian, could it indicate a problem with my diet? (I've been a vegetarian for 3 years, but have not exercised much). Will improving my stamina help me do more reps? The first reps are fine, but I have always had problem with the last. After being sick I find I have problems after just a few reps. A friend suggested I could add 5kg of weight on my back and do fewer sets / fewer push-ups. I would like to try, is it a good idea? How many per rep and how many reps?   I am very thankful for any help.  Details (if more info is required):  Initially I rested much longer between the reps than recommended (some times more than 5 minutes).   could do 30 on initial test so jumped in on week3 Week3 col3: finished 10/8 (failed last rep on each day though) Week4 col3: went fine for day 1 and day 2 (except last rep: 26/36 and 24/40 respectively) max out: 35   Now I kept the rest time between the reps exactly as it was recommended   Week5 col1: went fine except last rep (day1: 14/20, day2: 10/25, day3: 9/30) max out: 36 (had to repeat w5) Week5 col1: only did day 1 &amp; 2, went fine except last rep (day1: 15/20, day2: 11/25)   I had to pause for 17 days, during these days I hardly slept at all! I picked up the program again at week5 day2 column1, but failed on the second last rep, after which I was exhausted and did not even attempt the last rep. So I decided to go back to week4 column 2.   week4 col2: did not go very well, after a few reps I was so exhausted I had to break.   Then I got sick for about 8 days (the common flu but it got me bad and I was extremely tired just sleeping in the bed, likely also a backlash for hardly sleeping at all for those 17 days).  Now I want to start a fresh, and so did a max out to see where to jump in. I only managed to do 28. I thought I could start with week4 column 3 (says >= 25). But I failed already at the third rep.  Thinking that it is probably also my stamina (unable to efficiently rest between the reps), I have now started to run every other day (and indeed, I really feel how bad my stamina is comparing to just a few years ago!). "
2279,When is the best time of day to work out in order to take advantage of hormonal cycles?,"Lately I've been hearing a lot about hormonal cycles and how they change throughout the day.  From what I've heard, testosterone seems to be lowest in the afternoon and highest in the morning and evening.  I would think hormones like insulin, growth hormone, and cortisol could have some effects as well.  For the purpose of gaining strength and muscle, what is the optimal time of day to lift weights and why?  Edit:  not sure why this is getting downvotes.  Any feedback? "
2280,warming up to increase splits,"I'm working currently on increasing flexibility in my adductors (specifically the left leg, since it is stiffer than my right), and eventually would like to be able to do a full side split. Should I be warmed up to do my split stretches, or would I be fine simply doing the stretches standalone, without a warmup?  If I do need to warm up to effectively increase flexibility, what sort of warm up would suffice? "
2281,Swimming Pools.... Why 33m long?,"As the question states, for what purpose were some public swimming pools constructed as 33m in length? Was there a particular fitness requirement or event that meant this design was better than 25m or 50m length pools?  Question specifically related to UK based pools, but if other pools in other countries are also 33m in length, the same reason might apply. "
2282,"Isometric,Eccentric,Concentric training differences and what each is good for?","As in the title I wish to know:   What each of them is?

What are the downsides of each of them?What about upsides? Give a real life example on how to do each of them reported to ones 1RM at an exercise on choice(bench-press for example). How to correctly execute each of them.  "
2283,is it OK to drink glucose water during workout?,"I have started exercising a month ago. I do a two hour workout starting with 20 Min of cardio and then weights. I sweat a lot, and by a lot I mean wetting the floor kind of sweat. I weigh 600-700 grams less after a workout. I keep drinking water during this, a guy from the gym told me that I should mix something like Glucose or anything else to keep the strength up for the whole session. I also feel like I am totally exhausted after the first half hour, Is that a good Idea to do ? cause I think glucose have sugar and sugar is bad. right ?  "
2284,What is the cheapest protein source?,I have recently moved away from home and would like to continue weightlifting/gaining muscle. Food cost however is a big problem. My question is: what is a really cheap protein source? From my own investigation milk seems to run in at about 30g protein/dollar while sausage and canned tuna is around 13g protein/dollar. Are protein powders the best way (read cost effective) to get protein in terms of gram/dollar? Milk seems to be pretty decent in terms of calories and protein but I was wondering if the was something better in terms of price. 
2285,Calculating calories for weighted treadmill wlaking,"I found a formula that incorporated duration, distance/speed, body weight and incline to calculate the number of calories burnt when using the treadmill. Is there a simple way to adjust that formula if I were to wear weights while walking? Could I just add that to the body weight, or would that be way off? "
2286,Food a vegan should eat after weight lifting that is intended to build mass muscle?,What food should I eat?  I am assuming the aim is to eat food that has protien in it..  And the aim is to have the protien being absorbed fast.   Should I use a food supplement? such as a powder? 
2287,Is it unhealthy to to go from resting to exercise several times a day?,"I think I heard somewhere that it is bad for your body if you constantly go from resting to active by doing some sort of intense exercise straight before and after resting (for example, on the couch relaxing, jumping up and doing 20 or so pushups, going back to sit down). Is this true? If I aimed to do 100 pushups a day and spread it out throughout the day in sets of 20 as I mentioned earlier, is it bad for me? Should I instead try to do it all in one session?  Edit: In terms of 'unhealthy' I meant weight gain. "
2288,Correlation between Sweat and fat burning,"I was wondering about the place of your body where you sweat more during  workout and fat burning, Is there any correlation between them ?  For example, Having more sweat around your belly, means you are burning fat from your belly  ?  "
2289,Is Strava overestimating my calories burned from walking?,"Here's some Strava stats from a walk I just took after lunch:    Admittedly, I'm a fast walker.  But 289 calories seems to be way over the top for a 3.3km walk.  (Isn't the rule-of-thumb ""100 calories per mile"" for running?)  If it's correct, I probably have already burned away most of what I ate for lunch.  Question: Is Strava overestimating my calories burned from walking?  Since I'm attempting to use this app to assist in weight loss, an underestimation would be more helpful to me.  I'm running the app from my mobile phone.  I'm currently 70kg (hopefully not for much longer). "
2290,Is it true that swimming helps with sore muscles?,"I've heard from a lot of people that swimming helps relieve sore muscles, is it true?   If true, why? "
2291,What is the best/correct way to increase muscle/strength?,"What is the best overall way and types of exercises that can help? For exercises, how long and frequent? My body build is that of a female East Asian, and it is rather difficult for me to gain muscle, especially in the arms (think of the goal as strong punching and kicking strength). "
2292,What is a good body muscle %?,"I see references to body fat %, the ranges for great to obese, but I don't know where to find information on body muscle % or how to measure it?  I'm assuming it goes up as body fat % goes down if you're doing the same exercises - right? "
2293,When do I dispose my running shoes?,How many kilometers does a typical running shoes last?  What signs do I look for to see if is time to replace them? 
2294,Weighted press ups for abdomen,"Loading with weight crunches is no viable because at the end of the movement the weight actually drags you forward making the movement way easier than without weight, it only becomes viable when doing half repetitions of 15% degrees or less so it's more of an abdominal pulse than abdominal crunch.   And doing endless sets of crunches is not an option, after 150 I usually just get bored and give up.  I tried upside down crunches but for some reason the motion is just impossible, I try to crunch my spine but I end up doing a sit up by flexing my hips... almost as if my brain couldn't make the connection in order to understand the movement.   So as an alternative option, are weighted press ups enough to cause abdominal hypertrophy? Or is there a better close chain option?   Planks are excluded by default. "
2295,Neck Started paining after abs workout,I am new to abs exercises. I am doing this exercise 8-Min Abs Workout for past two days.   While doing exercise i am feeling lot of stress in my neck and abdomen. Today i am getting neck pain (front side) while gently pressing along sides of the food pipe.  Am i doing anything wrong ? 
2296,Difficulty to eat healthy food and weight loss,"First of all a couple of background lines to my question, so you can better understand what I am talking about.  I am a 31 y.o. man, working pretty much all day at my desk, with little-to-no-time at all for sports, after I've dealt with tons of other daily things. In the last 2 years I've put on a lot of weight (92kg weight x 1.76m height) because my habits changed a lot (I used to walk to go to my job - because I had time to do it - , I went dancing every Saturday - I had friends where I lived, now where I do I don't even have discos in a 30km radius - and so on...). I go in fitness-studio twice a week (rarely once, I always try to keep these hours as ""untouchable"" given the amount of other things to do), where I do in the following order: 10 minutes of cardio, 2 times a ""circle"" (each exercise works on a different muscle) without pause between the exercises but with a pause between the circles and at the end 20 minutes of cardio again. I have a nasty problem with food. I can avoid eating junk food, but I cannot eat all the healthy stuff there is, since most vegetables make me really puke. Same goes with fruit and most of the cheese. I do eat a lot of carbohydrates (there is not much left in the world with all I excluded, is there?).  I may sound ""polarized"" wanting some answers rather than others, but I am aware of what I can and can't do and answers like ""go out and run"" or ""eat vegetables"" will just disappoint me.  I cannot find more time to do exercise. Some days I am really exhausted and I need to rest. I cannot try to eat what I don't, because it makes me fell sick (literally) and I don't have time or money to sit by a psychologist and work that out. Is there anything at all that could help me? I am willing to try: diets (please consider my problems with food), different training (shouldn't exceed the time I have), integrators (vitamins, fat burners, carbohydrates absorbers, proteins, ...). "
2297,"Crossfit distance, how reliable is it?","First of all I'd like to say that I'm extremely unfit, with me being 5""10 and weighing in at 125kg. I am trying to get fit enough to go on a skiing trip with some friends at work in February so I've started to do around 10 mins(5 mins of which is just warm up exercises) of exercise most days a week on a crossfit trainer. As such I'm wondering what kind of goals i should be setting myself on the crossfit trainer and how comparable they are to walking/running. I have read online that the distance crossfit trainers show are more lenient than more natural exercises so I am unsure whether my current pace of 1.2km in 5 mins on the crossfit trainer is actually comparable to the same pace walking/jogging/running.  Does anyone know how much leeway I should give to this pace so I can more accurately compare to a person doing their pace off the machine?  I also feel a lot of the work being done towards the front of my legs and am worried that I'm not working all my muscles. I don't really have that good a balance on this machine so I feel I lean into the machine more than I should. Is this something I should be concerned about?  Any help would be much appreciated. Thanks! "
2298,What is the correct posture to support my weight with my arms while biking?,"When biking I find it natural to maintain my posture by keeping my arms straight and loading my weight on the handles. This has worked okay for me, until I need to get a hand off the handles to (e.g.) signal a change in direction. I find I have to sit upstraight relieving my weight on the saddle instead before I can safely do that, or I risk losing balance to the simple fact I'm pushing against the handlebar with one hand but not with the other.  This suggests me I'm not doing it right, and I should try to sit straight instead, even if it does feel ""wrong"" to me.  Here's a horrible, misleading drawing.    What's the correct posture while biking? Where should I relieve my weight? How can I improve it? "
2299,"Improve my ""Crossfit"" regime?","All Day Workout  I have time to play with, and I think I've been a bit random with my workouts. I want all round fitness, and I'd say I'm fairly intermediate.

My diet's helped but it's not golden, and I avoid alarm clocks. Stuck in a rut with weights. I expected my dead-lifting to suffer (went from 5 times a week to twice if that), but the dumbbells I use everyday aren't getting much easier. What's the best way to work martial arts into this?  "
2300,Are amount and location of knee pain good indicators of what is wrong?,"I've started cycling some long rides lately, and am feeling knee pain.  It doesn't seem serious, but it's insistent enough that I've mostly avoided riding for a few days.  When I do cycle, I do so at a high cadence, for short distances, and don't push myself.  The pain has been in various locations around the kneecap and also a bit at the back of the knee.  Sometimes it feels like bubbles inside the knee, which sometimes pop (crack), other times just soreness around the knee in areas that don't seem to be muscles.   The pain doesn't seem to have subsided significantly since I curtailed my riding activities.  So I have a couple of questions:  How much pain is an indicator that something serious is going on?  Does the specific location of knee pain indicate what's wrong? "
2301,passing out when holding breath,"I train a lot every week and sometimes after a very intensive training, when I hold my breath, I start to become dizzy. I did that about 3 times in the past, and the last time I did it I completely passed out.  It was quite scarry, mainly because I never passed out before. Is this an extreme case of something like thumb-tripping enhanced by the intensive training? Or is there something wrong with me?  Needless to say, I haven't repeated it since then...  (Also, I become dizzy after 10 seconds, but in normal conditions I can hold my breath over 2 minutes...) "
2302,Are there stretches or exercises that promote knee strength and prevent injury?,"I've started cycling some long rides lately, and am feeling some knee pain.  I don't know exactly what's wrong; I'm getting minor complaints from all over my knees.  See my last question for more detail.  So I'm wondering if there is a general course of exercise I can follow to help improve the overall health of my knees, and to avoid straining them.  What sorts of activities can worsen knee pain?  I usually spend a lot of time standing at the computer (in order to avoid back problems) but am worried that this may exacerbate knee problems.  I've also taken to bending at the knees in order to get at low things, like for example when doing the dishes.  What can I do to help improve the health of my knees?  Are there stretches or exercises I can do?  I've found a couple of questions which discuss exercises to help treat specific knee injuries, but I'm unsure whether to try some of these or to avoid them in case they make the situation worse given my specific problems. "
2303,Is working out with DOMS everyday bad?,"I'm currently following this bodybuilding workout routine :   Day 1 : Legs/Abs Day 2 : Upper body   6 days a week, with 1 rest day.  This has been nice for the past two months (I'm a beginner) but now, I have DOMS every day and when I have to workout legs and abs, I still have DOMS on legs and abs, same for upper body, even after the rest day.  Is it bad to always have DOMS and never train ""fresh"" muscles ? Is it an indicator that shows my muscles need more rest ? Should I change to a split routine ?   PS : I'd like to continue 6 days a week because I stopped smoking and working out really helps me not to smoke, it's way harder on rest day.    UPDATE  I edited the question in order to be more specific on having DOMS everyday, always and never train ""fresh"" muscles. I don't think this is a duplicate now. "
2304,Struggling with barbell row and overhead press - StrongLift,"Its been a month and a half since I started following SL 5*5 after a gap of around 6 months from the gym.  Having started from the empty bar, I have reached:  Squat - 110 lbs BP - 75 lbs Row - 80 lbs OHP - 55 lbs DL - 165 lbs  As you can see the barbell row and the OHP are lagging behind - for the row, everytime at the gym some trainer comes and ask what are you doing, this will ruin your back etc, so it has demoralized me a bit and made me conscious to check my form (I shot a video, but form looked OK).  And these days, squats are a bit challenging which leave me which less energy for remaining two exercises.  So my question is, is it time to leave this workout and switch to some conventional routine like doing machine rows, lat pulldown etc? If yes, then please help me build one. If not, then how do I progress with SL? Or should I just mix the two?  My current weight is 56 kg, height 180 cm. The gym has all standard machines and equipments.   Thanks. "
2305,How to tone without losing or gaining weight,"In the past 2 years I have managed to lose about 75 lbs.  It was a slow process as I am not as dedicated as should have been.  Unique Right now I am at the size I want to be, however I'm ""flabby"" I guess you could say.   I really dont want to loose anymore weight and also do not want to gain.  Talking to a couple friends both of which I do not think have ever weight problems are telling me I either need to:  Build muscle, protein drinks, weight lifting and lots of cardio   Tone muscle, Low cardio, light weight more reps weight lifting.  I think I want to Tone the muscle I have and possibly Build muscle where I lack.  Are they both right or is there a better way?  Also diet is important, is there foods that are better for what im trying to do.   Unique Also to help in my googling, does what Im trying to do have a name?  There is really nothing in the suggest duplicate that asks the main apart of my questions.  This question is geared toward people who have lost weight and have excess skin they are trying to tighten, find a question that is a duplicate of that and I will think about it. "
2306,Will a blocked nose affect my ability to breathe during swimming?,"I am a beginner. I tried to swim today with a blocked nose. I do not have any fever or cold otherwise; I am perfectly healthy apart from the blocked nose.   Will this have any effect on my swimming? During a couple of times, I quit my swimming stroke in the middle of the pool due to breathlessness. I am unsure if this is psychological or physical.  Does this also depend on the stroke? I was doing breaststroke.  "
2307,Why milk is not vegan?,I asked the same question to many persons but none of them gave me a satistfied answer.   If you want to say milk contains BACTERIA thats why its not vegan then every thing in the world would not be a vegan    I want a pure technical reason why is it so?? 
2308,"Coming back from injury, advise on deadlifts","Coming back from a car crash injury, was going to the gym a lot but had dropped deadlifts, recently re added to routine on light weights just as I know they are essential.   The injury was me shattering my kneecap, been advised to do leg extensions and things to strengthen my leg, however my gym does not have the leg machine. Find squats easy currently  Two questions for you all:  1: I did a light set two days ago (3x5 @70kg) on my upper day, Today I am doing lower, with squats, Should I do another light set of deads today on lower?  2: I did them the other day, and since them my metabolism seems to have gone through the roof, after one set is this correct? I usually drink 3 x 2L bottles of water over the space of work and the day, I find that my body feels always thirsty and that I want to consume them a lot quicker. (Not diabetic, blood sugar of 3.1) "
2309,What should I eat to recover from eating only `raw' fruits and vegetables for 6 months?,"About 2 years ago I've been eating only fruit and vegetables for 6 months. After that I have chosen to return to regular, diverse food - meat and everything else included. Since I started to eat normal food again I have felt some difficulties with my health:   After eating fatty food I feel like my blood vessels are being blocked, and my arms feel tense. I often get tired very soon, only after 2 or 3 hours of working (whether on computer, or outside) - BIGGEST PROBLEM!   I have talked to my doctor about the problem, but didn't receive any beneficial advice about my nutrition. I'm also a running-junkie, and while I'm running I feel fine, but soon after I finish, I feel like I'm very very low on energy. Now I'm trying to eat more carbohydrates, like rice etc.  Tu sum it up: after almost 2 years of being on normal diet again, I have feeling that I have quit being veggie just a few days ago, considering the problems that do bug me. Did anyone else have similar experiences? Any advice on nutrition or about whom should I consider talking to (I feel that professional health care workers don't know too much about these kind of problems)?  Edit 1.: Trying to clarify problem a bit. (I think that) I'm mainly having issues with food fried in oil or grease, because whenever I do eat that kind of food, if I don't go to walk or run outside in few hours after that I feel like my blood vessels are blocked (strange, uncomfortable feeling in chest, neck or hands). I asked about tiredness also because it seemed to me that it might be connected to this, but now I'm not so sure --- maybe it's about better balance of nutrients... Would be most grateful if someone made the same transition I did and if there were some of the problems I described. "
2310,Elbows cracking and popping,"I recently began to use many movements that are stressful on elbows all at once — pull-ups, pull-up holds, L-sit on paralletes, etc.  My elbows were sore afterwards — so I sensibly chopped out most of the exercises (I am a beginner for many elbow heavy exercises).  Now after stretching and massages of forearm muscles, a week later, my elbow are no longer sore. However when I lock and twist them they crack like crazy — something I've never experienced before. Should I be worried? Should I rest them longer, or slowly incorporate more exercises? The last thing I want is tendinitis. Thanks. "
2311,Food a vegan should eat after weight lifting that is intended to build mass muscle?,What food should I eat? I am assuming the aim is to eat food that has protien in it.. And the aim is to have the protien being absorbed fast.  Should I use a food supplement? such as a powder? 
2312,Biceps workout without supplement pain more than 4 days: Do i need whey?,"I saw an expert in Youtube said that muscle recovery took 3 days (roughly 72 hours) but it not same with my case.  I'm not bodybuilding and not using any kind of supplement. I'm doing more for strength and health but don't mind if my muscle size get bigger.  My other muscle (chest, triceps, etc) pain not last so long like my biceps.  Usually once in 5 weeks I'm doing biceps workout using dumbell.  The other weeks I'm not lifting. My life involving a lot of manual works like cutting trees manually and I'm avoid doing heavy workout during the other weeks.  I'm doing multiple sets. Start from second set onwards, I lift until I cannot lift. Then I continue next sets over and over until the last I can only barely lift once or twice reps.  The second &amp; third day is really painful and I cannot put my hand straight. Forth &amp; fifth day I still can feel pain on biceps.  I need to know if I consume whey, how it can help? Do I need to consume whey the next day while it recover even I'm not doing heavy workout? "
2313,How to properly stretch your Iliotibial Band?,"I've recently heard about having a tight Iliotibial Band and how its important to stretch it.  However since I've been stretching it (gentle 30 second stretches, a variety of them in succession), it seems to be getting tighter.  I don't know why this is or what I'm doing wrong, so I would like to know how to properly stretch my Iliotibial Band? "
2314,What kind of workouts can I get on a bicycle? ,"I currently do running, but it just isn't that fun for me anymore, and I'd like to turn my enjoyment of biking into fitness routine.   Do I need a certain style of bike to attain a more productive work out? My current bike is very old and broken, so I'm purchasing a new one anyway.  What kinds of work outs can I do using a bicycle? I am looking for something I can do on a daily basis within 30 minutes, that will help me to have better respiratory breathing, and burn off a few calories. What results can riding a bicycle yield on the body? "
2315,How can I increase my pull-ups reps?,Do I do as many as possible to failure?   Or do I stick to a weekly plan or multiple sets with low reps? 
2316,How to find your one repetition maximum?,Are these formulas close to every ones one rep max on varies exercises? and  I would like to know how accurate this is for everyone and if you have anything better?  Formulas to find your one rep max (or 1rm)  2 reps- 1.06 x weight lifted= 1rm 3 reps- 1.09 x weight lifted= 1rm 4 reps- 1.12 x weight lifted= 1rm 5 reps- 1.15 x weight lifted= 1rm 6 reps- 1.18 x weight lifted= 1rm 7 reps- 1.21 x weight lifted= 1rm 8 reps- 1.24 x weight lifted= 1rm 9 reps- 1.27 x weight lifted= 1rm 10 reps- 1.302 x weight lifted= 1rm   Example on how to use-  I went to the gym today and benched 300 pounds for 5 repetitions so i apply the formula 5 reps- 1.15 x 300 pounds = 345 pounds for my one rep maximum 
2317,Risks of having a low caloric intake and high activity,"At 5'10, 160lbs I was an athletic build.  After I started rock climbing 6 months ago (4 hrs every other day with hard training ie sit ups, push ups, campus board...) I jumped to 170lbs in the first month with noticeable muscle mass increase.  In the past three months I am down to 155lbs with visible abs and even more muscle definition/mass.  This prompted me to take a look at my caloric intake vs output and I found soemthing that may be of concern.  According to many online calculators they gave me a result of 3800-4200 calories burned for 1 hr hard cycling per day and 4hrs rock climbing with training and all the normal daily tasks like walking.  After inputting the food I eat( all extremely healthy, no processed, almost gluten free and vegan except for eggs), the calculators say I consume 1600 calories!  What are the ramifications of having such a low intake to output ratio?  Can this be sustained? If not how does one fix this? "
2318,Scientific evidence that higher mTor levels generated by high protein diets and strength training result in lower life span?,"I have have heared that higher mTor levels lead to a shorter live span. Now high protein diets and strength training or bodybuilding tend to rise the mTor level. So you might think that such a fitness lifestyle leads to a lower lifespan.   But as always you need to check the details before making such a conclusion. So, is there any scientific evidence of this claim? Or may it be falsified?  What are the details of the claim that higher mTor levels result in a shorter lifespan and what is a ""high level"" in this case? Is it about constant high levels or about spikes? How does this compare to what is induced by high protein diets and bodybuilding? "
2319,Running question,Since a 3 months i started running 3 times a week(about 30 minutes now last few weeks). Next thing i want to work on endurance and speed and was thinking to do 2 times per week HIIT run(30 minutes) and one longer run building up to an hour in 10 weeks. Would this be a good idea? Or could it be a recipe to injury?  Thanks in advance for your ideas and comments. 
2320,Should you work through soreness?,"I started working out on Tuesday and today is my second workout. I did squats on Tuesday and today my legs are still so sore I have trouble going from standing to sitting, sitting to standing, and stairs are just mean and nasty. Should I still do squats today or skip them? I am not injured, its not that kind of pain, but I am VERY sore. To add to my question what causes this kind of soreness and is there anything that can be done to minimize it or shorten the recovery? "
2321,Rotator cuff exercises not intended to build muscle?,"Although the reasoning behind using low weights for rotator cuff exercises has been discussed in this post, I still feel that there is something I am uncertain about. I have heard people say about rotator cuff exercises that they are ""not a muscle building exercise"", for example in this video.   My questions is, lets say that you are doing the exercise with perfect form and not allowing the bigger muscles to take over (as expressed in the other fitness question linked to), should you not try to push yourself with the exercise (in order to build the muscle up)? Otherwise the muscle would surely stay at the same strength level? Or is the point only to warm it up? I have had issues with my rotator cuff and am still unsure how much to push with the exercises. "
2322,Is doing squats using a rack with rails defeating the purpose?,I moved recently and the gym here doesnt have a free standing squat rack. Instead it has one of these racks with rails  [website]I can feel my legs/glutes working but clearly it is not the same. The rails restrict the range of motion so I dont feel the full body workout Im used to. The muscles that would normally attempt to stabilize and hold the bar are not activated.  I have been doing squats mostly since it has helped strengthen supporting muscles and helped me deal with lower back pain.  I'm not sure if I should continue using it. Any thoughts? 
2323,Easing finger pain during Pull-ups,"I do pull ups on a pair of wooden rings. Before this I used to use metal bars at my local park. While I don't get a torn skin (where the fingers join the palm), like when I was using the bar, any more, the bottom third of my finger now gets really depressed and the skin is pushed upwards. This really hurts while doing Pull-ups, while it didn't using a bar.  Has anyone had this happen to them? What do I do? I know I can probably wear gloves, but I don't want to sound like a wimp and would rather have my hand conditioned to handle this, considering I want to progress doing Parkour next.  I tried using Gym chalk as well, but find no difference and the pain persists.   "
2324,Triathlon Training Programs: Time based for Run,"So in most triathlon training programs swims are distance based, and bike and runs tend to be time based.  For example this plan  I am decently fast on the bike, but really slow on the run.  In my HIM coming up I expect to complete the bike between 2:15 and 2:30 and this training plan has several bikes in this time frame, so no problem.  However, on the run, I am hoping that I can complete it in about 2:30, although I doubt I will.  It will probably be close to 3 hours after the other two events.  11:27/mile gets it done in 2.5 hours, and the three hour mark would involve some walking.    Ignoring my slow speeds for a moment, this plan has the longest run of 1:30.  To finish a half marathon in this amount of time, we are talking a pace of 6:52/mile, kind of blistering especially for a guy my age.    So my questions are:  Why are the runs for most tri training programs time based?  Why are the short in relationship to the bike?  Should I adjust up my running time or even do some distance based running?  What should be my long run when training for a HIM? "
2325,Pain after squats (sprain?),"After the latest legs day I had pain in the inner side of the place between leg and groin. It hurts only during the lowers part of the squat and press machine (I didn't notice anything during that workout thought). I didn't pay much attention to it, however after a week on the next legs day I felt it during the warm-up squats with empty barbell and when I put the weight I couldn't perform because of it. So I skipped squats and press machine and only did other machines for legs ( and it didn't hurt there ). Is it a sprain and what do I do about it? When can I start squatting again? "
2326,Does volume influence duration of super-compensation phases?,"I was recently climbing for a good 4 hours, and afterwards I did weighted pullups (Enough weight to hit my 2RM). I did 6 sets of that, then i did the same with some  intense pushup variations, and lots of functional/assistive training.  I noticed that two days later, instead of feeling stronger as usual, I felt MUCH weaker, especially in my shoulders.  This leads me to my question; do the super-compensation phases arrive later if I train harder? And is this an indicator that the training was too much? "
2327,Deadlift - weight & reps too light & too many?,"Although I've always been active in the gym and have done weight training (bicep curls, squats, chest press) yet I have only just started getting into deadlifts as I'm trying to train ""better"" and this is a highly recommended exercise. I've been doing them once a week for a month, along with my other exercises like squats.  I am currently weighing 75kg and once warmed up deadlifting 60kg up to 85kg (187lbs). I'm doing many single reps, probably spending half an hour doing them totalling 50 in total I guess.  In a recently exercise book the guy mentioned three sets of 5-8 reps for deadlifts. Very different to my pattern. I notice that I seem to get a dull ache in my lower back the next day, which has caused me to rethink what I am doing.  Should I be reducing my total reps for deadlift? What would a good target weight be, relative to bodyweight?  (I appreciate I need to work up to it whilst practicing my technique)  EDIT: My goals are not to enter competitions etc but rather to increase my overall strength. One specific thing is I'd like to get bigger, more powerful legs to develop a stronger front kick in karate, as well as a stronger core for the upper body exercises I do. "
2328,Prevent muscle decreases after injury (left arm),"I'm a calisthenics enthusiast training towards advanced exercises like (Tuck-) Planche, Handstand Push Ups, (Ring-) Muscle Ups, Human Flag, etc. Because of a torn muscle fiber in my left forearm, I have to pause doing such exercises for at least 6 weeks. Now I am afraid of loosing muscles in my arms and shoulders. Which other exercises can I do in order to prevent muscle decreases as best as possible? Other suggestions are greatly appreciated as well!    Update: Recently, I talked to a sports student who encouraged me to do sports despite my injury. He told me it is fine (even beneficial) to load the injured muscle - provided it does not hurt - to strengthen it from the very beginning. Now, after two weeks of recovery, it actually feels okay to do some push ups or hand stands.  What do you think? Is he right that loading the muscle a bit can be beneficial for the recovery, or do you recommend to rest strictly? "
2329,Exercises for a strong neck,"I have 'necklected' neck exercises so far, and would like to change that. What are some exercises for a strong neck? Is a one of those head harness necessary? The only device I have and use regularly is a kettlebell. I don't want it to be bulky, or strong enough for martial arts, I just want toned muscles. "
2330,Lower back pain during heavy squats,"Doing squats with a light weight (25% of max) I find no problem, but once I go to 50% of max (barbell i.e. not in a smith machine) and get to my third set of 20, I feel a dull pain in my lower back at the insertion point for the hamstrings. It's not my muscles that cause me to stop, it is this pain. Working at a higher weight is the same, so it appears to be fatigue. Going to the leg press machine (sat down) there is no pain in the lower back at all.  I had thought that tight hamstrings might be the cause of this, given where the pain is, but can anyone give me some advice as to how I can be certain? Or what I can do to alleviate this? "
2331,How to perform a ring muscle up?,"What would be a good progression to transition from where I am currently: Horizontal Ring Row and Ring Dip to a full ring muscle up (As opposed to a bar muscleup, which is an entirely different focus/movement)?  This question is unique as it only focuses on the progression required for a ring-specific muscle up. Other questions here considered bars.  Previous answers can be summarised to:  - Practice the transition (what transition? What are the cues/movements?)  - Develop strength (I am plenty strong for them).  No-one yet has explained the technique. "
2332,Combining weightlifting and martial arts,"MY HISTORY  I am a 27 year old man that has been weightlifting seriously for more than one year now. I have also doing some martial arts before, and want to get back at it again.  Height: 178cm/5 ft 10 inch Weight: 90kg/198lbs   These are my PRs:  Deadlift (regular) eq - 140kg Squat eq - 115kg Bench press - 80kg   MY CURRENT SETUP  I'm going through a existing program. You'll see that 4x6-10xWEIGHT is 4 sets and 6 repetitions the first week. Then we do 4x8xWEIGHT the next week and then 4x10xWEIGHT and then increase to a higher weight. The same goes for the first set 1x3-5xWEIGHT.  Monday - Workout 1 - Deadlift - 1x3-5xWEIGHT (Maximum effort set) Monday - Workout 1 - Deadlift - 4x6-10xWEIGHT (Less weight and higher volume) Monday - Workout 1 - Military Press - 1x3-5xWEIGHT (Maximum effort set) Monday - Workout 1 - Military Press - 4x6-10xWEIGHT (Less weight and higher volume) Wednesday - Workout 2 - Bench Press - 1x3-5xWEIGHT (Maximum effort set) Wednesday - Workout 2 - Bench Press - 4x6-10xWEIGHT (Less weight and higher volume) Wednesday - Workout 2 - Assistance Chin Ups - 4x6-10xWEIGHT Wednesday - Workout 2 - Bent-over barbell row with overhand grip - 4x6-10xWEIGHT Friday - Workout 3 - Squats - 1x3-5xWEIGHT (Maximum effort set) Friday - Workout 3 - Squats - 4x6-10xWEIGHT (Less weight and higher  Friday - Workout 3 - Chins - 4xMAX   MY GOAL  My goal for weightlifting to the next summer:  Deadlift (regular) eq - 180+kg Squat eq - 150+kg Bench press - 100+kg   My goal is to include two times of a week tuesday and thursday for martial arts as well. I just loved it before i remember, but quit because I had a damage to my rib, it was a crack and I couldn't doing it for a time and then time just went on...  The question here though is can I keep increasing in results in my weightlifting for building strength and mass as well as the martial arts training at the same time? Do I get enough of rest for my body to recover and get stronger?  Is it recommended combining these together? "
2333,Rest Period between Exercises?,"So people (including me) obviously talk about resting in between two sets of the same exercise and how long they should be. Now I'm wondering, what about rest in between two exercises (in addition to the small rest you get from warmup-sets, switching plates or cleaning up after yourself).  For start, it's clear that you don't really need a rest period between let's say a bench press and a row, because they work completly different muscles. But what about exercise combinations like Squat + Lunge, Deadlift + Leg Curl or Pullup + Row?  Is a rest period between two exercises that work similar muscles, like given in the above example, recommended? If yes, how long should they be in relation to the between-set-rest period? "
2334,Poor form at lower pace,"I find that when I am running at race or tempo pace (between 5:30/mile and 7:00/mile) I find it easy to engage into good form and settle into comfortable running. However when I slow it down towards easy run pace (circa 8:00/mile) I find it hard to keep up good form. I tend to find myself slouching and I generally feel uncomfortable, tense and end up with lower back pain and the run ends up feeling laborious rather than easy. If I consciously make an effort to run with good form I just end up speeding up and ending up back at tempo pace which completely defeats the point of an easy run. Does anyone have any tips on how I can keep good form and still maintain easy run pace? Are the any techniques I could adopt etc? "
2335,Training program to get muscles mass,"I was reading the accepted answer of What are the trade-offs of weight versus repetition? in which the user add this picture:    However I get  surprised by the training tips given.  According to the picture, to get mass muscle you should practice at least five times a week  ! do 4 to 8 sets with 6 to 12 repetition.  Questions : Are those tips  in the picture correct (scientifically ) ? What about the rest days that plays an important role in building muscles ? On the other hand, if this is not the convenient training way, what is the optimal sets-reps programs  in order to get muscles mass ,  and how many times should one practice a week ?   Thank you in advance. "
2336,Does pushups help in straightning back?,"Straight back is very important thing and most of the people does not have a straight back. Normally people tend to sit with bending and hence faces problems in long run.  Does pushups help in getting a straight back? If yes, which sort of pushups are recommended? else, which exercise will help the most in achieving a straight back? "
2337,Next to no glute / hamstring activation when squatting,"What to do?  Even when squatting without weight, I just  feel like the quads are doing 99.8% of the work. Lately I've been having some discomfort while squatting with higher weights. Is there a way to   target specifically those muscles? "
2338,herbs / teas for sleep and side effects of melatonin and dipenhydramine?,what are some herbs / teas for sleep  and what are side effects of melatonin and dipenhydramine taken long term?   Please stop closing my questions there isn't really a nutrition/supplements stackexchange  and I don't want to book a doctors appointment to ask about this? 
2339,How can I make myself get enough sleep?,"I hope this question is on-topic for this site. It seems to me that sleep is a pretty big ingredient in fitness.  I pretty much never get enough sleep. It's not for lack of trying though. I just can't seem to do it. I find it very difficult to fall asleep. And also very difficult to get out of bed in the morning!  A large part of my problem is that I'm a night person by nature. Even if I'm tired all day long, I often feel wide awake after the sun sets. However to get to work on time during the week, I must get up by 7:30am at the absolute latest. That means that in order to get 8 hours of sleep, I would need to fall asleep by 11:30pm every night. At 11:30pm I am generally not inclined to sleep. Even when I turn all the lights out and go to bed, I find myself staring at the ceiling for a couple hours before finally drifting off.  It's not just a night-time problem though. There have been times where I've been extremely tired and I've tried to nap during the day. Sometimes I can do it, but often I just can't fall asleep, despite being tired. I seem to have an all-around insomnia problem. But it is usually easier to sleep during the day than at night.  I've already talked to 2 doctors about this, and neither of them was very helpful. They gave me some suggestions, which I've tried my best to follow, but it didn't make much of a difference. They did not seem to think that there was a medical cause for my condition. They didn't offer to prescribe me any medication, and I didn't ask.  Admittedly one thing I've been bad about is getting up and going to bed at the same time every day. I make an effort to do so, and I must be at work at the same time every day Monday-Friday, so you would think it would be easy. But if I don't fall asleep until 2:00am or even 3:00am some week nights, then by the time the weekend comes around I may really be exhausted and I may give in to the temptation to sleep past noon, which feels great but probably prolongs my problem.  I do think that the problem is probably largely psychological, because I often find it easier to sleep in hotels and in strange places than I do in my own home. No idea why.  Things I've tried:   Avoiding caffeine after 12:00pm. This was something my doctor recommended. I actually have tried to quit caffeine altogether a few times, but I always keep coming back to my morning coffee. Over-the-counter medication - Sleep aids like diphenhydramine often (but not always) make me drowsy. Still, I've found that even when they make me drowsy, that doesn't necessarily mean I can fall asleep. It's like my brain fights a loss of consciousness down to the last. I tried a number of over-the-counter solutions for 1-2 weeks each, then stopped using them because they didn't seem to help. Eating a heavy meal shortly before bed - Same as above. It may make me more drowsy, but doesn't seem to actually cause sleep. Keeping non-sleep activities out of the bedroom - I'm haven't been 100% faithful, but I moved my computer and my desk out of my bedroom, and I try to keep my portable gadgets out of there, at least when I remember. Staying away from screens before bed - I listed this here because I have attempted it, but honestly I didn't really succeed. My life is pretty much run by computer and as long as I'm awake I'm probably near a screen. Exercise - Exercising within 3 hours or so of going to bed completely destroys my ability to sleep. I become ""wired"" and full of energy. Exercising earlier in the day seems to increase my need for sleep (it's harder to get out of bed the day after I do strenuous exercise), but doesn't seem to increase my drowsiness or ability to fall asleep at night.   I'm really at my wits end trying to solve this problem. I feel like it's affecting my health and my quality of life, and it's definitely affecting my fitness routine.  How can I learn to fall asleep, and keep good sleep habits? Does anyone have any ideas? "
2340,Are military presses any worse than any other exercise?,"In a few different sites and blogs, there's a lot of mention of military presses being bad for the shoulder.  Are they any worse than any other exercise? and if so, what would be an alternative method to get the same results?  "
2341,Breathing during running,"I recently started a C25K program. I'm in the UK and using the NHS C25K podcasts and last night I did the first day of week 2 - the voice over told me that during the running segments I should be trying to breathe in for four steps and out for four steps, specifically counting four steps of my left foot for each (so: breathe in, L, R, L, R, L, R, L, R; breathe out, L, R, L, R, L, R, L, R).  Now, I am very unfit indeed (hence doing the program in the first place) and I do end up quite out of breath during the workouts, but there is NO WAY I can manage to inhale for that long while running. I can just about manage half that (breathe in, L, R, L, R; breathe out, L, R, L, R).  My husband, who is much fitter (but not particularly a runner), said that he wouldn't be able to do that either.  So the question is: is this really sensible advice that I should be TRYING to follow (as in actively working on extending my breathing pattern), or is it something that will happen anyway as I get fitter / better at running, or is it just daft advice that I should ignore?  I've seen When running out of breath, keep breathing rhythm or take in air? and Breathing Pattern while running but neither of those are quite the same question. "

2345,Securing feet in an indoor rowing machine,"Most rowing machines in gyms I've come across use simple straps to secure your feet, like those shown below:    The problem I've always found is that after a few strokes the straps loosen, which I feel causes me to lose power on the recovery of the stroke as part of the power is lost to more loosening and leads to a slight ""jump"" when reaching the slack.  I guess the question is two-fold:   Is a little looseness enough to worry about? If so how can I better tighten the foot straps so they stay tight for the full session?  "
2346,Absolute beginner : dumbbells and incline bench,"I got a set of dumbbells and an incline bench, and just started some basic exercises.

Bench press  Incline press  Incline fly  Seated shoulder press Bent row Seated curl Side bend Pull over Triceps extension   (NO LOWER BODY EXERCISES DUE TO MEDICAL CONDITIONS)  I assumed I should able to lift more weight than that!

2347,How to increase running performance over years?,"It's been almost four years since the first time i started running, here is my background:   I'm 26, i practiced gymnastic for about seven years, from age three to eleven, i swam regularly but not anymore, and i go sometimes snowboarding.   I run three times a week, and fill the gaps with core and strength exercises three or four times a week (45 minutes, warm up, core, cool down), i don't go to gym, but do workout home with no couch of course, i use Nike training club.    I notice that my performance hasn't changed much, during these four years, i mean after a 10K i feel about the same as i did four years ago. I have never succeeded to run more than 22k, and whenever i tried to boost my records by following a plan, like increasing my average distance from 30 km to 50 or more i ended up injuring myself, i tried to run four times per week, my plan had four different running styles, a long run usually between 15 and 18 kilometre, followed by a recovery run at low pace about 6 kilometre,  an interval of 30 minutes and a medium run about 8 or 7 kilometre. Here is an overview of my typical long run 15k, the horizontal axis represent time.        About injuries, shin splint at sides, both legs and recently i found out, my front joints (ankle) are permanently deformed it happened during summer after a two though session, 18km and a 12km. I need to pay visits to kinesis physical therapy practice to get rid of inflammation.   I change my shoes when they hit 800 km, my right leg (injured) over pronates, but i always buy the right shoes.   I'm about 1.65m and 57 kg, i have an amazing diet and i don't suffer from any disease or chronic injuries.  I really want to run longer and more times per week, but seems impossible.  Could the reason be that i started running too late? Is my age letting me down? could it be related to my genetic? Or i need to build up for a stronger body ?  "
2348,Should I be doing dips or push ups?,"I am currently trying to progress on both the hundred push ups and the one fifty dips programs.  I cannot do them on the same day of course, they both put a huge strain on my triceps. And while reading some other question on this site I stumbled across a link saying:     If you are doing more than 15 Push-ups per set, you should definitely be doing Dips. The Push-up is only really included as an alternative for people who lack the upper body strength to do 3 sets of Dips, so the goal is definitely to move away from them.   I wonder if this is true in for my case or only in relation to the proposed program behind that link.  My goal is to achieve upper body strength (strength-endurance mainly), not to complete one or both of the programs. I only use them as some means of progression, I do other exercises besides them for other muscle groups. My question really only is about dips vs push ups.  My questions are: What is the real difference between dips and push ups? Under which circumstances should I choose which exercise? What would be an effective method to combine both of my programs? (eg one week dips, one week push ups) "
2349,Overgrown quadriceps of legs - crunching in the knees,I'm training the spinning (cycling) and currently I have overgrown quadriceps of legs (this is the diagnoze of my doctor). He advise me that I should train different part of the legs -not the quadricpes but the two-headed muscles of legs. Do you know any good training only for this part? I don't want to give up with the spinning but also it would be good to keep the health. Any ideas? 
2350,Are drop sets effective?,"A very commonly performed action in bodybuilding is the drop set.  In which, you do your working sets.  Then on the last set, you go to failure, drop the weight, go to failure, drop the weight, go to failure, and repeat however long.  There's no doubt that this feels like it's effective. What I'm wondering is, is there is any research to back all this up? Do people who do drop sets actually build muscle at a faster rate? Or is it a matter of diminishing returns, and all this is doing is adding more work with very little reward? "
2351,Weightloss seems stagnant despite much efforts,"I've been following a random weightloss/fitness plan since January 1st and it seemed to be working. I started with 236 lbs and by the first week of February, my weight fluctuated around 215 lbs. I also lost about 6 inches off my waist. My weight goal is 175 lbs.  Previous Regimen  Breakfast: 2 boiled eggs and a juice blend (I blend them myself: a tablespoon scoop of whey protein, spinach, grapes, strawberry, and blueberries with orange juice) on M/W/F, cereal (the ones with fiber and raisins) on Tue/Thur. Weekend breakfast revolves around these as well. Eating breakfast was not a daily activity until I started the program.  Lunch: This varies, but it revolves around brown rice or sandwiches. While the calorie content isn't always known (for the rice), I try to keep it under 600 calories.  Dinner: It varies around salad (romaine, raisins, lettuce, honey mustard sauce with about one tablespoon of cooked chicken) or brown rice / cereal; small portions used as well.  Snacks: Apples and nuts; I'm usually not hungry. I indulged in some hamburgers twice in that period.  Exercise: 30 - 45 mins of Insanity videos every week morning. On weekends, I played (sometimes) tennis, soccer, or dumbbell lifting (25 lbs each) and crunches for about an hour or two.   I followed that program until about 3 weeks when I heard about Strong Lift and read about being fit and strong. By this time, I had already lost 20 pounds.    My current regimen  Diet is still the same (with minor adjustment such as eating chicken wraps for lunch/dinner or skipping dinner when full).   Exercise: This has significantly improved.  On weekdays, I start the day with 3 exercises for 15 mins: pushups, v-rollups, chair dips. Then, I have a 30 mins Insanity workout (Insanity Abs and P90X Abs on Mondays/Fridays, any other cardio on other days).  In the evenings,      On Mon/Wed/Fri, I do 3X5 weight-squat, deadlift, and bench press (current weight is 90 lbs). Then, I perform some non-traditional workouts such as pushing heavy items (about 80-100 lbs) for about 15-20 mins and abs strengthening workout (lying on the ground, putting two 70 lbs on my stomach for about 5-10 mins). Basically, I try to do as much strength exercises as possible for about an hour and half.  Tue/Thur are for cardio; Insanity videos and P90X are used; I add abs workout to the mix sometimes.   Saturday is a free-for-all when I try to do as much of everything as possible  Sunday's a free day when I don't have to workout; however, I might do some bicep or abs workout if I want  I also carry a 35lbs dumbbell to work that I lift during traffic; I perform some crunches on my desk whenever possible, and even some more pushups.   My goal isn't to lose weight anymore; it's to have an athlete's body: strong, fast, and flexible.   I'm seeing more changes to my body as it's becoming more taut; I'm having more energy to do daily activities and such. However, it seems that it's not reflecting on the scales. Since the time I started the new regimen, I've only lost about 3lbs and about 0.5 inches (in 3 weeks!). It's a little depressing because I still want the scales to go down.  I seemed to lose more weight when I wasn't doing heavy exercises than now.   Am I doing something wrong that's reducing the amount of weight lost? Body exhaustion? Is there any reason my body would be trying to conserve its fat?    BTW, I don't really feel exhausted at night; body soreness usually lasts for a few mins.   I believe I'm exercising and eating right; however, the scales have stopped showing the results and although I'm looking and feeling better, I'm still not seeing as much result as I would have loved (I still have some pouch that's got to go).

2352,three months workout building visible body,"I workout more than 6 months. I eat fruits, protein, vegetables and much more meals than my will to eat. The truth is 64 kg before and now I am  67 kg.   My body has shown results with little visible muscle. I have heard on three months someone building body with visible muscles. I don't.   I have a nice program for full part of body, I sleep enough more than 8 hours a day, I drink a lot water at least 1 litre a day. I stop joking (only one time a week for 3 hours). Is true that muscles can be much visible of a thin guy or we are talking for peels (unhealthy way with ""drugs"") in three months?   I look my food I don't buy protein from shops. I take Quaker, eggs, chicken etc for protein not chemicals. Someone can build visible muscles in three months or I don't doing something right? Six months and not terrible results to be so obvious my muscles but yes I have progress. "
2353,Stronglifts - Why is my bench press/row progress lagging behind?,"I have been following the Stronglifts program since February of this year, so I've been at it about 6 months. I had tried the program before, but I had been away from it for some time, so I started back at the beginning. I started with just 42 lbs on all my lifts, and added 5 pounds every week for as long as I could, removing 10% of the weight on the next workout if I failed a few times in a row.  The Stronglifts program uses 5 main lifts - squats, bench press, deadlift, overhead press, bent over rows. I've often heard that squatting 1.5 times your bodyweight is a good milestone to aim for, and that more-or-less coincides with the strength goals that the Stronglifts creator suggests, so I adopted those goals as my own. My target lift weights are:   Squats: 270 lbs (5x5) Deadlift: 360 lbs (1x5) Bench Press: 200 lbs (5x5) Barbell Row: 180 lbs (5x5) Overhead Press: 120 lbs (5x5)   I started with 42 lbs on all exercises back in February. Here's where I am now:   Squats: 257 lbs Deadlift: 242 lbs Bench Press: 117 lbs Barbell Row: 92 lbs Overhead Press: 92 lbs   (The reason my lift weights all end in 2 or 7 is because my bar weighs 32 lbs instead of the standard 45 lbs. It's an olympic-style bar, 7' long, 2"" collars that rotate. Just the weight is off. I didn't know this when I bought it).  As you can see, my squats have progressed nicely. I'll be doing 262 lbs next workout, and my initial goal of 270 lbs is very nearly in reach. My overhead press isn't too bad either, I feel it's progressed at a similar pace.  In case anyone is curious about why my deadlift weight is less than my squats, it's due to grip strength. I tried to deadlift 252 lbs and I dropped the bar. It just slipped right out of my hands. Even when using mixed grip. But that's a question for another time....  What concerns me right now is that my bench press and barbell row weights seem to be progressing much much slower than my other lifts. Even though I'm squatting 95% of my target weight, my bench press is less than 60% of the weight I'm aiming for. And it seems like I plateau constantly. I feel similar about my bent-over rows. I've definitely made some progress, but the progress seems extremely slow compared to my squats and overhead press.  I have no idea what the cause of this could be. I've tried many times to check my form against videos I've seen posted online, and I've made some adjustments (wider grip on the bar during bench press, etc), but although adjusting my form did seem to help a bit, the difference was not dramatic.  The Stronglifts program prescribes lifting 3 times per week alternating between a squats/overhead press/deadlift workout and a squats/bench press/rows workout. I admit my follow-through hasn't been 100%, but I have been working out at least twice per week most weeks.  When I first started, I rested 1 minute between sets. Currently I'm resting about 5 minutes between sets for squats, and 3 minutes for all other lifts.  So, can you tell me please, why is my progress at the bench press and barbell row lifts so much slower than my progress with squats/overhead press? Is this normal? You might need more info from me to answer this question, but I don't know what else to offer off the top of my head. I will try to be proactive about answering any questions in the comments. Thanks in advance.  Additional Info requested by StupidOne:   Warm ups: I do warm up sets before I do all exercises. Typically I start with about 50 pounds, do one 5-rep set of the exercise. Then I add between 20 and 50 pounds and repeat, until I've got the full weight and I'm doing my first ""official"" set. For example, the last time I did bench presses, I did 1x5 at 52 lbs, then 1x5 at 82 lbs, then 1x5 at 102 lbs, then 5x5 at 117 lbs (my work weight).  Stretching Exercises: None, really. My research has left me unconvinced that they do much good.  Diet: I aim to eat about 200 grams of protein per day, although I sometimes fall short. I often start the day with 2 greek yogurts, and I eat a lot of chicken. Based on historical data, I burn about 3100 calories per day on average. I aim to eat slightly less than that so that I'll lose body fat, but I often fail. The other day I actually had 4900 calories in one day! Well, I don't ignore my hunger.... I'd say my average caloric consumption is probably about 3200 calories. I always eat something high protein (greek yogurt, cottage cheese, grilled chicken breast, protein shake, etc) immediately after weight training.  My diet could definitely use some improvement though, as I still eat out way too much and I know that's hampering my efforts to lose weight (and save money)!  By the way, I currently weigh about 218 lbs, which is about 10 lbs more than I did when I started Stronglifts in February. My goal is to get down to between 180-190 lbs. I've got a belly that needs to go.  Rest between sets:   As I said, I rest up to 5 minutes between sets for squats, and about 3 minutes for other exercises. This is based on advice I've read on a number of internet sites, such as this question in the Starting Strength Wiki FAQ:  At first you can probably get by with no more than 2-3 minutes between sets. However, once the weights start getting heavier, you may take upward of 5 minutes between sets. Near the end of your training cycle, especially when you are setting PRs (personal records) in the squat, deadlift, and power clean you could be resting upward of 7 minutes  Granted, Starting Strength is a 3x5 program, and I'm doing a 5x5 program. I don't know for sure if this is good advice, but I think I've read similar things other places.  Update 2 - August 20, 2011   As promised, here's a graph of my workout weights so far. The weights are expressed as a percentage of my goals. Note that my previous statement that my overhead press got to 102 lbs was apparently incorrect. According to my records, the heaviest press I've done was 92 lbs.    Full size picture at [website]"
2354,How to know if eating sufficient calories for muscle growth?,"As brief background: years ago I was obsessed with getting a 6-pack. I was possibly the worst body type: skinny but with a flabby midsection. After years of P90X, I didn't quite achieve a 6-pack, but I did get a nice 4-ish pack; I still had to flex a little to see it on my skinny frame, though.  Now: I feel like I'd like to gain some muscle mass. I've read from various sites, including this StackExchange, that when adding calories to fuel muscle growth (along with exercise, of course), it is inevitable that you will add some fat, i.e. your gained weight cannot be 100% muscle.  Question: I plan on ramping up my caloric intake, perhaps in 100 calorie increments, while doing a muscle growth-themed workout (Body Beast). How can I know whether I'm getting sufficient calories to fuel muscle growth? Although I cannot avoid some gain in fat, I would like to minimize it, which is why I am trying increasing my calories in 100 calorie increments.  Also, what would be the long-term (weeks/months) effect of performing a muscle growth-themed workout without ingesting sufficient calories?  (Btw, I know gaining muscle mass is a years-long endeavor; i.e. though I'm doing Body Beast, I know to not expect drastic changes in 90 days) "
2355,"How can I reconcile the need for rest with ""greasing the groove"" on pull ups?","I'm currently doing Stronglifts 5x5, and I've read a lot of material about strength training. Everything I've read so far indicates that sufficient rest is essential to making progress and building strength. All the reputable lifting routines prescribe ""rest days"". Stronglifts and Starting Strength both say not to work out more than 3 times per week.  The theory as I understand it, is that your muscles break down and weaken after you use them strenuously, and then ""bounce back"" over time. If you time your workouts right, you can train during a period where your muscles are overcompensating for the damage you've done, and you'll get a boost to your next workout. But if you train too soon, your muscles won't have recovered from the damage done, and you'll just be tearing them down again, preventing progress.  Ok, sounds reasonable. But here's where I get confused. I've been looking into ways to train myself to do pull-ups and chin-ups. At present, I can not do even one rep. One method that gets mentioned a lot is ""greasing the groove"" or ""greasing the bar"". Some people advocate putting a pull-up bar in a doorway in a frequently-used part of your house, and doing one rep every time you pass it. Other people suggest doing a certain amount of reps (or attempts) every single day, or at least every workout, until one is able to do a few pull-ups.   Based on the anecdotal evidence I've seen, ""greasing the groove"" sounds like it works. But how could that be? If I'm straining my muscles doing negative pull-ups or negative chin-ups, and I'm doing a rep here-and-there throughout the day, every day, when would my muscles have time to recover? Wouldn't it be the same as if I were doing squats or bench pressing every single day - overtraining and preventing progress? How is it possible that rest days are important for some exercises, but constant every-day effort would work for chin-ups/pull-ups? Can these two lines of thought be reconciled? "
2356,Calories consumed on workout days vs. off days,"I've read this post but I'm still a bit confused.

My workout schedule looks like:  Monday: full body Tuesday: cardio Wednesday: full body Thursday: off Friday: full body Saturday: off Sunday: off  Should my calorie consumption look like:  Monday: 2500 calories Tuesday: 2500 calories Wednesday: 2500 calories Thursday: 2000 calories Friday: 2500 calories Saturday: 2000 calories Sunday: 2000 calories  assuming that I burn approximately 500 calories during the workout/cardio days?

2359,help me adapt the bizzy diet to my needs,"This question is specifically about the bizzy diet. But I guess it could pertain to any other diet.  My goal is to lose the 8 kgs of mostly fat I've accumulated all over my body the past year. I want to go back to the 12% body fat I had when I used to be a swimmer/cyclist. A gist of the diet is:   Workout A - Upper Body Workout B - Lower Body   And every week you do Workout A, then B then A then rest a few days.  The workouts go like this in a circuit:   HIIT cardio 20 mins Some weights Cardio 10 mins Some more weights   All in a circuit.  My problem :   I only have a pool for the Cardio Besides dumbells I don't have a gym. (I know how it sounds but unfortunately it will be this way for a month)   My question :   Exercise  Can I change it up a little where I do a resistance circuit from the Nike Training App, it goes like this for 30 mins:  1 min light jog  1 min high knee runs  1 min recovery  1 min alternating ball pushups 2 min of squat jumps 2 min ski jump to cross back lunge ... ... Final 8 mins is stretching     AND then immediately I go do the HIIT in the pool?  OR should I look at the Workouts and replace them with upper and lower body workouts that do no need equipment?   I already do yoga 2-4 times a week in the morning before work.  Diet  I know how important diet is, but here again I'm in pickle. I will have to buy cooked food from outside for some time (1-2 weeks). I have all the supplements listed.  For lunch and dinner I'll have cooked veggies (indian style, so spicy) And boiled eggs.

2360,How can I tell I'm not weight-lifting hard enough?,"I'm lifting weight in order to improve my physical appearance.   But I'm unsure whether I'm doing enough or not enough. Can I use the soreness of my muscle to gauge? The advice is somewhat contradictory-- on one hand it's a myth to say It’s not a good workout unless you’re sore the next day, on the other hand it is said that you have to be a little uncomfortable during and after working out.   So which is which? how can I tell whether I'm weight-lifting hard or not hard enough? How do I know that the amount of strength training that I do is ""just enough"" to maintain my physical appearance, or it is actively improving it? "
2361,How should one land when diving in Ultimate?,"When diving/""laying out""/""bidding"" in Ultimate, should you land on your chest or on your side?   This awesome set of progressions for learning to bid in Ultimate uses the WikiHow recommendation of landing on the chest. This seems strange for several reasons: our lady players might run into trouble with it, our more rotund recreational players might run into trouble with it, and landing on your chest knocks the wind out of you. Not to mention, landing on your chest with your arm(s) extended doesn't give you any option to roll that I can see.  This totally anecdotal account emphasizes landing on your side. This jives with everything I've learned about falling in grappling sports, as well as my personal experience in Ultimate: landing on your side allows you to roll, doesn't know the wind out of you, and gives you a hair more reach.  Chest-landing and side-landing are both obviously in use, but which one is best along the criteria of A) most effective and B) safest? Are there other tactical considerations I am missing? (Opinions from Ultimate players are valued, opinions from elite players are super-valued.) "
2362,Deadlifts and squats with hyperlordosis?,"Im 22 years old, 170cm, ~90kh weight, starting some efforts to get in shape. Im going to the gym 3 times a week, trying to stay in a 6-10 rep per set range, changed my diet to low-carb, trying to put in some swimming and Tabata-style interval running (cant manage the 10-20 rest/work proportion yet, going with 30-10 for now)  I have a moderately mild case of hyperlordosis and hyperkyphosis. This is probably due to a VERY sedetary lifestyle (work, university, personal projects - all of this requires sitting at a desk for long hours)  Even though the primary goal of my workouts is lowering my BF%, I was hoping that in the process I could strengthen my back and thus help myself sit in proper position and correct my posture a bit.  As far as i know, hyperlordosis is caused by an imbalance between the posterior chain and the abs. So my question is - is doing deadlifts and squats bad for me and my back? Should I be cutting on the intensity and/or amount of those exericses? Or maybe it will be enough to put additional focus on leg rises, crunches and similar exercises? Are there any other exercises i should focus on?  Also, for the hyperkyphosis, isnt it exactly the same case, but for the chest muscles and the upper back? Are bench presses bad for me and rowing great? "
2363,Best information to keep in a exercise journal and how to keep it,"My main focus is on weight lifting - the big five: deadlift, squat, press, bench and row - I also add in accessory exercises and try (really I do) to get 1-2 cardio workouts in.    My current approach to keeping a journal is writing down what my daily workout routine was, the temp, what I ate prior/during and how I felt afterwards.  I'm following Wendler's 5/3/1 program - currently on 15 months of it (really getting great results).    My question: is there a better way to track my workouts than a notebook and pen - I tried various phone apps and they all take more time/effort than the notebook.  I'd like to be able to view progress, mine temps, subjective info I track, etc.......any ideas? I will need to be portable, easy to use, able to be in the very cold, withstand a drop, etc........  Also - what information should I keep? "
2364,What is the optimal heart rate in the rest phase of high intensity interval training?,"I am doing HIIT running. I push myself to 85-90% of my maximum heart rate in the high intensity interval. In the rest phase, my heart rate usually stays high for a while, then quickly drops. I jog between the intervals. What is the optimal heart rate for the rest phase? Or in other words, what should be my heart rate when I start the next high intensity interval? "
2365,Elbow grinding sensation after starting workout,"First up, I know there are any elbow noise questions out there, but they do not describe my experience completely.  Okay so I'm 18 yrs old and very skinny with little muscle, and I started gym a month ago.  So 2-3 weeks ago, I started getting this creaky grinding sensation when I completely extend my arm or completely bend it, you can't hear it out loud, just feel it by putting your fingers on the elbow, this sound is different from the knuckle pop or knee crack etc, its much more gentler.  I do not feel any kind of pain or secondary symptoms like swelling or locked range of motion.  When I told my trainer about it, he said its completely normal and happens because the muscle around my elbows are weak(indeed).  The sound when extending comes from a little right of the inner side of the elbow(not ulnar nerve) but when bending its kinda like from the middle of the inner elbow.  Ps.- Ever since I joined, I've been told to do wrist curls with a barbell, earlier barbell alone, then 2.5KG plates each side and currently 5kg each side. I do 100 reps of this with little rest in between.  So could it be due to this exercise? my left arm is non dominant and thus relatively weaker.  So should I stop doing these wrist exercises or just keep doing the and fortify my elbow muscles? since there is no pain or discomfort in the elbow itself while doing it. "
2366,Use of hot belts for weight loss,"There are a lot of hot belt available in the market which claims that by wearing such belt one can loose weight  and make himself good looking and physically fit by  pressing abdomen in. They explain that as one wear hot belt it rapidly caused sweating, in this way  these hot belts lost calories and fatness around our body. Before buying this hot belt I want to ask is these belts produce same results as it is told on media.Is there any side effects of these hot belt on our health??? "
2367,Is HIIT really even a good recommendation for people who aren't acclimated to cardio?,"My question is really general and doesn't pertain to any one specific individual but seeing the question about the Bizzy diet on here makes me question. Its workout plans instructs individuals to perform high intensity interval training to 'melt the fat'. But, can HIIT even be performed effectively by people who haven't practiced any cardio at all in a long time? Say a couch potato who has only lifted weights and never actually run? Situations like that. "
2368,What strength programs have been used by elite grapplers?,"How do elite judo players, Brazilian jiu-jitsu fighters, and wrestlers develop their strength? I am interested in their conditioning as well--running and the like--but primarily in resistance work. I am using this question as research for my own training goals, so my progress and training needs are not relevant. (In other words, I am not asking how I as a judo player should develop strength.)  I will answer my own question, but I know my answer is incomplete. What other lifting programs have national- or world-class grapplers used? (Details such as the development, history, scheduling and success of the programs would be helpful in understanding them.)  I'm interested in commentary about the efficacy of these workouts only relating to their performance in competition or first-hand experience. So if a wrestling team was doing OK, then started training kettlebells and won the Olympics, that's good to know. If a judoka won the World Championships then started training Olympic lifts and gassed at their next tournament, that's good to know. If the athlete, coach, or member of the athlete's team says something in an interview about how effective they found CrossFit for their grappling, that's relevant. Opinions about workout techniques or programs in general are less relevant to this question. "
2369,Combining HIIT and weight training,"Im 22 years old, 170cm, ~90kh weight, starting some efforts to get in shape. Im going to the gym 3 times a week, I changed my diet to low-carb. My main objective is to lower my BF%, but i wouldnt mind gaining some muscle mass and functional strength. Im trying to get to the 10-15 BF% range in a year (currently around 30-35BF%) and get in reasonable shape (strength, endurance etc)  While in the gym, i usually do some lat pulldowns, deadlifts, squats, benchpresses, shoulder presses, cable rows, hamstring curls. Im trying to stay in a 6-10 rep per set range.  Now, Id like to throw in some conditioning to my workout plan, so that I can for example run for a bus or swim a bit without panting or gasping for air. I thought that adding in some swimming and interval sprinting would be the best way to do that.  Still, Im a bit concerned about spoiling my gym workouts and overtraining.   Yesterday i tried some Tabata style training and managed to do 8 sets of 10sec sprint 30sec walk, and it felt good, and I can feel the effects today - my whole legs ""know"" they got a nice workout. But today is my gym day, and im wondering, if the usual squat/deadlifiting/lunges is a good idea?  When I went to the pool a few days ago, I found swimming pretty exhausting. 16 25m lapses was the best I could do, taking breaks every 3 lapses (or even after every one, depending on if it was breaststroke or backstroke) and i was panting hevaily. Isnt such swimming undermining my gym efforts to buff up my muscle mass and metabolism? Should I tone it down and make it a bit more splish-splashy playing around, just to have some low intensity movement and exercise? Think a walk in the park instead of a jog or dedicated running.  So, to make my questions clear and separate them from background info:   Can I put interval sprinting into my workout routine without hindering my weight lifting efforts? If so, should I do it on rest days, or the same days as I go to the gym? How often can I do the sprinting? Can I include swimming into my routine without hindering the rest? How intense should the swimming be?     note: I read the Overtraining my legs doing both cardio and leg workouts question, but it didnt really have all the answers I was looking for "
2370,Cola Zero: What are the effects,"Bascially you gain weight if you intake more calorie than what you actually burn.  So, if I take cola zero, which has 1 kcal per can, does that make me fat or gain weight?  What are the disadvantages? "
2371,Can you calculate % of V02 max at which you're working using pulse ox readings?,"Can you calculate % of V02 max at which you're working (assuming it's >100%) by measuring change in blood oxygenation with a pulse ox?  My understanding is that working at >100% VO2 max means you're not absorbing enough oxygen to fully re-oxygenate your arterial blood (ie going hypoxic, which, I believe, is what a pulse ox is often used to detect). It would seem, then, that by measuring the rate at which your blood oxygen level is decreasing, that ""oxygen deficit"" could be quantified.  Am I missing something? Would this actually be feasible? (I don't have any sense of how much blood oxygenation level would change and how sensitive/accurate the readings are from a pulse ox)  Thanks!  Edit  What first got me curious about this question was trying to experiment with the original Tabata HIIT regimen (the ""IE1 protocol"": 8 intervals of 20s at 170% VO2 max, followed by 10s of rest). I realize that actually paying attention to readings during the exercise is likely unfeasible, but was wondering if looking at pulse ox data after the fact could give a sense of whether the intensity goals were met. "
2372,Strengthening neck and shoulders to hold weight on my head,"I practice lion dance as part of the tradition and culture of my martial arts system. It is a dance in which two performers mimic a lion's movements inside a costume. As part of some lion dance routines (in general), various tricks can be performed with two people.  There is one particular trick where I lift a person (the one holding the lion head) up by the waist and onto my head. Lifting the person up with the lion head is not particularly difficult for me. Maintaining the weight after setting the person down on my head tends to put stress on my neck and shoulders, and more so when I walk around, as I try to keep my posture and not collapse.  Here is a picture that resembles what I'm talking about.   lion dance - full stack Photo by Scott Swigart  I am mentally comfortable with bearing the weight on my head (from practicing over and over), but physically I feel like I still there is a limit to how long I can hold the weight. Doing it too many times also leads to much soreness. I am curious to know whether there are exercises and stretches that would allow me to build up strength in my neck and shoulders so that I could perform this move longer.  Here's one example of me and my partner doing a dance (we are in the gold lion). If you want see some really cool and impressive stuff though, check out lion dance competition videos on YouTube.  I added the ""cheerleading"" tag since it is probably the most analogous type of physical workout. Hopefully it will attract people from that area who understand what I'm describing and could provide some insight. "
2373,Should one train/test their 1RM?,"I recently watched a video of fitness youtuber talking about him testing his 1RM frequently (about every 6-8 weeks), which would replace one of his ""regular"" training days. He does that by calculating his 1RM and then trying to lift that with some friends spotting him. Unfortunatly he does not talk why he does that. I won't include the video because it is not in english and doesn't really contribute to the question itself other than giving the context of why I'm asking the question in the first place.  When training in a bodybuilding-like fashion (training for hyportrophy and gaining muscle size), should one test their 1RM frequently? If yes, why? What are the benefits of that (except maybe boosting your ego)? "
2374,What could be causing the pain in my shoulder during chest presses and pull-downs?,I experience pain in my left shoulder during wide grip lat pull-down (more when arms are in the lower part of the movement). I do wide grip pull-ups without any problems at the same time. It also hurts on pecs machine at the open position. Is it flexibility problem? Has it something to do with shoulder exercises on the previous workout? 
2375,Help standing back up from lunge position,"When I do lunges or when I run, when I have one leg in front I cannot get back into a standing position.  I have actually fallen down running because I couldn't get my leg to straighten up to move my other leg forward.  It's really hard to explain.  I do a lot of biking and have no problems with that.  I can do squats with no trouble.  I know I need to strengthen certain muscles.  When I was going to a gym the trainer was explaining how the wrong muscles were trying to do the job and the muscles that should be doing it were weak.   My questions are:    How can I strengthen the correct muscles when other muscles keep taking over?  How do I get back to a standing position when lunging or running?  "
2376,What is the genetic potential for muscular development?,"I've heard the concept of ""genetic potential"" thrown around when referring to bodybuilding. They say that people are hardwired to reach certain size. I have the following questions regarding this elusive concept.  Scientific validity  Have scientists singled out the gene that determines the genetic potential a person's muscles? Or is the concept purely based off observation from the bodybuilding community?  Plateau  How can you differentiate between hitting a plateau and hitting your genetic potential? Should a person who's been unsuccessfully trying to break a plateau for over a year give up because it's not really a plateau but rather a genetic brick wall?  Hard Limit?  Is the limit a hard limit? For example, the gene says one person's upper arm circumference will not exceed 26 inches no matter what. Or is it a ballpark limit? That is, a person will struggle to get past the suggested limit, but will have an exponentially harder time going past that limit. "
2377,Would this work for a teen looking to get lean?,"I’m a 17 year-old teen guy and I’ve been doing some research on trying to get “lean” or just generally getting fit. Currently I have a basic model based on a single plan, but I wanted some suggestions from people who know this stuff through personal experience or even better a coach. I'm doing this all at home, and aim to get a low body fat. I should also add, I'm a bit fat on the belly, my chest needs working, and the rest of my body is skinny.  Here's the workout I'm currently doing:  - Jumping Jack 30  – Pushups 25 – Situps 25  – Plank 60s  – Squat 25  – Burpee 30  Break  - Squat Press 20 – Side plank 30s each side – Pushups 25 – Situps 35 – Jumping Jack 30 – Plank 60s – Squat press 20 – Burpee 30  Stretch  - Superman 5   How effective is this workout, if not, what do I need to change? Roughly, if possible how many calories does it burn?  "
2378,How does one train for sports when the three metabolic pathways interact?,"As I understand it, there are three mechanisms by which ATP is replenished:        For intense 10-12 second efforts, ADP is directly converted back to ATP using creatine phosphate   For efforts up to a couple minutes, ATP is produced by glycolytic metabolism   For longer efforts (several minutes or many hours), ATP is produced by oxidation of fatty acids and glycolytic products      (Source is nearly verbatim from Mark Rippetoe and Lon Kilgore's Practical Programming for Strength Training, 2nd edition, page 57)  If a particular sport engages two different metabolic methods, A) how does that interaction work, and B) how does one condition for it?  For example, many running-centric team sports like soccer are clearly in the third category (running for twenty minutes to maintain positional control of the field). Those same sports occasionally require intense spurts that would clearly fall in the first category (sprinting on a breakaway).   Is sport-specific training (e.g. scrimmaging) best for training this interaction between the two pathways? Is training each pathway individually (e.g. sled drags in one workout,  distance running in another)  sufficient? Does conditioning have to be combined in the same  specific manner that mimics lower-intensity work interspersed with bursts of hard effort (e.g. Indian runs)?  Update: to be clear, I am looking for an explanation of the physical or physiological phenomena going on here. I am not looking for advice on a training regimen, unless it specifically explains why and how it is most effective, using either science or competition. "
2379,When can one say one has learnt swimming?,I am a beginner in swimming and I have been making slow and steady progress. I would love to set targets for myself so that I focus and improve.  When can one say one has surpassed the beginner stage and is an intermediate level swimmer? How much distance is an intermediate level swimmer expected to swim for different strokes? I agree it is arbitrary but rough guidelines will be helpful. 
2380,How can I change my diet and exercise routine to look like Daniel Craig?,"I started going to the gym around June/July, and so far not doing too badly.  I'm 5'7"" and currently weigh 12 and a half stone (175 lbs). Not too fat or not too skinny.  Here is my current workout:   Mondays: 20 minutes on the treadmill at 11 speed. 45mins doing resistance training on my upper body/arms Tuesdays: Same as Mondays Wednesday: Rest Thursday: 45mins resistance training on upper body and then 20mins on the treadmill, 11 speed  Friday: 45mins resistance training on upper body.  20mins treadmill at 11 speed again.   Then swimming for 30mins doing front crawl (50m non-stop, 1-2min rest, do another 50m, 10x times). Saturday: 20mins on treadmill, 45mins of resistance training, 30-40mins of swimming again, front crawl.   For resistance training I typically do this:   Chest press(50kg) Shoulder press(45kg)  Dumbbells (biceps 12.5kg, triceps 15kg).  Bench press(30kg using dumbbells of 15kg each) Lat pull downs(45/50kg).   Each exercise I do 4-6 sets of 10 reps with a 30-60second break between each rep.  Diet:   Morning:  Dried cereals, and a few oranges later in the morning Lunch:  Chicken and rice (various type, curry, filipino dishes etc etc) or pasta. Evenings: Sometimes the same chicken and rice/pasta plus sometimes steak, pork or fish dishes for dinner.   I do not take any protein shakes though.  My goal:  Develop a bit of muscle mass (Similar to Daniel Craig ;) ) whilst having healthy stamina and not being overweight.  Is there anything I can do differently to help produce more muscle mass and be more toned up? So far I don't look TOO bad, but still far off from looking like Daniel Craig.  Do I need to adjust my diet a bit? Am I taking in enough protein and do I need protein shakes? If I do need a protein shake, which one? I am allergic to dairy products and most protein shakes have dairy? "
2381,What's the time threshold for a drop in performance when taking a break from training?,"Whenever I go on vacation, the dilemma in my head is, should I try to work out there? Or just take a break from everything and resume when I get back.  The worry is that a break would cause some backward progress in strength, depending on how long the break is.  I do know that I have hit PR's on first days back at the gym after about 2 weeks of no lifting, which is awesome. But if I had waited longer, would it have been different?  I'm wondering if there is a scientifically found time period that the body can generally maintain strength levels for, after which there is a performance hit.  I'm mainly talking about this in a strength/powerlifting context, but I guess any info on the same idea with regard to general fitness (i.e. endurance/stamina, coordination) would be nice. "
2382,how to calculate calorie from pedometer?,"How can I convert pedometer steps to calories burned?  Can anybody explain this to me?  I know there is a lot of variables (sex,age,weight), but, I don't know the heart rate.  I need to know how are they calculated.  I have found this formula :     Calories burned per mile = 0.57 x 175 lbs.(your weight) = 99.75   calories per mile.   But, I know I have to measure weight, distance, time and steps. Please help me with this  Thank you! "

2384,Usage of my first protein powder (Muscle Milk),"I just started using protein powder today. I'm using Muscle Milk.  I am lactose intolerant and it doesn't bother my stomach.  This is the label of the product. It says 70 grams powder with 10 fl oz water. According to WolframAlpha, 10 fl oz = 300 ml.  But I'm not sure if this calculation is correct.  My trainer told me, ""use 1 scoop (35 grams) with 250 ml water"".  Also, checking that label, under Directions and Use, an image shows the shaker is almost full, but my shaker is 700ml. 300 ml looks too low.   Am I making a mistake while converting ""fl oz"" to ""ml""?  In short, I have Muscle Milk, how much water should I use with 2 scoops (70 grams) powder and 1 scoop (35 grams) powder?  My shaker is 700 ml.  Also, regarding usage, I'll sip 1 scoop shake while working out, and another 2 scoop shake after my workout. It's about 460 calories. Is it too much?  My goal is to burn fat, and be stronger. I'm following StrongLifts' 5x5 program, it's my 6th week. I lost 3 kgs and gained muscle. I want to keep this performance.   Any help will be greatly appreciated :) "

2390,Stability shoes causes pain when running,"I have flat feet, and I went to a store for shoes recommendation. The guy then recommended Mizuno Wave Rider and I'd been wearing that for a few years. Did a few marathon, weekly runs and so on.  As the Wave Rider was dying, I was looking for a replacement. This time round, the store told me that I'd been wearing the wrong shoes and a flat feet like me should wear Mizuno Inspire as it gives me more support. So I did, thinking the first guy made a mistake.  However, when I did the first run today, my feet hurt badly. It seemed like something was pushing the middle of my sole through out the run, and I couldn't even complete my run.  Is it normal for runners to feel like this when they change to a support/stability shoes? I don't really have any problem with Wave Rider, but the store said it will be bad for my knee, that's why I decided to change. Did I make a bad move? "

2392,How well do severe under pronators cope with barefoot shoes?,"Has anyone with a high arch switched to barefoot shoes? If so, how far are you able to run in them? Have you felt pain in your knees? Does the arch of your foot feel like it has been over-stretched?  My concern:  If I choose to run in a 'neutral' shoe I will feel pain in my knees when I run over 10km. The cartilage rubs together on the outside of my knee and boy does it hurt. I switched to some mizuno wave riders and put in some arch insoles and ran some 10k's, half marathons and a marathon with no pain at all in my knees. Now I am interested in trying out some barefoot shoes, probably some from vivobarefoot or a similar brand,  but I am worried that I will again feel pain in my knees because of my arches. Since I have found a pair of shoes that eliminate my knee problems, I am hesitant to try something new. "
2393,What books or online resources are available for someone wanting to move to a vegan diet?,"I just finished reading The China Study, which piqued my interest in veganism for the first time, after years of thinking vegetarians were usually a little silly, and vegans were especially silly.  Can anyone (especially experienced vegans or vegetarians) point me to books or online resources to help me as I start this journey?  There is a plethora of vegan and vegetarian cook books on Amazon.  I'm interested in something a bit more than that.  Of course I recognize that having at least one vegan cook book will be essential, but I feel like I want more information about this lifestyle first.  Some of the types of questions I would like to have answered are:   Should I quit meat/dairy/eggs cold-turkey (cold-tofurkey?)? Or is it easier to ""ease"" my way into my new diet? Am I likely to experience physical symptoms when I change my diet? Feelings of hunger? Weakness? Stomach pains? Cravings? Anything else? Should I consult a doctor before/during/after the change of diet? Are there any gotchas I need to be aware of when grocery shopping or dining out, to be sure I'm ordering things on (or at least a close as possible to) my new diet? What do I need to take into account to ensure that I am eating a complete diet? Once I'm on my new diet, will I suffer physically if I break the diet occasionally, and eat meat/cheese/etc if that's all I have available? And of course, recipes will be helpful. But again, I think this will be the easy part to answer.  "
2394,Distributing workout throughout day,"Let's say my workout for a given day includes 3 sets of squats, 3 sets of bench press and 3 sets of rows. Usually, one would do this in a 45 minute workout. Alternatively, I could spread out the exercises and sets over the duration of a full day.  Would one approach be more effective than another? Is work work? Or is there an intensity component? "
2395,Fitness/Strength Program for return to sport,"Background on me:  I am 28 years old. I weigh 205 pounds (92 kg) and I am 6 feet tall (1.82m). Not sure what my BMI or fat % is but I am quite muscular but with a bit of fat. More than I'd like on my belly. Currently I'm quite strong but also quite unfit.   I last played hurling (think a cross between lacrosse and ice hockey) about 7 years ago. I intend to begin playing again in about 5 months time. As you can imagine I am not as fit as I was then. I have exercised on and off for the last 7 years, running and free weights, but not with great consistency, but just enough to stay barely in shape.  Now that I intend to start playing hurling again I want to get as fit and strong as I can before I start back in 5 months. I was hoping that I could get some advice on a program that I could follow to build strength and explosive fitness but not to completely ignore endurance fitness.  I have been doing the following for the last few weeks:  Mon: AM: Weights (Bench, pullups, dumbell press, one arm row, dumbell flyes, seated rows)  Mon: PM: Spin class  Tues: Treadmill (start off with comfortable job and increase speed every 5 mins)  Wed: Weights(Shoulder press, bicep bar curls, upright row, close grip bench press, front and lat raises, tricep extensions, dumbell curl)  Thurs: AM: Treadmill (start off with comfortable job and increase speed every 5 mins)  Thurs: PM: Spin class  Fri: Weights(Squat, leg press, leg extension, hamstring curl, calf raises)  Sat: Rest  Sun: Rest  For the weights I have been doing 3 sets of 8 reps. Lifting as heavy as I can for these reps.  Does this program look ok for someone wishing to build muscle and strength, and to build up a good level of fitness? Hurling requires a good level of overall fitness so I dont want to ignore this.  Are there any good programs out there for sports like these? "
2396,Fitness app advice?,"StackExchange,  I'm new here and have spent the past hour searching the site for potential answers to my question, to no avail. I did find this list of fitness apps: Creating a compendium of fitness and nutrition apps?  However, it doesn't quite get at what I'm asking, so I'll try to explain the situation.   I'm a fit individual, who works out 5-6 times a week with kettlebells, barbell weightlifting and bodyweight exercises.   What I find difficult is putting together my programming instead of just showing up and working out. For example, this morning I decided I would do kettlebell exercises, but I threw together a workout on the fly. In contrast, Monday, Thursdays and Saturdays I do Stronglifts with my girlfriend, which leaves my no wiggle room for throwing something together on the fly, but achieves definable results.  I'm looking for an app that can put together the disparate pieces of my workout puzzle and prescribe me a program that will help to achieve my goals.  After looking at most of the apps that exist, it seems that there are a) encyclopedic apps with a ton of exercises but terrible UX, or b) really gimmicky 7-minute booty burner workouts that I wouldn't touch with a ten foot pole.  Does anyone here have recommendations for something similar to what I'm talking about?

2397,Rest after workout,How long is the duration for which we are required to rest after workout. Is it good to do 2-3 sessions of heavy workout every day? What should be the rest period between the two sessions.  I take 1 gm of proteins per pound of body weight. How I am I supposed to keep up my energy if duration of both sessions is 100 minutes? 
2398,How much and why will my muscle mass slow me down in the different running categories?,"Assuming that bodyfat% remains low (6-15%), how does having a lot of muscle mass affect performance in sprinting-type events (50m-400m), middle distance runs (800m-5K) and endurance runs (10K-100K)?  I have read quite some articles stating that strength training helps improve running performance, since more strength means that taking a step requires less %force output of your 1RM it is now possible to run longer and/or faster. It's also not true that strength training only works your type II muscle fibers (which aren't used that much in endurance runs). It actually strengthens your type I fibers aswell.  I've also read that neuromuscular efficiency tends to reach near-maximal state fairly soon in a resistance program (beginner stage, around 140kg 1rm proper depth squat according to stronglifts.) In order to see further reasonable strength gains, it is said that you have to increase your muscle mass. Therefore, assuming that one is fairly proficient with the big compound lifts, the most important factor in strength differences should be muscle mass.  So since muscle mass is very heavily related to strength, and strength gains improve running performance, does muscle mass really slow me down in running? "
2399,Workout Frequency and Tempo for Bodybuilding?,"I'm trying to do some work out to gain mass and muscles. In order to develop muscles and gain weight:   Is it better to do full body workouts day after day or do specific muscle groups every day (monday chest, tuesday legs ...)?  Is it better to do workouts with heavy weights or light ones?  Is it better to do many sets with few reps or few sets with many reps?  Should I do the exercises rapidly or slowly?   "

2401,How to focus at the gym?,"Lately i am having trouble focusing on my weight exercises.  I don't really know how to explain it, but i have the feeling that the exercises i do are not having their effect, because i am not focused. In the gym there is always music, people coming and going... sometimes i feel disturbed and cant really concentrate on my training.  Would you like to share with me some of the techniques you use to concentrate or focus, when you are at the gym?  How do you manage to clear your mind and do things correctly with no hurry? "
2402,How can I structure going to the gym twice per day?,"I have been going to the gym for almost 3 months now, focusing on gaining size. I have been going 5 nights per week (Sunday, Monday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday) and have noticed good gains, especially in my arms, chest, back and legs. I have gained roughly 4kg, bringing me to 70kg (154 pounds).  I haven't made major changes to what I eat, though I have been making the effort to have breakfast every day (previously didn't) and have invested heavily in high quality proteins such as Utilmate ISO Mass Xtreme Gainer. With that said, I do get at least a large serving of vegetables per day and don't eat anything obviously bad (like fast food, chips, chocolates, etc).  I also haven't done much cardio, because from what I've read or heard that will reduce my gains.  I'm putting all that I can into my goal which is to get quite big and then next year this time shred down. I want to go as far as I possibly can to gain quickly and effectively, so I've thought about going to the gym twice per day now. What I have realized though is I don't know what I should do in the mornings; whether it's some type of pure strength building workouts (like cross-fit style aimed purely at getting stronger), cardio and core, or just more weight lifting.  The latter seems most appealing for my goal, but I'm not confident that lifting weights twice per day will be beneficial. I'm also finding it hard to include a morning weight session in my weekly routine without getting the feeling that I'm just going to wear myself out for that night, or the next day.  Pure strength training sounds more appealing because I figure that will lead to me being able to lift heavier and thus gain more quickly, but I'm not sure if that's how that works either. A lot of the strength training stuff also seems quite cardio heavy and again I don't want to take away from my gains.  Is it worthwhile going to the gym twice per day, or even just going in the morning two or three times per week? If so, what can I do there to best compliment my goal of getting big? I was also wondering if I could even just do cardio and core (to get abs as well) without affecting my gains too much, considering I will still be doing those weight sessions as per current 5 times each week.

2403,How to keep stamina for intense long duration workouts,"I am a hard core gymer. I work out 2hrs a day at a single stretch. However I am unable to keep the intensity of the workouts halfway. I mean not being able to maintain the vigour and stamina with which I began. Currently I am working out for weight gain and lifting heavyweights so I warmup for 8 -10 minutes. Its  cold winters here in haryana,  india. Can you suggest ways in improving my stamina? Is there some thing I should do to improve stamina or take certain supplements before working out? Will taking lot of carbs before working out really help?? "
2404,Foot and calves pain when running,"I know there seem to be a lot of similar questions, but most are about pain on the top of the foot. Mine is located on the inside of both feet when I run.  Here's my situation. I am extremely overweight (honestly I weigh around 290 for 6'0) and I have very flat feet. I did go and buy good shoes with thick gel soles (is that the right word? had to translate). The pain occurs only when I run after about 700m and quite rapidly wears off when I stop running. After my jog I feel no pain afterwards so I don't think I'm injured (yet). I also have the same pain in my calves but the foot pain is worse and makes me have to stop running even though I could still run.  Is this a matter of being overweight and having flat feet? Will losing weight make it better, and will I injure myself if I continue to run? "
2405,Which is the right way of doing Siddhasana?,"In this video Sadhguru speaks about Siddhasana and says ""there is a point  on the left heel that today medical sciences are calling it as the Achilles"" and after some time he says ""you put your Achilles to what is called as muladhara or the perineum in your body"".  Now see the image human foot anatomy.      All these days I was putting heel bone(calcaneus) to perineum for doing siddhasana. But here Sadhguru says Achilles. Which is the right thing?   Is he calling the hell itself Achilles tendon?   Or the image is wrong?(this less probable as there re many images in google showing the anatomy this way)   Or does Achilles tendon extends till the middle of the heel? As its called calcaneal tendon and the heel bone is called calcaneus.   Or is the Achilles exactly present at the place where its marked in the image? if so how do you put it to perineum? And this also contradicts Sadhguru as he says ""there is point on left heel""  Note: As yoga is not so popular in fitness stack exchange community, I have also asked the same question in Quora: [website]"
2406,What's the deal with arch support?,"Arch support in a shoe seems to be important these days.  I recently read an opinion that Vibram five-fingers shoes might not be as good as once thought, partially due to lack of arch support.  People used to run and do all activities without shoes.  Even recently, Converse (presumably without arch supports, same as today) were an official shoe for things like basketball.  Our feet are not formed with shoes in mind.  Shoes were an afterthought.  So, why is arch support so important?  Is it because our feet have become accustomed to them and are now incapable of safely walking / running 'the natural way'?  Is it a marketing gimmick?  Or something else? "
2407,Will this workout build strong muscles for an intermediate bodybuilder?,"So if I go to the gym 5 days a week and do this sort of workout with about 1700 calories a day, healthy diet with a mesomorph bodytype and about 8.5 hours of sleep each night, will this routine build your muscles up a lot stronger?

2408,Trying to stop being skinny and gain muscle,"Basically, I am a 15 year old boy, 5f 11"". I weight about 10st/140lb/63.5kg.  For the last month I have been exercising by just doing random push ups/sit ups throughout the day (roughly 100 push ups and 200 sit ups). I can do Sit Ups in groups of 40 and Push Ups in groups of 20-25. I know that just doing two different things isn't very effective, so I need an actual routine. The summer holidays are coming up for me (its my last day tomorrow) and in these 6 weeks I am wanting to spend more time on it.  So basically, what kind of routine should I be doing? I just want to increase my upper body strength. I can spend money on dumbbells etc (I want to buy dumbbells, but I'm really not sure what weights I should get, I was thinking 5kg or 10kg)  Also, what should I be eating? As I'm 14 I can't really control my diet, but I eat a lot (more than you would expect, I have a good metabolism though so I have virtually no body fat), and lately I never have anything sweet and I skip any puddings. I have always been more of a healthier person, always having my 5 a day in just fruit that I eat. My mum/dad cook healthy homemade meals.

2409,Gluteus Medius doesn't feel like it is doing the work?,"I'm currently trying to train my gluteus medius in order to provide a more stable stance while squatting. My knees feel kind of wobbly while doing such motions and I read that this would help.  To train this muscle, I do lateral leg raises while lying on my side. For each leg individually, in total I do 2-3 sets of about 10 reps 2 times a week, depending on how I feel that day. For my right leg, after a few reps I really feel my gluteus medius working and firing (the usual muscle burn you get when going to failure). However with my left leg, I don't feel my gluteus medius working at all, even not after 15 or 20 reps. I know it is likely that one side/leg is a little stronger than the other but this huge difference seems kind of unusal to me.  Also when performing the exercise with my left leg, I feel some sort of stretch in the back of my knee, which also extends towards the region of my hamstrings and calfs.  I'd also like to state that I'm doing the exercise motion exactly the same with both legs, which my training partner double checked too.  Now my question is, what can I do about this difference in the legs? Is this a normal thing to experience? I'd like to feel my gluteus medius working on both legs instead of feeling a stretch in the left one. "
2410,Always running out of energy when running,"I'd love to get some advice on this one.   tl;dr:   I can't figure out my calorie intake, and often end up dying in the middle of my 5k runs.   The longer version:   I've been running since August-ish, and have been trying to three 5k runs per week. In the last month I've gone from 32min down to 27:40. (That's just a bit of background).  About 50% of the time, I'll get 3/4 of the way through a run and completely run out of gas. And I mean completely. It's extremely frustrating—one day I'll have a good run, and the next, I'll be ready to pass out after about 20 minutes of running.   Here's what I had to eat today:   7am:  Toast and peanut butter, coffee  10:30: apple, banana, coffee  11:30: a good-sized turkey sandwich  12:00  a granola bar  12:40 Run  Today, I got to about 22 minutes of fairly moderate pace and thought I was going to have to be carried back. I was dead. I didn't have a thing left.   The only runs where I find that this doesn't happen are my night runs — when I run after dinner (about 7:30-8pm). I find these runs go just fine when I eat by 5:30 and run after 7:30.   Any suggestions on how I might sort out my daytime running issues? An apple, a banana, a big turkey sandwich and a granola bar should be enough to fuel an 'easy' day run, shouldn't it?   Thanks for any ideas!  ps:  I'm 6'2, about 200lbs. In 'reasonable' shape.  Update: So it seems like it's almost certainly a pacing issue. I've had 4 quite good runs now with no out-of-gas issues. I ran last friday on very little food, but watched my pace meticulously and had no issue. I didn't post a fast time, for sure, but I didn't run out of gas.   So the 'trick' to getting better at running is really improving your 'conversational pace'? When I started, I couldn't maintain a conversation at any pace, but now I can run for 30mins straight and be conversational the whole time. Again, not with a fast time, but I my heart rate isn't going nuts. I presume that with 6-8+ weeks of this, my 'conversational pace' will be faster? Is that how this works?   At any rate, thanks everyone for helping me sort this out. It seems obvious to me now, but it was quite a mystery before! Thanks! "
2411,What are default weight ratios for different Crossfit exercises?,"I am doing Crossfit for couple monthes and still can't manage to always find a good weight for training according to weight exercises. For instance, I can do deadlifts with 60 kg and front squat with 50 kg, but thrusters with only 40 kgs, while won't be able to do power snatch even with 40 kgs. Recently, my coach adviced me to take 30 kg on thrusters since ""that's an intensive exercise, not strength exercise; better take less weight, but do more reps"". So, the question is what is an expected relative weights table? How do you know which weight to take for every exercise except for remembering ""my"" value for every exercise and reps number. Trying different weights doesn't work well, because this value changes with time and progress.  As for me, I currently use then next ""formula"" (of course, approximately):  x * reps coefficient * exercise coefficient   where x is currently 60 kg (actually 1 RM Deadlift) and it changes while I progress.   Reps in round    Coefficient 1-2              1.0 (doesn't change) 3-6              0.9 (-10%) 7-10             0.75 (-25%) 11+              0.5 (-50%)  Exercise         Coefficient Deadlift         1.0 (doesn't change) FS, BS           0.8 (-20%) Squat clean      0.75 (-25%) Pushes / Jerks   0.75 (-25%) Power clean      0.7 (-30%) Thruster         0.7 (-30%) OH squat         0.6 (-40%) Power snatch     0.5 (-50%)   So, if I see ""xxx rounds, 5 rep each, power cleans"", I currently take 60 * 0.9 * 0.7 ~= 35-40 kg, according to my physical and mental state, and WOD intensity / rounds count. Or when I see ""Power snatch 3 reps EMOM"", I would take 60 * 0.5 * 0.9 ~= 25-30 kg. When I manage to make deadlifts with 70 kg, I will recalculate weights for all other exercises. I will also increase coefficient if I improve my technique - for instance, recently power snatch coefficient was 0.35, because I couldn't do it very well.  Of course, it is very individual, but what are the general averages and ideas? What weight are you taking for every exercise? I would also be happy to use this information to understand which exercises I am bad at, and what should I work on more often. "
2412,"Max reps, boredom and carpet-burn","Is there any consensus on the maximum number of reps you should perform, before rotating?   Curious as I find I get bored, or start to get say carpet burn (sit-ups), if the number exceeds a hundred. Personally I choose not to do more than 60 of anything, also find 60 a useful number for timing. Then again, back in my student days, I've had house mates who'd happily do 500 push-ups, immediately rotate into 1,000 sit-ups, then on to many squats, as a warm up, before throwing up last night bottle of Vodka over the nearest parked car (learnt were not to park), so I guess it's entirely personal/subjective, but is there any general advice?

2413,Why am I stronger in isometrics?,"I can only curl with one arm 21 kilograms once, this is my maximum but I can hold at 90° degrees 30 kilograms for for up to 2 minutes then my arm starts to shake too much.   So I'm clearly immensely stronger in isometrics, both in terms of raw power and endurance. Why is it so?   Does the fact that can use heavier weights for more volume make isometric training superior for muscle growth?  "
2414,Thumbs up push ups muscles worked,"I watch the AthleanX youtube channel a lot to learn a lot about the body's mechanical working as well as any training tips. In one video, Jeff recommends thumbs up push ups as a no equipment work out for the back. But I can't figure out how it would work. I am sure he is right, as I have learned a huge amount from his videos.  The closest back exercise that I know of that I can compare it to would probably be a straight arm pushdown, but it is still pushing away from the body on the horizontal plane instead of vertical, like the pushdown.   He doesn't say what muscles it might work, and I can't figure it out. Does anybody understand the mechanics of it? "
2415,Body fat loss halted. Anyone have experience getting under 8% body fat?,"I have successfully reduced my body fat from 15% to 8.5%. Keep in mind these are pinch tests so the over all body fat calculated percentage might be a bit off. My abdominal skin fold measures 7.1mm.   I eat 3000 calories a day and whenever I try reduce this, I lose muscle (which results in an identical or worsened overall body fat percentage). Its almost as if my body doesn't want to lose any more fat.   I don't do ANY cardio - just hard &amp; heavy (to me at least) weight training 4 or 5 times a week. What cardio should I try putting in (assuming that will get me down)? Anyone tried and had success with intermittent fasting?  I'm ALMOST happy with my physique. I would hate to come all this way and not achieve a full shredded physique. Here is a picture. You can see that blob of fat where the bottom 2 abs should be.    "
2416,Varying Rep Ranges During a Workout,"My question is...Is my work out routine useful for mass or is it completely wrong?  For quite a while, I followed a routine where I would start with  3 or 4 sets of a tough excercise and heavy weights I could rep maybe just six times each set. Then on the next excercise of 3 or 4 sets I would move to medium weight I could rep at least eight times each set. Last, I would do 3 or 4 sets of a lighter excercise with omething like 12 reps on each set. For example, for chest I would go heavy on the bench, then do the medium weights with dumbell presses and then finish with peck deck.  I know that there are supposedly optimal rep ranges for mass and I was maybe slightly stepping out of that optimal range on either end of the workout, but I somehow had this idea that I need to go really heavy while I am still full of energy at the beginning and take the muscles to their strength limit (still within something we could consider a mass building rep range), then the middle I would consider the golden core of the workout and the lighter weights at the end I would consider something like a pump up excercise.  I know some people go exactly the opposite way and start lighter and increase loads as they go, but I just find I get exhausted too early on some easy stuff and the when I need to really work, I am half dead already.  Generaly there are tons of different load progression methods...but could anyone give me a qualified answer as to what is really good? (again my priority is mass) Thanks "
2417,Does not eating fat reduce my chances of getting fat?,"If I don't eat fat, and eat only other things, for example protein and vitamins, then does this reduce my chances of getting fat? In other words, I will never be fat even if I don't do exercise? "

What is the best way to recover from a long bike ride (stretching?, eating certain foods?, other ideas?) to minimize pain and soreness. "
2419,Womans Abdominal issues,"I've had 2 kids, neither recently. My 2nd pregnancy caused extreme weight gain and severe stretch marks on the lowest part of my abdomen, between the belly button n the pubic bone and between both hips with the most severe ones closest to the bottom n the sides.   I lost the extra weight and my stomach never got back to looking normal.   I personally think it's because of the stretched skin even though some ""fitness buff"" friends of mine say it's not possible to not be able to get my stomach back to normal. Genetically I was predisposed to stretching and I've since learned that there were some deficiencies that probably attributed to it.   I have gained some weight and its filled out the saggy skin but I now have an extra roll under the more common bottom pouch. When I tighten my stomach muscles it lifts and pulls the fat and skin making it look better, not good just better and it's actually a noteworthy difference.   What can I do to get that to be permanent? Are there certain muscles that I could target?   Secondly, the extra roll, it's so close to my pubic area that it's very embarrassing. Even getting back to my prepregnancy weight didn't eliminate it so I'm wondering if the only option is going to be a tummy tuck for that?   I'd like to hear I could get rid of it on my own because I do not want to have plastic surgery. I wear Spanks on a regular basis but I'm too embarrassed to get in a bathing suit, even the tummy control ones don't work well enough.   Any advice on where I should start and what I can expect would be greatly appreciated! "
2420,Should you really work on your legs the most?,"Since your legs are the biggest muscle group on your body, should they be worked more than the rest of the body? And should the chest and shoulders be the most worked on upper body becuase they are the most major muscles there? "
2421,Should one replace burned calories?,"Question: Should you replace calories burned after exercise (specifically when you already take exercise levels into account while calculating your food goals)?  Example: I calculate my food/macro-nutrient goals by calculating my BMR using my LBM and use an activity level multiplier to come up with my TDEE which I consume 80% of in order to create a calorie deficit.  Since I am 5' 9"", 150 lbs with about 16% body fat, my BMR comes out to be 1607 calories. I multiply that by 1.35 since I go to the gym five days a week to lift weights and consider that to be moderately active. That makes my TDEE equal 2169 calories. I multiply it by .8 to only take 80% of it and so, in total, I try to consume around 1735 calories.  Essentially, I want to know if I started doing cardio of some sort on any of those days (maybe high intensity interval training), would it be wise to increase my calorie intake at all if my goal is to lose weight?  Anecdote: My mom uses an app on her smartphone to track exercise and food intake. She wants to follow a consistent meal plan every week, but her app tells her after a cardio session the approximate amount of calories she's burned. She thinks she should replace all of those calories with whatever she can find, but I'm skeptical. How could one possibly plan for the exact number of calories the app is going to calculate? "
2422,Good Standing Posture Without Thinking About It,"When I am standing or walking, and thinking about something other than my posture, I exhibit a bit of lumbar hyperlordosis, a fair amount of thoracic kyphosis and a bit of forward head (both my professional and avocational pursuits involve computer use).  For about 18 months I have been working out regularly and working on stretching the hip flexors, strengthening the core, the glutes, rows, etc.  When I look in the mirror, I can engage the abdominus rectus, thrust a bit with the glutes, and put my chest up and I see a very good-looking posture.  However, when I am not thinking about it (which is 99% of the time) I regress.  I do have a standing/sitting (up/down) desk, but when I stand and I engage in a good posture consciously, then return to my work.  Invariably some time later I notice that I have allowed my belly to protrude and am resting a bunch of weight on my lumbar spine.  I then correct it.  In general, I find it easier to identify good vs. bad posture when standing vs. sitting, and when I am standing I can imitate a person who has good posture for brief periods of time.  But when I am sitting, I am less clear on what I am doing vs. what I should be doing, and how bad it actually is.  My question is in two parts:  1) Do people who exhibit great posture have to think about it?  2) How does sitting posture relate to standing posture?  In particular, what types of sitting posture mistakes contribute to lumbar hyper lordosis, thoracic kyphosis and forward head when standing? "

I'm just 19 years old. Despite eating a lot, I'm still very skinny. My problem is I'm a busy student and I don't have much time to work out. I need to do a lot of stuff the whole day in the university and most of the time I don't have a choice but to sleep at around 3AM just to finish some tasks. Yeah, that much stress while I'm still 19. I don't have the confidence to go to the gym yet so I just exercise at home or at school.  For my meals, rice really is the steady food here and it's always available (it's really in the culture to eat rice.) I can go for cereal for breakfast, though. I also like fruits.  For workouts, somebody told me to lift weights more instead of jogging. I play play basketball whenever I have time and I do some quick workouts at home (quick lifts on light dumbbells, burpees, etc.)  I'm really new to this and it's about damn time to buff up to get some hot chicks. Have you guys any suggestions on how to deal with balancing my busy schedule and my ambition on being a hunk? Thanks a lot! "
2426,How to calculate calories burned from walking at 1 mph,"I tried some online calculators and they state that I burn an average of 100 calories per hour sitting at a desk.  I tried some online calculators and they state that I burn roughly 100 calories for each mile I traverse when traveling at speeds between 3mph to 6mph.  I couldn't find a pedometer that would let me calculate calories burned traveling at 1mph or slower.  But if I extrapolate the information gained from the 100 calories per mile, then traveling at 1mph would mean I burn 100 calories in 1 hour.  But that doesn't make sense to me intuitively, because it suggests studying all day in my room burns the same calories as if I were to take the day to slowly walk from one end of my city to the other end of my city?   How do you calculate calories burned traveling at speeds less than 1mph? "

2430,Need some foods or fruits recommendation for before and after gym workout,Can anybody recommends me the food or fruits or anythings which would help me in my workout before work out and after work out??  I am doing body building at the gym.  Usually before half an hour i eat 1 packet of biscuits with milk and after half an hour i go to the gym.  I go to the gym at 8 30 pm and comes from gym around 9 45 pm and then after 1 hour i eat my dinner.  So is this a good routine or bad??  Can anybody recommends me whether i am doing wrong or right?? 
2431,Greater caloric surplus on training days?,"Imagine one being in a slight caloric surplus of roughly 500kcal above their maintenance value every day, but only training four times a week. Is it better to split the eating behavior in training and non-training days or stick to the same calorie intake every day?*  Since I'd imagine a subject like that would need like 300-500kcal extra in order to compensate for the training (weight lifting) on training days but not on non-training days.  I think a little example would describe the issue better:   An evenly distributed caloric surplus of 500kcal a day would result in 3500kcal for one whole week. However going for a whopping 650kcal extra 4 days a week (training days) and only about 300kcal on the other day (in total also 3500kcal a week)   Would one of these options be better than the other? If yes, why? Or wouldn't that really take an effect at all?    *When training for muscle hypertrophy and eating to bulk up a little. "
2432,Program that includes both front squats and low-bar back squats,"Are there any programs that include both front squats and low-bar back squats?  They both seem to have athletic benefits, and it seems like it would be worth my time considering to train both around the same time.  The general advice from programs like Starting Strength or StrongLifts is to just stick with low bar squats.  But the authors seem to be primarily interested in having lifters pack on body mass, and seem to have a powerlifter bias.  I'm still definitely a novice at squatting.  I'm low bar back squatting around 175#s (I was a little higher, but realized I'd introduced form errors, and de-loaded).  Should I just stick with low bars until my gains plateau?  Or could I intelligently introduce front squats into my program, possibly  in a 3-day-a-week, A/B format, with low bar squats in the A workout, and front squats in the B workout.  I'm a rock climber, and I want to get more leg power.  I've noticed big improvements in my ability to shift my weight onto a high foot (then stand up on the high leg) since I started squatting.  It seems, though, the space between my foot, hips, and knees will be all over the place, and I'd want to be comfortable at both quad dominate and posterior chain dominate movements.  (I'd also like to be generally stronger for life, so I'm not exclusively interested in strength as it relates to climbing.)  Maybe I'm over-thinking things.  Any advice would be appreciated! "
2433,"Stallion, on floor with barbell and band","Stallion is an exercise proposed by Bret Contreras a PhD in sport science     I recently learned about The Stallion from freakishly strong powerlifter Chris Duffin, who at a bodyweight of 220 has squatted 860 pounds with just knee wraps, sumo deadlifted 900 pounds with straps, and sumo deadlifted 405 pounds for 40 reps in under one minute. You're combining a kneeling squat and a band kneeling hip-thrust. Duffin likes to use the cambered bar with these.   Is this exercise gonna use the hamstring at all or is mostly to just work the quads and glutes?  "
2434,Kettlebell hurting my wrist,"Swings and Get ups. I've been using kettlebells for a couple of years, but have not really done very much more than the swing, or used anything more than 16kg. The swing doesn't have the kettlebell against the wrist at any point, and during the get-up, another favourite, the kettlebell doesn't move against the wrist.  Punching Through. I understand the concept of 'punching through' the snatch at the top, allowing the bell's axis of rotation to be the ball and not the handle/hand.  Straight/Neutral Wrist. Yes I realise the wrist should not be extended or flexed in any way, straight line from knuckles to elbow in all kettlebell exercises.  My Issue.  Heavy weights hanging from my wrists and resting on my forearm hurt. Extending or flexing my wrist towards the bell (broken wrist position) actually relieves some of the pain, but thats bad form.  My Question. Am I just being a 'wimp', should I expect a heavy weight resting on my forearm to always hurt, or is there good technique or maybe a better kettlebell design that should fix it?   Background Context. Youtube of 800lb deadlift. In this video the guy has scraped/healing shins before he even starts, and bruised thighs and kneecaps at the end. I know it's extreme, but I can't think this is good exercise, so at what weight do kettlebells become just another ""not good exercise""? "
2435,Drills for sea swimming,"Has anyone got experience swimming in the sea? I live in India and the sea near my house is Bay of Bengal. This sea is madly violent. Crossing the initial waves is really tough. Being the first day today, I crossed them successfully but then suffered a lot. After crossing the initial waves, it was a little calm comparatively. So I feel I can do swim practice in the run up for my International triathlon coming up in Malaysia this Sep.  Can anyone please suggest some good swim drills for sea swimming? Or is it necessary that I practice in the pool for speed rather than sea and that the sea swimming is just to get the feel not for speed training? "
2436,What workout works for me?,I am a kid 15 years and I want to get stronger physically. I don't want to look big and almighty.  What kind of workout ( bodyweight cuz I cant do gyms) can u suggest? Any diet?  To give perspective of my current strength. 3- Push ups 25- Squats 3- Chin ups ( 0 pull ups) 10- Lunges  I can manage any length and diet so please help me. 
2437,When/How to do a comeback to the training regime after a couple weeks break?,"This might have been asked before, phrased in a different way but how do you go back to your training regime after a couple of weeks break, due for instance to a cold infection?  I normally try to train 3-4 times a week; 2 sessions of football, and 2-3 sessions of weights/cardio. But a couple of weeks break seems to revert me back to a weaker, slower state. How do you get back on schedule, without straining your body too much after a minor infection? "
2438,My left arm is much much stronger than my right!,"I've been going to the gym for about three weeks now. For the first two bicep workouts I did 2.5kgs,for my third I tried with 5 but I couldn't even get my right arm to lift up just a little. However I could easily do a few reps on my left. How do I balance out? Also, when should I ideally be adding weights to my bicep workout?  "
2439,Standing desk mat with office chairs?,"We have standing desks and office chairs with wheels.  I want to get a mat to stand on, but if I had one under my desk i'd have to move it every time I wanted to sit in my chair.  Are the're standing desk mats that wheeled office chairs can roll over or work with?  Is there a solution to this problem? Is this the wrong forum for this, seemed like the most appropriate one. "
2440,Should I adjust the intensity (weight) between sets of weighted pull ups?,I'm training weighted pull-ups to increase my 1 RM. My understanding is that I should do 5 reps or less. My question is should I adjust the weight each set to keep hitting 5 reps? Or should I just pick a 'constant' weight as long as it keeps my reps under 5?   For example: I pick 75 lbs added weight for my weighted pulls and my first set I do 5 reps but by my last set I can only do 2 reps.  Any studies to support your answers are appreciated!  Also I've read 5 reps or less but is there any reason I should aim specifically for 5 rep or maybe only 1 rep? Thanks! 
2441,What's the best way for an intermediate-level runner to improve?,"For a mid-level runner (7m - 7m30s per mile over distance) with a couple of marathons under their belt, what's the best way to improve their running?    Should they simply be doing more running or would some sort of gym/strength work be more beneficial or maybe even a yoga class? "
2442,"Pull up progressions, resistance band vs regular?","I'm currently working towards doing 10-15 full form overhand grip pull ups at slightly wider than shoulder width. I can only do about 1 of them per set while keeping proper form. I can do 7-12 with proper form using a purple resistance band (12 in first set, then slowly dropping down every set to 8 at failure. However I can do about 3-5 neutral grip pull ups at less wide than shoulder width.   My question is, if I want to achieve the first thing (10-15 overhand), will I benefit more from doing 3x5 reps of neutral grip with full weight, or 10x3 with purple resistance band? I'm 135lbs and 6'2. Also when should I opt for a lower level band to hold less of my weight? I have been doing the resistance band ones for 2 weeks now and I improved from being able to do 7-8x3 to the 12-8x3 but i'm not sure if that's the best improvement I could have expected.  "
2443,The leg workout,"I am an ectomorph, looking to increase muscle and mass.   My previous leg workout was,   Smith Squats  Dumbbell lunges  Leg extension  Leg curls   and Calf raises   New workout is,   Leg Press  Leg Extension  Leg curls  calf raises  hip adduction and abduction   I feel this workout doesn't really fire my legs as it used to in the old one.  Q1- Which exercise should I add to this new regime?  Q2- I tried doing barbell squats with a plain barbell and had hard time balancing it, plus my knees went past the toes all the time, is that ok?  Q3- In my previous workout the trainer told me to leave glutes (with the machine), while this new trainer says do abduction and adduction, are they beneficial for me?  "
2444,Effective way to increase number of push up reps per set?,"If I do push ups using four sets like this: 40, 30, 20, 10 (100 in total), with 3 min intervals between sets...  Which of the following (A or B) would be more effective to do the next workout day (considering that muscles have recovered) if I want to gradually increase the max number of reps in a first set to a 100? And why? Would like to understand the principle, if there's any.  A: 50, 30, 20 (100 in total)  or  B: 50, 20, 20, 10 (100 in total) "
2445,"If I lift weights and eat exactly my calorie requirements, what will happen to my body?",I know I won't lose or gain weight if I lift and eat my exact calorie requirement (including the calories burnt during a workout) - but what will happen to my bodyfat percentage? Will no muscle grow and no fat be burnt? 
2446,Serious training and fitness for old people,The over-65 population is growing rapidly and many of us are training seriously and some are competing in sports.  Should old people train differently than young people?  Have there been research studies on training for old people? 
2447,Swinging lower body in pull-ups,Sometimes my lower body swings when I'm doing pull-ups. Is it bad to swing the lower body when doing pull-ups? Are there any benefits to keeping it immobile? 
2448,Should I be doing push-ups if I can do dips in order to hit chest muscles?,"I was doing the following exercise [website]My question is: should I just switch to dips (My priority muscles are chest muscles), or should I perform both dips and that exercise about which i attached the link above? "
2449,Could cyclic eating help us to keep our metabolism up?,"   Insulin oscillations with period of 3 - 6 minutes are believed to   be important for insulin sensitivity by preventing downregulation of   insulin receptors.   Reading this I was wondering, if the body is using oscillations on small time scale to prevent downregulation, maybe this tells us also something about how to organize our diet on bigger time scale, too.   So I was thinking that maybe eating regularly always the same amounts of food is unnatural to our body and ultimately leads to downregulation of our metabolism. I think it could make sense, because in ancient times people couldn't eat regularly. Instead they had days when they had a whole mammut as food source and a lot of other days in a week where they had only a few berries.   So our bodies might be better adapted to cyclic eating, e.g. eating every second day 3000 kcal instead of eating 1500 kcal every day.  Are there any studies out there that could support such a line of thinking? Should we better try to eat our food or even supplements/drugs in huge amounts on a single day and then wait for one or several days until we get the next portion to prevent our body from downregulating important receptors and decreasing the metabolism? "
2450,Why does a giant surplus in calories result in immediate strength gains?,"I notice that days where I don't eat much, I sometimes fail to get up big lifts with weights.  On days when I sometimes get big surpluses, such as big feasts/etc., I feel powered and like there's lots of more driving force/energy in completing lifts. It's like a big surplus gives you more power.  Is there any explanation for this? Is this why a lot of heavy/obese people can get some big weights moving (like perhaps bench, deadlifts, presses, etc.), despite them not having too much training/etc.?  It's like there's a correlation between intake and outward energy from the foods/etc.  "
2451,What is the protocol for muscle maintenence (stay the same mass)?,"Let's say a bodybuilder has been lifting heavy in the 8-12 rep range, eating a high protein diet, and so has attained substantial muscle mass. Now the bodybuilder would like to just maintain the same muscle mass. How should the exercises and diet change from the previous bulking mode to this new maintenance mode?   Does lifting weights in the 16+ rep range maintain muscle? Does intense cardio, like sprinting, help maintain leg muscle? I know protein is important in building muscle, but what role does it play in maintaining muscle?  "
2452,Suitable way for exercising upper body,"I'm currently using 30 day fitness challenge app, Full-body workout medium plan 2, it's great and working fine but I feel that it's only exercising my lower body. I want to exercise my upper body (arm and chest).  Should I make it one day for upper body and one for lower body ? or how should I organize that?  Thank you in advance! "
2453,What's the point of training asymmetrically?,"Why would a boxer, for example, train jumping rope or doing anything that is not the same type of movement that happens in a fight? Can you just train by performing the activity you want to improve? Like a runner training exclusively through running, swimmer by swimming and so on. "
2454,How to increasing running distance,"I can run a mile, mile and half at 9.5 - 10 minutes per mile but after that my stomach starts hurting on the right side, right at the bottom of the rib cage. If I really push it, I could probably make it to 2 miles.  I want to be able to run for 5 miles at that speed. What's the best way to increase my running distance?   I could run a mile, slow down to walking pace for a few minutes, then run another mile, or I can push it and run 1.5 miles for a few days and try to slowly increase from there.   Or maybe, I could slow down my run and try to increase the distance and work on the speed after?  What's the recommended approach?   I'm fairly fit, maybe 10 lbs overweight but otherwise healthy. I recently started exercising again, I'm doing cardio at home 2 - 3 times a week and run/lift weights at the additional 2 - 3 times a week, so I'm not a couch potato, but cardio has never really been my strong suit. "
2455,Keep up in shape and muscle mass,"I'm 26 and |I used to workout a lot(every day). Now, I have school and need to spend a lot of times in front of a computer. Is there a way for me to keep up my shape and muscle mass(Like super sets for short period of time)? How fast will I lose muscles if I stop working out? Would eat a lot affect muscle mass(would I just gain fat and not lose muscle mass so that I can just burn them out later when I finish school)? "
2456,How do I know if my skins compression clothing are too tight or not tight enough?,"Recently, I decided to invest in some Skins as I've been doing a bit of exercise. I plan to use them for things like running, cycling and maybe soccer.  On the packet I'm right on the verge of being a S or M. I decided to buy the S citing the shop assistant's advice that they should be tight to work.  I just gave them a try on a bike ride - at first they felt really tight and weird, but after I got used to it, I think they felt okay.  The only problem was when I got home and it was a real struggle trying to take them off. Is that normal? I eventually somehow violently got them off - I'm scared though that if I have to do that every time, I may end up ripping them or stretching them out of shape.   They came off okay in the shop but maybe as they were a bit damp from my sweat, it was a little harder. Is that normal? Should I just wait till after I've cooled down a bit to take the skins off? "
2457,Is my heart rate too high to run?,"I recently joined a gym, with the sole purpose of getting fit. In my induction I had a checkup and had a resting heart-rate of 99. After a few months I'm down to 64, which is far more normal of course. However, when I'm exercising it shoots up incredibly high.  While cycling or on the cross trainer I can work pretty hard with it remaining about 150-160, which is probably still a bit high, but considering I was told around 140 as an ideal rate, I'm hoping as my fitness improves I can remedy that. But I started doing a couch to 5k program, and that's where the bigger figures came from.  So far I am only in to week two, currently running (it's not flat out, 9kph on the treadmill), where I have to run for 90 seconds then rest for 120. After the run, my heart rate is way up above 180, once almost 190. After resting for the two minutes it's usually back down to the mid 160s. I told this to my advisor and he said that's too much, especially considering my family actually has a history of heart problems (my dad had a heart attack in his 30s, angina, etc).  I am 28, 6'2"" and 250lbs, so obviously I need to lose around 50lbs, but while running I don't feel I can't manage it. Yes it's quite hard work, but I can do it. But obviously I don't want to wreck my heart! I read this: Is this heart rate too high for a beginner runner? and read about how in some schools of thought it should be between 60% and 90%, so I'm wondering if it's still possible to run, as the couch to 5k program only last about 20 minutes per session?  My question is this: I trust my advisor, and I will probably take him up on the offer of some personal training for some more in-depth advice on how to best push myself without hurting my heart, but has anyone else been in, and overcome, a similar situation before? Is it a case of dieting and doing exercises that don't max my heart out for a while until I'm fitter so that I have less weight and can run without it peaking so much?  The main thing I think that's confusing me is that when I stick to the heart-rates suggested to me, I just don't feel like I'm working hard at all. I don't want to be a body-builder, I just want to lose weight and improve my fitness, with a long-term goal of being able to run 10k in one go. Any advice or links to reading so I can further expand my (admittedly minimal) knowledge before I fork out for PT would be most gratefully accepted. "
2458,Arching the back during bench press,"How dangerous is arching your back while doing a bench press? I've seen tons of guys in the gym who greatly arch their back off the bench, assumedly to assist with the lift. Is this bad, or just an alternate form? "
2459,What are normal pace ratios for different activities?,"I normally try to run at around an 8 minute mile.  Today I kayaked for about 2.2 miles and it took 40 minutes, so I thought of this question.  How difficult would it be to look at training records and say ""I am better at X than I am at Y""?  If you considered running, swimming, biking, and boating, what would the ratios of the speed or pace be for each activity for a ""normal"" athlete and what are the problems with looking at it this way?  What would being better at one (after training equally or less) activity over another say about someone's physical shape or body type? "
2460,Technique Improvement for StrongLifts [Form Check],"After reading answers to my previous question (Struggling with barbell row and overhead press - StrongLift), I decided to record my sessions and seek advice on my form.   Squat: back view, side view Bench Press Barbell Row Overhead Press DeadLift   Would love to hear about what I am doing wrong and what I can do to improve my form. Apologies for weird angles and so many people. Thanks "
2461,How can I improve my subsequent runs,"Right now, I'm running twice a week, Wed and Fri. My Wed run is usually really good, I run about 5 miles usually with no problem (been doing the 10k trainer app). Fridays are usually much harder and I'm pretty winded and ready to quit by 2.5 or 3 miles.  I'm not doing anything different between the two, only the time of day, one is about 3 hours later in the morning (4:30am (wed) vs 7:30am (fri)). I would think that 2 days for recovery would be enough. Maybe it's not? What am I missing that I should do so that my Friday run can be as good as my Wed run?  Edited: In answer to @Ed W   Age: 43 Fitness level: Reasonable. I mostly work a desk, but I play racquetball 2 hours on Sat's, and do weights 2 days a week in addition to running the two days mentioned above. I'm probably about 30 lbs overweight, only a little paunch in the front, not too bad :-| Goal: Mostly fitness, but interested in being able to complete a 10k if I wanted. Don't expect to get in top half of finishers, but maybe someday I'd like to increase my speed some. Pace your currently running: about 10 minute mile, pretty slow. Graduated the c25k (couch to 2k) app to the 10k trainer, and have been using that. I tried starting the c25k over once I'd finished it and running a much faster pace rather than jogging (to try and build my speed up), but kept getting massive calf cramps and went back to jogging. Running experience: Nothing until the last 18 months. I broke my collarbone playing racquetball and then when I went back to racquetball after I was healed, I was really out of shape. I started with the C25k app to get into better cardio and have stuck with it. Other training or activity: See fitness level above, that's about it.  "
2462,What is long distance running? How much is too much?,"So let's say you're running 30 minutes to one hour each day, under what category is that? It certainly isn't warm-up, cause it's pretty long. Is that considered long distance running? Or is long distance running for dozens of miles?  I just love running but want to keep things in moderation also, sometimes I actually go twice a day. That's how much I love it. It's like a drug. "
2463,Improve Sled Pull for Mountaineering,"I am training to climb Mt. McKinley where I will be pulling uphill a 60lb sled with a 60lb pack on my back for 8-9 hours. I would like to know, other than actually pulling a sled, what exercises should I engage in that will prove beneficial?      Currently I climb the 20 floor stairwell at work with a 60lb pack during lunch and I cycle everywhere, approx. 250km a week, on a fixie with a hard ratio.    Is cycling working the same muscles that would be used during sled pulling? How can I prepare/improve for an endurance based sled pull?  All the information I can find is heavy sled pulls to improve acceleration, nothing geared towards literally pulling a sled... "
2464,Goodmornings: what rep scheme should I use,"I tweaked my elbows recently, and need to layoff pullups and deadlifts for a little while until things heal.  I'd like to substitute goodmornings as a hip-hinge exercise until I can return to deadlifting.  What kind of training frequence do people usually use with goodmornings?    From what I've read of the popular 5x5 programs, there seems to be a lot of emphasis on getting the right rep range for a given exercise.  Full deadlifts are recommended for 5x1, once a week.  Power cleans are recommended for 5x3, if I recall correctly.  How do people usually program goodmornings?  I was thinking a 3x5 plan, twice a week, trying to make 5-10lbs improvements between sessions as I can.  I'm planning on doing the workout in a full power cage, so I can adjust the safety pins so dumping the weights isn't a problem.  Does anyone see a problem with this approach? "
2465,Reducing variability in body composition measurements,"I have a Nokia Body+ scale that I use to regularly measure myself.  While weight tracking has been working as expected, I see some pretty big swings in body composition.  Below is a graph of one month's muscle mass measurements, where muscle mass has varied by about 15 points in a month and about 7 in a short series of measurements.    Up to this point, I'd been content to just look at the long term trend and let the errors average out, but I'm getting to the point where accuracy matters.  I've been trying to stay consistent in when I measure and what I'm wearing, but are there other things I could do to improve the measurement?  (For example, washing and/or drying my feet off ahead of time?)  Or is it that there's an inherent imprecision in this or all BIA scales and I should be looking at different measurement equipment? "
2466,How delicate is a state of ketogenesis?,"I am losing weight on a keto diet, staying under 20g of carbs every day.  Today I slept late and didn't have time to pack my lunch.  Buying lunch at a gas station limited my options, and for lunch I went over my allotted carbohydrates.  I now at ~50g, and I'm wondering if/how this will effect ketogenesis.  So how delicate is this diet?  Will I break ketogenesis, and have to restart it over the course of days?  Every time I do a few months of keto, it takes a few days to feel like it's gastrointestinally ""normal"".  Will I have to go through this ""keto flu"" again?  Can ketogenesis be undone in one meal, or is more cheating required? "
2467,Good exercises for lower pecs without weights,"Note: I'm just trying to get in shape over the summer while I'm away from school so I'm an amateur when it comes to physical fitness and I might not know what I'm talking about.  As of right now I'm just working out at home with out using any weights and I've been trying to do some pecs exercises (specifically to trim down chest fat, man boobs if you will). I found a couple pages online stating that pushups (regular style) are one of the best exercises you can do without weights so that's what I've been doing. The only problem is that so far I haven't noticed much of a change. Now I know building muscle takes time but the pushups in particular raise concern because I've notice significant changes in the other areas of my body that I've been working out (with other exercises) for just as long. Before coming to stack exchange to discuss this I talked to a friend of mine about the situation. I asked him if I was doing anything wrong or if there's a specific exercise to burn chest fat. Now I'm not sure how correct his response is but he told me something along the lines of,     Regular pushups will build your upper pec. Whereas I need something that works my lower pec in order to burn chest fat.   He didn't know of any lower pec exercises that could be done without weights off the top of his head so I ended up googling it. This is where my problem lies, I found a number of different webpages all saying a number of different things.   Some examples of things that were suggested are:  Elevated push ups    Or  Clapping push ups    Ultimately my question is:  What is the best exercise to burn chest fat (without the use of weights)?  Or are the above examples acceptable? "
2468,Is using compression clothing during a work out a good or bad idea?,I recently saw a question here about using compression clothing while exercising.  I do not have any compression clothing.  But if it they are a valid exercise tool to enhance a workout I would like to know so I can consider buying one or not.  And if it is just hype then I would like to know so I do not waste time thinking about it.  What are the pros and cons of using compression garments while exercising?  And if one is used on the belly should exercises like crunches be avoided? 
2469,Fixing a disproportionately weak squat,"I've been doing Crossfit full-time (5-6 days/week) for a year now, and I have a really, stubbornly weak squat. It's so weak that it's always my limiting factor on compound movements like thrusters, cleans &amp; jerks (not my upper body). I have very long limbs in general and especially long femurs, but it would surprise me if that's the only problem.  My stats and 1RMs  Body weight: 135 lb Sex: Female Back squat: 103 lb Front squat: 93 lb Deadlift: 183 lb Squat snatch: 68 lb (the limiting factor is the squat) Power clean: 103 lb (better than my squat clean because no squat) Strict press: 68 lb Strict pullups: 5   Here are some hypotheses I have considered and ultimately dismissed (but correct me if I should reconsider):  Hypothesis #1: I should do Starting Strength.  Counter-evidence: I did SS assiduously(*) for 9 months before starting Crossfit. It worked moderately well for most of my lifts except my squat, which plateaued extremely fast. Now that I'm doing Crossfit, my other lifts are again improving, while my squat rarely budges.   Hypothesis #2: I should eat more.  Counter-evidence: I eat around 2400 calories/day with a lot of protein, and my squat is the only lift that's so stubborn, so I assume this isn't the problem.   Hypothesis #3: I have a mobility problem.  Counter-evidence: If anything, the coaches at my gym comment that my mobility is unusually good. I can sit in an ass-to-grass squat with my knees touching my chest and my butt touching the ground, for example.  Hypothesis #4: I have a squatting form problem.  Counter-evidence: I'm lucky that my Crossfit gym has a strong emphasis on lifting technique, and the coaches think my squat form is reasonable. Their main comment is that I have a hard time keeping my torso upright (especially in back squats, but also front squats). I've tried to work on this, but it seems partly like a necessarily evil given the extreme length of my femurs compared to my upper body.   So what should I do to suck less at squatting? Are there diagnostics I can use to figure out what the problem is?  (*) Pun intended. Not going to lie. "
2470,I'm underweight. How do I gain weight without always being stuffed and without sacrificing exercise?,"I lost 10kg in 5/6 months this summer due to things like running for 30min 6 days a week, not eating carbs at night and never eating more than 1000 calories a day. My nutritionist gave me a meal plan and I stopped running and started strenght training instead (with 1,5 dumbbells), I'll admit I don't fully commit to the meal plan especially the quantities of rice/pasta. Now I always eat between 1300-1600 calories a day, I weight 42kg and heigh is 167cm. I'm scared to stop exercising bc the reason I started it was so I could lose belly fat bc i've always been skinny fat and wanted to stop being that and be comfortable in a bikini (which I still am not). I also love exercising, it makes me feel good, but I can't control myself, or add more calories than usual just bc of it. I have an eating disorder, and refuse to eat anything considered not healthy or anything that's refined like cookies, white rice or white bread (although sometimes I have to do it but feel awful afterwards). I dont know I know I need to gain weight but dont really want to if it means more belly fat, how do I gain weight the right way? And how much do you think I should be eating for each meal? I'm 18 and a girl "
2471,Is cycling the best option to strength the thighs muscle and make them look smaller?,"I am concern about my thighs size.  I an adult men weighing 56.4 Kg, 165 cm tall (5.4 feet), considered as a short man.  My last visit to a nutritionist, was a disaster. She told me that I should not lose more weight. And I should focus on gaining muscles by going to gym or buying some home equipment to do so.  In my first visit, the weight was 57.5 Kg and the mass of body fat (MBF) was 10.5 kg And the control of MBF was +0.0. So she told me to stop walking for 45 minutes per day, or at least walking less than that and increase the muscles build.  I was concern of my thighs size, while standing the diamter is 54 cm. And when I sit down it will go very wide.  The segmental assessment gave:   1.89Kg of MBF and 7.77Kg of SLM (Soft Lead Mass) for the left leg 1.88Kg of MBF and 7.86 of SLM for the right leg.   The dietitian told me to do some cycling to strength up the thighs muscle so the look will change and it will firm up when sitting.  Reading from this article:     So yes, cycling will change the shape of your legs, but unless you’re   doing a LOT of squats, and maintaining the same levels of fat (by   eating A LOT), you’re not likely to get “bigger”.   And it made me confused about doing cycling or not.  So is cycling going to make my thighs bigger or smaller ? And what other things to do other than cycling to strengthen the muscles and make them look smaller? Squats are not an option as I don't want to get a curved bottom. "
2472,Workout in the morning,I'm going to start going to the gym before work which is going at 7AM. My question is when do i have my breakfast?   Before or after the GYM and if before the GYM how much time do i need to process the food And if after do i finish working out and directly eat or wait?   Thanks 
2473,"5BX XBX or alternative daily ""busy people"" workout","I was looking for a daily workout routine to do for me and my wife. We both are quite busy people and have three young kids, so I was looking for something easy to do at home, but enough to keep some kind of fitness. I stumbled upon the 5BX and the similar XBX routines, but they are quite back in the past and may have some missing points/improvements. I am also afraid that they may be dangerous, which I'd rather not test at all.  What would you suggest? Keep to that, or do something alternative? I already replaced the traditional sit-ups with the variation with bent legs. "
2474,Best timing for consuming supplements relative to excercise,"I've been on an introductory fitness routine for several months to slim down.  I've managed to lose 30lb (down to 180 from 210, I'm 6' 1"" so this puts me to the upper limit of my BMI), and I've developed some muscle. I'd now like to start researching supplements to build mass (not a lot, just enough to fill out my shirts better), and find out the best time to ingest nutrients to optimize the availability of them during my workout.  Is it better to take my shakes before or after exercising ? One hour apart ? 2 ? 3 ? Please forgive my ignorance, this is all really new. "
2475,Hemoglobin levels and cardio capacity,"I am a blood donor, giving about 0.5L blood approx every 3-4 months. Last time I was in to give blood, I had a short chat with the nurse about Hgb levels in blood, recuperating after the donation and it got me thinking...  I was out taking a jog the next day and it was MUCH harder than a couple of weeks ago, I was short of breath almost directly after 3-4 km. Since my O2 carrying capacity had decreased by a quarter or so, it was understandable. I know it'll take a bit of time to recover the iron that was lost during donation, and I adapt my diet accordingly.  What I wonder is:   Q1: is an optimal level of iron/Hgb that is dictated by my metabolism, or can I increase my Hgb level beyond what it was earlier by adapting a more iron-rich diet?   To give an example, my Hgb levels are between 140-150 g/L normally. Having lost a quarter of that amount recently, can I go beyond that range by adapting an iron-rich diet, or will I just not take up more iron from my diet once I get back to my ""normal"" level?  Q2: As a follow-up question; does more iron equate higher cardio capacity? I suspect that it's not that simple...   Please note that I'm looking for information with scientifically relevant references and not urban legends or rumours that are perpetuated in gyms.  "
2476,Chest excercises without bench,I currently don't have access to a bench but I wan't to target my chest.  This question:     How should I do push up to get better chest?   has some great info about targetting your chest with push ups.  I have an ez-curl bar and dumb bells. Are there any other exercises that I can do to really target my pectorals? 
2477,How to correlate reps into training program when doing isometric exercises?,"I'm doing max weighted dead hangs. To improve grip/finger strength for climbing. I'm doing a lot of research on how to create training programs to increase max strength but everything I've seen so far is related to movements where reps are a range of motion. With this particular exercise, it's not as obvious (or is it?). How can I relate reps into my training program?  Note: I don't feel that hanging for 10s jumping off and jumping right back on and doing another 10s would be analogous to doing reps.  I'm also trying to build max strength so I want to keep my reps low and intensity high and I'm just confused as to how I can relate typical ROM exercises to isometrics.  Any ideas are welcomed. Any resources/studies are appreciated! "
2478,Strength biceps-triceps,"How can be produced a powerful punch.What muscles needs? I workout biceps and triceps,does this play a role or is clearly about technique.What should I improve? "
2479,Arms get tight and being during workout,"Basically what the title says. I just started working out for about a month now and my arms get veiny even when I'm not doing an arm workout, they also feel tight and I don't have much energy to use them, even though my muscles feel fine. Is this normal? Or should I be worried? "
2480,P90X Protein Portions,"So in the P90X meal plan, it says you can substitute 1/3 cup of protein powder for a protein serving.  Now, the serving size of most (if not all) whey proteins is 28.5 g - or one scoop. Basically, one of those scoops, just by thinking about it, wouldn't even fill up like 1/4 cup all the way, would it?  Grams to cups isn't a direct comparison so I'm kind of confused.  Going by what I'm thinking, it would take like 2 scoops of whey protein to fill 1/3 cup, which is one serving, and I wanted to replace two servings, which would be like 4 scoops of whey protein in a shake.  Is this even like...healthy? (I'd be replacing probably 2 protein servings each day)  Any tips would be appreciated. "
2481,How to prepare for 10k run with 40-42min timing,"I did my first 10k with 59.34min recently one month back.  Right now, I'm running 5 day a week.Wed and Sunday are rest day.  Last week 20Mile(32Km)  Tread Mill Monday    6Km 9.4Km/hour 39 Tuesday   6Km 9.7Km/hour 37.24 Wednesday Rest Thursday 6Km 10Km/hour 36.30 Friday    6Km 10.5Km/hour 35  Outdoor Saturday  8.1 5:49/KM(pace) Time 47min (used strava) Sunday    Rest  This Week 25Mile(40Km)  Tread Mill Monday    7Km 10.6Km/hour 39 Today     7Km 8.9Km/hour  48 Wednesday Rest Thursday  7Km ?

Today I reduced my speed after seeing lot of people injured themselves by pushing hard and I was doing the same thing in treadmill. I want to build mileage with my run then I want to increase my speed. I am targeting 40-43min 10k right now.  Please suggest at what pace(speed) I should run to avoid injury and build my stamina and endurance. And how should I achieve my target time without injury  Rest/Recovery plan? if any "
2482,Getting into shape without becoming a body builder,"I'm starting the gym in 4 days, I've recently gained a bit of weight (1 stone) and I am trying to lose it and tone up... Does anyone have any advice on gym-related things and also dietary stuff?  I hear that challenges are great where you follow a certain diet and training regime  My goal is to lose 1-2 stone, my plan is to go to the gym for 1 hour everyday   I don't know the first thing about healthy foods, can anyone recommend any good challenges / fitness regimes / diet plans that actually work? "
2483,What are the pros and cons of running versus walking?,"I enjoy going for long -- I mean, ten mile -- walks. Part of this is because I was training for the Susan B. Komen 3-Day Walk about a year ago, and I got into the habit of taking very long walks because of it.   However, some of my friends insist that I should start running, now that I've been walking on and off for a year. I hear all sorts of conflicting information about walking vs. running, so I figured I'd just ask here.  Assuming distance is constant (that is, that I'd walk or run, say, five or ten miles, regardless) and that time is not a factor (if it takes me two hours or four doesn't really matter to me), how do walking and running compare? That is, what are the pros and cons, health-and-fitness-wise, of walking vs. running? "
2484,Pull-ups - should I start greasing the groove?,"I started working out a couple of months ago. Currently, I can do 5-6 clean normal pull-ups and 7-8 clean chin-ups. So far my training has involved going to the gym 2-3 a week.  If I wanted to increase these numbers, possibly doubling them, how should I proceed?  I have read in various sources that greasing the groove (i.e. doing only so much pull-ups that you do not get exhausted, but every day and 2-3 times a day) is particularly good for pull-ups because of their low volume. Especially if one is a beginner and can only do so and so much pull-ups. At the same time, this strategy is contrary to everything you usually read about how muscles grow.  What has worked best for you? "
2485,get taller advertisment,"I have seen on internet a site that claims  you can become tall even after 25. You can take many inches. There are many fotos before and after from many humans. I search it and I find different aspects , some of them conflict but I didn't get from them a result if this is true or not. I am 22 I don't think I can increase my high but this gave me hope. Many in YouTube telling its a scam,is it? Can be a good scientific answer why it can't be this in age 25.I don't write the site but I think everyone can google it and find it. Additional to,genetics can be changing as i heard from a doctor in case you doing more than four hours a day hung up and give you few inches 2-3 ,is this true too? Workout could be used to be taller or this is a fake advertisement with only target the money. "
2486,When is the best time of day to accurately weigh yourself?,"When I weight myself often, I realize that I fluctuate a couple pounds here and there. I can never seem to get an accurate reading that I can compare to another.  Is there a time of day which you are at your ""most real"" weight? Would you suggest I simply weight myself around the same time each day (morning or right before bed?). "
2487,Effects of accidental ketosis on training,"I sometimes go into ketosis accidentally (please keep those dieting people away from me) during endurance training or shortly afterwards. Now for the first time since acquiring a 24h-hr-monitor.   I noticed an abnormal increase in rhr after the latest accidental ketosis (+13-15 on the next day instead of the usual +2-3 after the most intense workouts that I do. That's close to a 30% increase). Does ketosis really cause rhr spikes like that? I found various people telling the internet it was true, but nothing reliable. Someone on a forum for people who intentionally go into ketosis and who usually has a rhr of over 80 is not a reliable source. I guess like usual I should wait with intense workouts until the rhr is somewhat normalized again? I will wait until the ketosis goes away in any case and will see if the rhr normalizes at the same time. How bad is ketosis for training effect?   (I didn't select the ketogenic diet tag because I'm not on a ketogenic diet and would never enter ketosis on purpose. I actively try to eat lots of carbs before, during and after long exercise sessions. I'm just not doing a good enough job of it, it seems) "
2488,Injury/Danger from uneven muscles?,"I recently had a question about my uneven lats on here. Since the lats are responsable for scapula-movements to a degree, can uneven lats (and/or traps maybe) be dangerous when performing movements like bench press in which scapula retraction is key for shoulder safety? Or is the difference to small to be dangerous? "
2489,Does the Bulgarian split squat target the glutes better than normal squats?,"Based on my observations, when I do Bulgarian split squats, they hit the glutes really nicely. In fact, even if I do the Bulgarian squat without doing regular squats, my glutes are very sore the next day. My regular squats are deep (butt to the ground), but if I do regular squats alone in a workout, the next day my glutes aren't sore. I use the same weight for both type, except for the Bulgarian split squats I use a smith machine (so that my shoulders doesn't fatigue as quickly) while for the normal squats I use a barbell in a squat rack.  Does this make it a better choice if a person wants to build the glutes? "
2490,How to adapt couch to 5k for treadmill?,"I had a look at the ""treadmill version"" on the c25k website, but it has runs lasting &lt; 2 minutes. The treadmill that I want to use, is very slow changing speeds - I'm concerned that going from walk to run (or back) could take several seconds, and out of a 90 second run, 10 seconds is a lot.  Should I not include the transitional time in the walk/run duration? Or should I count it as part of one or the other? It seems like the rapid walk/run transitions are designed for running outdoors, where it is easy to switch between them - how can I adapt the plan to work with a treadmill? "
2491,Does alcohol affect a diet?,"I'm on a diet aimed at reducing the amount of fat in my body. Reducing fat is my first priority, actually losing weight second. How will drinking hard alcohol (let's say vodka or rum) affect my diet? How bad is it? "
2492,Benefits of neck extension training?,"Does training the neck have any purpose other than for combat sports and getting the thick neck look (which I assume is desirable when heavily bulking so your head doesn't look too small?)?  For example, might it help with forward head posture, relieve tightness in the neck or shoulders or be desirable for other common daily activities?  I'm just starting a strength training program that does quite a bit of neck extension work and I'm wondering if I should omit it. "
2493,Are calories the only important aspect of a diet?,"I've recently started using apps like MyFitnessPal to calculate the amount of energy and nutrients I consume and do some simple number crunching for me. However, all these apps seem to be focused on calorie intake and not much more.  How does fat, sodium, sugar, carbs effect my weight loss diet? Are calories proportional to the amount of fat (etc.) and is therefore an accurate representation? Will simply managing calories be an accurate method of weight control? "
2494,Why do some people train in the gym with warm clothes?,I used to see in the gym people that train with warm clothes while others are with shorts and undershirts. Some of them even put the capuchon on their head while training. What is the reason for those who train with warm cloths? (see an example here and here) it's supposed to be inconvenient and make the body too warm and sweaty. 
2495,"Weed, sex and gym",I have very simple question - Is it bad to have sex and/or get high after gym? How those activities affect gains and mass growth? Thanks a lot! 
2496,Can running for 20 minutes on your rest day prevent muscle growth?,So I am doing this workout-    So I am a bit skinny and you have to do this 4 times a week to gain muscles. And so you have to keep 1 day off between 2 workout to let the muscles heal.  But at the same time I have a small belly and I want to get rid of it. So from today I started running in the morning with an empty belly(without eating anything) for 20 minutes. Should I restrict this running too to 4 day a week? Does running prevent the muscles from regenerating?   Or should I run everyday and running doesn't count as an exercise on my rest day? 
2497,How can I engage my chest more when doing pushups?,"I understand that pushups are supposed to be a chest exercise primarily. However, I find that I use my triceps and anterior deltoids more than my chest when doing the exercise. How can I engage my chest more when doing pushups? Do I do it by squeezing the chest in the eccentric portion? Thank you.  "
2498,Question about my new workout routine,"So I watched this video-  [website]This is freaking perfect for me!! I am 15 and will turn 16 on Sep 8. Almost 2 months ago i was REALLY skinny but then i started doing daily pushups. Now I do 200-100 daily. And my body right now is the one he had when he was 15. So I am gonna adopt this strategy.   So, my question is, I need some clarification about this. So, what he is saying is that we have to chose 2-3 exercises from every topic. Then do 4 sets of 8-12 reps of every one of those exercises everyday, 4 days of week?   And also I have a bit of extra fat on my stomach and I want a ripped body but you can't get ripped with extra fat..so should I run every morning without eating anything?  PS: This is my first post here so sorry if there is something wrong with this post or if this is not meant here. Also thanks for watching the video! "
2499,Maintaining wrist flexibility while working on wrist strength,"I have a SportGrips SideWinder wrist exerciser (Sportster model) that Lauren from the CHAOS team was kind enough to send out to me. I started using it a few days ago and am following this workout routine outlined on their website which consists of:   Day 1: 20 repetitions using light resistance, then resting for 1 day. Day 2: Same as Day 1. Day 3: 10 to 20 repetitions using heavy resistance.   The routine then says to change up the order in order to prevent a plateau. I have only done exercises using the horizontal grip so far, and I can feel my muscles being worked when I use the SideWinder.  I feel though that once I progress, my muscles in my wrist and forearms will tighten up too much. What stretches can I do to maintain or increase my wrist flexibility while I strengthen my wrists? Would stretching before or after using the device make a difference? What I also want to know is what relationship there is between the degree of stretching and the amount of strength I need to twist the wrist exerciser. "
2500,How to determine my level of activeness?,"[website]That calculator requires to know my level of activeness. I take a brisk walk of 10 minutes daily.  Personal info:     My height is 162.6 cm, age is 34, gender is female, and weight is 52 kg.   I have a job that requires 8 hours sitting on a chair in front of a computer. My aim is to _gain weight. My metabolism is fast and I have low appetite.  I have started brisk walk to improve my appetite.   Where do I fit? How to determine what qualifies for light activeness, moderate activeness, and extreme activeness? "
2501,Will Pilates kill my gains?,"I am planning to start pilates for better posture and also weight training. I am planning to go to pilates in my rest days. But I am concerned with two things:  1) Will pilates kill my gains? Because I have heard that in your rest days, you have to sit still. Otherwise, you will kill your gains.  2) Is Pilates + Weight Training a good idea? My way of thinking behind this combination is the following: I need to better my posture. If I lift with a bad posture, there is a big possibility that I will worsen my posture. Hence, I will use pilates as my posture corrector and safely do my lifting. Do you think that this is a sensible idea or am I completely on the wrong track? If I am on the wrong track, could you give me some recommendations? "
2502,How to design a running program and diet plan for losing fat in a healthy manner?,"I have a specific fitness goal that I want to achieve, and I wanted to take the opinion of some Fitness.SE members to ensure that I'm going in the right direction, and if not, what steps should I take to rectify it.  Goal: Reduce fat to an acceptable percentage of body weight (currently 23.6% on a 150 lb body weight, aiming to bring it down to 10-15% depending on my genetic potential), before embarking on a muscle-gain program (as I've read that its difficult to do both at the same time!)  Plan: I've started following the C25K program for running, and would be finishing it after 6 weeks (am in 3rd week now). Once I ""graduate"" from the program, I intend to run 5K 3 days/week, in the evening. I have also started keeping a ""food log"" (using the LoseIt app), which also keeps track of my exercise calories. Using this website (do let me know if there's a better/more accurate one), I've determined what my ideal caloric requirement should be (in order to lose weight @1 lb/week), and am devotedly keeping to that target.  Questions: There are quite a few of them, but due to the nature of my query, I can't split them into multiple separate ones without repeating a lot of the above info:   Does running 5K@3 days a week (for at least 6 weeks before I look for some kind of change) constitute a good exercise plan for losing fat? I've read multiple articles on the net regarding the frequency/duration of running for fat loss, and I'm a bit lost on the kind of contradictory infos that I have gotten on a routine Google search! In case the answer to 1 is no, what other activities should I supplant my routine with? More cardio (on the same day/intervening days) using a different activity, or longer bursts of runs? I'm scared of injuring my back/knees by running too much, hence wanted to be sure. Diet - According to this link on the FDA website, my diet should be limited to (based on a 2000 cal daily req, which I'd scale down to my caloric budget) :   >= 300g Carbs (>25g Fibers included in that) Total Fat &lt;= 65g, with Saturated Fat &lt;= 20g Sodium &lt;= 2400 mg Significantly, doesn't mention much about proteins, so at a loss there!   Would this kind of a diet help me to lose fat while I'm running? If not, what should be the limits I should strive to in each of the food categories (if thats too much to ask, what should I be focusing on  the most to ensure I don't take too much/too little of it) ?   My profile   Height : 5'10"" (1.78m) Weight : 150 lb (68 kg) (Fat % = 23.6% using a handheld BIA device) Gender : Male Age    : 27   TL;DR: Ideal combination of diet/running to lose fat? "
2503,Why will walking 10 miles leave you with more energy?,"From: What are the pros and cons of running versus walking?     If you run 10 miles, you will probably find it hard to do anything else the rest of the day. Walking 10 miles will leave you will more energy.[sic]   Why does walking leave us with more energy? Is there any evidence behind this claim? "
2504,Walk one hour daily during evening,I am planning to start walking from my work place to my home. It will take 1 hour and 15 minutes(about 6 KM) to reach at my home.  Is there anything strange ? Is it okay for a man aged 28 ? 
2505,Holding on to a bar (a horizontal pull up one obviously) thicker,"There is a challenge at a beach I go to. Pay 2.5 euros for the opportunity to try and hold on to a bar for longer than 2 minutes. The bar is not fixed, meaning it can rotate. On a fixed bar I can hold on for a minute that isnt too thick. How much does this non fixed component act on your result? If I were to hold the bar with a pronated grip with thumbs over the bar , I would think that it is the same thing. Thoughts on this? Does anyone now the record for longest time holding on to a bar? "
2506,"Which are examples of ""higher intensity cardio""?","In a comment I was told:     What you want to do is focus on higher intensity cardio. That will both strengthen your heart making your body more effective at transporting nutrients/oxygen during lifting and also help you better process the byproducts of anaerobic metabolism (ie the type that creates 'the burn'). Fewer byproducts = less soreness.   I can think of running as fast as possible for a short time, and repeat. Is that basically it? Are there alternatives? If possible, some exercises I can do at home. "
2507,Powerlifting and Olympic Lifting: How much does height affect strength?,"For powerlifting and olympic lifting, the height of a person obviously has some affect. A taller person has a longer bar path which takes more power to travel. The height of a person can also affect their leverages and abilities.  Given two people with the same build and training, how much does a person's height affect their strength? Has there been any good studies on this subject?  The question deals with raw totals and not wilks or percentage of weight. "
2508,Which resources should I go to for programming ring training?,"I just received a set of EXF gymnastics rings (thanks, Team Chaos!) and I have a smorgasbord of individual exercises that I'd like to try. However, I don't want to do just a collection of random exercises or individual progressions. I'm looking for guidance on programming a strength routine using rings.  I am currently evaluating books, DVDs and in-depth websites (specifically not just individual YouTube tutorials) that have information on putting together a complete ring training regimen. So far I've found:   Building the Gymnastic Body, which doesn't focus on programming but does include it. (Review here.) Is this what I need? Is there a similar book/DVD that is closer to my needs?  GMB Rings One program, the promotion of which gives me a yucky infomercial feeling.  Various online guides, like this one from CrossFit London (PDF) or this survey of beginner techniques. The ones I've found are heavy on ""try this! and this! and this!"" but light on describing how to arrange a workout, training schedule, or the reasoning behind the exercises. Snippets of truth, like Coach Sommer noting that beginners would do best to spend their time solely on ""support holds, front levers, and back levers"". The biggest issue I have is that there's no clear time to move on from that (unless one has a coach). This is also just not substantial enough for me to design a training schedule around.   What are the best resources I should consult (and buy) regarding how to structure my ring training? The best answers will be those that involve references and personal experience. "
2509,hot water bath to gain muscles,"I have read here hot water helps increase the muscle size.In case we do a hot bath and after we do a workout.First, ""hot"" how much should it be?Shouldn't my self tolerate it or just relaxing hot?Second, how much time after bath should I do a workout for more gains? Example,I am doing after twenty minutes workout from my bath.I want answer to focused only to hot water not nutritients etc.Thanks  "
2510,What is the correct form for seated shoulder press with dumbbells?,"When doing seated shoulder presses, must the bench be set to 90 degrees? I seem to be seeing many videos where people are setting up the bench to about one notch before 90. Last night I tried this myself and felt less strain on my lower back. In addition I was able to press 35's as opposed to 30's.  My question is weather this is wrong, and if it is then how can I reduce the stress on my lower back when the bench is at its upright 90 degree angle?  Some example videos: Rob Bailey presses 150s Bodybuilder Vs powerlifter. 100x19 shoulder press. "
2511,Timing of muscle soreness - what does it tell you?,"I am currently trying to learn more about the signals my body is giving. One question I stumbled upon recently is the following:  Is there any information to be gained from muscle soreness at different time intervals after a workout? For example, I was doing an extended set of pull-ups 34 hours ago. The soreness in my latissimus dorsi peaked around 14 hours ago; the soreness in my chest peaked around 8 hours ago. Does that give away any information? Is my latissimus simply better adapted to the exercise? Worse? Is it not related at all?  I know that the scientific evidence on muscle soreness in general is rather limited. Let alone this specific question. Still, if anyone has heard of any studies on the topic, I'd be curious to get to know them. "
2512,Is there an effective body core temperature regimen that includes capsaicin?,"I am looking to try to regulate my core body temperature in order to be able to sustain longer workouts at higher intesities. I have been exercising more and am realizing that core body heat might be becoming an issue (last night after a 20-mile ride my messenger bag was soaked with sweat, whereas the prior day it was not after 30-miles). I am well aware that a lack of water may have caused the difference, but I had consumed approximately equal amounts day over day, and had eaten basically the same foods.   The one difference between the days is that before the 30-mile ride I ate two slices of bread and four eggs with bhut jolokia hot sauce all over them; before the 20-mile I had a double-stacked peanut butter and butter sandwich.   It seems more like an anomaly, but what effect could high intake of capsaicin have before a workout (aside from indigestion)? Can one engineer a regimen around capsaicin to regulate temp and sweating?   I am familiar with the impact it has on olfactory sweating, and how it ramps up the metabolism for digestion, and am wondering if it can be used to either regulate body temp on its own, or if it is just more assistive in digesting food before exercise, thus lending a hand to core temp regulation.

2513,Get taller schedule,"I want workouts for teenagers in age  14 until 19 year.Genetics influence our body ,with no genetic is difficult to see results.I have some questions I hope to answer it in all if you could.1) Workouts that will increase high. 2) What foods-nutritients needs to help the growth.3)Sleep thinking that someone is sleeping with stretching his/her body I think will see some results. How many hours sleep I have read more than 9 and I have read only 7.4) sugar and all white similar to sugar(alats? I can't remember in English the right name) should be avoided because it delay the growing? "

I want to point out that I do every exercise slow and with low weights 4 seconds down 2 seconds up and fully extend them(no cheating).  Edit  Another thing I forgot to say before each training session I do 20 minutes of HIIT on the threadmill 
2515,Information overload makes me unsure of how to lose fat weight,"Good morning,  I am an avid lurker here and I try to answers that I feel confidently knowledgeable about to answer but after much reading between answers to my own questions, other questions, and comments, I am more unsure than ever of how I should proceed.  Let me put my goal into focus: to lose fat weight.   Right now I am not interested really in strength training even though I've been doing stronglifts.   I guess the biggest thing I'm skeptical or unsure about is what ACTIVITY I should be doing(cardio? HIIT cardio?)to most effectively lose fat weight.   I love the relative efficiency of StrongLifts but as I said I am a skeptic of what it claims. The biggest ones are ""gain muscle while burning fat"", ""your body will be forced to pack on muscle to squat 300lb"" , ""more strength = more muscle"". I'm not going to lie; the latter two claims sound like total broscience and yes I know that SL 5x5 is a sort of derivative of other 5x5s like Starting Strength. I have hit a 250lb PR squat doing it, but, at weight this heavy, my lifts seem to stall and plateau all over the place even though I have deloaded and plateaued.   To me, it doesn't scientifically make sense that one could actually gain strength on SL 5x5 that isn't just a vast amount of ""newb gains"" since you technically don't actually pack on weight, whether it's muscle or fat, unless you eat over maintenance. So if you're not eating over maintenance how can you reasonably sustain any kind of strength gaining progression?  I feel like my diet is what has really hindered my progress on SL 5x5, since, to be totally honest I just don't eat that much. But now that I recognize that my primary goal right now is to lose fat weight, is a restricted diet with a strength training program even really the most efficient way to go if I'm not even really setting myself up to gain that strength? I understand the principals of intensity and volume but just don't feel like they apply the same to individuals who actually are primarily concerned with losing fat weight if you take into consideration the actual science behind weight gain and weight loss.  One of my other issues is my diet I believe. My TDEE is calculated to be 2439 calories/day, which if you take off 20% makes it 1952. I eat below 1952 every day but don't see any weight loss and I think it's because my body is used to what I eat. I consume around 1500 calories a day if I'm lucky. I tend to only eat when I'm hungry and I don't really load up much on junk food. But I'm still quite chunky. So this + the fact that my gains on SL continuously stall and plateau makes me wonder if I should be switching to HIIT cardio to reduce fat weight.  What do you guys think?  edit:  I do appreciate both answers so far and they make sense but I guess I'm just looking for something more grounded as maybe an acceptable method. I keep googling and googling and googling things like ""stronglifts fat loss"" and ""5/3/1 fat loss"" and keep seeing posts from guys who say: ""No offense man but aiming for strength while losing fat is just going to be an exercise in futility in both areas"" or ""If you're going to cut, then cut, if you're going to bulk, bulk"" or ""trying to add strength while cutting sounds like a bad idea to me"". So I just don't know what really to do.  The reason I'm so focused on finding something more grounded is because I keep reading that you need the intensity. Well I can't get stronger if I'm mostly attempting to cut which undermines the intensity. So does that mean I should cut and focus on HIIT cardio 5xWeek and then bulk up?  "
2516,pass the limits to obtain muscle,If you do one day workouts for one part from your body but you training 6 hours would you see faster results?  Example: Monday legs 3 hours in the morning and 3 before going to bed at night. The next day only biceps and shoulders the same tactic 3 morning and 3 night.  After workout eat food plenty with protein and calories.  Will a thin guy gains? 
2517,Looking to maintain (not gain) while working out 6-7 days a week,"Background Information:  Height/Weight: 5'8, 150 lbs  Sex/Age: M, 24 years  I spend all day at work in front of a computer (programming), so knowing I get to workout as soon as I'm done for the day keeps me mentally going.  Being in the gym relaxes me, and is basically my sanctuary.   Currently, I workout/lift 6-7 days a week, and train Martial Arts for MMA 3-4 days.  Since I compete in MMA, Judo and Jiu-Jitsu, I'm not looking to gain size!  I need to stay below 155 lbs for my weight-cuts (I fight at 135 lbs in MMA, for example).  Increased strength is always welcome, of course.  A typical schedule might look something like this:  Monday:  Chest/Biceps (3 workouts for each, 3 sets of 12-14 reps)  Abs (2 times, halfway and end of workout) 20 minutes on the elliptical  Judo/Wresting (1 hour)  Tuesday: Legs/Shoulders (3 workouts for each, 3 sets of 12-14 reps)  Abs (2 times, halfway and end of workout) Tae Kwan-Do (1 hour)  Wednesday: Rest Day  Thursday: Back/Triceps (3 workouts for each, 3 sets of 12-14 reps)  Abs (2 times, halfway and end of workout) Tae Kwan-Do (1 hour)  Friday: Chest/Biceps (3 workouts for each, 3 sets of 12-14 reps)  Abs (2 times, halfway and end of workout) 20 minutes on the elliptical  1-2 Hours MMA training  Saturday: Legs/Shoulders (3 workouts for each, 3 sets of 12-14 reps)  Abs (2 times, halfway and end of workout) Interval Sprints Sunday: Back/Triceps (3 workouts for each, 3 sets of 12-14 reps)  Abs (2 times, halfway and end of workout) Interval Sprints  So, my questions are the following:   Should I change my lifting workouts to better suit working out 6-7 days a week (sets, reps, muscle groups)? Should I change my cardio workouts (concentrate in a few days, spread out through the week)? What should I add to my current recovery regimen of Protein Shakes after workouts?   Keep in mind, I'm not looking to gain size (strength is welcome, though), and I don't want to be at the gym less than 6 days a week.  Thanks in advance. "
2518,Determine realistic training goals for a set period of time?,"When training in the gym, I rarely ever set myself (longterm) goals for my lifts. Or when I do, I most certainly don't reach them, what demotivates me. Is there a good way or method to determine realistic goals? So goals that are challenging in order to motivate while training but at the same time doable to achieve? "
2519,How many reps is too many?,"I understand that, for endurance, one ought to do, at most, about 24 reps per set. Is more than that too much for any exercise, in that it makes the exercise ineffective or dangerous? Is doing, for example, one superset of 70 pushups ineffectivd or dangerous; and, if it is, why?   Thank you.  "
2520,Caloric intake for fatty trying to gain muscle,"OK, I'm 6 foot tall and I weigh 215 pounds. Based on my weight when I was younger (I'm in my late thirties), I'd say I'm about 25 to 30 pounds overweight (fat) now. I started lifting about three weeks ago, and I'm already seeing a slight increase in strength, tone and size. My question is this: Because I'm already a little overweight, can I keep my caloric intake the same for a while? Would the amount of calories I consume go more toward muscle production rather than the accumulation of fat now that I'm working out? I'd hate to gain more fat in an attempt to feed newly developed muscle. I'm sure I will have to boost calories at some point in the future if my muscles continue to grow, but, for now, am I good? "
2521,Gym time after lunch,"Normally, when I wake up I don't have any hunger. I eat directly at 12:30 sharp due to work hours so I can go to the gym in afternoon? My question is: how much time should I wait for before I work-out? "
2522,Scaling benchmark workouts in Crossfit when preparing for competitions,"I've been training Crossfit and heavy lifting for a year and have intensified in the past four months and am currently at ~75% of the Rx weights listed on various workouts. I'd like to prepare for entering competitions by regularly doing a series of benchmark workouts besides a regular strength programme and occasional participation in classes.   There are dozens and dozens of benchmark WODs, how do I pick a versatile subset? Some of them involve too heavy lifting, others very many reps. The weight inevitably has to be scaled, but should I also scale e.g. 100 pull-ups by number, or simply pick the AMRAPs with fewer reps?  (A variation I've played with is a Team WOD where the number of reps are doubled, but a partner and I take turns, so we only do a subset of the reps at a time and rest while the other person works.) Should I focus on something other than benchmark WODs when preparing? Plans like The Training Plan cost almost as much as my gym membership, so I'm holding back on that.  "
2523,"For bench press, should I use dumbbells, a barbell, or the Smith machine?","With my new workout, my trainer has kept a whole day for the chest. Before this I used to decline dumbbell press and do incline smith bench press.  Current workout has, Decline, Flat and Incline presses with Fly on machine.  My question is how to decide between dumbbells, barbell and smith machine. What I have heard till now is dumbbells offer more range of motion and barbells allow lifting more weight, while the smith machine is useless and one should avoid it.  Is it true? Does Smith machine leave out shoulders altogether? Can doing flat bench press be troublesome for the shoulders?   There is this video which gives tips to bench press and states to keep your traps tight to take the load off shoulder, is that correct? Should I apply it all all my chest workouts? (tip 2 [website]"
2524,How to structure a high intensity interval training (HIIT) program?,"I have read some good things about high intensity interval training (HIIT) programs, and wanted to give one a try. The problem is I don't know how the structure of one works, so I cannot build one custom to my own needs.  Is there a standard structure or any considerations I should take into account when building a custom HIIT routine? Are there any popular or well tested programs that I can take inspiration from? "
2525,Chocolate and coconut,"I work out 4 times a week. 20 minutes running 40 minutes weight. Usually from 7pm to 8pm. I just want to eat healthy food, not supplements. I have heard that chocolate an coconut are good and healthy in a diet of someone practicing sport. Is it true? If so, in what way should I eat them and when? "
2526,Deadlifting yesterday gave me pain in my lats. What is the proper posture for deadlifting to avoid this?,"Yesterday I did deadlifts in my workout, then I got pain in my lat muscles and also in the thigh.   I think this was caused by wrong posture which also can lead to back problems. But I don't know the exact posture for deadlift techniques and why we need to do Deadlift.   So my questions are:    Is Deadlift is only for gaining muscles in legs or shaping the legs?  Why do we need to wear a belt? I searched the Internet and it seems like they prefer wearing a belt while performing deadlifts as it reduces the risk of back muscle injuries.   "
2527,Is there a problem with my gym routine?,"I try to go the gym every night, at about 10pm - 12pm.  Is it good to go at this time?  My aim is to become thinner, I am quite stocky, I have never been to the gym to increase muscle size, only to reduce my size, i.e. to get fitter/ thinner.  I normally do a straight half an hour on the rowing machine, buring around 300 - 340 calories,  and then I do a 20 minute bike ride, equivalent to 10km, burning around 180 - 200 calories.  Is there any problem there?  Another thing is that I still eat like anyone else would, not a care. What are the best kinds of food to eat when trying to lose fat/ lose weight.  Thanks in advance. "
2528,Length of sit vs. stand at adjustable desk?,"Are there any general guidelines (not hard rules), on how long you should sit vs. stand at an adjustable desk? Especially as you begin to adjust to one. This is in part following up on the answer to Should I get rid of my office chair?. I can see how it will be vary based on personal fitness and situation.  Also, are there any recommendations on foot position and stance while standing? I'm very new to sit-stand desks, and so far I've taken to a squat stance. Part of my issue has been hip mobility and pelvic tilt ""butt wink"" when performing barbell squats in the gym. "
2529,How to fill body with energy before climbing?,"I go climbing on Sundays (starting at 2-3PM). Climbing is a very energy-consuming process and I need to have my body filled with energy, so I don't feel irresistable urge to eat after couple of hours doing climbing (no way you can fix a grip on rock handle after you've eaten steak with potatoes).  My question is when and what should I eat to get lots of lasting energy for my activities? When should I consume proteins to help my muscles grow a bit? (Hands are just wasted after you spend 4-5 hours climbing). "
2530,Differences in unilateral set,"I often see people doing unilateral exercises at the gym, but almost none of them do the same thing.  For instance, if someone wants to do X sets of Y reps of an exercise unilaterally, they can do :   Alternate reps: left, right, left, right,... then pause, then repeat X times. Alternate sets: left * Y, right * Y then pause, then repeat X times Alternate exercises: left * Y, then pause, then repeat X times, then right * Y then pause, then repeat X times   What are the advantages and disadvantages of these 3 methods ? Is there any difference ? "
2531,Disadvantages of running without Heart Rate Monitor,"What, if any, are the actual disadvantages of running without a HR monitor (optical, chest strap, whatever) to check on my heart rate?   Is it not viable to simply run by the ""feeling""? If I feel my heart pounding and my lungs straining, I am close to some limit. I wouldn't push harder than I actually could, regardless of what the monitor said. Conversely, if I feel comfy and relaxed, or only moderately strained, I can always push harder.   What does the above approach lack? What are the risks/dangers in following it? Do I really need to track my heart rate with a monitor? And what exactly do I gain by using a HR monitor?   To give some context to the question, let's assume I am a semi-serious hobbyist runner. I can do a half marathon in about 2 hrs without much preparation. Some weeks I run 0 km, some weeks about 35 km (1 x 25km + 2 x 5km), or something in between. The overall goal is to get much better - as much as possible, but there are no hard goals (attain pace of x, do marathon in y minutes, etc). "
2532,DOMS: Good or Bad?,"DOMS or Delayed Onset of Muscle Soreness, everyone who trains regularly has to suffer from it. But very recently I came across an article that says muscle growth isn't at all related to muscle soreness. So the ideology of certain trainers 'No pain No again' goes down the drain.  My questions, If DOMS is not a good indicator then how do we tell if the workouts we are doing are enough to grow?  Secondly, is it bad to workout when you are seriously hit by DOMS?   Some DOMS treatments are hot/cold showers and massage, I'd love to hear your variations. "
2533,Combat sports weight-cut: How to handle the last 4 days?,"When I compete in combat sports like MMA, I have to do a major weight-cut.  Normally, 3 weeks out from competition I weigh 15 lbs above my target weight.  However, through a strict diet (with meals such as chicken, rice and a vegetable) I'm normally within 8 lbs by the last week.  Granted, this doesn't sound like a lot of weight loss accomplished in 2 weeks, but when you already have very low body fat, it's quite a task.  The last 4 days or so is normally when things get painful, because of lack of food intake and dehydration.  Typically, I will do something like this:  4 &amp; 3 days till: Normal water intake, reduce food intake by about a meal (not an entire meal, just portions of each meal is reduced)  2 days till: Reduced water intake (about 4-6 oz for the day), and two very small meals  1 day till: Reduced water intake (about 2-4 oz for the day) and a Balance Bar to keep me going.  Day Of: Nothing until weigh-in, which is normally around noon.  I have a couple of questions concerning making this a bit easier:   I've heard a few people suggest overloading your body with water 1-2 days out from weigh-ins, then dropping the intake drastically (to the amounts I do on my final 2 days).  Is there any sort of logic/science behind this? Is there any sort of vegetable, like celery, that I could snack on the last 2 days that wouldn't make me gain weight, but would help me retain my sanity? Finally, is there any alternate factor or tactic that I'm completely missing?  "
2534,Correct shoulder position when doing hanging leg raises,"What is the correct shoulder positions when doing hanging leg raises? What are the reasons to do it this way and not another one?  For example when you hang on the bar you can lift your body up and down a few inches just using your shoulder muscles (i.e. if you pull your shoulders down and in, your body lifts a few inches and the other way around). So which position is better and why. Perhaps there are more form pointers to take into account concerning the shoulders in this exercise.   "
2535,Barbell Squats: Maintaing correct form,"Today finally I did the barbell squats, I called a trainer to check out my form, but turned out he himself didn't know the correct form: his knees were going way forward his toes and he was holding the barbell almost on this shoulders, I told him that and he started 'you do squats on the smith machine'. After telling him it is bad for you, the position of legs and straight back can be dangerous etc, he bluntly disagreed and started telling me 'these machines are made for a reason, they can't be wrong, and if you don't want to exercise on machines then why are you using leg press, extension etc'. I shooed him away.  While I was doing squats, I kept looking straight, chest up, neutral spine, tight core. Starting with hips going back, I was able to do almost 10 perfect repetitions, but on the 13-15th ones my toes were coming up, and I was sort of falling backwards.  My Question: how do I stabilize my feet so the toes don't go up and at the same time knees don't pass the toes?  I felt some tightness in my lower back and I was slightly bent forward, is that normal? "
2536,Visceral fat or poor abdominal muscles?,"How can I distinguish between them in some simple way?  Sometimes after running or weightlifting it seems that my gut is quite flat. In fact abdominal muscles are visible when I try a posedown. But then when I relax, it seems that I have a big gut.  Do I need some specific exercise to make my abdominal muscles more visible or I must loose fat? "
2537,Rings performance and cardio,"Does aerobic training (cardio) help a 4-minute gymnastic rings performance?  In Overcoming Gravity Steven Low argues that an Olympic artistic rings performance is around 4 minutes, the same time as the world record for the mile. The mile is strongly influenced by aerobic capacity, so a 4 minute rings performance would be too (to a lesser extent).  This seems really dodgy reasoning to me (the sports have many differences), so I'm asking the question here. Would cardio help a 4-minute rings performance? "
2538,An odd day of little calories,"I decided I want to lose some fat recently and get a bit healthier. To give myself goals to go for each day I'm using a calorie monitoring app which recommends I have 1750 calories a day. At the moment I pretty much do little to no exercise apart from the occasional day where I go swimming or I am traveling to visit my girlfriend, I do notice that on those days I tend to eat more as I feel more hungry and usually hit around the 1750 mark, varying around 200 calories either way. Although on a usual day I have about 400 calories less averaging around 1200 calories a day.  stats Male age: 21 height: 5,7"" starting Aug 18th 185lb now(Sep 1st)      178.5lb (stopped drinking fizzys, eating out less and avoiding comfort foods)  On a day where I might go out for a meal I have sometimes gone over up to about 2000 calories, but this is quite rare. What I wanted to ask is, is the inverse acceptable? i.e. today I have only had 800 calories, although I don't feel hungry or anything, but it does seem very little to me. Could this be bad for my health? If I eat so few calories, will I burn off muscle or get ill easily from lack of nutrients?  What are the negative side affects from having a very low-calorie day once in awhile? "
2539,How frequently can I hit the heavy bag?,"I've heard that hitting a heavy bag is taxing enough that it is easy to overtrain using it, especially for beginners.  How much rest should the average person (i.e. NOT a boxer who grew up hitting things) take in between intense heavy bag sessions to let the muscles, joints, tendons etc. recover?  On a similar note, what caution signs should someone look for to avoid injury/overtraining on the heavy bag? I know wrist pain is something to look for. Anything else? "
2540,Calculating portions of protein And carbs,"I have started a new program and what still confuses me when I hear, 1     .18 x lbs of body weight Example: 200 lbs x 1.18 = 236 g of lean   protein per day   If I am right, it means I need to multiply 1.8 with my body weight (in pounds)? If so then why in example, it says 1.18 and other place .18?  "
2541,will cardio compromise mass if I'm in a caloric surplus?,"I am aware that it's not black and white simple.  If I consume enough (90%clean) calories, will cardio still compromise mass? Or is a deficit the main cannibalistic factor? "
2542,Retraction of the Scapula in Lat-Pulldowns,"In a Lat-Pulldown, is one supposed to retract their scapula before the movement begins and keep it that way the whole exercise or to protract at the top of the movement, retract again and then do the movement itself? Which of these is right, and especially why?  I see a lot of mixed advice about what the scapula has to do in a Lat-Pulldown. Main argument for the ""pro- and retract again""-Group is, that this just simply is part of the movement. Just like in a row.  On the other hand, the ""keep it retracted""-Group suggests this, because they say it is easier on the joints and just overall safer. Some even go as far as to say that, if you are not able to keep your scapula retracted during the whole exercise you are lifting to heavy of a load. "
2543,Foam roller and massage ball,"I want to buy a foam roller and massage ball for self massage and myofascial release. What are things/features to look out for when buying these? Also, is it worth to invest in a known brand or do the cheap ones do the trick as well? "
2544,Deadlifts - should my legs ache?,"I'm trying to ascertain if my lower back is a weak point for me and my legs are strong, or that it is just that my deadlift technique is missing something.  I've been doing deadlifts once a week for about 6 weeks. I've built up to a maximum of 80kgs (176lbs), though yesterday I've been doing about 20 of these and 20 60kgs beforehand. I'm a beginner, but I do a lot of other exercises including squats and using the hamstring curl machine. I'm confident my legs are pretty strong.  As I have read, the deadlift uses most of your body and is a great compound exercise. Indeed the lift is from the power in the legs. However, my legs never ache after doing deadlifts, rather it is my mid to lower back.  I can lift the weight off the ground happily, putting the weight down is a problem and is when I feel a pull on my back - my knees are in the way. Should the bar be sliding down my thighs and over my knees, pressed against the skin?  So, after doing deadlifts should my legs ache the next day or just my back? "
2545,How can I achieve this position?,"I saw this picture:    and noticed the straight upper and lower back. My hamstrings were tight, I stretched them a lot and I am able to touch the ground almost with the palms of my hands, but I think I am compensating lacking hamstring flexibility with a round spine.  Look at me doing the same stretch.    Questions:   Can you see the bend in the lower back? How can I get rid of it? How can I isolate the hamstrings so that I don't compensate with my spine?  "
2546,Form/posture/technique for ruck running,"I am about to start with ruck running (running with a loaded backpack).   All I know about it is to build up the weight very gradually.    However, I would like to understand the proper form/posture for running with a loaded backpack. I assume shorter steps than usual. What else? Off the top of my head, I can only think of two added factors. Please add anything else you know from experience.     Should I bend forward a little more? Or instead make an effort to stay upright?  Should my strike (fore/mid/rear-foot) be modified in any way?   "
2547,How do elite athletes benefit from training (almost) every day?,"If rest is so important, why do elite athletes train every or almost every day, and some of them even multiple times a day?   I'm assuming in many sports, athletes will train every day and still be among the best in the world. How is that possible? I understand some of them are in an extraordinary shape but why wouldn't the ""rest is important"" rule apply to them as well? And especially to them if they're looking to squeeze out absolutely everything that's in their body to train themselves to be the best at what they do.  I understand some sports are combination of some kind of technique combined with strength/endurance but still.. Top MMA fighters, football player, rowers, gymnasts, swimmers, runners, I assume all the people at the top probably train every day.  PS - wasn't sure if this should perhaps be in the sports.. if yes, please move the question over there.   Thanks "
2548,How many sets and reps should I do as a beginner?,"About a year ago, I asked a question looking for a list of beginner dumbbell exercises. A user suggested this helpful website, which I promptly bookmarked. Having procrastinated for the past 10 months or so, I'm now ready to actually start doing these exercises. Having never done much of this kind of thing before, I have a few questions about routines, specifically about sets and reps.   As a beginner (with pretty terrible upper-body strength), how many reps should I start out with for each exercise? To start, I'll be doing one exercise for each muscle type the site lists. How many repetitions of each exercise is recommended for a beginner? Is there a recommended rest period between sets? If so, how long?   My ultimate goal is to improve my upper body strength. I have noodle arms at the moment, and I've only recently noticed how weak I've really become (I'm a geek and I sit at a computer all day long). That said, I'm not looking to become the next Arnold Schwarzenegger; I'm simply looking to improve my strength. Any recommendations or tips would be appreciated. "
2549,Eat before or after night gym sessions,"I have a new job in a new city and I am still trying to calibrate my schedule so all my activities could fit in. I usually finish work arount 6PM and after I got home (around 7:30 PM), I go to the gym nearby and stay there until 9:30 PM.   My problem with this routine is that I end up having dinner late at night (around 11PM) and have to go to bed before midnight so I can get my 7h hours sleep (I wake up everyday between 6 and 7 AM).   Since it is generally admitted that eating right before going to sleep is unhealthy, is it best for me to eat before going to the gym? And if that is so, is it ok not to ingest something after high intensity training? Wouldn't that affect your muscles growth? "
2550,Does it affect one's stamina to take a long break from gym?,"I had joined gym about two and a half years ago (when I was 18) where I used to workout on my arms, shoulders, chest and back. As a result of tough days with my studies, I had to discontinue my routine. Now a week has passed since I rejoined but I feel like I have lost most of my stamina. While I had accomplished to workout at least 10 reps in each set with full comfort, now it gets too hard for me to manage 6 and 8 of them almost kill me even with much less weights attached.  Is this the long break I have enjoyed that my body has gotten too lazy? Would I manage to get back what I have lost?  Note: Any suggestions to build up stamina would be greatly appreciated. "
2551,Barbell Curl Form,"I've recently began lifting weights again. When doing curls, whether it's barbell or dumbbell, my right elbow sometimes likes to try and pull away and point out to my side, once fatigue starts to set in.  What is the cause of this? I always thought my right bicep was a bit stronger than my left, but my only guess is this happens because of bicep weakness.  The only other factor I can think of is I've had quite a few right shoulder dislocations in the past, and had my labrum repaired almost four years ago. Maybe a weaker shoulder could cause this?   "
2552,Importance of flexibility,"First, some context: I'm a 32 years old developer who spends most of the day sit, go to swimming classes once a week, and does weightlifting (at home) whenever it finds time, now moving from Stronglifts to Starting Strength (but sadly not dedicating the three times a week they recommend, so I'm not doing heavy lifting yet).  From my swimming classes and paying attention to squat videos, I have realized that I lack (a lot of) flexibility in:   shoulders hips ankles   Now the questions:  1) Should I be concerned about this issue? Let's say, it's going to affect me badly when I become old.  2) If I should, then should I spend all time I have doing flexibility exercises, or can I mix them with regular strength exercises? (squat, bench press and pull ups are the ones I like the most) "
2553,what is the best routine for someone that work and studying a lot,"Hello everyone I am new here so I am developer(I make software for my client). Yesterday, my doctor said me that I need do work out everyday and eat well.  I am not expert in this area and I need help/  I get up 6 AM and then I go to school from 7 AM to 1 PM, ten I go to work from 1 PM to 9 PM.  My question:  What is the best routine for my body and feel well with my body? My doctor said that I need to work out because I am a little little fat. If I do not  work out it is bad for my body in the future.  Do you have any tips for me?  Sorry if my question is not good, but I do not know about this area(fitness) and this site is the only one I found at stackexchange about work out. If another exists, please tell me in a comments.  If my question is not complete, please tell me what I  need for a complete question. "
2554,What foods will help reduce my weight?,"I am really obese. I am 5'7"" weighing around 93 kg. I should be around 65 kg ideally, i.e I am 28 kg overweight which I want to lose. I have always been fat since my childhood so losing the weight e thing is very tough for me. I've been trying to control what I eat for some days but then I fall back into the same thing. This time I am quite serious about changing my eating habits. What foods can I eat to help reduce my weight?  I know about green tea and lemon, I've been drinking about 2 mugs of it per day. What else will be effective in losing weight? I will be really grateful. All I want is to get rid of this extra weight and curse.  "
2555,Symmetrical body workouts to compensate for imbalance,"The problem with my body is that I'm so right handed so that my left upper body almost look wasted. My MAC (Mid Arm Circumference) on my left side is 30 while my MAC on my right side is 36. It's the same with my pectoralis muscles, lattismus dorsi, etc. How can I correct this? Are there any particular workouts that I should concentrate on? "
2556,How often should one serious about bodybuilding have a cave day?,"So I am a bodybuilder and I cave every 10 days, which doesn't seem that bad really, but how often should a bodybuilder actually cave. How frequently? How rarely? "
2557,left and right shoulders are asymmetrical,My left and right shoulders are asymmetrical. My left shoulder seems attached with my upper chest perfectly whereas my right shoulder and upper chest has a gap between them. How can i make them equal? Are there any exercises to build the gap between the upper chest and shoulder near the collar bone? 
2558,Isometric finger training - individually vs collectively,"Bit of background - my training goals are ultimately geared towards climbing and max strength. Endurance and Hypertrophy are things I'm not interested in.  Right now like most climbers, I train using a hangboard where I isometrically hang from small edges for short periods of time. I increase intensity by using smaller edges or adding more weight.  I thought that working each finger in isolation would probably be an effective way to squeeze the most strength from each finger but when I looked at the anatomy of the finger flexors, the (2) main muscles that flex the fingers attach to all 4 fingers (I previously thought each finger had its own muscle).  I think my idea/goal here is clear now. So the question really is what are the advantages/disadvantages to training fingers individually? Do you think there would be a benefit training them individually vs collectively? "
2559,Is it advisable to use a therapeutic stretch band as a yoga prop?,"Is it recommended (or discouraged) to use a long therapeutic stretch band instead of a belt-style band for yoga poses?  As an example, is innovation with the strap a bad idea, such as wrapping it around the heel in revolved head-to-knee pose? "
2560,Persistent mild knee pain due to squats - push through or stop?,"Over the last 2 months or so of doing heavy squats (200 lbs - 262 lbs) I've frequently had pain in my knees. During the last 2 weeks, it's been especially persistent and seems to be mostly in my left knee. I'm normally sore after working out, especially in my legs and lower back, but the knee pain seems to persist long after the other pains go away.  What does it feel like? Well, it's on the front side of the leg, centered just below the knee cap. By ""below"" I mean ""in the direction of my foot"", not ""closer to the bone"". It's hard to describe the sensation exactly. It's kind of a pulling/burning feeling. It feels somewhat different than muscle soreness elsewhere, but I don't feel like anything's grinding or scraping or popping. It's not a ""sharp"" pain.  As far as intensity goes, it's not excruciating. Actually it's mild enough that I feel that I could ignore it when doing my squats and continue performing my workouts as planned. I'm just not sure that's a good idea. It is bad enough though that running for more than a minutes or so is a very unpleasant idea.  I do not feel any pain when standing, sitting, or walking. I do feel it whenever I ascend/descend at all. Getting up from a chair, walking up or down a flight of stairs, and of course when doing squats. I also feel it when running.  I've tried skipping a couple workouts, and although the pain seems to gradually get better with time, 5-6 days is not enough to get rid of it, and it comes right back when I resume my workouts. I had been more or less ignoring it for the last month or so, but since it's now preventing me from running, I'm getting more concerned.  I have also tried using a foam roller on the muscles surrounding my knee (but avoiding the knee itself). This seemed to help with some other pains/soreness I'd had, but not with the knee pain.  I'm 95% sure the pain is caused by my squatting. It always gets worse during/after I squat. I squat just below parallel, with a shoulder-width stance and my feet pointing outwards about 15 degrees. I try to keep my knees following that 15 degree direction, pointing in the direction of my feet, when I descend. Historically I've done 5 sets of 5 reps, but more recently I've been doing 3 sets of 5. I rest about 5 minutes in between sets.  So, should I be concerned about this, if so how should I handle it? Is it likely that I'm doing something wrong? Should I take a couple weeks off from squatting and running? Ignore it and keep going? Deload significantly and work back up so my body adapts more? See a doctor? I know you are (probably) not a doctor and not qualified to give medical advice. I'm just hoping to find out if this (1) ignorable, (2) a concern, but something that can be solved with a period of rest and/or dealoading or (3) a big problem I'll need professional help with.  Update 2011-09-09  Update: I saw an osteopathic doctor yesterday. He told me my tendons and ligaments were fine. In fact he said ""your ligaments look like they're built to take a lot of punishment!"". He diagnosed patellofemoral pain syndrome AKA ""runners knee"". He told me the inside of my knee cap had become rough. He prescribed R.I.C.E (Rest, Ice, Compression, Elevation) as well as a twice-daily stretching regimen, and weighted leg extensions 3 times a week. He also suggested I take ibuprofin, especially if I'm doing anything to aggravate my knees. He told me recovery could take 6 weeks or more, but call him if I didn't see a significant difference by the end of the month.  So at this point I'm going to follow the routine the doctor gave me for the next 6 weeks or so, and avoid squats, deadlifts, and running. I will continue doing the other exercises I'd been doing (bench press, overhead press, rows, and pull-ups). I may also try swimming if I feel like doing cardio (but I'm a terrible swimmer). After I feel I've recovered I'll start squats with about 50% of the weight I was last doing (262 lbs was my peak work weight) and I'll work my way back up. I'll have someone check my form then too.  Thanks for the answers. They helped me to realize that this wasn't something I should ignore, and that my squat form was likely at fault. I'm marking Dave's answer as ""most helpful"" for the strong suggestion to see a doctor, which I did. But I also really appreciate Berin Loritsch's answer for the form tips and the TUBOW suggestion especially.  "
2561,Is it safe to use nicotine to enhance performance?,"Nicotine seems to be a performance-enhancing drug, like caffeine. But because nicotine is associated with smoking, it seems dangerous to try a nicotine patch to get better gym results.  Is it safe? And if so, how should I dose it? Are there any unwanted side effects? "
2562,"Is Lifting Weights at Home, Without a Rack, A Viable Option For Me?","The gyms in my area are overcrowded and full of smith machines. Some of the cheaper ones don't even have smith machines. I've decided to lift weights at home, but I have a limited amount of space and don't quite yet want to invest in a rack.  I have a few questions...   If I get a small barbell like the C70 from Rogue, would I be okay with doing only the following exercises?   Deadlift Bent Over Row Overhead Press    Obviously I'd be missing out on squats and the bench press, but (here comes the next few questions)   Can doing more dead lifts act a substitute for squats? Can push-ups act as a substitute for the bench press? Can anyone speak about their experience with the Rogue C70? Can I do all of the above exercises with it, even though I'm just about 6'0? If none of the above sounds like it would give me a proper full body workout, should I simply aim to use kettlebells or dumbbells instead?   Thank you all for reading and for your help! "
2563,"Is it possible to do too many jumping jacks, and can I do them in rest days?","I am not good at rope-jumping so in order to warm up before my medium intensity training (some push-ups, some ab activities, etc) I do jumping jacks, sometimes up to 150 of them. I count every move, one for opening legs one for closing them.  Is it possible to do too many jumping jacks? Can I do them in rest days? Do they interfere with my muscle recovery? "
2564,Legs wearing out too soon in freestyle,I'm learning swimming (only freestyle) since December last year. The problem is I'm unable to swim continuously even for 30m.    Here is how I swim   Push off the wall Kick for few meters (no arm action) Start arm action with my first breath Breath after every 4 arm action (for three breaths only) Stop because of tired legs     Breathing was a problem in the beginning. Now I have the rhythm and proper head rotation (at least I think so). I'm guided by a coach and he tells me that I'm gaining strength and it will take a little longer for me to catch up with others.    Are there any particular swimming drills that I can do to recover from this situation?  I was thinking using kickboard might build strength in my legs - looks like it is not helping or I'm doing something wrong with the kickboard  I learnt backstroke on my own (through YouTube videos) and able to do 50m comfortably. Why my legs mess up when doing freestyle?   
2565,Training On Saturday and Sunday,"I've been lifting for a couple of months, Mon-Wed-Fri, no problem.   I changed jobs and now I'm thinking about changing it to Sat-Wed-Sun — I am a lot busier on weekdays now.  I know it will impede my progress.   I know it's not optimal.  But I don't mind too much, becuase I'm expecting it not to matter that much.   Will it be fine? Should I expect progress to be really slow? Or would it be best to lift Sat-Wed and keep Sunday for prehab? "
2566,Working out at the playground?,"So I am having financial trouble and don't want to pay for a gym membership, so I'm wondering about working out at the playground. I would probably be doing pull ups, decline push ups, one legged squats, knee tucks, dips, chin ups, and incline push ups. I should note that these exercises would be accompanied with running a mile and a half around a track and that all of these exercises are about 3-15 repetitions. The workout excluding the running would be about 45 minutes long, 6 days a week. Is this satisfactory enough to build muscles up? I should note that I used to lift weights recently, and my body is already sort of built up. Also, how many dips should I be able to do each day without causing a shoulder injury? "
2567,What is a good DVD based fitness video program for me?,"About me:  I am 36 years old, male, 173cm, 74 kg. Did lots of intense sports during High-School (Basketball, Running, Fitness, Cycling, and ""fun sports"" like skateboarding). After High-School, stopped completely. I work at the computer the whole day, sitting, only time I move is when going by bicycle 15 mins to work. Now I really want to start to do exercise again.  My goals:  1.) General, overall fitness. This is clearly my main goal.   2.) Some weight reduction, I want to weigh below 68 kg, but I think this will come as a side effect anyway so I am not necessarily interested in a weight-loss program.  3.) Slight overall muscle increase. Again, I think this will come as a side effect of 1.) anyway and I am not interested in a ""six-pack"", ""being ripped"" or crap like that.  Background of my question:  I really want to train at home with a DVD-based program. A fitness club is absolutely not an option, I am simply not interested in going there. I would like to do jogging, but it is very problematic because of the area where I live. So I tried different things, and finally decided that maybe the best and most hassle-free way for me to exercise again would be at home! And I think a DVD-based program could help much.  I took a look at a couple of products: Power 90 with David Horton looks very good, this is kind of what I am looking for but there is very little variety (basically one out of four possible videos every day), and the exercises are simply too long (40 mins every day)! I would like to start with ~25 mins per day, or 40 mins every two days.  I also had a look at P90X and Insanity. These program are way too advanced for me. But what I really like is that they have so many different exercises. Is there anything with as much variety as P90X/Insanity, but which can also be done by people like me who are too unfit yet for this level?  I also tried the Kinetic and Kinetic Combat products for the PS2. These are just fantastic, I would love to do them, but I could never get them to work properly with the video camera.  That's basically all the products I know, interesting stuff but still not exactly what I'm looking for.  Is there any DVD-based program you can recommend for me?  P.S.: I would also be interested what you think in general about training at home with DVDs. "
2568,"Why does the Bill Starr Rehab protocol work, if it does?","From here and other places around the internet, the Bill Starr rehab protocol for muscle-belly injuries is described like this:     Wait 3-4 days until the pain starts to “blur”, which   indicates that the immediate process of healing has stopped the   bleeding and has started to repair the tissue. Then use an exercise   that directly works the injury, [...] in this case   the squat. Use the empty bar and do 3 sets of 25 with perfect form,   allowing yourself NO favoring the injured side. If it’s ready to rehab   you will know by the pain: if the pain increases during the set, it’s   not ready, if it stays the same or feels a little better toward the   end of the set, it is ready to work.      The NEXT DAY do it again, and add a small amount of weight, like 45 x   25 x 2 , 55 x 25. Next day, 45 x 25, 55 x 25, 65 x 25. Continue adding   weight every day, increasing as much as you can tolerate each workout.   It will hurt, and it’s supposed to hurt, but you should be able to   tell the difference between rehab pain and re-injury. If you can’t,   you will figure it out soon enough. This method works by flushing   blood through the injury while forcing the tissue to reorganize in its   normal pattern of contractile architecture.      After 10 days of 25s, go up in weight and down in reps to 15s, then to   10s, and finally to fives. During this time do NO OTHER HEAVY WORK, so   that your resources can focus on the injury. You should be fixed in   about 2 weeks, squatting more than you hurt yourself with.      This method has the advantage of preventing scar formation in the   muscle belly, since the muscle is forced to heal in the context of   work and normal contraction, using the movement pattern it normally   uses. The important points are 1.) perfect form with 2.) light weights   that can be handled for high reps, 3.) every day for two weeks, and   4.) no other heavy work that will interfere with the system-wide processes of healing the tear.      It is also very important through the whole process of healing the   injury that ice be used, during the initial phase after the injury and   after the workouts. Use it 20 on/20 off, many times a day at first and   then tapering off to morning, after the workout, and before bed. Ice   is your best friend in a muscle belly injury, holding down   inflammation and fluid accumulation (“swelling”) while at the same   time increasing beneficial blood flow through the injury. But DO NOT   USE ICE MORE THAN 20 MINUTES AT A TIME. More than that can cause more   damage than it repairs.      This may actually be the most useful post on this entire little forum   of mine, and if you use this method exactly you can save yourself many   weeks of lost training and long-term problems with muscle-belly   scarring.   (I don't know if I've pasted too much, but I thought it's useful for this question.)  My questions:   Is there a controlled study that compares full rest (no activity, just icing), vs active recovery (stretching, massaging, foam rolling, range of motion work), vs loaded recovery (this protocol)? Is there actually a danger that the muscle will heal improperly if you don't work it under progressively heavier loads during recovery? (I know this protocol claims this is the case.) I'd be happy with just some pointers to other evidence that this is the case. Does this protocol prevent scar tissue formation? (Again, I know it claims to.) A good answer would talk about how scar tissue forms after a muscle belly injury, and how movement, or movement under load may prevent it (or not prevent it).  "
2569,How hard can I train during fasting?,"How hard can I train during fasting, without diminishing training results too much?  I am mostly thinking of multi-day fasts, but also when I plan to fast in the morning or have calorie-deficit the day after.  (Not fasted training per se)  Should I look at special protocols with eg amino acids or Collagen?  What I often do, is to cut reps/set to 70-80% of max in my slightly eccentric resistance training program.  At the same time, I train more like circuit training, with intermixing exercises and shorter breaks.  I know the best, at least for fatloss, is to burn calories with minimum stress and damage, but I do this to maintain my level and ""repeated-bout effect"", so that I can train hard a few days later with little DOMS.

2571,Running first thing in the morning,"I am currently training for a marathon.  Due to a change in my schedule starting Dec 1, mornings will be the only time I can run.  I heard that it takes about an hour for the body to absorb water, so currently on weekends I drink 24oz of water right when I wake up, urinate, then go run.  However, on the weekdays this doesn't seem so feasible:  Wake up -> Drink water -> wait an hour -> run 10 miles -> shower/eat -> drive to work  Seems like an extremely early morning.  Is there any way to make it better?  Is it really necessary to wait a whole hour after drinking water? "

2574,Weighted Ruck Marches / Hiking for Aerobic Exercise,"I've grown incredibly bored with your more traditional cardio exercises:  running, swimming, cycling, elliptical, et cetera.  I'm traditionally a weight lifter, but the aerobic side is suffering due to disinterest.  As an alternative, I've considered trying weighted ruck marching / hiking.  This isn't meant to take advantage of some benefit that weighted marching offers above other types of cardio, just as a different angle on the same old cardio problem.  I have seen a program (primarily intended for those entering the military) that would proceed as follows:   Week 1-3: 20% bodyweight x5 miles Week 4-6: 25% x5 miles Week 7-9: 30% x5 miles Week 10-12: 40% x5 miles (do not exceed 40% of BW) Week 13-14: 40% x6 miles Week 15-16: 40% x7 miles Week 17-18: 40% x8 miles Week 19-20: 40% x10 miles Week 21-22: 40% x12 miles Week 23-24: 40% x15 miles   Does the above-listed plan sound reasonable to those experienced?  Does anyone use this exercise for conditioning?  Any tips or advice to share?  Thanks "
2575,Good amount of sets and repetitions for different muscle groups,"About 10 years back, when I went to my first gym, the trainers told me to do 3 or 4 sets with about 8 to 15 repetitions on 3 different machines for each group of muscles, depending on the goals I want to achieve.  Now I wonder if this rule is true for every muscle group, because the muscles are so different. The small biceps gets exhausted pretty quickly while I can do a lot more repetitions when I train my stomach muscles. It feels like different muscles need a different amount or type of training. Is this correct and are there some guides I can use for orientation? Or am I over thinking this and my standard approach of 3 sets with 12 repetitions on 3 machines works well for everything? I am most concerned about stomach training and training my leg muscles.  Edit: Adding more information as requested. I am currently trying to do the first exercise without a machine (barbells for example) and the other two with a machine. I am currently targeting my upper body (breast, shoulders, upper and lower back, stomach) to gain some muscle and stability and also train my legs to gain more elasticity for sprinting, because I play flag football and need to be fast.  My usual workout consists of 3 groups of muscles. Yesterday I started with shoulders (3 exercises, 3 sets, 12 reps), proceeded to upper back (3 exercises, 3 sets, 12 reps) and finally stomach (3 exercises, 3 sets, 15 reps). Warm-up consists of about 10 to 15 minutes on the cardio bike and cool-down is the same, with additional stretching. "
2576,How to do standing military press without damaging back?,"So whenever I do standing military press with any weight, it seems to kind of tear at my back. Not my lower back, but maybe my upper or middle. Anyone with similar experiences?How do I avoid this? Am I using proper form? "
2577,Core training - planks vs. L-sits?,Does the L-sit:    overlap with the plank:    or do these two exercises complement each other well?  Is there any benefit to holding planks that can't be obtained by holding L-sits? 
2578,Determine weaker muscle group,"I've heard that it's useful to determine your weakest muscle group and to work more on it. Sometimes it can been clearly seen, but if not, how do I actually do it? Is there some approximate proportions of weights in different exercises to find out which muscle groups is relatively weaker? "
2579,Do muscles discriminate against the type of micro-tear?,"Weightlifting creates micro-tears in the muscles. When these micro-tears repair, the muscle grows back bigger. Does this same principle apply to tears caused by other means? For example, if you create micro-tears from overstretching cold muscles, does that also stimulate hypertrophy? If not, please explain biologically how muscles discriminate against the type of micro-tear. "
2580,Does one exercise per body part work?,"Does one exercise per body part work?   I met a guy at the gym who does only one exercise per body part and he is huge and very ripped. He has been working out for long time though. He is also purely natural does not even take supplements. His protein mainly comes from Eggs, Soya and chicken.  On asking him about his workouts. He says he like to keep it simple and does only one exercise per body part and works out each part twice a week and exercises 6 days a week.  He follows a pyramidical approach to working out. On his way up he does REPS of 10,8,6,4,2 and continues to add weight and then he reduces weight for each set and increases the REPS from 2,4,6,8,10.  His program looks like :   Monday : Bench Press, Skull crushers, Pull overs.  Tuesday : Overhead Press, Squats OR Deadlift  Wednsesday : T-Bar Rows, Shrugs and Preacher curls.   Repeats the same and takes a day off on sunday.  He does his AB Work every morning at home. He also changes his program every 3 months. Keeps the program same but changes the exercises.  Does this routine make sense? Can it add both add size and make someone ripped? "
2581,Why do I feel my arms burn after doing a lot of push ups?,"So I have noticed that I am doing far beyond 20 reps of push ups and still, after I have done about 50 of them, or even 2 sets of 25 my arms feel like they're expanding and growing muscle, both the biceps and triceps. This is confusing to me because I thought that over 20 reps only builds stamina and endurance, not stronger muscles. If this is the case, why do my arms feel like they're growing? Are they? "
2582,Recovering from rolled ankle,"I very recently rolled my ankle playing basketball. It is nothing serious, but in the wake of the injury my ankle has definitely been hurting when I walk.

2583,What would be the most time efficient exercise regime and pre-game energy intake in order to increase stamina for soccer?,"I mainly play on small courts, so there's a lot of short sprinting, changing direction rapidly etc. So while my first thought to build up stamina is simply to run long distance, I'm wondering if there is a more time-efficient way dependent on the sport?  Also, in terms of energy input before games, what are some good recommendations? I generally just throw sugar at myself within 30-60minutes pregame, chocolate bar + lucozade / pocari sweat. I'm sure these make some difference as I definitely feel more lethargic much sooner without any pre-game sugar, however I'd like to try and refine this as well, in terms of timing, amount, type etc. "
2584,Can you gain size without correct eating plans/schedules?,As the title states. Is it possible to gain muscle if for example I eat 80% of the recommended calories and protein etc.. and I don't eat before/after the gym would I ever build muscle?  I do follow the correct steps on most days but I'm wondering on days where I slack off is progress completely non-existent? Is it even worth going if you're not going to eat before and after?  Sorry theres a few questions merged into one. 
2585,Multiple Workouts During Work,"I would like to do multiple workouts throughout the day (let's say 4-8 times) when I'm at work. My office has a gym with free weights. The workouts can be from 5-10 minutes long.  I know the importance of taking frequent breaks, but either walking or doing stairs doesn't seem sufficient for my upper body. I still get stiff shoulders/neck even though I'm taking these frequent breaks.  I also do real workouts outside of work, 4 days out of the week.  So my question is, what sort of plan would be effective irrespective of stiff shoulder/neck? I don't see too much material, if there is anything it's usually these body weight exercises that only seem good for someone who isn't in shape or actually lifts weights.  What would be better than a stiff shoulder/neck than lifting weights? Maybe stretches would be better? "
2586,Can occasional intervals of physical exercise increase focus and therefore intelligence?,Somewhere I heard that doing some physical exercise can help de stress and focus on other work. Is this true? What are the reasons behind this? 
2587,"How to breathe in lifts requiring tight core (squats, deadlifts)","I am a bit confused about the correct breathing technique in lifts that require core strength.   Take the squat as example:   1) Some people say that it is very important to breathe in at the top of the movement, then hold the breath until when you go down until you come up again to the straight position. Then you should breath out. The air should go into the stomach and you should contract the abs at the same time. The reason for this is that the air and the ab contraction increases the intra-abdominal pressure. This leads to a thight core which protects the spine. Additionally this gives you a bit more power for your lift (I guess about 10 percent). However doing this also increases the blood pressure which in turn can lead to cerebrovascular accident or hemorrhoids and simliar things concerning the blood vessels. It can also lead to oxygen deficit in the brain...  Because of this risks, the general advice in training is  2) breathe in on relaxion and breathe out under load. I also found this advice in the german book ""Differenzierte Kraftraining"" by Axel Gottlob. Where also squats and deadlifts are discussed in depth.   3) Sometimes the variant is suggested to hold the breathe on the bottom and very slowly breath out on the way up.   4) Another variant is to breathe into your stomach as you are standing straight, tighten your abs and let some air go out again, then hold it until you are up again.   5) The last advice I have heared is just not to think about it but breathe just naturally. If I try this, I end up in breathing multiple times during the lift which feels to be wrong. However I can keep my abs contracted while breathing, so my spine should still be protected, isn't it?  So I am very confused about this topic and need an authorative answer how to do it in detail and why. And what is about the concerns I have with the different kinds of breathing technique: Better spine protection but higher blood pressure or vice versa...  I guess that the first method is the best for professional power- or weightlifters.   But I am interested in training for hypertropy for general health and just for fun. So if you don't lift your 1rep max and choose instead of it a weight where you can do 8-15 reps (and 4 sets), which technique would be the most healthy one and why?  How does the risk for the spine increases in this case when I don't hold the breath during the lift?  Edit: To understand the subject completely: How does the recommended speed of execution relates to the breathing technique and to the possible dangerous. For example if you hold your breath, it may be better to execute the lift quickly since this seems to me to reduce the risks associated with holding the breath during the lift... "
2588,Feeling my chest being built during dips?,"So dips are supposed to hit triceps, right? Well today at my gym I did about 40 of them and my chest still feels like its expanding right now, but my triceps don't. Is this normal? Can dips be hitting chest instead of triceps for some reason? "
2589,What happened to Kettlebell swings?,"A few years ago, Kettlebell swings were the big new thing in fitness.  Some people were saying that swings are the perfect full body exercise.  However, at the gym I go to in Portland, OR, I rarely see anybody doing swings.  The gym has about a dozen kettlebells and they just sit there.  Did kettlebells just fall out of fashion, like so many other fads in fitness?  I asked the gym owner about this, and he suggested that the reason people aren't doing swings is that they got hurt.  What do you think?  Just the vicissitudes of fashion, or injuries, or something else?  "
2590,"How long does ""warm-up"" last?","We all know you shouldn't stretch cold, but for how long after a moderate workout does your warm-up last?  Can you have good stretches more than a few hours after exercise (without having to warm up to do the stretches again?). "
2591,Ideal target weight to start running (C25k),"I'm a 24 year old male, roughly 6'0"" and 235 pounds. I've been more active in the past, but grad school and a recent shoulder surgery, plus a completely sedentary desk job, have caused me to gain a good bit of weight.  I've done couch to 5k before, and I'd like to do it again to get back into running and to get in shape in general. However, I know running overweight is not ideal, and of course I'd like to avoid more injuries than I already have.   Would starting c25k be okay for someone of my weight, assuming I take it slow? If not, what might a target weight be I should look for after which it should be ""safe"" for me to start running again? "
2592,How is it possible to use a higher percentage of our theoretical strength?,"I've read somewhere ( Why is muscle size not proportional to strength?) that under normal circumstances, even when we try our hardest, we can use only 20-30% of our strength.  Under what circumstances can we use a higher percentage of our strength?  (My question is targeted at pull-ups and chin-ups but of course I believe the concept applies everywhere.) "
2593,Strengthening rotator cuffs - other muscles taking over?,"I try to strengthen my rotator cuff muscles in order to prevent injuries when lifting weights. I do some internal as well as external rotation movements with an elastic band before my actual workout.  With the right arm, I can really feel the muscles in the back of my shoulder and to some degree at my shoulder blades working when performing the movement. However with the left arm, it kind of fields like my bi- and triceps are taking over and doing the main work. I don't feel the muscles of the rotator cuff working at all. Rather a burning feeling on the inside of my upper arm (kind of a burning feeling like when you do a reps on an exercise and your muscles fatigue).  Since, from what my gym buddy and I can see, I'm performing the movements exactly the same I'm guessing it's not a technique problem. Otherwise it would occur in both arms, right? I'm also trying to grip the band at the same length so the resistance is the same for both arms.  Is this a common issue? Am I doing something wrong? How can I fix this? "
2594,Is sleep actually vital to muscle growth?,"I think personally it is mainly diet and weights that contribute to muscle growth. Is sleep that important of a factor too? Are there substitutes for sleep, like meditation, for example? "
2595,Will running affect my weight training and burn muscle instead of fat?,"How much gap should there be between weight training and cardio?  Usually I work out 5 days a week in the morning and sometimes do cardio and some days do weights, but I have been thinking about going for a run during lunch and lifting weights every morning.  So my question really is: Will my running cancel out the benefits of my weightlifting or burn muscle instead of fat? "
2596,How do I minimize calf muscle pain as I get back into running?,"I just started running again, all last week and again today. I start off slow, then increase the speed gradually. Very shortly into it my calves start to hurt incredibly. It starts after about 2 minutes and by 10 minutes I have to stop because its too bad (I am running slow too, only about a half mile in the 10 minutes.)  I used to be in the Army and we ran everyday. I was never a strong runner but it was always I would run out of breath or get abdominal cramps, but I never had any pain in my legs.  I got out of the Army over 5 years ago and haven't done much exercise since. So I am guessing the pain is from the muscles no longer being used to it.  If that is the case, what is the best way to break them in? Should I just keep running and they will eventually get better or is there other exercises I can do? "
2597,Equipment for deadlifts with arm injury,"At the very beginning of this video [website]My (tightly related) questions are: is this the best option for a person with a missing or injured or otherwise unusable arm to deadlift?  Are there other harness types?  Can their usage lead to more injury (spine, shoulder blades)?  Googling for «deadlifts for the disabled» «deadlift arm injury» etc did not turn up anything, and stores for sporting goods for the disabled somehow avoid weight lifting altogether.  There is a «multi-strap» thing here [website]"
2598,Is this fitness program balanced in which muscles it hits?,"Here is what I am doing:  Day 1 - Chest and Biceps   Dumbbell Press 5x5 Incline Dumbbell Press 3x8 Cable Flys 4x12 Weighted Chinups 4x8 Bicep Curls 4x8 Reverse Cable Curls 3x10 Leg Raises 3x15 Split Squats 4x8   Day 2 - Exercise bike intervals - 30 minutes  Day 3 - Back and Abs   Deadlifts 3x5 Weighted Pullups 4x8 One-Arm Dumbbell Rows 3x8 Lat Pulldowns 4x10 Decline Crunch 3x15 Split Squats 4x8 Romanian Deadlifts 3x8   Day 4 - Exercise bike intervals - 30 minutes  Day 5 - Shoulders, Triceps, and Abs   Barbell Shoulder Press 4x6 Dumbbell Lateral Raise 4x8 Upright Rows 3x10 Skull Crushers 3x8 Dips 3x12 Rope Extension 3x10 Romanian Deadlifts 3x8   Day 6 - Jog on treadmill - 30 minutes  Day 7 - Rest  I have a number of questions:   I have modeled the rep ranges and exercises after this link. Should I be keeping everything constant at 3x8/4x8 (with the exception of some of the 5x5/4x6 compound movements)? If not, how would you tweak the rep ranges? My ratio of squats:romanian deadlifts:deadlifts is 2:2:1. Is this a good ratio? Is there any muscle group that I am missing or hitting too much? I would like for this program to be as balanced as possible in what parts of the body it hits. How would you recommend switching up the exercises? Is doing that much cardio after hitting legs bad?  "
2599,Running speed - treadmill vs outdoor,"I've found that by running comfortably on a treadmill for 30 minutes, I average 9 km/h, and I've tested this on several different treadmills.  When I go running outside, RunKeeper or some other tracking device tell me my pace is closer to 11 km/h , 12 km/h.  I'm wondering what the likely reason for this? Perceived difficulty is different between the two, device(s) are not accurate, having to propel yourself forwards means you naturally go faster?? "
2600,Knee Injury Recovery (possibly MCL),"I injured my knee during running (I'd say overuse). When resting, I can feel it only when extending the knee, maybe at 150°. It's inner knee pain, close to the kneecap but not under it. From googling, I think it is MCL. I can't see any swelling, so it must be very light if any. It's not painful nor limiting when walking but I can't run without pain longer than 15 minutes.  The only problem is that it happened again after a recovery. I believe I must have done something wrong during the recovery (2 weeks), not stretched enough before the run. After the first recovery (no pain or discomfort at all) I went for a light jog only but it started hurting again after those 15 minutes. I walked back with little discomfort, but no pain.  I've google all kinds of exercises for knee pain and strengthening, I have ibuprofen and ice packs. I need to know:   How often should I do the exercises? I have a sedentary job. Is there any reason to ice the knee when there is no swelling? Is it better to keep the knee warm? (it's winter here now) Should I eat non-inflammatory pills if the pain is fine and again no visible swelling?     If I can't fully recover this time, I am going to see a doctor to rule out other problems. "

2602,Question about my pull up bar,"So I am a beginner when it comes to pull ups and I can't even do one. Currently I am doing pull up training to do my first pull up \o/  Yesterday I adopted a new pull up training method. This method mainly requires you to do 2 things-  1) Dead hangs- Jump up to the bar, hold it and keep hanging for 5-10 sec, then get back down and jump up again, do this 10 times, then during the 11th and 12th rep hang for as long as you can. Then rest and do the set again.  2) Negatives- Keep a chair/bench a little distance away from the pull-up bar, step on it with both legs and hold the bar. Then jump up to get your chin over the pull up bar and come down as slow as you can back to the chair. Repeat.  Now I think that the jump up part in both these exercise is important because when you jump up and hold the bar in mid air, while coming down you have to resist against the momentum to reach the hanging position. And thats where the problem comes. Here is a pic of my pull up bar    I couldn't actually find a pull up bar or find a place to fit it somewhere so I used the ladder of my previous bunk bed :P I didn't feel like buying one as I would go to the gym in some months anyway.   But as you can see, my improvised pull up bar has two bars on it. Now normally when I do pull up training I use the lower one as my body fits quite nicely in it and I don't really have to raise / jump to reach the bar. But now, in this new training method, I have to jump and for that I have to use the upper bar. But when I try to do these exercises on the upper bar, the part of my arm around the elbow clashes with the lower bar and its really difficult for me to do pull ups like that. Also my posture is ruined by that.  So, this is the problem. Should I move the bar a little bit higher so that I can jump up to the lower bar, or am I just overthinking and is jumping up really not that important? I am asking this because in most of the youtube tutorials they say ""jump up and hold the bar"". They don't really give an emphasis on ""jump up"" but still..I wanna be on the safe side. Sorry if this question sounds a little weird...   Here is the video link just in case you want to watch it and get a better idea of what I am saying. Its 6 mins long- [website]Thanks for helping :D "

2604,"Flat dumbbell press and incline dumbbell press (45°) [retraction,weights motion path]","How to retract my scapula?  On YouTube people often show retraction in such a way that it creates an ass-crack in between the shoulder blades, but when I try to retract like them, I retract but such retraction really limits the range of motion (while maintaining such retraction, you can't squeeze the chest when dumbbells moving upward to near the lockout position and motion of dumbbells get limited towards this downward position)  Please Explain the correct way to retract the shoulder blades.    Path of motion of dumbbells  Flat bench What is the correct path of motion of dumbbells?  Is it an arch in which dumbbells's motion starts just below the nipples and reaches the middle chest at top position?  Incline at 45°  I don't have any idea please say something about the motion of path in this case and I get a good amount of stimulation in front delts and pain in left humerous just below the lateral head.

2605,What is the right kind of protein for that job?,There are so many kinds of protein available in the market that it does your head in . I have done my homework but still not sure as to when to use which one. Following is what I have understood so far  There are two primary forms in layman (which I am)terms we can call them Fast Release proteins and Slow Release Proteins  Fast Release protiens  They are derived from Whey protein.Whey protein itself is also a form of it and Hydrolyzed Whey Protein Isolate being semi digested with enzymes and is the quickest but most expensive one in the market. Fast proteins are ideal for Post or Pre-workout and are usually digested in 30 minutes by the body. So after workout peaked metabolism gives the best possible window for this usage.These are best taken with water as milk can slow them down.  Slow Release Proteins  Usually have Casein in them . Which is a substance which becomes a gel in the intestines and slows down the digestion process thus making these proteins slow release.  My question are below  1- Why does it matter how long protein digestion takes? is it because we do not want it to be released faster than body can absorb or needs?  2- I see super fit people at work taking Whey proteins around mid morning or lunch or mid afternoon. I know for the fact these people do not work out at these times. I also do not believe that these people would have less knowledge than myself. But if I am right having a Whey protein shake for lunch when I know they have not worked out in past 6 hours and can not go for run or workout in an other 6 hours is total waste or is it? What am I missing?  3- I am actually looking for weight loss I am thinking of getting a slow 4hour release shake around 9.00Am  and an other after lunch time (replacing the lunch) is that right way to go for me . I work out 7.30 AM Monday to Friday. 
2606,Running the same day as lifting weights?,"I am interesed in getting prepared for a 10km race, and also increase the muscles size of my shoulders and arms.  For this, I am working at home with weights to work shoulders and triceps one day, rest next day, biceps and pectoral third day, and rest one day.  Before the weights, I am running about 6 km (33 minutes).  My question is: is this the best way to increase the muscles size? should I rather run the days in which I am resting now instead of the same day in which I do weights?  Thank you! "
2607,Increase in Belly size after workout,"My workout includes exercises to increase muscle strength. I am trying to gain weight by following a specified diet and working out as instructed.  My muscles are growing slowly but I don't have any issue with that. The problem is I am a Computer Engineer and I have to sit all through the day programming. Probably, due to this, I have a slight increase in belly size at the end of the day. Why is it so?   To maintain a flat belly through out the day in the case where I have to sit in a single place for a long time, is there any way I can achieve that?  Also I want to know, what causes the increase in belly size temporarily and what are ways to keep a flattened belly throughout the day (the way it looks after workout)? "

I wonder if a man with swimwear with abs,chest,biceps and more if is attracted to the most women. Example the most of us if we see a woman which is tall,she is little fatter and she has nice body we say she is amazing. For men especially for muscles guys this happens too or the women doesn't care about the muscle a man has? If a women attracted by muscles which muscles should I give emphasis? I am not workout only about women but I care and about this :) I want to be more attracted to them. thanks In advance :) "
2609,Whats the ideal temperature for running in high humidity?,"If running at 50-60 deg F is ideal for a marathon in low humidity (RH &lt; 60%) then what is the ideal temp for high humidity (RH > 60%) ?    Is it the same?    It is the same but the value is more like 40-45F not 60F. I was mentally stuck on a number of 60F that Ive heard about some long time ago, so I didnt even read the article close enough. My personal fastest times came with temps around 45F.  Loved the NOAA heat index provided by brentwpeterson; it was right on target. Once again I had a heat index table and some other methodology that didnt match up with what I was seeing. The NOAA heat index is spot on. My area is +95% RH nearly every morning and I definitely notice the ramp up in heat just above 80F. Plus the increase in heat index due to the sun and decrease due to wind is something Ive noticed as well. The impact on pace is dramatic, and for me at the time I wasnt drinking properly making it even worst.  One note for people reading this and trying to deal with humidity. From my experience short fast runs 3-4 miles doesnt have the same dramatic impact that longer runs have. My 5k speed is progressing evenly through all seasons and it definitely depends more one training than weather, so summer is for speedwork I guess and learning how to do the ultra shuffle for long runs.  "
2610,Fastest walk / jog ratio,"I've been going for long jogs (around 7 km - the length of a local track), but I can only jog around 5km, which means I spend a lot of time walking as well.  I was wondering if how to choose to spend the 2km worth of walking effects my overall time. E.g. it is better to jog without stopping completely, and then walk another 2km, or is it better to run 1km, walk a little, run another 1km etc ??  Or does 5 minutes jog / 5 minutes walk make more sense? "
2611,How often should I go bouldering (including a little core strength training),"I recently picked up bouldering contrasting my distance running training quite nicely.  From my run training I learned that training about every other day seems to give really good results, but how about bouldering?  Let me sketch out my current bouldering training:   Do a little stretching and 1 or 2 easy boulders for warm up. I also ride my bike 4-8 km to the bouldering hall and count that as warm up as well. Either do boulders of medium difficulty in order to improve my moves or work on the ones I can't finish yet. I do this until I notice that I loosing the strength required. This happens after 4-10 boulders. Do easy boulders; until I'm really exhausted. Do some core strength training (planks, situps, legups ...)   The goal of all this is in roughly this order:   Have fun (which requires avoiding serious injuries, since those aren't fun) Improve my bouldering, ie. be able to climb more difficult boulders Improve my strength. I won't mind loosing some weight, but that is not the main goal of this activity.   So the question is: How often should I do training like this for optimum effect? Once a week? Every other day? Twice a day?  My actual training schedule is mostly defined by other things, but sometimes there is a lot of free time available and I want to be able to use that as well as possible. "
2612,Can one calculate the energy expenditure of specific lifts?,"So I was wondering if there are formulas to calculate the energy expenditure of common lifts, like deadlifts, bench press, squat etc. I know that every formula could only be an approximation, due to differing technique, execution speed etc.  I was just curious if such formulas exist and if so, how accurate they are.  If they don't exist, why is that? Did just noone care to find out? Is it not feasible due to one of the factors mentioned above (or other factors), if so which? "
2613,How can I increase shoulder flexibiity for squats & snatches?,"I have noticed flexbility is a big issue for me in squatting as well as snatching (I cannot snatch at all currently).  For example, if I squat with no weight, I cannot complete a squat with my arms pointing to the ceiling.  However, with my arms by my side I can go very deep past parallel comfortably.  In my weighted barbell squats I have found widening my grip on the barbell allows me to squat more comfortably because of the flexbility explained in the paragraph above.  But how can I increase the flexibility of my shoulders so I don't have to do this?  Exercises? Stretches? Is it impossible?  Hope the question makes sense. "
2614,How to lose weight while being hungry after exercising heavily?,"I exercise frequently: running, cycling, football at least 5 days a week.  However, I have a sizable gut. This is due to a few factors: I sit all day at work, high calorie intake from soft drink and other junk food (usually on the weekends for lunch, not every day), Aussie love of beer. I think I only need to lose about 5 - 8 kg.  In the past week or so I have cut out the soft drink, beer and cut out junk food on weekends. However, from day one that I stopped drinking soft drink and my daily beer with my evening meal I noticed that I am voraciously hungry. I have been eating almost two evening meals because I am so hungry.  I may be way off the mark, but my assumption is the body is trying to compensate for the calories it is loosing from me dropping the soft drinks.  Now I'm confused as to what I should be doing. It seems counterproductive for me to eat more food while I am trying to lose weight, but I'm just so damn hungry.  Here is a typical before and after of what I have removed and what I have added to give you some indication of what I am eating to compensate:  Before:   Equivalent of 2 cans of coke per day 1 beer per day Added 1x spoonfull of sugar to my breakfast cereal   After:   2 extra pieces of fruit (banana, orange, pear, apple etc.) Extra medium serve of rice with boiled vegetables approx. 1 hour after my evening meal Extra slice of bread or plain biscuits or handful of nuts   My diet is otherwise pretty healthy: plenty of fruit, veg and water  It seems I have just replaced calorie for calorie with better options, but am I going to lose weight in this way?  Is there anything that can be described as high energy low calorie food that I would be better eating instead? I prefer something non-processed (no shakes, energy bars etc.) "
2615,Need a solution to help keep my run training program going!,"All the hindrances involved in a training program for running during the summer I've been able to get around to some degree expect for one. A heat index of +90 deg F for nearly every run is taking a toll. -- I should have mentioned the humidity is always +90% RH for the daily low temp and about 60-70% (?) for the daily high. -- The wife is compounding it with complaints and even the cat's liter is getting involved! I've been kicked out of the master bathroom which is fine I guess.      After a run I have no idea how to get my running clothes dry and stored without stinking up the bathroom, getting mold in the hamper, getting mold in the running clothes when hanging outside, destroying wall hangers or clothes hangers with salt water corrosion, creating a stream of salt corrosion going out the door and down the back patio, plastering the floor when the cat decides to excessively kick litter out of the litter box onto a pool of sweat, and creating water marks on the laminate flooring due to wet socks.    Im wondering how other people deal with this. Preferably with the consideration that its both hot and humid outside, but something as an answer would be better than nothing.    Peace :)     My solution which is insufficient to someone is to hang my clothes up on a hanger in the shower immediately and use a towel just for cleaning up sweat and to walk around the house. This doesn't work when there is company though. Where are the close voters at? The economy really must be doing better. Plus I've been forced to use shoe deodorant now (which I'm grateful). Next I think I'll add a step to rinse out the clothes since they are hanging in the shower.    Rinsing the clothes is the best thing to do. Thanks StackExchange!! "
2616,Pull-ups: go all the way down?,Should you go all the way down when doing pull-ups or chin-ups? Or should you stop when your arms are at 90 degrees? 
2617,Ice in protein shake,I recently over heard a discussion about how mixing ice in your protein shake will make it much harder to burn off the fat in your body.  Something about the fact that ice freezes the fat.  Is this just a myth or true?  I would imagine that the more ice and cold water you consume the more calories you burn and more fat.  Which one is true? 
2618,How can I loosen stiff piriformis and iliopsoas using a myofascial release technique without dry needling?,"Due to flat feet and leg length asymmetry I have , my right piriformis and iliopsoas is almost always stiff. I discovered this issue at an age of 29 and the issue is being solved by foot insoles which already help tremendously.  Currently, I visit my physician once in 2 to 3 weeks for a dry needling session to loosen the gluteal area. After each session, my hips are somehow re-stationed well. After a year of treatment till now, my deadlift sessions (started at 4 reps 22,5kg of 1RM: 30kg) end up with a PR at 90% of my 1RM (8 reps of 102,5kg 1RM: 142,5kg).  I have tried to loosen those trigger points in the problem area with a- foamroll, 8kg medicine ball, lacrosse ball, golf ball, large marble and etc... but somehow no matter how hard try, doesn't work as well as dry needling. Sometimes the muscles don't even budge even after 20 minutes of focussed pressure. Of course I make sure to react to pain when necessary and stop the attempt when it is uncomfortable.  P.S.: I always do my release attempt symmetrical, so whenever I attempt to release, I try it on both sides to prevent future imbalances.  Any ideas how to cope with this?  I tried Don Tigny's SIJ exercises and as refered in this question, and also PNF stretch for a while and it helped me maintain the status quo.  I want to give a try to Pavel Tsatsouline's beyond stretching, but I wanna prepare for it first and don't want to go further while I am having this annoying challenge. "
2619,Whats the real impact on running while training due to weather?,"I've been looking into the impact of heat, humidity, and solar radiation on running times, but most data is on actual race results. See this example of research. For calculations see this example.    Are the calculations biased by data from actual races since effort levels are generally higher during a race? How much so? Some research on the central governor theory, or other effort related exercise research which I can't remember the source for, actually got professional athletes to perform equally under a higher heat index.  What I want this theory for is to track training, predict performance, and compare fitness level under different weather conditions.I find the actual calculations to be a little conservative and would like to improve them with a simple rule of thumb.

2620,Dietary Preparing for Morning Training,Assume you want to go to the gym 0700 am.  Should you drink proteins the evening before the morning?  I have tried to take something very short carbohydrates before training like break with sugar and some milk. Eating too much makes the training inefficient.  How can you prepare for the morning training during the evening before? 
2621,Quads growth with spartan bows home workout,"I found a video called Spartan Bows. On this video they train quads which is the part of the leg that I want to gain muscle.   Is it possible to grow the quads by doing this exercise?   I play once in a week football for two hours, does this affect bad the growth of the muscle?  Also, i walk a lot in the day. Do that and football will make my muscles soft?  Should i stop the workout i do or not? How much time should i train per day? "
2622,Weight-lifting suitable for musician?,"I'm a professional pianist (female in my twenties) trying to get started with weight lifting, but I'm worried about the effect it might have on my hands in the long term. I'm mainly interested in building strength, not size, because I'm so weak from never having done any sport before that it interferes with my playing (I get tired much easier than I should, especially my shoulders). But when I started this week in a gym, where even lifting the bar without additional weight is a challenge for me, I noticed that my fingers get kind of ""stiff"" and lose a bit of dexterity if I try to play again after coming back from the gym. I tried to find information online about whether it's possible or not for a pianist to do weight lifting, or if I will end up ruining my hands, but I couldn't find anything consistent.   Does any of you know from experience? For those who lift a lot of weight, have your hands lost dexterity, and have your fingers become thicker with time?  "
2623,Flat feet running,"I'm a beginning runner and have only done a 5K, but I probably run about 3-4 times per week.  I'm have pretty seriously flat feet and wear orthopedics in my shoes that were fitted by a foot doc.  I started wearing them after a lengthy backpacking trip that resulted in my not being able to walk.  We had to cut the trip short due to knee pain.  It turns out the doc said something to the effect of my tendons were not tracking properly over my knees and I developed tendinitis in both knees.  Also, I could rarely stand barefoot for any length of time without heel pain.  All this said, I've read here about the Five Fingers shoes and the benefits of running barefoot, or nearly barefoot.  Is this something that I should attempt?  Some have said that despite flat feet they saw huge improvement in foot strength which led to less feet problems.  I read another that said running in FF's with flat feet caused some terrible ankle pain.  How can I determine what is right for me prior to investing in new shoes?  Also, I'm not even sure what it means to run with the ""proper"" form since I find it strange that we're now supposed to be running on the balls of our feet?  As a kid I was always told that was bad form.  Interesting.  I only know that I can currently run without any pain but the idea of strengthening appeals to me since that would mean less reliance on the shoe inserts. Thanks much! "
2624,Pan foods and muscle gain,"I have heard as an example that if you eat at night Pan Potatoes increase the body fat. Can this help me add some kg if I eat every night?( its unhealthy way?) What about eggs and bread on Pans?I like workout the morning I don't eat everyday eggs(I think I will have issues even I am 24) so if I eat eggs with bread that have been mixed on Pan could I destroy Protein and cardio?With other word this meal isn't helping me to increase the muscle size? Generally Pans foods aren't good for muscle growth,doesn't affect our body to get big or those foods are unhealthy but  help grow our muscle ?Should be avoiding or should it be in our food source? "
2625,Feeling bad after a long run,"Last week I ran 20km and finished running at 1 am, went back home and slept without eating a lot. I spent the next three or four days feeling tired all the day, feeling like if my body was heavier. Yesterday I ran again 24 km, planned it a little bit earlier and came back home at 10 pm. I ate as much as I could (rice, fruits, vegetables) to compensate for the 2200 kcal I burned. Today I still felt the same, headaches and heavy body. Am I missing something important when it comes to food? Or should I have drunk some electrolyte drinks? What could cause this feeling of fatigue or is it just normal after long runs?  I am 86Kg, 1m87, I do my long runs at around 6min30sec per Km, starting with a heart rate of 150 which drifts until 170 near the end. Maximum heart rate around 200 I think.  PS: I am 26 years old, no back or knee problems, training for a marathon trying to follow this plan but my knees were like ""NOPE"" this is not going to work. I had to reduce the training days to 3 or 4 days per week. I never ran a marathon before. "
2626,how accurate are the calorie counters on iPhone apps?,I use Kinetic to measure my regular excercise routine (walking). It calculates / estimates the amount of calories burned during that period.  I am wondering how accurate (generally speaking) these sort of calculations are? Are calories easy to calculate with tasks such as walking and I should trust it fairly well? Or are they usually bad enough that I should allow for about 50% allowance each way? 
2627,What to expect in terms of post-exercise fatigue and what to do about it,"2-4x/wk, I exercise from about 5:30--7pm (1 hr of weights + 4mi treadmill at 7:30-8:00 pace).  I'd say I work out from a 5 to 8 on a scale of 1-10, with 10 being highest intensity. I then shower, dine...and afterwards typically feel rather tired and low-energy until bedtime, such that I am fairly ineffective for much beyond just kind of taking it easy.  Sometimes this occurs a day or so after a workout.  I'd much prefer to have more energy, but also wish to have reasonable fitness.  The thing I've found that is most consistently correlated with retaining energy post-workout is my fitness level, unsurprisingly.  If I haven't been working out in months and try this, it is like a truck hit me.  If I am in good shape, it's not as severe.  I do try to do what I can in terms of eating, drinking, and sleeping properly.  My diet is largely vegetarian, fairly health conscious, and I drink sufficient water.  I could probably sleep better, and am working on that (that might be a big component).  My questions are:  Do I simply have to accept that I'll have this sort of energy drop, or is there a way to mitigate it significantly? If so, how?  How much should one's age matter?   "
2628,I feel recuperated immediately the next day after an intense workout. Okay to workout more?,"This question kind of seems like the ""am I working out too hard?"" question, but it's a bit different.  This question asks about whether or not one should trust their body or a timeframe.  I worked my forearms very hard yesterday, but today I did a lot of cardio and got a lot of blood pumping, plus high carb and protein loading -- and I feel completely replenished. I feel as though I should maybe workout again today. I used to go by timeframes before and never listened to my body because people always told me ""rest 3-5 days between every used muscle group."" I highly doubt I ever overtrain since I always see progress, however small, even if I workout two days in a row. I also use tons of supplements, so I never feel any muscle pain/fatigue/DOMS/etc. no matter how hard I go.  And I go REALLY hard -- no kidding. I can do over 50 sets in 30-45 minutes with little breaks at 50%.  I have never had any injuries and I rarely get DOMS -- usually only in the calves, but don't know why since I'm a 5 year runner and have pushed my calves beyond what most would dare to.  I, instead of feeling pain afterwards (like the next day), usually just feel tightness for a few hours right after highly intense workouts -- and within 48 hours I almost always feel like I go very hard again.  Maybe my body is recovering fast enough, and it's just really hard to overtrain? I don't want to lose any greater results I could theoretically obtain from training more. So should I just listen to my body?  I think it seems to make more sense to workout 1-2 days in a row, and then rest for a few days, also throwing in some light exercises in between. I have more concern under training than over anyways.  So what are some thoughts on this? Go the extra mile or don't be fooled by the green light? "
2629,108 Surya Namaskar - What are they counting,"I'm not sure if I should post here, or on Hinduism forum, as it is Yoga and Power workout.  I have been doing Surya Namaskar in the morning. I am comfortable at 30 rounds.   But according to tradition, they say reach to 108.  Just now, I read this article, [website]But I get confused with the following     You know your body best, know your limits and be prepared for a delay   of a couple of days before you reach your ultimate goal of 54 sets of   Sun salutations.   I understand that one set of Surya Namaskar is a set of identical exercises, working the left and right sides of the body.  So I guess someone can count one set of Surya Namaskar as two rounds, i.e.  1 set = 2 repititions of yoga  Help, I am really confused.  Do they mean make 54 sets, i.e. 108 repetitions, or 108 sets?  I am thinking they mean 54 sets (i.e. one set around the Sun), but now I'm not too sure.    Any of you doing this?  "
2630,My legs are more sore than they've ever been?,"So I was doing the leg press at my gym last Thursday with a relatively small amount(180) compared to my max(410) and after doing only 15 reps my legs(quads) got so sore. They still feel like they're burning right now and when I walk up and down stairs I can feel the burn. Not painful in joints or bones, but the muscles feel like they're ripping out of my skin. Sure, It's good they're growing, but this doesn't usually happen. I should note however that I have been off leg work for a considerable amount of time before this happened. I am still squatting and leg pressing every other day, also. Should I continue or rest? And is this normal? "
2631,Handling a single stagnating exercise?,"About 6 years ago, after having been a couch-potato for about a decade (following a knee injury) I've picked up strength training once more, and for the most part I'm already back at about 80% of my pre-injury strength stats:   Shoulder press:  120kg Bench press:     140kg Squat      :     260kg Dead lift  :     200kg Press-down :     100kg Leg-press  :     600kg Curls      :     60kg Leg extensions : 110kg Lat pull-down :  75kg   My current body weight is 108kg, so these stats for me are pretty satisfactory for the most part for a 43 year old guy I think. I'm not where I was prior to my knee injury, but I'm not a twenty something anymore so I'm quite happy with where I'm currently at, especially as my stats are still improving over time.  With this much regained strength, one would expect that doing a few pull ups wouldn't be any problem, right? Unfortunately for me they are. I can still not even do one clean (broad) pull-up. In fact, with the lat pull down I've been stuck at about 75kg for a few years now. Progress has completely halted on my lat-pull-down, and at 108kg body weight that's just to much of a gap to even try to do pull ups.   I would really like to be able to do pull-ups like I used to do in my twenties. My last attempt at changing my schedule ended in disaster. I moved shoulders from back/biceps day to chest/triceps day so I would have more room to focus on my upper back, but doing so ended me up with a shoulder injury that took me two months to recover from, so I had to move shoulders back to back/biceps day.   Are there any ways to somehow get myself out of this stagnated lat-pull-down situation and somehow work to doing clean broad bodyweight pull-ups, or should I just accept that I won't ever be able to do pull-ups again?

Is it possible to build and maintain strength for a beginner with little discomfort? "
2634,Is there a medical condition that prevents running laps but allows all other exercise?,"There is an 11 year old kid on the football team that I coach that has a slip from his doctor that states that he is unable to run laps.  He is permitted to do everything else, and can even run as many sprints as we want.  I am very uncomfortable with these instructions.  I can run the kid 6 x 100 yard sprints, but I can't have him run a 400 yard lap?  What happens to me when he drops on the 5th 100 yard sprint?  My philosophy as a coach has always been your are physically able to do 100% or you don't participate.  I understand that if a kid has a sprained wrist he can run but he can't do push-ups.  However, I want him released 100%.  I'm not going to have him reinjure something and me be held responsible.  The doctor needs to release him to do everything at practice.  Has anybody heard of such a medical condition? "
2635,Which carbohydrates should be consumed before starting an exercise?,I read an article about carbohydrates and was wondering which I should consume before starting an exercise.  Simple carbohydrates or the complex ones? And does it really matter or anything goes? Does it depend on which are fastest to get digested? 
2636,Improvements to a Size and Strength Meal Plan,"23 year old male, 84kg, 20% B.F. Currently training for size and strength.  I've linked my proposed training and rest day meal plans here.  All the weights I worked out myself and inputted everything into MyFitnessPal (MFP) to yield the pie charts at the bottom.  For lack of a better work I am a bit 'worried' about my macros; I think I'm straying a bit from the 50% carb, 25% fat and 25% protein ratio. Saying this, I'm not entirely sure how accurate MFP actually is/how truly representative it is - my diet consists of a lot of 'good' fats and the only sources of saturated fats I can pick out are from the milk and butter and I'm loading up on fruit and veg on both days.  So from a no-numbers standpoint, how does my diet look? I don't think I should be massively anal about the numbers because different sources quote different numbers so I have no idea which to take as gospel.  In terms of improvements, I've been advised to try and up my protein intake to 2g/kg of bodyweight and trim down on the carbs on rest days but I'm struggling a bit as to which foods I should add/replace - any recommendations? "
2637,Would wearing leg weights 24/7 be effective?,"If you were to wear leg weights, say a kilo or more on each leg, and never took them off for a month or so, would your feet get stronger, would that benefit you, or would it give you issues?  Would it be healthy? "
2638,What should I look for in a fitness exercise mat?,"I want to buy an exercise mat. I just did a quick check on Amazon and it was like I expected, you get mats in all different price ranges.  What are possible differences between cheap and expensive mats? What should I look for, when I intend to buy a high quality mat? Are there possible pitfalls or features that sound useful but no one really needs? Are there fitness mats for different exercises (some are called yoga or pilates mat)? How long and wide should a mat be, considering my height and the types of exercise?   "
2639,Workout buddy deadlifts 1200?,"So recently my old workout buddy moved due to work and I have a new one now, mid 20s in good shape and strength. The only problem, which is a big one, is that I suspect him of lying. He has been boasting to the other people at the gym and to me that he can pull off a 1200 pound deadlift. I should also state he claims he can lift 700 in standing military press. However, he refuses to show any of us his extraordinary lifts like these he talks about(not saying he doesn't deadlift or military press just not that much) claiming he doesn't want attention. However, my theory is he is lying and just is trying to get attention by looking overly strong. Is what he's saying possible? Is it wrong to suspect my friend like this? "
2640,How to get stronger (mostly upper body)?,"I'm a college runner with a 14 month injury that doesn't look like it's going away anytime soon.  So I decided I may as well take up weight-training instead.  I absolutely hate lifting weights, but, uh, apparently girls don't find 135 lb runners with a 15:20 5k attractive.  Who knew.  I want to come up with a weight workout routine, but honestly I have no idea where to begin.  My only goal is to get a ""normal"" or slightly above normal amount of strength as quickly as possible, so I don't look like a stick (my arms are thinner than most girls).  I know that for running, twice a day and 100 miles a week gets you good pretty quickly, but I've heard some people say that's its not good to lift weights every day.  Is this true?  And do I want to do low reps, high weight, or high reps, low weight, or somewhere in between?  I don't even know what sorts of things to do.  Machines or free weights?  How long of a workout -- 30 minutes, an hour and half?  Thanks! "
2641,Any advice on a 24 hour cyclical ketogenic diet,"I am a 43 year old man. I am 190cm tall and 85kg. I am slim with some belly fat. I am active, I do regular exercise and martial arts. My goal is to improve my general energy levels and sense of well being. I am also hoping to loose visceral fat and increase subcutaneous fat, and increase testosterone and growth hormone.  I have recently tried intermittent fasting, by delaying breakfast by 2 hours every day. I have a 16 hour period in the night and morning when I don't eat. I have also cut down on carbs a bit.  I feel very good and have more energy in general. Although I feel light headed and I little shaky in the mornings before breakfast.  I am interested to know if there maybe any benefits to cutting carbs even more, to the point where I would go into ketosis or semi-ketosis every morning before breakfast. I would then carb-up a little during the day, but by just the right amount so that I would go back into ketosis the next morning.  Is this a know diet strategy?   If so what might be the advantages or disadvantages of this approach over a constant keto diet or over a non-keto low carb diet?  "
2642,Can only squat extremely narrow,"I'm having a lot of trouble working on my (high-bar) squat. The only way I'm able to squat to proper depth right now is with a hip wide stance, with toes pointed out very far (45 degree or even more). When I try to squat with a wider stance, I feel pain inside my hip. I'm not able to squat to parallel with a shoulder width stance.  I have already performed stretches for my hip flexors and hamstrings, but this doesn't feel like it's helping with the problem.  I tried to do this kneeling frog squat stretch and this also hurts, when spreading the legs more than hip wide.     Is this stretch a good way to improve my hip mobility? Are there any other good stretches that I can try? "
2643,Post-Running Foot Pain,"I've been running high-school cross-country for about a month now, and I'm just starting to have pain on the side of my left foot. When I put pressure on my left mid-foot, then there is a sharp pain on the left side of my left foot.  Could it be a reptitive stress fracture? Or just a muscle strain? "
2644,How to incorporate Nuad Thai massages into the training schedule?,"I am currently visiting the gym 3 times a week for about 1,5 hours to work on my upper body. My goal is to gain muscles and add a little bit of definition. On the weekends I go to the ice ring for about 2 hours of freestyle ice skating to get my cardio done.  For relaxation, removing muscle tensions and especially to get more flexible I am planning to incorporate Nuad Thai massages at least twice a month into my schedule. This type of massage focuses on stretching the muscles and seems to be a valuable addition to my normal stretching routine. Now I am wondering if it makes a difference when I do this.  It is definitely less painful when my muscles are not sore, but it also might help with regeneration of those muscles. Would it be a good idea to go to the massage on a day where I visit the gym or the ice ring or should it be on an off day? If it is during a training day, is it better to go before or after the training?  Any other input concerning Nuad Thai and the benefits or maybe even drawbacks for fitness training and stretching is also appreciated. "
2645,Trainer told me to do 5 sets of 5 deadlifts. Should I be worried?,"Everything I've read says to do 1 set of 5 deadlifts or you risk injury. Is this true?  He is suggesting that I start at 115 lbs and move up to 175 by my 5th set, which is near my max. Would this be ok to do since I'm starting at such a low weight? "

2650,Isn't it true that all types of spikes will fit on all types of running spike shoes?,"Initially, I'd thought that all types of spikes will fit on all types of spike shoes, but after reading this article     If you are buying track shoes with spikes, check the size of the   spikes. Spikes that are too long will stick in the rubberized surface   of the track more than smaller spikes, which can slow down your time.   If the spikes are longer than what you need, ask the store clerk if   the shoes come with a smaller spike size. (Source)   I'm now confused about that matter.   I'm sure that there are different types of spikes (for short-d / mid-d / long-d), and I'm also sure that there are different types of spikes (for short-d / mid-d / long-d),  so basically I was wondering does all types of spikes (short-d / mid-d / long-d) fit on all types of running spike shoes (short-d / mid-d / long-d)? If I have a spike shoe, I can be sure that any individual spikes that I will buy will be able to fit in that shoe right?  ==PS: I'm talking about metal spikes here. "
2651,Is this a plausible cutting/bulking proposal?,"Considering that losing fat without some muscle mass loss is highly unlikely and gaining muscle mass without gaining any fat quantity is also unlikely, all we have to do is trying to optimize our routine and diet, that is, building muscles but gaining the least amount of fat possible in a bulking phase (a.k.a. ""clean bulk""), and losing fat but losing the least amount of lean mass possible.  Under these assumptions, I designed a strategy for myself, where I set a diary goal for my weight, observing a medium-term goal in a significant range and measuring my weight in the same conditions, almost every morning. I'm a ectomorph thin (1m93), keeping a 5 days/week exercise routine (basically anaerobic), a good quality of sleep and a diet designed for cutting or bulking phase with an amount of calories as reference.  The ""trick"" - and the quid of this question - is if my weight is below my diary goal, I eat more carbs (small GI) and if my weight is above my diary goal then carbs will be avoided in all meals but breakfast, pre-workout and post-workout.  Now, let's imagine a [almost-?]diary PDCA cycle, where:   Plan = the goal of the day and a previously defined and adequated exercise routine, diet, sleeping, hydration, etc; Do = your exercise routine, diet, sleeping, hydration, etc; Check = your every-morning measure, compared to the goal of the day. Are you really doing what's is your plan? Is your plan really good?; Act = Correct one or more points of your plan;   If the red line (real weight) is too above the blue line (goal), possibly it means an extra fat gain; if the red line is too below, possibly it means too much muscle loss. Both cases, we must act. Sure, ""too below"" and ""too above"" still sound subjective.  You can see the diary goals and results at this graph below:    The point is: I guess it is working, but I'd like to understand if there is any risk for my goals or even for my health. Could this goal system be an efficient approach? "
2652,Can less exercise give better results?,"I'm a rather skinny guy (1m88 for 74 kg). My goal is to gain muscle mass, with a focus on my upper body. I work out 2 times a week (sometimes 3). I also do 1 hour of badminton each week (but usually no cardio when I work out). I've been doing this for approximately 6 months now.   I'm giving more details below but in short my question is this: I was advised by a trainer at my gym to work out less than I currently do. Is this sensible advice ?  My current workout  I have followed internet advice (including from here), and my intuition in order to create my workout, which usually takes from 1 hour to 1:45 depending on my motivation. I usually do    ~ 8 exercises, 4 sets per exercise 10 repetitions  45 seconds break between sets.   This has given me results I'm happy with so far. I have only gained about 3 kg in 6 months. But my musculature is clearly more defined and my muscles are bigger. I have no idea if I could've had much better results than this.  Advice I got from a trainer  Today as part of my gym membership I had a trainer create a workout program with me. I basically just told her what I have written in my first paragraph above (focus on gaining volume in the upper body). She proposed a workout based on    10 exercises, only 1 set per exercise Aim for 6 to 9 repetitions in each exercise Doing the exercises slowly (4 seconds extension, 2 seconds pause, 4 seconds contraction)  This is slower than I usually do, and probably the most useful part of what she told me  She didn't suggest taking breaks between exercises   Doing this takes me only about 45 minutes. I thought this was not a lot, and asked her if she suggested doing the routine twice when I felt like it, and she said it wasn't necessary. To compare roughly, her proposed routine is around 100 reps in total, whereas mine is about 3 times more (although easier ones).   So to summarize: my gut feeling is that what she proposed will not give me better results than what I'm currently doing, as it's just so much less effort. Is there a good reason to do less ? Or should I go ahead and keep doing what I was doing before (or maybe double up on what she proposed) ?  Edit: answer from the trainer  After asking here, I went back to the gym and did the suggested new routine. As I was dissatisfied at the end (feeling like I had it in me to do more) I went and asked another trainer what he thought of this. I'm adding his answer here too.  Basically he said that the single serie I had to do in each exercise had to be so hard that I wouldn't be able to do even one more rep for the rest of the whole session. This means that if I still have energy like I do, I'm not pushing myself hard enough on that single serie.   He also said the goal with this program was to improve form and ""learn"" to use my muscles properly. Something that is easier to learn by doing 10 reps well than 40 bad reps.  Also one thing that I hadn't been explained properly is that this program is only for the first 6 to 8 weeks, and that it would change afterwards.  "
2653,Can aerobics make you grow taller?,"I am 15 and will turn 16 in two months. I am 5'2"" and I'm much shorter than all of the relatives. However everyone on my paternal side is about my height or shorter. My mum is 5'4"" and my Dad is 5'7"". I have started doing aerobics for 1 hour every day. I'm not sure what kind of aerobics its called, but it involve a lot of stretching of the arms and calves and things like that. Do you think I can expect to reasonably gain some height and maybe lose some wight as well. Do I still have time to grow and if so, how much? How do I know if my bones are still ""grow-able""? I'll probably do aerobics for a year or so. "
2654,"Son walks with feet turned out but bounces on his toes, he runs very slow, but wants to play sports without pain? Any corrective tips?","My son is 13, 5'10"", wears a size 14.5 shoes and has a very tall father and sisters.  He hasn't hit his growth spurt yet and I am concerned about his gait and his desire to play sports, but his struggle with it.  He walks and stands with his feet turned out.  He also mainly walks on the front or ball of his feet, kind of bouncy-like.  His heels don't touch or if they do not much.  He can shoot the ball and do those types of things, but running for any period of time ends up being painful.  He wants to play but struggles to run and if so very slowly.  He is very frustrated and we did have him see a pediatrist, but they gave us inserts and told us not to worry about it.  His ankles and calves are very thick, the bones are large, although he is not an over weight kid.  Average for his size, I would say.  But I worry about his future with his legs.  His dad is 7 foot and he has tall sisters.  But his running almost looks painful to watch.  He can shoot and do all of the other things, just struggles to get down the floor.  Are there any things we can do to help him correct this? Exercises?  Any thoughts would help greatly.  Thanks. "
2655,Should I run before weight training or after weight training?,My main goal is to lose fat. I have been struggling a bit to lose it. I want someone’s honest opinion about the topic: Should I run before weight training or after weight training? I read some article but they didn’t satisfy me with their answer. I usually run before weight training  because after a workout I feel tired. Any advice? 
2656,New running shoes chafing toes,"I'm just getting into running, and got my first proper pair of running shoes last night.  I got to try them out today.  They felt great for the first 20 minutes or so, but then I noticed they were chafing my big toes.  (On top, right at the first knuckle.)  Is this something that can be corrected by something simple, like, say, tightening my laces?  Or is this a sign my shoes don't quite fit?  (If it's the latter, the place I got them from has a very generous return policy.) "
2657,Should I do additional cardio?,"If I ride my bike to the gym, which is a mile from my house, and back home, should I do cardio at my gym? I am also lifting weights 4 times a week alternating between chest, delts, triceps and then back, biceps, legs, and I run for 15 minutes after my 30-90 minute weight training. My goal is to gain muscle and become more fit at the same time. I am 6'2, 26 years old, 175 lbs, and 7% body fat percentage. I am bulking and eating enough, I think; should I run or is my commute enough? "
2658,Leg Exercise Volume being way higher compared to Upper Body?,"When setting up a suitable workout routine, I often stumble upon routines that feature two or more exercises per training day for Quads and Hamstrings (e.g. Squats and Bulgarian Split Squats or Romanian Deadlifts and Leg Curls, respectively). Compared to upper body work that seems like a lot more volume.  Simplified, a push day out of such a workout routine (that makes me wonder and therefore ask this question) might look like this:   Back Squat Bulgarian Split Squat Calf Raise Bench Press Overhead Press Lateral Raise Biceps Curl   As far as I see, this would result in a lot higher volume for the Legs (in this case Quads) than for Chest or Shoulders. This sort of routine would be placed in a Push Pull workout for people with about 1 year of training experience.  So what is the reasoning behind that? Is it because the Quads are bigger muscles then Chest or Shoulders? Will one training with the mentioned above routine  see greater muscle growth than one only training Squats on Push Day 1 and then Bulgarian Split Squat on Day 2 for example?  To clarify, the overall goal is muscle gain and therefore hyperthrophy in the most efficient way, yet in a recoverable manner. "
2659,"Should I ""deal"" with my blisters?","Fellow runners,  I am starting to enter the business end of my marathon training. My long runs are around 20-22 miles and they are starting to take their toll on my feet.  I have a particularly angry looking blister on my little toe that is causing me quite a lot of distress - annoying really as this is the first serious blister I've had since I started my training.  I'm concerned that this may interrupt my training schedule (it really does look quite evil).  Is this something I should deal with or let it go down naturally? If I should deal with it - what is the best way?  Thanks! "
2660,straps and exercising with callus,"Yesterday, I forgot my straps and got an opened callus on my hand during wide grip pull-ups. Some guy in the gym gave me an elastic band and I continued exercising, though weights were a bit less (mainly because of not having straps, on lat pull-down, bent over row etc). Earlier when I wasn't going to gym I didn't use straps for pull-ups and didn't have problems with calluses. Later on when I stated attending gym I found straps useful as they allowed me to use more weight. So, I guess constant use of straps softened the skin on my palms. What is a good practice with straps? Should I sometimes do sets without straps with lesser weight? Also how to treat open calluses and exercise with them? Is wrapping it up with elastic band good enough? "
2661,How does exhaustion impact calorie expenditure?,"While answering this question, I researched some formulas for energy expenditure when running. None of the formulas I found took into account the factor of exhaustion when calculating calories burned.  To explain what I mean: If you start running, you feel fresh, you know your running technique and you have the fine-motor-skills to use it.  And so you run for an hour, you get exhausted, your legs ache and feel heavy. With this exhaustion your fine-motor-skills decrease. Your technique is inferior compared to when you started.  As far as I can tell, that should have an impact on calorie expenditure, as inefficient technique should burn more calories. Why is this not adressed in most (if any) formulas on energy expenditure? Is the effect just this small? Is it too complicated? Maybe it is indirectly considered when using heart rate as a factor?  EDIT: I feel I might have narrowed the focus of this question by using a running example. I'm interested in the general impact of exhaustion on calories burned in all sports, including running, weight lifting, climbing etc. "
2662,"Does foam rolling and ""smashing and flossing"" work?","I am the lucky (?) owner of a copy of the book ""Becoming a Supple Leopard"" by Kelly Starrett. In this book on page 139 he introduces a concept that he calls sliding surfaces:  ""To ensure suppleness, your tissues - skin, nerves, muscles and tendons - should all slide and glide over each other"".  Further he states: ""When you sit for prolonged periods, for example, your glute muscles stick to one another and become unresponsive, which limits their ability to contract.""  It sounds somewhat plausible that lack of movement causes these socalled sliding surfaces to not glide so great, but that the muscles starts sticking to each other sound preposterous to me.  Anyway, I would think that the cure for not so great sliding surfaces would be movement, the same way that movement ""lubricates"" the joints.     But no, the solution is according to Starrett to apply pressure to the muscles using different kind of foam rolls and lacrosse balls etc. He refers to using the lacrosse ball this way as ""smashing and flossing"".  Even though I am highly skeptical to his explanations, I think these techniques may work to some extent, but not for the reasons he suggest.  I think they could work in two ways:    Before exercise. The pressure somehow ""numb"" the neural system causing the muscles to relax leading to increased range of motion (ROM).    After exercise. Improves circulation leading to faster recovery like massage.   Do you have any experience using any of these techniques, and did they work?        I am especially interested in my point 1 above. The idea would be to increase ROM before strengthening the muscle in elonged state by eccentric training (""stretching""). Thereby causing a more permanent increased ROM.    "
2663,advices needed for building more muscle while decreasing body fat percentage,"Here is some of my background.  I have been constantly going to the gym like 3 times a week for about a year. I work on chest and triceps, back and biceps, and shoulders and legs on Monday, Wednesday and Friday respectively, though I don't really work on triceps and biceps that much, I'm also working on abs on Wednesday and Friday recently.  I have seen noticeable results for the past few months. But the problem is I don't see any progress now and it's kind of a bottleneck for me. My weight is around 145lbs the whole time, it doesn't change much. I'm 5'9'' tall and I'm Asian if ethnicity matters. I was very thin before and I have built some muscle and people could tell that, I have some definition now and I would consider myself toned. I also noticed that my body fat percentage is kind of high, although I never tested it. I can see that I have some belly fat around my waist and that's why I started to work on my abs. I don't have a restricted diet since I always think that I'm too thin. I follow the some routine and work out exercises every week. In addition I swim twice a week, 1000 meters freestyle every time.   I would like to know what I should do to gain more muscle and make more progress and at the same time decrease my body fat percentage. My work out routine? My diet? My cardio? Thanks. "
2664,What are the outcomes of training unevenly on various body muscles?,"While most of the trainers train all of their body muscles, it is possible to skip a few muscles and focus on the rest. The best example is all of the guys who don't care about the legs and  can end up looking like chickens. What I'm looking for is more example for this unevenness.   How would a guy that only does chest-press but never chest-fly look like?  How would a guy that only does back exercises but not shoulders look like?  How would a guy that only does triceps exercises but not biceps look like?  Is there anywhere photos of such cases?  Although I'm curious about the subject in general, specifically I'm a bit more interested in the first example (chest-press without chest-flies) because that's my current workout due to itching shoulders.  "
2665,Are these Workout Routines right for Body Building,"The weightlifting-101 blog post on the stackexchange blog and posts on fitness.SE has helped me learn more about strength training and body building. My goal is body building (to bulk up) in short term to get a proper structure (size &amp; shape) and then move onto strength training.  Here is my current workout routine (in order, 3 sets each of 12-10-08 reps with increasing weights (same weights in some cases)):  Mon - Bi's &amp; Tri's &amp; Forearms  Preacher Curl Dumbbell Alternate Biceps Curl  Lying Triceps Extension Barbell Close Grip Bench Press Barbell Reverse Curl  Close Grip Push Up  Dumbbell Triceps Extension Weighted Bench Dip  Cable Push Down(with V-bar) Cable Push Down(with rope attachment)   Tues - Legs &amp; Cardio  Seated Leg Press Lever Leg Extension Leg Extension(Reverse lie down, couldn't find a name) Two more machine related ones( couldn't find a name)   Wed - Shoulders  Seated Dumbbell Press Side Lateral Rise Front two Dumbbell Press Machine Shoulder Press  Lever Lateral Rise Upright Barbell Row Shrug   Thu - Cardio  Running &amp; Cycling   Fri - Back &amp; Chest  Barbell Bench Press Decline Barbell Bench Press Push Ups  Lever Alternating Narrow Grip Seated Row Machine pull down seated(couldn't find a name)  Cable Standing Fly  Cable Wide Grip Seated Row Lever Underhand Seated Row  Assisted Pull Up  Lever Chest Press Lever Seated Fly   I have been training for 2 years now and have increased my weight few months back from 63-70kg and mostly due to following the above workout schedule for the past year. My goal is to increase my weight to around 70-85kg and get into proper shape.   Is this workout schedule right for my goals? Does this cover opposing muscles as explained in the blog post? Does this cover large before small muscle group exercises as explained in the blog post?   I plan onto get Practical Programming on Strength training, Life without bread and Chemicals for life &amp; living to enhance my knowledge further in this field. If someone can help in the meantime with my questions, I would appreciate your inputs. "
2666,Are respiratory training adds dangerous?,"Some time ago, I got myself an ""elevation training mask"", a device that basically limits airflow (with holes) and adds resistance with valves.  Sometimes, when I train with it, some friends point out to me, that I should be careful with it and that it's possibly dangerous for my brain, because of the lack of oxygen.  I'm wondering, because it doesn't simulate the altitude (less oxygen in the air), but just adds resistance, is it dangerous to use it?  I know that the oxygen percentage in the air stays about the same and only the air pressure decreases, but that shouldn't matter with this question.  Are these devices dangerous? What can happen and how can I prevent it? "
2667,Push/Pull/Squat vs Brosplit,"I am 26 years old, been working out for about three years now.  I have not been sticking to my program for about 6 months, only lifting 1-2 times a week (working college student).  My schedule has opened up, and I should be able to stick to a program for at least a few months, what kind of program will produce the most gains?  I have tried a split before (Mon:Chest, Tue:Legs, ...) but had almost no result, probably because I found it so boring.  I made decent progress with SL 5x5, but am open to trying a split again.  So should I take my new strength back to curls and leg extensions, or would it make more sense to continue a full-body routine?  My goals are to get bigger and stronger, just to be clear. "
2668,Effect on Calories required when working out,"This is not specific to myself but it's something I'm interested in. So if you download one of the fitness apps and it says enter your details etc... and for example it says to lose weight you need to consume 1800 calories.   Is this 1800 calories including working out, or 1800 calories after subtracting the ones you've burnt?  Surely after working out loads and being over active in a day you will need to consume more. Is this why programs such a slimming world who don't actively incorporate calories into their plans are so successful?  Also are there any repercussions of eating significantly under 1800 for example 1200kcals as well as doing exercise (other than feeling physically tired)?  "
2669,Why lower back pain during Straight Leg Raises,"As discussed in another question, some people have lower back pain during straight leg raises.  Why?  Many places on the internet will tell you that these people have weak abdominal muscles, and they can't control the tilt  of their pelvis. That is probably true.  However, there must be more.  I would guess that there is a disk bulge which, together with weak abdominals, is creating the pain.  On the other hand, the pain happens when the lumbar spine is extended, and that is not when a posterior disk bulge would be pushing into the spinal cord. Can anyone help me figure this out? "
2670,Is it bad that my feet turn outward when I run?,"I recently started going to a personal trainer and he noticed that my feet turn out to the sides when I run. He said that I should try to correct this, but I'm not sure how to do it. Is it bad that I run this way? If so, are there exercises or running drills I can do to try to keep my feet straight? I've tried to be aware of it when running but forcing my feet to stay straight just feels uncomfortable.   It's only a slight turn, but definitely noticeable. I've been running for several years so I imagine that it will be hard to change my form, but figured I'd ask.  "
2671,How to love push-ups?,Which benefits has push-ups? I do push-ups many times but my muscles doesn't grow and I lost my motivation for this exercise. Could anyone tell me what is the gold side of push-ups? 
2672,Does 12 10 minute cardio sessions equal one 120 minute session?,"If I jump rope and achieve a heart rate of 150 bpm for 10 minutes and I do this 12 times a day is that going to burn an equal number of calories and strengthen my cardio system as much as jumping rope with a heart rate of 150 bpm for 120 minutes?  Also, how long would it take me to do 12 10 minute sessions? i.e. how long does it take for my body to warm up to 150 bpm? "
2673,Vertical Leap Improvement Plan?,"I am having some doubts for quite some years !  Used to play basketball for some years and i was always a guy who could jump quite well(over 38 inch), i am 6 feet tall and dunking was an easy task.   We all know when we are prone to something like :    some guys have the shooting ability some guys have the speed and agility some guys have the court awareness etc...    What is my point ? Well - When training to be a better basketball player you need to work on all part of your game ? right !  So which exercise for all can stop you from improving you vertical leap even thou they are basketball drills that might help you ?     I know this doubts of mine can seem kind strange but from my experience i can say the yes there are exercises that will stop you from jumping better. Example :  Doing 5 mile runs.  Running with wights.  Doing plyos when you shouldn't.  And so on...  Basically What drills interfere with vertical training ?  I just what to know if others fell the same way and if so share the experience. "
2674,10-15% high intensity training - what is the % of,"I have read in a number of places (magazines and some online) that when training for things like a 10K run, half marathon or cycling event doing HIIT training can help but you should not do too much of it as it takes a lot out of you.  For example 10-15% of your training should be HIIT while the rest should not get your heart constantly above 70/75% of max.  My question is what is the 10-15% of:  1) Number of times worked out in a week? 2) Time worked out that week? 3) Distance achieved that week?  For times that would suggest I only do HIIT training once ever other week, which doesn't seem like a lot  Time or distance seem more like it but not sure which is more appropriate. "
2675,Is it necessary to alternate the mixed grip for deadlifts?,"When I deadlift, I'm using left hand over, right hand under. Are there any differences if I switch the hands? Are there any benefits to switching or cons to not switching? "
2676,Recurring muscle pull in Upper-back/Neck when doing overhead press/bench press - form advice,"When I was doing a 5x5 based workout a year or so ago, I had issues when trying to push the weight on the overhead press. Even though the weight felt comfortable in the sense that I could do at least 5 reps with a minimum of a few sets, twice on separate occasions I pulled a muscle in my upper-back/neck which prevented me from working out again for 2-3 days before it healed.  I switched to doing seated press and haven't had an issue with it until recently. While doing a higher yet still comfortable weight on bench-press, I pulled the same muscle and am baffled as to how it could happen doing such an exercise.  My question is, what am I doing wrong on both exercises that could be putting so much strain in an area that isn't a main muscle for the workout (especially in the bp case)? And what could I change in my form to help prevent this?  Form description  I had a spotter on both instances, during ohp they didn't mention anything about my form being wrong, and I followed the head movement described for most ohp forms when lifting the weight up.  For bp, I arch my back and assume typical bp form.  Injury description:  Prevents me from turning my head left or right to the normal maximum degree without straining/pain in the pulled muscle area.  Below I've circled where I feel the most strain from the pull.   "
2677,Can cycling with single leg improve endurance and increase slow twitch muscles with shorter workouts?,"Can cycling with single leg improve endurance and increase slow twitch muscles with shorter workouts?  Theory  When muscle groups fatigue, they start to recruit larger motor units. That may explain why when you're exhausted, the workouts feel harder, and why polio victims fatigue sooner.  With single leg cycling, one leg VO2 max is close to that of two legs. That means the larger motor units can be targeted sooner given the same oxygen consumption. More of our muscle fibres would be given the signal to increase capillary density, increase mitochondria, increase mitochondrial enzymes, increase antioxidant defenses, and other kinds of adaptations.  My understanding  Based on my understanding, if we cycle 1 hour with one leg, the exercised leg may think it exercised up to 2 hours in terms of recruitment pattern! Having a meal in between two rides may refuel the smaller motor units, preventing some of the larger motor units from being trained.  Possible benefits  If this works, we may be able to break fitness plateaus or maintain endurance with more flexibility in our schedules. According to some commentators, long rides should be done all in one go so biking to work, working 8 hours, and riding home feels different for our bodies than riding twice the distance to work then staying overnight at work.  If you're doing group rides, it can help the slower riders keep up with you while you have a good workout.  It may also decrease blood pressure because a study showed that higher type I fibres reduce blood pressure. [website]Another benefit is that the exercised leg could push harder than in two-legged workouts at a lower heart rate without causing breathlessness. Those with health problems such as hypertrophic cardiomyopathy or high blood pressure may need to limit their heart rate during exercise to stay safe.   Challenges  What we may need to do is make sure that we don't pull on the upstroke. We might use the counterweight on the pedal of the unused side or redesign the chainrings to make the upstroke easier. We also need to remember to exercise the other leg on another workout.  Does this actually work in practice? "
2678,How much harder is it to burn calories in hot weather?,"I make walks to try to keep a little fit and to burn calories/fat. At a temperature of about 16°C I can walk 10K in just above 2 hrs with almost no rest and not being excessively tired afterwards.   I often spend time in tropical countries. At a temperature of 25° and moderate humidity, my performance is severely limited. I would guess that I walk about 3K in 2 hrs and I get really tired. (I try to supplement fluid and electrolytes, of course.)  The actual temperature may also be higher than 25°, I think. I get the temperature readings from the Internet, and I think they usually indicate temperature in the shadow. However, taking walks you are most often in the sun.  I am a Western guy about 175 cm/83 kg.  My question is divided in two:   How many calories are expended in the two situations respectively?  (Brisk 10K walk at 16°C or slow 3K with several  breaks at 25°C, being much more tired after the latter.  Both take about 2 hrs.) (The first would be about 600-700 kcal, but how much is the latter?)   I refer to EXTRA calories expended by the walking. I have not included the basal metabolism in the figure 600-700 kcal. One may also have to consider change in basal metabolism due to f.ex extra work like sweating needed for heat dissipation.   If the calorie consumption is much lower in the ""hot"" alternative, how should you then make your aerobic exercise in the tropics? Is the only alternative to buy a membership with an air conditioned gym and do treadmill etc?   The only thing I found on the Internet is that you burn more carbs (cp to fat) during exercise in hot climate. That may speak against exercising in hot climate, but my guess is that it is just a marginal factor in my situation.   My aim is to burn about 600 kcal extra. I do that in the ""temperate"" alternative with a 2 hr walk, but how do I do that in the tropical climate?  (OK. I know one answer is ""Get up in the morning, you lazy guy."" But early or late exercise is just not possible right now for me.)  Edit 1  [website]This article mentions thermoregulatory vasodilation in skin as a main mechanism for getting tired more quickly in a hot climate. Cardiac output (f.ex monitored by heart rate) must be used to both muscle and skin. If this was the only mechanism limiting your capacity, I guess one would assume that cardiac exercise could be OK in hot climate but calory burning not necessarily the same  when blood is shunted through skin for thermoregulatory purposes.  Edit 2  A useful, non-invasive method to investigate calory burn is indirect calorimetry  (IC). (Measure O2 and CO2 in expired air to calculate calory burn pretty exactly.)  I haven't found any studies yet that do IC (and work load) in a hot environment and compare to a temperate environment. One may make the assumption that ""blood is simply shunted through the skin to cool off"" but to be sure you need experimental data. (Some cooling mechanisms may consume calories,  f.ex.)  For example. If you feel ""completely wasted"" just walking slowly in a hot environment, would your pulse rate then be at the same level as it would be in a temperate environment, for the same level of pronounced ""tiredness""? I am not sure the limiting factor is cardiac output, at least not for me. Last time making a walk in hot climate, feeling very weak in the legs, pulse was only around 108 and no real shortness of breath.   Many individual aspects also come into the picture. A short (having the same proportions) or a skinny person will dissipate heat more efficiently. A person with black skin is better protected from UV-rays, but may absorb more heat, under some conditions at least.  Edit 3  This year the L.A. Marathon was run in 31°C heat. Daniel Limo won on 2:10:35. His personal best is only slightly better than that: 2:08:39. As a Kenyan marathon runner he is probably extremely well adapted to heat  (genetically and through training).  This good performance in hot weather is interesting. His body can not have wasted a lot of cardiac output by shunting blood through the skin for cooling. I wonder how he performs in cold weather? He maybe has to wear extra clothes when racing at lower temperature?? "
2679,Sexual arousal to speed up recovery?,"Is it a viable post-workout method to make one's self sexually aroused for prolonged periods of time?  Studies show that sexual arousal increases test. in both males and females and etc. I assume this has to stay above baseline if the subject constantly forces themselves to remain sexually aroused for a longer duration. I could do an intense workout, and supplement with porn (or even imagination alone!) for 3-4 hours straight and not include masturbation so that the urge cannot be lessened.  In such, this is forcing one's self to become as horny as possible to increase hormones. I believe this has to be a viable method since more test will speed up recovery. So would it be a smart move to make myself become sexually aroused for multiple hours, straight and steadily (no pun)?  Of course this isn't replacing sleep and a good diet, but how much can this help recovery?  I highly doubt that many people try this solely for muscle recovery aid -- maybe ""edging"" though.  Any feedback on my discovery? No, this is not just ""abstaining"" because it's not about avoiding sex/masturbation, but solely about making yourself as aroused as physically/mentally possible for prolonged periods of time. This question is not ""too similar"" to any questions already asked here. "
2680,Does someone sell latex-free jump stretch/exercise looped bands?,"I have searched extensively for all sorts of different name combinations for latex-free jump stretch/exercise bands. I see that there are Theraband-style light bands that are latex-free, but all of the more heavy-duty bands for stretching seem to be rubber latex. Is there some better name for these bands I should be using to search for them? Does someone sell latex-free ones?  Here is an example of a latex one:   [website]"
2681,Pushups: Low quality vs high quality? (sloppy vs controlled),"To keep up with some basic exercise, I've been regularly doing a fixed number of pushups (increasing a little over time).  The quality of my form is admittedly quite sloppy, I'd not say they are ""cheating"" (where you only move the top half of your body, or even just bob your head up and down, I'm sure you know the sort!). But they aren't slow and controlled either - I'm not lifting my body 100% to straight arms - and moving it all the way down either (maybe ~75% of the motion at a guess).  While the same number of fully controlled pushups is obviously harder then less controlled movement, is there a strong argument to favor controlled exercise assuming you're equally as tired after both?  Or is this simply different exercise? As 'crunches' are different to full 'sit-ups'.    I'm asking this because for me it's motivating to set a number and reach it every time, If I'm tired I have worse form, if I'm feeling energetic I have better form. But at least it keeps the exercise regular and it gives me some goal to reach. However I'm wondering if poor form could be harmful in some way, or if there are significant reasons to force myself to do less reps with better form. "
2682,Hip mechanics in kipping pull-up,"I'm trying to master a kipping pull-up as a means of getting my kipping muscle up. I've probably watched 20 online tutorials, most of them from CrossFitters, since they're the ones who post the most videos online. I'm having difficulty discerning what exactly the hips are doing and where the power is generated.   Swing I understand. Hollow position at the back of the swing, arched at the front of the swing.   Then: From the arched position, close hips powerfully as you swing back. Some videos ([website]So does the power come from the closing of the hips or re-opening the hips? Which part of the movement is the priming, and which part should I make as explosive as possible? Are these two different techniques that are both fall under ""kipping pull-ups""? Or is there really a hip opening happening after the closing that's concealed in the videos that don't talk about it?  (Please don't answer that everything should be as explosive as possible - Imagine how jerky and chaotic it would be if your were transitioning from arch to hollow to arch as explosively as possible. You'd be flopping around like a fish instead of actually swinging.) "
2683,Do I lose all the benefits of earlier strength traning when I stop doing it for a while?,"I have been doing strength training regularly for a few years and I can clearly see the benefits now. However, I am wondering what if I stop? If I completely stop strength training for one year, or five years, or ten years, will my earlier experience of strength training still benefit me in any sense? In other words, after stopping exercising for quite a while, is there any significant difference between my body and one who has never done any strength training? "
2684,Wearing orthotics in lifting shoes,"I am planning to start taking Olympic lifting classes. Since I want to take it seriously, I wanted to makes sure I am geared properly. Currently, I am using orthotics due to the leg length discrepancy (longer left leg) and flat feet which is combined with hyper-mobile feet.  Because of the collapsing of my arches on my feet, my feet have naturally gotten wider than average and it is sometimes a pain to find proper shoes also. I would love to do all my power lifts bare-feet but experience shows me that it is best to do it with orthotic intervention. So I need some sort of vessel to house the correction insoles and make sure there is no intra-foot movement, because I once tried dead-lift only with the soles, and that turned into a fiasco due to lack of traction... even Steve Wonder saw that coming!  The gear I currently use are: - Chuck taylors for powerlifting excersizes - Asic Gel Nimbus 15 for running - Adidas Supernova Glide for running, walking with anti-pronation support for walking - Adidas Samba classics from the 90's with a tough rubber sole for when I need a change of gear.  I have a couple of questions regarding this. I hope you folks can help me.   Which brands do you use? (I was thinking of Adidas Adipower or Adidas power perfect 2) What type of materials should I ask my podiatrist to use in case new insoles need to be cast What else can I do or use to make sure that learning Olympic lifts will be more fun than rather concentrating on corrections and deficits all the time?    Thanks a big bunch! "
2685,Working out 7 days a week,"Is it reasonable to work-out 7 days a week doing strength-training, provided the muscle groups are cycled each day with sufficient rest between each training, or will this be detrimental long-term?  Additionally, would working a sedentary desk-job affect this (e.g. can this be considered 'adequate rest' through the week)?   If it makes any difference, my motivation is for both weight-loss and for muscle-gain.    Background:  I typically go to the gym for an hour, with a routine of 30 minutes strength-training, and 30 minutes cardio. The strength-training always targets different muscle groups each day (e.g. chest, back, core, legs, arms, etc) -- and I normally try to cycle it such that the same muscles won't be reused back-to-back to allow as much rest in between as possible. The workouts are normally mid-to-high level intensity.  Most recently, I've been making an effort to do this daily as opposed to my old routine of going 5 days a week -- but I want to ensure that this won't have negative consequences to myself in the long-term.   So far, I have not experienced anything negative yet. In particular:   I am still seeing improvements in my overall weight-lifting I am still losing weight consistently (to be expected, since I will continually be burning calories) I am not in any pain when I do this (since I target alternate groups)   However, there have not been noticeable differences in muscle-mass according to my Fitbit Aria 2 scale (whose accuracy I don't entirely trust). Additionally, I have found many articles saying to rest at least one day a week -- however these articles never seem to address the cycling-muscle-group approach.  One additional motivator for this question is that I work a desk-job which keeps me pretty stationary for ~8 hours a day during the week, and so I'm unsure if this could reasonably be considered a form of rest throughout the day (contrast this to someone who might be doing a high-intensity job that involves carrying heavy objects).  Any insight into this would be appreciated "
2686,Ultramarathons: would 'racewalking' be faster?,"For races which are long enough that the average speed falls below the maximum speed achievable via a 'walking' style of movement, is it more energy efficient to 'walk' at that speed as opposed to running at that speed?   If not, are there any references available as to why a running style is preferred? Many sites state that running consumes more calories than walking the same distance, which would suggest that it is, in that sense, less efficient. "
2687,Will I lose gains in this situation?,"I workout a lot and eat enough for my body to build muscle, I'm seeing gains.   I don't workout for 2 days a week, and I eat less on these days, will my body lose muscle on these days?  Example; If I am ill and I can't workout for 2 weeks and don't eat as much as I normally do, will I lose my muscle gains? When I start working out after these two weeks, will me body recreate the gains I had before getting sick, or will it take the same amount of time again to rebuild them? "
2688,Question about Newbie Gains,"So I read about something called 'Newbie Gains', which is essentially how new people starting a workout routine will see themselves gaining a lot of muscle mass in the initial first few weeks of training. A good example is my friend who spends all his days on the computer, very unfit and skinny, however upon starting a 5x5 training routine and sticking to it, found himself dead lifting 60kg very easily after about 4-5 weeks (though after that he stayed in the 60-70kg weight range for a good few months).  So my question being, since I have no access to a gym (but do have dumbbells at home), will I end up sacrificing any gains by doing low weight exercises such as dumbbell dead lifts with only about 12kg weights max on each hand? I imagine 12kg is going to become extremely easy to dead lift very fast, so could the unavailability of higher weights end up making me miss out on my 'newbie gains'? If it helps at all, my intention with all this is to gain muscle mass. "
2689,What is wrong with CrossFit?,"Background Information  When I started exercising a few months ago, I started with P90X and Insanity (Insanity for the mornings and P90X for the evenings). As a result, I'm getting used to high intensity exercises.   During researches on exercises to perform, I came across the CrossFit program and it seemed to be a huge trend. Checking the exercises, I saw that a lot of the exercises have already been implemented in the videos that I used.   I also noticed that a lot of articles on CrossFit declared it to be a horrible exercise program. These articles were written by either former CrossFitters or non-CrossFitters. Many of the complaints were    Monthly fee is exorbitant.  It's a cult.  The exercises are performed wrong.  It can result in a disease called Rhabdomyolysis.   All the arguments I've read against the program revolve around those 4. Also, many of these articles are on fitness/exercise websites. So, I can't assume that these authors simply hated exercising.    On the flip side, many articles were read defending the program. These articles were written by current CrossFitters.  I haven't been able to find an article that provides the pros and cons of the program in such a rational, clear-headed way.    Questions  I don't plan to join CrossFit (or any conventional gym); however, I like a lot of the exercises and plan to incorporate them into my workout routine.   As a result, I need to know the following:    Does anyone know of any articles that highlight the pros and cons of the program? I would like an article that's not hate-based or fan-based.  What exactly is wrong with the program? The exercises? The intensity? The Rhabdomyolysis issue? The performers' forms? I have a problem with the cost (all the articles indicated members pay upwards of USD150 monthly).  Given that all exercises have inherent risks and everyone has their preferences, what makes this program receive more vitriol than programs such as Insanity/P90X?   The goal of the question isn't to create tensions based on opinions; rather, it's for me to obtain enough information and experience to determine if it's worth my time. I believe it is, but maybe those more experienced than I am see issues that newcomers can't easily see. "
2690,When does plank during stop working for aesthetic purposes?,"I understand that for any given exercise, the rep range for power is 1-3, strength is around 5, hypertrophy is around 8, and 12+ is for endurance. How does this related to planks?  E.g. how long should I be able to hold a plank position before adding weights? 30 seconds? 1 minute? 2 minutes? "
2691,training for 200m freestyle swim race,"I have 6 months to train for a swimming race (200m freestyle in a 50m outdoor pool). My level at the moment is beginner/intermediate, with fairly good technique. Should I focus on training longer distances, or sets of shorter distances, or a combination of the two? Or maybe even swim just sets of 200m at full speed? What would be a good workout schedule for my goal? My current time is around 3:30 and I need to lower it by about a minute. "
2692,Why keep your knee towards the outside in dorsiflexion exercises?,I see this Half Kneeling Dorsiflexion Mobilization exercise a lot as a method for improving ankle dorsiflexion. Here is Start:  Ending position:  Why is it that it is recommended to have your knee outside your ankle instead of over it? Does this also apply to lunges in general? 
2693,Are 15 reps too many for increasing muscular endurance?,"I'm going to gym and i want to improve muscular endurance . My trainer (actually he's not a professional trainer, and i'm not trusting him) told me you have to do high reps with low weights .   For example, i'm doing Bench Press 3 set 15 reps . Because of 15 reps, i working with low weights. For example, i can do 10 reps with 35 KGS , but i can't do 15 reps with 35 KGS . So, i'm working with 20 KGS (yes, there are big difference) so i can do 15 reps.  I'm not sure 15 reps is good, or too much. I read a few articles about increasing endurance, all of them saying ""8-10 reps"", or i misunderstood them. What do you think about my training system ? I'm working with this, for a few weeks. But i want to see my muscles' improvement, i mean my biceps are still small (for example) . I want grow them.  In shortly, I'm doing 15 reps with low weights (but i'm always trying to increase weight). I want to increase muscular endurance and gain more muscle. Should i decrease reps number and increase weight? "
2694,Due to the office timings (1 to 10 PM) doing workout late in the morning 10:00 AM has any impact on fitness?,Due to the office timings (1 to 10 PM) i do workout/yoga late in the morning around 10:00 AM and also go to bed late in the night around 1or 2 AM. So does this time slot has any impact on the physical fitness or make workout less effective? If there is an impact on the mentioned things then what can be the ideal/best time to performing these activitis to get best out of it? 
2695,How can I keep my feet cool and dry?,"I'm a bicycle commuter in Toronto, Canada. My feet sweat more than most. In the spring, summer, and fall, I wear closed-toe sandals. But in the winter, I don't, and my feet become overheated and uncomfortable.  I did some research today. Now:   I'm considering putting underarm antiperspirant on my feet at bedtime. Both on the soles and between the toes: there are lots of sweat glands in both places. I hear that thin wool socks also help[1][2][3] and hope to buy some.   What else should I do to keep my feet cool and dry?   Do my sneakers matter much? If so, what's best? Perforated leather? Mesh-and-synthetic-leather? Canvas? And how do you know? (Notes: I'm not concerned about water resistance or athletic performance. Also, I'm on a budget and am probably going to buy generic-brand shoes.) Is there anything else that makes much difference?  "
2696,Breakfast on Morning of Race,"I'll be doing a triathlon next Sunday with the beginning of the race at 8:00 am. I'm going there as an amateur, but I've always been a competitive guy so I'll do my best to perform well.  I've been training over the past two weeks and feel fit but haven't considered the importance of the nutrition aspect at all. Furthermore, due to work schedules I haven't been able to train at the same time as the race will be.  Especially, I'm concerned with the breakfast of the morning race. My plan is to wake up at 5 am and have breakfast immediately after with:   hot tea 2 slices of toasted bread and jam small cup of fruit salad   I have a series of questions:   Waking 3 hours before the race is enough to digest what kind of breakfast? Will my suggestion be too little or too much?  What is the caloric intake of the indicated breakfast and what are the best options for a race day? Should I add remove something?  "
2697,Should I concentrate on leg lengthiness exercises first or leg thickening exercises first?,Should I concentrate on leg lengthiness exercises first or leg thickening exercises first?   I am a guy age 30. Height : 5 feet 6 inches (1.67m). I have short and thin legs as compared to my upper body.   I want to add at least 1-2 inches to my lower body and make it muscular as well.  I am confused what to do first? 
2698,Sleeplessness after exercise,"Sometimes after intense exercise, I will become very sleepy and require a nap. Sometimes, exercise doesn't affect my sleep at all. And sometimes, I won't be able to sleep at night.  I have a very regular sleeping pattern - in bed by 10:30-11 pm, and up at 8. I usually fall asleep within ten minutes. But on certain high intensity days, I find this doesn't happen. An hour of intense work starting at 3:30 in the afternoon could keep me awake for half the night.  Does anyone know why this happens? And especially, does anyone know a way to mitigate this problem? Some sort of cooldown routine that will keep my sleep regular?  "
2699,How can I improve my ability to do speedwork?,"I've been running for a few years now, but I still struggle with speedwork. I use an online training plan generator that takes previous race time and distance, target race distance, weekly distance, and schedule duration to generate a running plan that includes easy runs, tempo runs, speedwork, and rest or cross-training days.  My training plan is based on a four week cycle. Monday is an easy run, Tuesday is an easy run on weeks 1-3 and rest/XT on week 4, Wednesday is speedwork on week 1 and 3 or tempo run on week 2 or an easy run on week 4, Thursday is an easy run, Friday is rest or cross train, Saturday is long run, and Sunday is rest or cross train. The plan also builds speed throughout, across all the workouts. Distance also increases. Total weekly distances range from 22 miles/week to 35 miles/week. The plan deviates slightly at the end, close to the race.  When I'm on a treadmill, I tend to adjust the plan paces based on something like this conversion chart to account for the fact it's slightly easier to run on a treadmill than outside.  I rarely take a rest day, opting for strength training and/or some time on an elliptical (usually strength + 15 minutes elliptical but sometimes 30 minutes elliptical or 30 minutes arc trainer). I do tend to take the rest days as rest days early on in the plan (which is usually following a race), very late in the plan (the week or two before a race), or if I'm not feeling well for any reason to avoid pushing myself too hard.  To give an idea of where I stand, my 5k PR is 29:00, my 10k PR is 1:09:51, my 15k PR is 1:57:21, and my half PR is 2:35:07. Unfortunately, last year, I was coming off an injury. I was healed before the spring, but my winter training was almost nonexistent so my times were far worse. Last years times were 32:55 for 5k (April 2016), 1:17:35 for 10k (June 2016), and 2:53:03 for a half (November 2016).  Based on my training, I'm edging close to a 5k PR this coming April. My easy runs on a treadmill are recently around 10:50-11:10/mile. I could probably even push that up a little and be comfortable. I've only had the weather for one good outdoor run, and it was an easy run around 11:30/mile. My tempo runs are around 3-4 miles long and I'm running at around 9:40/mile.  Even though my easy and tempo runs distances and times are projecting a near PR, my speedwork runs are terrible. Today, I was scheduled for a speedwork run that consisted of a warm up, and 5 0.5 mile intervals at 8:20/mile, each followed by a 0.25 mile recovery interval (I used a pace of about 11:30/mile), and a cooldown for a total distance of 6 miles. By the middle of the third speed interval, I was physically worn down.  Am I doing something wrong in my speedwork if I'm able to complete my easy and tempo runs on plan (and sometimes better than plan), yet struggle with my planned speedwork?  What can I do to specifically improve my speedwork without huge deviations from my plan which is tailored to my upcoming 5k race? Are there any modifications I can make on training days that call for speedwork? "
2700,arms (biceps & triceps) are never sore the next day following workout,"I do a full body workout (legs, chest, back, biceps, triceps, abs).  The next day I always feel a bit sore in general.  However, nowhere whenever I train have I felt sore in my biceps or triceps.  For the workout, I do the following:   Straightleg deadlift Barbell Benchpress Cable Lat Pull Down Tricep Cable push down Barbell Curls (biceps) Crunches   That is my basic routine.  I do 3 sets of 8 reps of each exercise.  In the case of bicep/triceps, I can never barely go past my 8th rep of the 3rd set, so I think I'm using enough weights.    Also, I've never seen good increase in arm size.  I somehow link this to the fact that I never feel sore, so I am not training enough.  Does this make sense?  Should I do somethinig different?  Is there anything 'bad' in my routine, or which can be improved? "
2701,Do accurate strapless heart rate monitors exist?,"I'm a runner. I've been using a Garmin with GPS to track my runs, which I enjoy. I have issues with the chest strap, though. (Not just Garmin's.) I find chest straps to be very uncomfortable to wear; they get stuck under the band of my bra and chafe, or they twist, or they slip. It doesn't matter how well-adjusted it is, I just don't like them.  I've tried the FitBit and a few other gadgets, but they estimate calorie burn based on weight and age.  Is there such a thing as an accurate heart rate monitor that doesn't use a chest strap? I know there are some watches that have sensors that sit against your wrist pulse. Are these anywhere close to accurate?   Note that I'm not looking for continuous monitoring; I only want an HRM to use during exercise. "
2702,"Does exercising late at night kill your ""afterburn""","I've read about this so called ""afterburn"" effect resulting from high intensity workouts. For up to the next 24 hours, your body is supposed to burn more calories than it normally would. I always exercise around 10pm-midnight, so I go to sleep within an hour of my workout. Does this mean that I lose the afterburn effect, or does it continue into the next day?   In addition to this, is it true that there are benefits to working out in the morning as opposed to the evening? "
2703,What is the correct Push Up technique for Serratus Anterior Engagement?,"In this video trainer Nick Tumminello recommends:     Hands closer together, slightly elevated and slightly internally   rotated.   But in the comments, a ""Sylvester Koh"" (no idea who he is, but his comments sound informed and so I wanted to confirm or deny) agrees with a ""Kirstine Vest Have"" who says:     Funny. A study using EMG says the hands should be externally rotated   for max activation of the serratus ant.. Not internally rotated.   (Perhaps this study, though it's for an unstable surface.)  Sylvester Koh also says:     If you [have] clinical reason in terms of muscle biomechanics and physiology,   internal rotation will result in the recruitment of the pectoral   muscles ( internal rotators) which defeat the purpose of this   exercise. Push up plus serves to isolate serratus anterior muscle   activation only and removes as much recruitment of pectorals as   possible. Besides performing external rotation, at the shoulders,   isometric shoulder horizontal abduction would further deactivate the   pectoral muscle via reciprocal inhibition.      In summary, in order to perform the perfect push up plus exercise,   there should be thoracic kyphosis, lower cervical flexion, lumbar   flexion with posterior pelvic tilt, shoulder external rotation, and   isometric shoulder horizontal abduction, in order to fully activate   the serratus anterior muscles.   And     Place your palms on the floor in a standard push up position such that   your palms are directly under your shoulders. Try to contract your   posterior deltoids such that your wanna bring your hands away from one   another. Next flex your neck gently and focus on protracting your   scapular as much as position. I would recommend that your keep your   scapular protracted for as long as you can rather that continuously   move through the range of motion like in this video. Make sure that   your abdominal muscles and buttock muscles are contracted fully   throughout the exercise such that your lower back is flat out.   So my questions are who is right, and what is the best form? Thanks! "
2704,I want to get ripped. Can bodyweight exercises do the job?,Can I get ripped without going to the gym ? I know it sounds lazy but I live in an area where there is no gyms at all. And going to the gym even twice a week can be really tedious for me. So .. Can bodyweight exercises do the job for me ? 
2705,is it necessary to do exercise that target only one muscle a day,"I live in India and have joined 4-5 gyms in last 4-5 years in different cities. Every time people do and also suggest me to do exercise that target only one muscle per day. e.g. on Monday only biceps exercise, on another day only triceps exercise and shoulder exercise on any other day, i.e. to do exercise that target only one muscle each day.  I exercise in the gym daily for 1 hour in the morning and 30 minutes at night after dinner and before going to bed (most time of the day I just sit on a chair as I'm an IT developer). I want to build or grow muscles mostly on bicep, triceps, shoulder, chest, wings (not abs, back, and leg).   So is it really necessary to do exercise targeting one muscle a day like I mentioned above, and if it is necessary, do I have to do exercise targeting only one muscle at morning and night on the same day, or can I target one muscle at morning and another at night? How much time of rest should one maintain between two different kinds of muscle exercise? Or is this all just a myth? Also if I do biceps and triceps together then will the benefit of exercise gets reduced?    "

2708,"Fatigue after a certain amount of reps, no matter what the weight is!","I have noticed that I fatigue and develop a swollen or ""tight"" feeling in my muscles from doing too many reps. The amount of reps defined as ""too many"" is any over about 5.  I notice that even if I'm just squatting without any weight (using only my bodyweight) I get the same effect ... tightness, swollen feeling, fatigue, and usually DOMS if I continue sets like this.  What I want to know is: why is this? I mean I tend to almost always stay in the 1-5 rep range, but that's for strength building. I don't have a serious regimen, but that shouldn't explain why any amount of reps causes this sensation.  Say I squat 135 lbs. for 3 ... sure, it takes decent work, but if I were to do 3 reps without the weight, I'd still get that swollen, tired sensation.  Are my muscles just lazy (is that possible)? Am I unconditioned for reps so bad that any endurance is off-tracking for my nervous system?  I don't care for many reps, but I am just wondering why I get this aftermath from simply trying a few more reps here and there with varying weights.    PS: Yes, even after stretching of any kind it's the same problem. I try to get several days between workouts, but that ""tired, aching"" sensation lasts for days or even weeks. "
2709,How much protein per muscle mass?,"Earlier topics such as Protein: How much is too much? acknowledge body mass but not muscle mass. I want to steer attention from recommendations in terms of body mass to muscle mass.  I cannot understand figures such as 1.5-2grams protein per each kilogram in your body. Suppose twin bodybuilders/crossfiters A and B with the same physical profile except differences in the amount of muscles and fat. Suppose a guy A with 90kg weight and 30kg muscle mass. Suppose a guy B with 70kg weight and 35kg muscle mass. I cannot understand why A should take more protein (i.e. 90*2=180grams) than B (i.e. 70*2=140grams)    (source of the image)  where B being a guy with 7-8% fat body percentage requires far less protein than the guy A with 20-30% fat body percentage. My pre-assumption was that more muscle requires far more maintenance so B should take more protein than A in order to maximise muscle growth and keep the metabolism with a lot of muscles running.   I am very skeptical with statements that suggest to take protein according to body mass. I find that muscle mass is far more important to protein synthesis than the mass containing muscle mass, fat mass, liquids and bones. So        How much protein per muscle mass?    Why is protein usually suggested in terms of body mass and not in terms of muscle mass? (there are tools today to find the body profile with muscle mass and fat mass precisely enough)     "

2711,"How to grip the dumbbell in french press, so I apply even force in both hands?","I want to do french press exercise, I want to use 1 dumbbell.   Note: It doesn't matter to this question if the exercise is done lying , or sitting, it's the same issue for both.  I'm interested in the following problem: When gripping the dumbbell my hands are necessarily in a asymmetrical position, there is no way to grip symmetrically as far as I know (you can provide me counterexamples). So the problem is, the force done by each arm and hand could be really different, how to minimize this difference? Grip very strong with my hands? Alternate hand task left and right every new series?  Another option is use a barbell in which then I can position my hands symmetrically, and thus the problem is gone, or to use two dumbbells, one for each hand.  Note 2: This guy(this is a timestamp, you need to see 10 seconds of the video only) has a dumbbell with weights with large diameter, so he can position his hand in hand triangle, which seems a good grip, do you agree? "
2712,"Is it true that more calories give more energy, plain and simple?","I am asking this because I read a post jokingly titled, ""Why fat people will hurt you.""  It mentioned there that, because heavier or obese people tend to eat more, they tend to store more energy. With more energy stored they have ""reserved"" capabilities to unleash bigger bolts of strength, even without exercise.  I, myself, used to be quite obese, about 100 lbs. overweight. I never weight trained but felt random bolts of energy, and I ate anywhere from 2,500 to 5,000+ calories a day. I ate junk mostly, drank soda, etc. I basically never did any weight training or the related such.  I did notice peaks in energy and strength just from the excess of calories, and I slight urge to release the energy sometimes (run a little, climb up stuff, etc.).  Basically, is it true that heightened caloric intake stores more energy ... and this energy can be attributed to more strength in some heavier people (or anyone who just eats a lot), regardless of training?    If not, what can explain the ""caloric surplus controversy"" over eating more and having more strength/energy? "
2713,My current office chair makes back ache,"I know this is probably not a usual question you see on here but anyways. I have over the past year purchased three different office chairs. They have all seemed fine for the first few months, however after the 2-3 month mark my back starts to hurt. There's no specific part, sometimes it's the lower back sometimes the upper back but it keeps me from doing my work properly. I sit at my desk for 8-9 hours a day( I'm a student and software developer).  I'm not sure what to do. Doing back exercises doesn't seem to work either. I don't know whether it's because I'm 197cm tall (~ 6'7'') and most office chairs aren't suited for my height? If so, can you recommend any brand or even a specific chair? It's really a problem for me, it increases my stress levels a lot on top of the pain I have every day in my back.  Any help/suggestions appreciated "
2714,Full Body Exercises Split Due to Time,"I just purchased a  book called Jim Stoppani's Encyclopedia of Muscle and Strength. I have learned quite a bit from it. With that being said, I do have a question that I thought I would ask the nice group of folks you all are.  Jim says as a beginner to do one exercise per muscle group with 3 sets with about 2.5-3 min rests three times a week. So far so good. However, I like to work out during my lunch hour since I work from home and my gym is about a minute drive. I have family life and blah blah. However, mathematically, this takes over an hour.  Is there a problem with breaking up the full body exercises? Ideas in my head were something like half the exercises during my lunch and the rest of the muscle groups after work? As a beginner, is there a way to break up the full body exercises to a 5 day week to train all groups? I could incorporate weekends too but I was just following the suggestions in the book before I built my plan.  I would do all after work, but I like the feeling of working out during lunch to help me during my day. Before work isn't an option due to daycare and I'm the one that takes the kiddo to daycare. Any helpful suggestions would be SUPER! "
2715,General advice for continuing my weight training effectively,"I've been going to the gym 5 days per week rarely missing a day for the last 4 months now, with the aim to put on as much muscle mass as possible. Until about 3 weeks ago I have been able to increase the weight I have been able lift across all workouts except for squats, which I am still stuck on at a tiny 20kg. I have noticed reasonable gains mostly in my quads, chest, triceps and back.  I've noticed now that I haven't been able to increase my weights, and have on some days even had to reduce the weight I am lifting compared to a weight I could lift perfectly fine the previous session. For example, when I started I was able to do 3 sets of 10 reps of bicep curls using the cable machine at only 14kg and about 3-4 weeks ago was able to do the same volume on 24-26kg, which was exciting. The last 2-3 weeks however I have been struggling, even having to drop to 19-21kg for the last set. I have noticed the same problem across most of my muscle groups including legs, back and chest.  Understandably this is a little discouraging but I'm not sure if it's common to feel like I'm falling behind for a couple of weeks and then I'll jump back and start gaining again or if I am doing something wrong.    This is my current weekly routine below. For all workouts I do 3 sets of 10. Some workouts (marked with an asterisk) I increase my weight each set and often fail on the 8th or 9th rep of the last set. All workouts are listed in the order in which I complete them.  Sunday: Legs  - Squats - Leg Press* - Superset Leg Curl and Leg extension - Moderate intensity bike for 15 mins   Monday: Triceps &amp; Biceps  - Bicep curls with cable machine and straight bar* - Tricep pull down with cable machine and the rope* - ""21's"" (though I do ""15's"" i.e. 5 halves, 5 full and then 5 upper curls with the easy bar)* - Skull crushers with the easy bar on a flat bench* - Concentration curls* - Tricep overhead extensions*   Tuesday: Rest  Wednesday: Shoulders &amp; Biceps  - Shoulder press - Side shoulder raises - Forward shoulder raises - Upright rows* - Bicep curls with cable machine and straight bar* - ""21's"" (""15's"" same as Monday)* - Concentration curls   Thursday: Chest &amp; Triceps:  - Dumbbell bench press (flat) - Dumbbell bench press (incline) - Dumbbell bench press (decline) - Tricep pull down with cable machine and the rope* - Skull crushers with the easy bar on a flat bench* - Tricep overhead extensions* - Flys (flat) - Flys (incline) - Flys (decline)   Friday: Back &amp; Shoulders  - Lat pulldown - Cable rows (upper back) - Deadlifts* - Rows with the easy bar* - Shoulder press - Side shoulder raises (while lent over on a bench) - Rotator cuffs   Saturday: Rest    As I said this was working well for me up until now - I think I heard somewhere that as you move away from being a beginner in weight training you need to reduce the amount of times per week you spend on each muscle group and increase intensity. Maybe that's where I'm going wrong (looking at the above I'm doing quite a lot for each group except legs and back). Another thing I've thought I might be doing wrong is 3x10 for every workout. I'm guessing some of the bigger workouts like bench press I could come down to 8 reps and try to go a little heavier.  I've looked at routines like 5x5 Stronglifts but they seem to be more for absolute beginners looking to gain some initial strength before serious weight lifting for muscle gain.  Maybe it's just time to change my routine entirely, but then I'm not sure what constitutes 'change' - whether I can just swap the days around and add another set or whether I need new workouts entirely. Maybe I should even just try changing up the order I do things in, I'm not sure.  If there are any noticeably poor decisions I'm making then please let me know. Admittedly I didn't delve too deeply into articles or books about weight training and kind of just structured the above based on what I noticed was producing decent enough gains and what groups I could do next to each other without conflicts (i.e. I tried back day next to arms and my biceps were getting destroyed). I have a feeling there's too much happening but again I'm not even close to being an expert so I have no idea.  Should I try 4 sets of 8? Should I stop going as heavy as I possibly can and just sit on a weight I can comfortably finish all my reps without failing on? Maybe I should try supersetting on different groups like arms? Any advice that can push me over the line of being a beginner to an intermediate weight lifter is greatly appreciated. "
2716,Am I misunderstanding the recommended daily protein intake? I find it impossibly high,"I've read in multiple locations (including fitness se) that the recommended protein intake is a minimum of 0.8g/kg, and 2g/kg is a better target for fitness training.  To me this seems outrageously high. I feel there's no way I could feasibly consume that every day. This makes me think I must be misunderstanding the recommendation.  Here's my understanding of it: I weigh 92kg (BMI 23.5), and do regular cardio and weight training, so apparently I should aim for 184g of protein a day. That's:   About 37 eggs (6g protein each), or About 6 chicken breasts (30g protein each), or About 9 scoops of protein power (20g protein each)   I can't physically or financially manage to consume any of those (or combinations of), every day, indefinitely.  What am I missing or not understanding? Or do athletes really just consume that much stuff every day? "
2717,Instantly increasing flexibility by becoming angry as a result of pain,"When a person experiences severe pain his body enters some sort of ""survival mode"" and as a result his flexibility (and strength I seem to remember) is increased. This is demonstrated here by Charles Poliquin: [website]Sadly Poliquin did not explain the details of what is going on here. I have seen this explained by some german physiotherapist but can not find the video anymore.   I wonder if this is the same phenomenon as when powerlifters sniff ammonia before big lifts?  Is adrenaline involved? My theory is that fear and or anger releases adrenaline which causes increased strength and mobility by the nervous system ""taking the brakes off"".  I think this is related to Hysterical strength?  Can anyone explain this more thoroughly or point me to an explanation?   EDIT: I found the video I talked about again:  Improve Your Squat! Full Mobility Workshop  It is long (82 minutes) but show several demonstrations both illustrating the effect of ""fight or flight"" as well as how stiffness eg in the neck can reduce power output.  Still no scientific explanations though.      "
2718,Is it breathing through the nose good for running?,"What are the advantages/disadvantages of breathing with one's nose while running? Is it a good idea to develop this habit?  I'm referring to relatively slow, long runs, and for experienced runners. "
2719,"Core training on ""rest"" days","I started a gym routine 2 months ago consisting of just Pull-ups, Bench presses, Squats(with barbell), Dead-lifts and Military Presses And for the abs Hanging L raises, Russian twists and planks.  I really love the compound movements and core engagement.  I do it 3 times a week, Sunday Tuesday and Thursday.  I also occasionally (1-2 times a week) do a mini-core exercise at home consisting of planks, Russian twists, ab crunches and arch holds, external rotator cuff for the shoulders, starting with some Yoga movements.  My questions is, am I pushing too much? should a rest day be absolutely resting, or are the Abs/Lower Back/Yoga on ""Rest"" days is OK?  If its OK, is it also good to add exercises like the ab wheel and L-seat to the off days routine? I think this may be different as the strain on upper body is bigger with these exercises. "
2720,"Initial weight loss, followed by 2 weeks of inactivity","I am a 38 year old male, 5 ft 10in weighing 82 kg. I started going to the gym regularly about 5 months ago - 4 or 5 days a week, each day doing 1000kcal worth of cardio plus some weight training.  After approx 3 months I was down from 83kg to approx 77kg, however I then got ill and didn't go to the gym for two weeks. I was slightly horrified to see when I did go back that in those 2 weeks I had regained all the weight that I'd lost in the previous 3 months. I was back to nearly 83kg!  I have since been doing the same regimen for the past month and a half or so and my weight has hovered around 82-83kg. My diet has been pretty much the same both before and after I started going to the gym regularly, maybe improved a little since I started - I aim for around 2000-2500 kcal per day (though that usually falls down at the weekend).  Any idea how this could happen? And how to remedy? It's slightly depressing... "
2721,Am I expecting too much too soon?,"Background:  36 year old male, currently weighing 90 kgs, size 36 waist, I go to gym 5 days per week for 45 mins in the morning as it's the only time I can motivate myself to go due to how my work commute and energy levels work out in a day. I've been steadily increasing my gym frequency since the end of 2014 (2 times a week) until now (5 times).  My aim is general fitness, strength and building an appropriate upper body - I don't need to have a super hero physique, but defined arms and chest would be good.  My weekly routine is as follows:   Monday - Cardio (5km run, treadmill at 1% gradient) Tuesday - Strength (details below) Wednesday - Cardio (5km run, as above) Thursday - Cardio (5km run, as above) Friday - Strength (details below) Saturday - Rest Sunday - Rest   My Strength Workout is as follows (in this order):  NB: 1 rep = 2s extension, 2s retraction (I read this is the correct way to work with weights), all named exercises are using Life Fitness Optima Series machines of the equivalent name/exercise.   10 mins on Concept2 rowing machine at max tension (10) for warmup Chest press 49kg - 10 reps Triceps Extension 49kg - 10 reps Bicep curl 35kg - 10 reps Seated Row 49 kg - 10 reps Lat pulldown 49 kg - 10 reps Pectoral fly  42 kg - 10 reps Rear deltoid 42 kg - 10 reps Abdominal 49 kg - 10 reps Finish with 12-13 mins walking at 4% incline   My questions:   I recently moved from doing ""Strength"" once per week to twice per week (2 weeks ago) - when I was doing once per week I could easily do 49 kg across all machines. Am I doing something wrong or is my current inability to maintain that weight level due to needing further development or more rest? The gym instructor who did my gym orientation session said I should stay on circuit machines for a while until I feel ready to invest in a few personal training sessions with the gym weights trainer - considering that 49 kgs is almost the maximum weight on a few of these machines, how do you decide that moving to full-on weights training is appropriate? Is there a better and more strength related exercise that I could do instead of the 12-13 mins walking? By the time I reach this point, I am usually quite tired and would not be able to do another circuit at that weight level - is it worth doing the circuit again at a lower weight?  "
2722,"Sleep: Wake up at same time, or get more rest?","I've been hearing mixed advice on the topic of optimal sleep. Serge Faguet's article on biohacking suggests that waking up at the same time everyday, regardless of the time you sleep, is key to optimal rest.   On the flip side, Dr. Matthew Walker on Joe Rogan Podcast 99% of us need 7-9 hours, always.   My question is, after a late night out, am I doing more to help my body by waking up at the same time everyday, or to sleep in? "
2723,Should I push through and keep lifting if my knee and wrist are giving mild pain?,"I suffered a serious sprain four months ago. So serious that my hand felt like it was going to fall off for the next three months after lifting. Or, in the first month, even doing one push up, and the doctor says it is fully recovered now. I thought it was too until about 4 weeks after returning. It is giving very mild pain, nothing near to what it used to be. As for my knee, I hurt it a month ago and it is also only giving a little pain when squatting and it is supposed to be an injury from running that will take 2 months to heal the doctor says. If I extend it, it clicks but it's not supposed to be permanent damage. Should I lay off or keep working? It makes me upset knowing that months have been going by and I am not lifting because life is short and if I am 20 years old I probably only have about 60 years left. Help? "
2724,Exercise scientific understanding of this leg exercise program,"This is a follow up question to this one:  Substitute for squats and squat jumps that put less stress on knees  I have found this leg exercise program which tries to minimize knee strain  [website]One exercise is for example the half one legged squat half deadlift. But there seems to be a consensus that it is better to do full squats.   I feel that it is true that one has less knee stress if one does the The Single Leg ½ Squat, ½ Deadlift compared to a full squat. But it doesn't seem to work the entire legs just like full squats do, so one has to complement The Single Leg ½ Squat, ½ Deadlift which other exercises to get a balanced workout and avoid imbalances. Is my feeling correct? Why or why not? Is there any scientific evidence for it?  Here is a list of the exercises:     The Single Leg ½ Squat, ½ Deadlift   Anterior Lunges   Romanian Deadlifts   Monster Walks   Single Leg Bench Hip Bridge   Sled Pushes   Forward Sled Drag   Reverse Sled Drag     So I am not interested in opinions but what can one say from an exercise scientific point of view about that exercise program, the exercises it uses and about the composition. In particular with respect to avoid knee problems, avoid muscle imbalances and about its effectiveness to strengthening the legs.  Are there any important points I should have in mind when following this program?  For me all those exercises seem to be hamstring/glute dominant, it seems to neglect the quads. So even if those exercises are knee friendly, how can I put it together to get a balanced leg workout? The Reverse Sled Drag seems to be the only exercise which really targets the quads. However if I don't have access to a sledge, how can I put it together in this case? "
2725,What can I do to work on uneven shoulders / back?,"During a bench press, on the way down, my spotters tell me that my barbell is coming down a bit slanted, which I think means that I have uneven shoulders / back.  What can I do instead to correct this?  I am thinking switching over to dumbbell chest presses as well as shoulder presses -- and avoid the barbell altogether.  Should I see a chiropractor?  I rather not spend money if I don't have to. "
2726,When should I take my protein shakes?,  When should I take my protein shakes bearing in mind I only do crossfit twice a week? Should I also take it on rest days? 
2727,Are protein supplements used outside of bodybuilding?,"The phrase ""protein supplement"" suggests a substance that can be consumed to offset a protein deficiency.  Searching the net for ""protein deficiency"", however, I was unable to find any sources describing the use of supplements for this purpose.  In addition, searching for ""protein supplement"" yielded results consisting almost entirely of bodybuilding websites and fitness supplement stores.  Are protein supplements used outside of bodybuilding?  If so, what are examples of their use?  Edit: I mean to ask about formal medical uses such as correcting recognized protein deficiencies.  Edit 2: I am not restricting this question to over the counter, commercially available products such as shakes and powders; I mean to ask about supplements in the general sense. "
2728,the right excerise progragram for me?,"I'm 23 years old 1.68~1.7 meter and I have spent the past 16 years in a sedentary lifestyle. Most of my body isn't fat with the exception of my belly which is 107 centimeters. What is the best program to follow to lose this extra weight as fast as possible, and, in the same time I don't not gain a lot of muscles (I'm pleased with my current ""shape"")?  Also, is exercise to boost the speed and strength of my muscles? And, what nutrient plan should I follow?  *note: it would be better if the program doesn't include exercises dependent on machines or dimples, as there is no  GYM in my place of residence.   "
2729,How much carbohydrate intake can exercise offset on a ketogenic diet?,"The ketogenic diet advises keeping carb intake under 50 grams per day, and ideally under 20 grams.  Assuming that a person performs intense cardio exercise (e.g. crossfit), burning, say, 400 calories per session (day), does that offset an increase in carb intake?  In order words, if I'm sedentary and stay under 20 grams of carbs per day, I remain in ketosis. Carbs provide 4 calories per gram, so if I burn 400 calories via exercise, how many extra grams of carbs can I eat and still remain in ketosis? (100?) "
2730,Incorporating singlespeed cycling training into current freeweight routine.,"I've entered a 100 Mile Cycling Sportive (that takes place in July 4 months to train) I intend to ride it on a singlespeed (non fixed gear) road bike. (with a gear ratio of 43-16)  This will be the second century ride I've done, but the first real distance I've done on singlespeed. I love the challenge and the simplicity of singlespeed riding so please no answers advising using a geared road bike.   I currently train a progressive overload hypertrophy/strength 5 day split, and also go for a 30+ mile cycle on each Sunday.  A rough outline of my routine is below please note, not all excercises/warmups/warmdowns/stretches are listed.   Mon - Back (e.g. Pullups, Rows, Deadlifts) Tue - Chest (e.g. Bench, incline bench, weighted dips) Wed - Legs (e.g. Squats, Leg Press, farmers walk, lunges) Thurs - Arms (e.g. Curls, pushdowns, skullcrushers) Fri - Shoulders/Core/Auxiliary (military presses, planks, forearms &amp; calves) Sat - Rest  Sun - Cycle (30+ mile singlespeed ride with a few taxing climbs)   Currently I feel my cns can take quite a good beating and currently day to day I'm not fatigued and generally recover well.  My nutrition is generally good - Lots of protein lots of nutrient rich vegetables and lots of low gi carbs, and I also get plenty of sleep each night.  I also supplement the following:   5g creatine monohydrate in water per day 2x Omega3 fish oil gel caps and 1x multi vit per day A pre and post workout protein shake  and I have an espresso (no sugar) as a pre workout   I also fuel properly while cycling long distances (one water bottle &amp; one gel per hour on average depending on intensity/outside wind/temperature)   My question is this. How can I effectively incorporate cycling training into my current routine to enable me to comfortably complete the 100 mile sportive?  For instance: Should I increase frequency of cycling and reduce time in gym? should I increase time in gym but focus on including cardio? Should I keep gym the same but add additional cycling training? Should I alter my low rep high load strength focused training to hi rep low weight endurance based approach? Should I rest more/less? Will my work in the gym improve or hinder lactate threshold? Should my long ride be spaced further away from squat day to increase recovery time? etc etc.  Also any tips on climbing steep gradients on singlespeed are welcomed :)   Thanks for your time. "
2731,I have exactly one month and ten days to get in unbelievable shape,"This will be my first and probably only post on here. I have physical fitness tests for my police program in Quebec, Canada, in exactly 1 month and 10 days as the title says. Tests are:  -2,8km in less than 12 minutes (Got it easily) -Bench press one plate 15 reps (Not even close) -15 pull-ups (Could make it) -100m swimming in less than 2 minutes (Tips???)  The bench press is my clear issue here. I'm an ectomorph and can bench 15 reps of 25 pounds (no judgement please). Is it possible to add 20 pounds in one month? How to do so? "
2732,How to get rid off Squat Anxiety?,"My Gym has no Squat rack so I have to do the squats with lower weights. I'm following a classic PPL program and my 5 rep maxes are:  BP: 65kgx5 DL: 100kgx5 OHP: 45kgx5 Bent Over Row: 60kgx5 Squat: 75kgx5 :(   I'm going to try using Smith-machine for squat, do you think is it a good solution? Or should I start doing Leg-press instead? "
2733,"Buying an exercise bike, magnetic vs spin?","In the previous decade, I was a relatively strong cycler, doing an average of 120 to 150km a week. I've since moved and had a kid and just can't get the time in for long outdoor rides.  I've used stationary bikes at the gym for years, and I typically drift to the Exercycle-type systems with programs that adjust the difficulty automatically. Reading between the lines, it appears these are magnetically controlled for resistance. I have used spin-style bikes on occasion, and I can't recall them feeling much different to ride.  Now I'd like to buy a stationary bike for my home. I have a perfect spot in the downstairs play-room with a nice TV to pass the time. Now I have to decide which style to buy:  If I go the spin route, is the sound an issue? Does chain vs. belt make a difference?  Are magnetic bikes quieter? This might be an issue.  For home-style bikes, can the magnetic systems offer the sort of resistance the gym ones can?  For basic home exercise, is there any strong argument for one vs. the other? "
2734,Whole Body Mobility Routine,"I'm currently trying to assemble a little mobility routine for myself. I got two, a little more detailled, questions:   When should I perform mobility exercises:   Before the workout, in order to get the full range of motion? After the workout, in order to not tax the body to much before the workout (but with a light warmup before the workout of cause)? On a seperate day, and only lightly warming up before workouts?  What exercises would such a mobility routine consist of:   If the goal is to target increasing mobility in the whole body? Is it even practical/useful to target mobility in the whole body? Foamroller or Lacrosseballs would not be a problem, if needed. I already own these.    For workout routines the thinking is fairly easy to me. Hit every muscle in your routine and you're done (yes I know, pretty oversimplified, but essentially that's it). Whats the thinking for mobility routines? Hit every joint, maybe?    The Goal:  My overall mobility is pretty bad, so I want to improve it in order to prevent injuries while lifting weights and also increasing my range of motion in exercises like the squat. "
2735,Finger/Hand strength exercises for spin bowling in cricket?,"I am in the process of transitioning from being a medium pace summer cricket bowler to being a spin bowler in indoor cricket. In particular I'm playing around with some 'caroom ball' style variations. To bowl these well, and indeed any spin bowling style deliveries, a lot of finger and hand strength is needed.  Apart from simply practising bowling, are there any good specific exercises to improve this kind of strength? Ajantha Mendis who has lead the renaissance of this 'caroom ball' style bowling credits his hand strength to the training he received in the Sri Lankan army. What kind of exercises might this have involved?  Edit: For those not familiar with cricket or this style of bowling, the action requires some fingers to pull in (using grip strength) and other to flick out. It is actually the flicking part that needs the most strength, rather than conventional grip strength. "
2736,Push Ups vs Machines,"Why can't I do push ups (lol) but I can perfectly do 13 kilos 4series 30 reps, in a tricep or bicep workout? Plus it's a compound movement meaning I'm not enfoquing everything on just one muscle?  If you have recommendations on how to begin on push ups feel free to help me please. "
2737,Shoulder muscle problem,"I got my right shoulder tear while doing a Bicep Preacher exercise. I have been off from the gym since February. I have pain only during motion, but after two months, I think I have the same intensity of pain. Can anybody guide me on how long it takes for healing? I don't have any swelling or bleeding, but the pain is, I think, the same since from that first day.  I consulted with an orthopedist. He told me to leave off on the gym for two weeks, but it's been almost two months that I have not gone to the gym. Is there anything I can add to my diet to improve my healing? "
2738,Have I really put on 14 lbs after only 4 Crossfit sessions?,"I'm a skinny, unfit 24-year-old male weighing 143.3 pounds (65 kg). I started Crossfit two weeks ago (along with a healthy, fruit and protein-rich diet) on the basis of 2 workouts per week.  Today, I had my 4th workout (2nd week) and went to buy a scale. When I came home, I weighed myself naked before having anything to eat to see if I had put on any weight yet. Turns out I now weigh 157.8 pounds (71.6 kg). Is this normal? Is my scale wrong? Is this too much in too little time to be true? "
2739,Is muscle growth limited on teens,"I'm 15 years old and I have been working out for about 6 months. Over the first 3 months I've noticed some considerable changes in my muscles, but recently I haven't noticed many changes ( actually, muscles like my chest have been pretty inconsistent, and it's size has been varying).  Could it be my age that is limiting my gains? Or is it my routine or nutrition that are bad?  Routine: Monday- workout  Tuesday - swimming Wednesday - workout Thursday - swimming Friday- workout Saturday and Sunday- I play volleyball and rest  Nutrition - I eat considerably well, with 4 meals a day and protein shakes, but I don't measure exactly my macros.  Body info -  1,70m tall 65.5 kg  14% bf "
2740,Are anabolic steroids required to achieve certain strength and musculature?,"The question asks about whether or not anabolic steroids (test, tren, dianabol, inhibitors, insulin, HGH, etc.) are required to reach a specific level of strength or musculature. Some people, even medical experts, have told me that there are certain ""sizes"" that are only reachable with anabolics -- but some people (and there are plenty) claim they're natural and that these levels of musculature came through years of work. You also have people claiming that steroids/anabolics don't change genetics -- so you can't just take testosterone and look like Arnold Schwarzenegger even over a lifetime of training and perfect diet. This brings up a few interesting points that have no clear or reasonable answer:   Is there really a limit to how big someone can get (musculature) without steroids? Or does it just become so difficult to continue seeing progress that people just end up maintaining after a while? If steroids don't change genetics, they can't change potential much, I've heard. If so, would it theoretically be possible to be IFBB level or elite bodybuilder without steroids, assuming the right genetics? Because if steroids DID alter DNA/genes in the muscles, clearly the opposite could be true -- that theoretically anyone COULD also affect how big they could truly get if no drugs were involved. Everyone on steroids won't be as big. Some guys take them with a lifetime of training and never get as big as some of those unbelievably large bodybuilders. If this is true, wouldn't that imply the fact that genetics CANNOT be changed too much with steroids? If so, genetic potential would be somewhat UNCHANGED -- so the ""end result"" would not be affected whether or not one DID steroids -- which could mean that, in theory, with good genetics, anyone can get ""huge"" without the need of steroids in general (since steroids may not actually help much in potential, but just speed up the initial process).   Basically, would steroids change potential? If so, they would do something impossible to do naturally -- which implies they alter DNA/gene expression in muscle cells and synthesis/satellite cells/etc.  If steroids did NOT alter potential much, it implies you can get as BIG and STRONG as steroid users, in theory, assuming your genetics are ""right."" That means steroids aren't ""required."" "
2741,Shoulder feels sore/strained after 10 sets of 10 on Bench Press?,"So I went to the gym today, I got on the bench and did 10 sets of 10 reps, using medium weight, took about 30 minutes to complete, only thing I did other than biking and a few chin ups, and now my shoulder feels a little sore? Does anyone know why? "
2742,Is it okay to take a one week break from the gym after the first one and a half months of training?,I am trying to increase muscle mass.   I completed my first month and a half of training.   Is it okay to take a one week break and come back the week after?   Will it affect my performance? 
2743,Should I include lightweight in my workout if I have an endurance based goal?,"So I have goals involving bulking and getting stronger(increasing my bench, squat, curl, etc.), but recently I have put into action a goal to do 100 push ups in a row. Will lifting lighter weights help me get to this goal faster? And if won't interfere with my bulking in the process? "
2744,Why do I look the same after 9 months of gym?,"I have been hitting the gym for past 5 years but I did take long breaks in the middle, one of them being a year long and others being one to three months. However, recently I have been going to the gym regularly for last 9 months, but I look the same as I did before 9 months ago. My workouts are mostly focused on upper body and do take a day off after 2 days of workout and also have been following this workout plan for last 3 months. I eat a lot of vegetables and chicken. I am 5.8"" tall and weigh 85 kgs, little bit on the plum side; I believe thats because of the excessive intake of white rice.  Why do I still look the same ? Is it because I workout in the evening (lot of people said, for better results I should work in the morning) mostly with a empty stomach. I work out in the evening because the gym is close to my work place and I can do my workouts in my own pace without thinking about being late for work. After my workout, I am deprived of food for next 2 hours because thats the time it takes me to reach home, I try to avoid any outside food. Also I have never tried protein shakes either, should I be taking it ? I can see results in one of my friend who recently started taking whey.  Edit:   My goal is to get a muscular but lean body. Like this guy in the picture  [website]"
2745,"Going at the gym in early in the morning other than in the evening, how hard should I go?","I'm a member of a local gym which I attend three/four times at week, after my work schedule is finished. Lately I've been waking up early in the morning, early enough that I'm thinking to go at the gym in the morning before going to work.  My workout routine is quite standard, I do some cardio as warm up, then I lift weights, and some abs exercises in the end. By standard routine I mean I'm not one of those guys who have a ""massive"" body and ""massive"" strength (I'm in shape and I can lift enough and I'm happy with that).  For example where a ""tough guy"" could lift I don't know... 40 kg I could lift 28 kg.  I don't have any kind of physical problems, literally I get there because I wanna keep my body in shape.  I don't know how hard should I go for an early gym session. Is there anything I should keep in mind? Can I follow more or less the same routine (specifically in terms of intensity) I usually follows in the evening? Should I do more? Should I do less? "
2746,Why does deadlifts makes you feel like you are going to pass out? Can it be avoided?,"More than any of the other exercises that I do, whenever I complete a set (10 reps) of deadlifts (appx 175 pounds not as much as I see other people do), I feel the need to hold on to something or sit down.  Why is that?  I've even seen videos of people passing out after doing deadlifts.  Can this be avoided / effect minimised?  "
2747,Barbell position during squats,"When I squat, I cannot find a proper position that completely alleviates discomfort from the barbell. If it's too high, I find that I immediately feel a strain in my neck. Any further, it feels like the entire weight is against my spine.  During barbell squats, are you suppose to carry the barbell with your hands? Or maybe your shoulder blades?   Where is the ideal barbell position? "
2748,Can I increase flexibility by strengthening muscles?,"I do not believe in static stretching. When one stretch one is telling the nervous system that it is safe to allow a larger range of motion (ROM). This has to be repeated daily over months for the nervous system to take notice.   But is it safe to allow a larger ROM? I for instance can only do about a 90 degrees split as opposed to a full 180 degrees split. And with good reason; I am heavy and the deeper I go down the stronger the forces on my groin musculature becomes. My nervous system protects me from muscle tears by restricting my ROM.    So I believe that lack of flexibility is in fact really always a lack of strength. If I had really strong groin musculature my nervous system would allow me to do a full split.  More specifically I believe that the problem is lack of strength in lengthened state. Take a look at strength as a function of muscle length:     The problem here is the steep downhill on the right side. As an example say that my 90 degrees split is halfway down this hill. My nervous system will not let me lengthen my muscles any more than this because I am too weak in that position.  Bodybuilders sometimes work on their biceps peak by doing restricted ROM curls. This tells us that it is possible to change the shape of this curve (to some extent at least).  This figure from ""Altering the Length-Tension Relationship with Eccentric Exercise"" shows how eccentric exercise can shift the strength length curve:    So I think that in order to become more flexible one should work on strength in lengthened state.  Am I wrong?   If not: how do one best do that?   This article: Eccentric Training for Flexibility provides some scientific references that seems to back up my assumptions and suggest that eccentric training may be the solution.  But how do I perform eccentric training in practice? Since I will be working in the lengthened state where the muscles are weak I conclude that I must use light resistance.  I would also think that the exercises should be performed slowly.  Some exercises like the cossack squat seems to be a mix of light strength training and stretching. I would think such exercises are the solution since they strengthen the muscles trough a full range of motion?    Mark Rippetoe seems to hold the position that the solution for better mobility for squatting is, drumrolls, more squatting. In his response to ""Squat Depth Issues - The Chicken Or The Egg?"" he recommends to ""let the weight provide the stretch"" which sounds like eccentric excercise to me.

2749,my easy run speed will help me or not?,"To build a good running foundation, I come to know that I have to increase my weekly mileage (by avoiding injury). I found that I should do most (90%) of my run as easy.  Earlier, I use to push myself in every session to give my best time.  But now, I started running with 7km/hour speed for  5km unlike earlier where I need to push my self every day to run with Average speed 11.5km/hour. My PB for 10k(56:43min used strava) and 5k outdoor(27:28 used strava) Gym(25:55min treadmill). Will my current easy speed help me to build the good foundation?  How many days in a week should I run?  Current weekly mileage is 30KM and I want to increase to 70KM by increase 10% each week.     "
2750,Is it correct that walking is better than jogging to reduce thighs and inner thighs fats?,"I've been doing sport, particularly, walking, for around 1 year. Each day, 7 days per week.   I didn't use a specific diet, but I cut eating any sort of sugars during the week, except for weekends, where I can treat myself.   The main problem is that I am not fat, I am 165 cm tall and weighing 56.6 kg, with regular shape, but the moment I sit down my thighs go very wide. I have big inner thighs.  So I decided to stop walking and do jogging instead, each day for 45 to 50 minutes.  But my thighs went slightly wider, as it become bigger. It is like someone inject them with air.  I went for a dietitian and said it is okay, but you should lift weight. I don't want big muscles, neither big thighs.  My scale test (the scale used at dietitians) shows that I have 7 kg of muscles in each leg, and 1.6 kg of fat.  After doing some researches, I found this article, which saying that reducing thigh fat should start with reducing overall body fat first, and afterwards, doing walking, and not running, to target the inner thighs:     In all my experience, the best exercise for getting rid of inner thigh   fat is walking. Not running, swimming, cycling, elliptical, dancing,   etc. WALKING.      I know it sounds too simple right?! But don’t underestimate it.   Walking is the absolute best exercise for getting rid of the excess   fat here.      Unfortunately, though you need to do a lot of walking. By a lot, I   mean 10,000 steps per day (or 10kms if you can!) at least. I know this   can be time-consuming and lots of people don’t have this time.      But the 10,000 steps doesn’t need to be done all at once. You can   accumulate these steps during the day.   So is it correct that only walking, for 40-50 minutes, 3 to 4 days per week with a low fat/sugars diet help reduce thigh perimeter and fat ? "
2751,Is this a proper training schedule for best results?,"I am a 54 year old male that has been weight training for over a year. I run a construction business and work pretty much everyday.   Sometimes it's difficult after work, but I try to lift every day. My present routine is:    Day 1) 6 sets of bench press, super setted with tricep press Day 2) 6 sets of Wide grip pull-downs super setted with bent grip curls Day 3) 6 sets of close grip upright rows no super sets (yet)    And I start over on the 4th day.   I see results in my physique (albeit slowly). I always eat 3 square/quality meals (big breakfast, sandwich and fruit at lunch, and whatever is on the table for dinner) and I've also added 3 eggs, 3 bananas, some whey powder supplement drink every other day at around 2PM.  I'm 6'2"" tall and weigh about 207 pounds. I don't have a ripped gut, but don't have any flab neither. Here's what I'd like some help with: Is my routine an ideal one? Can it be improved? Should I increase my sets? Should I rest more for faster growth?   BTW: my equipment is some sort of all-in-one cable station. I don't have free weights (yet), but presently cables are my only weight equipment. Thanks for any advice and suggestions.   Sincerely,  -Tony D. "
2752,Biceps growth after biceps curls,"I go to gym 4 times a week. I do various exercise using different machines (chest press, leg press, row etc). On each of these machines I do 3 sets with 10 reps. I also do 6 sets of bicep curls using 20 pounds dumbbells. I noticed that after using dumbbells my biceps look much bigger but after half an hour or so my biceps go back to same size where they were before the exercise. My question is.    Why do biceps grow so much right after the curls? How can i make my biceps permanently bigger?   Thanks "
2753,Is it healthy to drink liquids that are high in sugar during a bike ride?,"I had really bad headaches right after long rides, so I went to a doctor. They recommended that I drink a sports drink during the ride to replace my lost electrolytes, or get a premade mix from the pharmacy that I can spoon into my drink bottle. I had a ride today, and since I had forgotten to buy a premade mix, I decided to google how to make one myself.  I have 2 drink bottles. I put just water in one, and the mix in the other. For that, I filled the bottle up with water, added about 8 tsp of sugar (I read a few websites, all of them recommended 15 teaspoons per 1 litre, that seemed crazy high, so I decided to start off small), 1/4 teaspoon of salt, and a load of lemon juice and some lemon slices to that I could actually drink the thing.  My ride today was not that far compared to normal, but I did notice that I was doing better and felt better during the ride and afterwards.   Is it fine for me to keep doing this? I had a look, and a litre of Powerade has about 70g of sugar, while my homemade mix had 32g. Obviously less, but I wouldn't expect to drink Powerade every time I ride either. So what should I do?  "
2754,Alternative to protein shake after gym,I get the feeling if I don't drink protein shake after workout I feel low. Is it a mind thing or is it really a nutritional fact that hits the body? I usually don't go to gym and it has been 1 year since I could afford any supplements so I stopped it as I think I will be putting my body under stress if I don't have protein shake.   Is it really true or just my mind being lazy? What are the alternatives when one does not have protein powder to gulp down? 
2755,Does possession of a certain quantity of bodyfat effect the body’s capacity to build muscle?,"Does possession of a certain quantity of bodyfat effect the body’s capacity to build muscle? Or is it an irrelevant factor?  In order to build muscle, which adds weight to the body, a caloric surplus and sufficient protein intake is required. If bodyfat is sufficiently high however, the body can utilize the energy produced from the breakdown of that fat to build muscle even while in a deficit. This is of course not possible with a lower bodyfat percentage.   Powerlifters and Bodybuilders alike seem to build more muscle while their bodyfat is higher. And while lean and thin people are certainly capable of building muscle too, is it really at the same potential rate of development?  As a disclaimer, I’m not asking exclusively if there are massive differences between the various ranges of bodyfat, I’m asking if there is any research or evidence showing that notable differences (small or large) exist. "
2756,Is Thumb position important in dumbell exercise,"While doing any dumbbell or barbell exercises, is it okay to place the thumbs 'outwards' instead of curling them on the grip? For instance, when doing a hammer curl, can I put my thumbs outwards, inline with other four fingers? What is the recommended position of thumbs in dumbbell or barbell exercises? I am asking this question because in my case it hurts a bit near right forearm vein near wrist if I keep my thumb in curled position while increasing weight in further sets. "
2757,Optimal balance of exercises for a squat-less leg day,"I would like to move away from barbell squats during leg day. Here is the leg program I have in mind (one day per week as part of a four-day lifting routine):   EITHER Bulgarian Split Squat (5x5)/Hack Squat (5x5)/Leg Press (4x8) Dumbbell Romanian Deadlifts (4x8) Dumbbell Lunges (4x8) Calf Raises (3x15)   Is this a suitable program for leg hypertrophy? I am also doing 30 minutes of interval cardio on the elliptical and exercise bike 2-3 times per week. Am I missing any particular muscle group? And Which of the three (split squat, hack squat, leg press) should I target? "
2758,What does it mean if I burn more calories than I intake?,"I'm really unhealthy. I have virtually no physical activity.   Well I'm trying to change this. So to start out, I'm doing couch to 5k. If you don't know what it is, it's just a beginner running routine with a mix of jogging and walking.   I started today. I did my first run. But now I'm trying to also focus on my caloric intake so I don't just eat what I've burned off. But I'm confused.   I have an app called my fitness pal I don't know how accurate it is, But according to this app, my 30 minutes of exercise burned about 330 calories.   It also has a Calorie log.  According to this log, I ingested 1300 calories but my maximum allowed is 1500. And then it says I burned off 330 calories which means there's 1000 left. So in theory I could eat 500 more calories and still be fine, right? That just doesn't make sense to me. Because even though I ate less calories than it says to eat, I ate junk food. I ate pizza rolls, chips and a bacon cheese burger throughout the day. I know that's unhealthy food. Next time I go grocery shopping I'm buying healthier stuff. But today that's what I had. And what I don't get is that I thought it was grams of fat that caused me to be fat, not calories. Those foods have about 50 grams of fat in total. Shouldn't I be worried about that and not calories?  I don't understand. Why monitor calories but not how much fat I take in? Which one do I worry about to not cancel out the running I do?   I also have a friend who told me that without supplements, running isn't going to help me lose very much weight and I should just go to the gym instead. Is this true? Am I wasting my time trying to lose weight If all I do is jog, without taking any weight loss supplements? "
2759,Looking for an interval training app that allows customize laps,"I'm looking for an android app that allows me to customize the intervals I want to train.  For example, training 3 minutes in maximum or near maximum intensity followed by 3 minutes of recovery time.Then another round of training 2:30 min by 2:30 mins of recovery and so on until 30 secs of training by 30 secs of recovery.  After that, the times will increase upwards to get again to 3 min of maximum intensity by 3 of recovery.  I have reviewed a lot of apps and none of them seem to have this feature? Does anyone have a good suggestion? "
2760,Gain muscle mass for fat loss,"One of my aims is to gain muscle mass to increase fat-burn.  What would be a good way to achieve this?  It should be natural to concentrate on big muscles, but from what I understand legs for example are not so easy to increase, as we use them a lot (While it is easy to increase the arms muscles, but it won't contribute a lot to the total mass).  How important are ""core muscles"" in terms of body mass?  (I have been thinking that Pilates might be good because it gives a relatively small increase in a large mass of muscles?).  Upper body in general?  Are there specific exercises that will increase mass quickly because the muscles are used differently?    The aim is to have a quite moderate program, mostly at home, to be just a bit stronger / more musculus than I would otherwise be.  I am looking at high gain/pain, preferably with only one set pr exercise.    add 1: relatively quick return "
2761,Stomach muscles burn after doing crunches?,"I used to be able to do 100+ crunches, but now I can only do 40 and my abs feel like they're burning so badly(after). I don't do crunches often anymore. I lost weight(about 5 pounds) before this started happening. I don't have a six pack. Why are my abs burning so bad? Help? "
2762,Can substituting beets with other nitrate rich vegetables to improve athletic performance?,"Beet roots have been known to improve endurance and reduce oxygen consumption during exercise.  Can other nitrate rich vegetables produce similar effects?  Studies seem to focus mainly on beets for athletic performance. Other vegetables  can be a good source of nitrates. If the test subjects drank swiss chard juice or beet green juice, can we be confident that it would be as effective as beet root juice?  Here's a table showing the nitrate content of vegetables.   "
2763,Train hamstrings unilateral?,"In my opinion, it's pretty much like common sense that it can be quite effective to not only train bilateral (Squats, Bench Press, Bent over Rows, Deadlifts) but also unilateral (Split Squats, DB Bench Press, DB Rows) from time to time, for various reasons. One of them being to prevent imbalances.  However, now I'm wondering: For pretty much every bilateral exercise there is I can easily think of a unilateral alternative, except for the Deadlift. The Deadlift (or Romanian Deadlifts, if you want to hit the hamstrings harder), to me seems to be a one of a kind exercise where I can't really think of a substitution.  Are Dumbbell Deadlifts a thing? If yes, are they worth trying? Or am I better off training Leg Curls unilateral to hit the Hamstrings, even though they might not activate them to such a big extend as the Deadlift? "
2764,Can you aggressively lose fat and maintain muscle?,"I heard of an old buddy that claimed he could aggressively lower bodyfat if needed (say he was feeling a teeny-bit chubby and wanted to get as ""firm and lean"" as quickly as possible, say for beach day) within 3-5 days. He says this can be done without muscle loss if you eat a protein surplus and eat above TDEE, but then do cardio excessively.  He claims that the body will get ""fooled"" because it would have had a small period in which it was overly nourished (a surplus to feed muscles), but then you can aggressively do cardio to deplete fat stores while the body is still using the surplus of nutrients -- and then give it a 6-12 hours split and repeat, or flip  it backs (i.e., skip cardio and eat excessively -- next day, skip eating and cardio more).  He says this works and he maintains muscle and can slim down 1-2 pounds on short notice and hide any belly bloat/lack of firmness from a possible big day or two of heavy eating.  Bloating//belly can be reduced in 1-2 days with cardio and eating at or above TDEE with the beneficial addition of cardio and heavy abdominal work to tighten/firm the stomach and burn maybe 2 calories in the target region (yes, spot reduction is mostly not working, but long-term use still burns fat locally).  Basically, does this make sense? Does any evidence show this can generally work (outlined above)?  I ask because I might be going to the beach in a few weeks, but I've been slacking off exercising and eating a little too much junk -- and I got a teeny-bad case of belly bloat and want to look solid/firm. "
2765,Weight training with barbell against two kettlebells,"What difference does it make for my training if I don't use a barbell, but have two kettlebells (or two dumbbells)?  To restrict possible answers, imagine a comparison for deadlifts, squats or bench presses. Deadlifts specially interest me.  I'd be using the weight training as a complement for bodyweight exercises. Specially the deadlifts seems difficult to substitute for some bodyweight exercise. I can't think of any bodyweight exercise that engages so many back muscles.  In summary, does it really matter whether the weights are connected by a bar or disconnected from each other? "
2766,Is drinking a Coca Cola actually a net energy loss?,"I heard from my chemistry teacher that if you drink a Coca Cola you will get quick energy boost but after 40 minutes or so the takein of such a soft drink will actually result in a net loss of energy partly because it is a cold drink and partly because of the drink itself.   Is it true?  If we compare the same amount of carrot juice and Coca Cola or Mountain Dew or Jolt, how big is the difference in energy difference from taking it? "
2767,"36 eggs a day, is it legit?","I watched a video about Vince Gironda's 36 egg a day diet in which it states that the diet is similar to taking a cycle a dianabol. The basics of this idea is that eating dozens of eggs per day would result in higher testosterone levels from 2 sources. The first reason from having higher cholesterol levels, would be cholesterol as a metabolic substrate of androgen and estradiol. The second reason comes from eggs possibly still having active hormones in them. Now I am sure that it might not be close to as effective as D-bol, but has anyone tried it? Does it seem to work? Is the reasoning behind the claim legit?  There's even a interesting study that states that 35 eggs a day helped burn victims recover faster. "
2768,How to fix my uneven pull up?,"  I have a problem with my pull up; When I'm pulling myself from the bottom position my right elbow seems to be more flared out than my left, it also happens when I'm doing close grip pull up. During the pull ups, I have no idea it's uneven, I just feel they are normal (even). Maybe posture problem? Or muscle imbalance?  May you give me solution or advice to fix this problem?   Addition:   It also happen when I do close grip pull up..  My right elbows always seems to want to flare more than my left as you can see in the second picture. "
2769,Planks vs. Sit-ups / crunches,"Are planks effective for building nice abs?  I've tried a few basic positions and the idea of holding a position for as long as I can, and having a workout for my abs and core areas, is pleasing, compared to dreadful sit-ups / crunches that make my neck so tired.    Can planks be as effective for building flat abs / 6-pack, like crunches and sit-ups are?  If so, I rather do a couple minutes of planks everyday ...   But I'm guessing there are diminishing returns with planks ...  "
2770,"Running with bunions: technique, shoes, etc","Are there any other runners out there who have bunions on their feet? If so, has running led to any long-term or short-term health problems? Is it worthwhile to get a special pair of shoes to accommodate the bunions?  I've heard conflicting answers on this, from both professionals and well-meaning people who don't necessarily have bunions themselves. I don't think my bunions have affected my running, though I've been told that I walk on the outside of my feet, and when I run, my feet roll towards the inside, onto my bunions. I've also been told that my bunions raise the risk of hurting my arch, or cause me to run flat-footed. I was told this by a running-shoe salesman, however; in reality, how bad is it to be running flat-footed? Having read Born To Run, the jury's still out for me there.  My bunions are the type where the joint where my big toe meets my metatarsus (the inside edge of the balls of my feet) protrudes outwards significantly more than usual. The bones of my feet have just grown that way; it's not a case of chafing leading to calluses, as I originally thought bunions were.  (Also, for reference, I'm just an amateur runner; I don't work on any particular goals except for continuous running, and I usually just toss on my shoes and go without planning much beforehand.) "
2771,How does a layperson measure the effectiveness of a strength building program?,"People who have difficulty articulating their fitness goals may begin a workout program with the hope that it will simply ""build strength"".  Also, workout programs are not uncommonly recommended solely on this same merit, that any such program will ""build strength"".  Evaluating a program based on the progress it allows in performing its specific movements does not evaluate the program in terms of strength in general.  Deciding a formal definition of strength would allow objective evaluation, but it would also require tools which do this evaluation using a movement that avoids simply measuring one's ability to perform that specific movement.  Such tools would likely not be readily available to non-professionals.  For the desired result of building strength, how does the layperson measure a workout program's effectiveness in achieving that goal?  For a program already in place, what measurements are to be compared between the present and the point before starting the program?  For a proposed program, what are the measurements that one needs to clarify that the program is presumed to improve?  Note:   This question is not asking for possible properties or components of such a program (this is covered by answers to other existing questions).  A measurably effective program may not necessarily hold the same properties as other similarly effective programs. It is acknowledged that clearly defining fitness goals allows a program's effectiveness to be more easily measured; this question is asking about cases where a program is being used or recommended without a more specific goal than presented above.

2772,I am an Overweight Male and want to get ripped where do I start,"I am 23, 6'1"", and weigh 212 pounds.   I want to get lean by the summer and start a new healthy lifestyle. I play soccer every Sunday and play air-soft or mountain bike every other Saturday. I get extremely fatigued every time I do these activities and shows I am out of shape.   I want to workout everyday.  Now my question is, should I wake up every morning and do cardio then go lift weights every evening after work?   When I do cardio would it be a good idea to stick with HIIT or running, or should I do both?   Should I workout once a day?   When I workout should I lift heavy and low reps or stick to low weight and high reps? Also should I do full body workouts when I lift or workout 1 muscle group at a time and then work my way up to 2 muscle groups per workout?   Then the big question is nutrition. Will intermittent fasting work? Should I stick to 6 meals a day? Then what foods do I eat? I am not really working towards a specific weight goal. I just want to feel healthy and be a mean looking son of a gun.   Where do I start? "
2773,Three weeks of sore legs - possible overtraining - how should I address this?,"I've been working out for about two and a half years and have been mostly using Fitness Blender (which is wonderful).  I had reached the point where I could comfortably do one of their 40 minute level 5 workouts for five days a week (upper body, lower body, kickboxing + abs), then one of the 1,000 calorie workouts one day, and then a rest day.  I was on this routine for about two months.   But now for the past three weeks my legs have been sore and achy, to the point where I can't do jumping jacks for more than twenty seconds because the pain is too much.  It was worse in the first week.  I have tried toning it down and took three days off at a stretch once, doing only a brief warm up every day.  Otherwise I've gone down to 300-400 calorie workouts (instead of the 500+ I normally did) and have tried taking an additional rest day in a week.  Hasn't improved.  I went to a doctor as well, who did a series of blood tests, said he thinks nothing serious is wrong and prescribed painkillers and a multivitamin.  I think I match some of the features of overtraining (unusual pain, low rate of improvement, excess fatigue, am going through a lot of personal stress) but not others (not much irritability or reluctance to exercise - in fact I want to).    I am reluctant to simply stop working out.  So my question is, should I simply leave off lower body and do upper body and core for a week or two?  Might that resolve the issue?  Upper body doesn't seem unusually sore.  Or should I leave off training entirely for a week? "
2774,Cardio/workout recovery: Potato chips v sports drink,"I have a question on recovery after cardio.  Given that hydrating and electrolyte post-workout is vital, what is the virtue of sports drinks over water+potato chips (baked)?  To be clear, this is a question about quality not quantity of nutrition, or even better options such as real potato or bananas.  To wit, both have sodium and potassium, but while sport drinks is otherwise sugar, potato chips have a little bit of sugar, fiber, carbs, fat and protein.  All of which are, in general, vital nutrients and nutrition-delivery mechanisms.  On top of that, potato chips are more delicious/satisfying (IMHO) plus in general, both electrolyte-per-calorie and nutrition-per-dollar is higher than for sports drinks (at least the version with water).   So the question is, what, if any, of the potato-chip carbs/fiber/fat/protein is counterproductive to the overall health benefits of cardio?  maybe glycimic-index?  To me however, it seems like the opposite would actually true.  Indeed, I would go as far as to recommend baked potato chips (+water) over sports drink, but it does not seem to be a recognized option for post-workout recovery.  Certainly, I think for intra-workout hydration, sports drinks might be better, less loggy, but what about post-workout?  Does potato chips have a bad reputation from the old days, or is there a genuine reason for avoiding it. "
2775,Look leaner in 45 days,"I want to look as slim as possible within 45 days. I know it's a weird question, I want some advice.  Currently, I am going to the gym for working out since January. (3-4 days per week).  I do cardio for 30 minutes(which includes striding, cycling and cross runner machine) and weight training for about 1 hour and 15-20 minutes abs workout.  In diet, I consume 4-6 egg whites, 30-45 gms for whey protein powder, veggies, oats, rice and chapati/bread.  My age is 22yrs, weight is 85kg and height is 5ft. 9in.  Target areas are the abdomen, face, and chest from where I want to reduce fat and this will make me look more leaner.  Dietitians and gym trainer near me are very costly and I cannot afford them.  What should I do for the next 45 days?    Does weight training help in losing fat fast? Will eating no or low carbs and fat affect my health? Should I increase the time and intensity of cardio and decrease the time for weight training?   Please help me. "
2776,"Why am I unable to run as fast as I should be able to, based on my VO2max","Based on various calculations, I should, purely based on my VO2max, be able to run 10k in under 40 minutes. However, my PR is closer to 50. Why is this the case?  My VO2max was calculated at 59.9 ml/kg/min, which should put my 10k race time at 36(!) minutes, according to this link.  I'm interested in the most likely factors limiting my speed. If more data is needed please let me know. "
2777,Is there any benefit in stretching with weights?,"The kind of stretching I'm referring to is the sort some schools make their kids do at morning assembly. Skip through parts of this video to get a general idea. [website]In a nutshell, the stretching involves standing with feet shoulder width apart and moving your arms up/down/around. So doing this with weights seems like a dynamic version of holding your arm straight out with a heavy weight (known to be a good shoulder workout).   Is there a benefit to doing these with a weight in either hand. Has anyone done this?   "
2778,Does the kind of sport you participate in in your early childhood define the type of physique you end up with?,"As a baby I was really heavy and now I'm one of the skinniest dudes in my family.   They tell me stories about how people used to come up to my mother and utter the words ""Gosh, I haven't seen a child as healthy as yours"" and then I got into my teenage years and ever since have been on the skinnier side. I even joined my local gym and was committed to it for 4 years but eventually lost patience because it didn't work out for me at all, I gained a lot of strength but not much muscle and when I quit, it only took a month to return back to my old skinny self.   Now as a child till the 9th grade, I used to run a lot. Me and my friends, instead of picking up bats and balls, we would play tag a lot and it didn't take long until I became the fastest among my friends.   It got me thinking, did I actually end up with a runners body because I trained it to be that way as a result of what I did in my early days? As the chubby child that I was, shouldn't I be on the similar scale now as an adult? "
2779,"If I wear my Fitbit One on a treadmill or elliptical, should I log the activity as well?","The FitBit Activity Tracker (on the website, Android application, and I would presume the iPhone application as well) lets you log various activities so you can track and share them with your friends. You can explicitly log things like running, using a treadmill or elliptical, or other activities that would also cause the device to count steps and miles. The device (and the website) also track your calories burned based on your profile, and when you track activities, it also estimates the calories burned based on the type, duration, and other parameters of the activity.  I've been trying to determine how exactly FitBit uses the activity tracker data. Does it convert miles run to steps (meaning wearing my FitBit when tracking a treadmill activity would cause double counting)? Or perhaps is the device smart enough, based on the start time of the activity, to not double count? Or are the things like distance, time, and calories burned in the activity not totaled with your device data?  I'm mainly concerned with the things tracked by the device: steps, flights of stairs, miles, and calories burned. At the end of the day, I'd like at least a reasonable estimate of these things.  I couldn't find anything in the FitBit FAQs as to what is recommended, nor many discussions on how others deal with this. "

2782,Standing Desk is giving me neck and upper back pain,"I've had a geekdesk (height adjustable desk) for several months, and I've really liked it.   My back feels great. I'm not tired. My legs have adjusted to standing a lot. Recently, my neck and upper back have felt really tension while using the desk. Might it be because I have my arms and hands fixed on the desktop while typing? I'm not sure. Perhaps monitor placement?  If anyone else has had this problem, I'd like to hear what you did to adjust. Any suggestions welcome. "
2783,What is the purpose of dropping weights?,"I see a lot of exercise training videos, particularly for dead lifts that seem to recommend this.  The trainers will do several reps of the dead lift and upon completion of the last lift, they simply let go of the bar and let the weight drop to the floor.  This seems to be more common with heavier weight.  Why drop the weight rather than make a controlled descent to the ground again?  Does this do something to help increase performance? "
2784,Is protein the only intake needed for muscle gain?,"There are three types of muscles in the human body: Skeletal Muscle, Smooth Muscle and  Cardiac Muscle (heart muscle).  Among them, we focus on the weight gain of skeletal muscles only.   Skeletal muscles contain approximately 75% water, 20% protein, 1–10% fat, and 1% glycogen. [Section-3]   From these facts, if I kept the water aside. Then is it only the protein that is required for muscle growth? Since fat and glycogen are in minor amounts, discard them.  Am I missing anything? I mean are there any other sources to build muscle gain along with protein?  "
2785,"My forearm hurts, should I lower my barbell weight?",I have just increased my barbell weight from 18kg to 24kg for when I am doing bicep curls.  I've noticed that I am getting a slight pain in my forearm (closer to my elbow) as I raise the bar.  Is this an indication I might be attempting to lift too much? Or do you think after some more training the pain may subside (increase in strength)?  I have already read this question but my pain is during the lift rather than after. 
2786,What is the scientific explanation for beginning weightlifters' ability to gain muscle and lose fat simultaneously?,"I'm sure you have heard this a million times in bodybuilding articles and forums:      Only beginner weightlifters can gain muscle and lose fat at the same time.   For intermediate and advanced weightlifters, they can only cut or bulk, but never both at the same time.   Can you give me a biological explanation of how a beginner can paradoxically do two seemingly opposite things? Why does this biological process shuts off after the beginner phase?  "
2787,Should I Alternate My PPL Workout To Avoid Adaptation?,I've been doing PPL / Rest(yoga) / PPL 6 days a week for the last 2 months. I absolutely love this program and I made a lot progress during it. My question is should I start alternating my reps/sets or switch to completely different workout program to avoid adaption? I'd love to continue my program as it is but everybody says it's a bad thing and hinder my results. What do you think? 
2788,How to decide between adding reps or adding weight?,"If I feel comfortable with, for example 15 push-ups, should I start making them harder (legs elevated), or add some more to these 15?   If I add reps now, when should I add weight? And if I add weight, when should I add reps?  Especially I want to know what target I should set. "
2789,Exercise order for a particular body part?,"I have been working out for more than a year now.  As there are multiple exercises for a particular body part, is there any order one needs to follow?  Say for example, for chest, people generally do the bench press first, then go for respective upper or lower chest workouts.  Is it OK to break the order or do I need to follow the same order? "
2790,Weight gained using GOMAD strategy,"@DaveLiepmann recommended drinking one gallon of milk a day for gaining quick mass. It does look like a good idea as it is discussed on stronglifts as well.   But another article suggested it is not for everyone.  All ingredients in 1 gallon of milk can be found using wolframalpha.   My questions are:   That’s quite a lot of fat (as they recommend whole milk rather than skimmed milk), sugar, and other things others like vitamins, calcium, phosphorus, etc. Is drinking that much milk good for the body? From what I understand, this is only short term until you reach your desired weight. Is the weight gained primarily of fat? Is it true the weight gained using this strategy will be lost after you stop drinking 1 gallon of milk? I currently consume 500 ml of milk a day, can look at taking another 500 ml given the situation above with fat, sugar &amp; other excessive contents but will mean stop taking any other sugar foods. Will this make a difference in terms of weight gain (as this is not close to 1 gallon)?   I am not trying to open a discussion rather looking for answers specific to my questions. "
2791,10 days to a 5K run,"I am in decent physical condition, but I have not been running for 2-3 months. I have signed up for a 5K in ten days. What training can I do in this short time for the best performance in the 5K?  How far should I run? Should I speed train (fast 400m's) or is it too late for that? Should I practice running 5K or something shorter? How many rest days do I need before the race?  I realize that I should have been training sooner, but unfortunately I haven't. Next time I intend to. I hope this question will be treated seriously because there are a lot of people who have and a lot who will run 5K's with only a few training days available. "
2792,Is doing full body workouts and other sports too much?,"I have 3 days a week to go the gym, while during the weekends I rest, on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays I workout and on Tuesdays and Thursdays I play volleyball.  My workout routine is a full body workout 3x a week, So I was worried about my legs, since I train them 3x a week and jump a lot in volleyball. Is it too much And I should change my workout routine? Or is there a way I can conciliate these two things?  My workouts and meal plan are focused on muscle building. "
2793,Nature of a finisher vs burner exercise,"I recently came across a variety of terms when it comes to structuring a workout, and one of them is the concept of the ""finisher"" exercise.    Aside from my ""pre-question"" , which is ""If they are really mandatory in a well structured regime"" or at least beneficial, comes this confusion I have since out of Youtube videos I've been hearing other terms.  Are ""Finishers"" and ""Burners"" the same? Also I red about ""ladders"", and you can see an example of this one in this athlean-x back workout video on minute 8:38 where he talks about a progression of a barbell shrug exercise to conclude the session, having an ""ascending reps"" nature ([website]Concluding with what is the structure of a finisher workout, thanks.  I tried to not be overwhelming with the question(s)! "
2794,Whats the optimal height for a pull up bar?,"I was looking at some door frame pull up bars yesterday. Now I was standing in my door frame and tried to imagine at which height the bar would be and it seemed a bit low (although I am a bit smaller than average).  What is the recommended height for a pull up bar? Should my arms be slightly bent when standing, should they be straight? Should I be freely hanging (eg jump up to reach the bar)?  I know that I could bent my knees when the bar is too low, but I'd like to know if there is something like a guideline, a montage recommendation or even something like a standard. "
2795,Does Overhead Press damage your Shoulders? Can Pendlay Rows cause Herniated Disk?,"Are the claims in the following video true regarding Overhead Press (also known as military and shoulder press) and Pendlay rows.  Overhead Press Video Section  Row Video Section  That is, does the Overhead Press increase your chance of getting shoulder impingement syndrome if done repeatedly over a number of years, and  does Pendlay rows (and bent over rows) increase the risk of developing herniated disks if done repeatedly over a number of years? Assume both exercises are done with good form. "
2796,Strength training for health tips for an endomorph?,"I am about to embark on a strength training program, most likely Starting Strength possibly blended with aspects of Strong Lifts. I am a 32yr old male who is out of shape (weak and terrible cardio) and overweight but not obese. My primary goal is better health rather than body sculpting or athletic prowess. I'm looking at using strength training since the last time I was in good shape (around 5 years ago) it was primarily due to strength training, simply because I enjoy it (compared with hypertrophy or cardio focused training) and therefore will be more likely to stick with it.  My metabolism and body shape definitely fits the endomorph mould. Are there any tips for modifying the SS/SL type approach slightly, or things to focus on in particular to maximise success for my body type? I read a suggestion (I can't find the link now) that endomorphs should rest less between sets in order to thrash the metabolism (I guess making the workout a little more like cross-fit metcon style, though without the kool-aid). Is this valid? Are there any other things to keep in mind?  It goes without saying that diet is imperative. I think my diet is actually okay, I think I just need to halve my meals and eat the same amount over 6 instead of 3 and cut out the odd sugary snack I fall prey to. "
2797,Do planks tighten up hip flexors? (Back pain when doing core exercises),"So I have really tight hip flexors and weak glutes, abductors and abs.  I've been trying to fix this problem by working my glutes, hamstrings and abductors but I want to slowly start doing ab exercises again.  I know if I do leg raises, situps and other ab exercises, that it's going to make my hip flexors tighter which is what I don't want.  But even though there isn't much hip flexion when doing planks, will doing planks tighten my hip flexors even more?? Is it a good idea to do planks with tight hip flexors? or should I wait until I have strong glutes, abductors and hamstrings? "
2798,Skull crusher exercise positions,"Usually I do flat skull crushers for Triceps but I have seen some guys doing it in incline and decline way.  What is the difference between incline, decline and flat modes?  Is it same as we do incline/decline (dumbbell/barbell) press for chest? "
2799,Am I doing abs workout right and how should I check my progress?,"I am doing abs workout (7 minute app workout 1-2 per day) for ""that slightly muscular sexy abs"" for 2 month now, but I don't really see any visual progress and this makes me really sad =(  Should I change my workout / do it more / try more strict diet?  How to to check my progress (to keep my motivation and to be sure I am on the right way)?  1,75m / 80kg / broad shoulders type "
2800,Is Vinyasa yoga hurting my fitness objectives?,"I am trying to loose weight. My main approach has been to eat healthy, lift weights 4~5 times a week and do Vinyasa yoga (power yoga) 4~5 times a week. I also fit in the occasional  60 minute run on the elliptical (I can't run or do the treadmill because of an ankle injury). I'm not looking to become ""ripped"" but some muscle definition would be nice.   This worked for a few months and I was able to go from 264 lbs to 224 lbs (I'm 5 ft 11), but now I've ""relapsed"" back to 233 lbs.   A friend has told me that the Yoga is actually harming my fitness goals, since the weight lifting builds muscle and burns fact, but the Yoga burns muscle tissue.   I always assumed that the Yoga could only be good for me, especially given the physic of the more experienced Yoga practitioners, but now my friend has me doubting myself.   Is he right? Should I stop the yoga and stick to lifting?     Here are the rough details of my routine:  I cycle through the 4 following workouts (Chest, Back, Shoulder, Arms) taken from this website:  [website][website][website][website]I don't usually do abs or legs because they are already part of the Yoga flows.  I do Yoga 4~5 times a week.   And I throw in one or two 60 minute sessions a week on the elliptical as well.  "
2801,Is it typical for a person to feel discomfort while standing back up straight after a comfortable dead-lift set is completed?,"After I complete some dead lifts, and lower the weight back to the ground and begin to stand back up straight un-weighted, I feel an uncomfortable stiffness (EDIT)in my lower back at the top of my buttocks directly behind my hip bones on both sides, but not the center: ie. definitely not spinal pain.  Why would I feel this only after I stand back up straight from the low position without weight, but not with weight?  That doesn't seem to make sense.  In other words, if I made the same motion with a 200lb dead-lift load for another rep (comfortably), I would not feel this same disconcerting sensation while loaded, but once I stand back up after the set is done, I feel like I am doing the ""old, hunched over, man, 'ow, my back'"", motion trying to stand back up straight unloaded.  It is not a sharp pain, but more of an unsettling sensation, and it is only experienced while I am in transit from being bent over to standing straight up again, and once I am straightened out vertically, the sensation quickly goes away.  Should I be concerned about this, or is this commonly accepted as a normal experience? "
2802,Sprain or strain - what's the difference and how to treat?,"After a week of extensive exercising involving cycling, running, swimming and soccer I woke up Sunday morning with a sharp pain in what I think is my soleus muscle. Definitely not an achilles, but lower than the calf and on the outer-side of my leg.  I don't remember a point during exercising when I noticed it happened, I just woke up that way. I can put pressure on the foot, I can also walk on it and did some very light jogging on it yesterday as my 4 year old was hassling me to play soccer with him.  The pain is sharp and goes from mid way behind the shin up to the bottom of the calf.    Regardless of my situation I think this info would be useful for others, so:  How do I know if I have a sprain or a strain?  What are the differences between a sprain or a strain?  What is the difference in how each of these should be treated?  What should I do later to prevent the injury from returning? "
2803,Is recovery time required to increase muscle after gym workouts,"While reading this post How does muscle build up when we exercise?. I read there that recovery time (rest before your next workout) is important to increase muscle. Now there are 2 questions I want to ask.  1) I go to gym daily 1 hour in morning, my trainer has set schedule for me like 1st day shoulder + bicep, 2nd day chest + triceps , 3rd day abs + back + wings etc(don't exact remember groups, but 2 muscles a day repeated 2 times a week); and repeat this for next three days, and Sunday rest. That is 3 days recovery to a muscle. But after completing his schedule, as I have free time, I take some rest(15 minutes) and do exercise of show off muscles like bicep, triceps and chest(depends on my mood), so my question is will this extra exercise support me to gain muscle or let down the process as I am not giving recovery time to that muscle.  2) Also at night(9-11 pm), I have dumbbells at home so I do exercise of above mentioned show off muscles(any muscle depending on my mood), so another question whether this late night exercise of random-ally any muscle will support or let down my ultimate goal of increasing muscle(muscle size).  I am 28 years old weighting 69 kg. "
2804,"Wool socks are absorbent, but do they smell like the classic wet-wool smell when wet?","I'm thinking of buying some wool socks. I hear they'll help keep my feet cool and dry by absorbing sweat while I bike. That's fine: sweat normally doesn't smell right away.  I don't own any wool socks yet. Out of all the garments I like to wear, only one is made of wool. I wash it by hand. Every time I do, I notice an unpleasant wet-wool smell. This smell begins right away.  When wool socks get wet, do they get the same wet-wool smell? "
2805,What is the optimal bulking / cutting rotation schedule?,"What is the optimal bulking / cutting rotation schedule for maximum muscle gain and fat loss? By bulking, I mean eating tons and lifting heavy. By cutting, I mean eating less and doing more cardio. Examples of schedules include:  At the high frequency extreme:  Week 1: bulk Week 2: cut Week 3: bulk Week 4: cut and so on...   At the low frequency extreme:  9 months: bulk 3 months: cut repeat year after year ...   How do the results differ in each extreme? Or would they be similar? "
2806,Working out vs. active lifestyle,"Is an ""active lifestyle"" enough activity for maintaining health? For example, I don't do any sports. However, five times a week I cycle to work (about 20-25 minutes one way, very slow pace), almost never take the lift and do yoga/pilates once a week. I used to go to the gym but I stopped a few months ago, because of lack of time. At first I thought I'm doing something wrong, but maybe just cycling and occasional activity is enough? I don't need to lose weight. "
2807,Weight lifting always leading to illness,"For about a year now I've been doing the StrongLifts 5x5 weight lifting program. It was about 6 months in that I started to have to pause occasionally while I got over a minor cold - I thought it was just a seasonal thing as winter was setting in.  After a while I'd recover, go back to the gym for a couple of weeks and the situation would repeat. Upon realising the link I'd take a prolonged break from the gym altogether and restart with a big deload (~20%) but within a month or two my immune system would weaken to the point where the process started again.  I'm currently seeking medical advice but after some initial blood tests, and a physical examination there's nothing obvious.  I think I'm being sensible when I exercise, incrementing in 2.5kg stages only after successfully lifted 5 sets of 5 reps, ensuring 48hrs between gym visits and eating extra protein after workouts, extra carbs before, and fruit and vegetables all the time. I'm not even lifting particularly heavy loads - 60kg bench, 110kg dead lift, and 80kg squats are my personal bests.  Can anyone advise on how to strengthen my immune system?  EDIT (to address comments): Sleep - I work out late when the gym is less busy, say 9-10. I get on average 8 or more hours sleep a night, never less than 7. Never had a problem sleeping. Diet - Breakfast is weetabix or other whole grain cereal and whole milk, often a mandarin or similar small orange like fruit. Lunch is usually soup and bread. Evening meal mainly meat, veg and pasta/rice/potatoes. On days where I'm working out I'll eat larger portions than usual. Days after a workout I'll eat additional chicken/tuna throughout the day i.e. as well as normal meals.  Why do I think working out is making me ill? I've gone through the same cycle too many times to realise it's not a coincidence. I wait until I'm well before returning but I'll be run down again after only a few sessions. My previous health regime was football and running and this never happened after physically demanding games. "
2808,Why do runners immediately stop after a run? Does opening your mouth more while running affect oxygen intake?,"Hello all. I've got two questions regarding the way runners run.  Firstly, what I've always thought is that stopping immediately after completing the run (1k / 2k / 3k / 5k) is bad and we should like carry on at a slow pace for some distance.  But why is it that the runners in this video stop immediately after they've completed the run? Isn't it bad for their bodies? (Once  my friend even told me that they would get ""rectum pus"" whatever that is.)  Secondly, what I've always thought is that we should open our mouth ""bigger"" to allow for more intake of oxygen during the run. What I've seen in the same video is that they do not do so. Does anyone know why is it so? "
2809,Effects of wearing gloves,I just purchased a pull up bar and a set of dumbbells. From what I've read there are people who wear gloves at the gym and some don't.  What are the effects and reasons of wearing gloves? Are there any effects besides mitigation of callus growth I might be missing? 
2810,Libido correlated with muscle-potential?,"I have heard often things like guys bragging about having super-high libidos and how that explained why they're jacked and huge. The idea is that super-high libido in men is probably correlated with higher than average testosterone. For example, things like having an orgasm, but being up and ready to do it again (doesn't get ""worn down"" by sexual activity). I don't know about women -- maybe it's the same, but this is aimed more at males. Does a high-libido mean more test/muscle building potential?  Or can a guy with low sex-drive be jacked, but a guy with a high-drive be a notorious hard-gainer?  Are they that tightly correlated? Sex drive and muscle? I ask because I have a higher sex drive than most men and I barely gain muscle with proper training, rest, diet, and exercise.  By 'high sex drive' I mean having sex and/or masturbating 3-5 times per day, every single day. "
2811,How should I continue my running training for fat loss,"I am 5'8"", weigh about 155 lbs. I look rather fit except for my bulky belly.  For the past month or so, I have been running on the Planet Fitness treadmill. This week, I managed to run for 30 minutes (12 mins + 10 mins + 8 mins, with 4 mins and 6 mins break in between). My pace was 10 mins 21 seconds for a mile (5.8 on Planet Fitness treadmill). Also, I didn't use any inclination.  How should I continue from here:   Should I increase the duration of the sets? To maybe 15 mins, 12 mins, 10 mins? Should I try to add another set of 8 mins? Should I try to decrease the break time between the sets? Should I try to increase the inclination a bit? Should I try to increase my pace, so that I do one mile under 10 mins?   BTW, I also do some light dumbbell exercises for ~15 mins after running. "
2812,How to prepare the body for workout in the early morning?,"I usually do sports only in the afternoon or in the evening, because my body needs several hours to work properly after I get up in the morning. I can perform mental tasks very well in the morning and I am productive at work, but physical workout in the gym is entirely different.  My main problem is that my joints are aching. My normal warm-up routine does not really help. I also do not know how I should handle eating. I usually eat about 2 hours before exercising. That's not possible if I want to start the training really early. An empty stomach does not work for me, because I lack motivation and I feel less energetic. This means I have to eat right before the training, which doesn't feel right either.  Easy way out - just workout in the evening. Unfortunately I decided again to try exercising in the morning before work, because this would help my schedule a lot. How should I prepare for that? Which meals are good to consume right before training in the morning and how should I handle my aching joints? More warm-up? Less weight on the machines and barbells? Your help is appreciated - all my attempts to exercise before work have failed so far. "
2813,How often to train to get muscle mass,"I know this is a frequently asked question and it has a a lot of answers on various websites. However, I couldn't get a specific answer for my routine!  I'm interested in bodyweight training and I was told to read Convict conditioning. I did and it was good but the workout routines part got me confused. The routine which was written for the beginners of calisthenics was like that:     - Monday:    (A) push ups &amp; leg raises   3 sets for each exercise     - Tuesday:   off     - Wednesday: (B) pull ups &amp; squats  3 sets for each exercise     - Thursday:  off     - Friday:    (A) push ups &amp; leg raises   3 sets for each exercise     - Saturday:  off     - Sunday:    off Alternating between A &amp; B. Will I actually gain any muscle if I followed this routine ? I'm not an expert but I feel that it's not enough. Any thoughts ? "
2814,"Wide grip pull-ups vs ""normal"" pull-ups","What is the purpose why people do wide grip pull ups? I know that these pull-ups are harder, but I would like to know why. Are there different muscle groups being stressed? Or is a wide grip pull-up equivalent to a weighted ""normal"" pull-up? If the latter is the case, shouldn't one prefer weighted ""normal"" pull-ups because of the greater range of motion?  EDIT: To clarify my question: I'm talking about the pronated grip. "
2815,Why I am losing fat mostly on my upper body and face?,"I am almost 24 and I have to confess that I have been overweight for past 24 years :( I never did any serious sport and never had regular workouts either. I spent most of my life behind a PC or game consoles and also sitting in class!  Let me give you a bit of my history.  My peak weight was ~120kg when I was 17...that year I went crazy and I ate almost nothing in during that summer (Well I can't recall what did I do exactly...) by end of that summer I was about 90 kilos and I managed to keep myself at that weight until a year ago when I graduated and started to work as an electrical engineer (Just to tell you I sit in lab or behind a PC about 8 hours a day). This caused me to go up again to 102kg, I decided to lose weight again but this time I followed a better diet. I forbid a lot of things like any drinks, pizza, fast food, rice and stuff like that...so I mainly went for vegetables and meat (mostly chicken fillet, beef and fish).  I also started jogging and for the past 80 days I almost did about 2 or 3km, 5 times a week and I started to use my bike and also my feet to go around (shopping, work and ...) instead of my car or public transport. Also I never went to GYM :(  At the moment I am 1.83cm tall and 88 kilos. My problem is that I lost most of my fat from around my chest and specially my face...I used to look quite good (hehe chicks always liked my face but never my fatso body :P) and now I can feel my skull under my skin!!!   From belly and love handles and bottom!! almost I feel I did not lose anything...well of course I did but I feel that I just scaled down a bit and still have the same proportions like before :( I only lost 2 size of jeans...I wear 36/36 now but I went from XL and XXL to L for T shirts.  What is my problem? I jogged for about 3 months and I did not drink/eat any food that you could consider fattening.... What should I do?  Please let me know if you need more info about me. Hope to get some nice answers from you guys. "
2816,They say sitting is our generation's smoking but what about people with disabilities like me?,"They say sitting to much is our generation's smoking but what about for someone like me who has a disability that hinders their ability to stand for long periods or just plain move?  I have a physical disability known amyoplasia which is a common form of arthrogryposis. In my case I cannot bend my knees fully (about 45-60 degree angle). I tend to hunch but I could straighten my back. My right foot is turned outward a bit and my balance is ok but not great. From what I have been told, unless I have more surgeries or get in a bad accident, I should not deteriorate like those with MS. My condition makes it difficult for me to move, although I can walk fine if I fall I cannot get up. However if I fall at home I could always use furniture to crawl up and get back up to stand. So because of that I don't walk as much as I probably should. Recently in the past few years I have taken a interest in technology but I'm worried because of all the recent studies and reports about sitting that I am sitting too much. Using a standing desk may help but my feet start to hurt after a few hours of too much standing. Any ideas to help counteract the problem of sitting too much? "
2817,Losing weight with Stronglifts 5x5?,"At 22 years old and 325 lbs (mostly fat) I rather desperately want (and need) to lose weight. However, I'm not a big fan of running. I do some biking, but I've been reading up more about weight lifting to lose weight, and have decided to start the Stronglifts 5x5 program.  What I was wondering is, is that enough on its own? Should I go for longer bike rides on my off days? Are there other weight lifting exercises I should include as part of my routine, or would that be too much with the stronglifts? I have access to a local gym that does have the equipment required, as well as other free weights and machines.  Weight loss is my key goal, but I would like to get stronger, which is another reason I desire to lift weights.  Just for information, I am attempting to eat a healthier diet as well (less junk food, more vegetables etc.) "

2819,Recommended timing for Tabata sprints to supplement olympic lifts,"I'm using one of the Texas Method variants. I want to add tabata sprints to my weekly workout. The question is, when? My choices are:   Monday. I'm already doing 5x5 at 80% of squats, bench, power cleans. Plus planks. Wed. Lighter day: 70% of 3x3 goblet squats and overhead press, plus 3 sets of 12 pull ups and 5 sets of back raises. Friday I do 1x5 at 90% of squats, bench and deadlifts, plus planks.   Should I make Monday a serious depletion day by adding in the sprints, or maybe Friday would be better so that I have the weekend to recover. Recommendations? "

2824,Impact of irregular eating schedule on running training,"I'm planning to train for longer distance races (first a 10k, then a half-marathon), and I was wondering about the detrimental effects of eating at irregular intervals during the day.  Having just started a graduate program, I find it increasingly difficult to eat regular meals. In the last weeks or so I get most of my food in the evening (after 8pm), constantly skipping breakfast and/or lunch.  My question therefore is, how important is the timing of your meals during the day ? (assuming that the total food intake per day is healthy and adequate). Also, given an irregular eating schedule, what food groups work best (to salvage the situation) ? "
2825,"What have you found to be the best, most effective strength exercises to help complete a strict pull up?",In 2018 it was my goal to lose weight (which I have accomplished) but now it is my goal to become stronger; one of the more specific goals I have is to be able to do a pull-up by December 2019.   What kind of exercises should I be doing to help me? And what muscle groups should I be targeting?  I've been told that because I'm a girl it will be harder for me; is this true?  I'm pretty inexperienced and don't have much knowledge about strength and conditioning training so any advice would be helpful!  
2826,Do Different Bench Press Variants Build Muscle Differently?,"I once read somewhere (though not somewhere very reputable) that the incline bench press will build more muscle in the upper chest, while the flat bench press will build more muscle in the lower chest. Is there any truth to this idea?  More generally, how do the different bench press variants (incline/decline/flat) affect the shape and growth of the various upper body muscles? "
2827,Does the temperature of the training environment influence the calorie burn rate significantly?,"The efficiency of the human body, like any other machine, depends on the surrounding temperature. We get exhausted quicker if we run on a hot summer afternoon than we would in the cooler evening. But how does the temperature influence our calorie burn rate?  In a cold environment the body will need to burn calories to produce additional heat, in a hot environment the body needs energy to cool the system. But is this significant during sport? Does it make sense to train in a hot or cold environment to increase the calorie burn rate or is it better to train in a more or less ideal environment? "
2828,Importance of sleep: sleeping less since I increased my training (cycling),"I've been ramping up my training sessions (cycling) for the last few weeks to get in shape for a commitment I made. Getting ready for an ultra-endurance event in 2 years.   I train about 4-5 times a week, during weekdays I tend to focus on recovery rides, interval training and build up my general endurance. During the weekend I ride about 80-130 miles, two days in a row. (If possible) These long rides are to build my mental game, to get used to being in the saddle for long stretches of time and to learn to keep going while being tired.  So far this is doing wonders for my condition, pacing and mental endurance. But one thing I am worried about is getting enough sleep. Naturally, I sleep about 5 - 6 hours a day, I wake up without an alarm. Waking up feeling rested. Since I started training more frequent I see my sleep drop to 4 - 5 hours while not waking up tired. This is extremely short, even for me.   From what I've been told. Sleep is essential for focus, productivity, muscular and skeletal system recovery, memory, energy levels, mood and a lot of others. Although I feel great a.t.m. Should sleeping this little be worrying? What would be causing this drop in sleep?  "
2829,Why does the suprailliac skinfold body fat method depend on age?,"Skinfold measurement charts like the Accumeasure one shown below for suprailliac measurement have the same caliper measurement representing different body fat %s in different age groups. Maybe other skinfold methods, or even other body fat % methods do to?    I can appreciate the skin gets looser with age, but can't see that affecting the measurement, if this diagram below is correct:    A 20 year old male with 25% body fat has a 35mm measurement, a 56 year old with 25% has 17mm. So the skin getting thinner as we age (if it indeed does), isn't significant.  Do we accumulate fat in other, healthier places than is predicted by the suprailliac as we age? I say 'healthier' because the colored bands in the chart above shift their ideals as we age. "
2830,How can you do a BMI test?,"The Body Mass Index is supposed categorize you into a place in a scale to determine how healthy you are. What components would one need to provide to do a BMI test, and why?   If one were to do a BMI test, how might they proceed in doing so - what are the steps involved and how must the calculation be executed? "
2831,Beginner full body routine without squats,"My gym does not have a squat rack, and I can't seem to find any beginner strength routines without squats. Any suggestions? Is it possible to do something like strong lifts with split squats instead? Thanks "
2832,Changing Starting strength to lose Fat,Is it possible to alter Starting strength to lose weight ?  Basically I have three questions :   In the existing program how can a person lose weight ? There are many success stories available on the Internet where people claim they lost a lot of weight on the original program. How does the body burn fat in the original program ? If I increase the Reps from 5 to 6 and slowly to 7 will I lose body fat OR will this turn into too much volume ? Like in point 2 will adding assistance exercises help me lose Fat ?   I have been doing this program for close to seven months now and have put on a lot of muscle mass on this program. To be honest I love this program and it seems to me the only program that works for me. However now I have started to look Fat :-( So over the last two months I tried a few variations to the program as mentioned on SS Forum like keeping the weights constant + reduce calories + workout twice a week. Sadly I have gained 4 Kgs and the last 4 kgs seem to be fat :-( In fact it seems that I might have lost some muscle.  Some additional points : I can workout only 3 times a week + can't do any sprinting because my left knee hurts. All my lifts are close to body weight apart from overhead press.  Please suggest.  Thanks. 
2833,How much exercise should a pregnant woman do?,"It's in most people's knowledge that pregnant women should generally not exercise due to the risk of harming the baby with prolonged and strenuous work-outs.   If one was pregnant, but still wanted to exercise for her health - how much exercise is safe? At what times is it safe to exercise while pregnant?  "
2834,I'm a casual runner & active human. Do I need to work out my legs + lower body?,"I'm 27 and I'm in pretty good shape. I'm getting in even better shape, having signed up for a gym membership a couple months ago for the first time in my life. I've been hitting some free weights, pec press machines (or whatever you call them), the pull-up bar and the treadmill (I run 4.5 miles in about 32 minutes). But I do no leg weights - I'm on my feet all the time - I'm a human! - and these machines seem like a waste of time to me. Still, next month I'm running my first 10K. And I find that often while running, my legs start to ache before I'm exhausted.  Can lower body exercises help me?  Are they worth my time? (I'd rather not spend much more time in the gym than I already do)  If so, which exercises should I do? "
2835,Can glycogen only be used by the muscle in which it is stored in?,"Carbohydrates are stored in the muscles as glycogen. It is a major energy source for weight lifting. I want to know if a muscle can only use the glycogen stored in itself or can it borrow glycogen from other muscles.   I'll give you a practical example. Let's say I do many sets of bicep curls followed by many sets of tricep extensions. Will my tricep strength suffer because the bicep curls not only used glycogen stored in the biceps, but also the triceps? Or will my tricep strength remain unaffected because the bicep curls cannot be fueled by the glycogen stored in the triceps? "
2836,what time should i stop eating at night,"A friend of mine told me that the worst thing to do when trying to lose weight is to eat right before bed as it sits in your stomach and it will make you gain weight.    Is this accurate?  If so, what time should I stop eating  . .1 hour before, 2 hours before.  Is there certain foods that are better to eat late at night if i get stuck in a situation where i am really hungry but have to go to bed soon? "
2837,Difficulty adjusting to body after I fixed anterior pelvic tilt,"I had the symptoms of anterior pelvic tilt, and measured it roughly by standing back and feet against a door and measuring the gap between my lower back and the door.  I did the corrective exercises (glute bridges, hip flexor stretches, etc.) and that gap narrowed significantly.  After I corrected this anterior pelvic tilt, I get lower back pain (a sudden pull during the lift and then 'strain' type pain that lasts for days) when I squat and deadlift.  I used to be able to squat and deadlift a good amount of weight.  Now even after lowering my weight significantly, I hurt myself.  How long will it take to get back up to normal?  I assume this is from my body having to use new (more appropriate) muscles in the lift.  Any more advice on getting back to normal? "
2838,Weight training programs,I've been heavily involved in running over the past few years and now want to bulk up and increase strength and weight.   I've read some questions on here about weight training for beginners however I really wanted to ask - how I should construct a suitable training plan to ensure I am working the key areas?  Essentially I am 185cm and 74kg. I would like to get up to 80kg in a healthy and natural manner. With this I have a strong lower body but a rather week upper body.   How many times a week should I be training? Realistically how long will it take to increase to that weight? 
2839,What is proper form for kneeling cable crunches?,"What is the proper form for doing kneeling cable crunches? Specifically, I am curious about the following:   Should you face the machine, face away from the machine, or are both okay? How should you position your arms throughout the exercise? For example, should they stay extended the whole way down like you are bowing to someone? How should you position your upper body throughout the exercise? For example, do you treat it like a crunch where you start straight and then curl into your chest? What angle should you be starting at? 90, 67.5, 45? Is there anything else I missed out on that I should be conscious of during the exercise?  "
2840,Upper back pain day after push-ups/pulls ups,"So I've been doing push-ups for over six years and the first five years it was quite simple 6x20 sets of push-ups, without any pull-ups. Rarely an injury, and the ones that I had was somewhere at the upper back --though I forgot where exactly.  Now, for the past half year I have increased sets and amount, and added pull-ups to my training routine. As I'm a beginner to pull-ups I take it very slow and build it up gradually. Yet, I have gotten two injuries in the past month from either push-ups or pull-ups. Possible rhomboids injury. A few weeks ago it was my left rhomboid, and last night, out of nowhere, when I woke up to go to the toilet, it suddenly hit me in my right-rhomboid.   I noticed that when I stretch my neck to the left side, I can feel the stretch in my right-rhomboid (where the pain is). when I do push- or pull-ups now, I don't feel the pain.   Yesterday I only did half a set of pull-ups because I was afraid I wasn't warm enough. I usually do a warm-up jog of 5 to 8km, but yesterday, I finished only 4km and walked-out for the remaining 2km. Yet, I completed my full push-up training. So I pressume it's from the push-ups.   What do I do to prevent my rhomboid injury? Is this possible rhomboid-injury from push-ups or is it from pull-ups? Did my body become too cold, after a 2km walk-out, for a heavy training? Is it possible that the rhomboid-inury is caused by bad form, like for example, having your elbows too far out from the body, instead of the proper form where you have them close to the body?   Thank you for your advice people!  [edited: added question #4] "
2841,Walking in order to burn fat,"I am currently reading Biochemistry for Sport and Exercise Metabolism, and there is an interesting chart that shows how if your exercise pace is low (e.g. walking), human body is primarily using body fat as a source of energy and glycogen storage is basically kept intact. Since I am currently in the process of building muscle mass, theoretically this seems like a reasonable way to burn excess fat without impacting my muscle gains. Would this work? Also, what would be the best way to approach this, should I go for a walk 2 hours after a meal so my blood sugar is down and then walk for 1-2 hours? "
2842,What doctor/specialist can assess fat and body composition?,"Question: what kind of doctor should I see to assess whether or not my body fat can be reduced through further diet and exercise?  Background: I've been an avid CrossFitter for over 2 years. I work out about 5 times a week. I eat healthy (mostly paleo plus dairy with occasional cheat meals). In February I started measuring and tracking my food intake via the Zone Diet simply so I can make sure to eat enough food and get enough fat/protein/carbs.  I was fat from elementary school through college due to bad diet and lack of exercise. Now I'm ""skinny fat"" and no matter how I adjust my diet or activity level, my level of ""flab"" does not change. I got down to 165 lbs at 6'1"" and still had flab despite a somewhat gaunt appearance.  My primary doctor examined me and said I would never be able to lose it naturally – I'm stuck with it. While I believe she's right, I'd like to get a 2nd opinion from someone with expertise in body composition. Any direction? "
2843,What is meant by a tight muscle?,What is meant by a tight muscle?  What is an easiest way to identify whether a muscle is tight or not? 
2844,My knees come together when I squat. Is this ok?,"I have been following Starting Strength for about a year and a half. I squatted 3x4 @ 285 lbs today. I was doing 5x5 sets, but read a suggestion on here to reduce to 3x5, and I immediately noticed an improvement (I could increase my weight, which had plateaued). Now, when I can do 3x5 to my satisfaction, I add more weight. I keep my feet slightly pointed out and about shoulder width apart.  Anyway, for the longest time, I have noticed a tendency in my knees to come together as I come up out of the squat. There's no pain or anything, that's just what they tend to do. Is this ok or something I should fix? If I should fix it, how? Deload until they don't come together anymore? "
2845,To what extent is strength training about optimal breakdown of muscles,"In beginner strength training the way it is usually recommended, how much is soreness, DOMS (Delayed Onset Muscle Soreness), and inflammation associated with the productive muscle breakdown that creates stronger muscle as one recovers?  Put another way, how much pain is necessary for strength gains? Bonus points for describing optimal training with minimum soreness while still making progress. "
2846,"Is there an ""optimum level"" of HR for conditioning benefit?","I just bought an applewatch 4 and I want to use it for exercise. So I am scouring the online resources.  However, the workout apps allow you to ""set a goal"" and ""show a report"".   What I want to use it for is to help me regulate my effort continuously so that I can burn the desired level of calories, run the desired distance or run for the desired length of time **while maintaining the ideal HR **.  I remember from gym class that you could get better conditioning training by actually relaxing the tempo so that the aerobic metabolism and respiration exchange was breaking even. For someone who is not in good shape, this would mean to slow down to a walk preemptively.  Was this a myth? Why isn't this a thing with all the smartwatches? Why do I have have to set a target HR? Shouldn't the workout apps figure this out by measuring my efforts? "
2847,How effective are respiratory training devices,"I just stumbled over the Elevation Training Mask, which strives to simulate high altitude training by restricting air flow. Now I'm wondering how much sense such a device would make. Some question that I'm asking myself:   Is this device effective? Does it provide a similar training effect than high altitude training?  Who should use it? Is it made for long distance runners, sprinters, powerlifters, all of the above? Who should not use it? When should one use it? Beginners will probably fall flat on their faces when using it, so how advanced should one be to use it? Are there negative side effects? What could possibly go wrong (short term and long term)when using such a device?    Personal experience and anecdotal evidence is fine, although I would like to see some research if possible :) "
2848,Optimal interval between workouts,"I read somewhere that after breaking your muscles apart (f.e. by working out) they start to repair until the muscles reach their new maximum volume/strentgh. All information which is not new for me, but then the author said something interresting in my opinium. He/she said that after reaching the maximum volume/strength the muscles start to decrease again, I figured the body would probably be consuming the muscle, if it lacks on protein. So he/she implied that one should workout again at that moment, not earlier and not later, in order to experience optimal progress.  Ok, seems all very logical to me, but I still have a few questions about this:   Is this true? If one is following a strict nutrition program, will the muscles still descrease? Or just slower? And what approximate period does it take to get back to the old level (I know this differs per person, but I would like to make a approximation)? How do you know you are at your optimal interval to workout again?  "
2849,Why do I get lactic acid build up at lower threshholds on different days?,"I'm a climber, so I'm talking specifically about forearms. I train regularly and have been for years, so I'm pretty familiar with how my body responds.    As I understand it, the ""pumped"" sensation in the forearms comes from the anaerobic energy usage; it's build of lactic acid.  During my training session yesterday, I experienced more onset of a pump than usual.  I would say it seemed that I was getting pumped, doing exactly my same warm ups and workout as I have been doing regularly for several weeks, at about 80% of the normal threshold.    I know that if I don't warm up good, it sets in faster.  But my warm up was as complete as usual.  What I want to know is what other parameters can affect this?  Was I low on blood sugar?  Were my muscles still fatigued from previous workouts?  Did the cold I had just recovered from matter?  "
2850,Flywheel Working mass parameters of a cross trainer,I have read that better cross trainer devices offer more flywheel mass with 5kg bare minimum.  Now I have found one offer which tells me there is a flywheel with 9kg having a working mass of 24 kg.   How is that posible? 
2851,Bent over barbell row lower back pain,"Felt stiffness in my lower back during a week or so(during bent over barbell rows and squats mainly), but didn't pay much attention to it. Yesterday however I couldn't finish my 4x12 bent over barbell row, because of it. So, I skipped it and did the following exercises fine (lat pull-down, seated row, seated cable row etc). A guy in the gym told me that it is typical and that I should wear belt during bent over barbell rows. Is he right? Should I do some special exercises to strengthen lower back (hyperextension f. e.)? Is it okay to do squats tomorrow? (with stiff lower back) "
2852,What are Some Energy Boosters,"First of all, I am not new to the world of fitness and bodybuilding. I have been training for 4 years straight. I've missed days here and there, but never been away for more than 3-4 days. I can lift a lot and I've always done it.  However, I have recently started to lose a significant amount of my energy half way through my workout (after an hour of working out since I usually work out for 2 hours 5-6 days a week).  At this point you can assume I have NEVER had any energy drinks in my whole life. I honestly am not aware of what they are and how they accomplish their task, and I don't take anything I don't know.  What I am trying to find out is:   what should I consider doing (whether using energy boosters or anything else)? What are the side effects of those energy drinks advertised here and there? Should I consider taking any?   I don't know if my age matters, but in case it does, I am 24 years old. "
2853,Workout using only dumbbells to burn fat and build muscles?,"I have no time to go to the gym, my house is very small to buy large gym equipments and all I can buy is a set of dumbbells. I have only one hour per day to train. Currently I'm 79 KGs and I want to lose weight and build muscles. I don't wanna be a bodybuilder or something, but to have a great looking body, or in other words skinny-ripped.  Can you please recommend a set of exercises/workout using only dumbbells that train all of my muscles (and also allow me to gain muscles) so I can achieve my goal? Is this even possible without those large equipments? "
2854,What controls heart rate while workout?,"I am 31 year old with moderate fitness. I cycle 3 times a week about 40 mins average and my heart rate monitor data shows I average more than many other people on strava. I know beats per minute may be considered as a fitness parameter and was wondering why people like Amanda Coker average out 115bpm after a 300+ km ride and mine turns out to be 140bpm for 10k ride.   What are the factors which control heart beats? Are there any contributing factors like hormones imbalance, blood count, adrenal fatigue etc? "
2855,"How are people doing ""to-failure"" sets of the same repetition count multiple times per session without failing to hit their count on subsequent sets?","I am struggling to understand how people pre-determine their desired rep counts for each set of a training session.  For example, in another recent question, I saw this schedule posted, and it is a perfect exmaple of the type of advice I am referring to:   I don't know about everyone else, but if I walk into the gym and hop up on the pull-up bar, I might be able to crank out 8 chins over the bar from a dead hang... on the first set.  That doesn't mean that every other time I jump up there, I will be able to do 8.  Maybe I will do 4 or 5.  If people are lifting to the rep count as their failure point, then how are they not getting diminishing returns during the same session for subsequent sets?  I see this type of definite-rep-count training plan far too commonly for it to be something that only a small group of people can do reliably.  Can anyone shed some light on this?  What am I missing? "
2856,Do explosive movements necessarily lead to injury over time?,"Many exercise movements are recommended to be performed slowly, deliberately, and under control.  Slow and controlled movements help to mitigate the risk of sudden and excessive stress and twists which may lead to injury.  Explosive movements (swings, cleans, jerks, etc.) by definition do not allow for slow execution, and they seem to lessen the potential for controlled performance.  This would seem to increase the risk of injury from these movements.  However, one may imagine that there are those who perform these movements regularly and over long periods of their workout careers and for whom the cumulative stress produced by these movements results in no significant adverse effects.  Do explosive movements necessarily lead to serious injury over the long term?  If not, how do muscles and joints achieve the ability to absorb the amounts of force that these movements produce, and how does this differ from exercises which are best performed slowly?  Are any of the assumptions in the above paragraphs incorrect? "
2857,Under What Conditions Will Muscles End Up Weaker After Work Out?,"A very, very common situation for me is this - I work out, I rest, I come back weaker. A number of books/people have given reasons for this:   Not enough sleep. Not enough protein. Frequency too high.   Etc. Can we get a comprehensive list of the factors (both behavioral and genetic)? Also, I would like to know what happens when a muscle can't repair itself over the short term. What happens in the long term?   Edit: I am really interested in the question overall, specifically in terms of what genetic potential is. Btw, I have read Supertraining (years ago), so I am familiar with the graph in the comments.     Anyway, my particular situation looks like this:  *7-8 hours of sleep weekdays, work ALL day in front of computer - 10-12 hrs *Workouts look like AxxBxxA *I walk a couple of miles on off-days and do hollow body holds / hip flexor stretches and some grip work, but it's light  A: 3 mile run @ 9min/mile 3 x 17 push ups (full ROM/control) 3 x 17 hanging leg raises 5 x 5 bench @ 185 lbs 5 x 5 row @ 135 lbs 3 x 20 bw squats    B 3 mile run @ 9min/mile Bunch of core stuff - supermans, planks, etc Calf raises, reverse calf raises (3 x 40 bw) Quad/Ham machine 3x8 @ light weight OHP 5 x 5 @ 125 PU 5 x 7 @ bw (200 lbs)    I have been working out for far over decade (in my mid 20s). I have been lifting  seriously for maybe 2 years. My bench was 5 x 5 at 225 lbs earlier this year. I didn't stop, I didn't change anything, I just keep getting weaker. I eat adequately.   Edit 2: Reading my own post I would be tempted to reply ""Check if you are sick"" - but the bench number is the only one that's dropping. OHP went up in the past few months, for example. This is also not the first time this happened. I have had a few more experiences like this with things like deadlift, where I progress, progress, and then suddenly numbers start dropping with no apparent cause (Happened around 5x5 @ 3.5 plate on DL). Btw, squat and DL aren't in the program due to muscle imbalance that I am fixing atm.  "
2858,"Calorie calculation, consumption and side effects of minimum intake","In short, my question is ""How actually calorie calculation works?""  Now, I will try to describe my question in detail. While surfing net I found a calculator which claimed that it can identify my minimum calorie requirement. By reverse engineering I found the formula was nothing but     My Weight * 24 = Total amount of calorie required for my body   Now,     Total amount of calorie required - 500 = minimum intake for my body.   [which truly doesn't applicable for people having 0-45 Kg]   Having said that, I have two question,   How much minimum amount of calorie required for my body when I am doing cardio + normal gym routine + daily home and office work? I doubt about the above formula. What is the best way to reduce weight via calorie control without damaging body.  Ex. If my daily intake is 1200 cal , so do I have to burn more than 1200 cal everyday to reduce my fat?    from my knowledge, more muscle consume more calorie (just like car engine, more  horse power more consumption of gas), so limiting calorie intake can cause damage to my muscle growth?    Sorry for my bad English "
2859,Modified pull ups when the bar is too low,"I would like to be much better at pull-ups.  I can sort of just barely almost do two in a row - on a sufficiently high bar.   Trouble is I am tall enough that in almost all gyms, I can reach the pull-up bars with my feet flat on the ground, my shoulders engaged and pulled down, and my arms slightly bent.  That means that I can't start from a dead hang with my legs straight, as recommended in this answer.  Instead, I have to either:   Bend my knees so that the soles of my feet are pointing backwards. As above, but with my knees further bent, so my soles point up. Bend at the waist with my legs straight out in front - eventually moving toward pull-ups in a seated position with my feet off the ground. Sit in what my daughter would call ""criss-cross applesauce"" fashion. Hold on with a very wide grip. Something else?   None of these approaches seem easier than the others - they all feel pretty darn awkward, and I have a harder time with even getting a single pull-up when the bar is too low (again - most bars)  QUESTION:  How should I modify my leg position when working on a pull-up bar that is too low for a proper dead hang?  Related Questions:    Where should our legs be when we do pull-ups or chin-ups?  What's the optimal height for my pull up bar.  Is moving my legs forward on pull-ups a bad things? "
2860,Diet plan - looking for feedback,"I'm currently working on weight loss.  I'm 25 years old, and work most of the day in the front of the computer(work).  Height: 183cm, weight: 89kg  I'm doing 3x15 pushups and 3x25 crunches every day. In addition, once per week/two weeks I'm running ~7km (1 hour long run). Here's my idea for diet:  Breakfast: 1 vanilla yoghurt, 1 banana, 1 banana (~1hour breaks between each meal)  Midday meal: Cesar salad/chicken with rice (alternately each day)  Supper: 2 sandwitches with white cheese and cucumber  And one (1.5L) bottle of water and couple cups of tea (green, no sugar).  Whad do You think? Is it good to loss weight fast? "
2861,Is the resting burn rate included when the calories burned during training are calculated?,"Most cardio machines nowadays show an estimate of how many calories you have burned during your training. There are also a lot of different lists available, which activity burns how many calories over a defined period of time.  I wonder if those values include the resting burn rate. Lets assume for simplicity reasons my basal metabolic rate allows me to burn 2400 calories each day or 100 calories each hour. If I sit on my bike for one hour and it shows that I burned 600 calories, are the 100 I would have burned anyway included? Did I burn 3000 or 2900 calories that day?  This is an important question, especially for easy training, lets take walking as example. According to this calculator, one hour of walking burns 245 calories. Lets say I walk a little more than 2 hours, I have burned 500 calories. I might think I should/can eat 500 calories more that day, while I only might have burned 300 more than I would have without walking.  To make a long question short - is the resting burn rate usually included when the calories burned during training are calculated? "
2862,Why does sugar get such a bad rap for being empty calories while other carbs don't?,"What does sugar and alcohol have in common? They are empty calories; offer no nutritional value, so avoid them whenever you can.  Why haven't I heard anyone ever make the same argument about other types of carbs? I understand that a negative effect of sugar is that it causes spikes of insulin levels because of how fast the body can process them, but other than that, they are no different to other types of carbs.  Complex carbs are considered to be healthy because they do not cause insulin spikes, but they are just as empty calories as sugar. Why not avoid complex carbs altogether and get your calories from healthy fats and protein instead? "
2863,Should I slightly posterior tilt my lumbar spine on glute bridges and hip thrusts?,"I am learning glute bridges and hip thrusts. I saw a couple of videos mention that lumbar spine should be slightly posteriorly tilted at glute bridges and hip thrusts. Is this movement pattern safe?   My concern is I have never kept my lower spine in slightly posterior tilt on my main lifts(deadlift, squat). Learning different lower spine movement pattern will affect my main lifts and cause lower spine injury while deadlifting and squatting because I got used to neutral spine.  Here are the videos:  [website][website]"
2864,How do pre workouts provide energy?,"After doing much extensive reading and self learning I've always been under the assumption that the only things that can genuinely give you ""energy"" are macro nutrients since the body can utilize them for energy through the process of gluconeogenesis. And I know that creatine provides a little bit of extra oomph by sparing ATP when you're used up all your stores for the moment.  But what exactly do more pre workouts do that provide energy? A lot of the time people associate words like ""buzz"" and ""jittery"" with them, increased body temperature, among other things. But most of the time there really aren't any direct compounds in them that are responsible for giving you USABLE energy.  If I had to guess I'd say the primary actor in most pre workout energy powders are psychoactive stimulants(such as caffeine and taurine) with dosages multiplied to exponential amounts combined with current trending blends of ""bodybuilding cocktails"" e.g. BCAA's, in essence giving consumers a greatly increased feeling of anxiety. Anxiety in the sense of ""I feel like I ought to do something"" but greatly amplified.  So what do you guys think? "
2865,What is the best way to treat a jammed finger?,"I jammed my ring finger playing keeper in a soccer game last night and it's pretty swollen and discolored. It hurts but I'm pretty sure it's not broken. What is the best way to treat it? Having done this before, I've heard varying recommendations over the years, including    tape it to the next finger wear a splint ice it have someone ""pull"" it out (which scares me to no end!)   Is there anything else I should do? "
2866,Will exercising decrease the heart lifespan?,"I have heard that the heart, as an organ, has a limited number of heartbeats and by doing exercise you will decrease its lifespan.  I know that exercising itself its healthy for the heart but is it better to do less intensive exercises?  Let's say one's bpm is 130 and other's is 150. Will the second person have a smaller heart lifespan? "
2867,Keeping track of muscle dimensions,"I am looking for tools and procedures to keep track of changes in sizes of muscles. (or groups of muscles like upper arms and chest). (1)  How feasible is this? (2)  Are more subjective measures like photos better (3)  Can it be done without considering fatness? (4)  I am planning to measure fat in multiple locations with a caliper, and calculate total body composition at the same time.  Ideally I would like to combine the numbers. "
2868,"Need help for workout, supplement and nutrition","I need some help with my workout routine, supplement guide, and nutrition program.  Current:  Weight: 151 BF: 19.4%  Target:  Weight: 160 BF: 10-12%  Workout:  I have been working out by my self for the last 2 years, mostly working with Kris Gethin's routine. What kind of workout should I follow to achieve good cuts and a six pack. You can see my pic Here. How much cardio do I need to do in a week, and what exercises?  Supplements:  What kind of supplements and protein are good for me for times such as: pre-workout, post workout, and intra-workout? Which one is required to help me make my goal.  Nutrition:  I am vegetarian. What kind of foods should I to avoid and what kind of food is good? How much do I need to eat and how often should I need to eat? Many people say like 8 times a day. Can you suggest me good nutrition plan?  Thank you in advance for help. "
2869,How to maintain calorie with exercise,"I have few doubt about calories. (3 questions)     My measurement : Height 5 feet 11 inches Weight: 75 Kg   Other than at my lower belly, I have not much visible fat in my body. Lets for an example, I limit myself to 1200 calories per day  Do I have to burn > 1200 calories per day to reduce my belly fat? Is it practically possible to loose > 1200 calories per day for about a month or two, shouldn't that can affect my body?  Also, I have started doing    Squat (100 at a time - once in a day ) Rope jumping (75 at a time - twice a day) Pushup (inner, outer, wide = 30 at a time - once in a day) Regular abs exercise (different type of crunches = 40 - once in a day) Normal routine work (like walking for about 10-15 min, working on computer for about 6-7 hours, normal house work for about 20 min per day)   My diet includes   Morning: 1 liter milk (6% fat) with multi grain oats  Lunch: some vegetables and pulses (Indian food) - sum up to 300-400 calories  Afternoon : Apple Night: 1 Apple, 1 Orange, 2 Banana and 1 nutrilite multivitamin and multimineral tablet   I started doing this for a week and I can see a little progress on my upper belly (seems like a part of six pack - which aren't very strange because I don't have much fat over there)  I have seen people has transformed completely in 30-60 days program. What am I missing in my exercise or in my diet?   Also, is it true that more muscle burns more calorie? Like a car with 1000 horse power engine burn more gas than 200 horse power engine.. Do I have to really hit the gym and to do intense workout? "
2870,Tensions of the strength curve,"Influencing the strength curve during a weight training workout.    I have read about the strength curve and the fact that certain exercises for the same muscle have their peak contraction or (hardest moment throughout the movement) at either the begining, middle or end of the strength curve, or on the ascending, bell shaped or descending trajectories respectively.  But most importantly, I've been told that one must seek to train or ""target"" all of the tensions during a session by including exercises that have their peak contraction at each of the 3 main moments explained.  As an example for the Biceps Brachii:  -The exercise ""incline dumbbell curl"" has its peak at the begining of the exercise's ROM (Range Of Motion).  -A regular barbell curl will have this peak at the middle  -Then a ""band Assisted-no money curl"" will have its peak at the end  My questions following this logic are: If necessary to do this at all, then what is the actual benefit of doing so, is targeting all tensions needed for muscle simmetry? required for maximizing strength? Or is it just a way to burn you out faster throughout the workout...  Also since I presented the example of the ""no money curl"" which when assisted with resistance bands changes the peak contraction to the end of the exercise's ROM, can all exercises be modified to alter their peak contraction to another fase of the strenght curve?  Finally, do all exercises follow this diagram's logic, or are there ones that have an equal contraction throughout the whole movement (no peaks at begining, middle or end but equally easy or difficult throughout the ROM)? So this would be like a flat horizontal line on the diagram I'm guessing.  Anyways, hope I sounded clear and I didn't confuse you guys, Thanks. "
2871,Does working out after lunch help to avoid feeling drowsy in the afternoon? Which work out routine is best?,"I work about 40 to 45 hours a week at my office, sitting most of the time. My company allows me to adjust my time table and I can arrange my working hours as I like, as long as the job gets done.   I want to increase my productivity during working hours, so I analyzed my daily productivity curve. Morning is perfect for me, I achieve a lot from 9am until lunch break, which I usually take around 1pm. Afterwards I often feel drowsy and my motivation starts to lack, especially after eating too much. Sometimes this condition lasts for several hours, affecting my productivity more than I like.  The first two changes I want to make to improve this situation is sleeping more during the night and changing my diet to lighter meals for lunch. I am also considering hitting the gym after lunch (it is in the same building as my office) to get fresh energy. Now I need to find out, which kind of training will help me to regain my mental fitness for my work in the afternoon.  Which exercises would be good and how long should I work out? Including a quick shower I do not want to spend more than an hour, but I guess more wouldn't help my cause anyway. Should I start my workout right after I ate or is it better to wait a little? Or is this a bad idea all together and it wouldn't help me to achieve my goal? "
2872,Program Feedback,"My intent was to run a version of 5/3/1 over the school year, as it allows for consistency and not having to worry about how much I need to lift each training session. However, my engineering design class is requiring a butt-ton more time outside of class than I could have predicted which has already impacted my ability to train (I've already pulled 4-5 all-nighters, two of which were consecutive). As it is, my study / course work schedule is inconsistent in both frequency and duration. In other words, I am unable to predict when I will have the actual time to train for my goals, and how much time I'll have for each individual session. The only constraint I have to fulfill is averaging going to the gym 3 times per week to get my health insurance reimbursement. On top of that, I work part-time 2-3 days Friday through Sunday.  In the interim, I've settled on the following 'program' (see below). The overall question is: is this enough?  Sorry in advanced for the length.  Original goals:       Increase maximal strength     Lower body-fat %     Improve conditioning   Current Goals:       At least maintain strength                      Though moving towards my original goals would be preferred.                Lower body-fat %                      I'm less worried about this aspect, as I am still able to effectively control my nutrition.

Heaviest looks like it might be 45-50 lbs.                                           Things that I need / would like to add:                              Chin-ups                                              Smith machines at my gym are too low, cable machines only offer grips for pull-ups or neutral-grip pull-ups, and dip stations provide a grip that's greater than shoulder-width (plus the knurling eats my hands).                                      Conventional, deficit, stiff-legged, and snatch-grip deadlifts (I love deadlifts, lol)                 Paused rep work for squats and deadlifts                 Pin squats and rack pulls                 Clean and snatch pulls                     Days with the highest priority are the squat, deadlift, and press days. I'm not a powerlifter, so benching is less important for my goals (plus I have a history of shoulder injuries, so less frequent benching isn't horrible [and frankly, I'm just not the biggest fan of it]).  Subsequent questions would involve: Should I add anything in particular? Should anything be removed? Is the program organized well enough as is, or can that be improved? Is this type of program better off performed whenever I can fit it in, or when I currently do it, which is first thing in the morning (I wake up at ~5:30 am almost every day, school work permitting)?  Edit: I'm still looking for more feedback from a possibly different perspective / or that address the subsequent questions. "
2873,Beginner runner - severe shin pain,"I started with the treadmill a few weeks ago and every time I run the muscle to the outside of my shin (Tibialis anterior?) becomes extremely tight, rock solid, and painful after only 5 minutes. This has been happening since day 1. I have to stop as soon as that happens due to the pain, which is quite discouraging  Are these shin splints? I've read that shin splints typically occur on the inside of the shin, not the outside. Additionally, I've read that it typically takes a while for shin splints to occur (rather than from day 1 like in my case)  I presume there are exercises for shin splints, so my main question is actually, is it normal for this type of pain to occur after only 5 minutes of slow jogging? That onset seems quite acute and hasnt improved in the past few weeks  Some additional information that may be relevant:   I always warm up with a slow walk and work up to a run, so I don't think this is because I'm jumping directly into running I have extremely flat feet so I purchased a new pair of running shoes with a fair amount of support due to recommendations from the guy at the running store. I've been wearing these since day 1 I'm quite overweight for my height: 5'7"" and 175lbs I haven't done any real exercise for a little over a decade, but I feel like my body should be able to handle just 5 minutes of running...  "
2874,Is it normal to have a belly when I relax?,"This is what I look like if I flex:   But if I relax, my belly actually sticks out quite a bit:   Is this normal? Should I try to lose some fat?  EDIT: admittedly in the second picture I was purposely slouching in order to enhance the effect. Here's a picture I've just taken in which I'm standing as I normally would.  Visceral fat is extremely unhealthy, as far as I've read, so that's what I'm asking about.   "
2875,How to convert difference in elevation into distance?,"When you're running up a slope, you're running slower. Down the hill you may run faster, if your knees allow it. But how much?  In German, there is the notion of ""Leistungskilometer"", which is translated to ""effective kilometers"", ""technical kilometers"", ""power kilometers"" or ""energy expenditure kilometers"", depending on the source. The definition is that 100m difference in elevation are equivalent to 1 flat kilometer, at least for calculating hiking times.  I find that for running this is not true. Using a factor of 10 for the difference in elevation gives me virtual flat paces that are way beyond my abilities. Say you're running 6 km up a 500m hill in 45 minutes. This is a pace of 7:30; with a factor 10 the flat equivalent would 6 + 10x0.5 = 11 kilometers, giving a pace of 4:05.  I think a pace of 5:18 (which is using a factor of 5) would be more realistic.  Are there common conventions how to account for slopes when running? "
2876,Getting blister-y feet after long evening walks,"Since the New Year, I've been doing 2-3 hours walk every night, while eating less.  People remark that I look like I'm 30 lbs lighter now in April.  I feel good but not that good ...  My question is: all this walking gives me painful feet, namely blisters, dead skin, dried blood.    I've switched shoes 3 times now and am currently wearing Adidas Superstars which are supposedly wider and more comfortable -- but the problems persist.  Should I get insoles?  Which kind would be good to handle the long walks? "

2878,Snapping hip syndrome and running,"I'm into week 7 of couch25k program. For a while now (years) I have what appears to be Snapping Hip Syndrome. My hip is fine 90% of the time, but there's always an exact motion I can make to make it pop quite loud. That's ok with me, but after a run, it hurts a bit and it can be uncomfortable to sit and walk.   Is there anything I can do to make it any better other than rest? Do some stretches, cool it with an ice pack or something else? "
2879,Why are running records not set when running barefoot?,"When running records are set in areas with controlled conditions (e.g. nothing on the ground that could cause problems if barefoot), the runners still wear shoes.  It seems a curious idea that you run faster with shoes on than without, given the increase in weight on your feet.    – The theoretical  part of the question: Is there any evidence that running in lightweight shoes is faster than running barefoot?  – The practical part of the question: Why are (seemingly) no running records set with people running barefoot?  Please provide links to evidence.  "
2880,5000 Calories to build muscle? Or to bulk?,"I'm 14 (think it's important for this question) and I love gym (safe way, no crazy weights). I read a lot about it and I pass through various articles saying that if you want to increase gains you need to eat like 5000 calories. First of all, I wonder if that is just to bulk as fast as you can then to cut, or is it to consistently build muscle without gaining a lot of fat?  I know I'm growing, meaning that I need more food and protein (2700 calories without working out; I always work out different muscles every day). And I looked up on the Internet and it seems like a lifting session takes about 400 calories, and adding that I have a crazy thing for doing random push-ups:  Do I need to eat around 3500 - 4000 to grow muscle and still continue growing in size (height)?  I don't have problem with proteins because it is easy to eat around 80 grams of protein a day, although I don't know how I am going to keep it natural when growing up. As for macro nutrients, which I understand are fat, carbohydrates and protein, I take them specially in a bread called ""semas"", 8 grams of fat, 8 grams of protein and about 350 calories (totally recommended if they sell them out of Mexico (lol)).   I know I won't grow crazy muscle, but it is good to see how definition, strength and size go up. "
2881,Potential side effects of Alli & other 'weight aid' pills,"In short:  I stepped on the scales, discovered I've gained a lot these past 3 months after starting new job and went into an alcohol induced depression that results in the purchase of many tabs to try and aid in my new regime.  I have a wedding in a year and I need to shift the excess by any means necessary, even to the point on contact a surgeon.  Unfortunatley the voice of reason and common sense is being dwarfed by the need and desire to shed this excess.  I spend 12 hours of my day sitting, when I return home I lack the energy to do anything other than carry on sitting. I'm breaking this pattern by gym during lunch break and moderating my eating habits however, my question is really this:  I'm now consuming several tablets per day as an aid, today I noticed one of the side effects of 'Alli' when attending to business, it wasn't pleasant but I'm prepared to put up with it.  The combination of tabs is:  Cod Liver Oil x1 in the morning HTP-5 x1 in the morning. Grenade Black ops x2 in the morning ([website]Alli x3 per day with meals. ([website]Garcinea x3 with meals ([website]Sea Kelp x 3 with meals ([website]Besides this being a cocktail, are there any other potential issues that I should worry about?  Thanks for your time. "
2882,Are there any specific exercises that can reduce pain from kneeling?,"I know this question is the perfect setup for innuendo-laden comments, but it is a serious question, so please limit responses accordingly.  There are at least a few activities where my natural inclination may be to kneel (e.g. sitting on the floor to play with my nieces/nephews, rotating tires on my car, working on appliances).  It seems like children can sit on their knees all day long. However, any time I have seen anyone over the age of 20 get up from kneeling to talk/play with children on the floor (myself included), they say ""I'm not as young as I used to be"" implying some degree of stiffness/knee pain.  Short of knee pads, is there an exercise or activity that can done to significantly improve the ability to kneel for extended periods of time without pain? Or, is this really just an unnatural position for humans that requires additional padding? "
2883,How does wiggling your fingers activate your fast twitch muscle fibers?,"You may remember hurdler Michelle Jenneke's famous dance where she wiggles her fingers to warm up before the race. In this interview (at 01:11), she reveals that wiggling her fingers activates her fast twitch fibers. Is this scientifically valid? And if so, why do your legs become more explosive from movements in your fingers?  "
2884,How do marathons work?,"So I am a newbie athlete, I have only ran half a marathon, and on a treadmill. I am very keen on running a full marathon, but I wanted to learn about it from professionals first. If you google ""marathon world record"", you will see Dennis Kimetto of Kenya holds the record of 2 hours and 2 minutes. This arises a few questions-   How do athletes track their running pace while they are running? Where do these athletes make their records? Indoors, Outdoors, Track or Cross country? How do they Not run out of water? Do they wear those inconvenient fuel belts which can barely hold a few sips?  "
2885,Is running 20km or more each weekend too much?,"I'm preparing for running a 30 km road race (18/19 miles) in two months.  For the moment I have achieved 21 km, twice last year and once this year (last week end).  I have been advised not to increase the running distance more than 10% each for each long run ( each week end for me). That means I plan something like running 22km, 24km, 26km, 28km, 30km, in the next week ends.  I wonder if is it considered harmfull to run a half-marathon each week end ? Does it make the possibility of injury higher ? Is it irresponsible for a training plan ?  Beside, during the working week, I run 3 times, 5 km. "
2886,What happens when you miss a workout?,"Normally I get to the gym Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays and try to lift a little bit more weight than I did the time before.  Today everything has gone wrong and I am not going to be able to make it to the gym.  Biologically speaking what is happening to me now?  Are my muscles shrinking rapidly and my skeleton imploding completely trashing any hopes I have of lifting again? Or is it fairly harmless and my muscles will stay the same and may even benefit from the extra rest?  How many times would I have to miss working out before it starting to seriously set my progress back? "
2887,Brachial plexus compression: What to do and what to avoid?,"I got diagnosed with brachial plexus compression (basically the pectoralis compresses the nerves going to the arm at the brachial plexus, which entraps them at that point). Unfortunatly the only thing the doc could say, was to take it easy when working out and wait. It'll go away on itself over time.  Are there any exercises I should avoid at all now? What can I do to easy the situation? "
2888,What is the best pre-workout supplement for long distance running?,"I recently came across a blog post called the Top 10 Rated Pre Workout Supplements of 2011, which compares a bunch of concoctions made of ""stimulants, nitric oxide, creatine, and amino acids."" There are several questions floating around Fitness &amp; Nutrition about the best things to eat before a workout and even before jogging, but they don't really address pre-workout supplements. Is that because supplements aren't effective? If they are, which one is most effective for fueling a long run? "
2889,"Compound, total body exercises minimising quad and ham development","I'm currently squatting twice a week, deadlifting once.  Deadlifting doesn't concern me because I feel my back is getting a great workout and the hips are starting much higher than the knees, but squatting I'm fearing too much of a leg workout. My legs are already way too big compared to the rest of my body and more than capable strength-wise for everyday activities.  In fact I'm sort of glad I'm up around 20-22% body fat now, as when I was 15% my legs looked just too muscley for my liking. I'm not into the bodybuilder look.  I'm squatting bodyweight (100kg/220lbs) currently, not much by any means, but I've just started training (5 weeks) and it's jumping up 10kg(22lbs)/week, with 2x5, 1x5+ worksets. I feel I have quite a way until I start stalling.  By comparison, my work weight on the bench is only 60kg/132lbs, shoulder press 48kg/105lbs and they're not shooting up with double increments like the squats/deadlifts, rather 1.25kg/2.5lbs per workout at best, sometimes failing to complete the final set. I'm up to 80kg/176lbs on v-grip pulldowns and doing lots of chin negs as I can't yet do a single chin-up!  I'm doing the squat as recommended in Starting Strength/Stronglifts. Does an alternate form minimising quad and hamstring development exist?   Might it be preferable to substitute in power cleans for one of the squat workouts?   Or are there other really good total body exercises not primarily working legs? "
2890,"After a successful 3 month training, what could it be that made my legs refuse to finish a marathon?","I failed a marathon at 40km recently due to pain in the left knee and pain in the muscle of the right leg, what I believe could be the Vastus Medialis Obliquus according to the picture.  Here you can see the process of the marathon. You can see that it was a rather slow and steady decline after the first 21km or so.  I did a 12 weeks training plan successfully and without any health issues; see the training plan; it is from Runner's World and I used it successfully before (though it was for a marathon under 4h). The max. heart frequency I used for the training plas was 190 beats per minute.  You can also see the statistics and from there the workouts.  I could have walked slowly till the end, but the gates closed after 4h. So it did not make any sense for me to continue with the pain.  My question is what could be the reason?   The course had some (slow but rather longer) slopes, whilst I trained on a rather flat course. Does this make a difference? Does this make sense? I have issues with my left knee. Though I trained well and had no issues whatsoever during the training. During the run I only had water every 5km and a fruit bar. No special food or energy gels were taken or provided. The days before the food was mostly rice, noodles and meat. Porridge for breakfast on the day of the run. I used the running shoes that I trained with during the whole time. I had no respiratory problems nor did I feel exhausted. I was feeling very fit. That is the part that wonders me most. I felt fit, but my legs refused service? I trained in Málaga, Spain. The marathon was in Pyongyang, North Korea.   I try to understand my situation, but my thoughts so far are not really satisfying. I hope to find hints or answers here. Please share this question with anyone you may think could help. "
2891,How can I avoid hurting my wrists when using the bar while playing DDR?,"I play Dance Dance Revolution and similar games to exercise. On especially difficult levels, I lean back and grab the bar behind me, putting some of my weight on it and on my arms and wrists, to be able to move more quickly while expending less energy. After having done this for a few weeks, my wrists are starting to ache.  This is what it looks like when I use the bar: [website]There are three ways I believe using the bar stresses my wrists:   Of course, putting much of my weight on my arm for a couple minutes at a time while moving around a lot probably strains my wrists, especially if my wrists are bent backwards like in the video. I often switch from holding the bar to not using it in the middle of a song. In order to avoid disrupting my combo while transitioning, I push myself off the bar with my arms so I get off of it as quickly as possible. I've noticed that this often hurts my wrists a little more intensely as I transition. Likewise, when I first grab the bar in the middle of a song, I usually try to grab it as quickly as possible and might be dropping all of my weight right onto my wrists during the transition.   How can I use the bar and still transition onto and off of it quickly during play without damaging my wrists? Is there a certain posture I should be using or a particular way I should be positioning my weight on my wrists? Are there exercises I can do to increase my wrist strength so that they're less likely to be injured? "
2892,Grip and resistance band placement on resistance band front squat for injury prevention,I am trying to figure out what is the safest resistance band placement on front squats. Here is the how I place resistance bands on front squat:   I am thinking about placing the resistance bands on the anterior portion of the shoulder and allow the force of the resistance band sit on my shoulders. I will use a classic front rack grip(clean grip) like that: [website]Note: I am not trying to reinvent the wheel but details about form and resistance band placement important for me because I will progress bands between 200-400 lbs(currently doing 240 lbs with this form) and I want to make sure I am doing everything right for injury prevention. I am new for resistance bands and open for new advice for safety concerns.  Cross arm grip seems a little bit safer than the clean grip on resistance bands because it spread the force of resistance band better. Here is the video demonstrating the cross arm grip on resistance band front squat.[website]
2893,What is a good and tested body building programs for a beginner?,"What would be a good body building program for a beginner? I have been searching the Internet and find a lot of programs but am not sure about the credibility of the people who have published these programs. For example, in the world of strength training, StrongLifts, Starting strength, and Bill Starr are all famous and very credible programs. What could be their equivalent in bodybuilding?   I am looking for reputable Programs that have passed the test of time and have been designed by reputable coaches. If the coach is maintaining a forum for the same that is even more welcome. Please do not post a program that works/worked for you. The Program should also be a beginner program which can explain gains for novice bodybuilders and be totally steroid free. "
2894,What is excreted in diarrhea?,"When you have diarrhea, what portions of the food is excreted? Does only the poisoned portions become excreted or do the whole stomach contents get excreted?  Here is a practical example: For your post workout shake, you blend whey protein with milk. You did not know the milk was expired. After drinking the shake, you get a stomach ache and have diarrhea. What exactly was excreted in the diarhea? Did only the milk get excreted and not the whey? Or did both get excreted? In the latter case, one would need to eat more protein, but in the former case, you don't need to worry because the protein is still in your system. "
2895,How is muscle repair affected by a caloric deficit?,"Background  Weightlifting creates micro-tears in the muscle. Protein and other nutrients repair the tears so the muscle grows back stronger and larger.  Question  How is muscle repair affected by a caloric deficit during a weight training program? I can think of these three scenarios:   Muscle still has the potential to grow back stronger and bigger, but at a much slower rate. It patiently waits for what little nutrients come in day after day. Muscle remains the same - there is equilibrium. Muscle senses it does not have proper nutrients and gives up. It does not completely repair and becomes smaller and weaker.   Which one is correct? Or is there a different scenario that happens?  Application  I'm trying to lose fat by eating less (including protein). I still exercise every day. I enjoy weightlifting, but hate cardio. Will my muscularity be compromised because of this combination of weightlifting and eating less? "
2896,Why do bodybuilders take such a long recovery period?,"Why do bodybuilders take recovery periods that are longer than any other type of athlete?   Im doing a mixture of weights and cardio. I try to do 2 sessions with weights focusing on upper body and 2 cario sessions (with some high resistant) a week. If I do weights on monday and I want to do cardio to tuesday, should I avoid the rowing machine?     "
2897,What's the importance of cardio in bulking phase?,"I know that cardio exercises are really important to fat burn and heart health.  But, for a amateur bodybuilder in bulking phase, cardio are really necessary?   What's the importance of doing it?  Will cardio disturb my gains?  Thanks! "
2898,What is Max and average summary mean?,"After finishing a ""challenge"" the matrix rower shows you a Max and average summary:   What is the difference? I don't get what the context is here.

What is the diff between calories under average and max summary? "
2899,Physical Fitness standards for 19 year old male?,"and thanks in advance for your help. I've been weightlifting a few months, and I'm wondering just how far below my my strength is.  I am a 19 year old male. My questions are: What should a reasonably fit man of my age(not sick, not overweight or otherwise disadvantaged) be able to lift? General standards such as bench presses, number of chinups that can be done, weight that can be bicep curled, etcetera.  Is there a somewhat widely accepted physical fitness test to measure myself against? Maybe an army test or something?  What should a somewhat athletic person of my age and height be able to lift? My height is about 5'4"" and my weight is around 130 pounds.  I weightlift once every two days, upper body only, and very low weights and few reps. I am, as said above, relatively small, and weightlifting is my only exercise. As such, how many calories should I attempt to eat every day? "
2900,Is this an optimal plan for strength and cardio?," I’m a 33 year old male.  5’11. 156 pounds. I'm approx 14% bodyfat.    I’m looking to get ‘fit’. I’ve worked out (5km-half marathon, swimming, squat, bench) at various times in my life and tracked calories, macros etc.  Current Stats Have not worked out in a few years.  Cardio   Can run 5km in about 23 mins Can do half marathon in around 2hrs   Strength (have not lifted in a few years) - 1 rep max   Prob Bench around 100 pounds Prob Squat around 100 pounds (squat has always been relatively weak compared to bench)   I’ve lifted weights before, including squats and bench. I’ve got the starting strength book.  Goals  In general I’m looking to improve functional strength and cardio. I’m not looking to be able to lift really heavy in gym. Or put on a ton of size. I’d prefer to optimize first for cardio, then for aesthetics, then for strength, In order of priority:   I’d like to get to 9% bodyfat I’d like to run a 5km in sub 20mins Swim: Not sure, but I’d like to    increase swim performance I’d like to increase my strength to Bench:150lbs [website]Squat:    200lbs [website]I’d like to put on 5-10 pounds of muscle - but most of all I’m optimizing for body fat loss, while increasing strength to novice-ish levels.

2901,Fixed weight exercise - effects over time (going from low to high reps)?,"In addition to the core barbell exercises (in a 5x5 programme) I sometimes add dips and chin-ups at the end of the workout. However, these are always at bodyweight (I don't have a belt/chains).  Transfering this situation into a more generic question: if I keep doing the same exercise at roughly the same weight, what are the long term effects?   The first phase will be gaining strength (getting to, let's say, 3x5 or 5x5)? If you keep doing 5x5, eventually you will get stronger and be able to pull 3x8 or more? When reaching 3x10 or 3x12, will the exercise yield more muscle mass then it did so far? If 3x12 gets easy and let's say 3x20 is performed: what will the effects be on the muscle mass (and strength) gained so far?   Is this the way those ""street calisthenics"" specialists achieve that combination of muscle mass, tension and endurance? "
2902,200 situps in combination with 100 pushups 6 week program?,"For those off you that know about the 200 sit up and 100 push ups program, would it be a good idea to combine the two programs in one? The program works by dividing the workout into 3 times a week, with a day of rest between each. I'm thinking of doing the following: Monday, Wed, Fri: Push ups Tues, Thurs, Sat: Sit ups    going by their plan, I should be able to finish both programs in about 6 weeks.   Is this efficient? Or will one of the program hinder the other? "

2904,Workout t-shirts and types of fabric,"I have been working out in the same t-shirts I normally use, recognised that's a mistake, the washing machine dont remove the odors completely, still some left after rinsing once with vinegar.  What should i look for in workout t-shirts and fabrics? I do bodyweight training, running and some machines at a gym. Merino wool, cotton, bamboo, synthetics?  Whatever they sell in a sports store?  Cheap cottonshirts from clothing stores? "
2905,How to compensate for extended cardio as body builder,"I'm am doing body building as a hobby with 4 training sessions a week lasting for 60 to 90 minutes. I had good results with an intake of around 3.500 calories per day, the usual low carb diet. My goal is to build lean muscles.  I started to play a game called Ingress a while ago, which requires to travel around town a lot and the fastest way for me is doing this on inline skates. Such an Ingress session can take really long, sometimes more than 6 hours constantly skating around. I mostly play on my off-days, but sometimes even some hours before or after the gym.  As the summer approaches, especially when I am on vacation and have even more time to spare, I expect these sessions to expand further.  Currently I do not see any negative impact on my body building progress, but I guess sooner or later those extended cardio sessions will lead to exhaustion or cut too much into my energy reserves which will decrease my potential for muscle growth.  How should I compensate for this? I don't want to reduce my Ingress playing time but I also want to progress with body building. Is it enough to add more calories to my diet to compensate for the calories burned during cardio? Which types of food are recommended for this? And do I also need to increase the amount of sleep I get if I don't feel tired during the day? "
2906,Why shouldn't you drink your protein shakes before or during a training session?,"It seems to be common knowledge that you should consume your protein shake right after a training session for best effect. The sooner the better. I wonder why you shouldn't consume your shake right before the training or during training? It takes some time for the body to process the protein anyway, therefore it seems to make more sense to consume it sooner.  Would the body use the expensive protein as simple energy source and waste it or is the answer more complex? "
2907,How to avoid toe injury in martial arts?,How do I prevent injuries in my toes while kickboxing? Specially the big toe and the small one?  I have heard about taping but is there a strengthening exercise to prevent injury or such? If you suggest taping I'd like to know specifically how. 
2908,Pseudo - High Gravity Training,"I was wondering if wearing weights during your daily life work as a pseudo-high gravity training.   Consider, I wear leg weights, weights on my back and arms, and wear them throughout the day (not while sleeping, since it would be uncomfortable).   Now after a few months the weights seem to have become a normal part of my body, so I remove the weights now I guess I would feel very light similar to how it would feel when going to a place with a less gravity than the Earth.  Now, is my assumption correct? Or there is something I am unaware of? "
2909,Do short Achilles tendons disturb my squatting?,"I have trouble maintaining proper form while performing below-parallel squats: I can't bring my knees forward enough without lifting my heels from the ground. My trainer claims that this is caused by my Achilles tendons being too short because I run a lot.  However, I was under the impression that tendon length doesn't adapt to the environment.   Could short Achilles tendons be the problem here? How to fix it as quickly as possible (without surgery)?   "
2910,"Gyming does not add bulk to my body, it only puts my body into good shape","I am a 23 year old, 5 foot 5 inches tall, 52 kg male. Judging by my BMI, I'm not underweight, but I still look skinny. I am not weak (I think) as I can do 60 push ups (20-20-20), 10-12 pulls ups and some basic exercises to a good extent.   I have tried gyming, but that only results in my body getting into good shape (great shape in fact). The gym results are visible on my body faster than any one of my friends. But only the shape, not the mass or bulk. Am I an ectomorph? Does that have anything to do with the metabolism of my body?  I want to ask how to add bulk to my body, don't tell me to eat a lot because I'm doing that and there is no visible effect of that on my body. Any help will be appreciated. "
2911,What is starvation mode?,"I lift weights but sometimes I'm so tired I forget to take dinner because I end up asleep in bed after showering, then I go without eating until next day's lunch time. And I feel light headed before eating and all round slower when moving. Is this starvation mode?  And is it true that whatever I eat after this will be stored as fat in the body? "
2912,How to grow muscle while burning fat?,"I am not obese, nor overweight but I still have fat accumulated around the waistline(giving me those ugly love handles). Other than that, I don't have much fat on me. I have tried long cardio sessions(cutting out on weights) just to notice that I get uniformly ""thinner"" and the waist is still protruding. Then, OTOH, stressing on weights to get ""big"" actually neglects the abdominal region. Is there a way to get ""big"" (with muscle, of course) and simultaneously get rid of that fat? I mean the kind of diet I'd be on during muscle building - does it necessarily have to inhibit fat loss at the waist? I read a similar question but that is not exactly what I'm talking about, besides being overly technical.  Thanks. "
2913,Depreciating repetition after each set,"I am doing jump lunges as one of my exercise(. I read online that you should be able to do 8-12 reps in 4-5 sets with 45-60 sec rest in between. In the first set I was able to complete 12 jump lunges(excruciating pain), the second set I went down drastically to 5 and after that to 3 and after that my legs just give out when I attempt another jump. Maybe I am doing it wrong somehow or maybe I am just too weak. Does each side of the leg count as one rep or is it after completing both legs does it start to count as one rep?  Side note this also happens when I do push ups 28 reps per set   Are there any solution to this and how do i keep training when I keep failing after the 2-3 sets? "
2914,Precautions for difficulty faced on first day of gym,"This was quite bad day today in the gym and that too my first day. I vomited after doing just 20 sit ups in the final session of the day.    I'm newbie in fitness and don't know too much terms and i don't exercised previously. I am programmer by profession.    I did few lifts, presses, push ups, pull ups, stretching. Which affected nothing to me apart from little muscle pain due reason being first day in gym i believe. I had done gym 4years back for only 4months approx. Now i thought to start again.    Exercise followed: In weight based: 3 sets with increasing weight by one slab. Like as below 1st set: 15kg 15times 2nd set: 30-40kg 12times 3rd set: same or more 10times  In other: 20times Like 20 Sit ups or stretching variations.    As i was exhausted after almost 50 min of exercises, i asked trainer to leave and he instructed me to do last two things, 20 sit ups and hand crunches (for fist strengthening) but after doing sit ups my body started weird feeling. I felt faints and un easy breathing. After few minutes of rest i felt like vomit and after vomiting all was well.    In vomit, it was water and few food particles from dinner yesterday.    My question are:  1. Why it happened after sit ups only?  2. What precaution i must take so if my trainer is going wrong i can prevent hurting myself? "
2915,How Good is a Hand Cycle,I've injured my knee a bit and it has taken me off my bike for a little while.  Someone suggested using a hand cycle at the gym to keep up cardio and calorie burning.  How good is a hand cycle for that?  Is there something that is better? 
2916,What happens when someone does too many crunches?,"If someone basically only do crunches (or other exercises with a similar contraction) for his abs (many people seem to be in this group), what would be the result? Would this be unhealthy? Should I complement them with other exercises? "

2918,Is it better to keep a fixed bed time or waking up time?,"As we all know the best is to have fixed bed time and fixed waking up time in order not to feel tired. However life does not always allow this.  If you need to reduce your sleeping time (or at the opposite increase your sleep time during the weekend in order to catch up) is it better to shift the time your going to bed or the waking up time ? Is one of the two options better in handling these variation of sleeping time or does it make no difference ?  Edit : This question is asked because I have intensive sport trainings (dance+gym(acrobatics)) at fixed time several days and I have to work a given amount of hours (amount which can vary) for my job but I'm free to adjust my timetable (bed/waking up time) as long as I do my job hours. That's why I'm asking when I have a variation of working hour, is one of the two option better in order to be the less tired for sport training. (However it's true that it may also be applied in general outside of Physical Fitness so maybe it's off topic) "
2919,What are the pros and cons of slow cuts versus fast cuts?,"My Background  I completed a 4 month long clean bulk a couple of weeks ago. Over those 4 months I put on 10lbs and my lifts went up significantly. I followed a keto-paleo diet (unconventional for bulking I know) and 6 day push, pull, legs split.     Now I want to start a cut to lean out, while still preserving as much muscle mass and strength as possible. Based on my background and goals, should I do a slow cut (200-300 calorie deficit daily) or a fast cut (1000+ calories)? And why? "
2920,daily upper body weightlifting?,"What is a good upper body weightlifting routine that I could do daily to gain muscle without leaving a day for rest in between? How can I split upper body exercises in 2 halves so that I let the rest of the upper body rest in between?  Background: I would like to do a weightlifting daily workout session over holidays (2 weeks) on a well-equipped gym, so I would like to have my weightlifting sessions fit in so that I can do as much as possible. During the year, I only do maintenance weightlifting twice per week, and the rest is x-trainer and running. "
2921,The Push-up Push Workout,"According to Military.com, a source that I actually trust, a good start would be a routine of 200 push-ups/a day (for people who, like me, can't perform more than 50 push-ups).  More exactly: in odd days, 200 pushups in as few sets as possible. In even days, 200 pushups throughout the day.  Isn't this way too much? Isn't that already slipping into the unhealthy territory and it's a recipe for lesions? "
2922,What's the opposite exercise to the squat?,Is there a good bodyweight antagonist exercise to the squat? In the same way the push up has the pull up or the inverted row? 
2923,Dumbbell Weights: Diameter vs Width,"I wonder how to add more weight to a dumbbell. Adding more plates of fewer weight or fewer plates of higher weight?  With bigger plates the diameter grows and so will the minimum distance the dumbbells will have to your body. With more plates on the handle however the center of the handle itself will be farther away from the body - eg. when placing the plates on the shoulders while doing front squats - and it might be harder to balance the dumbbell as the weight is farther away from the center as well.  I already bought rubberized cast iron plates, not those concrete filled plastic plates, as reviews on amazon complained about the overall size of the latter.  Do I have to worry about this at all when buying weights for my dumbbells?  As per request I drew a diagram:    Imagine this to be the resting position of the dumbbell on the shoulder when doing a front squat, viewed from the front. The brown line below the dumbbell resembles the shoulder, the brown block is the hand. The plates are on the shoulder, the handle itself goes down behind the back. With only one plate the hand is closer to the shoulder (red line), this also affects the angle of the elbow. However the hand is farther away from the head (blue line). With the three smaller plates the hand is higher up, but the dumbbell can be held closer to the head. "
2924,Exercises for strengthening foot twisting,"I have not found anything on this.  I want to strengthen muscles which help rotate the ski (i.e. point the skis left or right - for snow-plough turns and so on)   What exercises would be best for this? Preferably just using bodyweight.  I assume the usual of 20-30 reps, but how often?    I was thinking perhaps standing on one leg, and rotating my body left and right, but it sounds like it's asking for an injury!!   In case it matters, the reason I need this is when I had my last (beginners') ski lesson (3 hours) I just didn't have the strength to do snowploughing. I wasn't aching afterwards though which is weird. "
2925,What would cause a sudden drop in motivation and workout avoidance?,"A little bit of background which might help in appraising the situation. If you want to avoid the fluff, the actual concrete question in bold at the bottom.  Up until the start of April this year I've done a linear progression using more or less the Starting Strength model, with some of the typical shenanigans that Mark Rippetoe would not approve of. No powercleans (I can't for the life of me get into the rack position, not that interested in explosive power), added rows. Prior to that I had already done 1.5 years of strength training with very mediocre results, mostly due to a fear of regaining fat and not eating through plateaus. This time I ate like I meant it and the 6 month progress was better than everything before then. I wouldn't say it was a waste experience-wise, though.  Now the time has come to lose some of that excess fat, so since the start of April I've introduced a caloric deficit. I'm lowering the calories from week to week rather than directly plummeting to some bottom value, since this is easier to maintain for the planned 12-or-so weeks and seems to avoid the typical weight loss stalls. Regardless of whether I'm right, it seems to work and losing weight is currently easy.  Unfortunately, for the past few weeks my motivation to do my workouts has taken a nosedive. I find myself making mental excuses, such as ""I'll go to sleep early and get more time for it tomorrow"" or go to check some Stack Overflow questions on my laptop and stick around until it seems too late to still go to the gym. I've maintained a rather consistent gym discipline for two years, apart from the occasional bad week, and usually enjoyed my workouts despite self-doubt and grinding through some exercises. So I'm not sure why things have taken this turn.  Some reasons I can think of:   I've had a clear goal for half a year (get stronger no matter what) and now that this goal shifts (lose weight, maintain strength) I'm a bit directionless. I'm anxious about a workout going ""badly"" compared to previous ones because some loss of strength is inevitable with a caloric deficit. I've grown tired of doing the same workouts and exercises (squat, deadlift, bench, overhead press, rows, chin-ups) all the time. The idea of squatting 3 times a week and every time having to give it my best down to the last rep has burned me out (me and the squat aren't on the best terms).   If after a prolonged and successful period of working out there's a sudden lack of desire to continue, what is likely the most important factor? What change would turn things around? "
2926,Understanding physical fitness anatomically,"   Possible Duplicate:   What are good books on muscle building heavily based on science?       Are there any books which explain the significance of each and every exercise we do in the gym? I do not mean one of those ""guides to fitness"" I'd rather like a book describing physical fitness from a human anatomy point of view. So that before we work out, we know exactly what is going to happen inside the body, inside the muscles and where and how much wear and tear happens when we do a workout and how to maintain a diet to compensate for that wear and tear? Basically a scientific/medical approach to physical fitness. The sort of workout an orthopedic/sports doctor would tell you to do rather than a fitness trainer. "
2927,How can I diagnose my running and postural issues?,"Introduction: I run a 1.8 mile loop around my neighborhood every morning before class or work.  A few years ago, I got sciatica and missed the entire school soccer season.  The pain was on my right side lower back, and shot down my left leg.  Occasionally the pain would reach the base of my skull.  Physical therapy sessions and stretches relieved my pain.  Ever since then I feel that I am running improperly.  Problem:  First of my problems is, while running, my right leg gets tired before my left.  The calf and quad muscles don't ache, but that feeling of getting a good workout.  While my left leg I feel no sensation of being tired at all.  I feel like one side of my body is being worked out better than the other.  Could this be cause my bad posture while running? (i.e Leaning to one side, slouching, or having my torso twisted in one direction)  Or, would having one leg longer than the other cause this?  Because I get the feeling my legs are two different lengths during specific activities. Secondly, when my right leg hits the ground, it hits hard.  It's not as smooth and as low impact as the left leg.  I have tried running on my toes, but it's the same.  And my calf on my right leg still feels the workout first.  I have tried slowing down and running heal-to-toe.  Same issue.  Could this be caused by any of the issues listed above? Also, in the car, I can not get comfortable.  When I look down, my nose does not light up with my bellybutton.  It is always lined up just to the left of it.  During long car rides, slowly pain starts to creep from my right buttock to my right lower back.  Question:  Can anyone at least identify with this?  What kind of running shoe insoles should I get to correct these issues?  Or do I have to have a doctor check me out for skeletal problems?  Thanks for your help in advance. "
2928,Uneven chest after pushups,"This happened last year that when I used to do pushups, I realized my chest got uneven, and its more than just a bit but still only noticeable to me.  I do wrist pushups properly but don't understand how my chest got uneven. Is it because I might be doing more work with my right hand unknowingly like my right hand is doing more work in pushing myself up?  How can I make sure it doesn't get worse than this? And how can I make it approximately even?  P.S. It can also be the case that my chest was uneven before and I just realized the unevenness after it got more noticeable after pushups. "
2929,how many days it will take to get pain away?,"I have joined the gym yesterday as a beginner. In the gym, what they asked me to with machines I have done. From that moment my joints and neck are getting sore and today this pain increased. So my question is when this pain will go away? Does this take forever or some days? Today is my leg day so I guess my legs will get sore today too :(  I have never done such physical activity, except dance, it does create soreness in the body for one day only So I have no idea of this soreness.

2930,Why is it common for doctors / trainers / physical therapists to advise clients against doing valsalva (either partial or full) when lifting?,"Are these folks taught in school (or as part of their licensing process) that valsalva is unsafe?  Do they advise against it for liability reasons? (e.g., they're more likely to face a lawsuit from a client/patient who performed valsalva and ended up experiencing a rare blood-pressure related issue vs. a client/patient who didn't perform valsalva and ended up hurting their back?)  Am curious why there is such a big disconnect between advice from professionals vs. advice from the vast majority of serious lifters? "
2931,Supercompensation and split workouts,I'm an amateur weight lifter. For the past few years have doing a 3 day split workouts. Squat/Deadlift/BenchPress + support. I recently got introduced to the concept of supercompensation and seems to me like a biological effect that should be considered in a effective workout.   Does a 3 day split workout set take advantage of Supercompensation? Each muscle group is being trained only once a week. Should one squat/deadlift/bench 3 times a week?  Thanks for your input.  
2932,Do I need to lose more weight ? My BMI is 21.5,"My age is 22 from Pakistan, my weight is 125 lbs (56.7 kg) and have a height of 5ft and 4in (1.62 m), so do I need to lose some weight?  As far history I have lose about 18lbs in two months, my actual weight was 143 lbs (64 kg). So should I lose some more weight or its enough ? "
2933,How long should I be able to stay in HR zone 5?,"I'm a very fit triathlete one month away from my first Ironman.  I'm strictly following Don Fink's training plan, which includes ""interval training"" in HR zone 5, or 90%+ max HR.  (Fink actually calls it ""zone 4"" for some reason.)  The workouts used to involve more traditional intervals: bring your HR up to 90% for a few minutes, then rest, then repeat.  But at this point in his plan - at the peak of the ""peak phase"" - he's asking me to do 12 minutes straight in zone 5 on the run, and 30 minutes straight in zone 5 on the bike!  I'm having a great deal of trouble with this.  How long should I be able to stay in zone 5?  Am I simply not pushing myself hard enough, or did I just fall behind at some point?  Edit: on Fink's zone definitions, he writes:     Zone 4: 90-95% of maximum heart rate (primarily anaerobic training)   Zone 3: 86-89% of maximum heart rate (middle zone)   Zone 2: 75-85% of maximum heart rate (higher-end aerobic training)   Zone 1: 65-74% of maximum heart rate (lower-end aerobic training)   His example puts a 35-year old at 166-175 bpm.  The vast majority of his plan is in ""zone 2."" "
2934,Will incline press target shoulders more than chest?,"In madcow 5x5, it states you can substitute incline press for overhead press, which focuses on the shoulders. Does this mean incline press works shoulders primarily, too? I am confused here, I thought incline press built your chest. Help? "
2935,bodyweight leg exercises for strength/hypertrophy,"I'm doing upper body bodyweight strength training (gymnastics stuff) for a while now, and would like to incorporate some leg exercises into my training.   I'm looking for 1-2 good compound exercises for legs. Probably I should be doing squats, but the problem is that I don't have a barbell at home in order to increase the intensity enough (for strength/hypertrophy stimulus). Of course, I One possibility would be to do pistols (one-legged squats), but I'm wondering if one-legged squats are equivalent to/as beneficial as weighted squats (with regards to muscle groups trained)?  Any other suggestions on exercises I could do? My equipment: some dumbbells, pull up bar, suspension-trainer (TRX), and a bench like this one. "
2936,What is dietary fat used for before being converted to adipose tissue?,"We know carbohydrates are used for immediate and stored energy (glycogen) before being converted to body fat.   We also know protein is used to repair tissue, mainly muscle for bodybuilders, before being converted to body fat. Conversion of protein into fat is 20 times less efficient than converting carbs into fat, so the body doesn't readily jump-start this conversion.  So what is dietary fat used for before turning into body fat? How readily does the body do this conversion compared to carbs and protein, and at what relative rate does it do it at? I ask this question because the word ""fat"" may be as misleading as ""cholesterol"". I learned from a previous question here that dietary cholesterol doesn't necessary increase cholesterol in the bloodstream. Maybe the same principle applies to fat... "
2937,Where did the idea that we should eat three times a day come from? Under what authority do most people follow this advice?,I'm trying to figure out if there's more than just tradition to the advice to eat three meals a day. Is the advice valid? Does it come from reliable sources? 
2938,How to avoid hyponatremia(drinking too much water) when hiking?,"I have read on various places that exercising for a prolonged period of time with excessive water intake can be dangerous. It may lead to water intoxication (hyponatremia).  After some searches and a few more articles, it seems that:   When you hike (especially in hot weathers) you sweat a lot. When you sweat your body loose electrolyte (namely sodium potassium calcium... etc) and also a lot of water. When you drink water, you replace the lost fluid, but NOT the salt/minerals. This means the fluid in your body is diluted and your body functions will be affected (confusion, lost of balance and death in severe cases).   Drinking less water is not an option because of the intense sweating when hiking for 9 hours or so under the hot sun.  An obvious choice was to replace water with sports drink like Gatorade.  Firstly, I don't like sports drink. Secondly, I want to know what is the exact thing my body lost with excessive sweating and needed to be put back into my body.  I am not a chemist/biologist, but from what I read, the term electrolyte is loosely used to refer to a group of minerals. Sodium, potassium, calcium and more.   If I drink salt water, will it help? If I eat banana (very rich in potassium), will it help?   But then, I am only getting sodium and potassium. Hikers recommend bringing complex carbohydrates and eating them frequently to fuel muscles.  I don't think complex carbs like wheat biscuits provide minerals when digested. They give a steady supply of sugar when digested, but sugar and carbs have nothing to do with body electrolyte balance.   Eating complex carbohydrates will fuel your body, but it does nothing to restore the electrolyte balance in your body, is this correct?   I weight 105kg and I am 6'2 (189cm), I drank around 5 litres of water in a 7 to 9 hours day-hike. I had some biscuits and 3 bananas, and 1.2 out of the 5 litres of fluid I had was sports drink.  However by the end of the hike I was feeling a slight headache. Was it because I was drinking too much water?  I want to find out what the body looses with excessive sweating, and what are the ways to eat/drink accordingly to replenish the lost substances. "
2939,Fingers for intensive sports requiring hands a lot? Recoving from ulnar claw?,"[Update] Thanks to the answer, I acknowledge now that I am heading towards ""ulnar nerve entrapment"" where one injury is Ulnar claw -- more common with males particularly training in gym with large weights and tennis players. This is due to stronger muscles blocking the ulnar nerve. The Wikipedia picture below at rest resembles the situation.    I have been under intensive training such as CFT, weight-lifting, tennis and climbing which all require a massive amount of effort on hands and fingers. On the morning I can feel that my fingers are not relaxed enough: particularly little finger and ring fingers which get an extra effort in dead-lifting, tennis volleys and tennis servings. This is a problem in tennis where non-relaxation can easily turn into pain due to fast swings.   Helper questions        Which methods to prepare fingers for intensive sports requiring hands a lot?   How to recover from ulnar claw and possible Ulnar nerve entrapment?     "
2940,What's the healthiest order to do things when you wake up?,"I understand it's healthy to exercise in the morning but should it be done after or before having breakfast or a snack? Also, it seems pointless to shower before exercising so I guess that should be postponed until after the work out? And I guess this question doesn't matter but just in case, does it matter when a person uses the toilet the first time in the morning, should it be done right away? Thanks. "
2941,How well do chest and back go together in the same workout?,"For the last 6 months I have been doing a 3 day routine twice per week in the following structure:   Legs and shoulders Chest and triceps Back and biceps   I have seen very good results with this routine (I'm fairly certain it is quite a common plan) but lately I haven been reading a lot about doing chest and back on the same day.  I'm considering changing my routine to:   Legs and shoulders Chest and back Biceps and triceps   But I am very skeptical of having two large muscle groups (chest and back) on the same day. I have always been under the impression that recovery doesn't yield good results if you hit multiple large areas. I did previously train biceps and triceps on the same day with better results than I am currently experiencing, but my current routine overall is working better.  Would this change have better results than my current routine? What are some pros and cons of what I am doing now vs the proposed routine? I've touched on some material talking about lactic acid moving around in a beneficial way during your workout if you alternate chest and back sets, but I'm not sure what is true and what's not.     My goal is mass.  "
2942,Are rest days required for Cardio?,"Suppose one wishes to start an aerobic workout routine.  Assuming one is young and without illness, is a 30 min a day workout (approx 15 min jogging and 15 minute walking intermittently) a reasonable workout routine, or should rest days be initially scheduled?   If rest days should be scheduled, how many per week would be recommended?  Would you recommend the number of rest days being reduced over time? "
2943,effects of sweating while working out,Are there any connection with sweating and working out?   Does sweating more means that I am burning calories? or is it ok not to sweat while working out? 
2944,Is Yoga a good synergy for my routine to improve flexibility?,"All,  I started working out 5 / 6 days a week since December previous. My routine involves alternating days of bodyweight training and running. All in all I am happy with my routine and see noticeable consistent results. Unfortunately as my strength improves, I am beginning to hit the limits of my body's flexibility when attempting more complex movements.  These issues stem from being grossly overweight for many years (23 stone @ 6ft) but I know they can be fixed since I my bodyweight and running training routine has done wonders for my general health and fitness.  I have been researching yoga as a way to improve my flexibility, would yoga be a good match? Is there a specific type of yoga I should look to, or are there other forms of flex training people have experience with?  I have included my current routine below. I would like to incorporate flex training into all 6 days if possible. Cheers  Bodyweight Routine (3 Days)   5 x Atomic Pushups (TRX) 5 x Lunges (Free Standing) 5 x Spiderman Pushups (Free Standing) 5 x Unweighted Squats (Free Standing) 5 x Pullups (TRX)   Repeated as a set until the first non conforming rep of any exercise  Running Routine (3 Days)   Day 1 : 5K under 35 mins Day 2 : 5K any pace Day 3 : 5k under 35 mins  "
2945,How to start with distance running,"I would like to start running long distance (well ~8km) Is it better to start off walking, with occasional jogging, the 8km and transition over time into running the full distance, or to start off running shorter distances (eg. 1km) and increase the distance over time?    I have just started going for runs and walks again, after breaking my ankle ~9 months ago(tripped when running). So far, I have been going back and forth between these two options 3-4 times a week for the past two weeks. Is one option better than the other, or is an all together different option best? "
2946,Biochemistry of working out while under psychosocial stress,"Does anyone happen to know some sources or ideas regarding the biochemistry of working out while under socially-caused stress?  This is a more in-depth follow-up, and focusing on the biochemistry, to a previous question, and so I think it deserves its own question--particularly since nothing like what I am seeking was answered in that one. (For example, I am completely uninterested here in the accepted answer there, which was to improve general health behaviors).  Elaboration:  I exercised today during a period of several days of very intense and lasting socially-caused stress/anger.  At the time of exercising, I was still actively angry, and quite aware of that...and thought that perhaps the exercise would do me some good to relieve some of my tension as well as just hit my regular exercise goal. The workout was a challenging (mostly inclined) treadmill workout of one hour, one that I have done a few times recently with no serious bad feelings afterward.  Tonight, though, after the workout, around dinner, I started to feel rather unwell.  It was almost like coming down with a flu, just really out of sorts, warm, tired, odd feelings in my head, etc.  I've felt ""run over by a truck"" before after hard workouts, but they are usually in the beginning of the process of getting back into shape. I know this workout is one my body was already mostly adapted to, but tonight it (possibly...maybe it was some other factor) made me feel quite unwell.  I am beginning to recover now.  The Question:  What is known about the biochemistry of the interaction between stress, particularly socially caused anger/frustration, and hard aerobic exercise or exercise generally?  My first pass hypothesis is that the exercise itself raises cortisol levels, but the anger/stress has already raised the basal cortisol significantly, and so the exercise-induced cortisol spike is riding on top of the social-stress caused basal level of cortisol, so the resulting cortisol levels are really high, and the poor feeling I have been having for some hours is the result of this. It may be any other biochemical molecule or molecule class, though--cytokines also come to mind.  A corollary question is whether it is unwise to exercise at these times, because of the catabolic effects of cortisol, let alone the potentially harmful effects of sustained elevated levels of glucocorticoids generally (cf. Sapolsky).   "
2947,Is taking a set to failure recommended for any type of lift or goal?,"I recently posted a question about light-headedness after squats, and it was mentioned that squat sets should not be taken to failure.  I can appreciate squats could be dangerous if one collapsed or passed out without safety bars available. Bench presses one could drop the bar on themselves. Heck, what happened to this guy doing bicep curls?  But is it only safety concerns or are there other good reasons not to take sets to failure? For bicep curls for instance, my last full rep would take 10 seconds to get to the top, then the next one would fail maybe about 20% through the contraction despite my every effort (while maintaining form) to keep it moving. Total muscle failure. Is this not recommended? "
2948,How useful is to drink an isotonic drink after a short running session?,I've been doing short runs this summer (~5k in more or less half an hour) and I decided to buy this powder to make isotonic drinks to recover after the exercise.  I know that in such a short time I have mostly lost water and salts from my body but I don't know if drinking an isotonic drink is useful or if it would be fine if I just drank some water afterwards.  When is it useful to drink an isotonic drink? How long should the exercise be? Does it make a difference in my recovery in my particular situation? 
2949,Are sprouts a good replacement for animal/whey protein?,"I find the taste of Whey protein unnatural and was wondering if I could supplement workouts with sprouts, apparently they contain 35% protein.   [website]Would 200g a day of sprouts allow a 160 pound trainer enough protein to maintain lean muscle mass? "
2950,How does support grip strength and crush grip strength differ so much?,"Apparently I can hold on to heavier dumbbells than others, but they can crush my hand much harder in a handshake. This tells me that support grip and crush grip can be very much apart. I believe there's not really a carryover from gripping strength to bar holding strength. I can only close the Trainer gripper, about 100 lbs. for a few reps, and my hands and forearms are dead.   I can, however, hold on to a 200 lb. dumbbell for a few seconds (one-handed).   I can also hang from a bar with almost my bodyweight added (200 lbs. + 200 lbs. = 400 lbs. of hanging support).  However, I know a guy who can't do either of the prior feats, but his grip in a handshake is quite impressive (overpowers mine). He also can't close much more than me in a gripper, but has a strong crushing grip.  My main question is, how does crushing grip differ from support in a muscular sense? Aren't they both the same recruitment of muscles used to close the hand?  How is it supposed to make sense that I can barely squeeze together a 100 lb. gripper spring, but can hold on to a 200 lb. dumbbell handle? Or support 200% of my weight hanging freely from a bar, but fail to crush an apple with my dominant hand?  I always hear people telling me I'm not too strong with my hands in handshakes for some reason (my grip strength is about average for an adult male in crush PSI), but average men can't hold a 200 lb. dumbbell in one hand. Anyone here could explain how the hand strength varies so much in different lifts (e.g. crush 200 lb. gripper, can't hold on to a 200 lb. bar, or hang with 200 lbs. added to bodyweight, but can't open a jar of pickles)? "
2951,Where (and how) can I drop weight safely?,"I'm a wrestler (I know, you probably think I'm starving myself right now).  Truth be told, I need to lose a couple of pounds (4 or 5) to make the weight class I want.  I'm not sure how feasible this is though.  Contrary to what some wrestlers believe, not eating food to lose weight also reduces your energy - effectively making you a bad wrestler with eating problems.  I'm a pretty light guy.  I'm about 142 pounds.  I'm trying to make it to 138 or less.  As far as my body goes, I'm pretty slim.    My question:    How this should my thighs be (sounds random right?-)?  Over all I'm really skinny, I've always thought though, that I have slightly larger thighs.  They aren't overly large though and nobody can really tell.  Is this normal?  How thick should my thighs be assuming I'm a slim guy at 142 pounds.  If they are too big, what exercise can I do to best replace that with muscle and hopefully slim down a bit in that area?   Really, I'm only asking this because I don't know and I feel awkward asking people that I know about thigh size (The internetz, on the other hand, is another story).  I could be normal for all I know.  If I'm normal, I'll accept being 142 and bulk up a bit to compensated for the upper weight class.  If it means anything:   I'm 5 foot 11 inches I weigh 142 pounds I'm a male  "
2952,Should I use weights training for endurance or for strength to deal with aching back?,"I'm a programmer and I spend a lot of time sitting in front of a computer typing, and this seems to be too much strain for my back and upper hand muscles.  All the orthopedists I talked to said these were muscle pains and that I should just start exercising (so this is not some injury, but rather poor fitness). However, I didn't think of asking them what kind of training that should be. Should I concentrate more on developing strength, or developing endurance? What are the pros and cons? Can I combine the two, and if so- what is the appropriate way to do that in a 3 times per week exercise schedule?  "

2954,Max lifting weight recommended for teenagers,"I'm 14, so I can't really lift a lot of weight, but my question is simple, for example on pushups you lift about 60% of your body weight in my case about 29 kilos (58 pounds), but trainers at the gym, say I can't lift more than 17 kilos (38 pounds) on machines and my question is:   Is there really a difference between machines and body weight?   Or could my maximum lifting weight be a little bit more, closer to what I lift with pushups? "
2955,Benefits on running completely soaked?,"Are there any benefits on running soaked in water?  I've been to a half-marathon length race recently. Temperature was high, above 25 ºC. There were runners who, in the provisioning sites (I'm not sure about the correct word, sorry, I mean the intermediate points where the organization offers you liquid or solid refreshments), took several bottles of water, emptying the first ones on themselves and drinking from the last one, looking like they just fell in the pool.  I was wondering if doing that provides a real benefit (like improved refrigeration, less sweating and minor loss of hydration).   I'm more likely to think it is abusive and can lead to running out of water for the other racers, but I'm interested in the physiologic and performance parts rather than in the ethics.  Edit: probable benefits are the cooling ""sensation"" and some extra help with thermoregulation. But, does it provide a lasting thermoregulation or is it counterproductive soon? I'm thinking of water nebulization in fire fighting, which is more effective than drenching for dropping the room temperature.  Edit: after the discussion and rethinking what words to use in searches I've found some contradictory related information:   Dehydration prevention tips: Change into dry clothing as soon as you can if your clothes get soaked with sweat. Dehydration and Heat Injury: Clothing that is dry slows down evaporation of sweat, but once wet, cooling continues. Thus, changing into dry clothes during transitions is not a good idea.  "
2956,Having elbow and forearm pain after kettlebell workout,I have been doing kettlebell workouts recently and I started having pain at the bottom of my forearm (right above my elbow).

2957,Pain with the Overhead Press,"I have recently started doing the overhead press as per Starting Strength.  I am getting a pain when I get close to the full extension of the press. It feels like a tendon pain as it is in a very small area at the top of the shoulder joint.  The pain only occurs if I press more than about 30kg or so.  What could be causing that pain?  Or if its not that easy to tell over the internet what is causing the pain, what steps should I go through to try to locate and fix the cause? "
2958,Applications of fast muscles,"It is my understanding that genetics plays a significant role in sprint speed.  Fortunately, I have always been a fast sprinter and enjoy sprinting over any kind of long distance running.  I presume that this genetic effect also applies to the other muscles of my body (I have a long  throw, for example) so I was wondering how I could capitalise on this - are there any particular exercises that would make the most of my muscle composition?  Or would any high intensity exercise be doing that? "
2959,Correct form for eccentric squats on slant board for treating patellar tendonitis,"In the book by Martin Koban ""Beating Patellar Tendonitis"" the correct form for eccentric squats on a slant board for treating patellar tendonitis involves having the shins as vertical as possible with little to no forward movement.  However, all of the videos of this exercise I can find on the internet show quite a bit of forward knee motion, for example: [website]In the correct form for eccentric squats on a slant board for patellar tendonitis, should the shin bone remain vertical or does it not really matter?

2960,Shortage of breath - is this a sign of overtraining,"I know there are lots of QAs available on over training and shortage of breath, but I could not find specific answers to my doubts/problems. I know few things cant be decided over a forum and I may need to consult a doctor; just want to clear my doubts before I take any decisions.  I have been training from past 4 months and my training involves 45-60 mins of cardio (2-3 times a week) and strengthening exercise (5 times a week). For cardio I'm doing  Spinning (indoor cycling) and I was doing good progress. However couple of weeks back while Spinning I was stretching myself a bit hard and at one point I felt shortage of breath and heart rate shot up and I felt faint and dizzy. Immediately I stopped cycling at that moment.   Now the problem is whenever I start cardio, I feel shortage of breath and breathing difficulty very soon and feel like my heart is pounding very fast though my muscles are not very tired. Because of this I have to slow down else I fear of fainting.  Is it because of over training? Did I damage my lungs or heart because of this? I'm bit scared to get back into hard training. Is there anything that I have to consider before getting back to training as before (I know doctor's consultation is one of it) "
2961,Sore after work out - can't straighten arm,"I'm in good aerobic shape but never did strength training.  Yesterday, I did some basic strength work, using both dumbbells and machines.  Nothing too crazy - I started light and built my way up.  I feel fine today, with a moderate soreness.  But, the one heavy pain I have is that I can't straighten my arms.  I felt this immediately after working out, and it's only gotten worse.  I feel pain on the inside of my arm (opposite my elbow), even if my arm is relaxed, and if I try to straighten it, it gets very intense.  I warmed up and cooled down aerobically, but didn't do any real stretching.  What causes this? Does it have to do with machines versus dums? What should I do to avoid this next time? "

If yes, I have a follow-up question: I am aware that 2,000 calories of fruits and veggies are harder to consume in large quantities so if your purpose is to gain weight, what's better: juicing it or eating it?  If no, then what do you suggest is the optimal way to gain weight without relying much on meat? "

While searching on youtube I found these tutorials for tabata   Burn fat in 4 min   4 min jump around tabata  by searching it on google I found that it burn around 15 calorie per minute (assuming that it has been performed with 100% effort)  but some of the website users claim that they have burned around 200 calories, which is astonishing because he didn't mention after burn.  So my questions are,   As there are many 4 minutes video available online for Tabata. Does all pattern burn same amount of calorie per minute? Do I have to worry about which exercise pattern I choose? Assuming that Tabata burns 15 calorie per minute so total would be 15*4 = 60 calorie.  Do I have to repeat the set or after burn can help me reducing more calorie?   I know this may be hard to calculate but I would appreciate if you can guide me with the approximate calorie reduce (after burn) when a person do only 4 min Tabata routine "

2968,Calories measured by these skiing like cardio machines in the gym?,"Hello and thanks for reading my question.  I like using the following type of skiing like machines in the gym which I'll describe, I couldn't find a name for it: I have to rest my both hands leaning slightly on the machines or just hold on the handles and move my legs side wise: each leg goes from the top position to the bottom position, but not at the same time; when the left leg comes to the top position the right leg attains the bottom position and vice versa. But there is no protruding handle which I've to handhold. It kinda feels like skiing, except the hands are not moving, but just resting on the machine. There are 25 different levels on it. I'm not sure what they call this cardio machine. I'd appreciate if you give me their names.  I always use it at the level 25 (supposed to be the highest level as far as my observation of calorie consumption goes), and it shows to burn 20 to 22 calories, mostly just using the quick start option. I've used these machines in more than one gyms in the US and France, the observation is the same. Generally, I know that the calories shown by cardio machines are not factual, but my question is: are these particular machines way off the actual calories that I burn or they are somewhat close? Burning 20 calories a minute seems to good to be true, but same kind of machines from at least 4 gyms in the US and France gave me same results over the last 2 years! I'm 30, male, about 5'6"", 152 pounds (=68.95 kilograms) and muscular built, have 19.1% body fat, 8.1% bone mass as my weight scale shows, work out 3 times a week with cardio and different kind of weights.  Did anyone test themselves on the machines I'm talking about and tell me whether I'm seeing the right amount of calories burnt? "
2969,How does isometric strength relate to isotonic strength?,Background  Isometric - holding a weight in the same position. Example: holding heavy bags of groceries.  Isotonic - moving the weight through a range of motion. Example: bicep curls.  Question  How does isometic strength relate to isotonic strength? Does increasing one increase the other? Or must they be trained individually to increase their respective strengths?  Application  Say I want to increase my ability to hold heavy bags of groceries for a long time. Would I train by holding dumbbells isometrically (farmer's walk)? Or would I train by doing isotonic exercises such as shoulder shrugs and bicep curls? 
2970,"I can speedwalk and not get tired, but any form of running kills me","I am just wondering why I speed walk so much and have plenty of endurance to walk at good paces for long times, but anytime I endure running I lose breath instantly.  Isn't speedwalking the same pressure on the heart as running? I mean to a somewhat degree the exercise makes the heart pump blood more and increase oxygen need right?  So why does running, even running slower than speed walking, tire me out more than speedwalking? "
2971,What exercises to do for archery antagonists?,"I just came home from a daylong (amateur) archery tournament with aching back and shoulders. I regularly do strength exercises with a Theraband™ but now I thought that I should probably do some exercises that stress the ""archery muscle agonists"".  Two questions:   Which muscles would that be? Which (Theraband) exercises would be appropriate?  "
2972,Getting enough calories with a suppressed appetite,"I never thought I'd be saying this...but I need to be eating more. I recently switched to a new medication which has been suppressing my appetite to the point that I can go all day without eating. I have to force myself just to get 700 calories a day, and even that is difficult. I've lost 15lbs in two months as a result, which is great but not necessarily healthy. I am 5'7"" and weighed in at 185lbs this morning.  I've been purposely eating junk food to try to raise my calorie intake and taking a multi-vitamin, but I need to find some healthier foods. So what can I eat that's healthy but still has a high enough calorie density to keep my body out of 'starvation mode'? I want to keep losing weight, but I'm worried my body is going to start burning muscle instead of fat.  Alternatively, is there something I can do to stimulate my appetite to an appropriate level?  Bonus question: It's easier for me to eat early in the morning or late at night. I know that the conventional wisdom is to eat small frequent meals, but how bad is it to get most of my calories at the beginning/end of the day? "
2973,"What is better for me: get a personal trainer, or, a program from a personal trainer?","I have had this personal trainer for a couples of times, and she seems really smart in her field of work. I feel I could actual see results from her work. Is it better for me to get a program to work on my own, or, to get her to be my personal trainer for a couple of weeks? I have a shoulder injury and I really can't stand it any more and would like to over come the issue. Would I be getting more result from her, or, more result from her program? I mean she is going to be making sure that all the exercise is done in the right form and that functional training exercises are effective. If I did it by myself, it may not be done correctly.  Another question: has any body had any issues, like in the shoulder and or another part that they got a personal trainer and saw result from their work?  I know that personal trainers cost money and program is the cheaper option. But at this point I don't mind seeing a personal trainer one or two month, if I am going to see genuine results! "
2974,"Dumbbell Bent-over Row, possible without bench?","The Barbell Bent-over Row is a well known exercise. It is one of the exercises that StrongLifts 5x5 consists of.  I was browsing exrx.net looking for a dumbbell version of this exercise but only found this Dumbbell Bent-over Row that only targets one hand at a time, while kneeling on a bench.  I have neither bench nor bar.  Is it safe to do the Bent-over Row as in the barbell version but using dumbbells? If it is safe: What are the differences between the barbell and 'my' dumbbell row and between the row on a bench and 'my' version? "

2976,good recovery workout to burn a lot of calories during strength training?,"I'm doing a strength training program, like stronglifts 5x5. I squat 3 times per week, my upper body exercises include bench, overhead press, weighted pullups, and barbell rows. I used to do track and field in high school, and I could just about anything without gaining fat. Now, I have to count my calories otherwise I start to gain weight. What are good workouts that can burn a lot of calories but not hinder my strength training?   -Some ideas: swimming, running, sprints, cycling. But I'm afraid doing too much will hurt my strength gains. Is it better to not exercise on rest days to actually rest? "
2977,How to handle increased appetite after intense training days?,"When I pick up a new type of intense sport or when I train significantly more than usually during the course of a week, my body reacts with insatiable hunger. I usually consume about 2000 to 2500 calories per day, mostly protein and carbs. During those hunger periods I could easily eat 4 big meals during the day (3500 to 4000 calories) and still be hungry when I go to bed. That is definitely more than I burn, even with increased activity.  How should I handle that? Should I simply listen to my body and eat until the hunger is gone or is my body overreacting to the challenge and I should stop eating after a certain point? I do not want to lose or gain weight, my goal is to stay fit and healthy. "
2978,How to change the weight during an exercise in order to train muscles more efficiently?,"I heard of different ways of how to handle weight increase (and decrease) when doing exercises for muscle training. I wondered which technique is the most efficient one when trying to train muscles.  For instance me and my buddy currently train after the following principle, any muscle group/exercise:  20 KG x 15 repeats to begin with wait 60 seconds 25 KG (= next possibly higher weight) x 15 repeats wait 60 seconds 30 KG (= next possibly higher weight) x 15 repeats (where the weight of course varies among the different muscle groups and exercises)  It often happens that you cant complete the third one (i.e. second repeat) because your muscles get limb. If so, we try to make it next time, i.e. a few days later starting again at 20 KG. If you can make it, next time (a few days later) we try to start with 25 KG in the first place, and so on.  So much to what we do. I've seen also people training like this:  Start at a weight where you can barely make 15 repeats, let's say 60 KG. Wait 60 seconds. Lower the weight by minimum possible value (eg. 5 KG) and make as many repeats as possible with that weight, so 55 KG. As many as you can. Then, wait 60 seconds and start over. And repeat.  Are there significant differences in those methods? Which is better? And why?  Thanks "
2979,Leg pain after running & jumping,"I haven't used to run much, but recently I started working out and it includes running also. I noticed that after I run about 400-500 m, my legs (both) start to hurt in the area of soleus muscle, on the internal side of the lower leg, about midway from the foot to the knee, pretty localized close to the bone. If I continue running or jumping, it becomes worse until it's quite intense so I can't run anymore. If I leave it alone, it passes in a couple of days and never reappears unless I run again or do a lot of jumping.  Any ideas why it's happening, is it because I'm doing something wrong (wrong shoes? wrong movements? weak muscles?) and if anything can be done to improve it?  "
2980,Is it better to run 3 ten mile runs with food breaks or one 24-26 mile run when training for a marathon?,Is it better to run 3 ten mile runs with food breaks or one 24-26 mile run when training for a marathon?  How would this translate to a race time? 
2981,Benefits of Squatting from bottom position as rest position,"So I was just thinking I got a home gym set up, and I can't really approach the bar under a power-rack as of yet...so I just clean it up over my head. I was interested in doing a back squat.  But this got me thinking - I know it's much easier to unrack the bar from a standing position, but would there be any benefit to having your starting position being at the bottom?  I think it would help activate your glutes and really force you to use those muscles and really ""find"" your hole...  What do you guys think? Any benefit? Any negatives? Other than the trouble with unracking the weight in a hole?  Thanks in advance! "
2982,At what age can I start taking supplements?,"I'm 13 years old (14 in June) and I've been working out for some time.  I'm getting what I feel like are awesome results in definition and size of the muscles, but I feel the actual quantity of weight I can lift is growing at a pretty slow rate (I haven't figured out what the problem is).  The other guys at my gym are telling me I shouldn't worry, but I can smell they are telling me that only because they don't want me feeling bad about it; consider that they are older than me (a couple of guys aged 17 have been coming to the gym in the last weeks, but their knowledge is worse than mine), the youngest one is 18/19 (unless there is someone younger coming at different schedules, which is unlikely if you know my gym).  Last week I went to a nutritionist who made me a diet which I'm following right now, but I want to do more, I want to up my game, I'm a really competitive dude.  I asked my gym mates their opinion on the matter, they told me they think I'm too young for that.  But I don't see why, I'm pretty sure it doesn't mess up someone's growth (I'm talking about growing up, not gym-related growth).  Why do they think that? I have the motivation to do it, is there something important I'm unaware about?  I'm hoping that taking them would give me a boost. "
2983,What training pattern should I use to develop V-sit and V-hang?,"I would like to acquire a V-sit and V-hang (from a neutral vertical hang; without chest or shoulder assistance). I can hold a passable L-sit for 5-10 seconds on parallettes, but not from a hang (although I can hold one better at the top of a pull-up). I may be missing some technical points when executing the L-hang given how it lags behind.  I have a fairly clear idea of progressions to develop the L-sit (such as shown in this video), but what I'm less clear on is what pattern of training to apply; rounds, repetitions, days, and so on.  I'd also welcome suggestions for exercises. My current plan was to focus on holding a tuck and then partially extend the legs as possible. With a view to Vs I wonder how I should attempt to train that range of motion, since my legs never go past the horizontal at the moment I wonder whether I will actually progress towards the V without some elastic bands or a partner to support the legs, even if I improve my Ls?  The sort of answer I'm looking for is of the form: ""X seconds every Y days of L-sit/tuck/lifts."" I'd like to push this fairly hard. "
2984,What should I do to get a clear reading on testosterone?,"I'm taking a testosterone test via blood on Monday for free and total testosterone. I'm wondering, is there anything I should do or not do prior to taking the test to get the best and clearest reading? I already know taking it in the morning is the best time to take it, since that's when it will be at it's highest, but what else should I do or not do? Will not eating prior to taking the test help? Thank you. "
2985,Scientific studies on methods to improve pushups?,"There are about as many ""methods"" to improve pushups as are there web pages that talk about improving pushups.

What scientific studies are out there that compare an measure different ways to improve pushups?  "
2986,What should I look for in a jump rope?,"When browsing around the various articles linked in answers here, I keep stumbling over rope jumping in articles or blog post. I was never good at rope jumping, at least that's what I thought. Actually I never tried to do it. The last time I did it, I was a kid and gave up pretty quickly.    Looking around on amazon gave me the expected results, far too many variations, far too many decisions to make for an item I don't even know how to use properly.  There are different materials for the rope, I've seen nylon, leather and steel. Also of course different lengths, how do I know which length is right for me? Some ropes are called speed ropes, is this just another name or is it really a difference?  There are weighted grips available and grips that explicitly mention that the grips are not weighted. I am somehow reminded of jogging with ankle weights here, which supposedly isn't useful. Does it matter how the rope comes out of the grip: straight or sideways? Some grips have ball bearings for the rope, sounds reasonable. To take a break just because the rope is twirled wouldn't be motivating, but is this really a concern?  Last thing I spotted was that there are indoor and outdoor ropes, I would definitely start indoor, but I would want to go outside, are there ropes that can do both or should I simply buy one for each purpose? They aren't that expensive after all. "
2987,Separating cardio and weight training,"Is it best to split your cardio and weight training when doing them on the same day? Should I wake up an hour earlier to run, then do the gym in the afternoon? I'd try and go to bed an hour earlier to make up for it, but let's be honest .. that doesn't always translate to an hour of sleep. Changing my sleep schedule around throws my body off, and that extra hour of sleep in the morning is dearly missed. So the question comes down to: is better sleep > splitting cardio and weights. With the cliche goal of gain/retain muscle and burn fat. I've felt I kinda plateaued and looking to tweak anything minor to help myself improve.   My typical week looks like this:  Monday - Weight training  Tuesday - Weight training + running (4.5 miles) Wednesday - Weight training Thursday - running (4.5 miles) Friday - Break Saturday - Break Sunday - sprints (45 minutes) "
2988,How can I reduce trembling during training?,"There are some exercises in my training routine that I cannot perform without my whole upper body trembling like crazy. Pushing dumbbells to train breast or shoulder muscles is one example. I use dumbbells that I can push 3x12 times. I can perform the motions slow and exact - I am sure the weight of the dumbbells I use fits the exercise well.  Nevertheless my whole upper body trembles during this exercise right from the start until the end. People spotting me for the first time think that I am already at my limit and that I am about to fail, when in reality I am perfectly comfortable.  What can cause that trembling and what can I do about it? Should I ignore it or might there be a problem with the exercise? "
2989,How to improve baby finger's extension and flexion? How to relax it? How to stretch it?,"My baby finger has not become relaxed enough due to wrong technique in tennis, too much stress on it and more here. The only moment I can feel the toughness is when I am totally relaxed like after sleeping so it does not limit my activities at all but I don't want to get it bad neither so important to learn to get it more relaxed. So     How can I improve baby finger's extension and flexion? How to relax it and how to stretch it?   Hand's 2-5 fingers flexion/extension     According to this, normal ROM values are 85-105 degrees for the flexion and 20-30 degrees for the extension.

2990,Bridge variations,"Are the short-bridge (shoulders on the ground) and the straight bridge (hands stretched, back straight) as good for the back as a full-bridge?

2991,"Running, eating less but not losing weight?","I've been running for the past month and a half and watching what I eat for the past three weeks. I started out at 77,1kg and have been stuck around 75,5kg for the past week or longer.  I've completely cut candies and anything junk food related from my diet (so no chocolates, sugar in coffee or chips for me). Usually I have an oatmeal cooked in a cup of milk with a banana for breakfast, then i.e. chicken curry with lowfat yogurt for lunch and fruit or eggs for dinner. During the day I also eat fruit, I'll usually have a banana if I'm in for a run, and loads of tangerines.   I go for a run (well, it should probably be called a jog) three times a week, lasting about half an hour, about 4km in length.  I should probably note that this was a part of the Couch25k plan, so I haven't started out with these times or lengths.   Still, I feel stuck at my weight for some time now. It could be that I'm not drinking enough water, especially at weekends. Is there anything I could try and change? Add some other form of workout? Run more? Eat something else? "
2992,How long before a judo tournament should I switch from strength to conditioning?,"I've got a judo tournament in early May for which I want to be strong, quick in my reaction time and strength output, and in condition. Since it's still pretty far in the future, I'm working on strength for the moment. My judo training is year-round, so this is about my supplemental strength &amp; conditioning training.   When should I switch from strength to conditioning? Should it be a slow transition, keeping some strength work, or an abrupt and total switch?   Background  My high-bar back squat is my current primary strength project. I am currently squatting singles of 270 pounds (122.5 kg) at a bodyweight of 175 (79.4 kg), and triples around 250 (113.4 kg) , but would like to hit 300 (136 kg) if possible before transitioning. I'm deadlifting at 370 (168 kg) for a comfortable 1RM and 390 (177 kg) for a not-quite-good-form 1RM, and would like 405 (181.4 kg) before transitioning to other work. Upper-body work and the quick lifts are on rehab duty, so I won't bring them into this. I fully comprehend that the 300 and 405 goals are not necessarily possible in that timeframe, nor ideal for judo.  I can do a twenty-minute lifting or conditioning session on my lunch break, which I generally do two to four times a week (usually 10 squat singles or working up to a heavy 3 or 5 rep deadlift). I do longer lifting-plus-mobility sessions once or twice a week and can train judo one to four times a week. "

2996,Basal Metabolic Rate calculation,"I am 48, male, 5ft 9 inches tall, and weigh 225 lbs.   My daily calorie intake is approximately 2200 calories...this is a balanced diet, high in protein and fibre, not high in carbs, low in fat...I don't snack apart from fruit in the morning and some chocalate in the evenings (and that's been factored into the 2200 calories)  I have low muscle mass, and have always had a low metabolism...  As I understand it from LiveStrong - How to lose 10 lbs a month I can caculate my metabolic rate as below:  66 + (6.23 x weight in pounds):  66 + (6,23*225) = 1449.06   add 12.7 * height in inches  12.7 * 69 = 876.3   subtract 6.8 * my age (48)  - 6.8 * 48  =324.6   So this totals up to 1998.96  Then it says to multiply that by either 1.35 (for lightly active) or 1.55 for very active....  and these give either 2748 or 3098 calories needed to maintain weight...  Now, I am walking 35 miles a week in total, walking around 3.5 miles per hour...this is my only exercise as I have a shoulder injury that will take some months to fix with physio and injections  So my question is, am I lightly active or very active?  I am guessing I am something between the two, it would certainly make me feel better if I could put very active considering that I am only taking in around 2200 calories a day  Or do I need to ramp up the daily walking to 7 miles a day, around 50 miles a week before I can call myself very active and calculate my BMA as 3098?  To clarify, I am aware that I am obese/morbidly obese - trying to do something about it.  Thanks "
2997,Will eating more calories help in mountain climbing?,"For my mountain climbing activities, will eating more calories will allow me to perform a bit better / longer? Is there is an upper limit on the amount of calories a person's body can absorb every day, be it through fat, carbohydrates or protein?  As an example: My standard dehydrated expedition pack has about 1300kJ / 100g. That is about 310kCal / 100g. One pack contains about 600g of food, so I end up with 1860kCal for one meal.

If my interval is run 2, walk 1, how slow is that walk supposed to be or allowed to be?  I'm not trying to win anything, but I don't want to cheat myself or stop my ability endure for longer races.  I guess the same could be asked about the running.  How fast should it be?  My 5k is about 43 minutes.  Slow, but I'm not too, too worried about it.

3000,Benefits of speedwork during Marathon-training,"After several half marathons and trailruns of around the 25km, I started training for my first marathon on the 15th of Octobre this year. Currently I'm running about 4 times a week with the longest run about 24km (15 miles) without getting into trouble. Running a total of 55km (34 miles) a week. Steadily (without exaggerating) i'm building up my training volume.  A friend of mine (who already ran several marathons so far) advised me to incoperate some speedwork into my training. However i don't want to race within a specific time, I just want to finish without suffering too much.  So my question is, what are the benefits of speedwork during marathon-training? Keeping in my mind that I won't race to arrive within a specific time. Wouldn't it be better just to keep increasing my milage at a steady pace?  Note: I did ready up on some internet-pages. But they all seem to refer to a better finishing time. "
3001,Is this enough?,"So recently I started working out in the mornings at home. I'm wondering what kind of ""gains"" I will be able to witness from these types of workouts, if any. and not ""witness"" as in aesthetic necessarily but ""witness"" as in functional strength perhaps, aesthetics, health, etc...  Background  Worked out for a couple years prior, 1 year consistently. 5x5 program was most recent where I hit some PRs:   Deadlift - 325lb  Bench - 225lb  Squat 245lb   Went on vacation came back and started a new job that requires additional travel time, which keeps me out of the gym. put about a month in between my ""real"" workouts and any strength training  I decided to start building up my home gym. Here's what I have:   25lb Dumbbells  2x 45lb Plates  Long ez-curl bar (I know some people see the really curved one, this one is not like that it's longer and not as dramatic curves) Total weight with plates = 125lbs Pull-up bar   So a typical workout consists of about 15-20 minutes:  I am doing something like    5 x 10 pushups// superset 5 x 5 pullups as a warmup to get the blood flowing  4 sets of 25 dumbbell curls one side at a time.  4 sets of 10 bent over rows  4 sets of 10 deadlifts  4 sets of 10 floor press 1 set of 12-15 clean and press 3 mile jog/run   I mean Idk.. I generally pick like 3-4 of these aforementioned exercises and break a sweat. keep in mind this is between 5:30am and 6 so my time is limited. I'll work out like this 3 times a week  So my question is:   Am I going to see any benefits from this?  Specifically with the compound movements will this keep me in good enough shape to go back to the gym and hit my previous PRs? Should I increase the amount of workouts I do per week? Is there any other good exercises I'm not taking advantage of with the equipment I have?   Thanks in advance guys, really appreciate it!   and for all you goal-chasers out there. My main goal would probably be to just drop body fat, lean out, stay lean for the summer, and then get back in the gym or get a power rack and more weights this winter.  "

3003,Debating Whether to Get Personal Trainer or Not,"I am an undergraduate at Madison, WI, with a goal of building my body and stay in a strong fit.  As a start, I have been enrolling for group classes such as Cyc Fitness (intense cycling) and Muay Thai, but I might need a personal trainer as I have no idea about how to use various instruments, what exercise I must do per day (I learned that I cannot simply do shoulder, back, leg, etc. exercises in one day), meal plan, etc.  As with quite many other college students, my financial stability is not quite strong, so I cannot afford famous personal trainers from private gyms near my area (cost like $1000 per 20 sessions, one session for 50 minute long)...My university's sporting department offers paid personal training (much cheaper than the private gyms) but the trainers are fellow undergraduates that might not have strong experience as trainers form those gyms.  I do not mean any offense to student trainers, but I am debating whether it would be good idea to get personal trainer.  Specifically, I am debating if I should suck up and train with those private personal trainers, or choose campus' personal training.  What are your thoughts?  How long one must do personal training before able to do on my own?  I am very sorry for this long email! "
3004,How to make my wrist muscle thicker but strong?,"When someone grabs my forearm, he/she can easily grasp it just with one hand. It is because my forearm muscle is not thick enough.    Question   What exercise is good to make my forearm (especially the wrist part and its vicinity) thicker or bigger but strong so it becomes difficult to be grasped?  What food is good for it?  "
3005,Can I hurt myself or my heart by running too hard or in bad weather conditions?,"I've been running for about 10 months now, started in January, when it was about -15 °C outside. Over the time, I managed to lose about 15kg and improved my running a lot, but I always come across the same problem.  I sometimes tend to run too hard. For example, there are a lot of uphills on my track, some of them are really steep. Sometimes I try to run up as fast as I can until I get completely exhausted. But I'm not just exhausted, I can feel my heart pumping so hard, I can feel it on my chest, in my ears, just everywhere.  I don't have a heart rate monitor, but I've been practicing with measuring it on the neck, and I can on average say if it's 1.5, 2 or 3 beats per second, which gives me a rough idea of my BPM. The problem is, that when I stop, I sometimes feel like it's 3 beats per second, or even more, which seems dangerous.  Is there any limit where I should stop pushing myself to prevent some serious injury? I've never been diagnosed with any heart problem, or anything else (I'm 22).  I know that many people recommend running at a pace when I can somewhat sustain a conversation. But I also read, that it's good to practice sprinting once in a while. So I'm trying to mix the usual 5K and 10K with some faster paced uphill sprinting (I know it's not really sprinting).  I don't feel any heart pain when I stop, at least not like I'm gonna pass out, only a little bit. But I can feel the blood pumping really hard and can barely catch a breath. I usually try to run past the point where I want to stop, and just put on the music a little louder and run until the point where I have to stop.  When I add current weather conditions (it's about 5 °C out right now), is training like this good idea to improve my overall endurance, or should I stop immediately to prevent some serious injury? "
3006,Genetics-healthy foods-workouts result get taller,"Genetics are 70% or 80% that influence how tall we will be. 20% is food how healhty we eat.I came to ask three questions.First, workouts arent influence our body how tall could we be?I give an example, muscles, when we give effort to build on biceps we can make it bigger if we try for a long period.As a result ,what about hanging workout,this workout  influence the body to ""become"" taller or not?Second,when someone take 4inches lets say he takes which part of the body increase legs or his back? Third, i am hanging everyday at moring for 10 minutes my age is 26. If it could be to take an inch could this a good way? Thanks "
3007,Why are kettlebells so expensive?,"Compared to other free weights, kettlebells seem disproportionately expensive per kg. A quick search turns up only speculation, so an acceptable answer should have a source.  Plausible(?) hypothesis from the internet:   Shipping is expensive Production happens only overseas (corroborates with 1.) Low demand -> low supply and higher prices Different material (are they any different internally than other weights?) Higher production costs due to shape   Why are kettlebells so expensive? "
3008,Feasible to use an exercise step with risers as a bench?,"I want to stepping and benching to my exercise routine. Instead of two pieces of equipment, is it feasible to also use a step with risers as a bench?  I know I could use a bench as a stepper, but as best I can tell, there's just one flat height for a bench and therefore one height for a stepper.  My preference is an adjustable step that can be used as a bench.  But is that feasible (safety, comfort, etc.)? "
3009,Lack of sleep and gym working out,"I need help on this topic.  I get up at 4am and come back home at 11pm which means im in bed at 12am and getting up at 4 am again ( and the cycle repeats)  Im want to start working out at a local gym but im afraid that the lack of sleep time will affect anything ( gains, fatloss, etc).  What can i do in order to max gains and fatloss? or shouldnt even start working outat a gym?  "
3010,How should I integrate CrossFit with Martial Arts training for endurance and strength gains?,"I have been practicing martial art for a number of years, usually about 3 times a week. Recently I've come to conclusion that my fitness level (which is rather low) impedes my progress and MA training I am doing is not enough to increase my fitness, so I joined a Crossfit gym. So far I like it, but my question is how to combine Crossfit with my martial art training for best results. I have about 4 to 5 days a week that I could exercise (depending on work, family circumstances, etc.), about 1-1.5hr a day, and I would like to do at least 2 days of each MA and CF if possible. What would be the best regimen?   MA training is 1 hour (sometimes 1.5 hr) usually involves some cardio exercise which depends on the practice, partners, etc. could be from pretty easy to quite challenging, but does not require too much strength usually. The CF workouts are usually within 1 hour too and depend on WOD.  So far I feel I am making some progress fitness-wise, but I am concerned that doing fitness training only 2 times a week may be too little to make good progress. Is it true and if yes, what would you advise?   If it's relevant, I'm 37 y.o. male, not very fit but healthy, somewhat overweight (BMI=27).    Update: the aspects I want to improve is primarily endurance and secondarily strength, i.e. I want to be able to do more pushups, more pullups, etc. I don't want to be a powerlifter or competing athlete, just to improve the fitness level. "
3011,"Marathon training with high-ish distance, low instensity","I've been cycling to work the last 2 years, and now I decided I wanted to switch it up and mostly run it. It's 7km (~4 miles I guess), so twice a day 5 days a week pretty much. Gives me ~70km per week. I've been doing it 2-3 weeks now, goes well.  I ran marathons before - like 3 or 4, usually every 2nd year or so. Haven't done any for about 4 years now and I'm missing it. I've always been between 4-5 hours because although I was very active and I did track &amp; fields before and have always been running say once a week or so, I never really trained for a marathon. I'm 34.  Because life, I don't think I'll be running a whole lot more than during my week. I do other sports as well - I shouldn't need to worry about doing core/strength work (other sports take care of that).  So I'm going to have a fair mileage, but not that much intensity. I mean I can get a few interval in (say on the way back) but 7km isn't a lot of distance to warm-up, cool down AND do intervals. Also don't really wanna get to work already busted.  My question is: would it be realistic to aim for a 3:45 finish with that type of training/background, by summer's end (say 16 weeks from now)? Or am I likely to realize that I would really have needed some amount of higher intensity to really make that work?   Or put another way - how good can your marathon time get with mostly consistent mileage?  EDIT: my current pace going to work is ~5min/km or ~8 min/mile. My watches says I'm around 130-140 bpm. It feels like a good workout but I'm not exhausted and I think I could maintain that for at least 10 miles. I also ran a 10km race last week-end (flat, cool temps) and ran in 44 minutes and felt easy - I think I might have been able to do close to 40 if going all-out. "
3012,Train for strength or hypertrophy?,"I'm almost 19 years of age and I am regularly doing gym since 3 months. With the height of 5'10 and weight of merely 115 pounds, I initially joined the gym with the intention of becoming a little 'bulky' and put on some muscles.  I was very much a computer bug few months ago and didn't pay due attention to my own body or other's body as a standard of benchmark, but now that I do, I see in trains or other public places that most people already have bulky biceps and chest without maybe even visiting the gym once, then there are these bulky sorts of guys that come to the gym and the weight they lift or press, is laughable looking at their muscle mass. I mean it's obviously more weight than me, but not by a very large margin, just 2-5KGs more than what I do, so I believe its very attainable in near future.  Some time ago I came across the phrase hypertrophy vs strength training (for me strength training included all types of lifting earlier). Currently, my gym trainer has prepared a workout routine for me that is something like :  Everyday : Chinups : 15x5 ; Push-ups : 10x5 at start ; Wrist curls 20x5 and shoulder press 15x5 (with a weight lighter than I usually use for shoulder press) Monday: Chest 4x10 (consists of 4-5 exercises for chest) ; Triceps : 3x10 (again, 4-5 usual exercises for triceps) Tuesday : Back : 3x10 ; Biceps : 3x10 Wednesday : Shoulders : 3x10 ; Legs : 3x10 Repeat on tuesday, friday and satudray  There are some exceptions like for calf raise the reps are 20-25.  So from what I see, he wants me to train for hypertrophy? Again, I don't want to do all this hard-work and become simply fluffed, I want to genuinely get stronger, to lift more weights and strength that accompanies me everyday, not just the looks of it.  I have done some research of what hypertrophy is but I still remain largely a noob, so if I train for strength, lets say adding more weight than I currently do for 4-6 reps, that will make me neurologically stronger and also help with atleast some muscle gains?  Or perhaps I should go for both of them? How do you suggest I incorporate those changes so that I train for strength as well as size?  Also, I understand what is progressive overload, but under what method is it applied? Strength or Hypertrophy? and how do you properly incorporate it?  Eg- I do military overhead press with let's say 5 KG on both sides, now for progressive overload to occur, should I increase subsequent reps from 6 to 8 to 10 in next sets or should I increase weight from 5 to 7.5 to 10 KG? and the reps go down from like 10 to 8 to 6?  Which is better and is there a difference? or should I maintain my rep count whilst increasing weight?  Then again, looking at my body frame of height 5'10, weight 115 pounds, 26 inch waist, 11 inch biceps and just chicken legs, which will be better for me? I intend to continue going to the gym for many coming years. "
3013,Is there a logical progression between snowboarding and skiing for those who want to learn both?,"We are a family of skiers and snowboarders. In discussing which sport to teach our children first we keeping coming up with merits for both. Our intention is to eventually teach both sports and let the kids decide which they like best.   Is there an advantage to teaching one or the other first?  Would an experienced skier have an easier time learning snowboarding, or vice versa?  Would this possibly vary by age, particularly for young children (starting as young as is practical)? "
3014,How to maintain push ups training,"I trained for several months in order to achieve my goal of a hundred push ups in a row. To do so, I slowly increased the number of push ups every time I trained. I did not do the training with push ups in a row, it was just the goal.  Now that I can do it, I'd like to maintain my level. How should I do it? Will doing 100 push-ups frequently be sufficient, or should I divide my training again ?  Just to be clear, I don't want to increase my number of push ups (I don't want too large muscles), just to be able to do 100 push ups in the future.  "
3015,Are bent rows a good substitute for lat pulldowns?,"I've been working through the set of plates on a pulldown machine (w/ v-grip) trying to get to the stage where I can do chin-ups. At 90kg now, not far off my bodyweight of 102kg.   But the pulldown machine at my gym is now out of order, and things never get fixed quickly.  So caught without a machine and no backup plan, I did bent over rows (barbell) that session, 2x5, then 1x5+, thinking it would pretty much target the same muscles I thought chin-ups would be using, i.e., lats and biceps.  Are bent rows appropriate and if so, in a 3x5 format? Lift to the upper or lower rib-cage?  One thing I didn't like about the bent rows is even though I wasn't hunching my shoulders, I could feel the traps getting hammered up at the neck, and me no like ski-slope shoulders. "
3016,Freestyle swimming: Where to breath in (chest vs. stomach)?,"Everyone just talks about inhaling, but no one ever specifies whether to breath in your chest (shallow breathing, clavicular breathing, thoracic breathing), your stomach (Diaphragmatic breathing, abdominal breathing, belly breathing), or maybe both.    Does one of these techniques have an advantage over the other?   Is there consensus about which technique to use?   If so, why?  "
3017,"Not gaining strength, even after following routine, diet, exercise, sleep, etc","I've been interested in the strength world for a long time. While I don't limit myself to any specific muscle groups, I never gain much strength. And when I do gain strength, I tend to lose it very quickly, even despite continuation and progression. In other words I will get a tiny burst of strength increase some days, but it fades away and I go back to ""neutral"" very soon (few days). I also have no balance of strength, as some days I'll feel much stronger and energetic in lifts, and other days I'll fatigue from almost nothing.  Factors that could be considered:  1.I breathe through my mouth, not nose; very little breathing through nose. For this reason I don't breathe much, meaning I have adapted myself to breathe less to avoid gaping like a fish for breath out of my mouth, which looks stupid. Also, I have been made fun of for doing it, so I've learned to do it much less often, and in smaller amounts, etc.  2.I have no endurance and never train for it. Since I don't have any goals in the fitness world, it is pointless to me to consider doing reps since my only goals are strength, power, and ability to apply large loads of force. Fitness isn't crucial, but I don't know how ""not important"" it may be in the long run, since I see hugely fat and obese, out of shape, lazy people that can lift 600 lbs.  Often I'll slowly try to increase the weight over every week or so, but I'll just do a few reps. If I lower the weight I do too much sarcoplasmic training, which I don't care for and doesn't show strength results. If I ""moderate' the weight I just fatigue moderately, but don't see long-term gains. I've tried mixing the exercises around, changing types of weight, angles, doing bodyweight exercises, etc. There's no real improvement no matter what I do. I see people lift a weight twice a week and they're gaining strength instantly, and I do it for months and there's no noticeable progression.  I eat what I can, but roughly 2,000+ calories a day at 5'9"" tall. Probably 60-100 grams of protein, decent nutrients, but diet could improve if I had the option to improve it. I get 6-8 hours of decent sleep every night; sleep isn't great, but it's decent. I do static/dynamic stretching, warm-ups, have normal levels of testosterone, start with light weights to get a good ""feel"", then work up. What could be wrong here? I was advised to consult a physician by some people, but it sounds kind of stupid since there's no noticeable problems with me that would impede strength gains.  Programs? I don't follow any, but any decent regimen of training should increase strength. People got stronger before ""strength programs"" existed, so I will not consider any, including Starting Strength. "
3018,Chin-ups on a bar versus straps,"I've been doing chin-up negs to try and work up to unassisted chin-ups, but not having a bar at home or even a space or even a standard door to put one, nor local availability of a reasonably pricing ceiling mounted unit, I've been doing them on TRX straps hanging from the ceiling, spaced about 2 feet apart.  I'm finding the negs quite difficult, compared to when I'm at the gym and use a bar. After about 6 weeks, I've progressed on a lat-pulldown machine from 2x8x63kg to 2x8x90kg, yet the chin-up negs don't seem to be getting any easier on the straps, only on the bar at the gym.  Possibly the straps need to be a bit closer together, directly above the shoulder joints? Or are some stabilisers just getting smashed, limiting the effectiveness of the negs for building up to chin-ups? "
3019,"Max HR lower than others, what does it mean?","I am 41 and do a lot of cycling. I have not been physical fit all my life but I have really gotten into biking over the last year, I get out most days and somedays I have been out for 7 hours. This is mountain biking and its all VERY hilly due to the area I live in so its is always demanding.  I cycling with people the same age some older and although we are the same pace etc there HR goes higher than mine? they can hit 180, I never go above 160. I tend to be around 155 for most of the ride.  What does this mean? does my HR not peak as high as I have not been fit all my life.   edit - My resting HR is low, sometimes just under 50 but norms 50 to 60. "
3020,Weights with abs at home,"I haven't money to join a gym,that means I can't have big abs and visible?  As I have read in internet abs grow faster with weights? What can I do to increase abs ?I have seen and done a lot of those workouts but really I dont see or feel any difference on my abs growing. Thanks in advance "
3021,What's the necessity of cardio for fat burning?,"I hear all rumors about that only with cardio you will burn fat properly. But why should I do cardio, instead of weightlifting? isn't it all about the caloric deficit? I don't see why I should replace 30 minutes of weightlifting with 30 minutes of cardio, when I try to lose bodyfat. "
3022,Do you have a post training window with regard to eating any foods?,"   Possible Duplicate:   Is it true that you can eat anything you want within 15 minutes of working out without putting on weight?       My friend and I were having an argument where he was saying that you can pretty much eat any food after working out and even if its unhealthy, there is a window of time where your body is looking to replenish itself. This article seems to agree with me but is there any truth to this comment? "
3023,"Natural ways to ""enhance"" your results?","Often people say that the only ""real"" way to see ""real results"" is with AAS/PEDs. I disagree.  There have to be various other ways to improve things like muscle synthesis; improve satellite cell functioning; increase nervous system and muscle recovery; and even increase size too.  Obviously besides just working out and ""hoping."" I'm talking about ""natural enhancements.""  We know of the typical stuff people taut: creatine, caffeine, ""supplements,"" etc.  What else is there? What's the real holy grail that can (almost) compare to high doses of AAS/PEDs?  As long as it isn't AAS/PEDs. Good sleep never made me wake up looking like Phil Heath; neither did a 20,000 calorie surplus, 900g of protein, zero stress, or years of training. Something's gotta give.  How can we create true enhanced natties, without the steroids, growth hormones, insulin, etc.?  Remember, before this garbage existed we still played sports professionally &amp; adored great bodies. "
3024,Any hints for switching to isometric exercises?,"I'm 50 and, due to low back pain and various joint problems, I'm gradually switching my exercise routine to isometrics. The problem is that they do not seem to work for me.  Started with replacing crunches with the plank three months ago. Can hold the plank for 90 seconds, which is fairly good according to Mr Google; the feeling of muscle load is present too. Yet, I don't like the visual outcome of it and, objectively, my pants concur. I'm going pear-shaped.  Seeing this, I decided to add isometric neck exercises as a test. Never did neck exercises before, so it's a blank slate and a good indicator: no effect whatsoever in two months.  I'm clearly doing isometric exercises wrong(ly). Any advice? Any common mistakes to watch for? "
3025,Healthy Resting Heart Rate,"I've read that a normal resting heart rate is anywhere from 60-100 BPM, which is  a huge, unhelpful range. The charts I've seen seem to contradict this normal range, where they say that a RHR in the 80s is on the unhealthy side. So, which is it?   I'm a 30 year old male, 5'2"", 130lbs and I live a pretty sedentary life style. So, should I be worried that my RHR is around 85-88? "
3026,What are the short term effects of caffeine on workout?,"Note that this question is related to Excessive caffeine consumption effect on heart/body. The question and answers however only cover long term usage effects, I want to know about the short term effects.  Which effects does consumption of caffeine during workout have? I usually drink one or two 0.7l bottles of water before, during and after workout. I drink about one or two cans of tea daily, and was wondering if it has a detrimental effect when I keep drinking tea instead of water while working out. I also noticed that some pulverized energy drinks contain some amount of caffeine and was wondering what the effects of caffeine consumption are on both strength and cardio exercises.  As I regularly drink coffee, tea or mate I am somewhat used to caffeine. Would there be different effects if I'd increase the dose or if someone who isn't used to caffeine would start consuming during exercise?   "
3027,What sports or activities work out abs/core intensely without specifically being an ab/core exercise?,"I enjoy exercising, but far more when it's an activity like running, biking, rowing, yoga, rock climbing, etc... It's ok with me if those activities take place in a gym, like treadmills, just not a specific gym exercises like a bench press, lat pulls, etc.  Of all the exercises one can do in the gym, by far my least favorite are those targeting my core and abs.  With that, can anyone recommend things that are ab/core heavy activities?   To define that in negative. Not any of these routines [website]Kayaking comes to mind, but there must be others that give an intense ab workout? "
3028,Questions about working out,"I started going to the gym about 3 weeks ago and I'm confused about some things:   When I started, my muscles were sore after the workout and I did some research and found out that it's completely normal. But now, I don't feel any soreness again. I've tried increasing the weight of everything I'm doing but I'd only get tired when lifting but I won't feel any soreness at night or the day after. Is this normal? I feel more energetic after each workout. The only thing I take before going to the gym is a small coffee (without sugar/cream) from Tim Hortons and nothing else (I'm always fasting). I spend about 2 hours doing a full body workout. Why do I feel more energetic after I'm done? I started doing deadlifts but I could keep on doing it for as long as 7 sets. I'd only need to take about 30 seconds rest before I'm ready again. Increasing the weight didn't have any effect. As long as I can lift it from the ground, I can do Multiple sets with 5-9 reps. Is this okay/normal? I've asked people to check my form and they said it's fine (I also don't feel any pain after doing deadlifts)   I'm a male, 18 years, 5'6, annoying stomach fat(around 17%), 153lbs  Thank you.  "
3029,Touching weight stack on every rep,"I heard that in one set (12 reps) using weight machine, you shouldn't make the weight to touch the stack (that is, it must remain ""floated"") every rep. Is it true? What's the reason? "
3030,Should I use workout supplements to decrease food amounts?,"Some background:  I have been working out in the gym for more than a year now after previous experience of 3 years during high-school. Also I have been running for 9 years, used to run half a marathon some 5 years back from now. I am 29, 1.83 meter (6 foot), 86 kg (200 pound), about 15 percent body fat.  I started with free weights in the 18+ rep range (due to an injury) and gradually moved to the 4-8 rep range, also I incorporate a lot of body-weight exercises. Now I do strength training for 2-3 times a week for about 90 min (including warm-up and stretching), everything is in super-sets, and run 2-3 times a week for 30 min, mostly high intensity interval running.  My goal is strength, calisthenics skill, and overall fitness and health.  I do not take any supplements except from an sports drink (Isostar).   So far I improved strength and physique and mastered some difficult calisthenics exercises, added about 8 kg (~17 pounds) while remaining lean, and I am happy with my progress.  The problem I am facing:  I am consuming large and growing amounts of food. I am not stuffing myself forcefully, I actually have an insane appetite, and it takes a lot of food to satisfy it. I eat healthy whole foods most of the time.  This has literally became a time and energy consuming issue, I have to cook a lot, when I take food with me during the day it usually wont suffice and I buy some extra. And when I finally feel full I usually consumed so much that it makes me tired and heavy. Preparing and eating lots of small meals isn't an option due to time shortage. Also my metabolism send's me to the bathroom after each meal I consume, so you can understand why I am not excited about eating many small meals.  I am sure that this appetite is a result of training, because it usually lasts 3 days after the last workout. If I stop training, after about 5 days my appetite decreases and I eat half the food I usually do.  The question:  Will supplementing some of my food intake with a workout supplement allow me to decrease the amount of food I have to consume daily?  Would you advice to do so?  I would like to drink something that has high nutritional value and eat reasonable amounts of food.  Also, will I have to drink it for a few days after exercising, or just after my workout? "
3031,Posture and appearance,"5’11, 140lbs male.  Rounded and lowered shoulders, rounded upper back, slightly forward neck.  Light Scoliosis and moderate pectus carinatum.  Fall asleep on side, then sleep on stomach.  Many hours spent at desk.  What regimen should I follow to fix my posture?  I’m looking for something sort of step by step that I can mindlessly follow to get proper posture back. I am able to have proper posture but cannot keep it for long, I don’t have the strength for it. Is it possible to perhaps tighten up back muscles enough that everything reverts back on its own?  My hope one day is to actually look fit, and I figure a good first step is fixing posture. "
3032,Most efficient way to stand?,"A question out of curiosity. What's the best way to stand in one place for a long time, say an hour? ""Best"" in terms of energy consumption; but mainly ankles, knees and muscle fatigue. Stand evenly on both feet? Or shift most of your weight on one foot in turns? Is there some ""optimal"" foot alignment?  I'm asking both for answers from experience and a theoretical explanation what and why :)  Update: not required to stand still. If you want to be precise, assume you can use no more than a square meter of floor, as long as you're standing the whole time. "
3033,Is it Necessary to Make Noise While Deadlifting Or Wear A Belt,"Background  I've been deadlifting for about a year at home and have managed to have a 1RM of 405 lbs (more than twice my body weight). Because I had no intention of disturbing my downstairs neighbors, I never drop the weights; I always put it down carefully. Obviously, this was very tasking for me (and I think it contributed to my low number)  Fast Forward  I now train in a commercial gym with a free weights section. My observation of most patrons deadlifting are:    A lot of them drop the weights after lifting. This causes some noise. For some, the noise is so annoying that other patrons usually avoid all the machines around the area. Weirdly enough, the gym employees don't seem to complain. So, on one of my sessions, I decided to drop the weights; (I guided it down, but not as I used to do at home). Unsurprisingly, I wasn't as tired as I used to be. Because I'm unfamiliar with the noise, I had to put some rubber mats under the weights to reduce the noise made. More than half of the deadlifting/squats patrons use a belt. They are using belts for low weights (less than 200 lbs for squats, 250 lbs for deadlifts). Because I began deadlifting with the StrongLifts program where using belts was discouraged (unless you're lifting about 1.5 times your body weight) because it allows patrons to use bad form, I usually feel like talking to the patrons.   Questions    First, is it possible to efficiently deadlift without dropping the weights? I don't want to be that guy who makes noise (or damages equipment)  Second, is there a good reason to wear belts while deadlifting/squatting with low weights? I was fortunate to have a good foundation when I started and this site also helped me a lot. So, if there's no benefit for them, I don't mind talking to some of them about it.  "
3034,Vegan trying to build muscle: how much protein should I eat and how can I get it?,"First I want to say I know absolutely nothing about food or nutrition. So please write in terms I can understand.  I am 18 years old and I exercise in order to help in building muscle. My weight is 53 killograms. I am also a vegan (well actually a vegetarian since I do eat some milk and eggs, but little so most of my protein I get from plants). I know that in order to build muscle, I have to get enough protein.  I'm able to get protein from foods like beans, lentils, nuts, (I think) grains.  However I'm really not sure how much daily protein is plenty enough to help build muscle. I'm also not sure how much vegan food I need to eat daily in order to get this amount of protein.  Some numbers will be very helpful:    What is the amount of protein I need to eat daily in order to help build muscles? What vegan foods can I eat that have plenty of protein, and how much of these foods should I eat daily in order to build muscle?   In terms of amounts, I'm really not sure what I'm doing. So help will be great. Thanks "
3035,"When stretching my forearm extensors, should I clench my fist?","I stretch my forearm extensors as follows:    Sometimes I use a bed/chair/etc. instead of using my other arm to perform the stretch, e.g.:    Should I clench my fist when doing such stretches?  If so, should I clench my fist in a specific way, e.g.    ? "
3036,Snatch-grip Shoulder Rotation,"When completing a snatch how should one be tensing/controlling their back/shoulders?  Should I be looking to inwardly rotate (bend the bar so the plates would end up in front of me? Or should it be the opposite, pushing elbows backwards?  Should I be trying to shrug up or down in the receiving position?  "
3037,Using a stopwatch for intervals,"I have a 30 lap/split memory stopwatch that I got for doing sprints. I thought it would be a little more intuitive, but it doesn't look like stopwatches are really meant to capture what I'm trying to do?  I simply want to capture only my sprint time as individual laps. Not as cumulative time. I don't care about my total time or distance. So when I go back into memory I can see my sprints back to back so I can improve the next time around.  Right now the only way I can do is is kinda a ""hack""  Set it to Lap Mode:  Hit Start --> Run my sprint --> Hit Lap/Reset --> Lap 1 clocked at 02""30 --> Immediately Hit Start/Stop --> Lap 2 clocked at 00""20  After I do this, all I have to do is hit Start/Stop and it will start tracking my sprints as I want. But is there a way to do this without going through this ""bogus"" Lap 2? (I listed in bold)  Does that make sense? Am I asking too much from my stopwatch? I'm completely amateur to track/field so I'm not particularly sure how the professionals do it without bringing a friend and a clipboard. "
3038,Shoulders and lats give up before abs during hanging leg raises,"I've already mastered leg raises on the floor and I was advised to progress to a harder variation of leg raises which is the hanging knee raises. The problem is that my shoulders and lats give up before my abs do. So, after about 8 reps of hanging knee raises I give up due to pain in my shoulders and lats despite keeping my shoulders tight.   I can't do pull ups yet but I'm working on it. Can the lack of strength in my lats and biceps cause this issue ? and if not, then, What causes this pain and how can I overcome this issue ? "
3039,How do I correlate pace and walk run ratios?,"I do not understand what pace is and how that relates to run/walk ratios.  For example, On Jeff Galloway's site,     8:00                4 min      30 sec (or 2/15)   Does that mean if I can already run an 8 minute mile that I do run 4, walk 30?  Ok.  But what if I can do run 4 walk 1 (or 30sec), but my pace isn't 8 min. a mile.  I guess I'm saying, if I can run for four minutes and walk one and then run four  again, all without bad fatigue, over-training, injury, out of breath, etc., but, my pace is not an 8-minute mile, what am I really accomplishing?  Am I ""doing it wrong""?  My time ends up being 39 for a 5k at 4/1 or 12:33 a mile.  I really don't want to do,      12:15-14:30    30/30 or 20/20 or 15/15   I feel like all the benefits of cardio and weight loss go away.  No proof, just mental.  I feel no need to stop the run/walk method, nor do I want to get to the full run without the walk, but I still don't know what I'm getting here with 4/1.  I would like to do more than a 5k, eventually.  I'm just doing 4/1 because I can. "
3040,Is it normal to have heart palpitations in colder weather?,"I am moderately active, normal blood pressure, fairly average weight and build.  I've noticed that when I'm running in cold weather, about 5-10 minutes into my run I start to get what feel like heart palpitations, a somewhat uncomfortable but not painful fluttery feeling in my chest.  I don't get dizzy or anything, and am able to run normally, but I usually stop for a few minutes so I can make sure everything is ok.  I have had similar experiences when I used to work in a chilly building (65-68F) all day then walk out in the summer air (>95F).  For the first few minutes I'd get the feeling my heart wasn't beating fast enough, and it had the same fluttery feeling, but once I take a few breaths and give it a few minutes, things seem to normalize.    Why would this be happening?  Do I have bradycardia?  Could this be dangerous? "
3041,Leg hurts during side star plank,"I am trying to achieve a side star elbow plank. I am quite adept at the regular elbow plank (5 mins) and side planks (1.5 minutes). However, I can not even hold a side star plank for 10 seconds. It is physically almost impossible to keep my leg up in the air. Rather quickly I get pain on the side of my leg and the lower part of the glutes (perhaps gluteus maximus or obturator interanus) that makes it difficult to do.  I have strengthened those muscles a lot with high resistance biking and squats.  What is going on that is making it difficult for me to do a side star plank? Is this normal? How can I strengthen my leg so it can do this better? "
3042,Why I never feel DOMS on my abs?,"I'm doing pretty good exercises for my abs, but i never feel the usual pain i feel when i exercise other muscles, why ? And does this mean I'm not having progress or not doing enough ? I like to feel this pain and would like to feel it on abs too "
3043,Push-ups for stamina development?,"Can push-ups be used to develop stamina? For instance, could a trainee use them like running for the lower body, like doing push-ups for an hour without rest?  The physical workers that work all day round with their hands, such as blacksmiths, are known for their strong hands. They also have high stamina in their upper bodies. I'd probably be exhausted after 10 minutes if I did what they do. I get tired quickly when carrying something heavy in my hands, yet I've seen tradeswomen carrying about 20kg in each hand for kilometers. So my hands definitely require strengthening.  So would it be a good idea to do as many push-ups as possible to develop upper-body stamina? I can't imagine doing 1000 push ups at the moment, but many people don't imagine even fast walking for over an hour. "
3044,Arm goes numb during chair dips?,"I have an issue where my arms go sorta tingly and numb after about 25 chair dips. I can still do reps afterward (have gone up to 42) however my arms feel really weird doing it. Nothing like they normally do after I am getting tired from push ups.  It is worth noting that that point of 25 has been slowly going higher, but at a much slower rate than my maximum reps is going up.  What could be going on here? How can I make it better? "
3045,Right way to calculate calories loss while dieting and exercising,"I am 48, male, 5 foot 9 inches tall, and weigh around 99 kg (so yes, obese).  I am a little confused by the way to determine what weight I should be losing in a week or a month.  Based on my age, weight, and height I have a BMR of around 1900 (while lying in bed) and I walk around 50-60 miles a week at around 3.5 MPH ...  My diet is around 2100 calories a day including everything...  Now if I multiply the 1975 * 1.55 I get around 3100, so I should be down by about 1000 calories a day, or 7000 calories a week, which means I am losing 2 lb a week just i my diet...  But do I also factor in the basic 100-120 calories burnt per mile walking, which would be around 7000 a week?  If that's the case I should be losing around 3-4 pounds a week.  Is that right, or do I need to be more flexible, and not worry so much about the numbers, just keep at it for 13 weeks and see where I am? "
3046,Purpose of rectus abdominis training,"It looks like the rectus abdominis plays a role in posture and contributes a bit towards increasing intra-abdominal pressure (IAP). Also, it is used for trunk/lumbar flexion as well.  However, what benefit is there to having a particularly ""strong"" rectus abdominis? By strong, I mean significantly beyond whatever may be required for basic mere things like posture and the occasional sit-up (or crunch). I understand IAP can be quite helpful for lifting and handling heavy weights, but it seems it's the transverse abdominis that's much more important for that.  For example, is there any ""heavy lifting"" or exercise significantly helped by a specifically strong rectus (not transverse!) abdominis? I'm not referring to some contrived ""weighted sit-up"" or crunch exercise here : ) "
3047,Simple Starting Calisthenic Workout Schedule,"I am trying to find or recreate a simple calisthenic workout I got from Health class in high school maybe 20 years ago. It was a one or two page schedule that increased weekly (and possibly varied within each week some as well).   Exercises included jog in place, jumping jacks, push ups, sit ups, and chin ups, though there could have been more.   First week was very low intensity, something like jog 4 minutes, push ups to 10 or fail, etc. Times and reps increased steadily.   I vaguely remember it was a ""family exercise plan"" or something, and we did it as a family. Now I am trying to find anything similar. I don't really care about the details of the method, just prefer calisthenics and no required equipment, and safe for a third grader and adults to do. The only completely laid out beginning workout schedules I can find are C25K or are weight equipment oriented.  Is there a C25K-like thing for calesthenics? Or a one page beginners calisthenic calendar?  "
3048,Workout routine on caloric deficit,"I've been going to gym for about 3-4 month now. In my diet I tried to eat 2g of protein per 1kg of body mass, ~0.5g of fat per 1kg of body mass, and keep my calories intake >= calories burned overall. I gained some mass (both muscle and fat presumably).   The training program was mainly 4 sets of 8-12 reps, with following exercises(3 days a week):  1) bench press, incline bench press, crossover chest,     pec machine, dumbbell shoulder raises, barbell shoulder raises,     biceps curls  2) wide grip pull-ups, bent over barbell row,     wide grip lat pull down, seated machine row,     seated cable row, dips (triceps version),      cable rope overhead triceps, one arm dumbbell triceps  3) barbell squat, leg press, seated leg curl,     lying leg curls, calves raises, various abs exercises   I increased weights somewhere about when I could do 4х10 with current weights.  Now I'm going to go for caloric deficit (~300-500kcal) (with same 2g of protein and ~0.5g of fat per 1kg of body mass, but less carbs) to reduce body fat and keep as much strength and volume as possible. How should I approach my workout routine in this period? I suppose adding weight is not a good idea on caloric deficit? (I do realize my routine was not ideal from the start) "
3049,Skinny with a lot of visceral fat - how should I exercise?,"I am skinny (178 cm, 63 kg) but have a lot of visceral fat around the belly.  Should I bulk up first then worry about my belly fat? Or should I burn the fat first?   Ideally, I would like to achieve both simultaneously, but a bit of scavenging around the Internet revealed that losing fat and gaining muscles at the same time is impossible. "
3050,Do you need a trainer to be in good shape? Or can people really do it themselves?,"I know this question isn't too good, but I just wanted some insight.  Many people often speak volumes regarding how excellent some personal trainers are. I assumed personal trainers/coaches/etc. were primarily for motivation, and didn't make nor break any potential or results. I've played minor league professional sports and always had a coach to train with, but typically preferred to ""do it my own way."" I know this doesn't always bode well, but what's the idea?  Do personal trainers/etc. really help break past barriers, or are they more for motivation?  If you are already perfectly self-motivated and disciplined, what can a trainer/coach offer?  Assume someone with a good workout plan, diet, motivation, etc. What do they have to gain by listening to someone telling them to do what they already know?  Wouldn't that be like a teacher being taught by ... another teacher? Sure, one can always learn, but if you already do your own thing, what's the benefit in being ""trained"" when you train yourself already? "
3051,Would lots of walking allow me to lean out while lifting and eating a lot?,"Suppose I'm on a hypercaloric diet (i.e bulking diet), lifting weights, and I also go for a walk 3 hours a day.  Walking is not an aerobic exercise, so the ratio of glycogen vs fat used as fuel is very well weighted to fat. I'm not really sure about the ratio, I guess 80/20 as an average of the 3 hours. Now... walking 3 hours is quite a lot (this is a hypothetical case, you get the point), but I'm sure that I could estimate (with some error margin) how many grams of fat I burned on each walk every day, and if I sum up for a week is plenty.  My point (and question) is: Could this be a way (rather crazy) for gaining muscle and loosing fat at the same time?  I know achieving both results at the same time is not possible (at least in not overweighted/non-novice individuals), but I'm not sure what would happen in this case.  Any ideas or paper that suggests an answer? "
3052,How exactly does one execute an interval training properly?,"I'm curious how to best execute the two parts of an interval training session, as mentioned on Wikipedia:     Interval training can be described as short periods of work followed by rest.    I assume a constant pace is important in each short period of work, as is an exact distance, but how do you get to that pace as soon as possible, and how do you slow down quickly? What techniques are best?    I myself do the speeding up with a hop and a firm swing of my arms for the first step, followed by another firm swing with the arms in the next step, after which I'm on my target pace, more or less. I have no technique for quickly slowing down, though.   What do you need to do to maintain the target pace?   I find looking on my watch very distracting, but how else would one know if one's pace is constant? On the track, I know how many seconds I need per 100 m, and look on my watch when I pass the next 100 m mark, and calculate in my head when I should pass the next 100 m. Doing this math while a group of people is behind me, depending on me for running at a constant pace is somewhat stressful, especially in the first 100 m of a 800 m workout between intervals.   In the recovery part, is walking—as I see many of my peers do in intensive interval training—even an option, or should one continue running, be it at a slower pace? And if walking is a viable option, what would be the rationale behind that option?  "
3053,Difference between 3x5 Over head press and 3x12 shoulder press?,"I've been doing following the Push Pull Legs (PPL) plan, In my Push workout routine, there is shoulder press with 3 sets of 12 reps. However, the instructions say that I can alternate this with Over Head Press with 3 sets of 5 reps.   I know both of these exercises works my shoulders but isn't it doing 5 reps and 12 reps are totally different (I believe 5 reps is for strength and 12 reps is for aesthetics)? Why is the documentations have this option then? "
3054,Training Program to become stronger alpine Skier?,"I'd like to hear from someone who is more of an advanced downhill skier, like someone who has competed in slalom or mogul events, or is a veteran back-country skier.   Is there a template program you followed to become a stronger skier, something suggested to you by a coach or a personal trainer?   Is there a specific muscle group in your core or lower body you would suggest focusing on?  It can be either for moguls, slalom, glades, back country, whatever I like all kinds of skiing. I'm already a good skier, I just want to become better, and I think being physically stronger in the right places can help just as much as going out on the mountain and putting a bunch of hours in.   This is not a duplicate of this question which is the closest I could find, because this post just talks about someone with knee problems. "
3055,Cottage cheese and almonds before bedtime for cardio regemin,"I am starting an exercise regimen in combination of counting calories to get back to my ideal weight.  I am focusing more on cardiovascular exercises to shed the weight.  It basically consists of taking in 1500 net calories, in which I run/exercise off the additional calories I consume in a day.  I have heard that eating cottage cheese and almonds (or other nuts) within 1 hour of going to bed gives you the right amount of protein/monounsaturated fats so your body does not go into 'fasting mode' while you sleep.  However I'm wondering if this would be beneficial to someone who is doing mostly cardio without much weight training.  Are these 400 some calories before bedtime going to work against me?  Are there benefits of eating this before bedtime, other than making sure you don't consume the muscle protein while you sleep? "
3056,How do I squat if I can't keep my heels on the floor?,"I was told that I was doing the squats incorrectly because I was lifting the heels. I was told to try and do them without lifting the heels but I can't lower myself more than a few centimeters. The problem is not pain, I just feel tension in the back of my legs and at the point that the legs connect with the feet, but I don't feel any pain. The problem is that I just can't go lower, I feel locked there. I am young (24) and I haven't been diagnosed with any mobility problem.  There's video of me trying to squat. As you can see, there is a huge difference between what I can do with/without lifting my heels. I show as well the position in which I need to place my whole body to be able to put the whole foot on the ground.  How do I improve my squat if I can't keep my heels on the floor? Which exercises would help me the most? I am a gym member, but the instructors there are too busy to help people with particular issues.  UPDATE  First of all, thank you very much for your answers. I really appreciate people spending their own time on helping me. Thank you very much.  I have been reading all your comments and answers, and I decided to upload two more videos.   Here is me squatting with the help of a table Here is me performing the lunge test. I think it's a lot less than the10 cm that I should be able to do. Here's the result.   Do you feel discomfort, kind of like stretching between the top part of your feet that goes up by your tibia bones(on both of your legs)? That's exactly it. "
3057,How to maintain rate of improvement from light excercise,"Some months ago, I started performing semi-regular press-ups with the intention of building a bit of upper-body strength, endurance and tone. I'm 39 years old, and male.  I've been doing three sets, with a thirty second break between each, and a ""set"" basically comprising performing repetitions until I feel I physically can't manage any more. I've been managing to do this a minimum of every other day, but frequently I can do it more often.  At first I managed to push out sets of about 2-2-1. That increased very rapidly at first, adding a total of 3-4 repetitions to the total every week that passed, then the rate of improvement began to slow, which is to be expected  As it stands I can manage sets of about 15-4-2. But I've been stuck at around that level for weeks now, with only tiny, incremental improvements which often don't last (i.e. I manage an extra rep one day, and lose it the next).  Is there anything I can do to improve the rate at which I'm gaining strength? I want to keep this relatively informal: so no special diet or gym membership or anything like that. But should I being doing my little routine more or less often? Increasing the break between sets? Doing more sets? Or given my thin, wiry physique, am I simply reaching my physical limit without much more intensive training? "
3058,Overhead Squat Assistance Work,"My next fitness goal is 15 overhead squats with a barbell that has been loaded with my own bodyweight. I just went today and tried my first set. After lots of stretching and warmups, I did three pathetic work sets - 95x5, 115x5, 95x4. This lift is a hot mess for me. I feel great right now though - my back and core are feeling sore in ways that I haven't experienced since my novice days. I am obviously using new muscles to do this exercise.  Now, despite the fact that I can easily front squat 175x15, I can't overhead squat even 175x1, so there is obviously a strength gap between me and my goal, in my back and arms. And this is what I'm hoping to train with the lift.   But I think the bigger problems are related to mobility. The thing is, besides knowing that my upper back and arms need a better ROM, I'm not sure what other parts of my body need to be more flexible right now. So, my questions are twofold:   How can I evaluate my OHS mobility gaps? How can I stretch my deltoids, trapezius, pectoralis, biceps, and triceps, for this lift?   And any wisdom from anyone who's worked this lift is also appreciated. "
3059,"Generally healthy male, just had bad six months and now have chafing when running","I'm male, 29, 5'9"" ish, ~ 70kg  My normal routine is Gym on Monday (weights only), 2hrs Kickboxing on Tuesday and maybe thursday and an hour of (pretty intense) 5-a-side football on Wednesdays. Then I do what I feel like Friday, Saturday and Sunday.  I've never quite had a six pack but I've never been that far off. 6 months ago I would have considered myself in excellent shape.  However, I changed office jobs 6 months ago and hated it, had to work late, was a bit stressed, it was in a crappy location so I ended up basically eating KFC and Cornish Pasties for lunch, got in the habit of skipping Kickboxing and Gym (going maybe once every three weeks) and pretty much buying a big bar of Aero chocolate every night on the way home from work. This is on top of the monthly Kebab and Ales I enjoy drinking.  I've never had to worry about what I ate before.. I just needed to make sure I had a salad and some Orange juice every now and again to ensure I got enough Vitamins.  Anyway now, I find myself with a bit of fat on my thighs. You know how you enjoy a good stretch? Well, from Kickboxing I enjoy doing this stretch where I literally spread my legs as far away as possible and ""stretch my inner thighs"". I do it all the time, like waiting for a kettle to boil or just whenever. It seems now I've put a bit of fat on my thighs and they've started chafing. This chafing is causing me some discomfort both in my regular routine and tonight when I went out for a run. (I ran about 4 miles?)  It's ironic I've always wanted to gain weight but now it's gone to one specific and rather uncomfortable place.  I've quit that job and gone back to my old job for other reasons so although it's too early to tell, I think I've broken my existing pattern. I smoke and am capable (although rarely do) miss meals if needs be, but I was looking for some ""my-situtation-specific"" answers to these questions:   What's the quickest way to lose the weight between my thighs? A combination of skipping meals, (or eating only salads) and keep doing all my activities? I'm not an expert and I can't rule out that as I'm turning 30, it's my metabolism that's causing the slow weight gain. Any thoughts? Could I achieve the same results by say weight lifting more? Should I count calories, say, to ensure I don't eat more as a result of weight lifting and being hungry? Is it even possible to target fat in a specific area? If I don't have huge fat quantities, Do I have to lose my muscles on my arms first? What time frame is realistic for losing this weight? If I ran 3 times a week on top of my existing activities, could I firm up my thighs? Is there any other advice you could suggest from my paragraphs above?   I hope that I'm seen as overreacting but I don't think I have the same requirements of other people trying to lose weight? "
3060,Is this breakfast reasonably healthy (new to all this),"All, I have been trying to improve my breakfast situation from no breakfast or a really crappy breakfast. Because I changed by diet and cleaned it up a bit, I no longer binge eat at night. This of course leaves me legitimately hungry in the morning.  After attempting a few different ideas and taking into account travel and other factors I have found self made smoothies fill me up.   My question is, is this a reasonably healthy meal to have in the mornings? Sometimes I also add a slice of brown toast with some natural peanut butter if I am really hungry but on average it does me right till lunch.  Smoothie consists of:   1 small banana 1 handful raspberries 1 handful blueberries 1 handful blackberries 30g Protein Powder Mix 1 small glass orange juice  2 dessert spoons live natural yoghurt    In terms of my physical make up, I am currently 17st down from 23st. I work out 6 days per week, a mix of body weight training and jogging. My goals are simply to improve my diet in line with my exercise regime. Ultimately I just want to be fit and healthy, no specific training goals or the like in mind. My previous diet consisted of pastries and other fat laden goodies that shouldn't really be eaten at all, never mind for breakfast.  To the down voter. I would have thought physical fitness and nutrition go hand in hand? While I am new to this it does seem one without the other is not a good idea?  "
3061,"If I workout harder after a longer time off, should I decrease the frequency of my workouts?","I generally lift every 3-4 days, and run when I get the energy.  My lifting routine says to lift every other day, but I've never felt good doing this, and like I said, I throw in running as well.  I took a week off of lifting.  When I went back to the gym I had incredible energy.  I lifted more than I have in a long time on lifts I normally do, and threw in a few new lifts for fun.  Could this heightened energy after a longer rest be an indication that I should be working out less frequently?  Or, for maximum gains, should I stick to every 3 days anyway? "
3062,Strengthening the ACL graft?,"After an ACL injury, there are tons of exercises one can do, but almost all of them seem to focus on the muscles around the graft, and stuff like balance exercises, plyometrics, etc...  What about strengthening the graft itself? Is this possible?  For example, the following exercise seems to put a lot of pressure on the graft for me:  So, you lie down, lift up your injured leg, and you keep the position of your thigh fixed, and then bend your lower-leg up and down.  "
3063,Building a first-time workout based on my lifestyle,"I'm 6'2"" and 270lbs. I'm not all fat, for some reason, but I've never worked out before. I've just decided that I'm going to be joining a local gym and was wondering if there was a tool online that would build a 30 minute (or should I be doing more?) workout based on my goals/metric.  I found that Gold Gym has one, but I tried putting several different metrics and usually got the same workout ... so I'm not sure how reliable it is.  Alternatively, what kind of workout should I be doing? My goal is to lose weight and get healthier. I was thinking two 30 minute workouts per week along with playing soccer and basketball on a intramural team. Is that a lot or not enough?  "
3064,How long before a weightlifting session should I ingest proteins?,"How long before a weightlifting session should I ingest proteins?  I have read different durations as shown below, and I wonder whether the scientific literature has reached any consensus on it.  [website]  There’s very little quality research in existence to provide practical recommendations with regards to timing of ingestion of a pre-workout protein beverage, however use within a 30-minute window beforehand should allow some of those amino acids to be floating around in your bloodstream by the time you begin your workout, if the right protein sources are ingested.   [website]  Untrained men participated in a 10-week resistance training program and either supplemented with 40 grams of carbohydrate or 40 grams of protein containing a mixture of whey and casein. Half of the supplements were consumed one hour before and then immediately after exercise on workout days. The results were overwhelmingly positive for the combination protein group.   [website]  A solution of whey proteins was consumed either immediately before exercise (PRE; n = 8) or immediately following exercise (POST; n = 9).   Related:   Window to utilize protein after weightlifting? Best timing and amount of protein intake for building mass (the question is quite general and doesn't focus on the timing of pre-workout protein intake.)  "
3065,Does weight come off where it went on?,"Although we know we can't target where weight comes off, if someone gained 20 pounds of fat and then lost 20 pounds of fat with no muscle gain or loss, would they look the same as before? Could it go on the stomach but be lost from the butt? "
3066,"What can you do with ""running"" hand weights?","A while ago I asked whether it was beneficial to run with hand weights. As a result, I pretty much stopped using them, and forgot all about them. Today I found my old hand weights in my closet, and so now my question is slightly different - what do people do with them? Is there some kind of exercise that is widely recommended?   "
3067,How to gain weight? By higher calorie intake or muscle building through exercise?,"My BMI is 18.5. Age 24, height 172.5 cm and weight 55 kg. I am undergoing training for triathlon. I swim 3 to 4 days a week (6-8 km in 4.5hrs - 6 hrs). I cycle around 50 km a week in 2.5 hrs. I run around 5-10 km a week in 30 mins - 60 mins.    I read somewhere that on an average a human being burns 377 calories per hour while swimming, 400 calories per hour while cycling, 440 calories per hour while running. I don't know exactly the amount of calories I am burning doing all these. Invariably I want to gain weight to reach 20 BMI.    Should I eat food containing more calories? Or the muscle development in doing all these exercise mentioned will help me gain some weight?    Please suggest. "
3068,Coingestion of carbohydrate and protein before/during/after a weightlifting session: how much carbohydrate?,"I read on {1}:     It has been established that the ingestion of carbohydrate and protein before (13,14) and/or after exercise (5,10,11,13–15) inhibits protein breakdown and stimulates muscle protein synthesis, resulting in net muscle protein accretion during recovery.   and {2}:    I know that the protein intake should be around 25g immediately after exercise. How much carbohydrate am I supposed to eat before/during/after a weightlifting session when coingested with proteins to optimize  muscle protein synthesis and recovery?

3069,Cutting phase: indicators for muscle loss,I want to cut for a while and lower my fat percentage. As everybody I want to maximize fat loss and minimize muscle loss. Are there any warning indicators that my body is burning muscles instead of fat? What is the best way to avoid it? Should I eatless proteins than in bulking phase? Should I keep doing the same strength exercises with the same weight? 
3070,Dumbbell lifts vs Smith Machine lifts,"The gym that I am a member of does not have any barbell free weight equipment, only dumbbells and the bar in the Smith machine (as well as other equipment such as cable machines, machines for specific exercises, etc). I realize that the advantage of using free weights over machines is greater use of stabilizing muscles, but I also realize that some lifts are much different when performed with dumbbells vs a barbell.   My question is this: Since no loose barbells are available, is it better to perform lifts like chest presses, dead lifts, etc with the Smith machine or with dumbbells? I already use the Smith machine for squats, but it seems very awkward for a lot of other lifts, and if it's not giving me the advantage of using stabilizing muscles, I'd just as soon use either a specific machine or dumbbells (both of which are in much less demand).   TL;DR: Which is more advantageous, the ability to use heavier weights in a Smith machine, or the added stabilizing needed for dumbbells? "
3071,Knuckle push-ups vs Finger push-ups,"I was wondering which one is better, knuckle push ups or finger push ups. I know that knuckle push ups strengthen your wrists, and finger pushups strengthen your fingers. But is it better to do them both in one session? flip-flop between them (knuckle pushups on one day and finger pushups on the next, then knuckles again and so on), or doing one of them exclusively?  What I'm building up to do is  Diamond pushups  normal knuckle push ups  finger wide grip pushups   Any advice is appreciated  "
3072,Does faster heart rate always mean burn of calories?,Let's say I drink a cup of coffee which has strong effect on me my heart rate increases noticeably. Does that mean I would be burning fat even I'm just sitting? Does faster heart rate always equal to more calorie burn?  Seems weird to me because that would mean drinking coffee every day would make you burn many more calories than when you don't especially when you're sensitive to it. 
3073,Is it a good idea to do really a lot of push-ups?,"Is it a good idea to do really a lot of push-ups? I'm currently doing 70-80 in one series, but after long training I'm hoping to do much much more. Of course every exercise is good for muscles and helps to train endurance etc.   But wouldn't doing a really big number of push-ups (say, 1000 and more) have some side-effects? Wouldn't it be too much for the joints, for example? Or wouldn't the tendons in forearms be in danger?  I want to be strong and fit, but it first I don't want to hurt myself so I want to be cautious when it comes to intensive training.  "
3074,How to choose manual treadmill for rucking,"I would like to have manual treadmill at home for rucking.  So far I have opportunity to test only one model. The model I have tested has fixed incline (kind of steep one). The experience was really disappointing. There was some kind of ""difficulty"" setting. Almost any settings leads to need of sprinting (or grabbing the rails) to prevent falling off. The most ""stiff"" settings allow me to walk, but in pace much higher than is suitable for rucking (or even walking) at my fitness level.  Major questions:  Are the manual treadmills designed to be used for moderate pace walking without touching the rails?  If yes, then I have few minor questions:   Should I search for manual treadmill with adjustable incline? Is there some norm for difficulty range? Is the difficulty influenced by my weight? What other parameters are important? Anything else I should now?   Notes:   I would probably be happy just with ""walking"" if rucking would not be possible. Most of the year I weight 80-90kg. With rucking load up to 40kg, I should not exceed 130kg total. I know that it is possible to ruck/walk outdoors. I do that fairly often (almost daily). So answers about why I should walk outdoors do not help with my question at all.   Thanks in advance. "

3076,Shape up body with heavy weights or light weights,"I am now planning to go to the gym, I never did gym before more than a month.. and that was 5 years back. Now as since last 5 years I have ruined my body by eating junk foods, sitting in front of the computer (obvious, as I am a software Engineer), late night sleep and sometime eating one time in a day. My current build is:    Height: 5 feet 11 inches Weight: 74 Kg   I have gained little mass on my chest and belly too (15-20% fat). Now I need an advice how do I train my body- by lifting heavy weights or light weights?   Also, do I need to have supplements, protein shakes or organic multivitamin tablets?  One last point, when last time I did gym for a month I noticed that I have lost fat from my face too. Is that fine or an indication of malnutrition ?   "
3077,Is planking with a weightlifting belt beneficial?,"I have anterior pelvic tilt so whenever I do any sort of ab work, my psoas muscle takes over and I feel intense pain in my lower back. I have tried to activate my abs by planking but my stomach sags and I feel nothing in my abs.  So as a workaround, I was thinking, would it be beneficial if I used a weightlifting belt while planking to prevent the lower back pain?  My reasoning/theory is, if I use a weightlifting belt, it will bring my stomach in and as a result, activate my transverse abdominous which would prevent the back pain. Would this work? At this point, I am willing to get creative to activate my abs! "

3083,Is soreness after every single work out good? Or is that a sign of too much strain?,"I have been working out moderately for 1 years now, and the last year I have been training to develop more strength (~85-90 max weight, 5-3 reps range) but seem to hit a plateau where I experience soreness after every single workout which is fine but after 2 weeks or so of continuous training the soreness becomes excessive and it takes away from my enthusiasm and energy so I have so stop and rest a week so the soreness goes away and I can train again.   I still get results but it seems to be at a very slowly rate(it takes about 6 weeks to be able to add 5 more lbs). So my question is this a good sign saying yes my workout is being effective or is it a sign that I might be putting too much strain? Or is it cause more of nutrition and/or rest? Or is this what I should expect from this kind of training?    "
3084,Constant fatigue,"I struggle with a constant fatigue throughout my days.  I feel my diet is good and balanced, I drink lots of water, and I exercise regularly.  I also constantly have a tired and foggy mind, which is unfortunate, as I am a good student and plan on going to work with my mind.  I am still going to be fine, I just think I could do much better without this.  A couple things to note are that I recently (2 weeks ago today) stopped drinking soda and caffeine; I drank a lot, but 2 weeks should be enough that it doesn't still affect me, right?  I'm also not active now; I'm home from school for a couple weeks before starting an internship.  However, I don't think these two could affect it that much.  First, it's been 2 weeks since I drank caffeine last.  Second, I'm still working some, and I still feel this constant fatigue even when I am quite busy.  I used to struggle with bad insomnia (not so much anymore), and I am on no medicines other than Sam-E, which I take every other day to help with my mood.  I keep a consistent sleep schedule and sleep 7-8 hours a night.  Is there a vitamin I could be deficient in or maybe something specific I could ask the doctor about? "
3085,severe pain after squats,"I usually walk 5 km everyday and suddenly thought of doing squats without any warm up. I did 20 repetitions, 2 times, and never felt any pain at all. In the evening, I felt stiffness, but then, I was not able to sleep or sit because of that. It's been 2 days, and I am still feeling the same. What could be wrong? Are my thighs injured? Should the cramps last more than days? How should I handle this? I am not able to sleep, I feel pain below my buttocks, and I am not able to use steps. I am feeling really worried. Should i go to a physician? "
3086,How to prepare to run X km in Y minutes?,"My friend needs to be able to run 2km in 8 minutes for a physical test, and I found his current schedule to achieve that interesting, because i'll have to do it soon too. But I come here to see if any runners have a better preparation schedule.  If you know you need to run X km in Y minutes how do you prepare for that? I'd like a question that can work for many people. Consider a reasonable time   I would like to know about this too:   Metrics you use for progress(e.g being able to run faster without getting tired or running longer?)  Consider that the person have no previous experience with running, not more than the average 30min in the gym for weight loss  "
3087,Jogging beginner,"I'm not a complete couch potato but I don't exercise near enough either. I'm skinny and around 170 cm (or 5 feet, 7 inches). I would like to start a jogging schedule but I have no idea where to start and I haven't done it in the past. Also at what speed is jogging actually jogging and not walking/running? So my questions are:  1) When do i go jogging? For how long? How does this increase? 2) What distance/time ratio is qualified as a ""jogging speed"" ? 3) Is it ok to drink water while jogging? 4) Are running shoes very important to the jogging experience? Especially when you're just starting out and not doing it consistently. "
3088,Fitness plan for an achieving high school freshman,"About myself: I am a high school freshman and in the past months it has dawned on me that exercise is way to important to ignore as I did for the ~8 months prior when I was struggling with anxiety issues and my grandmother dying.  My dad is a Cross-Country coach for 20+ years, and his healthy lifestyle has shown me that exercise really helps with life's stresses. I began doing primarily running for normally 1.5 miles, 2 or 2.5 on a good day.  My issue is that my core and upper body strength is relatively weak, and this is one of the main issues I would like to work on this summer. The problem is, I don't know/can't find an ideal balanced routine for a high school student.  Who should I consult for a balanced fitness plan? Is this one of those things that is simple enough to be achieved by the fine people here?  My dad primarily just runs, He has a bench set in the basement but I have never seen him use it once. His advice for me was that most body workouts can be accomplished with your own weight (mines ~110 lbs), and after each run he does 2 sets each of: 20 pushups, 30 situps, 20 of something where you lay down on your feet and elbows, and the take turns holding your weight on each arm (its a core workout), and 20 lunges. Is this a 'good-enough' plan for a high-academic achieving young student?  I primarily want to exercise over the summer to be ready for getting back into sports next year, as this year I didnt do any due to anxiety, and presently ive caught up with myself after counseling and time.  One of my future goals for myself is to be able to run atleast a half-marathon before I graduate. "
3089,"Bench press grip, thumb placement","What is the best practice as far as the thumb goes with respect to the bar?  I normally have my thumb aligned with the rest of my fingers, but I often get asked why I don't wrap my thumb around the bar (and form a fist). They say it looks unsafe, but anyone who uses this grip knows that it feels as fine as the wrap.  Besides, if the bar is rolling out of your hand, your thumb is laughably unsuited to stop it. But this, as we all know, is generally not an issue anyway.  My reason is mostly comfort, as I haven't researched best practices.  What do you do, and why? Bonus upvotes for sources, as always. "
3090,The truth about calories from alcohol,"For the past few weeks, I have been carefully recording my food and drink intake, together with my exercise. I would say that my net calorie intake is accurate to within 100 calories either way. I have also been weighing myself at the same time every day, first thing in the morning after visiting the loo, and with no clothes on.  Plotting a graph of net calories vs body weight shows a strong correlation. On days that I have a calorie surplus, my weight increases the next day, proportionally to the calorie surplus. This trend is even more noticeable if I average the calorie surplus and weight over an entire week.  However, one thing I have noticed, is that calories from alcohol do not seem to particularly affect my weight, certainly not as much as you might expect from the calorific content. For example, every now and then I might have a big night and drink, for example, 6 beers. This is the equivalent of 1200 calories. On days when I eat that level of calorie surplus from food, my weight difference is very noticeable the next day. However, there is not a major weight difference after drinking this level of alcohol.  The best correlation I can find is when I only include the carbs from the beer. So, 6 pints of beer is 100 grams of carbs, which is 400 calories. Including this in my graph shows a good correlation, as with the food intake.  So, my conclusion from this is that the calories from the actual alcohol itself are not used by my body, but simply excreted. Only the calories from the carbs in the drink are burned for energy.  Is this correct? I have seen so many different articles on this, which do not seem to agree. Some say that all calories in alcohol are burned for energy. Some say that all calories in alcohol are excreted immediately. Some say that all calories in alcohol are stored immediately as fat. And all these articles claim that the other theories are simply ""myths""!  So what is the truth as to how alcohol is used by the body? "
3091,"Are calories burned affected by just work done, or also heartrate, weight, age, etc?","Let's say I'm riding a stationary bike with a power meter.  It measures my power as 200W and I workout for 10 minutes.  This is a total work of 120 J or 28.7 Cal.  Now is that how many calories I've ""burned"", period?  Does heart rate, age, sex, weight, temperature, etc affect this? "
3092,Battle Rope Workouts,There are two Battle Rope workouts I plan to do in the same session:    (Workout #1) An HIIT workout as explained here. (Workout #2) Strengthening the core by isolating it using these routines.   What are the benefits? What size of battle rope is good for cardio training? (I was considering the Onnit battle rope but it seems very light - starting from 24lbs.) 
3093,will i face any problems on body building,"I am 5.5 feet, 71kg, waist 32 and my stomatch is out. I recently joined gym and the trainer tells me that we will put on more weight on the upper part like on chest and biceps so when the biceps becomes like 20 inch then we can cut it by work outs and it will stop at 15-16 inches and will be very hard like stone. Is this the right way of body building??? Will i not face the problem of being over weight????  Will i get abs and biceps i wanted ??  Is trainer going the right way ??? Please answer me asap. I am really worried .very worried. "
3094,Where to store the chalk (magnesium carbonate) when training parkour?,"It's been a while since I've practiced parkour and I want to start practicing again, the problem is that I've lost completely my capacity to hold a good grip. I've never used chalk to practice, but when I watched a video of the ""Human Monkey"" I noticed that he had on his hands some kind of powder and a bag hanging from his belt. So, I was thinking that I can use chalk to keep a good grip, at least until I get back in shape.  Where can I put the chalk while practicing parkour? is there some specialized equipment for that? or would just a small fanny pack do the job? "
3095,What are some ways to improve muscle endurance?,"I have recently returned to the gym and I am trying to get back to my former glory (and exceed eventually). The big problem I see is that I can complete a set with full range of motion, but following sets are difficult to complete without using partial reps. Clearly I have strength, but no endurance.  My current focus is hypertrophy and I do about 10-12 reps in my exercises where the last rep or two are really challenging. Is there something I can do on top of my normal routine to improve endurance? Or is there something I can incorporate into my routine? Aside from just continuing the exercising until my endurance improves over time. I'm looking for something extra, if such a thing exists. "
3096,What are good knee strengthening exercises to avoid knee injury?,"I often have knee pain. I`ve been to the doctor already and luckily I don´t have any serious disorder. But I do need to strengthen my muscles around the knee to avoid injuries and pain. What are the best exercises to do so?   And also, in a related question, what are the exercises that I should avoid? "
3097,Proper hand placement for chest flys?,"I was doing butterfly chest excercise with machine as shown here  But, my trainer said I am doing it wrong as my hands should be straight when coming to front. While earlier, my elbow was bent when I bring my hands together. I was able to do 110 pounds with my prior technique. However, with the technique told by trainer I was hardly able to do 60 pound. So, if the trainer told me the correct form, which I think he did, which muscle was I training earlier? He told me it was shoulders, but, I have my doubts. Can someone clarify proper method of butterfly fly on this machine? "
3098,Squat Progress and Development,"I'm focusing on powerlifting and weightlifting. I am 59kg in weight. I am currently able to deadlift 170kg for 1RM and squat 120kg for 1RM. As you can see, there is a very big difference between the two lifts. Is there a way I can make my squat 1RM catch up with my deadlift 1RM?  While I have been able to add 2kg every fortnight to squats, I've been able to go from 160kg to 170kg in one week for the deadlift. I use low bar for deadlift. Why there is so much disparity between progress rate of the two lifts? I have been doing agonist-antagonist training using Arnold's program as my template for a year. However, I modified the program to 1-5 per set. Just that for some lifts, progress is slower than others.   For nutrition, I eat 12 eggs a day evenly spaced out in the day. I also eat 120g of protein from meat, beans, etc. I take coffee before every workout. Plenty of fruits of course, as well as wholemeal carbohydrates. Been using this diet for the past two years with no complications whatsoever.  My overall question is how can I make my progress for squat improve with the information I have given concerning my routine, diet and progress? "
3099,Is my workout complete?,"I read on this site that a full workout consists of a pushing exercise, a pulling exercise and a legs exercise.   For the pushing exercise I have bench presses. For the legs exercise I have weighted squats.   It's the pulling exercise that I'm mainly concerned about, I'm doing dead lift as I read it somewhere but after doing it for the first time I felt like the dead lift was more of a legs exercise. Is it an appropriate exercise to fill the ""pull"" slot in my workout?  What would be a pull exercise that I could use instead if deadlift does not meet the pull criteria? "
3100,Training for hypertrophy by increasing the work-out volume results in a muscle endurance decrease: Why?,"To explain the question, I must talk about two periods. I will be as brief as possible so that you will be happy to read my question. Then, at the end of this post, you will find the details.  First period: The highest work-out volume (per week)  I was training with a uper-lower work-out, using supersets for the poly and the mono exercises. I was training the back/pecs 2 or 3 times a week, and legs 2 times a week. Each set was in the shape of:     approx. 40secs under tension, with tempos allowing approx. 7reps ; then 15s of rest-pause ; then 20secs under tension (same weight), with tempos allowing approx. 4reps.   Exception: for the poly exercises, the last 3 sets were in the shape of:     approx. 20secs under tension, with tempos allowing approx. 5reps ; then 15s of rest-pause ; then 20secs under tension (same weight), with tempos allowing approx. 5reps ; then 15s of rest-pause ; then 20s under tension (decreased weight), with tempos allowing approx. 4 reps.   My back was trained  with 6 sets of vertical pull, the pecs with 5 sets of bench, then 5 sets of inclined bench, the back was traing with 6 sets of horizontal pull, the pecs with 3 sets of butterfly.  I don't want to detail my training for the legs and the little muscles.  Results:   Most of the time, I couldn't respect the above times under tension Several times, I had to decrease my weights. I never could progress in term of weights, hypertrophy, endurance. When I tried to increase weights, I had to decrease the times under tension and/or the number of contractions/stretches This work-out could be described as:   High frequency training High work-out volume: use of rest-pauses, use of [7 ; 9] reps sets, use of [4 ; 5] reps sets, use of supersets    Why work this way? Some justification is required....   Time under tension: the hypertrophy is maximal for 1min of time under tension for a given set: less and more are not good practices Rest-pauses spaced by only 15s: they allow me to increase the time under tension Doing the 40s at approx. 7 or 8reps and the 20s: I think it's the best format for hypertrophy (heavy weights + good sum of times under tension + correct number of contractions/stretches) Doing the 20s 20s 20s at 4 or 5reps: I think it's the best format for strength (nervous system) AND hypertrophy (since the sum of times under tension is 1min + very heavy weights). Supersets: useful to train cardio + on some exercises, it's censed to give more power (e.g.: legs press and legs curl: doing a set of legs press normally helps to do the next set of legs curl more easily, with heavier weights)   Now: The lowest work-out volume (per week)  As I didn't get any results after 1.5 year of training in term of hypertrophy and weights, I decided to change my work-out. Indeed, I thought I was not recovering, my work-out volume was certainly too high (I'm natural, not using steroids).   Now, I do a push/pull/legs work-out I don't use superset anymore I don't train my little muscles I train 2 times a week the pecs and the back, 1 time a week the legs I always begin my work-out with 10min of elliptical bike at high intensity and high speed (to warm up), then at the middle of my work-out I re-do these 10min   I understood that I should increase the weights after having increased the times under tension and the number of reps (keeping the same tempos from a work-out to another).  Each set is in the shape of:     approx. 40secs under tension, with tempos allowing approx. 7reps ; then 30s of rest-pause ; then 20secs under tension (same weight), with tempos allowing approx. 4reps.      When I reach the 40secs under tension, I go to 50secs under tension, with the same tempos than for the 40secs under tension (doing approx 9reps). And when I reach 50secs, I go to 1min similarly. Only after, I increase a little the weights.   This evaluation is done on the 2nd set for a given exercice (because from the 3rd, I'm too tired, and concerning the 1st: my nervous system isn't correctly warmed up).  Exception: the last 2 sets are in the shape of:     approx. 20secs under tension, with tempos allowing approx. 5reps ; then 30s of rest-pause ; then 20secs under tension (same weight), with tempos allowing approx. 5reps ; then 30s of rest-pause ; then 20s under tension (decreased weight), with tempos allowing approx. 4 reps.   I increase the weights for these last 2 sets if I feel I can do it.  I only do 5 sets for back for vertical, 5 sets for horizontal pullings, idem for pecs on next day (5 sets for pecs in bench, then 5 sets for pecs in inclined bench).   Results:   3 months I train like this... I'm still doing 40s max. with the same weights than the 1st month, with approx. the same tempos, the same number of reps (approx. 6 or 7 or 8 reps). No hypertrophy, no weight increase However, my work-out volume has decreased: I don't do supersets upper/lower work-out, just push pull legs work-out, the work-out frequency has a little decreased thus.   My question  Finally, as I wrote in the introduction of this post, I'll conclude the latter by giving details about the question.   First: what is my question, precisely? ===> I'm sure that the push pull legs I do, exactly as I've described above, is good for me. BUT I didn't progress in terme of muscle endurance.   Indeed, I stay at 40s under tension.   Example: at vertical pulling, concerning the 2nd set (the good set to measure my progression), I only do 40s of time under tension at 135lbs (61kg) with 8 reps (the last two reps are very challenging), then I rest-pause for 30s, and I do 20s at 135lbs again (3 reps). Another example: at bench press, concerning the 2nd set (the good set to measure my progression), I only do 40s of time under tension at 121lbs (55kg) with 7 reps (the last two reps are very challenging), then I rest-pause for 30s, and I do 20s at 121lbs again (3 reps). For these both exercises, from 3 months I stay at 40s.... I can't do 50s under tension with same weight, same tempos, and 8 or 9 reps......     So my muscle endurance doesn't progress. Hypertrophy doesn't progress. Also, strength doesn't progress (the weights for the last 2 sets of each exercise can't be increased).   I precise my question: given all these details, all these explanations, can you explain me why I can't do more reps (increasing the time under tension)? Is this work-out volume still to high? How do profesionnals, YouTubers, Instagramers, young American athletes work? Perhaps I'm training too intensively! Even if this intensity of work-out has decreased since my first period.   Today, I had to decrease the weights at my vertical pulling (back) to train at 40s with approx. 8 reps: it's a muscle endurance decrease... I'm affraid of this...   Anxiety  I'm getting nervous more and more, day by day... I have some knowledge in musculation... I don't understand why I can't progress, and it makes me anxious more and more. The other practitioners of my Basic Fit do progress, not me. From almost 2 years, I'm still at 121lbs at the bench press, WTF? Even if I changed my work-out (2nd period is lighter than my 1st one), I can't progress... "
3101,What are the rules to be followed while doing push ups at home,"Lately, I have started doing push ups at home. I have started this a year ago, paused and resumed it recently. In-order to maintain and keep of track of it, I am using an Android application.   Having no knowledge of fitness rules to be followed when doing push ups, often I get confused  regarding the position when doing push ups.  What should be the distance between my two palms when put on the floor? How wide should I keep my foot? I believe, I am not following this as I am dong it at home. Also, I am not using any equipment. I am just making use of my flat floor. How can I correct this and do it properly? "
3102,Is it fine to train in the sauna?,"If I train in sauna for something like Maraton des Sables, can this have side effects on the long run? What about steam room? By training, I mean stretching, push-ups, squats, abs - aprox 10 reps every 30 or 60 seconds. Of course the time spent in will depend on everyone's stamina. "
3103,Math for Calorie Deficit and Exercise,"Is my math right?  Current Weight: 158 Resting Energy: 1850 (roughly) Lose 1.4lbs a week)  1850-750 = 1,100  So I should eat 1,100 + my total active energy  recorded by Apple watch worn from wake to sleep as well as my chest heart rate monitor during workouts.  For deficit, looking for the highest amount that I won’t end up losing more muscle than fat if I had a lower deficit, or not being able to work out as hard and thus not build as much muscle had I had a lower deficit.  Yesterday, my resting energy according to apple watch worn all day was 1918. I burnt 1132 calories at a HIT class recorded by chest heart rate monitor and finally burnt an additional 695 calories beyond the workout and beyond resting energy according to apple watch ( I was very active with the kids most of the day, and building a home gym the rest of the day including going up and down stairs from the basement a ton). So for yesterday I should have eaten 2,595 calories to have a 1150 deficit correct?   On my Sunday rest day, only 1150 plus some light active energy, is quite low and feel the hunger craves, on the days I'm working out and eating like 2595 feel very full even though it seems the net deficit is the same so wanted to make sure my math is correct. Also starting intermittent fasting where I eat only between 11am and 7pm, since like most easy to skip breakfast anyway. "
3104,My anatomy: What exercizes should I do? Is there any YouTuber/Instgramer that looks like me to help me understand what kind of work-out I should do?,"Musculation should be highly customized, according to the anatomy e.g.. I've practiced for almost 2 years, without any result (in term of hypertrophy, strength / weights, etc.)  Below is my current shape. According to my muscular insertions, my muscles (length, shape, etc.), my bone structure (clavicles, etc.): could you recommend me some exercizes, or even a training protocol (I want to work strength / nervous system AND hypertrophy)?  Also, could you give me an example of bodybuilders, Youtubers or Instagramers of my age (15  - 25 yo) that had almost the same shape than me at their early stages? They'd be examples for me to follow.  [website]"
3105,Why do some actions benefit us and others injure us in the long term?,"I don't understand this very well. Some repetitive actions - lifting weights, for example - develop our muscles. And other actions can lead to long-term injuries. My old hockey coach told me how lorry drivers are often at risk of injuring their neck from the way they turn it every time they get out of the lorry. How does this work? Why doesn't the lorry driver repeatedly turning his neck strengthen his neck instead? "
3106,"Exercise Bike vs. ""Real Bike""","How accurately does an exercise bike simulate ""real"" biking? Are the statistics displayed on the screen realistic? "
3107,What are the benefits of performing the full motion of the exercise as opposed to holding it part way through?,"To clarify I'll provide some examples of what I mean by ""holding"":  Say when you are doing a situp, you can hold the position part way through and then just stay there and it will work your muscles. Another example is holding a dumbbell horizontally, or doing a chin up so that your biceps are approximately horizontal and then just holding that position.  Is doing exercise like this bad? Why is it never recommended to do this over doing the entire motion? What are the advantages and disadvantages of each? Are there dangers of holding? "
3108,"Losing body fat, carbs, diet and everything","I was planning my diet and something just didn't make sense to me. Most of the articles I've read said carbs are the enemies when trying to lose fat while much more articles also said carbs help to lose fat. So which is true exactly and what is the science behind it?  Another thing is this. I'm not sure how to calculate how much calories I need per day. I'm going with intermittent fasting. I'm on a one week break now but my job requires me to stand throughout while bending at intervals. It's an assembly job. I also workout 3-4 times per week (weight lifting and less than 30 mins cardio). How do I calculate it?  Also, I'm trying to lose body fat and not lose weight but most articles say ""take 250-500 MORE calories if you want to gain weight and take 250-500 LESS calories if you want to lose weight and take the needed amount if you're trying to maintain weight"". I'm not trying to gain weight or lose weight. I'm okay with my weight but I'm not okay with the amount of fat. Would someone explain this a bit more for me?  I'm 5'6, 155lbs, 17.5% body fat. I look skinny in cloth but skinny fat when I'm without clothes. I plan on going for a 40% fat 40% protein and 20% carbs and adjust every 2 weeks based on how my body changes.   Anything will be appreciated "
3109,Is there a maximum amount of stamina you can have?,"To give some context, I am a dancer. I need to be able to perform at dance competitions where our sets are at least 7-8 minutes. As of now, I can only dance up to 5 minutes, but my form breaks a little at the end because I get tired.   I know if I keep on training and practicing at my full potential and incrementally increase the minutes I practice for, then I can definitely dance for 7-8 minutes.  My question is, is there a biological constraint that limits the stamina a human can have? In other words, if I keep on training, could I theoretically dance for 20 minutes continuously? Maybe an hour? "
3110,How reliable are compact squat racks and foldable benches,"I live in an apartment, am in decent physical conditions, have done 4 straight months of workouts with dumbbells and body-weight exercises. I'm looking to move to simple barbell workouts to see where it gets me, including squats and bench presses.  Towards this end, I'm interested to learn whether I could store a squat rack and bench in the space I have available, and what options I would have for this.  I have found that squat racks exist which may be more easily stored than most, such as: [website]I'm aware that the highest quality equipment would be welded and not adjustable, but has anyone had any experience with this kind of equipment and can offer information regarding how safe and reliable it would be?  The same would go for benches, though I've only heard so far of benches which may be folded to be place under a bed.  If such equipment does exist, or the closest thing to it, and is reliable to be used for a beginner in weight training, where could quality equipment be bought from to be delivered to Romania? "
3111,Whey Protein Digestion rate? Am I wasting my protein?,"According to this site:  [website]When we take take protein shake in liquid form, it has only 1.5 hours to absorb and absorption rate is 8-10 g per hour. So in 1.5 hours maximum protein absorbed is 15 grams. They also said increase in amino acids level is 30%(without enzymes) vs 110%(with enzymes).  I can only eat 3-4 meals per day.Example my morning meal - I drink 50-60 grams of whey with oats(around 60 grams of protein).It means only 15 grams is absorbed and 45 grams is wasted(or used as energy).Should i consider taking enzymes?? "
3112,How much floor space does a basic multigym need?,I'm setting up a dedicated home gym in a room about 4x3.5m (13x12' approx) with a high ceiling. I'm interested in a multigym and two cardio machines (bike+x-trainer) but how much space does a multigym need... Not for itself but to enable it to be used? How much 'envelope' around it should be planned? 
3113,What do I need to incorporate into my exercise regime to have an as complete schedule as possible?,"I am obese (300 pounds now, down 40 pounds) and have been for the better part of my life. As I've acquired a great interest in medicine and sports medicine I've decided to shed most of my weight and get as fit as possible as I applied to medical school and got accepted (as it would be quite hypocritical to be a fat doctor). I have 4 months left till I start and I am aware that I cannot reach a healthy weight by then, but I'll be on my way there and I can handle a few stares.  This is my current exercise regime (I just graduated from high school, don't have a job so during down time from exercise I sit at home and read, play):  3x a week (mon, wed, fri): Wake up, do ""foundation training"" which includes stretches for posture, walk 3 kilometers (1.8 miles) to the gym, do Stronglifts 5x5 (squats, bench, deadlift, rows and press), walk home 3 kilometers. At home, do grip training.   3x a week (tues, thurs, sat): Wake up, do ""foundation training"", walk 5 kilometers to a place I like to do cardio, do couch-to-5k training (intervals), rest for a little bit on a bench and then walk home 5 kilometers. Total 11-12 km.   Sundays: Take a 5-20 kilometer (3-12 miles) walk depending on mood.  On top of this, when I'm at home playing/reading/watching movies I get up every 30 minutes to move for 5-10 minutes and clean the house a bit, get some water and so on so I work up a sweat over 8 times a day. But the problem is with the above training and standing up regularly, I still sit down for an average 8 hours a day. I have purchased an ergonomic chair and I've noticed that my posture is a lot better with my exercise (especially the stretching in morning, squats and deadlifts help a lot) but I still sit down too much. How can I change this? I've heard sit/standing desks are good, but I also need a new pair of running shoes now that winter is coming and I have to transition to treadmills and so I can't afford both.   Also, do I need to incorporate another exercise form? I've heard stretches before/after activity can be good but I feel that my morning stretches leave a great impact for the rest of the day.  "
3114,Palms hurt when I do pull ups or chin ups,"Whenever I do a pull up or a chin up my palms hurt, like where your knuckles are but on the palm side. I feel like it's being squished and stretched. After I perform a few, say 3, it's difficult to move my fingers at all for a bit, like it's very stiff in that position.  Is this normal for someone just starting out? (both exercise and these particular exercises)  I've recently lost a considerable amount of weight (~20kg) could this be a reason as to why my palm is hurting? I'm thinking of this because maybe the skin is looser.  Is there any way I can avoid this? I've tried wearing (gardening) gloves but it didn't help, it was the same.  Should I continue doing these exercises? Will it eventually become less painful? "
3115,How to correct muscle imbalance in front half vs back half of my body,"I have a 9-5 desk job and also spend large parts of my free time sitting down.  Whilst a small change in this direction is possible a large part of it isn't practical and therefore an answer such as, sit less, however correct, doesn't really solve my particular problem.  I believe I have a front dominant body, that is due to the nature of my work and extra curricular activities.  Many common fitness programs (starting strength, 5/3/1 etc. ) design programs whereby the muscles in the body are developed evenly however this will not correct an already existing imbalance.  I think that certain muscles in my body are much stronger than others, in the case where they should be equally strong.  For example I always feel my quads after squatting and hardly ever feel my hamstrings.  I am aware that DOMS is not an indicative measure of ""how well a muscle has been hit"".    But I find myself unable to squat with correct form, due to this muscle imbalance.  I can go to parallel but an attempt to go below results in form degradation where the bar tends to track forwards and up instead of straight up as it should.  I think this problem is due to my quads being dominant and taking all of the load instead of transferring it to my hamstrings and glutes where appropriate.  My quads also have quite bad static flexibility, I identify this because I find it painful to sit on my knees.  If I have this and potentially other imbalances as a result of my job, I would like a routine which helps me to address these imbalances.  It likely that other imbalances will exist which I believe are probably common among office works and result in bad posture.  Firstly is there some sort of standard test I could take (ideally at home) where I could identify what imbalances I have?  Are there any weightlifting routines such as 531 or similar which are designed to improve things like bad posture or a weaker back half of the body?  I would still like the routine to help me improve my lifting numbers and aesthetics.   If not how should I adapt an existing routine to correct any imbalances I have identified?  Edit:  I had a lot of responses to the first submitted answer that won't fit in a comment so I address them here.  I have decided to leave the original post intact but hopefully these edits will help to clarify the question.     Why do you want to go below parallel? Going to parallel is perfectly acceptable for squat form and if it's detrimental for you to go lower i don't understand why you want to.   When I said parallel I meant that I wish that my hip crease in the squat would go below my knees as described in this how to squat video by Alan Thrall.     How do you know this is a good test? Also there is no way that 'Quad flexibility' would stop you from squatting. If you can sit on your knees at all even with pain then your quads obviously have the range of motion to do a squat as that is practically half that range of motion of sitting on your knees.   I don't know it is a good test, but this is why I asked if there are ways I can test this at home.  By this I meant; a lot of people work desk jobs and a lot of people have a rather sedentary lifestyle.  I made a reasonable assumption that based upon these conditions many people probably suffer from similar bad posture problems.  Referring to the video I linked above, right at the start he states that     If you are not physically capable of performing a proper squat, your squat is still going to suck.  What do I mean by this?  If you have poor posture, tight ankles, tight hips and bad shoulders, nothing I tell you will fix your squat overnight. You need to fix your imbalances and improve your flexibility before you can expect to squat twice your bodyweight with good form.   (emphasis my own)   I was sort of looking for something like ""You can try these stretches or positions, if you can/can't get into them then chances are you have a muscle imbalance or something that will need to be fixed"".  It's hard to identify what imbalances I might have because I am used to how my body moves and day to day I'm not encumbered by a lack of flexibility.  But I am sure that the reason I cannot get my hips below my knees (I can make it level with a weightlifting shoe) is due to inflexibility of one or more muscles.  I thought potentially my quads as they ""feel tight"" but I don't know that.  I will look into stretches for my ankles and hips as you have suggested.  What really would be great would be maybe five or ten stretches / positions to try and hold / video, based on the performance of them / recordings it would help to identify / highlight where I might have muscle imbalances.       I personally think you're overthinking everything a little. A lot of this knowledge comes from time and experience. There won't be a general program(such as 5 3 1) that will address YOUR imbalances because then it wouldn't work for the general public.    True I could be, I used to lift and I haven't for 5+ years and during that time have been rather sedentary.  I used to have a coach but live in a different country now (or I'd just go back).  All I really know is that my form is worse and I am less flexible but I used to just lift and I am not a trainer.  I am aware that some imbalances I may have will be unique to me.  I was going off the assumption under which many fitness routines are published online and followed by many people.  That is, most people will benefit from performing these exercises like this, by doing so, the following response can be expected.   The idea was, a huge amount of people have muscular imbalances, and a lot of them (my assumption) can probably be grouped together and caused by the same thing.  It makes sense to me, therefore, that a routine which someone would run initially when training say to ""fix office chair posture"" would exist and I am surprised there isn't an adaptation in a program like (531) or others that starts with this in mind (given Alan's statement at the start of his squat tutorial).  I have little knowledge in this area so maybe my assumption is a massive over simplification it was just what I expected.  I.e. first couple of weeks focus on these stretches and exercises to get your body more attuned / capable of getting into positions like the squat.  I would view these as ""common issues"".     It's also likely that if one muscle is weak that the antagonistic muscle is tight.   This is exactly what I meant by my quads, they feel very tight and I am therefore worried that because of this my hamstrings are weak.  Really it was just an example.  To stick with this example, if my quads are tight does it mean my hamstrings are weak, is there a link or could I also have strong hamstrings and tight quads?     Another thing worth noting is that you could be wrong about your imbalances, and end up making them worse. So it really would be worth seeing a personal trainer or physio.   Yes for sure I could be.  Again this is why I was after some sort of ""stretch test at home"" which would guide me through some stretches and help me to identify these imbalances.     A point about the squat is that theres no real benefit to going below parallel unless you're training for the specific purpose of squatting really heavy below parallel   Is ""going parallel"" defined as your hip crease going below your knees? "
3116,Consequences of taking a break from training,I'm taking a forced break (about 2-3 weeks) from weightlifting after several months of training. How much are my strength and volume going to drop and at what pace should I start training after coming back? Also is it beneficial to keep protein consumption the same (2g per 1kg) during the break or I should decrease it? Can I use this time to lose some fat and go for calories deficit without losing muscles? 
3117,Question about DOMS,"I started going to the gym a few days ago. I felt soreness after my first workout and I did some research and found out that the soreness is a process that is needed for muscle to build/grow.i.e anytime I feel sore, Muscles are breaking down and rebuilding stronger ones. That's what I could get from my research.   Now, it's been maybe 6 days after I started going to the gym. I don't feel the soreness anymore. I've been going to the gym everyday (15 mins hiit on rest days) and lifting heavier than what I started with and yet, I don't feel any soreness.   Why is this happening? Is this normal or is my body already adapting to my workout routine?   Please note: a few weeks back, I went to the gym for about 5 days then I stopped because of a drastic change at my work place. I wasn't feeling anything at that time too after about 3 days.  "
3118,How do I increase my flat barbell bench press?,"I'm currently 17 and my friend and I have been lifting weights for about 5 months. My friend started taking these vitamin pills Dianabol, and although we use to lift the same weights he now lifts like 100lbs more. I don't wish to take supplements because I don't believe in them. Are there any training programs I can do to increase my strength? I heard Creatine is good but I don't want to cheat. I feel I eat a lot: I eat Kraft Mac and Cheese, Tyson Nuggets and Peanut Butter and Jelly, but I haven't gained much weight. Do I need more protein? "
3119,"Knee injuries, chiropractors vs doctors","One big issue with orthopedic injuries is that doctors do not like chiropractors apparently and never refer someone to a chiropractor. For example, the Mayo Clinic's informational page on knee injuries does not even list chiropractors as a solution type for knee injuries. They list acupuncture, though. That kind of shows where the average American doctor considers chiropracty: below acupuncture as a therapy.  So, the problem is that an athlete with a knee injury has basically two completely alternative approaches: go to a doctor, who will tend towards surgical approaches, or to a chiropractor. The chiropractor has the advantage that the stuff they do is not irreversible in the way that surgery is. On the other hand, an athlete that monkeys around with a chiropractor for a year, may end up putting off surgery which it may turn out is the only solution.  So, the problem is: how do you referee this? Basically you want to know, is this an injury that can be solved with chiropracty or does it need surgery? And just asking a doctor (in the USA) will probably not work because a doctor will nearly always avoid recommending chiropracty from my experience. On the other hand, the chiropractors are not able to read MRIs and say, ""this requires surgery"" either because they are not doctors.   Is there any kind of neutral observer that can make the right recommendation for either approach? "
3120,Do handstand push ups and pike push ups work the posterior deltoid,"I'm currently doing progression to reach the handstand push up. One of the progressions is the pike push up.

3122,"Skinny but flabby, what to do?","I appear skinny but anyone who's seen me without a shirt knows the truth!  My chest, arms, and legs all look healthy (as far as I'm concerned) but my stomach is this fatty mess.  It's not that I don't try. I run 8km every morning. I do burpees until I can burpee no more after each run. I love the simplicity of burpees. No doubt there are better workouts made up of several different isolating exercises, but burpees feel like they cover a lot and I tend not to get bored doing them and feel great afterwards.  I've been doing this for years, occasionally dropping one or the other or both for a short time, but always eating well. I walk a lot too. So the problem I believe is I have a weak core and none of these exercises are doing much to strengthen it?  Considering my current workout, what is the best and simplest exercise I should try to add in to start hardening up my core. I've incorporated standard situps/crunches in the past without much luck at all. I think it may be my sides (obliques?) that are in the worst shape.  I'd like to keep it simple and introduce only one, or maybe two, new exercises. At least to begin with.  Any advice on how to move forward would be much appreciated!

Another formula from Wikipedia that uses age, BMI and gender said 17.5%. I have a feeling it is probably over 20% though. The skin near my pecs I can barely pull away from the muscle. The fat on my stomach, and butt for that matter, I can grab and fill my hand :/  Caloric intake is around ~2000-2500 per day made up of vegetables, rice, beans, lentils, sometimes pasta, sometimes tofu, sometimes other things, toast, cereal. I am vegan and do not eat meat, eggs or dairy. I do drink soy milk. I do not drink soda or high-fructose corn syrups or refined sugars, etc. and generally pay attention to everything I eat.

3123,Feel dizzy while doing crunches,"I have recently started doing exercise for my abs. I exercise in following pattern  Do 40 Jumping jacks  25 High knees  then  15 basic crunches  15 bicycle crunches  10 alternate heel touches  I have started with small numbers,keep each crunch-exercise between 8 to 15, but I start feeling dizzy while doing crunches.. I want to do more exercise but I simply can't. After doing this minimum exercise that i mentioned above I am unable to do any more exercise, I have to take rest almost 1 hour to get rid of nausea. What I am doing wrong? what should I do else to get my body in shape? I have a big tummy and I want to make it flat.  Note: I take complete rest, almost 8-10 hours a day so there is no sleep deprivation issue. "
3124,What exercises can get the most benefit out of a short daily free weight routine?,"I'm about 5'10"" and weigh around 175lbs. Although I'm moderately fit in terms of aerobics and endurance, my muscle strength is poor for a man of my size. So I got a pair of dumbells and started working out.  My goal isn't to body build in the traditional sense. I don't have much time to work out, so I just want to maximise the number of muscle groups I'm working to increase my overall strength with the minimum number of exercises and reps.  I've got 8.5kg on each bell (that's all the weights they came with) and I'm currently doing:   Ten Squat plus press Ten rows Ten bicep curls Ten palm-up wrist curls Another ten squat plus press   I do this every weeknight and rest weekends. I've been going three weeks and it's already paying dividends: I could only do 6-8 of most of those excercises at that weight and now I can do the full ten.  So I'm wondering what the best way forward from here is. Are there other good - or better - excercises I should include in my routine for working multiple muscle groups? As the reps become easier, should I add weight or do more reps (I don't want this to take more than 10-15 minutes)? Is five nights a week and two rests a good routine? And I haven't changed my diet at all - should I?  "
3125,Leg Abductor Tremble,"Today was my fourth or fifth time using the thigh abductors at the gym, and since I began, my inner thighs tremble. I found a similar question here, which has a good explanation of the different muscles used for stabilizing free weights, however it's not quite what I'm looking for.  This tremble is apparently a normal thing, but when I use the machine, I don't need to do all the balancing and stabilizing I would without a machine.    Why does the tremble still happen?  Is there any way to correct this or does my body just need to become accustomed?   I haven't noticed any tremble like this on any other weight types I try for the first time, so why is just my thighs? Also, leg adductors cause no tremble in my legs. "
3126,Fixing Range of Motion Weaknesses,"This answer (regarding if partial reps are actually effective when the muscle just can't use full range of motion) suggests to use partial reps to target the weaker muscles and ""catch them up"". The answer explained that I need to identify the weakest point of the rep and do partials reps. This question aims to break down how I do that exactly.  Personally, after a set of bicep curls, I can't do a full set using the whole range of motion. Instead, I end up only going about half way (arm makes about an 80 degree bend). When fixing this with partial reps what should my starting and ending points be? The following are some options I can think:   Start with a fully extended arm and try to lift a little bit beyond my breaking point (~100 degrees) Start with a slightly bent arm (~45 degrees?) and lift a little bit beyond my breaking point.  Start with a slightly bent arm and finish the curl to the top Start at breaking point and finish curl to the top Something completely different.   Which option sounds best? "
3127,I have a back pain from sitting. Can I still run?,"Before yesterday and yesterday. I sat for long hours and now my back hurts me. However, I have a running schedule I must follow. Can I run ? or running would makes it worse ? "
3128,Is casein suitable for long hours of fasting?,"Say I’m doing an intermittent fast of 6-8 hours. What should I have just before the fast? The assumption is that casein will take a while to digest but will it make the fasting any easier? If so, how? And how much should be taken with the above conditions in mind?  The fasting actually represents the period of time in which I’m outside clubbing. So dancing, moving around, jumping up and down, and all that. So light exercise. Technically my Apple Watch tells me I burn upwards of 600 calories. I typically leave home at 10 and return at say 4 in the morning. The worst thing happens. I end up binging just to satisfy my hunger before going to bed.   What will casein protein do for me assuming I take it before going out and before bed? "
3129,Too high pulse while running,"I'm 36 so my max pulse is about 184. I'm a bit overweight, 98 kg. My problem is that I can't hold my pulse down. My usual pulse is about 148-154 (~80%). I'm not able to run slower. I would like to run with lower pulse, like about 130(~70%).  If I go uphill, my pulse rises fast.  I have no training plan, I just run for fun. I can run about 14km.  Fartlek or interval runs can solve my problem? Or what if I bike a lot in this lower pulse range? "
3130,What is the best way to breath while benching heavy?,I've heard both holding your breath for all reps and exhaling on the way up - what is the best approach and/or differences in approach? and are there other breathing patterns? 
3131,Machine's direction 'maintain certain speed' and calories shown on the machine,"I use one type of lateral trainer for thighs for cardio. The gym I go to have two such machines. After each minute or so, one of the machines shows me: 'you've to maintain 280 spm speed' (what's spm in the context of speed, by the way?) and shows a certain amount (say x) of calories being burnt per minute. However, I almost never (unless I push myself extremely hard), can attain 280 spm speed, I stick around 140 spm speed normally, which is just half.  Here's my question: since I'm sticking to a speed which is merely half of 280 spm, the recommended speed, does it mean I'm actually burning half of the calories shown? That is, is it really x/2 calories I'm burning per minute when the machine shows I'm burning x calories per minute?  And what is spm in the context of speed?   Thanks in advance! "
3132,Shoe lacing pattern to minimize Achilles rub,"Tl;Dr: what lacing pattern will help prevent rubbing on the Achilles Tendon? Are there other things I need to be doing?  Last week I bought a pair of Brooks Adrenaline GTS 19 women's running shoes (primarily for significant urban walking, 20+ km/day), and I'm getting rubbed on the back of my left Achilles tendon.   For the moment I'm protecting the area with a bandage but this is not a long term solution.   I generally wear Darn Tough brand crew-length hiking socks with CoolMax (I have multiple pairs). On days when I'm not planning to walk much I might wear name-brand padded men's athletic socks. I used to tape my blister spots as a preventative measure but now I sleep with lotion on my feet the night before a high mileage day, and often put lotion on the day of and the night after as well.   Returning the shoes is not an option. (FTR I tried on a half size larger and my heel was rising up out of the shoe.)  There are guides online for various supportive ways to lace shoes but none that mention Achilles rub as a goal.   I discarded my old shoes already; I I have a photograph of the lacing pattern but they are New Balance and I'm not sure I can exactly duplicate the lacing from the photo even if it is correct.   Some clarifications:  (1) Shoe models seem to change frequently; I've never thought it was worth looking for the same exact style as the last pair. (I've been wearing running shoes for daily walking since 2015.  (2) In this particular case I walked into an unfamiliar shoe store while on vacation after my feet informed me in no uncertain terms that I was overdue for new shoes.  The person who helped me said they had two styles in stock that might work, I tried on three pairs, and off I went.   (3) I've had Brooks before, from the Ghost line;I don't recall any particular fit problems.  "
3133,Is BCAA worth taking and what are its pros and cons?,"I've recently began revamping my supplementation. As of now, I'm only taking protein and creatin (although admittedly, I didn't really adhere to the recommended rationing / week plans of creatin).  I go to gym relatively often (5-6 times a week), so I got to know some people, who do body-building seriously. One of which was a qualified personal trainer and when I asked him about what should I add to my supplementation, he said:   Protein Creatin Multi-vitamin Omega3    As to somewhat of my personal surprise, as I did my own personal research into supplementation, the BCAA was missing in his list. When I confronted him about it, he said, that for a non-competing builder, the BCAA supplementation is completely unnecessary.   Which leads me to my question: Should I be taking BCAA?    If yes, what are the pros and cons? If not, and the trainer was right, why shouldn't I be taking?   As a bonus question, if you have any suggestion as to what to add or remove in my supplementation list, I'd be more than happy to know "
3134,"What can help me build muscle faster than diet, exercise, and rest alone?","I was thinking of doing an amateur bodybuilding show, but I'm drug-free and build muscle super-slowly no matter what. I am in need of going to a local bodybuilding show that I signed up for, but it's in four months and I'm looking to gain 12 pounds of muscle before then and lose about 8 pounds of fat.  I won't ever use steroids, but I'll do anything else that can help, as long as it's still not prohormones, HGH or SARMs. I gain only about half a pound of muscle a month, and I'd like to speed this up naturally. What supplements can help? I take tons of creatine but it unfortunately doesn't do enough.  I tried caffeine for heavier workouts, but workout intensity has no bearing on speed. I sleep 8-12 hours a day, and sleep quite well -- and this makes little difference. I get adequate protein, carbs and calories -- but it doesn't make a difference. I try different workouts and mostly only bodybuilding sets that focus on pump, intensity and many sets and reps -- but this yields no difference vs. any other regimen.  I don't want to show up and look ""small"" because people expect bodybuilders to have decent size.  How can I get as big as possible naturally within 4 months? I've heard of blood restriction and doing and workout out 50-100 sets can force excess blood to muscle which makes them get filled and huge. Also, I heard that you can take 200mg of creatine and drink five gallons of water and bloow flow restriction/pump creams that help put on size instantly. Do these help with looking bigger at least?  I'm lean and have okay size, but don't feel it's enough to be in an amateur bodybuilding contest.  I cannot back down from this. What are my options? 10-12 lbs. of muscle within four months.  I know muscle heals when not working, but I need this to be quick, like 1 day.  EDIT: I realize that 4 months is really pushing it, but I'd like to basically super-charge my progress now as best as it can possibly go until the show that's coming up. I believe there's something extra that can slightly help more than just the usual diet/macros, sleep and rest, which I have at the best. "

3136,"How Do I Prepare For Running In Very Cold Wind, Rain, or Snow?","I'm going to be traveling to Chicago, IL in early December and I'm training for a marathon.  What kind of preparation and equipment do I need to continue training while I am there?  I have run several marathons and I have run through the winter in the Southern US.  I am prepared to run in weather down to about 35 degrees Fahrenheit, with minimal wind, rain, or snow.  During the week I will be in Chicago, I plan to run at least 5-7 miles most days, with a long run of 15-20 miles one day.  Historical weather shows that the average temperature in Chicago in December is 20 degrees.     Should I expect to be running on ice, and if so, do I need special shoes?   If it is icy or snowy outside, do people just go to the gym and completely avoid running outside?   If I am running in ice or snow, is there a special method of layering that helps the most?   I have been planning to do my long run on the lake.  If it is 20 degrees outside and windy, is that feasible or will it be far too cold?  "
3137,What are workouts or stretches to increase flexibility for the splits?,What kind of workout or stretches can I do to increase my range of motion? I want to be able to do a split (I am quite close).  What kind of stretch should I do? 
3138,Does keeping your abdominal muscles flexed increase metabolism and reduce weight?,"I have heard that if the abdominal muscles are flexed deliberately (kind of forcibly) throughout the day, it increases metabolism and helps reduce weight. I have a few questions regarding this as I am trying to reduce weight:   Is it true?  If yes, how safe is it?  How long should I do it (e.g. the whole day or a few minutes each day)?  "

3140,Any negative effects from training all major lifts in a single day,"I have a workout split that goes something like this   Monday - Chest/Tris Tuesday - Back/Bis Wednesday - Legs/Shoulders Friday - Fullbody   On the full body day, is there any reason to not just train my ""key lifts"" e.g. deadlifts, squats, bench, overhead, pullups and dips?  Is there any issue with doing this in terms of negative effects on my body? "
3141,Time gap between meal and stretching exercise?,I always wonder to know what should be the time gap between meal and specifically stretching exercises.  So   After how many hours of meal I should not do stretching? And after how many hours of stretching exercise I should not take anything in?   Thanks! 
3142,Am I really training?,"I’m 35 y.o. Female. Exercise 4-5 times a week. Mostly cycling, some swimming and interval circuit training or weights. I do it all very intuitively. Not a program or workout plan. I want to improve my overall fitness level, so I  for a triathlon in October, and I’m sticking to spinning clases 3 times a week, but I don’t really know if I’m actually improving my fitness or if I’m just killing myself sweating it all but not really working my heart. I attach some screenshots of my HRs on the past classes.   Am I spending too much time on zone 5? Should I do more less intense workout? I really like to go an and give it all when working out, otherwise I get super bored.   Is it all I’m doing useless?  Thanks!  "
3143,Why do abdominal exercises have so many reps when hypertrophy exercises are limited to 12 at most?,"Whenever we want to build general muscle, we do at least 6 reps and at most 12 reps on like 3 sets, then why does abs workouts tends to be conducted to fatigue? (I mean 20 to 50 reps on 5 sets)  Isn't it faster to achieve failure when we are working our core with few reps and sets?  "
3144,What are post-workout l-glutamine supplementation benefits?,"This question excludes all possible benefits for the workout itself or exercise performance. It concerns post workout general well-being.   What does glutamine help with when it comes to post-workout artifacts such as recovery, fatigue, DOMS, and health in general? What about appetite suppression?   This question is assuming I do not take a post-workout protein shake and rely solely on glutamine.  "
3145,Why is cardio recommended besides weight lifting for good health?,"Current standard exercise recommendation (CDC, NHS, Mayo Clinic, etc) is: 75 min of vigorous exercise + at least 2 sessions of strength training per week.  I don't get this sharp distinction between the two, because what is strength training if not vigorous exercise itself?  I lift weights 4 x 1h per week. Taking away breaks between series, that's at least 60 to 120 min of vigorous exercise lifting weights. Why is this amount of time counted separately from the 75 min of recommended vigorous exercise?  I'm trying to understand whether it's possible to reach recommendations through lifting alone, and if it is then what's the minimum amount.  (note: I know cardio is good for health, that's not the point here) "
3146,Does muscle mass help or hurt for powerlifting and other strength sports?,"When training for powerlifting, olympic lifting, strongman events, etc., the majority of training cycles in an overall program would be focused on strength (myofibular hypertrophy) and perhaps power.  Is there any benefit to adding in a cycle focusing on mass (sarcoplasmic hypertrophy)? My first inclination is that it would just add bodyweight and bump me up to a higher weight class, but perhaps there are structural benefits? "
3147,Breaking Microtears by flexing?,"Try to flex your biceps as hard as you can. It feels like if you were lifting right? So does this mean that microtears are getting broke and therefore we are having the same effect as lifting(Muscle growth)?  Simple question but I was wondering this, maybe I can get out my non-lifting program, lol. "
3148,Accessory Lift Weight vs. Compound Lift 1RM,"Q: Is there an analytical relationship between the weight of your compound lift one rep max and the various accessory workouts of that muscle group?  For example, if I can squat 315 lb, is there a certain amount of weight I should be able to do on leg curls, or, leg extensions? If I can bench press 215 lb, what should I be able to move during tricep extensions or chest flys?    [06/07/19 Update]   I found this website: [website]I grabbed the standard squat weights for varying bodyweights at the different experience levels, then I grabbed the leg extension weights. Divided the leg extension weight by the squat weight and plotted it to get the following chart:    Would this be a valid way of determining the amount? Using their built in calculator, two reps at a 315 lb squat would put me at ""Intermediate"". So the chart above means I should be able to do 76% of my squat weight for a leg extension (240 lb). "
3149,Do people with slow metabolism tend to gain weight (fat) if they stop exercising?,"So, my height is 5'4"" and I weigh around 83 kg which gives a pretty bad ratio of BMI. My Triglyceride level is 238 mg/dl (desirable amount should be &lt;160), HDL Cholesterol is 31 mg/dl (borderline limit is 35-60), LDL Cholesterol is 89 mg/dl (Desirable limit should be &lt;130). My TSH level is borderline, which is, 6.72 μIU/ml (Among adults, it should be 0.27 - 4.2). My cardiologist recommended me a 1400 Calorie low-fat diet.  I don't know for sure if my metabolism is slow (naturally), but it is a fact that I have been obese since childhood. In 2016, I lost 12 kg of weight through diet and exercise. However, because of some circumstances, I had to quit exercising for over a year (almost). I gained whatever I lost through diet and exercise. So, I went to a dietician. She gave me a chart and she said that I should not join any gym and should rather walk for 1 hour, everyday. I asked her that why is joining a gym and exercising there a problem? She said, that people who unjoin a gym for whatever reasons, later, end up adding weight (fat).   Is it true? And if so, is it because of their slow metabolism rate or is it because they don't trim down their diet after unjoining a gym? I could not find any evidence for her claims, so any help in this regard will be helpful.  P.S. When I used to work our earlier, I used to do 30 minutes of cardio followed by 1 hour of strength (resistance) training. "
3150,How to maximize dumbbell workouts?,"So I do not belong to a gym, but my apartment building has a one. All I have access to are dumbbells that start at 10 and go up to 50.   How could I maximize my workouts with these dumbbells? I have done some research and pull workouts from Bodybuilding.com and just convert the barbell exercise to their dumbbell equivalent.   For example, I do dumbbell bench press instead of barbell bench press.   However I feel like there must be a better way.  Any suggestions?  "
3151,Does stretching interfere at all with strength gain or injury susceptibility in resistance training?,"I searched through the site and couldn't find a good answer to this. Does stretching (to improve flexibility) interact or slow the muscle building and strength increasing benefits of weight training?   Also, directly related, does increased flexibility increase proneness to injury during high intensity resistance training?   Referring to respected sources in your answer would be preferred. "
3152,is it possible to tone up even in starvation mode?,"Here's the long story put short:  I used to be (2 years ago) really big (13 stones at the age of 15) but now I've like completely lost it all (weigh 11 stone at 17). The thing is, I didn't lose it the right way, i starved myself instead.   I still look really fat (undressed) and I think it's because I'm not toned. I still have love handles and man boobs. My arms are really skinny, but thats because they get allot of exercise (LOL).   I'm still not eating much but according to my doctor, it's a healthy amount (over 1200 cals/day).  Now I think I'm still in starvation mode because i try to exercise so hard but i never see any results. I bike for 3 hours in the morning everyday, do 400 situps, and lots of planks.  My body is still the same, with some excess skin (I had loads of excess skin before but most of its gone now) but i still have man boobs, love handles and girls upper legs...  is it even possible to tone up in starvation mode? has starvation mode got anything to do with this issue?  thanks "
3153,How does one gauge progress in bodybuilding?,"On topic of bodybuilding, while there are many resources telling you how you should exercise, they usually don't tell you what rule-of-thumb signals and changes show if you're actually doing things right.  Let's take a look at these two example sentences:   After a year of training, I went from doing 4x20 abdominal crunches with 65kg, to 8x20 with 85kg. After two years of training, I went from 55.4kg with 7.8% fat, to 61.2kg with 14.4% fat.   Is there any way to take a look at these sentences and say ""these are reasonable changes for 5-day-a-week training regiment"", or ""you are definitely not training right""? Are there any rules-of-thumb that help making these assesments?  Or is the only answer ""you need to consult several trained professionals""? "
3154,"What is a good book for self-teaching, biomechanic and generally well rehabilitation?","Basically, I have lots of injuries and always get them, and would like to prevent them from happening again in the future, I believe they occur due to poor stretching or poor technique. I want to educate myself to prevent it from happening and do the exercises with the right technique. Is there any good book for self-teaching on biomechanics and just rehabilitation? Books that teach you to stretch probably and do's and don'ts. Good books on functional training?  "
3155,Ideal order and structure of routine?,"Some of the routines I've had have multiple muscles in the same day. For example: Day 1 has Chest, Back, Biceps and Shoulders while Day 3 has Triceps, Legs, Chest and Shoulders  I'm currently trying to improve and gain mass. I'm 68kg, 175cm and I've been working out for almost two years.  Maybe it's just my opinion, but don't the routines have to focus on max 2 muscles? For example Day 1 would be Biceps and Chest? Since I'm trying to stimulate those specific parts to make them stronger and increase (or make them bigger)  And coming to that, is there some way to do this in a optimal order? For example is it more recommended to work biceps and triceps together rather than biceps with chest? "
3156,How long can I fast without losing muscles?,"If I am lifting three times a week, can I have a 24h or 48h fast on the weekend (say, eat last meal on Friday evening and then next have on Saturday or Sunday evening)? Am I going to lose muscle mass because of this or am I safe and I can use this method to reduce my weakly calories intake? "
3157,Can tight hip flexors cause tight hamstrings?,"Today I noticed that when I sit like this:    My left leg goes comfortably all the way down, but my right leg won't. It won't go down past 45 degrees unless stretched. Does this mean that the right hip flexors are tight and can this cause tight hamstring and calf muscles?  What stretches should I be working on to release this? I've tried basic hamstring stretches without success. "
3158,Efficiency of my Workout,"I am currently working out 4 days a week. 3 of them I do weights focusing on different areas plus a bit of Cardio to warm up (20-30 mins running, spinning bike or X-trainer when I workout upper body, and 10 mins of those mentioned plus 10 mins of static row when I train legs). The 4th day I used to swim and run for an hour or so.  However,  I am trying to burn some fat from my belly and under triceps. I want to use this 4th day to focus on that purpose. I thought, in order to do that, do a longer workout, consisting on:  1) A 'long', around 45-60 mins,  moderate (60%-80% of MHR)  initial part, like running, cycle, X-trainer etc. That part would be after fasting to stimulate the difficult-to-burn fat. 2) A break of 10-20 mins, including a sugar intake (such as a fruit or shake) 3) 20-30 mins of a High Intensity Circuit to stimulate my metabolism for the rest of the day.  Can this be effective?  Am I at risk of start burning aminoacids?  I would be very happy to hear about other approaches to pursue my goal using that 4th day and any other feedback.  Thanks for your help guys! "
3159,Twitching/shaking after intense exercise? How to lessen it?,"So I am emasculated by the roid boys at the gym who can grind through dozens of sets and look like they're just starting their workout after spending days in the sauna. I often have to compensate for this by pushing myself extremely hard, which results in hours of trembling/shaking in said muscle group.  Don't get me wrong: it's not overworking because I'm still seeing results, but it's just unsettling to have to shake like I'm (no offense to him personally) Michael J. Fox. I know the shaking is a result of extreme nervous system taxing (and I extra stimulate my nervous system with lots of caffeine too).  It's also not just in said muscle area, but makes my whole body have spasms/tiny tremors and even mild eye/facial twitches for a while. This happens only after extreme exercising and usually caffeine.  I just want to get through a super-intense workout without having to shake as it greatly affects things like typing; sitting still without looking like I'm having tremors; etc. I just push myself this hard because I know that I'm comparing against IFBB pros without having to use the dope, and that's confidence boosting. I'd be highly proud of myself if I could reach 2/3 the size of those IFBB guys naturally.  I'd be even more ecstatic if I could do it without having to shake excessively after a die-hard workout.  Any tips? How to reduce the shaking/trembling/etc.? Assuming I don't lower-intensity of course. "

3162,Adjusting HR Zones,"Ever since I started using HR Zones in my training (running &amp; cycling), my fitness has been steadily going down. There is clearly something wrong and I suspect it's the zones.  I've done a climb recently, where I was mostly looking at my power and after I was done, my HR zones were like these:    Most of the effort claimed as Z5 is contiguous, like 30-35 min climb. If I understand zones correctly, this should not be possible, should it?  Does anyone else have experience with this? How do you go about adjusting the zones, so that they become useful during training? Is it better to just ditch the HR Zones and go off PRE, pace &amp; power? Most training plans are defined in terms of HR Zones, so it would be hard to use them if I do that.  Thank you. "
3163,Blood test and running training,"This evening I did a low intensity run (10km - 46'), a very easy workout based on my standard.  Tomorrow morning (about 12-13h after the run) I should do the blood test..  There is the possibilities to get an altered result due to this workout few hour before the withdrawal or not?  If yes, should I wait until the day after tomorrow?  I will do these exams:   Complete Hematocrit Hemoglobin Cholesterol LDL &amp; HDL Triglycerides  Cortisol Folate Vitamin B12 Ferritin Serum iron Transferrin sodium potassium copper blood test magnesium thyroid   I wrote that list because maybe there is the possiblity that the workout has an effect only on some tests.

3167,Ideal angle/position for arms and hands during pushups?,"What is the best position for your arms and hands when doing push-ups?  I'm wondering the angle of your arms, both forward (towards your head) and sideways (how wide to open arms). Also, should the hands be pointing straight forward? Fingers stretched open or close together?  I've noticed these all factor in terms of how many push-ups I can accomplish and the movement of shoulders and elbows. "

3169,Adverse effects from sitting for too long,"I have a desk job which requires me to be seated for a wall 10 to 12 hours each day including weekends. I perform only minimum amount of physical activities and excercise each day for about half an hour or so. What adverse effects can it have on my health and on my back in the long run if I continue this practice.   What can I do to minimise its effects  I have heard of a lumbar support, does it help ?? "
3170,Sleeping less than 4 hours a day?,"Six to eight hours per day is the average amount of sleep a person needs. That's about one-third of a lifetime! As a population, we sleep about 1 to 1.5 hours less than we did 100 years ago. Scientists say that sleeping 7 – 8 hours a day is normal. If you sleep less, your health can suffer. Sleep requirements vary from person to person and some people are naturally short or long sleepers.  There are lots of reasons to sleep and there are many people who sleep/slept less than 4 hours a day. Is this a myth?  What can happen if a person tries to develop a habit of sleeping less? "
3171,How to build a bigger and stronger upper body?,"I am a football (soccer) player and an occasional hiker. I am also a relatively new gardener and some of the works demand a lot from upper body strength. It seems to me that my upper body is really thin compared to my thigh (basically the entire upper body, from shoulder to waist).  I have a rather small skeleton in my opinion. Is there any effective way to train my whole upper body to grow bigger and stronger at the same time? If it is not possible, which part of my upper body should I train first? (e.g. chest). I rarely go to a gym or do weight bearing exercise on my own. "
3172,How do you know your overall strength/lifting level?,"How do you determine when you move from beginner to intermediate to advanced levels in strength training?  What are some indicators?  I'm assuming it's not how much weight is lifted, since that changes per person or overall length of training. "
3173,"When training for a 10K, is there an ideal distance for speed interval repeats?","I've got a 10K coming up on the 4th of July and have been throwing in some speed interval training over the past several weeks. So far I've been doing 1mi warm up at 1min slower than my desired race speed, and then 1mi x 6 repeats either right at or just below race speed, followed by a 1mi cooldown at the same speed as my warm up.  I recently read that I should try 2mi x 3 repeats instead, and that if I can do all three at race speed then I should be good to go.   My question is, when specifically considering a 10K, is there an ideal distance for repeats, either broken up by 1mi x some number or 2mi x some number?   Should 6mi be good or should I try 8 miles of repeats?  "
3174,How long can the work periods in HIIT be?,"Usually the recommendations for HIIT workouts involve 20 second high intensity work followed by an equivalent or greater rest period. Or Tabata, which invoves 20 second work followed by a 10 second rest.   Would it still be considered HIIT if you are working at >95% HR for 4-5min, then rest for a couple of minutes, and repeat for several cycles? I read everywhere that if you can keep going for more than a minute then it's not really hugh intensity, but what if my heart monitor marks more than 95% for a continuous 5 minutes or more? "
3175,How do I avoid secondary carnitine deficiency related to Valproate Acid treatment?,"I am on a regimen of 2500mg daily of Depakote ER, a Valproic Acid (VPA) derivative, and on a vegan diet. Previously I attempted to put the two together with the resulting fatigue and nausea (likely resulting from hyperammonemia) associated with secondary carnitine deficiency.   Mechanism  As far as I have been able to put together (please correct me if I am wrong);   VPA binds to and otherwise renders ineffective large stores of carnitine in the body and reduces the body's ability to synthesize it L-Carnitine is responsible for evacuation of NH3 from cells, and a deficiency leads to ammonia poisoning Vegans consume significantly less L-Carnitine in their diet, and, when coupled with VPA treatment, can facilitate hyperammonemia.`   Currently I am already consulting with my neurologist with respect to maintaining the efficacy of my medication, however I would like to find out more about improving my absorption and body stores of carnitine and staving off secondary carnitine deficiency due to the shift to a vegan diet.  Intake, Dosing  As such I have a few questions related to carnitine supplementation to ensure a healthy mitochondrial transfer process:   What approximate intake (mg/150 lb adult) is necessary to prevent hyperammonemia in a non-valproate treated adult (if any, considering it can be synthesized by the body as necessary)? What intake (mg/150 lb adult) is necessary for someone being treated with VPA? (i.e. what is the ratio of milligrams L-Carnitine displaced per milligram of VPA in a 150 lb adult)   Bioavailability  Since supplements are absorbed at a rate of about 14-18%, and ingested L-Carnitine is much higher, how can absorption be improved? According to one  study:     [B]ioavailability of L-carnitine in individuals adapted to low-carnitine diets (i.e., vegetarians) is higher than those adapted to high-carnitine diets (i.e., regular red meat eaters; 66%-86% versus 54%-72%) [LPI]    What complementary foods or supplements boost bioavailability of, specificially, L-Carnitine in the body? Does Alpha Lipoic Acid (as found in spinach) boost bioavailbility of L-Carnitine as it does Acetyl L-Carnitine?   L-Carnitine vs. Acetyl L-Carnitine  More than one resource promotes the combination of Alpha Lipoic Acid with the chemically similar Acetyl L-Carnitine in its efficacy related to mitochondrial health; the sum of the two is reportedly greater than the parts.   Is this a dead end or distraction with respect to treating secondary carnitine deficiency related to VPA treatment? Is substituting Acetyl L-Carnitine effective for L-Carnitine supplementation since the two can be converted back and forth? ALC is typically more expensive than LC, so it would be especially helpful to know if it would be more effective.     Per the concern regarding answering this question related to its specificty and scope:  I would like to encourage that information is put forward. The criteria for usefulness (up-voting) would be any researched answer to any one or more of the above questions. Usefulness need not be comprehensive, just informative regarding the admittedly specialized questions below. "
3176,How to reduce legs muscle in MENS,"I am looking for advise on how to reduce legs mass, not necessarily fat but muscle weight. Trying to achieve slimmer thighs and butt through muscle reduction.  Is running the best method? And if so, are higher intensity (speed) sessions recommended or low intensity and longer sessions? "
3177,"Is it a myth to wait before eating, after workout, due to Krebs Cycle?","The Krebs cycle is a series of chemical reactions, which is used by living organisms to generate energy through the oxidization of acetate derived from carbohydrates, fats and proteins into carbon dioxide and water.   Let's not go into the details about how the Krebs cycle works. I once read somewhere (do not recall where) that waiting at least 2 hours after the workout will have some advantages.  Is this a stupid thing?  EDIT:  The Krebs cycle works on aerobic state. Because it needs oxygen, during a running workout, it works (I think) only running at a low intensity, because if I run faster and the intensity grew, there will be others chemical reactions.  So let's assume I have just finished a low intensity running workout and my goal is fat loss.  Will I have some advantages by waiting a certain amount of time before I eat, or will I not?  If, on the other hand, my goal is muscle gain, do I need to have the same behavior? "
3178,How to target the upper middle / inner part of the chest?,What exercises can you do to target the upper middle/inner part of the chest? Is it as simple as doing incline chest press? 
3179,Does food temperature affect absorption time and efficieny?,"If I consume equal amounts of (say) mango, one in frozen chunks, the other at room temperature, will I digest them at different speeds? That is, will they have a different impact on my blood sugar levels, thereby having weight-control implications or being readily available for energy?   Following from the same, will heating beverages affect absorption rate? "
3180,How can I train legs when I have hip dysplasia?,"How can I make my legs stronger when I have hip dysplasia on both sides?  If I google ""legs training"", every search result states training will include a lot of variants of squatting. And they say, squatting is the base and a must have exercise.  But squatting is not allowed for me because of my illness, as well as any other axial load on the hips.  But, I really want to make my legs stronger. And, this is important: I want them strong, not big like a bodybuilder.   So, is there any way to substitute forbidden exercises? For example, it looks like squats train a group of muscles. One of them is gluteus maximus. Google says bridge exercise train this muscle. Another one is quadriceps. Exercise bike and such exercise device train quadriceps. And so on, and so on for every muscle from those, which squats train...  So... Is it possible to compose a training program, which will train my legs without squatting? And is it OK to do more exercises and spend more time, then as for a usual program? Or, maybe, squatting gives some special effect, which cannot be replaced by some other exercise? "
3181,Is it preferrable to run on toes?,Today I ran (slowly) on toes (300 small steps). I got tired very soon. I heard that skipping rope gives better results if done on toes (calf exercises)!    Is the same true with running too? Should I stop when the toes get tired (even when the body doesn't)? 
3182,Preserve muscles while fasting,"Within 10 days, the fasting month of muslims will start ( Ramadan Month). In this month muslims  fast all the day( not eating or drinking from morning till the sun set). So in such a case what is the best way to preserve muscles ?   I did  some search in previous  questions, where the discussion was how to preserve muscles while loosing weight. The idea was to eat enough protien ( 1.5 x body weight in Kg), keep  working out, and have calorie in &lt; calorie out.  Should some thing similar be for the case of fasting ? Especially that  the principal meal  will be the dinner taken after sunset.    Note: Living in a country where the sun rise at  6:30 am and the sunset at  10:00pm, this will count about 16 hours of fasting.  Thank you for any suggestion, article, reference, or answer  about the subject.  "
3183,How to calculate the Ideal Weight?,"I found some formulas based on height only (like Devine, Robinson, Miller), but I want to calculate the ideal weight based on gender, age and height.  Is it possible?  If so, which formulas are there and how do I use them? Or are there other ways of determining the ideal weight? "
3184,How should I change my diet when switching between exercises?,"I have been a runner/cyclist for the past six years.  To help fuel my body I've been maintaining a high protein, high carb diet, gotten almost entirely from fruits, vegetables, and seafood.    Due to an injury, I won't be able to bike or run much for the next six months.  Following a suggestion, I've decided to work on my upper body to pass the time.  What I'm wondering is how should I alter my diet to help this new routine?    I imagine I should cut down on carbs and up the protein a little (fat as well?).  I suppose I should also cut calories since I won't be burning as much.  Is this accurate?  I'm not looking to gain lots of mass, just build some long lean upper body muscle to help out when I get back to cycling and not gain fat. "
3185,Is cycling significantly better for knees compared to running?,I've been running 3+ times/week for cardiovascular fitness and other benefits but recently been feeling a bit of strain on my right knee. Its not painful but I guess it's prudent to hear the message that the body is trying to send and replace running with something more knee friendly.  It seems to me that the action of pushing the pedal does put stress on the knees so all that cycling really seem to do (compared to running) is to eliminate the sudden impacts of feet hitting the ground.  Given above -    How much more/less stressful on knees is cycling compared to running?  Is cycling really more knee-friendly compared to running or is it just a different type of equivalent stress?  Are there any scenarios where it could be worse on some joints/tendons/muscles than running?   PS: 1. I won't be getting a bicycle with gears etc. 2. The objective is to minimize joint damage while improving overall fitness. 3. Not planning to train for races etc. 
3186,Should I run with this ankle pain?,"I used to run regularly (15-18km on the long run day) and then had to take a 3 month break in between. This time, I started running in the minimalist shoes (since I suffer from over-pronation and wanted to correct my landing/form etc). I also wanted to explore this style of running.  Anyways, I got the vibrams bikila and started out with less distance/ slow speed / trying to absorb the change. I kept my distance to under 5 kms for about 3 weeks. However, after my last run of about 3kms, I noticed I have pain in the lower part of my (inner side) ankle on the right foot, below the bone. I gave it a day's rest and the next day when I went running again, I could barely complete 1 km. I have stopped running after that and giving it some rest now.  Here is the situation: - I have pain in my ankle only when I wake up in the morning ? Is that common - do any of you folks have also gone through this ? - During the day, the ankle doesn't hurt unless, sometimes when I am climbing up or down the stairs.  I am wary of injuries and hate it when I can't run for days due to injuries. I am trying to figure out if I should run or not ? If so, how much is ""ok"" ? Is there anything I can do to help my ankle (and in general, barefoot running). "
3187,100 push up challenge.,"I've recently started the 100 push ups a day challenge. Currently I am on day 5 and I started having difficulties completing one hundred push ups. In order to finish up my ""quota"" of push ups, I set my knees on the ground and do it like that.  I was wondering if this by any chance is ruining the idea of the whole challenge? I am not not a complete beginner tho, I'd say beginner to intermediate.   So far I haven't done nay rest days, should I take every 5th/7th or 10th day as a rest day?  "
3188,How to train for long walks (~100km)?,"How to train to be able to do really long walks (about 100km)?  Is the training for such walks similar to training for long runs? The distance is similar but when walk you can take pauses.  My goal is to be able to take part in orienteering competitions on 100km distance, where I have time limit of 24h. I'm also impressed by student mountain guide training, with include 100km long walk in mountains in winter condition with backpack.   My record as for yet is 50km walk in summer condition with light backpack, but I was sleeping very long next day, and as general, when I walk more that 20km I have often headache, so I think it can be lowered sugar level, which means for my body it's a 'calory shock'.  How to prepare my organism for such big effort and calory usages? Is it possible, that only some people are able to such effort and I will stop on this 50km border? "
3189,weightloss vs fatloss,"I am 24 years old, 62.35 kg in weight,and 5 feet 6 inch in height I have been working out daily at home, mainly cardiovascular workout from top rated app.   I want to grow a good fitness, a bit of abs, wide shoulder, good biceps and triceps. For this I am checking my calorie intake and keeping it within 2200 calories everyday for last few months.   As a result I am seeing few changes in my fitness but I lost weight from 65ks to 62.35 kg; but my goal was to lose fat not weight. I want to keep the weight but lose the fat.  Should not I be concerned with the weight loss? What should I do to keep this weight at around 62-65 but grow muscular? "
3190,Any fitness issues of child taking up jogging?,"My 6-year old daughter wants to accompany me on my ~3-times-per-week leisurely jog.  We're not talking Marathon training here &mdash; It's a social run-walk of a kilometer (0.6 miles) in about 15 minutes, but we've been talking about ramping it up towards 5K (leisurely) over time. She is active, no health problems, she'll get proper shoes and instruction, and we'll do the doctor visit yada-yada.  My question, specifically, is about the repetitive nature of cardiovascular, middle-distance road running; Is it developmentally stage-appropriate for a child: Muscular-skeletal, balance, repetitive stress, etc?   Is there a concern about someone of such a young age getting into running? "
3191,Should I try alternate which arm I carry weights / discs with at the gym?,"I do heavy weight lifting 5 times per week, and when I think back over all the times I have taken discs off the machines, carried them around to other machines, put them on the ground and so on, I have always used my right arm.  Should I be concerned about losing a balance between the strength in my right and left side if I continue to transport equipment using only one arm? Or will the actual workouts maintain that? I've been trying to make a habit of alternating my arms but it's surprisingly easy to forget about it once you've gotten into the workout.  I do feel as though my right side is slightly stronger than my left, but so far I have assumed this is natural because I am right handed. "
3192,Doing different aerobic exercises,"I'm swimming twice a week. My biggest issue is breathing and stamina, so I asked the teacher if running on the weekends would help. She told me that they are different kind of aerobic exercises, that a person may be able to swim one hour straight but not able to run a block, and vice-versa.  Maybe she exaggerated, but I found her answer interesting. Is that so? Let's say, if I were a runner, would doing 1 hour spinning (a different aerobic exercise) not help me as much? "
3193,Absolute Beginner in Weight Training,"History: I am an absolute beginner to the world of fitness and nutrition. I'm a classical geek that spends most of the time in front of the computer writing code, fixing stuff.    I've purchased a set of 15KG hand dumbbells and a Z bar 120 cm in size. This looked like the ideal beginner set to weight lifting.    I'm paying attention to what I eat, but in form of ""let's don't eat that much, eat only 3/4 of it"" so there is really no calorie or carb. measurement.    Goal: I want to improve my overall shape, build some muscles on my arms and my chest. They should definitely build up a little bit and I have to get rid of my belly fat.    Question:     Now for the very very beginner, which exact exercises should I do?   What practical technique for food can I apply?   Should I avoid some food in general, like mayonnaise and eggs?  "
3194,"Weight has gone down several pounds, but not trying to lose weight and feel fatter. Why?","I have been working out intensely as usual, but notice that my weight has begun to average around 3-5 lbs. lower than what it mostly would sit at. I feel like I've been getting fatter, but at the same time more muscular, but my weight has gone down.  From what I can tell, when you get more muscular your weight should go UP. I have seen more arm muscle size with measurements and have been cutting back on cardio due to losing focus and not sticking to my old routines, but I've still lost some weight while adding more muscle size -- and strangely I feel fatter. I have not made any dietary changes/energy expenditure changes/etc.  Why would I be gaining muscle size and feeling ""fuller"" and fatter, but be losing weight?  I can't be getting leaner because I wouldn't feel fatter -- and I can't be losing muscle because I'm seeing size improvements that are both visibly more noticeable and measurably larger too.  So why would I be losing weight slowly? I'm not losing fat nor muscle, so what else could it be?  It's not ""chronic"" changes -- more so it just seems that a couple of pounds have shed away from nowhere. I don't feel or look leaner, and I'm more muscular -- so why would I lose instead of gain?  Interestingly, I did more cardio before and ate less my weight always stayed steadily at 162 lbs. I do less cardio and eat the same, but now my weight is going down. Why? I'm not trying to force or change my weight -- I'm just noticing that it's going down and wondering why, if anything, it's not going up some due to more muscle. I'm male, 25, ~5'10"" and around 162 lbs. at 13% bodyfat. "
3195,Powerlifting vs Strongman,"For beginners, is there a much a difference in training and diet regimen whether one's ""end"" goal is strongman or powerlifting?  Does training/diet for the two diverge only at advanced levels, or even for beginners/newcomers as well? "
3196,Integrating Olympic lifting exercises into Strong Lifts,"I did Olympic weightlifting for 4 months with dream of becoming a competitive lifter but unfortunately had to move out of town and here I don't have access to any coach or even a proper gym for that matter. After 8 months of getting frustrated &amp; sitting idle, I started StrongLifts 5x5 and following standard program:     Workout A: Squat, Bench Press, Barbell Row   Workout B: Squat, Overhead Press, Deadlift,      Training 3 days a week with a linear progression of 2.5kg and switching between A/B/A and B/A/B workouts every week.   I'll get back to my town and thus to Olympic Lifting in an year or so. Currently I'm 1 month into StrongLifts 5x5 and squatting body-weight (60kgs).   In this program, Deadlift takes care of lifting weight off the ground to knee level. Over Head press takes care of lifting weight from shoulder to over-head. What I think lacks, and even miss, in this program is lifting weight from knee-level to chest level (or even over-head) which is key component of Olympic lifting. Power Clean or Snatch or Clean and Press integrates all 3 segments of lifting into one good compound exercise with long range of motion. How can I integrate any of such exercises into this program?  To be quite honest I am really missing the rigor of training I had under coach. We used to train everyday, both morning &amp; evening. Working just 3 days a week and that too 3 exercises per workout, seems quite lazy to me. Can I add any other exercises which will help me further in my Olympic lifting? "
3197,Does strength training cause an increase in sleep?,"My workout is divided as follows:  Chest/Biceps, Legs, Back/Triceps and Shoulders.   I workout 4-6 days a week, depending on my week's schedule. I have been off work lately for these past 15 days and working out with full swing. Although I have noticed that even when I get 8 hour sleep at night, I am very sleepy even after I wake up. What is causing this?  Muscle soreness occurs after a day of first 3 workouts, but its tolerable, only slightly more than before because of increased weights. I am getting the same nutrition, only a bit better than before. What should I do to avoid this sleepiness and feel energized once I am awake?  Thanks "
3198,Does this wear pattern on shoes indicate there is something wrong with gait?,Shoes have this wear pattern:     Is this a sign that something might be wrong with the gait? and if so what sort of symptoms might be expected or solutions might be worth trying? 
3199,Is having pure sugar during a workout a bad idea?,"On my gym days, I have developed a habit of mixing about 70 grams of this complex, slow releasing carbohydrate supplement with about 60 grams of literally pure sugar, and about 24 ounces of water.  I find that this mixture keeps me energized throughout the entire workout, and I assume it's because of the sugar's high glycemic index, but is this a bad idea for some reason I don't know about? Is it bad for my health to be taking this much sugar this way?  If it matters, I'm 25 years old, 5' 10"" tall, weight 140 Lbs, consume about 2,500 Calories a day, and just started the bulking phase after a long cutting phase. "
3200,What is a muscle knot?,"After starting lifting, or perhaps it was from bad posture at my desk job, I got what I think is a muscle knot and I'd like to know more about them.  What causes muscle knots? On both a higher level and a deeper scientific level.  Are there exercises or stretches or something that can be done to remedy muscle knots and why does it work?  Does stretching before/after exercising prevent muscle knots? Is there any other way to prevent muscle knots? "
3201,What is the simplest way to measure strength?,"Background  Last August, I started a project to get back into shape after a decade of inactivity. I chose to tackle endurance and cardiovascular fitness first, and to that end followed the Couch to 5k program. This worked well. In 6 months of training I've progressed from being able to jog for one minute to being able to run at 9km/hour for 90 minutes continuously.  One thing I liked about running is the ease with which you can record and measure your progress. I found it motivating to be able to easily and accurately compare my performance to my earlier performances. With running, this is easy: time and distance are both simple to measure.   What is the best way to measure strength?  Being satisfied with my endurance, it's now time for me to focus on improving my strength. (I'll keep running now and then, but only aim to maintain the current performance, not to improve it further.) So how do I measure my strength? Ideally, the measurement should have the following properties:   It shouldn't require special equipment. It should be doable anywhere. It shouldn't take more than 15 minutes.  The results should be one or more concrete numbers. The numbers should give a fair overview over most major muscle-groups.   Body-weight exercises seem to fit the bill nicely. Here's my current idea. I'm looking for critique and suggestions for improving this list:   Do push-ups for 3 minutes. Record the number. Do a plank for as long as possible. Record the seconds. Do pull-ups until muscle-failure. Record the number.   What is the best test of leg strength? What changes, if any, should I make to this list? "
3202,What is preferred: 300 non stop jogs or a brisk walk for 15 minutes?,"I am NOT fat. I have started exercising only for mental freshness and general fitness.  Actually I tried 300 jogs today and could complete them in mere 5-7 minutes, and was tired after that.  Is is preferred to do: 1. A brisk walk (which is less tiring, and more time consuming) for about 15 minutes? OR 2. Keep on jogging until you get tired (which results in less time consumption, but is more tiring)?  I think, a brisk walk for 15 minutes will be equally tiresome as 300-400 non stop jogs.  No, I am NOT short on time. I just wish to know the pros and cons of the above, and which one should be preferred and why? Does it make any difference? "
3203,Which calorie count for exercise should I trust?,"I've been working out by running around the neighborhood lately, and I've been tracking my runs on two running sites, as well as keeping track of the calories on MyFitnessPal.  However, I've been confuzzled lately about the calories that I should be tracking on my calorie tracking.  For example, for a recent 46-minute heavy interval run, I get:   881 calories burned from RunKeeper 1242 calories burned from Dailymile 765 calories burned from MyFitnessPal (entered as 46 minutes Jog @ 6mph)   These numbers are wildly different, and I don't want to over or under-eat calories based on my diet.  I would think that RunKeeper, which actually keeps track of my pace using the GPS and elevation would be better because of more data.  Lately I have been trying to under-estimate by using the lowest of the three that come up.  Which number should I be trusting?  Are any of these numbers worth anything? "
3204,How to get to 20 pull-ups while having also muscle growth?,"As a followup to this question, can I get to 20 pull-ups (instead of push-ups), doing the same routine as in the ascepted answer? i.e. going for failure, with moderate speed repetitions, and resting half a minute between each serie.  Also, is it possible to get some muscle growth while doing that routine? I'm asking because I don't know if one can train to have muscular endurance while having muscular growth at the same time. "
3205,Predicted 1RM accuracy,"In how far is a predicted one repetition maximum (1RM) accurate if there are several seconds between reps?   For example using this website.  Example: Let's say I do 10 x 150kg on the deadlift with average rep time of 9 sec (time from first rep to last pull divided by reps).   Is there a formula that takes rep time into account? If not, which rep time is acceptable between repetitions to call it a set / so the predicted 1RM works? "
3206,Eating pasta and developing a sixpack,"I know that it's very important to have a proper diet when you want to develop a sixpack. I often read that one should avoid pasta, rice, potatoes, bread and so on.   However, I like this stuff very much. Is there a way to incorporate pasta, rice, potatoes and bread into a diet which aims to develop a sixpack?  My idea is to do just more cardio, avoid sugar, alcohol completely and have enough proteins in my diet and eat much veggies and little fat.  Does this have a chance to work? Do you have any other suggestions? "
3207,Do energy Gels help in long Tennis matches,"I do a lot of long distance running and I normally take a gel if I am racing and it goes longer than 2 hours. (Like a Marathon) My question is for tennis would I get the same benefit? For example, a tennis match could last 2-3 hours. Would taking a gel every 40-50 minutes help mitigate cramping and give me some energy later in the match? "
3208,Maximum amount of time for anaerobic exercise,"I'm a 29 year old reasonably fit man. I used to run regularly but haven't ran much for the greater part of two years now. I do my 10 minute commute on a road bike daily, usually trying to go as fast as possible. I also practice the relatively niche sport of freediving where I train to hold my breath for a few minutes and swim to depths without air. My heart rate usually drops to 38 to 42 when I'm doing a breath hold (in the air, i.e. without the mammalian dive reflex).  I picked up running again just yesterday (for a race which is in ten days), and I was surprised to see that my HR monitor reports I'm doing most of my run in anaerobic, cf. the screenshot below.  Is there a maximum amount of time one should spend doing anaerobic exercise before it gets eventually dangerous? What should I watch out for if most of my running is in this HR range?   "
3209,fastest way to burn calories?,I am looking for the fastest way to burn calories. So far my research turned up that sprinting is the fastest way to burn calories. Is there anything more calorie consuming then sprinting? anything at all?  
3210,Relation between grip strength and power output,"I would say that I have a fairly strong grip. But when I pull 170 kg I feel the bar starting to slip (double overhand, no straps, no hook grip) right before lockout, so I missed the full lockout, because my strength gave in (the bar was not dropping, I was still able to set it down).  With mixed grip I pulled 3x165 kg the next day which is a greater achievement considering the predicted 1RM of 175kg.  The numbers don't matter here and are just a mere example. My question is: Can my body output more power/strength when my grip is stronger, let's say so strong that I don't even feel holding something?  Is there a study about that topic? "
3211,Why do nutritionists continue to advocate soy as a good source of protein? (especially for males),"In this post, Nutrition Diva's answer for question #10 ""Any good suggestions for getting enough protein as a vegetarian?"" includes soy. While the rest of her answers appear to be on track with the latest studies (vs. what a lot of doctors/""experts"" recommend), this one in particular worries me. (I blame @codinghorror for tweeting this post in the first place :))  From what I've read, phytoestrogens (which non-fermented soy is extremely high in) have been shown to contribute to many problems for males, specifically with cancer and fertility issues. I believe there are also cancer-related issues for females but haven't read as much on the subject. Unfortunately, neither books (e.g. Slow Death by Rubber Duck), nor video (e.g. The Disappearing Male) are easily linkable and I hesitate to take random sources procured from searches since they don't tend to be based on actual peer-reviewed, unbiased (i.e. non-sponsored) studies.  Is there a (linkable) affirmative source that has the same information? "
3212,What are the Single or Two ply powerlifting suit benefits?,"Are there any long term benefits to using single/two ply powerlifting suits? Or are they just used to allow more weight to be lifted during competitions?  For belts, I've noticed better form and stronger core after wearing them - is there any similar benefit to wearing the suits? "
3213,How much carrot juice should I drink to get orange?,I want to be orange. Have an orange skin to look tanned without exposing myself to the sun. I read that it is possible to get orange color of skin by drinking lots of carrot juice.  How much carrot juice should I drink to be orange? And how often? 
3214,How to prepare for a physical fitness test in a couple of weeks?,"I'm a 23 years old male (75 KG) never exercised before, I only walk from time to time and I have a physical fitness test in a couple of weeks (2 to 4) and I'm looking for a training program that will help me improve fast without injuring myself.  What the test includes:   Running 2 KM 80 Push ups (40 to pass) 90 Sit ups (45 to pass)   What I'm already doing:   Walking in the morning for longer distances, to prepare for running (today walked about 1.7 KM) Doing knee push ups (about 20 each set) Doing 20 sit ups each set   So how can I improve faster ? and what program should I follow for a total beginner like me ? "
3215,Bench press - shoulders down and back,"I'm unclear on exactly what keeping ""shoulders down and back means"". Does ""down"" mean extending your chest such that the shoulders stay back in position? And back meaning simply don't shrug them up but keep them down? "
3216,What are the top intensive bodyweight exercises?,"I am 22 and have tried two gyms, but I always fall back to burpees.  I am looking for more exercises that   are fun to do. require only bodyweight (and minimal equipment). are intensive and have even more intensive variants. target a wide variety of muscles (including the core muscles). can be done indoors.     What other exercises exist that have similar advantages?    I can only recall these from my monotonous workout:   Burpees Russian Twists  "
3217,How to run faster every time without injuries ?,How to run faster ?   I am trying to improve my running speed... my fastest time for 400 m is 1 minute 30 seconds...  I am trying to break this time since 1 month but I cant...   What technique I should use to run and what diet should I take to increase the energy ?  what is the most scientific way to run ?  
3218,What is the correct physical fitness path here?,"When a person feels that s/he is ""out of shape"".  Should the goal be to lose weight, or to improve health regardless of what that does to the number on the scale?  Why? "
3219,Why do compound exercises build more mass than isolation exercises?,"I've heard this a million times:      If you want to get massive, you have to do compound exercises, not   isolation exercises.   A specific example is the Hodge twins suggesting to do chin-ups rather than barbell curls to get bigger arms. What's the scientific explanation for this? In a chin-up, the weight is distributed across your biceps, latissimus dorsi, and some other back muscles. On a barbell curl, the weight is mostly concentrated on the bicep. It appears to me that the bicep is doing more work in the barbell curl than the chin-up (if you adjust the weight properly for a fair comparison). So how is it possible that the compound exercise is going to get you bigger arms than the isolation exercise? "
3220,Are pull ups and shrugs opposing exercises?,"For the pull ups I use slightly wider than shoulder and reverse/pronated (palms facing away) grip, I weigh 135 lbs. For shrugs I am standing holding dumbbells - 15 or 20 lbs. - at my side.  Are these opposing exercises? I mean, do they exercise opposing muscle groups?   My understanding is shrugs lift the should blades, while pull ups pull the arm down. So, not really opposite movements. However, I do pull my shoulder blades down and together as I perform the pull ups.  Maybe another way to state my question is what the ideal opposing exercises for pull ups and push ups? I do both of those, but they don't seem to have a perfectly match opposite like bicep/tricep. I have been doing push ups paired with reverse dumbbell flies and pull ups paired with shrugs. "
3221,What are your views on weight training while injured?,"If I have any sort of injury I immediately stop training until it has recovered to a certain point. However, once I start training again, the injury often feels better after a session than it had done before.   Clearly if you're in pain when you train with an injury, this is bad but there seems to be some middle ground where training can actually aid recovery. I'm guessing it must be increased blood flow or something, I don't know.  So what do you guys do? Train what isn't injured, train thru the pain, rest or something else? "
3222,How do I do a proper situp?,What should I be focusing on when doing a situp? Are there ways to reduce strain on muscle groups that should not be getting strained? 
3223,What can I do if weight decreasing stopped after I reached half of my goal?,"When I started my diet I was at 82kg now my weight oscillates between 74 and 75kg. I've read that I should target 0.5-1kg weekly weight loss. I tried out a diet with 0.75. I've calculated that my BMR is 1,659 Calories/day and my diet contains food equals to 1600 Calories/day.  A friend of mine who is a dietitian said that I should not decrease my daily calorie intake below my BMR since it can result in an unfavorable response from my body: it can adapt to prolonged decrease in calorie intake and lower its energy needs. I am not a dietitian but I'm stuck with 75kg while my diet in theory should result in a 0.75kg weight loss per week. What could be the problem? Can it be the case described above? If yes what can I do?  Note that I always calculate the weight loss into my daily calorie needs so for example when I was 82kg I was eating something around 1700 calories and now it is around 1600.  I am doing resistance training (2 times per week) and HIIT (2-3 times a week) on different days of each week.  Edit: My height is 168cm and my parameters did not change significantly in the past several weeks (waist/shoulder/etc size) "
3224,Can Starting Strength be made faster?,"At my work weight it takes me between 60 and 75 minutes to finish the novice Starting Strength program.  I would like to be in and out of the gym in about 40 min.   When I diminish my work weights I'm able to do the exercises faster, but when I try to push my current max I fail the sets if I cut the rest time shorter.  I have been following a strength training program for about 14 months (Stronglifts 2.5 months, Starting Strength the remaining time).  My current program and max work weights are:  Day 1 Squat 3x5  115kg Bench 3x5   65kg  Snatch 5x3  37.5kg  Day 2 Squat 3x5  Press 3x5 42.5kg Dead  1x5 100kg Chins 9x6x5 (target is 3x15)   I follow this warmup schedule and rest 5 min between sets.  Can I optimize Starting Strength for workout duration while still doing progress, even if moderate? "
3225,How to find what muscle groups to strengthen?,"Without a specific sport in mind, are there good general-purpose exercises or movements that can show me what muscle groups or areas need more work?  I'm trying to make sure that my overall strength is in balance, to maximize it's practical usefulness in solving everyday problems.   Whats the basic procedure for testing things like this? Are there tests-to-failure that can expose these (e.g. lifts or movements)?  "
3226,How to keep energy up while on diet,"I have started to change my diet and attempt to become more healthy with the goals of being in much better shape, becoming healthier, and feeling better overall.  With this in mind, I have done my best to either eliminate all together or massively minimize my soda consumption, drink large amounts of water, restrict carbs, lower significantly the amount of calories in my meals, etc.  My typical meal plan now looks like the following:   High protein shake for breakfast - mixed with water Handful of peanuts mid-morning for snack Lunch is usually a flax and low card tortilla with fresh spinach and sliced deli meat Handful of peanuts mid-afternoon for snack Supper is either another wrap like lunch or something with high protein content, sometimes it is just another shake like for breakfast Try to drink nothing but water or tea during the day but usually water   The trouble that I have started having is a reduce amount of energy or feeling of fatigue.  I am wanting to start something like P90/P90X but do not think that I could complete it right now due to sluggishness and general malaise.  Is there something that I should be doing differently to help with this?  How can I continue to be healthy and increase my energy levels? Note that I would still like to keep carbs and/or calories low to help loose weight. "
3227,How quickly can a runner drain lactic acid out of his quads?,"For years, I've always played around doing fartlek training and never pushed myself to run fast (7-min/miles is fast for me) for more than one mile.  Today, I decided to run 7-min/miles for as long as possible. At mile 1.8, I felt good but my quads completely shut down. I had to start walking. To my absolute shock, after about 1-minute I was able start running again (but a much slower 10-min/mile pace which I can run at for several miles with no problems).  Can you really clear enough lactic acid in just 1-minutes out of quadriceps to go from just being able to walk to being able to run again? That does surprise me. Or, maybe something else is happening to make my quads tap-out. The issue is simply my quads are not strong enough to support my body weight which builds up the lactic acid, right? My quads don't ""hurt"", somehow I just know/sense they cannot absorb any more impact. "
3228,Can I cycle or run with shoulder niggles?,"I have developed a slight niggle in my right shoulder. Reason could be because of over workout in swimming. The niggle is light pain when I move my shoulders a bit fast with some weight on it. For example pulling the water while swimming. It is not severe and all. That is why mentioned it as niggles.  Now my question is, can I cycle or run? I have planned for a slow jogging or very slow cycling(both being a bit long) for coming three days followed with one day's rest and then start swimming.  Is it okay? Any suggestions?  The answer I am expecting is similar to this: For different extent of shoulder injury, different allowance of running or cycling can be done or may be that there is no such thing (can do running or cycling, it doesn't matter to the shoulder at all) or may be that I shouldn't do both.  "
3229,How to keep the legs healthy when climbing stairs,"My favorite sport is climbing staircases by foot, then going down by elevator and going up again by feet, etc. I feel it hurts the legs much less than jogging, since I don't 'fall' on my legs while climbing.  Still, I would like to do if there are any risks of leg injuries when climbing stairs?  In particular, what kind of shoes are best suited for this kind of sport? Currently I use simple walking shoes (not running shoes), is this good enough? "
3230,"On a 3x5 program, can I do 4x5 or 5x5 if I'm able to?","If I'm many months in to Starting Strength (which prescribes 3 sets of 5 at the work weight), but I can do 4 or 5 sets, would this be advisable?  I know I could just try it, and if I start stalling, it would mean I'm not getting enough recovery from the extra load, but if I don't stall, are there any downsides?  (I'm guessing this may be a more useful change to the program for an absolute beginner, who doesn't have to worry about too much volume at the low weights.) "
3231,Bilateral vs single leg squats,"When training for a sport that includes a lot of single leg jumps (basketball, for example), how specific should the strength training be? Does strength training need to be single leg?  I see two ways of approaching this, and I'm not sure which is correct, or if I'm missing a third altogether:   Just get your basic two-leg barbell squat, deadlifts, power cleans as strong as possible. If your two-leg squat gets stronger, your one-leg squat gets stronger. No need for single-leg strength training. Single leg strength work is important. Two-leg squats don't train the movement that's displayed in single-leg jumps.   I'm asking how specific the strength training needs to be. Of course, we practice single-leg jumps very often in plyometric routines, games, drills, etc. "
3232,Coffee with sugar after cycling (or any cardio)?,"There is ample discussion on the internet suggesting that we need carbs after exercise (for example here and here). The second link also shows contradicting answers: complex carbs vs simple sugars.  Also, there are suggestions to drink milk chocolate or home-made recovery drink (water, sugar, salt and lime). Both of these drinks contain sugar.  I am cycling daily to my work (about 10km each way) and I am starting weight-lifting next week. I also have healthy and big breakfasts.  Question  Provided my goal is to burn fat and recover my muscles after cycling, can I drink coffee with sugar as a post cycling drink? Or as a post jogging drink on the weekends? I am more concerned about the white sugar aspect, rather than caffeine.  I won't give up on coffee, but I can easily give up on sugar.  "
3233,"Dynamic or static version of exercise, like the side plank","How does the dynamic version of an exercise compare with the static version? For example, in the case of the side plank, how results would differ between the two? Is this just a question of personal preference? "
3234,Push ups and (blood?) pressure?,"When I do push-ups, I notice pronounced pressure increases in my head, eyes, ears.  I do 20, with what I hope is top form:  slow (about up and down in 2 sec), chest and forehead touch floor each time, raised all the way up.  I just did 20 and my ears feel sort of ringing.  Note that I don't find doing 20 terribly hard--I feel I could push myself to do perhaps 25 or maybe 30 if I really strained.  But even after about 15, I begin to feel that pressure.  I do breathe in and out throughout the movements, though not in any particularly careful way.  I do not get this when I do bench press or any other weight lifting (preacher bench curls, pull ups, tricep press downs), even to near failure with high reps (15, 12, 10, 8), nor with jogging/running.  Just push-ups.  Considering that at least one person has had eye capillaries rupture due to push ups, and 2 people have had aortic aneurysm dissections following push ups (or, of course, other intense weight lifts), this has me concerned.  (Sure, of course, millions haven't had such things happen, too...just erring on the side of caution).  Push ups strike me as a simple and good exercise I can do at home easily, and a good measure of muscular endurance, but I am rather put off them every time I feel this unpleasant pressure.    How common is this?  Is there a way to avoid it and do the push ups more safely?  Or perhaps are push ups just not for all people (as if there are some systemic differences that happen during push ups in only some people)?  I am willing to try altering my approach, but if I can't get around the ""pressure problem"", push ups are out of my repertoire. "
3235,Will a full-body routine like this be effective for muscle mass gain?,"Routine:   Dead-lifts (Traditional) 1x12 Barbell Squats 1x12 Lunges 1x12 Military Press 1x12 Upright Rows 1x12 Barbell Bench Press 1x12 Pull-ups 1x8 Barbell Curls 1x10 Dumbell French Press 1x10 Dips 1x8 Seated Calf Extensions 1x12 Crunches 1x12   I've always trained using split routines that work two or three muscles each day, I've had progress but not much on the side of muscle mass gain. I find this routine to be quite peculiar because it works the whole body 3 days a week (every other day), however I find it suspicious that only one set of each exercise is performed, my worry is that the muscle won't be stimulated enough to grow (assuming a proper nutrition of course).  Has anyone used a routine similar to this one and observed progress?,   or that has tried and had success with a routine with more basic exercises with more sets in each one? (similar to StrongLifts 5x5) "
3236,How to find the right fitness class?,There are many fitness clubs and centers in my city area.  How to choose the most appropriate option for me ?   At this point I don't really know what is the most important to ask for regarding fitness clubs.   Edit:  Thank you for all your comments. Let me reformulate my question then:  What questions should I ask myself before I can decide on the right fitness class  ? 
3237,Is it physically possible to have a calorie deficit for a month and gain 5 kilos of weight while being on diet and training?,Is it physically possible to have a calorie deficit for a month and gain 5 kilos of weight while being on diet?   I am eating around 1500-2000 calories a day and I should be taking around 3500 minimum given the fact that I swim vigorously for an hour a day or more.   So I should have roughly lost around 5 6 kilos realistically this month but instead I have gained five kilos! What exactly does this mean? I have gained 5 kilos of muscle? Yes I used to do serious training before and well I think my waist-size has not increased in this period and it might have got reduced slightly. I am 6 2 and was 100 kilos when i started and now i am 105.   I am a bit confused because this is rather extreme!  
3238,How does riding a unicycle compare to riding a bicycle for weight loss?,"I see many on-line calculators for calculating calories burned while riding a bicycle. Would riding a unicycle be similarly useful for losing weight?  I notice there are several differences between riding a bicycle and riding a unicycle:   Bicycles have larger wheels and a chain, which changes how fast the bike moves relative to how fast one is pedaling, but unicycles have a smaller wheel and the wheel only turns as fast as one pedals. Bicycles can easily reach more than 20 mph, but a unicycle rider will have difficulty reaching more than 7 mph. Bicycle riders can shift gears when encountering a hill. Unicyclists cannot shift gears.   Will riding a unicycle still be of benefit for weight loss? Will it be considerably less useful than riding a bicycle? "
3239,Abdomen training window,Why most trainers recommend you to train your abs every day? Why are they not respecting the 24-48 hour training window? 
3240,Speed of abdomen exercises,"I have an abdomen plan for a month with steadily increasing amount of   situps crunches planks   I like to replace slow situps by fast ones by doing half indians (both hands and legs fast moving up; trying to do full indians). I have to do normal situps very slowly without losing balance, which is irritating.  Then, I like to replace also crunches with fast crunches.  However, I am not sure if these are good changes.  What is the significance of speed doing abdomen exercises? "
3241,"Am I in a so-called ""good running form""?","I ran a 5000 m on the track on Saturday, and two days later, on Monday, I ran a 5 km road race. The results are almost the same (21:44 and 21:48), and I could push my body really hard in both cases, in warm weather no less. Doing races feels easy to me right now. I train every day, race at least once a week. It's all easy peasy.  Aside from my weight (75 kg, 1.74 m, BMI 24,8), which has to drop even further, does this mean I am currently in what one would call a ""good running form""?  If not, how would I know when my performance is peaking and I should start thinking about taking it easier in a few weeks time to let my body recover from the hardships of training and racing?  Additional information: I've been actively training for more than 16 years, mostly to support my running habit. Since April 1st, except for weekly race days, I've been training daily, and racing between 5 and 15 km. Aside from the races (6 - 19 % of weekly distance), my training consists mainly of endurance runs (70 - 80%), with some interval training (10 - 15 %). My current weekly distance is around 80 km (50 mi). "
3242,Body Building for 40+,"I am 42 and would like to start doing some body building exercises (especially my chest and arms).  Is this something achievable or the age factor will be an obstacle? if so, can I use same routines as other younger people or I need something special for my age?   "
3243,"Is it necessary to do flat, incline and decline flys?","On Thursdays I work on my chest and triceps. This is probably my favourite workout day, except for the final component which is flat, incline and then decline flys.  My current Thursday looks like this:     3x8 Flat Bench dumbbell press.   3x8 Incline Bench dumbbell press.   3x8 Decline Bench dumbbell press.      3x10 Tricep pulldowns.   3x10 Skull crushers.   4x8 Close grip bench.      3x10 Flat Bench flys.   3x10 Incline Bench flys.   3x10 Decline Bench flys.   As you can see, there's a lot going on. And to top it off, I train with a friend which makes this workout my longest one averaging at just over 2 hours. Another thing is that flys just aren't that enjoyable compared to the rest of the workout.  Is it necessary to do this many variations of flys each chest day? I am seeing good shaping + size but I feel like that's coming naturally from press rather than all the flys I am doing. Would I see little to no difference if I rotated between flat, incline and decline flys each chest day and only did 1 perhaps? "
3244,"No visible results, can anyone help?",I’m 16 years old. I’ve been using gold whey protein for quite some time now n frankly I'm seeing no results so I was thinking of switching to inner armor hard mass gainer..think it's a good idea? And also I think whey irritates my acne too so does hard mass container whey too? Thanks in advance. 
3245,Chalice Squat Variation - Safe and Effective?,"To replace the barbell back or front squat, I stand a heavy (80lb+) dumbell end-on on the floor, grasp the upper weights, and stand up. Is this a good alternative to the chalice squat? (Much more below!)  I am doing my best to follow a Starting Strength regimen - but the barbell exercises (except, oddly enough, the deadlift) have all caused injury.   I've switched to dumbbells for the overhead and bench press, and assisted dips/chins/pulls in place of the clean-and-jerk.   My concern is now with an adequate squat replacement. Back squats gave me no-kidding nerve damage that's only now healed after four months. (I couldn't feel my left arm for a while... I apparently have vertebrae that are incompatible with a heavy steel bar across even the meatiest part of my back.)  The injury from the bench-press means front squats are out - I don't have the shoulder mobility to heave that much weight up front with my arms like that.   The chalice squat is difficult but do-able, but I'm worried it taxes my lower back too much to raise a heavy dumbbell (80lbs) chest-high, and that holding the dumbbell like that means I can't squat as deeply as I like as my elbows and the dumbbell itself interferes.  Yesterday, I tried a variation on it, where I stand the dumb-bell on-end on the floor, squat down to grasp the upper weights, and do the squat exercise beginning with up rather than down. It feels natural, I can manage heavier weights, squat deep, and my thighs are still on fire a day later (a good thing, I couldn't get DOMS going with the traditional chalice squat).  Is this exercise a good replacement for a barbell squat? Am I risking another injury doing it this way rather than lifting the weight up to my chest? "
3246,Exhuastion before and after workout,"I have been working out for 2 weeks and I have noticed that I am very lazy. Even though I take supplements I tend to stay so lazy that except for gym time, I don't get off the couch. Except the gym, I have no physical activity. The reason is I feel too lazy and down.  I had my test and I am fine. Sometimes I feel so tired that workout too feels like a burden. It's like i am wasting or wasted. I am 29 and i am 78.5 kg. What can the problem be? Can it be genetic? As my mother sleeps too much or where I was bought up? What should i do to make myself feel energetic and powerful?  Even when I wake up, I feel too down or wasted energy. Any test or routine changes I can make? "
3247,Enough Air Input for Free style,"Although I took swimming lessons while I was a kid, I was never super strong and never mastered good free style form.  Now 50, and attempting to complete in a triathlon (sprint).  As a person with a partial disability, this is a really big deal for me.    One thing I notice, is that I do not seem to get enough air on the input breath during proper free style form.  My body seems to want to use far more air then what I am able to bring in.  Additionally if I stick my head out of the water to breathe, I can only go a short distance while reverting to my favorite energy conserving stroke:  the side stroke.  The sensation is that of a slow suffocation as I do not seem to have the ability to take a really good breath.    Any advice on overcoming that sensation?  Any advice on how to become comfortable for the amount of air received?   "
3248,Why is my swimming fitness so much worse than my cycling and running fitness?,"I cycle a lot, I run a bit, and I swim once per week. I have been training once per week for 5 months now. When I started, I could barely swim a length of freestyle. Now I can swim a lap with ease.  However, I am struggling to swim more than a single lap without stopping at one end. Now I know what you're all thinking: form and efficiency. I don't think this is the primary reason for my poor swimming performance, as I have focused on efficient form from day 1, and have had others verify that my freestyle technique is smooth.  My question is, is swimming fitness that much different to cycling and running fitness? Is this normal, and why is this the case? "
3249,How can I get a feminine body?,"I'm a newbie here, so please forgive me if such kind of a question has already been answered. So, I'm a male. Yeah, I might get a lot of backlash for this one, but I'll cut to the chase. I want a feminine body, meaning, I want bigger hips and slimmer upper body. I really don't know if I can achieve something like that without any deviations from my original plan, but asking is not penalized, is it. What kind of exercises should I take on? Do I need a specific diet? If any additional information is necessary, I might share it with you. "
3250,Does slowly increasing calories mean lean gains?,"Have there ever been any academic studies on how slowly increasing calories vs quickly increasing calories effects muscle gain and body fat for people who weight train / body build? By slowly increasing calories, I mean around 25 to 50 calories every 2 weeks.  Assuming that slowly increasing calories is an effective method of putting on lean mass, where should the extra calories be coming from (protein, or fats, or carbs) and how long will it take to put on 1 lbs of weight? Should cardio be limited if you're increasing calories this slowly? "
3251,Biceps brachialis sorness but not brachii,"I do push/pull days MWF, my pull days consisting of 9 sets of 4-8 reps compound back movements, and then 6-9 sets of 4-8 reps on bicep isolation. I do different arm positions for biceps (incline dumbbell curls, preacher curls, etc.). I focus a lot of the negative portion and generally go slow with around 30 seconds between sets and exercises.  I've noticed that whenever I do pull days, if my biceps get sore afterwards, it seems to always be the brachialis (sore near the joint and ""outer"" bicep area, not the much larger ""two-headed"" bicep ball), but not the long or short head of the brachii. My palms are always facing away from me for the entire movement on all biceps exercises.  I have no issue working different parts of my triceps, but for some reason, it seems as though my brachialis are always the part that gets hit and nothing else when doing biceps.  Maybe my brachialis is comparatively weak and therefore is the limiting factor? Maybe the brachialis must first be flexed before the brachii, and I'm unknowingly doing too limited of a range of motion to hit the brachii? Any other ideas? "
3252,Resistance bands,"I need some advice regaurding resistance bands. I am thinking of buying one of them (and only one probably). I want it to develop muscles. I am not able to perform bodyweight exercises properly as my muscles are weak (which is why I am thinking  of buying a resistance band to develop them). I need advice regaurding what type (light ,medium or heavy) band I should buy. I dont want it to be too easy. I dont have access to free weights nor to gyms. I have seen some videos on resistance band exercises and it seems to be effective. Does anybody have any opinion/experience otherwise? Please help. Also which lenght resistance band will be ideal for me? I am 5 feet 5 inches and weight is about 60 kg.  "
3253,Does pushing yourself harder have any benefit to your results?,"I am wondering i there're any specific benefits to pushing yourself extremely hard vs. just pushing yourself a little hard. Does pushing harder create more muscle? Make you stronger?  To simplify, imagine someone works out hard, and doesn't get injured; and now imagine someone pushes themselves EVEN harder and still doesn't get injured.  Disregarding any potential injuries or halting in the process (let's assume pushing yourself EXTREMELY HARD will still not be considered ""overworking"" yet).  Does pushing harder have any extra benefits vs. just pushing a little hard?  Like fighting for every next rep vs. just stopping altogether when feeling a bit tired. Is that extra push and ""drive"" beneficial vs. someone who may not otherwise fight or go as hard/long?  Again, assuming NEITHER one sustains injury nor impedes progress, would pushing yourself to your hardest be anymore beneficial than just going at it until feeling a little tired and then stopping?  Does pushing harder make it more likely that you'll break past plateaus? Stimulate nuclei better? Work the muscle better? Expect results sooner/later? Stimulate the nervous system in a different way?  Imagine someone on a rep curling and they have it half way up, but the force is tough and they're tired and just let it go down without exerting the force -- but another person stays halfway for 20 extra seconds, giving every bit of might and mental power they have to get it up one last time.  Would that person who killed themselves trying to fight and exert every bit of mental fortitude they have benefit from anything vs. the guy who works hard, but doesn't kill himself to get that one last rep after 10-20 tough sets of arms? Basically, does pushing yourself very hard have any upsides, assuming it's not hard enough to impede progress, but hard enough to take a mental/physical toll?  Just picture the guy that worked hard, but sweat a little -- and that other guy that worked harder, and is trembling for hours due to pushing his nervous system beyond his ""comfort zone,"" but still doesn't impede or ""overwork."" I put quotes around ""overwork"" because people think doing extra 5 sets is overworking, when overworking means excessively exercising for prolonged periods of time and lacking in diet, sleep, or adequate ""downtime."" Most people never reach ""overworking"" because most people do not work hard enough to have a chance at getting there anyways. ""Overworking"" is not just pushing yourself extremely -- it's a constant, ongoing fatigue and lack of attention to your health. "
3254,How much competition weight loss can be considered safe?,"When I watch professional martial arts fights, I often find myself baffled how fighters that - judging by the looks - share my body composition compete in weight classes that are more than 10 kg below my own weight. I found out that most of this is due to manipulating the amount of water in your body and read about professional middleweight boxers whose difference in weight between weight-in day and the fight the day after could go up as high as 25 pounds.  The downside of this practise is that you take a huge risk: There's of course the acute danger to die of rehydration if you go too far, but even if you survive this process, you could impede your fighting potential because of malnourishment - or because you gorged yourself too hard after making weight.  So, my question is: Assume you are at the exact body composition level (lean body mass and %body fat) you also expect to have at the day of the competition. How much additional weight can you expect to lose by means of fasting, emptying out intestines, losing water, spitting,... safely (*) when   a) the weight-in is 24 hours before the competition? b) the weight-in is 3 hours before the competition?   Do martial arts competitions and weightlifting competitions require different considerations?    (*) by 'safely' I mean 'not significantly impeding your competition capabilities' and with 'not significantly' I mean that the benefits of competing in a lower weight division still outshine the negative effects of the weight cutting process.

3255,Atlas stone experience?,"My current strength routine consists of olympic-style squats, clean &amp; jerks, snatches, clean pulls, that sort of thing.  I'm making steady progress, but considering adding some variation.  Does anybody have any experience with atlas stones?  The explosive hip extension and massive core involvement in movements such as the stone to shoulder seem like they would have a great carryover to oly movements.    Has anybody found success with this strongman tool, specifically in relation to olympic lifts?  Are they a good supplemental exercise for olympic lifts?  What were your experiences? "
3256,Locking of the jaw during workout related stress,"The sympathetic nervous system (SNS) is involved in energy expenditure as it drives the body to respond to stress. So when one is lifting weight or doing a pullup or pushup and is about to finish the repetition specially during last two the jaw bone locks,  the parasympathetic nervous system (PSNS), acts as the calming, energy-conserving and healing branch of the ANS. Balancing out this locking of the jaw after the session is over. However when the balance between the two is lost, the jaw stays locks up for more then 30 secs after the stress is released. Does anybody have idea of the direct this response to other area so the jaw is released after at the end of the repetition. ? Or how to restore the balance ? "
3257,Wendler 5/3/1: cut or not to cut?,"I have been doing Wendler's 5/3/1 for about 6 weeks now (2 cycles) and am really enjoying it. I am lifting 4 days a week. For assistance, I've been following the boring but big template.  Foodwise, I've been taking my own homemade mass gainer (on lifting days) which consists of the following ingredients:   2 scoops protein powder (240kcals) 2 cups milk (300 kcals) 1 cup oats (300 kcals) 2 scoops almond butter (200 cals)   Everyday, I am consuming approximately 2500-3000kcals.           My question is: My weight has shot up by about 4 pounds since the start of 5/3/1, and I've noticed that I've gained a bit of fat. Should I decrease my calorie intake? I ask this because I am worried that my decreasing my calorie intake, I might lose strength gains.  Anyone been on 5/3/1 with a similar dilemma?     "
3258,Bench press - unracking bar bell,What is the correct way to unrack the barbell when bench pressing?   Should you attempt to almost slide it as opposed to simply lifting it up?  I know sliding is a lot easier if the hooks are flat but on some benches the hooks are quite deep so what does one do in this instance? 
3259,Are crunches an effective exercise for building the abs?,"Vince Gironda was famous for training people like Arnold and Lou Ferrigno and operating Vince's Gym.  He was one of the OGs of professional bodybuilding.    There's a story I've heard more than once about a man doing crunches at Vince's gym.  Apparently, Vince refunded his money, told him to get his stuff, and kicked him out of his gym, saying something like, ""nobody does crunches in my gym!""  Why would Vince be so anti-crunch?  Is there any merit to this belief? Are crunches an effective ab exercise for bodybuilding? "
3260,Can you build size and strength at the same time/together efficiently?,"Most people seem to focus solely on one vs. the other, but I'd imagine many people want both. Can you train for both of them adequately? For example, train to get bigger and maximize muscle size; but also train to get stronger and be able to lift more weight and have more overall power too.  I follow my own routines which work for me, but I can't comment on how ""efficient"" they are for anyone else -- and I can't say they're positively the best method for me either. Basically, here's what I do:  I set aside one ""brutal"" day -- that is, a day where the muscles are worked very, VERY hard. I combine higher reps with lower weights, and higher weight with lower reps -- and often go to failure or beyond. I do not limit reps and go anywhere from 1 to sometimes 50+. I basically combine elements of power, strength, endurance, and hypertrophy in to one workout as feasibly as I possibly can.  I notice results, but they're not very fast -- but that could be just the way my body is. No workout is ""perfect"" -- people often have to find what's the best their body can do. I believe my body can't do much better, so I generally stick to what years of experience and reasonably acceptable results gets me. So, back to the point, can you have the best of both or ""all"" worlds, or am I going at it the tougher way? I don't care personally -- I just want to know if doing both is more efficient or not. I know I can make heads or tails either way since I'm dedicated and motivated enough to accomplish anything. "
3261,How to avoid blisters while running barefoot?,"I have started to run barefoot because no shoe suits my feet perfectly. I ran a half marathon yesterday and made my PB too, I am happy. But during the course of running I developed blisters. I enjoy the pain but I am scared that it may lead me to a bad injury, if I continue this.   So my question is, is there any tape for barefoot running? I have heard of some tape but I don't know how they refer to it. How do they refer to it?  Or is there any better ways to avoid blisters? I can't afford the five fingers shoe.  Please help "
3262,"Can you be a professional athlete without the use of steroids/AAS, SARMs, peptides/GH, etc.?","Just as the title states. Is it possible for anyone to have the physical capacity to be a professional-level athlete without ever taking any steroids/AAS/testosterone, growth hormones/peptides, SARMs, or any other enhancement drugs like such? Or in other words, can one be 100% natural and be capable of performing well enough to play in professional sports teams, whether high or low level?  I ask because people point fingers and make blanket statements like, ""99% of pro athletes are on drugs"" and etc. If that's true, is it because it's impossible to be a pro athlete without them, or it's just easier to be a pro athlete with them? I'd like the reality here. I know it's a broad question, but still.....  I really ask because I have a smaller brother who wants to be an NHL player. People have told him that all of those guys use drugs, so he'll have to if he wants any chance at succeeding. "
3263,Does slowing negative and positive movements of exercises build muscle,"I've heard that the perfect form of bodyweight exercises need to be slow. For instance, in pull ups, I have to go up in 2 seconds, pause a second at the top position and then go down in 2 seconds. Which goal does that technique help, muscle gain or endurance ?    In another words, If I can do 20 fast movement push ups and I want to build more muscle using push ups. Will I gain muscle if I used the technique mentioned above ?  "
3264,"Starting Strength, time to move on?","I'm 41 years old, 1.82m tall and weigh 82kg.  I have been on strength training for 14 months (2.5 stronglifts, 11.5 starting strength).  I didn't do the program, as Riptoe would put it. I never got used to drinking the whole lot of milk it requires.  At the end of the first 2.5 months, my lifts were at this:  Squat 5x5  90kg Bench 5x5  60kg Press 5x5  40kg Row   5x5  52kg Dead  1x5  90kg   After that I moved to starting strength, got sick, had persistent injuries, vacation, etc. Progress has been erratic.

However I don't feel I progressed as much as I should in most lifts, have been plagued by injuries on my shoulders (probably caused by a fall I had while running years ago which spread to both shoulders when I started sleeping on only the uninjured side) and overall feel like going to the gym is a chore.   Is it time to move on to a different program or a variation on the starting strength theme that would allow me to progress?  Suggestions?  The program I'm following is the described on this question.

3266,Starting running,"I've done plenty of high intensity sports training (kickboxing, circuit trainings etc) but never running. This fall I was bitten by the running bug. I started doing around 10km runs once or twice a week. Then I got my Icebugs and did few 14km runs on snow.  Now both ankles are inflammed. My ortopedic put me on pain meds and no running for two weeks and then to start easier. Here's the problem. What's easier? As I said I'm pretty fit so my ankles apparently break a lot before my fitness gives in. So how should I progress my runs now when I return to running?  Edit:  I run with short steps and mainly forefoot landing as I think this should be best for my ankles/knees? I don't pronate/supinate. According to ankle x-rays there's nothing wrong with my ankle structurally. "
3267,Does running twice a day regularly increase my risk of injuries?,"I live about 3.2 miles from where I work, and the most efficient way to commute is running there in the morning and back in the evening.   Is 2 runs a day 3-5 days a week healthy? Does it increase my risk of injury?  Especially repetitive stress injury? I've had problems with this before from long-distance running in my ankles and knees  Would it be better to alternate between running and biking?  "
3268,What is core training and who should be doing it?,I am looking into a wide variety of workouts to keep  from getting boredom. There is a term that seems to be thrown around here: core training. My question is what is it and who should be doing it? Is it advanced and hence only for the very athletic? 
3269,Do programs from books like You Are Your Own Gym and Your Body Is Your Barbell work?,"I've been lifting for the past 6 months but my nutrition side has been mediocre. Mostly due to lack of time as a student and dangling from home to gym to school. Recently, I came across books on bodyweight exercises and they have been really impressive.  I respect calisthenics and I have done a lot of bodyweight exercises, and I look forward to it more because my joints feels really uncomfortable after working out with free weights- especially my shoulders.   So is anybody here who have followed a good bodyweight-based workout routine/program for at least 4 weeks and seen really good results? Like the programs offered by books mentioned in the title? (PS- assuming your nutrition and diet aspect are well under control) "

3271,How to train with grippers to avoid finger joints injuries?,"How to safely train with grippers to avoid problems with fingers and joints?  I've once started training with Heavy Grip 150lbs, which was too hard for me on begin. But after a few weeks I've forced to close it. Probably I was training too intensively for my hands not used to professional grippers, because I've started to have some 'clicks' in smallest finger. The binding of finger was not smooth, as if it was blocked. When the blockade was released, there was such click.  I've read on such forums that the climbers have also problems with that think. This is now over, but I've stopped training with grippers for almost a year and now I'm beginning once again. This time I want to be very cautious.  How should I train in the safe way, to prevent such things to happen again? Should I stop to try to close the gripper and concentrate on endurance not the pure strength? Should I use some supplementary exercises to prevent single-direction strenght training? Or my previous problems were caused by the lack of professional warm-up? "
3272,Can HIIT be done at a lower resistance?,"During the high interval phase, can I do it in a high intensity but low resistance? or the resistance should be also high to be more effective in fat burning?   I've been doing HIIT on elliptical machine and after 5 to 8 cycles of work I felt my legs are sore and couldn't finish the whole workout anymore. Plus I don't want to develop or have huge muscle on my legs, thigh.   So can I do the high intensity phase at a fast speed but low resistance? Will it still be called HIIT? Will the fat burning process still be effective?  "
3273,What precautions to take when running in wintertime?,"What are the precautions one should take when running in wintertime (-2 to -10 Celsius, 28 to 14 F)? I want to know in terms of clothing: what is the most appropriate? Should I end a run close to home so I do not catch a cold due to heavy sweating? Is there a list of what to avoid and what to follow when running in winter? "
3274,should a static shoulder hold feel sore after?,"So I have a bit of shoulder impingement in my right shoulder and I am trying to do some shoulder and rotator cuff stabilization exercises to stregthen and loosen those muscles as Kelly Starrett suggests in this podcast. I am starting out with a relatively low weight, a 25lb kettlebell holding for 3 minutes, twice on each side. I figure that after some practice I will work up to a turkish get up, which seems to be a broader shoulder stability exercise.   My question was, how do I know that I am actually strengthening these muscles using the static holds? I can't seem to figure out how much weight and how many sets I should do. Should I feel sore after a day or something? Should I just hold the kettlebell for like about 70% of my max duration? Should I be increasing the static hold duration each workout or each week?  I want to make sure I start out slowly, so I don't aggravate my shoulder. But I also want to be able to measure my progress. Thanks. "
3275,Improve Timings Running the same Track,"I have been walking/running a 4km track each day for the past 7 days, and always finish in a time period of 30 minutes.  Prior to this, I had not done any regular running before, but I played a regular non-endurance sport about 3 years ago, and occasional running.  I wish to improve by running the track in 25 minutes, but even today, on day 7, I still struggle to complete the 4km track in 30 minutes.  Is it normal to show no improvement after 7 days, and how long does it take to see improvement? (Note:  Obviously the time will vary depending on the person, but is there a normal range?  E.g. Doctors have normal ranges for blood sugar levels even though everyone's blood sugar levels are different.) "
3276,"Pushups for muscle mass, fast or slow?","I'm trying to build my shoulder and chest muscle mass so I've been just doing wide pushups. The problem I'm dealing with right now is how I should do these pushups. Should I push up fast, fall down slowly or just do as much pushups as fast as I can? The latter easily doubles my pushups.  so the question is, quality over quantity? or vice versa? "

3279,combining crossfit with stronglifts - both scheduling and weight intensity,"I am in okay shape, so I decided to join a crossfit box. I have been doing crossfit for about months now, and I really enjoy it. However, I find that I am having trouble doing some of the more strength-intensive movements like pullups and toes-to-bar, etc. So I figured I should start a strength program. Stronglifts seems like a good fit since I am rather new to strength training. I have been doing Stronglifts for about 2 weeks.   I am trying to figure out how best to balance out my schedule to include both of these programs. There are 2 questions here: scheduling and weight level.    I do Stronglifts on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday. Should I do my crossfit workouts on the same days? From a practical standpoint--job--working out twice a day tends to be hard--because I will try to do strength work in the morning and then crossfit in the afternoon. This seems like the most consistent with the Stronglift principles of alternating rest days with strength days. I can maintain this, but I was not sure it was the correct way to go in terms of overdoing it or exhausting myself.  I could do crossfit workouts on my rest days. That is possible, but I did not think that lifting weights for crossfit qualifies as the ""light-moderate cardio"" recommendation for Stronglifts rest days. But this is possible--I just was not sure it was advisable. Should I use lower weights during my crossfit workouts if I am doing Stronglifts? So the Stronglifts website notes that you should not be working at like 80% of your 1RM max. I think that was the point of starting with a lower weight--so that you would not get really sore and then have to skip workouts and such. So if I am lifting weights for strength, should I cut back the weight for crossfit--especially if I am doing both on the same day?   Thanks for any suggestions. "
3280,Routine work-out suggestions,"I used to go the gym since I was 16 then I stopped at 19 because of university (I used to do both martial arts and body building). Now I started again, and it's been one about 8 months since I re-started, I only focus only on body building. So basically i'm try to develop both mass growth and definition (I mean... I'm aware that there's to be some tradeoff between two of them).  I go to the gym at alternate days (like monday-wednesday-friday-sunday-tuesday-thursday-saturday... and i start over).  Broadly in the first day I do both chest and biceps, in the second day triceps and back, third day legs and shoulder, and then I start over.  I've noticed some changes in my body, so I think my work out so far is good, however in the last period i'm noticing that i'm a little stucked with the weight. It's a matter of resistence, as example if with the curl barbell I lift up to 15 kg (I mean performing correctly the exercise up to that weight)  then if I try (as example) to lift 17 kg I still don't have the resistance to complete the exercise, with ""resistance"" I mean that if with the 15 kg i'm able to close correctly my arm (bringing the bar bell almost to touch my chest) when i try to put some weight more i can't close entirely my arm (but i'm still able to do all the repetitions, but not correctly).  Same as some other exercises (not all of them). In case like this is there some kind of support/auxiliary exercise that could be useful to perform? Or some specific training style one could follow? Could be somehow related to the diet too? (maybe a healthier diet, like more protein I don't know... just guess).  I'm just asking for general suggestion and reference. I could give you more details of my work out if you think they could be useful. "
3281,Thickness of gymnastics rings,"I want to buy some wooden gymnastics rings for my home gym. I have found models with 2.8,2.9,3.0,3.1 and 3.2 cm diameter. Since I have small hands my first idea was to go with the 2.8 cm rings. However my Kettlebells have 3.3 cm diameter handles and it works well. Moreover thicker ring handles should have a better pressure distribution on your hands when doing dips.  Are there any disadvantages if I take the 3.2 cm ones even if I have smaller hands? Any other points to consider? "
3282,Workout plans for cutting,"Background  The past 6 months, I've been on a bulking phase, where I've been able to gain about 9kg (from 78kg to 87kg), a mix of muscle and fat.  The past 6 weeks, I've been doing a benchpress program that increased my 1RM by 10%.  I'm now looking to shift into a cutting phase, and lose some of the fat I've gained, while retaining as much of the muscle mass as possible.  Question  Are there any recommended workout plans for one's cutting phase?  My plan is currently as follows:   3-split (legs, push, pull) 5x5 on main exercise each day (not counting warmup sets) switch main exercise every time, or in periods (for instance between flat/incline bench on push day, and between squats/deadlift on leg day)   I obviously want to keep as much of my 1RM as possible, but I concede that it might not be achievable to keep all of it.  Any experiences/tips/ideas/articles?  Thanks in advance! "
3283,Mixing Whey + BCAA + Glutamine,"I'm currently taking my Whey with additional BCAA and Glutamine powders. Some people are skeptical about the benefits, I tested it myself, and for me it works.  I'm a little in doubt with one certain aspect of this mix. Can I mix the ingredients in a small container, and keep it, like a week? Are there any chemical reactions between the BCAA, Glutamine and Whey, when store them together in one container? Instead of keep them separately and only mix them together, right before drinking?  In my opinion, since the three components are all dry powders, I think there is no chemical reaction. But still I'm curious if anyone knows the answer to this problem? "
3284,Taking protein right before the workout,"The label of one protein supplement suggests to have a shake before the workout and one after. I understand having a couple of protein shakes during the day after the workout, but is there any actual benefit from taking it right before you start? Is this a marketing trick to finish your protein quicker?  These are is the ingredients on my current protein:   "
3285,How should I structure my runs if I live in a particularly hilly area?,"I live in a particularly hilly area and have just finished c25k. I have mostly run around the neighbourhood for the past 8 weeks and as a result the vast majority of my runs have incorporated some kind of hill. For example, the elevation on my 5km route looks like this:    Today it occurred to me that it may not be a good idea to run these kinds of hills every run (in my case, 3x a week). How should I be structuring my runs? Is it okay to continue like this, or should I incorporate a flatter run into my route on a regular basis?  As an example, this is a 6.2 km route which is mostly downhill/flat for the first 4.5 km. I usually walk up the hill for the last 1.2km or so. This route is for when I want to have an easier run that's more flat or downhill.   "
3286,Safe use of minitramp to develop hip and lower leg/for mobility in older deconditioned subjects,"I've read high praise for this activity, and tried it a little bit in a gym. Not many people seem to do it. A good minitramp is very expense. Is it worthwhile to acquire one? How can it be used safely at home, I.e. balance issues?   I'm thinking that you can simulate walking  but with less impact on ankle, knee, hip joints and with some stretching element.  "
3287,Calories to consume on workout days,"I did a calorie calculator to see how many calories I should consume in a day. I'm getting between 1,300-1,500 in a day. So, on days I work out, like today, I burned around 500-600 calories. Should I cut that off of my 1300 calories and consume more food on those days? Or should I just stay at 1300 without taking off the extra calories I burned this morning? "
3288,Why can't I do barbell curls?,"I am able to do, with heavier weights, concentration curl, hammer curl, and preacher curl with little difficulty, but when I do barbell curls I get exhausted or it's like there is no stamina in me. I think I involve my upper back and, due to lack of muscle and strength there, I feel tired. I heard that neurons are released when we get used to an exercise and we are able to perform it efficiently. What can you say on this matter?  Can running daily or a day in week increase my stamina? I am tall about 5 feet and inches. "
3289,Exercises for Neck Pain,"I've had non-specific, subclinical neck pain for about four years (otherwise, I'm in great physical shape.) I'm sure the pain is because of my computer use - like I'm doing at this moment.  I'm wondering what exercises other people might have found to help relieve or prevent neck pain?  Are you doing exercises for cervical strengthening, endurance, motor control? Are you doing exercises for your cervical flexors, extensors, or both?  Are you getting manual therapy? Are you stretching?  Are you using elastic bands? What works? "
3290,"New to running, beginner questions","I need to pass a fitness test that involves being able to run X distance in Y minutes. I've never done any running before (have always hated it, when I've had to for school, etc.), so I'm well and truly a beginner. I've done some research online regarding proper posture, training regimes, etc. The posture stuff seemed relevant and interesting, but most of the training advice seems geared at people with more experience and who have long term goals/plans for running. I just need to pass this test.   On a treadmill, I'm doing 10km/hour right now and lasting about 1.5ks (~9 minutes). I guess my questions are:   Should I focus on distance or time first? i.e. would it be better to keep the 10km/hour rate and try and last longer and longer (i.e. stretching that 9 minutes out until I can keep going for longer) and then try to go faster, or try and go faster until I hit my target speed and then try last longer? Is there any harm to running every day? Assuming unlimited time and motivation (ha! neither are unlimited, but I'm going to try...), if I run every day is that great or is that just going to be counter productive? (i.e. I do weights training, and for that, training every day is a bad idea because you need to give your muscles time to rest. General recommendations are no more than 2-3 times a week).   I run on a treadmill in a gym, because it's comfortable, and the scientist in me likes analyzing data (i.e. I like seeing exactly how many meters I ran, how long I'm running for, what my heart rate is, etc). How well does running on a treadmill translate to real life running? Is it okay to stick to the treadmill or should I really get onto a real running track asap? My limit seems mostly cardio related, and not muscle related. I.e. when I have to stop, it's because I'm out of breath, and not so much because my legs are tired. My legs were a bit sore after the first run, but haven't been since. Are there any other supporting exercises I can do that will help with cardio, or is just running itself the best I'm going to get?  "
3291,Why isn't barefoot squatting recommended?,"I've been doing StrongLifts 5x5 program for past one-and-half month. Currently my squat has just crossed my bodweight. And my deadlift is 10kgs more than my squat. My goal is to squat 2 times my bodyweight and deadlift 2.5 times my bodyweight.  I squat ass-to-ground and I've been doing all exercises barefoot on a concrete floor covered with 1/2 inch rubber padding. I don't have any mobility issues and so far I didn't face problems of any kind. Can I safely continue like this? Even Arnold did the same:     It also makes me wonder, if going barefoot is safe then why would people always recommend weightlifting shoes? I'm bit confused. Honestly I cannot afford weightlifting shoes. I have running shoes but I read that running shoes are worse than barefoot.  I don't know if this has anything to do with going barefoot. But after today's workout, I'm feeling a burning sensation in my feet. I read online that it could be due to Vitamin B12 deficiency (and I was recommended Vitamin B12 in the past, though not for the same reason) "
3292,Does the ease of downhill running cancel out the extra work of uphill running?,"Running uphill is obviously more challenging than running on a flat surface, but on a hilly course, there is also an equal amount of downhill. If my goal is to have the hardest workout, burn the most calories, etc - does the downhill cancel out the uphill? Do I burn fewer calories running downhill than on a flat surface? Does that cancel out the extra calories I burn running uphill? If so, are there other benefits of running on a hilly course, besides added caloric burn? "
3293,Which part of forehead should touch water first when breastroking?,"When swimming breaststroke, which park of forehead is actually expected to touch the water first?   I fear when my head dips into water, I'm breaking too much. When my head dips under water, which part of forehead should I aim to hit water first? Directly above the eyes, or with more deeper movement, with the higher part of my head?  "
3294,Would Training with same volume on cutting phase as on bulking result in loss of muscle?,For the first time I am going to start a cutting phase so i have a number of questions:   Q1:Would Training with same volume on cutting phase as on bulking result in loss of muscle to provide energy to my body to continue training? Q2:How much cardio should i do everyday and which one should i do hit for 10mins or 60mins walk? Q3:Should i train with progesssive overload as i did on bulking phase.?  
3295,Is warmup before lifting really necessary in real world outside the gym?,"I'm doing StrongLifts 5x5 for close to two months now. I'm happily making steady progress. All the excitement of lifting personal best weight every other day in gym got diluted last week.  I wanted to improve my number of pullups from 6 to 12, so I started a 30 day 'The Fighter Pullup By Pavel' last week. Because rest time between sets isn't mentioned in the program, I adopted Grease To The Groove method (spreading sets through out the day), as per Pavel's suggestion in one of his forums. After 2 days into the program, in one of the sets, I didn't do any warmup and got my shoulder-tricep area injured. Its painful but that is not what I am worried about the most, I'm giving it some rest and it will be cured.  What worries me is doing a simple pullup without warmup injured me. I'm currently Squatting 1.3 times and deadlifting 1.5 times my bodyweight. Do these numbers mean anything outside in realword? Because when I need to lift a heavy object or another person of comparable (or bit less) weights in gym, it is ridiculous to do incremental warmup sets before. It simply isn't possible. Does that mean I'll get injured?  One of the motivations for getting stronger is to lift my girl friend, who is of my current body weight. One cannot say that I need to warmup everytime before lifting her. Is warmup before lifting really necessary in real world outside the gym? How do these lifting numbers inside gym translate into real world? What is the safe weight I can lift outside gym without warmup ? "
3296,XC Skiing as Cross Training for Running,I would like to Cross Country Ski this winter as cross training for my next Marathon. My question is if I can ski for a number of hours and will this impact my normal run training? My last marathon I ran 50-60 miles per week but I would like to add some other exercise types to my next cycle of training.   Do I need more than one complete rest day or can I run a long day then ski for a number hours? 
3297,What to do during a week off?,I am feeling pretty battered and reckon I really need to take a week off from lifting weights.  What are some things I should take into consideration?  Should I adjust my diet? Eat less? Eat less protein? More vegetables?  Is doing some light cardio going to get in the way? 
3298,Why does every calorie tracking app give a different target calorie count for the same goals?,"I'm trying to improve my diet and exercise more. My personality is one that responds well to number-juggling systems, so I'm thought I should try those calorie-tracking apps you can get on smartphones.  I installed three of them (MyFitnessPal, MyPlate, MyNetDiary) to try them out and see which I liked best.  I entered the same info into all three (5'6"" male, 31 years old, 256 lbs, desk job, targeting 1lbs lost per week). But they all recommend different daily calorie targets, with a difference of >600 calories/day between the highest (MyNetDiary) and the lowest (MyPlate).  Why are these recommendations so different? Is there really this much controversy over how many calories a person burns in a day? Which benchmark should I trust? "
3299,Holding Deadlifts at the Top,"I don't have a specific photo to share but often when I watch powerlifters do deadlifts, they regularly pause at the top on the last rep.  Why? Feeling proud of yourself and looking in the mirror? Or is there a reason for this: grip, lat training, conditioning, etc.? "
3300,What are the implications of diminishing levels of soreness in Delayed Onset Muscle Soreness (DOMS)?,"A while back, I sent out the following query to a subject matter expert (through a different social media platform), but did not receive a reply.  Thought I'd post it here to see if anyone with expertise on Delayed Onset Muscle Soreness (DOMS) can answer it.  What I wrote earlier follows:  Lately, I’ve been unable to produce DOMS from my weightlifting sessions. I’ve always thought that if I’m not sore the next day, I wasted my time at the gym. Now I know some believe that you don’t have to experience DOMS for muscle growth, but where is the science on that theory? Regardless, some of my theories as to why I’m not experiencing DOMS are listed below:   I’ve reached some sort of pre-determined genetic threshold in how much I can tear my muscles. The effects of weightlifting diminish once you go past a certain     chronological age (e.g., 20s vs. 30s vs. 40s and upward). I tend to include some amount of cardio during my weightlifting     sessions, perhaps flushing out any lactic acid built up during the     weightlifting (but I’ve read that lactic acid build-up isn’t what     causes DOMS). I’m not currently taking a multi-vitamin. Right now I take in a fair     amount of Vitamin C on a regular basis, but no multi-vitamin. Before     a workout, I’ll take vitamin C and selenium. I’m also taking a new     brand of iodine called Tri-Iodine by Terry Naturally (albeit     sporadically). It contains 3 forms of iodine – potassium iodide,     sodium iodide, and molecular iodine. I consume far less sugar than I did in 2012. In 2012, my sugar     averaged 83 grams/day; in 2013, it was 75 grams. My goal is to get     it lower than that in 2014.  (It averaged 63 g/day in 2014.)  What’s     the relationship between sugar in the diet, inflammation, DOMS, and     the ability to grow muscle?   Having said all that, I took a couple of long breaks from my typical workouts while focusing on other projects/activities and have recently begun exercising on a regular basis again.  The first break was a period of five weeks and even after that long break, I felt as if I had retained a significant amount of strength despite the break.  DOMS produced from workouts was present but not intense.  The exercise phase that followed the five-week break was 14 weeks in duration followed by a rest period of 13 weeks.  After this last break of 13 weeks, I am now exercising regularly again.  I feel significant strength has been lost and DOMS is easily attained from far more simple and less grueling workouts.  My conclusion from all of this is that, genetically, we all have a peak and as we approach that peak, we are less and less likely to feel the effects of DOMS.  Without steroids, a person's muscle growth has a limit and additional amounts of exercise either through load or volume will have increasingly diminishing effects.  I don't think this conclusion is much of a revelation, but I would be interested in knowing if any of the aspects I have suggested have an impact on DOMS and whether or not researchers have conducted any studies on these aspects as they relate to DOMS. "
3301,Protein shakes for weight loss,"I have recently started regular swimming with the main goal of weight loss. Im curious as to whether protein shakes would help me lose weight?  Increased muscle growth burns calories but then the shakes would add them to my diet?  EDIT: in response to the comments; By lose weight I really mean ""Become less fat"". I'm more than happy for some of the fat to turn into muscle Building muscle isn't my primary goal though.  I swim for 30 min 5 times a week with reasonable intensity (I'm tired afterwards) "
3302,Can you built back muscles you have lost?,I have read so much about diets that warning that not eating adequate amounts of protein will result in muscle loss. On the other hand I see people like Christian Bale almost flaunting this rule going up and down the built_rake-thin scale multiple times successfully.   Is it true that muscles lost is lost forever ? If so how do people like him do it ? When I see him in the Machinist I don't think his frame just shows water loss from muscles only right ? 
3303,Faced with an enormous Performance Dip,"I'm a starting runner (been running for approx. just 2 years now) and I'm currently faced with an immense dip in my training performances.  Let me start my story 2 months back. Beginning in September I ran my first Half-Marathon. It was not an exceptional time (02u03m), but, I ran it without pain and feeling (too) exhausted. After the race I took 2 weeks of rest with a recuperation-run before training for my next race which was the second week of October. There I ran 14.5km , again without forcing myself, and even setting a PR for the 10k. After the race I took some time again to recuperate.  But ever since that race, nothing seems to work. Every training has become a challenge (even the recuperation &amp; lsd-runs).  My legs/feet feel extremely tired and often a slight (fatigue-)pain is felt. For example, last Saturday I trained in the woods/hills. Having rested 3 days before the training I assumed my legs would have been recovered. But after no less than 7 kilometers my legs started to beg for a pause. I pushed through but eventually gave in at KM 12. I stopped for 5 minutes before continuing for another 3 km. The tempo during the training was good (fell within the margins) but my legs felt awful.  I'm getting plenty of sleep, eat appropriately, stopped running intervals, doing less mileage, monitor my heart rate during runs,... yet somehow I'm not getting the desired feel in the legs (like in September/beginning of October).  Has anyone encountered the same problem? Is it all in my head? I'm desperate for any tips/pointers/advice.  Thank you for your time. "
3304,Why can't i do pull ups And Why i feel loss of hearing after push ups?,"I am able to do chin-ups for about 3 reps. But when I try to do pull-ups, I can't lift myself up. Why is that? These are same exercises which works almost the same muscles. Does anyone have an explanation for this?  Also, when I do pushups, then after I am done, I feel like I have a loss of hearing for a short time. Is it normal or is this a breathing problem during exercise? "
3305,How do you know what intensity you should go with?,"I've started working out several month ago at home. I'm building my own training routines and using mostly Super-sets. (as for the equipment I use dumbbells, exercise bands and body weight).  Mostly I use 5-6 sets of 2 exercies (a super set). I perform each set twice.  The objective is full-body exercise while building the core and muscles.  The problem is I don't know if I workout too much or too little... How would one know that?  Sometimes I can't finish a routine and sometimes it's too easy. Sometimes if I don't eat much carbs before the routine - I break in the middle (feel deep fatigue and can't move).  Ideas? :)  Thanks!  EDIT: I've been asked to elaborate more on my goals.  I'm looking to beef up a little and shape up. I've got a pretty average body structure - 1.81 m / 90kg (little over weight).  So the goal is to lose some weight (fat) and gain more muscle.  I'd like to get a great core (health, posture, muscle) and more strength with toning (arms, chest) "
3306,Unable to keep lower back straight during Romanian Deadlift,"When performing Romanian Deadlifts (currently RPE of 8-10), I'm pretty much unable to keep my lower back straight after a few reps.  In regular Deadlifts I don't have that issue (probably because the weight is set on the ground for a second or so after each rep). On the Romanian Deadlift however, my back starts to round pretty soon. Although my hamstrings and glutes feel like they could deal a lot more weight (or reps), I then always have to stop in order to not hurt my back longterm.  Is that normal? I'm now training for roughly 1,5 years. What can be done about it? "
3307,Are there any compelling reasons to not engage in bare-foot weight lifting,"As I understand it there is a general recommendation towards wearing weight lifting shoes when lifting heavy weights for three main reasons:   Less compression in a weight lifting shoe's than in a normal training shoe A more favourable angle for a more 'upright' position(surely just a more hips forward position) General support of the foot   One of my goals through lifting (I am referring to barbell Olympic-style lifts) is to strengthen the musculature and connective tissues of the hands and wrists. As such I opt to not wear wraps or gloves when lifting, which I imagine will at some point limit the amount I can safely lift (but not for some time).  By extension I wonder if there is development of the muscles of the foot, ankle, and shins to be gained from unsupported feet.  Has anyone experimented with this? Are there compelling reasons not to embark on shoeless weight lifting? It seems that the first feature of a weight lifting shoe would be provided by a raw heel, and the third seems subject to the same caveats as bare-foot running.  I'm particularly interested to hear from experienced lifters who would be willing to experiment with lifting without shoes and give their thoughts. "
3308,Deadlift form with less than 45 lb plates?,"I've been working out for a while and just began to add deadlifts to my routine on back day. My problem is that I can't deadlift much. Mainly because I'm 400 lb and my knees aren't the best, I generally only get 25lb plates on the bar max. I don't use the shorter bar because the one at my gym is broken.  Anyway, I've read that proper deadlift form should have you either tap the weight on the ground or near tap it, but that's usually with a 45 plate on the bar. If I'm going with less weight, should I start my lift higher? And also should I stop my descent lower, as though I had 45s on the bar? "
3309,Lifting with minimal extension,"Every morning while at the gym, there is a fellow whom always lifts in an ..peculiar style to me. He doesn't do extreme amounts of weight, very doable for full extension in per-say a dumbbell chest press. However, instead of the typical down to your chest and back up form, he holds the dumbbells straight out, and almost does a jerking motion, moving his arms at most an inch, over and over. He continues to use this same less than an inch method with every other exercise he performs in the gym, be in, pull ups (moving his head up 1 inch and back down), to wrist curls of an inch.  Is there any kind of benefit to this technique? or is this just his...special way of doing things? "
3310,Multi stage fitness test indoors training?,"In a few months, I will need to score as high as I can on a Multi-stage fitness test, or ""beep test"". I'm a 20 year old male weighting 165 pounds and measuring 6 feet 3 inches. I've never really been in shape or much of a sports guy for my whole life.  I started running a few weeks ago and that was okay but now winter is fully here and I have trouble running outdoors. I'd like to start going to the gym to train for this, but I have a hard time deciding what to do. I used to do the Couch to 5K thing (didn't get very far though) but I find that hard to reproduce on a threadmill, and I'm not sure if it would be the bset form of training for the beep test. I also tried the threadmill's ""cardio"" training and found it boring (it maxes at 4.5 mph, maybe I just need to do it longer?). I can easily get my hands on the MP3 file for the beep test but that's not much of help if I don't have the room (20 meters no less) to run it.  A friend suggested spinning, but I'm not sure if that'd help. I'd like to work on the leg muscles for running as well as my cardio.  What indoors training (in a gym) can I do to help me on this test? "
3311,Foods for gaining muscle for a new gym guy,"I am going to gym and doing weight lift and other exercise for last three months,my target is to gain weight and muscle.Unfortunately I didnt gain weight and my muscle didnt increase(bicep and tricep is getting shape and muscles are getting harder).  I eat sufficient amount of food daily with meat and vegetables.Also taking Soy Protein for weeks.  Any specific advice to gain muscle and weight?  Can I take protein shake now,I am assuming I am not getting enough protein for body.  Many people says gym beginner can not take protein shake,is it true?  Thanks in advance. "
3312,Do I have to workout harder and harder?,"About a year and a half ago (and having quit smoking six months prior) I decided to lose weight because my bathroom scale told me that I was on the lower end of the ""obese"" category. Since then, through a mild but strictly-kept diet (cut off sugar completely, kept bread and similar products to a vanishingly small amount) and a less sedentary life style (doing things like taking the stairs instead of the elevator, taking frequent hour-long walks, occasional cycling or jogging, and occasional light body-weight workouts) I managed to reach the lower end of the ""overweight"" category.  Although the weight loss was consistent, it was also quite slow. So I started working out more seriously in the past two months or so. I do a light home workout 2-3 times a week, mostly body-weight like lunges, push-ups etc. but I also use a pair of dumbbells for the muscles that are hard to target with such exercises. I also run 5-6 kilometers once or twice a week. I've been quite persistent and I'm seeing a nice improvement: I've lost 6 kg in the past six weeks or so. I'm now very close to my recommended normal weight and feel quite healthy.   Both of my workout methods (home exercise and running) takes about 30-40 minutes per session. That's about the most I want to spend. But I'm near the point where it feels almost too easy. I don't want to increase reps or the distance because I don't want to put more time in it. I know I can, for instance, try harder variants of pushups, increase weights, or run faster but my question is precisely that: Do I have to?  The main reason I workout is to have better health. Appearance is a secondary consideration for me. What if I kept my current training schedule ad infinitum even if becomes easier and easier to do? To be honest, I don't like working out very much. But 30 to 40 minutes per day is something I can do forever, especially if it doesn't exhaust me. Is it still beneficial? Or how much less beneficial will it become in time? "
3313,What is difference between Yoga and Power Yoga?,How do you differentiate between Yoga and Power-Yoga? What are the key differences between them?  How should one maintain intake of food before or after doing yoga? Can both types be done on the same day?  Where on the internet (or from any other offline source) can I learn Power Yoga on my own?  
3314,Normative ratio between squat and lunge?,"I squat and deadlift with a barbell regularly. I know how much I can lift with variants of those exercises on a given day. I'd like to use that knowledge to better understand how much I should expect to lift with a weighted lunge.  What is the normative ratio between a lifter's squat and their lunge?  We know these relationships, in broad strokes and with some caveats, between other lifts. The front squat and back squat, the squat and the deadlift, the deadlift and the power clean, and so on all have known relationships consisting of a range of ratios. For instance, a power clean between 40 and 60 percent of one's deadlift is to be expected, and most people's front squat is generally about 80% of their back squat. So: what lunge is to be expected if one can squat X?  Any type of loaded squat and any type of loaded lunge is acceptable, but please be specific: e.g. ""barbell back squat to forward-stepping lunge with a barbell across the shoulders"" or ""barbell front squat to rearward-stepping lunge with dumbbells in the hands"". Anecdotes welcome but data welcome more. "
3315,No access to gym for a month,"I have been in gym for 3 months. It's quite rewarding, while I will travel to another place for one month during which I have no access to gym.   My question is, during the one month, what can I do to ensure that I am ready for exercises when I return and that I am not too out of shape? What I can think of is some self-weight leg exercises and pushups. Nothing else.  Advice on diet is also welcomed.   I am 5'10'' and around 150 pounds. My goal is to be more muscular but not too much bigger. I put even time on each part of my body so I don't have something specific to work on.   Any help?  "
3316,How much cardio for someone with an athletic build?,"For someone who is skinny, has an athletic build, and is trying to put on weight through strength training, how much cardio should they include in their workout?  Currently, my workout routine is something along the lines of:   Monday: chest and back Tuesday: kendo Wednesday: shoulders, biceps, triceps Thursday: pylometrics Friday: legs and back Saturday / Sunday: either yoga, pylometrics or rest (usually rest)   My concern is, with the intense hour long kendo and pylometrics workouts, I am burning away too much of my weight, and my strength training isn't growing as much as it could because of this.  Is this a realistic concern? Should I reduce the amount of cardio I do each week, or is cardio important in strength training even for skinny people? "
3317,Positions and variations in stomach vacuum,I'd like to enhance my stomach vacuum routine. What are the alternatives and differences for the stomach vacuum exercise? 
3318,"What kind of exercise can I do while having neck, shoulder and back pain?","About 2 weeks ago I started having really annoying pain in the neck, shoulders and to lesser extent back. I think the immediate cause could have been sleeping in draught under inadequate cover and clothing. I went to an osteopath, but it made things worse :(  What should I do about exercises in this case? They seem to help immediately after (probably when the muscles are warm), but its seems to be worse afterwards (e.g. next morning). Should I train nevertheless? Or just do light stuff, e.g. strolls? Or try to move as little as possible? (I am still waiting for my doctor's appointment)   Also are there any creams or supplements that could help? Does massage or hot bath help (to get rid of it - it does bring some immediate relief)?  My overall fitness level is low at the moment, I was just trying to get back in shape :( "
3319,How Can I avoid Plateau?,"I am workingout about 6 weeks. I don't want to hit plateau. My question is I have to change the workouts am doing or I have to increase the weight to make a change in my routine??  Example : I am currently doing benchpress (incline + decline )  and dumbell press ( incline + decline )....  now what can I do?? I have to change the workout or the weight???  or rep and sets...??   I am so skinny, weight is about 52kg and my height is 5'5"". am eighteen years old.  I want to gain a lot of muscles.   I go to the GYM 3days in a week. Sunday - Tuesday - Thursday.     I do 4-5 exercises for a single muscle group.  I try to lift hravy all the time. I do 5 sets of each exercise and try to do 5-8 reps in each sets...   6 months ago I think I was plateaued,  and then I left the gym...   and now I joined the gym again...   So this time I want to be aware  about plateau.  So I want to change the routine in every month to make sure that I'm not doing anything bad..... "
3320,Accurately Calibrated Plates,Various manufacturers of Olympic and weightlifting plates use different standards for accuracy.  Is there a good resource for comparing price versus accuracy?  Can anyone suggest some manufacturers and supply some reasonably trustworthy data as to their plates' accuracy? 
3321,Focussing on burning calories and six pack abs and an overall change,"My native language is not English so I apologize if some terms are not correctly stated.  I regularly go to the gym twice a week. What I do there is 10 minutes crosstrainer, leg press, chest press, stiff arm lat pulldowns, cable curls, pushdowns and shoulder press. I do this 3 sets with 15 repeats. The day after my gym day ( I make a break of 1 day between each gym day ) I execute this abs training. I trained for 4 month now and got a feeling for the gym and the exercises. Now what I aim to change. I want to burn more calories and get my sixpack abs on :D ( my height is 1.68m or 5'6 and I weigh 67kilograms at the moment ). What can I change to make those changes? The reason Why I posted the other stuff that isn't abs related, because I really don't know much about training plans and if somebody would suggest some change or some additions I would be open to it! This is just a training plan from some app I got from the app store :) "
3322,Sites that create personalized workout routine based on target weight?,"Are there sites (free or otherwise) that will create a workout routine based on what your target goal is?  For example, my girlfriend (who's heavyset and does weights) measures 5'8"" and weighs about 170. She told me she wants to gain healthy weight and weigh between 190-200 pounds. She currently goes to the gym and has a normal fat percentage.  What site can assign a good routine (exercise and diet, I guess) that will allow her to reach that target weight? Basically, it would be a site where she inputs all her current data (height, weight, fat %, etc) and with that specific information, assign a real routine.  Thanks. "
3323,Squat /Deadlift with torn ACL?,"I tore my left knee ACL 6 months playing soccer. After the incident I was able to go to a Dr and he told me I need to let the inflammation come down and then get surgery. He said I don't need to do the surgery to live a healthy life but if I want to play sports with twists and turns (like soccer, basketball, etc) I will need the surgery.  The Dr told me I could run, jog, swim, and do many other things with a missing ACL. And I am doing all those right now. He said before the surgery I should strengthen my leg muscles because it will improve recovery post-surgery.   I do plan on getting the surgery (sometime in the future) but I just want to know if squats and deadlifts are one of those things that its okay to do with a torn ACL? Technically your moving up and down in those exercises, no twists or turns, but is the weight and pressure at all harmful on this part of the leg/locomotion system given a missing ACL?  I just started lifting since the incident and I just want to know. I recently relocated and will be seeing a Dr soon about this but until then... "
3324,Non-Dairy Protein Powder (And Some Concerns),"Not sure where to post this (here or the Vegan page, but since it's about weight lifting, I'll start here:)  So I know it's been asked a lot, but I have some slightly different information that I would like to bring to the table. Please bare with me.  I am not a vegan (I eat meat) but I am severely allergic to dairy products and all of it's derivatives (ie: whey, casein, milk, etc.). That eliminates many options for me right from the start. So, my next option is to try vegan proteins. Typically there aren't any milk derivatives in them.  My next order of business is this: I have looked into vegan proteins for quite some time. I have tried a couple (GNC had a vegan gainer at one point, Vega, Garden of Life to name a few). But I stumbled upon a site called the clean label project. Here they talk about heavy metals (arsenic, mercury, lead, etc.) being in many proteins, including many of my vegan options. I can't post full links, but below is what it will let me post:  staging-cleanlabelproject.kinsta.com  After looking into this, and thinking about it, doing more research into the credibility of the site, I am now stuck. I have heard mixed reviews of the credibility of the studies done on the site. But if I am to take it seriously, then I am looking for a vegan protein (or other protein source such as egg, or maybe even beef) that would contain as little heavy metals as possible (ideally) that would also be non-dairy.  Note: before this gets brought up: there is no medicine I can take to be able to have a dairy protein. It's not a lactose intolerance, but something worse. It's called galactosemia for those who want to know. This basically leaves me with either a vegan protein or a egg or beef (or some other) protein source.  I was wondering what would be my best option? As far as the credibility of the site and the study, has anybody else seen this? And if so, has it been proven or dis-proven?  Sorry for the long post. Any help or resources or advice would be appreciated. Thanks "
3325,Why didn't 5x5 work for my pullups?,"Despite being reasonably well-trained in the past, I always sucked at pull-ups. At the beginning of this summer, I started training again. In the beginning, my max was only 1-2 clean pull-ups (I am 175 cm and 85 kg and I'd like to stay around this weight).  At first, I started doing 5 sets of 5 pull-ups 3x a week. Because I could not do 5 clean pull-ups, once I felt I could not do one more pull-up, I did negatives to complete the set. So usually my five sets would look like 3 pullups + 2 negatives, then 2 + 3, 2 + 3, 1 + 4 or similar. I tried to improve each training by doing more pull-ups and less negatives.  During the same training, I would also do parallel bar dips (more on that later).  This worked, but progress was quite slow, I progressed from being able to do 5 pull-ups in (only) my first set after 2 months, but I still felt like I'm struggling with it.  To compare this with dips, where my max was also only 1-2 at the beginning, with roughly the same program, after the same time, I was doing 10,10,10,8,8 easily, so I started using additional weight.  Then, I switched to doing pull-ups 5-6 days a week, something similar to GTG. I decided to set a target volume for each day depending on how I felt. In a couple of days I ramped up to 10 sets of 3-5 a day. After a week, I was easily doing 12 sets of 5 a day, and I feel like my pull-up strength has skyrocketed. I think, what made it work are two details, first, not going over the target even if I feel like I could do more, second, using a variety of grips (parallel, overhand, false grip on rings) to keep my elbow happy.  As after 2 weeks of this, I feel great, no signs of exhaustion or pain, I plan to continue with the same volume for 1-2 more weeks, then switch to something more focused on endurance, as my goal is to get 20 clean pull-ups.  My question is:  Why did 5x5 work not so well for pull-ups for me? It seems to me, that in the beginning, volume is the main driver for progress, so being able to do more total volume means faster progress.  But then, why was it different for dips, and why is it different for barbell training? "
3326,Difficulty breathing in push-up position,"I've been out of shape for several years, but finally starting to get back into exercising.  I've been doing pretty heavy aerobic exercises for the past two months. For the most part, I'm doing ok - not in tip-top shape yet, but definitely doing a lot better than I have in years.  One thing that still gets me - whenever I try to do push-ups (or anything else where I'm facing the floor), I seem to have a lot of trouble. It's hard to describe, but it just seems like I'm not able to breathe right, and I lose energy fast. I can run, jump, do all kinds of things standing up, but as soon as I hit the floor I'm only good for a few seconds before I crash or have to stand up.  Is this common, or indicative of any problem? Or do you think it's just something I need to work through and gradually learn how to overcome?  Thanks "
3327,"Should I have protein shakes the next day after workout, or only right after workout?","I worked out today and I had a whey protein shake after this workout. I don't plan to work out tomorrow, but I was wondering, should I still have another protein shake to help with the muscle soreness?  In other words, should I take whey protein only when I work out, or should I take it as long as my muscles are sore?  What about casein protein? "
3328,Why do calories matter for weight gain/loss?,"I know this is a basic question but please bear with me.   Why is it that total calories consumed matters so much for losing weight or gaining weight, no matter if it’s fat or muscle?  Calories measure the energy that goes in through your mouth. Weight gain or loss is a measure of the total mass (or weight) of your body. So why is the total energy in through your mouth the best indicator of whether your body will gain or lose mass?  Of course I do understand that if you’re not getting enough energy in through your mouth, then your body will burn energy stored in fat or muscle, and then that will decrease your weight. I get that.   But I what I don’t get is why these other factors are not significant:   the energy in through your lungs, by breathing the mass in through your mouth, which would be measured in grams not calories the mass that goes out of my body, when I poop the energy that goes out of my body, when I poop potential variation in the above two quantities, if for instance the human body “keeps” more or less of what it eats depending on its needs, its preferences, its general efficiency, etc..   If the conventional way of thinking based on calorie counting works (as it seems to do!), then as an empirical matter all these other factors I list must be negligible. But what I want to understand is why. "
3329,What is the maximum weight which adjustable dumbell handles can take?,"Recently I haven't had much time to go to the gym so I decided to buy my own dumbells. I quickly realized adjustable dumbells are more cheaper than normal dumbells. I came across this: [website]Now my question is, is there a maximum weight which each handle can take? As you can see, the link above comes with 4-5lbs, 4-3lbs and 2-4lb handles. I was thinking about putting all the weight on one handle.   By this, I mean:  On one handle, put 2-5lb weights on each side (that makes 20lbs), then put 1-3lb weight on each side (so 26lbs) and with the handle weighing 4 lbs, in total it would be 30lbs (which is a good start off for me).  After, I plan on buying two more weighted plates, each weighing 10lbs. That way, on one dumbell handle, I can have: 2-5lbs and 1-10lb weight on each side, which would make 40lbs of weight on the dumbell handle.  My question is, how do I know if the handle is made to take 40lbs on one handle? Last thing I want is the handle breaking and the weights falling on me. "
3330,Can you effectively put on mass while being highly active/fit?,"It's believed by some that too much fitness destroys muscle. How can one know that line? Some arguments point to long-distance runners/marathon runners as an example, which are not known to be the most muscular people, but are usually developed well and are quite lean.   I ask because I'm trying to be both very fit and athletic, but want to keep building muscle at the same time. People have told me crazy things like claims that I should avoid cardio altogether because cardio supposedly drains or ""saps"" muscle away directly. I'm not talking about excessive cardio -- these claims point to any cardio and claim that it ""burns muscle"" even if done very mildly.  For example, I saw a thread (BB.com) where people trying to put on size were actively NOT doing any cardio/fitness beyond weight training, and strictly avoided it out of fear of muscle loss from it.  I mean things like running/jogging, plyometrics, sports, etc. Some said how ""out of shape"" it made them. I foolishly believed this to be true, and now I feel incredibly out of shape as well.  I basically cut down things like running until I eventually just did weight training, and I feel out of breath now on the first set. Back when I did loads of cardio I never felt out of breath and still felt strong/etc., but feared that all of the sports/cardio I was doing would be halting the progress of muscle gains.  So what's the conclusion here? Can most people generally be highly fit and put on+maintain muscle?  I mean ""highly fit"" like being able to run a 5K and still bench three plates while looking built. A lot of those ""big guys"" tend to have loads of power, but look like they're out of breath after 10 reps at 50%.  I don't want to be built and muscular if I'm going to be an out of shape lardass -- I want both worlds.  Now I'm trying to get back in good shape again, but struggling to find the right balance. I used to easily run at least one mile a day, every single day -- and do 50-100 box jumps a day with no problems.  How can I know the fine line between ""too fit and a risk for effectively building muscle"" and ""building muscle, but still can run and not get tired easily?"" I've read conflicting studies, reports, anecdotes, and etc. I'm lost and don't know how hard I should push to be fit while keeping certain that I'm not ""sapping"" muscle away. My diet is fine, and I certainly know that more active means more food needs.  Am I worrying for nothing or what should I/others need to take note of in these endeavors?  Note that I don't only do cardio/steady-state stuff, but also plyometrics/jumping, springing/HIIT, bodyweight exercises, sports, cycling/bike riding and other explosive, heart-tapping exercises. "
3331,lower back pain after running,"I started a program to run 30' after 8 weeks. I am in week 2. I am overweight in 20 kilograms  The problem that I have is a pain in my lower back.  Is not shortly after the training, I feel the pain when I sit for too long (I am a programmer). Then I feel the pain as I get up I start to walk.  So, What I am doing wrong? Should I see a doctor? "
3332,Squatting a day after Deadlift,"In my Push Pull Leg Split, I'll be doing Deadlift on Pull day and next day, i.e leg day, I'll be doing Squats. Is there any problem doing this? Will you get any injury due to both have a great presure on your spine and enough recovery time is not given? "
3333,Strengthening muscles absorbing shock by running downhill,"I've rapidly increased my running endurance this year. For the last years I was running max 12 km, in this year I've broken half marathon, and I've started trail running. After one run with 600 meter elevation, I've got some clicking sounds in knees next day (without any pain) which I interpret as warning signal.   Running uphill was perfectly comfortable (thought exhausting), but running downhill was a struggle with gravity that accelerated me to move legs much faster I'm used to. I suppose also it was an overwhelming experience for muscles stabilizing my knees.  What exercises can I use to strenghten that muscles and prepare them for the downhill shock? Interval sprints to make them prepared for higher velocities? Thinks like vew-do?  "
3334,Is wearing Langot necessary to do Push ups at home?,I have been doing home workout routine of 100 Decline push ups and 50 diamond push ups. I have been wearing a Langot (loin Cloth) to cover my testicles from any harm since I stared working out 10 years ago. So my question is do I need to wear the Langot even for my home push up work out? I want to stop wearing it. Will it harm my testicles if I do push ups without a Langot at home? 
3335,"Can fitness be ""regained"" like muscle can with muscle memory?","I've heard people say that, if you're seriously trained and take a small break, you may lose strength, but the ability to get it back is beyond that of a lesser trained individual. In other words, if you take a few weeks off, you can probably get back to where you were in just one week's time max.  Is fitness this way too? If you were once very fit, is it easier to become equally as fit once again?  Because some people discuss how hard it is to get fit from step one. If you were and have been highly fit all of your life and take a set back of a few months, can you get fit again in a shorter time than when you, say, first ever became fit? I know because I've read of people who regained muscle quicker.  Basically, sort of like how muscles can adapt quicker if they've been used for long periods of time.  The question that's claimed to be similar to this one fails to address the cardiovascular aspect of training. I expected insightful answers regarding cardiovascular adaptation, not muscular adaptation. "
3336,Weight Loss without the gym,I need to reduce my belly fat but due to certain unavoidable reasons I do not have access to a gym. What should I do? Where should I start?  
3337,What to eat after a night workout right before sleep?,"Due my working times (software engineer), I tend to workout at times between 20 and 21 o'clock. And finish 22 o'clock.  Firs thing I do is to drink my whey isolate protein shake and then I go home. After that, I need relax a little bit and I don't have a lot of desire to eat.  Time now is 23 o'clock and I'm ready to sleep at 24 o'clock.   What should I eat: 50 grams of Quinoa with chicken breast, or an egg with a lot of cottage cheese and some bread?  What would help me without stressing my digestive system, not gaining fat and get the highest of return of investment value?  My Workout Plan:   Lats Pulldown Chest Press Machine Deadlift Biceps/Triceps Superset Squat with Smith Machine Shoulder Press with Dumbbells   I also checked this question: What to eat after a late night workout? "
3338,"If you can't flexed-arm hang, are you necessarily cheating on your pull-ups?","I can do pull-ups in the 6-8 range, but I can't flexed-arm hang with my chin over the bar for more than a few seconds. Have I unwittingly been using momentum to get my chin to the bar without a full range of motion? Or might my anatomy make the flexed-arm hang difficult, with my top range of motion being slightly lower than my chin? "
3339,How can I best modify starting strength to fit with a team practice schedule and cardiovascular conditioning?,"I have two goals: improve speed and vertical, and improve at my sport (ultimate).  It seems from my relatively untrained state, the biggest gains in speed and vertical will come from strength training, so I plan to do power lifting, and the Starting Strength programming schedule looks like a good starting point.  But, I also want to improve at my sport and expect practices to happen twice a week, with occasional weekend tournaments. I also will need to develop my cardiovascular endurance. These additional goals seem to conflict with the basic Starting Strength programming schedule, so I suspect I'll need to sacrifice the fastest possible strength gains for a more well-rounded program.  I have two ideas:   Interleave lifting with practice and cardio  Dropping to 2 lifting days per week (vs the 3 prescribed in Starting Strength) Scheduling lifting days on non-practice days Adding a mid-length interval training run once per week on a non-running/non-lifting day  Add practice and cardio to my lifting days  Just making sure my lifting days happen on the same days as my practices... do lifting before practice On my third lifting day, do that mid-length interval training after the lifting.    Option 1 spaces things out more, but option 2 leaves days of full rest between exercise. Not sure what is more important.  What do you think? Does anyone have other ideas?  (Background: I'm 150 lbs, can only squat my body weight, 45 minute 10k.) "
3340,What is the difference between rest and sleep? Can inactivity replace sleep?,"I've just been reading about the importance of rest days and why sleep is important.  According to Lego Stormtroopr, sleep is something you can't work around.  I work at a desk in an office all day. Is this considered resting?  If I get less sleep one night, is it at least beneficial that I'm sedentary during the day? What effect does being at work have on my body? Are my muscles regenerating and, if so, would they be doing as much regenerating as if I were sleeping?  The sources I've read don't specifically say whether rest and sleep can or cannot be substituted or what the body is doing during each. "
3341,Recommended workout duration vs working out with a partner,"I've read about / been told / agree with the fact that my workout should not be exceeding around 1 hour, however most of my workouts approach the 90 mins - 2 hour mark because I work out with a partner.  When done solo, I can finish all of my workouts in under an hour 15.  What does the 1 hour recommendation actually cover? Is that one hour of total weightlifting time, one hour of weight lifting inclusive of the minimum rest between sets, or just one hour total regardless of time spent waiting for my partner to finish his sets, waiting for equipment to be vacant, etc?  If the final point is valid, does that mean that me and my friend should work out how to finish both of our workouts in under 75 minutes or so, maybe by using separate equipment?  My goal is maximum size / mass gains. "
3342,Preservatives in protein-shake powder?,"I purchased protein shake powder a few months ago. I've been storing it at room temperature in my kitchen, temporarily also in the fridge. Produced in 08/2010, expriation date 02/2012.  What kind of preservatives does this powder contain, and are they any way problematic?  Come on, there must be powerful preservatives inside this stuff,  because it has high nutritional value, has very low grain size, is very sweet and, thus, should be a really good breeding ground for microorganisms. But until now, nothing seems to have changed inside the plastic containers. The coconut taste sometime is a bit murky, but this can be by design or maybe the concentration was too high.  This question: Protein mix - How long can it sit? refers to the max duration a shake can be stored after water has been added and the shake is ready to drink (2 hours). I'm referring to the powder form here.  Edit - Ingredients: Calcium caseinate, milk protein concentrate, whey protein concentrate, protein enriched whey powder, Egg albumin, flavouring, glucose syrup, banana powder, Mg carbonate, Vegetable oil, sweeteners: Aspartame and acesulfame-k, vitamin c; niacin, Beta carotin, pantothenic acid, Vitamin B6, vitamin B1, riboflavine "
3343,is it true that weight loss for people who have been quite over-weight for a long time will only result in loose skin?,"I heard that people who have been over-weight for a while have 'permanently' stretched their skin, and for that reason weight loss will only result in loose skin (appearance wise).  Doesn't age have something to do with this (if your still young, it tightens up, right?)?  Can someone please set me straight about this.  Thanks "
3344,Should I continue with the same routine I had?,"Good day everyone!  Two months ago, I used to have good habits: I went to the gym and had my healthy eating plan. I had approximately one year exercising, which  I lost 33 pounds, but in that period of time in the last 3 months everything seemed to no longer work. My routine in the gym was ""Simple"", I focused more on performing Cadio: one hour to be specific. After cardio I focused on a part of my body for 30 minutes, for example:   Monday: leg. Tuesday: Chest. Wednesday: abdomen. Thursday: Arms. Friday: A bit of all of the above.   *3X20 in different exercises, with machines and weights.  On the contrary on weekends, I like to go out with my friends. I must admit that in our meetings There is always a lot of beer, which I like a lot. I think that drinking beer in considerable quantity was one of my impediments to get the results (keep losing fat) that I was looking for my body.  During these two months without physical activity, I have gained approximately 8 pounds, so for me it is unacceptable. Now I want to start over, but I don't know if I should go back to my old gym routine. I really want to focus on losing fat, I must lose approximately 22 pounds to be at my optimal weight.   Should I continue with the same routine I had? o Should I change something? Should I definitely stop drinking beer?  "
3345,Are 'dynamic' balance boards better for balance training than 'static' ones?,"I have a simple round balance board with contact point at the middle. I've tried vew-do, with rolling balance point, that moves along the rail on the bottom of the board. It was terribly hard, I've managed not to fail for about 2 seconds... Those things are also much more expensive...   But are they actually better for building balance (for trail running, climbing etc)  and training stabilization muscles? Or they are just for training balance with more fun and adrenaline? "

Recently I've being doing some longer runs up to half-marathon distance, and getting really sore calf muscles.    The odd thing is that it seems to be isolated to the soleus.  Any clues as to what might be the cause?  Seems to me like soreness in one very specific place would suggest an issue with form?  So what does the soleus do that the gastrocnemius doesn't (in running terms ideally)? "
3348,Is Zumba Fitness 2 (Wii) an accurate representation of Zumba?,"I just got Zumba Fitness 2 for the Nintendo Wii, and prior to receiving it I knew almost nothing about Zumba. I understand Zumba is a fitness routine based on Latin dance, but when playing the game I'm surprised at how simple some of the steps/routine are.   The game appears to have only 4 different ""steps"" for each dance style, and maybe 5-7 different dance styles. Most of the steps seem pretty uncomplicated. Things like taking one step back and then one step forward. Or facing left and then facing forward.  I understand the main point of Zumba is fitness and not dance, but I honestly expected something more complicated. So I'm wondering, are the simple steps in this game really all there is to Zumba routines? Or is this a sort of ""dumbed down"" version? In short, how accurate is the depiction of Zumba in Zumba Fitness 2? "
3349,How long warm-up before gripper training?,"How long should I warm-up to secure train with the grippers?  I'm asking not about general warm-up but about warm-up aimed specifically on hands. Should it be 5 minutes, or 1 minute intensive hands and fingers warm-up is enough?  I'm training with relative light grippers - 150 lbs, and I'm still not closing it. I've once had problem (about a year ago), when I've got 'clicking' finger', but I think it was because of missing finger-oriented warm-up.  "

3356,How can I learn essential self care?,"I know that it is impossible for anyone to give me a complete answer on how I can lead a healthy, productive life without writing a book, but what I wish to ask is how can someone who possesses no knowledge of meal preparation, exercise or any forms of self care learn to take care of herself?   I don't know anything at all about even the rudimentary aspects of this and this is having a severe impact on my life. From what I understand, I'm not the only person with this problem, and the degree to which a person is unhealthy seems to be correlated with gaps in their self care knowledge and abilities.  Can someone please help me to understand how I can start learning the skills I need to lead a healthy, productive life? "
3357,Muscle size reduction sans loss,"I'm in a rather weird situation here. I've been doing weights for about a year; it's been going well due to a good trainer (my brother), good attitude and suchlike. I've been able to keep going 4 days a week with very few hitches other than intense work periods such as examinations. I do my whole body, chest &amp; arms, legs, shoulders, back, over the week. For brevity purposes, I normally do about 8-10 reps of whatever exercise, and i have definitely gotten stronger - for instance, going from ~40kg to about 70kg on bench over the past few months. Tone has increased, pectorals now visible, adonis' belt, toned legs etc. It's going well... Or rather, has been up until recently.  The truth is that I've been having some gender issues for quite a while. They've been skulking in the background since a few years ago, but they've really snowballed this year (since around July 2013), even more so in the past couple of months. I started my weight training in September last year. It's helped considerably with my depression; I've always wanted to be able to train, but when i was younger i had massive psychological trouble doing it, and now it's easy for me. However, despite my growing desire to look like a girl, I've kept up the upper-body exercises which don't exactly help with that (I'm not terribly girly naturally), because:   I don't want to undo my hard work, even though I'm not sure if I want it any more... Strength is helpful (I do other sports like boxing and fencing), and even though it's not how i want to look now, it does look good on a guy, and I was definitely proud of it. I'm aware this is probably a good example of sunk cost fallacy, but still, it's interfering with my decision making. It's only been recently (i.e. within the past couple of months) that I've really felt a very strong dissatisfaction with my body. Last year, I wanted to feel girly, but I didn't mind my arms as much. I just liked dressing in girl's clothing and using makeup and things like that. I didn't really think about trying to pass as much as now, since I still very much thought of myself as a guy, and I wasn't sure if this was just a phase or if I was serious about this or whether I was going to be more serious about this in the future; I did plan on getting a corset so my waist would be narrower, but I didn't dare consider dropping my arm workout because I was already in a very good - but rigid - routine, and I felt it didn't affect my appearance that much anyway (compared to other things). However, now I keep looking at photographs of myself and getting upset at how my upper body looks; my arms look bulky, chest too large, it just doesn't look girly at all. And that's even before I think about my face, but that's another issue entirely. I'm also currently training with my brother (he wasn't here for most of the year, but he's back now), and I don't want to drop half my workout entirely in front of him; I wouldn't want him to feel disappointed or something.   This is starting to become really stressful for me, partially because it involves such a hard decision, as one can see above. As time goes on, any sort of transition will become harder, other things may come up, and in any case there will be more progress wasted if i do stop it (the upper body workout that is) entirely. I'd rather start making progress towards my preferred look as soon as possible, but it's deadlocked by this indecision.   However, further research has shown me that muscle strength without increasing bulk is possible (low reps, high weight). Personally I think this would be a good compromise for now; I wouldn't feel as if I'd lost progress if I kept up my strength, and I need my arms to be in good shape anyway (for boxing). I've asked around and apparently if i were to start going for entirely strength building - i.e. building muscle itself rather than sarcoplasm, which is what increases the size iirc - my exterior would simply cease to grow, rather than becoming smaller... Which is of course undesirable.  I should also point out that I will probably be going on hormonal treatment at some time in the future which will of course inhibit muscle growth (reducing testosterone), but I'm not sure what effect it'll have on current muscles.  Does my idea about reducing size while retaining some strength hold water? Are there any other ways of reducing size while keeping some progress? Am I going about this the complete wrong way? Do I need to just stop everything entirely? Am I just another victim of sunk cost fallacy? Please help, I am getting very stressed about this and I really don't know enough about the ins-and-outs of this to make a decision in a timeframe I'd like, especially since it's a rather quaint situation created by rapid change of circumstances.

3358,Back muscles training - swimming vs stand up paddling (SUP),"I'm looking for outdoor workout concentrated on back muscles. My current one (running, cycling) targets only legs and I don't have much to do in resting days...   I have a lake nearby so I'm thinking of SUP and swimming. Both are easily available to me (10 minutes to the beach with a bike, where I can both swim and SUP).   Are both activities similar wonderful for training back muscles? Or one of them would be better if I aim to train arms/back, and allows legs to rest between running training?  "

3360,Tracking open water breaststroke swimming distance,"I don't know if I'm moving in a marginal zone for smart watches...   My smart watch (Garmin Fenix) has an app for tracking open water swimming. However, I'm swimming breastroke with head-over-water. The arms are likely to be fully under water the whole time. In that setup, even if the hand is a few cm under the water surface, the GPS tracking doesn't work at all! I've learned to make my technique even more amateur by adapting hand movements so that they emerge in straightening phase. It is enough to keep the watch tracking my activity, but I observe strange zig-zags on the activity map, and the distance is a bit longer as I'd expect, so I don't get reliable tracking.  Is it a software problem (assuming everyone swims crawl) or a hardware barrier (you can't get GPS signal 1 cm under water)? Is there an alternative device for open water swimming tracking?  "
3361,How to eat healthy and maintain weight while travelling / being on vacation?,"My situation is I am really trying to get very fit and loose weight. When I am home, I am doing really well. I follow a pretty extreme diet, which basically has become a lifestyle. All is well, and that works really well, and I can maintain the weight I want.  Now, problem is I travel a lot. This year it is more than 2.5 months, distributed over multiple times a year. And you can do a lot of damage in 3-4 days (trust me, I am an expert).  When I travel I will consistently eat unhealthy. Extremely unhealthy. Yes, we are talking donuts, sandwiches, ice cream, burgers, pasta and even orange juice!  The problem arises in the following ways:   I find it extremely difficult to find low-carb / slow-carb food in most cities (sitting in New York airport right now - one **** of a sandwich town!) I find it extremely difficult to eat healthy in airports, especially because I hate being hungry. This is also a problem when travelling 16-20 hours+ I enjoy the plane food quite a lot The second I enter a plane, my brain suddenly goes: ahh, you are away from home, let's go buy a donut! make it two! Conferences and similar: breakfast buffet full of bread, danishes and cake.. simply to tempting   This is both a problem when visiting a city for some days for a conference, but also when I am sitting 3 weeks on a beach in the Philippines.  I know this is a difficult question, but:   Is there any best practice, on how to maintain a healthy diet and even loose weight on a vacation? Any best practice to stop the brain from thinking ""Yay, vacation!"", every time I enter an airplane?  "
3362,"Will increasing your daily calorie more than the required limit, solely by protein drinks help in putting on weight","So I read in many places online that the way to put on weight is to increase the daily calorie intake to more than the body requires so that it does not burn through the fat reserve.   My question is: can this calorie intake be achieved by increasing protein shakes? I do not mean to NOT eat any solid food at all. However considering a situation where healthy solid food is not as readily available, can supplementing more protein shakes do the trick?  I know its not a long term healthy or viable solution. I am just curious to know if shakes and powders alone can do the trick of gaining weight. "
3363,How much fat I can safely lose?,"I'm 25 years old (soon will be 26), height 174cm and weight is 77KGs. After reading some questions here I realized that in order to achieve my dream body shape (link) I need to lose as much fat as I can. My questions are:   1- How much fat I should lose?  2- It seems there is a difference between fat and weight, so how can I measure how much fat I have now?! "
3364,Muscles shake irregularly during workout?,I've been working out for a while now and I realized that my muscles shake whenever I lift weight.  It doesn't seem like it's because of the weight.  I could halve the weight on a bench press bar and I would still shake.  I still always get through the work out but the shaking is always there.  What could be an explanation of this?  Is it a low blood sugar problem as a result of not eating enough?    Thanks. 
3365,Impossible to naturally build muscle steadily without gaining fat?,"I know there are other questions around that are similar to this one, but read on and see that mine has more concerns regarding muscle building vs. fat building.  It's a common thing in bodybuilding: bulking and cutting. The mantra behind bulking is that one ""must accept the fat gains in order to gain muscle."" The idea behind this is cut and dry: it's generally believed in bodybuilding circles that one has to gain fat in order to gain muscle, and that there's no easy way around it (aside from steroids and other alternatives that need not be discussed here).  So if one is to believed to have to get fatter in order to get more muscular, how does one steadily and efficiently gain muscle while not gaining fat? The problem with the formula is this:  1.Calorie surplus needed to gain muscle.  2.Calorie surplus adds fat.  3.Ergo, gaining muscle means gaining fat is guaranteed.  The same formula works backwards and is not sexy either:  1.Calorie deficit needed to lose fat.  2.Calorie deficit means muscle loss.  3.Ergo, losing fat means losing muscle is guaranteed.  If we go by calories in-vs.-out and a basic understanding of the human body's thermodynamics, how can one accurately design a program surrounded by building muscle constantly (anabolic) and losing fat (catabolic), when all the knowledge we have and programs we tend to follow preach that:  1.Building muscle and losing fat is impossible.  2.You can't build muscle without building fat.  3.You can't lose fat without losing muscle.  Therein lies the born notion of bulking and cutting. Is this fact or is there more to the story here? If this is all true, then everyone who wants to build some muscle must get fatter too?   Isn't that a contradiction for athletes?   You can imagine that it'd make no sense for an athlete to be shoveling down a surplus and slowly getting fatter if the goal to be an athlete is generally remaining lean and built, engaging muscle building, endurance and power + speed.   I'm now trying to find the holy-grail: do both at the same time, or as simultaneously as possible.   I'm trying to do ""my own thing,"" but I fear that it doesn't really work too well and it seems nearly impossible for me to keep revealing my six-pack through fat loss, while assuring I'm building the most muscle I possibly can.  Regardless of the answers given, I won't ""stop"" trying to achieve my goals whether they're unrealistic or not. I'd rather die trying to reach the holy-grail than live in an uncomfortable burden of bitter taste. "
3366,Adding Whey Protein to fitness goal,"Some background - Its been around 8 months since I have been exercising regularly, I am 178 cm tall, used to weigh 52.4 Kg when I had started, I have increased to 57.8 till date. Though I was advised about whey protein all along in the beginning I ignored it thinking it was a supplement, it affects kidneys, I can consume that much protein in chicken and fish etc.  Now at this point, I think the gains have not been as much as I had anticipated, mainly because of not reaching the daily protein intake on some days as I don't eat meat daily.  So is it a good idea to consider taking whey protein? How much, which brand? Or just keep on going as it is and reach my goal of 64? Also, once I decide to stop taking it, will it affect my weight?  "
3367,Can weighted Pushups replace Benchpress?,"I've been training my upper body using only body-weight for a long time now, and I recently started using a weighted backpack with nice tight straps (~+30% of my body-weight) directly over my center of mass. Then a personal trainer told me, it is much healthier to do Bench Presses instead, because they are an ""Open Kinetic Chain Exercise"" and thus put less stress on the joints. So two things:  1. Is he right?  2. If not, Are there any other reasons I would want to do bench presses instead? "
3368,Supplementary exercises to sprints,"What are supplementary exercises one can do to increase sprinting speed? I've been working on my core and hip flexors so I can pull up my legs faster as well as squatting to push harder. It seems like the squats are not so helpful since they use the hamstring and require you to push from your heels, whereas in a sprint you're almost never on your heels. Basically, I've noticed that the weight on the squat bar has almost no correlation to my sprinting speed. Are there any replacements that people use to increase sprinting speed beyond those I've mentioned? "
3369,abs at home workouts-diet,"I have watched a lot of videos on YouTube and have searched on Google but I am disappointed because my abs aren't as defined as I think they should be. My food intake is good, I have cut out sugar and am not eating anything that contains sugar.   My questions are:   Should I eat a lot of fruits and vegetables too for abs?  What workouts will be the most effective for my abs?   I don't have the money to go to a gym so I can only train at home.  What workouts will give me obvious results, because I have worked a lot on my abs. I know food is playing an important role but I think my abs routine isn't good. I train abs everyday only in the morning.  I hope to give me good information, I am not a professional and may do somethings wrong.  Thanks "
3370,"Should I have run faster during the race, or was I just more motivated than the others","Last Friday I did my first running race: 6.2km I ran 35.58min (35.10 netto time), which is my personal best.  What I found rather strange is, that although I was already running faster than I ever did before on that distance, I was able to speed up a little for the last 800m or so, and even getting seriously fast (by my standards) on the last 200m. Therefore I was able to overtake many other runners, who weren't willing or weren't able to speed up at the end.  I'm wondering: Should I have run a little faster during the complete race thus reaching an even better total time?   Or was everybody else just taking it easy, not bother to sprint in the end?   Or did I just hit it perfect and most others were just going to fast during the race and couldn't speed up in at the end anymore?  Let's rephrase it to make it independent from my personal race:  In order to achieve the best possible time should we   a) run at a speed that allows us to just barely finish at almost constant speed?  or   b) run slightly slower and sprint at the end toward the finish and total exhaustion? "
3371,Pressups on fingers to get bigger wrists - am I doing more harm than good? What precautions to take?,"Though I do moderate weightlifting, bar pullups, monkey bars and things, my wrists are quite small (more like a lady's!) and so I want to build them up to be thicker (I would imagine this is a weak point for arm exercises e.g. I could have a big bicep and curl a heavy weight, but if my wrist is small I could injure it easily). Anyway looking at questions on here people have suggested pressups on all five fingers, which I am beginning to do. My concern is of course that my fingers are not be used to this.  Am I going to do more harm than good by doing pressups this way, like give myself arthritis? What precautions should I take?  Thanks for any advice. If anybody can recommend other wrist exercises that might be more beneficial, that would be great.  EDIT: Would it be better to do the pressups on my knuckles i.e. with a closed fist? "
3372,Effectiveness of Abdominal Vacuum,"How effective is the Abdominal Vacuum? I like the exercise because I can do it anywhere, sitting on a chair, walking, sitting in bus, but I don't feel any pain like I do in other muscles after exercise, so I am skeptical if it has any benefit at all. Does anyone get any gain from this?  Why does this exercise not cause pain? "
3373,Fat burning exercises meaningful only three times a week?,"I use an elliptical cross trainer for fat burning exercises. Normally, they recommend to exercise three times a week. given I could exercise daily, what is a meaningful optimal training plan? (my current BMI is 32, and it used to be 26.5 a couple of years ago).  Why is this question not for opinion based answers?   Can i.e. is known - facts -  daily elliptical training cause negative health effects e.g. on the knees?  "
3374,What is the best way of getting into open water swimming?,I am considering training for a triathlon and wondered what the best approach is when starting out with open water swimming?   Also would you recommend buying a wetsuit straight away?  Does it tend to be a lot harder when swimming outdoors?  Thank you in advance! 
3375,Name exercise for abs in the dip bars,How do you call an exercise that consists in holding the dip bars with the arms straight (during the whole exercise) and contracting the abs? What is it good for?  
3376,Squatting with bruised knee,"So these past couple weekends, a couple and friends and I have gotten together and played soccer. Somehow, I always manage to run into someone, and injuring (bruising?) my knee. The inside of my knee is tender, and I feel it when at the bottom of bodyweight squats. Last time this happened, I just skipped squats completely for the next workout or two, then it seemed to be fine. However, I don't really want to hinder my squat progress too much, so I was wondering if it is still okay to squat with a bruised knee (at a lighter weight). I am deloading from 140 to around 95, as per suggestion of a form check I posted, to make sure I fix my major buttwink.   So real question, skip squats due to minor knee bruising? Or will I be fine, especially since I am deloading 30% to work on form?  (the program I am following is Ice Cream Fitness at the moment, in case it may be of use) "
3377,Workouts to Strengthen the Rib Cage,"A few years ago I used to do Brazilian Jiu-jitsu. During a competitive roll, I popped a rib out of place when my opponent put his knee (and full weight) on my side. That injury took me out for three months since any time I would do a sit-up type of motion I'd have pain. I never ended up going back but I would like to.  Lately, I've been doing lots of strength training. I'm wondering what type of workout could I incorporate into my current training to prevent that type of injury again. Is it as simple as strengthening the abdominal muscles? The ribs are higher than your abs so is there a way to strengthen your rib cage? "
3378,Drowning in the sea when swimming,"Drowning in the sea is a common phenomenon in Summer. I have heard a lot of things about why it may happen, and I have searched on the Internet, but I've found a lot of different answers. I will ask a couple of questions because all are relative to how the body acts in those situations. I have seen people drowning and I would like help on this topic. We sometimes talk about one plate meal, at least I think this is the harmful thing. I don't even know if most swimmers are victims of that of those I know who have been drowning.   If someone eats, and immediately enters the sea (not swimming, but his whole body is in the water), is he in danger of drowning, or to die by other reason like a heart attack? If someone eats and he/she goes immediately for a swim, is he in danger of drowning? How can we prevent drowning if we want to go for swim? How much time should we wait to get in? (Optional) Is there something we can do if we get in and we forgot we had already eaten?  "
3379,Chest bench press using a machine,"I have been working out for 1.5 years now.  For chest bench press(with a barbell), I do  10(rep)x30(kg) 10(rep)x40(kg) 8(rep)x50(kg)   I feel quite a pain in my front delts while doing and for 2 days after.  In contrast, if I do the it with a chest machine as shown in the picture, I can lift more weight also (can go around 70-80 kg for 3rd set) and I don't feel any pain(soreness) in delts later.  So, can I continue doing it with machine itself?  What's wrong with my barbell bench press?   "
3380,How much running is advisable for over weight person?,"I am 5 feet 11 inches tall and weigh about 95 kilograms. Is it advisable to jog/run for 20 minutes a day? Do i risk injuring my knees? The idea behind runnning is to loose weight and gain a lot of endurance and stamina.  I have been doing squats and lunges to strengthen my leg muscles.  EDIT: I would like to ask the similar question about skipping/jump ropes. Would jumping for about 2 minutes every day (about 100 jumps) cause serious longterm injuries? I find jumping ropes very enjoyable exercise, but I sometimes get dull ache (stiffness) just above the knees and hence the question "
3381,Why does cardio/aerobic exercise lead to muscle loss?,"Recently, I've been reading a lot about how cardio reduces muscle mass and strength.   The following is an excerpt from crossfit.com that seems to sum up what I've been reading:     Aerobic training beneﬁts cardiovascular function and decreases body fat – all good. Aerobic conditioning allows us to engage in low power extended efforts efﬁciently (cardio/respiratory endurance and stamina). This is critical to many sports. Athletes engaged in sports or training where a preponderance of the training load is spent in aerobic efforts witness decreases in muscle mass, strength, speed, and power. It is not uncommon to ﬁnd marathoners with a vertical leap of only several inches! Furthermore, aerobic activity has a pronounced tendency to decrease anaerobic capacity. This does not bode well for most athletes or those interested in elite ﬁtness.   I've also seen some dramatic pictures(if unflattering to endurance runners) that emphasize this:.  So here is my question. Why is there a decrease in muscle mass etc. with aerobic, but not with anaerobic activities? Is cross training enough to offset this? Or should everyone give up on long distance running and other endurance sports if they want muscles, more power, etc.? Is there any benefit to endurance sports other than better cardiovascular function when compared to strength training (if this in fact the case)? "
3382,How much should I worry about eating more when exercising?,"It's been a long time since I last spent any serious time working out. And the skinny and fit kid I used to be is now a lightly overweight and unfit man. I weigh 12st (at 5' 7'') and have had to buy new clothes recently because my old ones don't fit any more :(  I finally started again, and I'm doing quite a bit (four equimentless workouts a week, 2 strength, 2 HIIT, cycling half an hour twice a day, and working my way through a 50 push ups challenge)  I'm suddenly finding myself hungry all the time. I'm not eating ""bad"" food, as far as I know; I've been having nuts and bananas and lots of water, so I think this is natural.  What I would like to know is:   Should I try and avoid eating sometimes? (Keep in mind I'm looking to loose quite a bit of weight) Should I restrict what I eat? Will this go away or should I get used to it?   UPDATE Following comments regarding overtraining, I thought it best to mention that my excercises had at first left me sore and stiff but that has now gone. I'm working hard but I don't feel (physically) like I'm overdoing it.  I'm doing Neila Rey's 50 push up challenge and I'm definitely making progress (plus my shirt collar doesn't do up any more :( ) Progress is good, my concern is in telling the difference between hungry because I need to eat and hungry because my body doesn’t want to use up its fat cells. "
3383,Is it effective to do 2 sets for size and 2 sets for strength?,"I've read a lot about size gains vs strength gains, where the difference is substantial and where size is certainly not linear to strength.   Strength appears to come from low reps with very heavy weight. Size moreso from high repetitions.   Lately I've been trying out 2 sets for size and 2 sets for strength. So for example for barbell curls I might do this:   8-10 reps of 8kg. 8-10 reps of 10kg. 4-6 reps of 16kg. 4 reps of as heavy as I can (failing on the 4th).   Is this type of training effective, or should I just stick to one thing at a time (like weekly rotation between strength vs size)?  I seem to be breaking past a lot of plateaus in terms of the weight I was able to lift, but I am starting to think I may have slowed my size gains down.     With a goal of mass gain specifically, would this approach put on more size through being able to lift heavier weights in the high rep range? I found it hard to add extra weight each session sticking to 3-4 sets of 8-10. Then again I'm not sure if the much slower progression of weight I am able to lift while sticking to 4 full sets of high repetitions will actually benefit me more over time.  "
3384,ReFirm - Shrinking Fat Cells,"There is a product called ReFirm by Complete Nutrition.  I cannot find it on their website, but the commercials on the radio claim that this stuff works by ""shrinking your fat cells.""  I know in nutrition, Fat grams have about 8 calories whereas Protein and Carbohydrates each run roughly 4 calories per gram.  So, if a Fat Cell stored in the body were to shrink, does that Fat Cell still have the same properties as a Fat Cell that has not been shrunk?  What has changed? Was water removed?  The commercial continues on to say that you can lose inches and fit into those clothes you no longer fit in.  I'm thinking all of the fat is still there and the person weighs about the same - their Fat Cells are just smaller. Now they are, what, more dense?  When the ReFirm program has ended, do these smaller Fat Cells regain their regular size the next time you have a glass of water? "
3385,Breaking down on Starting Strength,So my favorite Training Program let me down or should I say I fail to raise myself to it's level :-(  Last 2 months have been difficult on SS. First I wanted to lose weight and then travelling and erratic food habits + sickness and injuries didn't let me make any progress. I have hardly increased on any of the lifts. My Program includes SS + Barbell rows(120 pounds) currently apart from overhead press all my lifts are close to 220 pounds which is 10-15 pounds more than 2 months ago but I am plagued with injuries. I weigh 195 pounds. I have frequent back aches out of which one is a persistent one in the Rhomboids. Rotating on my back causes pain in the middle back. However bending and lifting weights isn't that much of a problem. It also seems that my recovery isn't as good may be because of the food.  What kind of break I can take to heal the back while still retaining strength ?  What would be the best way to come back on the program ? 
3386,is eating 6 times instead of 3 times will help reduce belly fat?,some suggest cut 3 times food and eat same amount 6 times....  still total calorie that body take is same right ?  than how its going to reduce belly fat ?  or skipping morning breakfast will help us to reduce belly fat ? than we will face gastric Problems right ?  
3387,How to choose a treadmill for a Walking Desk aka Treadmill Desk,"These might be the characteristics of a decent treadmill for running:   powerful motor max speed. The more, the better. hydraulic incline adjustment weight of the device. 70kg unit will be, on average, more durable than 30kg flimsy toy. price. In general, the higher the MSRP, the better the unit user reviews   Initially, I wanted to browse my local 'Craigslist' and pick a treadmill for a Walking Desk by applying above evaluation scheme.    However, I came across an article on workwhilewalking.com, which states that all those parameters are irrelevant, or even misleading. The reason being, treadmill-base of a Walking Desk is used…:   …for walking:     When running, you’re kicking the belt backwards and are in the air   part of the time. When you’re walking at 1-2 mph, the belt is pushing   your entire body weight while overcoming friction between the belt and   the deck.  …at low speeds:     Any motor specifications other than the torque of the motor when running at speeds of 1-2 mph is utterly irrelevant.   […]   When walking at 1-2 mph, the motor will only produce a fraction of its rated horsepower. […]   When you need the most horses to pull the belt along, the motor delivers the fewest.  …for much longer periods of time than, say, running 5x1h / week   All these combined lead to overheating and premature death of, allegedly, any treadmill that was not designed specifically for walking:     We’ve seen 2.5 HP motors used in high-end running treadmills burn out every few months under the strain of daily walking at 1-2 mph for hours at a time.   In the article, instead of grabbing a sweet second-hand deal on Craigslist, they advise either:   Splurging on a walking-dedicated treadmill.   or:   Finding a rehab-dedicated treadmill:     We’ve seen 1.5 HP motors in low-cost treadmills originally designed for rehab applications (typically topping out at 4 mph) last forever with constant use in a treadmill desk application.    or:   Buying an inexpensive running-dedicated (aka 'regular') treadmill with a long warranty period on the motor. One'll have couple of warranty replacements, and, after the warranty period is expired, one will buy another unit.   I don't like approaches 1. and 2. above, because of a) limited availability of those high-end units in my country b) their insane price as for a treadmill with no incline, no heart rate sensors, etc. - I feel like I'm overpaying.  What do you think?     Perhaps there are some other ways to tell if a running treadmill will be suitable for walking ?  While the arguments in the article sound really wise, I've seen positive feedback on regular treadmills coming from users, that used them exclusively for walking. Maybe I should look for a different type of treadmill? Magnetic, Manual ?  "
3388,Is really sugars present in fruits will increase belly fat?,"As we all know sugar will increase belly fat, but what about sugar which present in fruits ?  so is we need to avoid fruits like mango, banana to reduce belly fat ?  If so what fruits i need to take and what i need to avoid ? "
3389,Squatting is causing pain in my quadriceps,"This is not a medical/health question; this is a question on why doing squats is causing me a burning/painful sensation in my quadriceps. I normally work my legs using squats only for now ... I just did a few reps yesterday with a 50 lb. barbell on my shoulders, full depth, and my quadriceps have a burning, swollen feel ... but this probably has always been. If I do more than, like, 5 reps in a single set I get tremendous pain in the muscles, usually D.O.M.S. If I do low reps it's fine, and I only care for strength and nothing else as part of my workout.   Why would my muscles be getting a swollen, burning like sensation? I have been doing squats for many years (6) and this problem always endues; also similar with other major muscle groups.  Could there be a good reason why something I've been doing years and have experience with (good form as well, etc.) be causing me displeasure from throwing in a few more reps here and there? I mean I walk a lot, but that's a necessity. Most leg work I get is walking.  "
3390,why fat will store only in belly region,"when we overeat, fat should store equally in every parts of the body  why it will store only in belly region for some persons ?  for some persons, if they eat more with no workouts also they look slim  for some persons, if they eat less , than also they look fat ?  Is it all depends on individuals ? "
3391,is there any food for weight loss,"I heard if we drink 4 cups of green tea daily, than we can reduce belly fat  Is green tea will burn the calories ?   if so is there any other solid or liquid foods like this ?  or is all low calories foods will help to reduce belly fat ? "
3392,Do crunches actually increase belly size?,"Crunches is the go-to exercise for people wishing to reduce the belly. But wouldn't training the belly muscles actually increase the belly size? Given the fact that fat spot reduction is a myth, wouldn't we end with more mass by performing crunches (or similar exercises)? "
3393,Is my mass gainer supplement ideal?,"Let me describe myself:  I have been weightlifting since I graduated (2010). Before graduation I weighed close to 120lbs, now I weigh (on a good day) 163lbs (I'm 5' 11""). I have plenty of definition but want to build mass. I have done a lot of research for different routines and everything that has to do with body building.   Body fat %: 8.8  My Diet: I'm happy with my diet. It consists of high protein (chicken) and healthy carbs (whole wheat bread, fruits, oatmeal). Not Much fat though. (Usually several servings of peanut butter a day) On Saturdays, I eat anything I want.  My Ultimate Goal: Body Building - I get compliments all of the time, but I'm still ""too skinny"" (for my own standards). I want to gain probably 10 more healthy pounds.   My Routine:  Right now I have a 6 day routine and substitute the cardio and abs for high intensity kick-boxing classes. I usually switch up my workout routines every 3 months or so. So I am fairly satisfied with that.   Bench Press Max: 225lbs (~145% of my body weight) Deadlift Max: 255 Squat Max: 235 lbs (I know this needs to be increased, I've been focusing more on legs recently)   My Main Question: - GNC Mass XXX  Right now, I'm taking GNC's Mass XXX. I only take a little over half a serving (about 30g of protein) because I know my body does not process the full 50g)   Is it worth it? Is there an alternate suggested supplement? (Really any weight gaining supplements) Should I not be taking anything at all and do something different?   So to sum myself up - I'm pretty experienced with weightlifting and dieting, and ultimately I'm satisfied with where I'm at. Why not get stronger and bigger though? With my low body fat percentage and intense workouts, what should I do to gain strength and weight? I have been at a plateau for almost 6 months with only seeing gains in my abdominal area and legs.  "
3394,Is it good to use a steam room after working out?,"I have a habit of using a steam room (moist heat) after I work out at the gym. I do this weekly.   Is this helpful for recovery? Should I use the steam room immediately after my workouts, or should I wait? "
3395,Am I exercising all my muscles?,"I mainly perform following exercises: running (1-3 miles), push-ups, pull-ups, squats, sit-ups, calves raises, planks, legs raising, and bridges.  I vary them a little. For example, one day I do chin-ups instead of pull-ups, lateral planks, or lateral legs raisings, however, I never use weights.  Should I include anything else? (not considering things like stretching or walking, which I also do).  Add-on: I am the OP (who created an account now). Thank you, Doc, Renny and Dave for the feedback.   I can't use a barbell, but I could use a heavy backpack to increment my bodyweight.   Changing these points below, would my routine be complete?   Squats, enhanced with backpack (to cover for deadlifts). Vertical push-ups (to cover for barbell military press). Horizontal pull-up (to cover for barbell bent over row). Plus, adding dips and back extensions.   I could also enhance any exercise with the backpack or vary them (like doing push-ups on the tips of the fingers). The idea is still the same, be complete and simple, so I'll do it systematically.  "
3396,going to gym and workout with thin or fat body - which is better?,"Basically My hands and shoulders looks thin and I have lot more belly fat.

3397,burpees for weight loss,"I do 200 burpees every day. 20 sets of 10, with 15 sec rest between sets. I am not losing any weight. Is it possible that I'm doing them wrong? Would doing them more precisely be more effective? I also do 40 minutes of cardio on my elliptical every day. I keep my calories under 1300/day and I am following a low carb diet. I have lost 55 pounds, with about 45 to reach my goal. I have hit a plateau and keep gaining/losing the same 5 pounds.  "
3398,"Does fat actually ""harden"" or is there something else going on?","I read about subcutaneous and visceral fat and I understand it's the latter that is hard (and therefore cannot really be perceived by a person by touching and feeling around on the skin I assume).  But my question stems from my perception that my belly fat has been very apparently ""hardening"" over the past few weeks. I don't know if it's the fat actually hardening or some other phenomenon, but I wanted to know if subcutaneous fat ACTUALLY hardens?   I read in some places that perhaps the fat is ""settling"" and therefore hardening after LOONG periods of no exercise and therefore no circulation. Is there any scientific weight to that theory or is it just voodoo myth like most things on the internet?  If that's a myth then what is the explanation for my belly hardening recently?  Thanks for the info. "
3399,Exhaling properly underwater?,"The thing I struggle most with when trying to lap swim is getting the breathing right. After blowing my air out underwater, the breath I take in above water feels very shallow and I don't get much actual air out of it. After two or three inhales, I usually have to stop swimming and catch my breath.   How do I make sure I'm exhaling properly underwater? What is it I might be doing wrong? "
3400,Ways to motivate employers for exercise time?,"We have more than 700 personnel in our human resources department that sit several hours per day. When we alert them for exercise twenty percent stand up for this.  We worry about this and are thinking about ways to solve this problem. How can we motivate them to take part in the activities?  Can you help us and give your experiences to motivate yourself that if we generalize them, our personnel is notwithstanding? "
3401,"Wendler's routine, should I adjust? (KG)","I am doing Wendler's routine, and am still in my first mesocycle.  I hadn't progressed on other routines for six months, doing them properly, such as Stronglifts, mad cow, greyskull and a few others, I am clearly progressing now, but I feel like my set that is meant to be my one rep max being done for 15 reps is ridiculous. Especially considering I am meant to do another of these one rep max things in ~26 days at only 5 kg heavier than what I can already do for 15 reps.     TL:DR: I am doing really well on Wendler, should I increase the weights even though it is my first cycle?   Attached is my current progress(In KG):    Note, the final set in Wendler is as many reps as possible, the number of reps achieved is in blue for each workout.  As you can see, I am gaining reps on the final set while increasing the weight, which means it is likely too easy for me(?), and am thus unsure what to do. Following the routine properly I would be doing 120kg as my 1 rep max on Mon 14th of July, which is only 5kg heavier than I did 15 reps for in one set yesterday(16th of June). I feel like I could easily do 13ish reps for 120 already.  What do I do? Apparently I should not change his routine until the fourth cycle atleast, but this seems like a bad idea.  Note 2: I am following every aspect of the conventional routine, including 3x5 LS AMRAP, 3x3 LS AMRAP, 1x5 1x3 1x1 LS AMRAP.  Sorry for long post. "
3402,Improve my running,"I'm 31 and I started to run since December 2016. Currently I've 8 months running without any training plan, my schedule is this:   Run 3 or 4 time per week, leaving one day to rest between running day. Do intervals, mixing 500 mts running 80%, rest 15 seconds. Running on hills (Only 1 km)   Ok, I think my training is not ok, because when I rest more than one day, when I back to run I feel tired. Also for me is imposible to run more than 4km without walk to rest.  My Question is, How can I organize my training?? Any play for?? Should I increase my running days??? "
3403,The effects of blood/plasma donation on exercise performance and body composition,"A blood plasma donation center is opening up close to where I live soon and I was curious as to what sort of side effects I might experience by donating with regards to my exercise performance and body composition.  Lowered iron and oxygen levels because of lost blood will no doubt effect exercise performance, but in what way and to what extent? Likewise, the body will obviously lose weight in whatever amount of blood was lost, but during the period in which the body tries to restore that lost blood more energy would no doubt be expended right? Assuming that this temporary energy expenditure is significant enough to warrant consideration, what sort of range might be expected and for how long? "
3404,Will frequent training on a boxing bag have the same inhibiting effects for mass gaining as lots of running?,"I love using a boxing bag. Before I got serious about hitting the gym and putting on size, I used my bag up to two times per day for 30-60 minutes each session. I was very strong even without lifting any weights at all, and had very defined arms, traps, back and core. With that said, I would not consider any of those muscles as being anything close to 'big' at the time.  When I began weight training to gain size, I read a lot about the impact of cardio when trying to put on size. Because of this, I stopped using my bag altogether.  I have noticed that since then (about 5-6 months ago) my stamina and overall fitness has degraded severely. My strength and size however have of course skyrocketed.  I want to start using a bag again, but I am concerned about reducing my gains. I am not sure whether the boxing bag will restrict my gains to the same degree as say cycling or running, but I am much more interested in size gains than my fitness at this stage. I have compared running to boxing and to me it seems like if anything it may even assist with size gains, because of all the muscle groups used. I do still consider boxing as cardio though, which is why I've stopped doing it.  How will my gains be affected if I start using a boxing bag frequently? Will how I use the bag impact on the results? For example, can I hit much harder and less frequently to reduce the impact on my gains vs a more agile and fast-paced heavy bag workout? "
3405,Does my breast size decrease permanently after weight loss?,"I have been running for a while now and dieting, and I've lost a couple of pounds of weight. I'm now 130 lbs and 5 foot 11, and 25 years old. As a result, my breast size has also decreased.  I've heard that you lose more of your breast fat if you're on a calorie deficit, than what you gain if you're on a calorie surplus.  In other words, I've heard that if you lose 5 pounds, and then gain 5 pounds, you will have relatively less fat in your breasts in the end than before you lost the 5 pounds, and relatively more in your belly.  Is this true? is there scientific evidence for this, or for it being false? "
3406,Making a training plan for medieval swordsmen / reenactment,"Some of my friends are into history reenactment and historical fencing. Doing this is quite demanding in terms of fitness, so I wanted to help them develop a training plan to follow.  What would be the goals of such a training plan?   It has to strengthen stabilizing muscles of all the important joints. People doing this are fighting having really heavy armour. The helm itself can weigh up to 2kg, the mail can weigh up to 12kg. Add the gambeson and plates and you end up with around 20-30kg. To avoid injuries, strengthening the stabilizing muscles is a must. Some swordsmen say that a big focus should be put on scapla and lumbar stability. Anaerobic capacity. Some fights can last longer, especially 5v5 or 21v21, but typical tournament 1v1 fights have rounds lasting 1 minute of really intensive activity. A single handed sword might weigh around 1,2kg, two handed ones even more. The swordsmen must have superb control over their blades at all times - this is also a matter of safety. No not-intended thrusts! Strength. The outcome of a fight is often decided by a knock out. Even tho the swords are blunt and the fighters wear a lot of padding and armour, strong blows make people fall to the ground. Even if the fight wont be won by knockout, strong blows are like to break the parry or wear down the enemy. Time. A training plan must incorporate time for working on technique, without ruining the resting periods. That would probably mean that the technical training should happen on training days. Technical training often includes fencing drills (not necessairly in full armour) and sparrings, both can be quite demanding in their own right. Preferably, minimal use of fitness gear/equipment. Since the technical training should happen on the same days as the fitness one, it would be preferable that the strength training etc could do without a fully equipped gym. Its not crucial, as every swordsman could do the training alone, and group trainings would only cover the technical part.   I was wondering if a typical StartingStrength/5x5 training or similar, followed by HIIT sessions with a sword and a tire hung on a tree (resembling boxingbag workouts) would be the way to go. If that were the case, should the technical training take place before or after the fitness one? Are there any training plans that would better fufill the goals i mentioned earlier? Are there any bodyweight training programs that would do as good, but without the need of a gym/barbells?  Since every swordsman fights both in ""bohurts"" (many vs many) and 1v1 tournaments, a training plan accounting for both would be welcome. I know that you cant eat a cookie and have a cookie, so if Id have to point out the more important thing, it would be 1v1  here are a few videos to give you an idea of what they are doing:  [website][website][website][website]the last one is a Polish documentary about the Grunwald reenactment held each year in Poland. Ive set the timer to some fighting scenes that ended with a knockout - for those who have shown interest in the comments.    UPDATE Ive been talking with some friends and researching materials provided by the ARMA organisation. It may be very helpful in developing a training plan, and Im discovering new concepts. Cant jump to conclusions, but im starting to think that Starting Strength and similar programs may not be the best way to go...  Anyhow, one of the swordsmen pointed out that speed can be a crucial factor and definitely should be considered. he pointed out that most probably the program should be similar in some ways to existing conditioning programs designed for martial arts, only accomodating for the usage of heavy armour and weapons. "
3407,"Wendlers(5/3/1), how is each future mesocycles weight calculated?","At the end of each mesocycle, how does one calculate next cycles weights? Do I test my one rep max at the end of each cycle? It seems that you are meant to test your one rep max at the start of the program, and progress only 10kg per month for the rest of the year, or at least that is how the spreadsheet that was made for it is configured, but that doesn't seem to take into account doing better or worse than expected.  Any advice would be greatly appreciated. "
3408,If I lift on the moon will I get stronger?,"Say I lift on earth I will obviously build muscles, but what if I were to lift on the moon? Since objects are lighter on the moon I would be able to lift more weight thus I would get stronger faster? Right? "
3409,Can't get big arms in a sparing calorie deficit?,"I don't count calories, but know I'm getting leaner on my current diet and it's 100% fat loss. I am having trouble building biceps size however. I have worked my biceps for a long time and they do not get bigger. My triceps grow easily even on a big calorie deficit, and so do quads -- but bis seem to stay 13-14 inches for years with this kind of diet. Do biceps specifically need higher calorie diets to gain more muscle on that region? Because otherwise how do you explain the fact that I can build muscle in other regions with a deficit running and not on the biceps?  My traps have grown tremendously naturally while still cutting over months. I have been training for 3-4 years max. Why don't biceps grow on a deficit? They look leaner and get a ""pump"" which makes them bigger, but in a few days they shrink again a bit. I am not losing muscle, but none will be added to them. What can I do to force direct biceps brachili growth on a calorie deficit?  I've tried huge dropsets, tons of reps/sets, heavy weights, etc. My macros are well, but I don't eat too many carbs overall. I usually either float somewhere below and above calorie maintenance. I don't measure calories anymore, but I'm still gaining in other regions -- just not the biceps. They have been stuck at 13-14 inches for a good 2 or so years of steady training. I'm fairly lean and have very small bone frame. I have like 13% bodyfat give or take. What gives? I don't want no fatceps! "
3410,Improve diet to improve bone/joint structure?,"Weight: 80kg / 176 pounds Height: ~192cm / 6 foot 4 Age: 19  I am trying to improve my bone/joint structure and am worried that due to an insufficient diet, it's an uphill jog. I am asking for advice on improving my diet.  I became athletic at the age of 15, and haven't let myself go since. I have done martial-arts, swimming and rugby. For the past two years, I've been mostly working out on my own, doing resistance training, trying to improve antagonist muscle balance, some interval running and cardio. Overall, I prioritize ligament strength and joint stability/safety over muscle strength (if that makes sense) and body weight.  On to my diet: mostly (80%+) carbs in the form of grains(a wide variety), occasionally pasta. Olive oil everywhere. Very little meat or fish: 3-5 meals a month; I somewhat ignore other protein sources other than grain. Little vegetables during the winter time, mostly: onions, hot peppers, garlic, more variety there during summer. Minimum 1l of water daily. Don't abuse alcohol or cigarettes.  I am strict and conservative with my choice of foods, I don't consume conservatives, and mostly stick to minimally processed products. Cooking is somewhat of a passion of mine. If I set my mind to a particular mode of nutrition, I can keep it. So I'd like to learn the following: what nutrition fosters joint health? Or maybe you have comments on my mode of nutrition in general? "
3411,Testosterone and bodyfat correlation -- a myth or no?,"I've heard people claim that steroids or just even higher natural test with make the body remove fat regardless of diet. I think this idea comes from those YouTube fitness guys who do massive calorie binges and have ripped bodies year round. It's claimed that they can eat anything they want and never gain an ounce of fat because they're on such high amounts of exogenous testosterone and other drugs. Is this true? The guys on gear can lower their bodyfat constantly while still building loads of muscle and eat like pigs all day and have perfect bodies?  Naturals can't seem to do this -- or at least the people who claim to be. I have spend a long time trying to up my test naturally in hopes that my bodyfat will keep decreasing in spite of eating a constant calorie surplus, but it doesn't seem to make any difference. I raised my natty test from 435 to 830 over less than 2 years, but I don't seem to be losing fat any faster or building muscle any faster either. I feel a massive difference in libido and m  Common beliefs would have it that you just down 5 grams of trenbolone and clenbuterol and sit around all day and you'll be shredded with tons of muscle even if you worked out like twice a year only. Some natties murder themselves and reach six-pack ab bodyfat while looking like skeletons because they lose so much muscle when dipping under 10% bodyfat with no drugs and/or can't maintain it. Guys on gear seem to not only maintain but gain substantial muscle even while cutting.  How does this relate to testosterone? How can they eat so much and never get fat? Diet so much and never lose an oucne of muscle and even build some too?  Are drugs really that magical? "
3412,D-Ribose and keto,"Hoping someone can help me out on this,  I understand glycolysis is the breakdown of glucose(sugars) into pyruvic acid which is then oxidized further down a series of reactions to produce what we know as ATP (Adenosine Tri Phosphate), or the energetic ""currency"" of biological systems. The original sugar molecule is obviously derived from carbohydrates (if i remember correctly), which won't be in much abundance due to a ketogenic diet which I plan on starting tomorrow.   My question is while being on a ketogenic diet, can I supplement the initial glucose 4-carbons by taking d-ribose throughout my diet? This would in theory keep the advantages of a ketogenic diet, along with promoting ATP synthesis and significantly increasing my bodies anabolic potential and muscle growth that would normally be there if I had adequate carbohydrate intake.  Effects of Keto on weight training   Lack of ""pump"" Depleted Glycogen stores in muscle Fibers Lack of Endurance General Muscle loss Loss of strength   Can D-Ribose help get rid of these issues ? "
3413,Walking faster V/s Running,"What is difference b/n walking fast and running, which different muscles get activated are they different for both? I am asking cause I found my calves getting tightened more while walking fast while running does not cause this? "
3414,Preparing for moving to new house,"A friend of mine is moving to his new house in a week, and I am going to help him with heavy lifting.  However I am concerned with low-back injury prevention.   My question is : how to best prepare for such work given only one week ? Maybe back and abdominal exercises ? Thank you for your ideas and suggestions. "
3415,Correct dumbbell upright row with externally rotation,"Let me tell you a little bit of background first. At first, I have found a video on ATHLEAN-X, which is this one, that warns against doing doing barbell upright row. This is because the exercise will causes shoulders to internally rotate while lifting weights and in turns leads to shoulder impingement. At around 3:58, the trainer goes on to say that dumbbell version of the upright row allow shoulder to externally rotate. So, what I am after is an instruction about to do it correctly.  The first one I've found by googling is from bodybuilding. But by looking at the image, I think it's not quite right because it looks like shoulder would still internally rotate if I follow this instruction. The second one clearly rotate shoulder externally, but I doubt whether doing it this way will work the same muscle groups as it supposed to be in the barbell version. Specifically, it doesn't look like that it will put the load on trapezius that much. "
3416,Building a custom upper body routine,"My doctor has instructed me to stop doing all leg exercises, and as such I know have to revise my workout routine. I am considering building a custom A/B split upper-body routine and doing my rehabilitation + abs on the rest days. Here is what I came up with off the top of my head:  A/B Split Routine:  _____________ A ____________|____________ B ______________ | Overhead Press 5x5        |   Overhead Press 5x5       | | Bench Press 5x5           |   Bench Press 5x5          | | Bentover Barbell Row 5x5  |   Bentover Barbell Row 5x5 | | Pull Ups 3x15             |   Chin Ups 3x15            | | Wide Push Ups 3x30        |   Inverted Row 3x8         | ----------------------------------------------------------   Rehab:   Gastroc - 5 minutes Piriformis - 5 minutes Hip abductor - 5 minutes Glutes - 10 minutes Planks - 5 minutes Side Planks - 5 minutes Cable Crunch - 3x20 (200lb)   A one week sample would be:   A / Rehab / B / Rehab / A / Rehab / rest  I have two concerns with this program:   There is not enough rest. Even though the rehab portion is just stretching and can be done anytime, the abs portion has me slightly worried I might over-stress my body when it should be resting. Is this a valid concern? Not enough exercise diversity. I am concerned that my exercises might not be as balanced as they could be. What upper-body exercises should I add or take away from the program to make it more balanced? (leg exercises are off the table)  "
3417,Does losing weight impede endurance training (Specifically cycling but also in general)?,"This is somewhat related to the losing weight/gaining muscle question found here, but I would like to find out if there are any studies or knowledge of weight loss impeding the physiological adaptations of endurance exercise training.  There are certain adaptations that occur with endurance training, such as the enhancement of Type IIa and IIb fibers, which includes fiber growth and hypertrophy. Blood vessels grow into the muscles to aid in oxygen transport, the body gets more efficient at using fat and increases the mitochondrial count in the muscles themselves.  This study looks at the physiological and metabolic changes that occur, and would suggest that there was no weight loss in the group (Since the VO2 did not change, weight did not change as weight is central to the VO2 calculation), so it is possible to increase endurance in the short term without weight gain/loss. Also, it is possible to get more fit while losing weight in untrained people.  However, over the long term there are certain physical changes that occur. Specific to cycling, the upper legs and calves can get quite large. You see this most markedly in sprinters, but also in endurance cyclists, just not quite as pronounced. Common sense and the above referenced question would indicate that the muscle growth associated with endurance training might be hampered with weight loss, but would this also impact the changes that occur internally? (Fiber density increases, mitochondrial increases, blood vessel growth). And in the case of untrained people, is there a middle ground where no more fitness/endurance can be gained without gaining weight in the short term? Any information is welcome, but studies are preferable. "
3418,Why does consuming 30 g of protein within 30 minutes after waking helps to lose weight?,"Tim Ferris writes in his books ""The four hour body"" and ""The four hour chef"" about using this 30/30 rule to burn fat. All I have found about the ""Why?"" is that after fasting for seven to eight hours the body starts burning muscles. The high protein input will direct the body to burning fat.  Has anybody done a study about this? What are the underlying metabolism mechanics? Would it also work during the day after not eating for a long time or has it something to do with REM/Non-REM sleep? "
3419,How much carbs the day before a marathon?,"I'm running my first marathon on Sunday.  I read on the internet that you should eat 4 grams of carbs per pound the day before the race.  At 185 pounds, I would have to eat 740 grams of carbs!  Does that sound right?  What would I even eat to get that much?  4 bagels (which is a lot of bagels imo) is only about 250 grams of carbs.   "
3420,Is it worth getting measured for running shoes?,"I started jogging a few years ago, it's mostly been a hobby till now, I'm running the silverstone half marathon at the beginning of march.   I've only ever spent around £30 on trainers for running, and they've never been amazing, but they've never completely debilitated me either. I've had a few problems here and there with blisters, and the outside of my foot aching, balls of my feet hurting as I've upped the distance in the last year or so. Which seems normal.  Is it going to be worth it to me to go and get measured properly and spend £90+ on running shoes? I'm not sure how useful the measurement service is, it sounds very much like a gimmick to take my money to give me ""tailored"" shoes. But then lots of people reccomend them.  Tl;Dr;  Is a running shoe measuring service, and therefore a more expensive shoe, a good investment to get more suitable shoes to go on my precious feet. Or is it a way to make people with more disposable income than they know what to do with buy some trainers that are a different colour depending on the smell of their feet.  I'm looking for something a little more than ""I bought some, didn't like them"" or ""Yes because my feet smell lovely now"".   Note: This isn't a paid for service, but by using it you're opening yourself up to buy much more expensive shoes based on their advice. I'm worried their advice is tosh :)    Update  I went to a store last night (won't recommend individual store here as I've only ever been to one, unless that would help?) and they were brilliant, got me in a neutral pair of shoes on the treadmill to start, analysed my running, and showed my in slow motion what their conclusions were and why. (I was pronating, bending my feet inwards as I put weight on them)  Then brought me out 3 different pairs all with the correct support for me to try out for ""feel"". They were really informative throughout and I now know what to look for in my next pair.   I bought one of their recommended ones for £100. I was weary at first, but the offer a 30 day guarantee so even after 29 days of hard use, I can take them back and exchange them, get another analysis or just return them. Doesn't seem like I can loose. Now to try them out tonight.    Later Update  Nearly a year on I'm still wearing these same shoes and they're still brilliant. Admittedly I don't jog quite as often as I did when I bought them but still between 1 - 3 times a week.   Highly recommend getting an analysis for anyone reading this. "
3421,Effects of altitude on athletic performance,"It is well known that the performance of athletes who suddenly move to a location at a higher altitude than they are used to will suffer; when sports events such as the Olympics are held in a high altitude location, athletes often move to the area much earlier in order to adapt.  The question I haven't been able to find an answer to is: How big of an altitude difference is significant? E.g. Will a sprinter who lives and trains at sea level feel any different competing at 200 - 300 m above sea level? "
3422,Creating a swimming workout schedule,I'm looking to create myself a good swimming workout schedule and need some advice. What is the best schedule to get optimum results? How often should one have rest days? I'm currently looking at approximately 5 30 min swims a week (totaling about 5k in distance) but this could increase in the future. Am I better structuring my routine for longer workouts or more frequent?  I already do swim fairly often but without a fixed schedule. My main goal is fat burn.  
3423,How do I kick properly while swimming,"I am a beginner in swimming and it's been just 5 days into instructor lead coaching in the pool. I have mastered floating and classes are focused on freestyle.  I still don't know if I am kicking right. Here are the problems I face:   I am confused when someone says to kick straight leg, since my research on the internet and youtube is that everyone bends their knees to some extent When I start kicking I do move forward at very slow pace ( may be 8 kicks to get distance of 8 feet covered), but at some point of time i feel am unable to even lift my leg( sort of feels numb and then disappears as though nothing happened) Should my foot come outside the surface of water? Should I push the water surface when kicking(that might push me forward) ?   Is there a video, resource or anything that shows me how to kick properly with a illustration (may be in slow motion) "
3424,Trailrunning - What special considerations have to be made compared to regular running,"Recently, I have gotten back into running, so I signed up for a trail running event (16km distance, 650m climb, 650m descent) in 10 weeks and started training for it. I have some experience in training for and participating in 10ks and half marathons. For the time being, I'm trying to modify a cookie-cutter half marathon training plan for this specific run (If it's relevant, it is this one: Profi-Trainingsplan Halbmarathon, german only).   According to rules of thumb, the distance roughly checks out (add 700m-1000m distance per 100m climb => 20.5km - 22.5km for my run). But the program - like many others - don't really take climbing into account, so I'm sure there's a lot of room to improve specificity of such plans.  My question is:   How does a trail run differ from a regular running event of equivalent distance, and how do I take those differences into account when designing a program and during the race?  Some particular points I'm wondering:   Determining an intended pace for a run and checking whether you're on par during the race is relatively straightforward for a flat-terrain event. How do you properly set a goal for a trail run, and how do you keep track of where you are regarding that goal? How much of the training and which types  (long slow runs, tempo runs, intervals,...) should take place in hilly terrain, how much of it should stay in the flat? Is a consistent speed preferable, or a consistent heart rate? I learned the hard way that running downhill is deceptively easy on the cardiovascular system but incredibly taxing on the muscular tissue. Should downhill runs be incorporated in the training? How?  "
3425,Isometric deadlifts instead of barbell deadlifts,"Would an isometric deadlift be a good substitute for a normal, barbell deadlift?  I know that's difficult to engage as many muscles in the same way as barbell deadlifts. (I read Are there any alternatives to deadlifts? and Am I exercising all my muscles?). "
3426,What muscle or tendon pronates the foot when running?,"I've been running for the past five or so weeks, and have gone on a couple long (for me: 10k) runs in the last 2 weeks.  I developed a pain on the inside of my left ankle (non-dominant) that sometimes reaches up into my lower calf.  It seems to be especially painful while pronating and pushing off.  I probably pushed too hard on my last run, so I'll slow down in training for a while to build strength.  But what muscle or tendon is that?  And is there any other strengthening exercises to help it out? "
3427,"Can I train for 'mass' on some parts of my body, and 'strength' for others?","Is it possible to perform strength training on certain muscle groups and training for mass gain on others?  For example, I don't want big legs, but I of course want much stronger legs. Can I do strength training on my legs day (low repetitions and heavy weight) while purely working to put size on my upper body on their days (high reps, lower weight)?  OR will my body only do one thing at a time over a given timeframe? By that I mean, if I do my legs day for maximum strength gains and then for the rest of the week do training for size, will my body decide that it should just pack on size everywhere that I trained that week, or still honour my strength workout for legs?  This could include body parts that are related / close together like say if I wanted to have stronger biceps but bigger triceps. "
3428,What to do after the R4FL training program?,"I am currently following the R4FL training program for running. It trains me to run up to about 60 minutes, but the last two weeks are mostly intervals, sprints and Fartlek runs.        where:   Steady = 70% Max HR 8x3 min fast = Interval Training: Alternate between 3 min of high intensity with 2 min of light recovery. 3x10 intervals = Split Training. These are 10 min bouts of intense work. Should be near maximal effort for the recommended time. Recover with walking in between. 150:30 Intervals = Sprints: Alternate between 30 sec of super high intensity with 150 sec of light recovery (15x) 45 min Fartlek: Fartlek Run. Use random period of intervals of high intensity. Combine periods of near maximum effort with recovery. Use your own ability to determine how long each period is   Once I finish the program, what types of runs should I do to maintain the same training level? Should I simply do 60 minutes runs, or also use intervals? If so, which and how often? "
3429,What does each weight plate weigh in standard gym equipment?,"At the gym, some of the equipment doesn't have the weight listed on the individual weight plates, just numbers. For example, the ""Hoist Fitness Systems CL2403 seated leg press"" just has numbers for each weight plate, from 1 - 21. Here is a diagram of the actual CL2403 weight stack:    So:   How much weight am I actually lifting when I set the pulley to lift different numbers of weight plates? How much does each small round ""add on weight"" weigh (that I can slide over onto the stack when the weights are at rest)? See at the top right of the weight stack:   Will these answers be consistent across all weight lifting equipment, or does it change from manufacturer to manufacturer?   I have searched online and found lots of pictures of equipment, and lots of equipment for sale, but haven't been able to find anything at all on the weight bars and their specifications, let alone anything definitive.  For what it's worth, I primarily use free weights rather than isolation machines. I simply had some upper body muscle soreness the other day and could not trust myself to use anything but lower-body machines that day. I have only a couple of months of consistent gym use under my belt.  Last, you might ask why I want to know? Because I am entering my exercises in a spreadsheet and charting them. I have lost 8 pounds already, without really dieting (besides working to avoid soda and frivolous sweets). Seeing my strength and workouts improve on the chart is motivating. I'd like to enter reasonable values when I do end up using some of the machines. "
3430,How do typical San Francisco marathon times compare to flat courses?,The San Francisco marathon has substantial elevation changes (over 800 feet total).   How does this effect the typical times it takes runner to complete this course as compared to perfectly flat courses?  Say my time on a flat course is 3:30. What should I expect for the SF marathon? What if my time was 4:00 on a flat course? 
3431,Proper running form - landing on balls of feet?,"I've had trouble with shin splints, my IT band, and extremely sore ankles / knees before from long runs before.  In order to try preventing this, I've switched landing on my heel while running to landing on the balls of my feet. Does this help lead to a proper running form? Should I try something else?  "
3432,I seem to lose muscle size quickly if not working out for some time. Why?,"Not months of lay off but no more than 10 days takes my muscles, especially of my arms, from looking big and feeling hard to something that doesn't make me look like I lift serious weight. It stays in good shape and feel for up to a week of not working out but anything more than that and this happens.  Why does this happen?  I don't lose strength though. I consume enough protein as well.  Is this just my body type or is there any solution for this? "
3433,How does the different loading techniques in bulagrian split squats compare?,I know several different methods of how to load a bulgarian split squat:   use dumbbells or kettlebells by your sides use a dumbbell or a kettlebell in goblet position use a barbell in front squat position use a barbell in back squat position use a barbell between your legs   How does those loading techniques compare with respect to:    which muscles are involved more or less functional training effects safety which joints are stressed more or less   Are there any good reasons to prefer one of them?  Are there any points in technique which changes significantly with the loading technique? 
3434,Pain in forearm while doing bicep curls,"When i'm doing curl or bicep exercise (more when my palm face the ceiling) I feel pain in my forearm between my wrist and my elbow. The pain is situated on the side of the ulna.  The pain seems to come when I release my grip.   Did someone know from where it's coming; muscles, nerves, ... ?  EDIT : I've check with a professional and it seems to be my muscle the ""Extensor carpi ulnaris""   Did someone know if it come from a bad form or too much weight ?   Thanks "
3435,How fast swimming increases lungs volume?,"It's easy to find a lot of information of how much swimmer's lungs are bigger than in general population and how it compares to other activities (with musicians playing wind instruments being on the top), however I've failed to find any information of how much time does it take for a swimmer to develop such a big lungs volume.  Is it because the studies were focused on professional swimmers, which swim from the childhood and already have increased lungs volume?   If, say, a hiker who was never training swimming in his life would like to go for swimming as the mean to increase lungs volume as a help for altitude adaptation, how many years of training would it require to gain significant effect?  "
3436,Weights + Conditioning circuit + Mixed martial arts,"I'm thinking of starting a regime, where I hit my local gym 3 hours a day 6 days a week. I  am 5'7"" with a moderate build and I weigh 65kg. I'm wanting to build muscle and lose fat.  The first 1hr involves weight training, (working a different body part every day)  2nd hr a conditioning circuit of callisthenic exercises, battling ropes, kettle bell swings, bulgarian bags, deadlift clean and press squats etc (30 seconds on each 15 seconds rest between sets, 2mins rest between circuits).  3rd hour is my mixed martial arts class focusing on wrestling and padwork.  With the right diet, would this make me hit my goals? Or is this overwork and could result in my muscles cannibalising themselves? I really enjoy the mma and circuit work which is why I want to include them in my training.  Thanks  Ade+ "
3437,Is this the correct way to do full body workouts?,"I am a beginner in fitness. Last year, I have done bro-splits and this year I am doing full body workouts. I workout 3 times in a week (M, W, F) for about 1hr 30mins. A sample workout for a day would be: bench press, shoulder press, squats, cable curl, triceps pushdown, lat pull down + 15mins of cardio.  Let's say for chest, I have done barbell bench press on Monday, dumbbell bench press on Wednesday, Incline bench press on Friday. Next Monday, continue doing all the other chest exercises. I do this for all other workouts. This way, different parts of chest is getting activated every 3 days.  All the full body splits I have seen online talks about mostly repeating same set of exercises not like what I am doing.  My question is: is it better to follow what I am doing? Or is it better to cover all body parts in a single week and change the variations next week. eg: do bench press, incline press and decline press in a week and do flies next week.   I'd like to get some feedback on the process that I am following. Is this the correct way to approach full body workout? "
3438,Diet on Starting Strength - Should I eat the same on my rest days as on my workout days?,"This link gives a nice outline of the diet on a training day - but I can't find any reference to what one should eat on a rest day (i.e. since SS is a 3-day workout, what to eat on the other 4 days?)  Is it the same stuff minus the pre/post workout meals? "
3439,Are many short trainings per day on elliptical training machine somehow effective?,"I work at home and I bought an elliptical training machine. So I can train as many times per day as I want. It would be comfortable for me to work for about 30 minutes and then make 5 minutes break for training.  My work day is about 8 hours, so I could make 16 breaks and it would be 80 training minutes per day. I understand that short trainings not so effective as long-time trainings, but how critical is it?  For example calories indicator shows me that I burned 60 kcal per 5 minutes. So will I burn 60*16 = 960 kcal per day or short trainigs will negate this effect? What about endurance training? Heart training? How much less effective such short trainings will be in comparison with long time trainings if they are equal in time? "
3440,Hanging workouts frequency -weights-breathing-speed,"I want to ask about abs.   My food is ok, I eat healthy foods I do other workouts for abs I was doing abs every day I have little body fat (I would like to calculate it somehow. I weigh 70kg and am 1.80m tall)   Now I want to stop exercises for abs and focusing only on one exercise; I want to focus to on hanging abs workouts.  I want to increase my abs visibility. I am beginner at hanging but I have the power to lift my legs up.  My questions are:    First, to take a bag. I will add to the bag inside weights 10kgs. I will close the bag and when I am hanging I will lift this bag with my legs. As a result, I came to this question how much should I do (day / minutes / times) is this exercise with weights good?  Second, fast or slow or normal? I mean should I do the movements fast or slow? How many minutes? I have listen day only 5 minutes else you don't gain abs (true or false?)  Breathing, when should I exhale and inhale?  "
3441,Should I do more reps or take more rest?,"Many programs that I've come across (e.g. 100 push up challenge, 7 weeks to 50 pull-ups, etc.) prescribe a minimum rest time between sets and mention that you can take longer breaks if necessary, but when is it necessary?   For such program, would it be more beneficial to wait as long as I think is needed to perform every rep, or to keep the resting time as close as possible to that which is prescribed and repeat a week if I fail to perform the minimum number of reps, or some other variation of this?  My goal is mainly to achieve as many reps as possible in one go (training for a fitness test). "
3442,What's a good body weight exercise to build pectoral strength or mass?,"I'd like to work on pectoral strength, and I'm wondering what different techniques there are for building that using bodyweight.  Is it not realistic without a bench press?  I currently do wide-arm pushups, but I'm not sure if I should be doing them quickly, or trying to hold longer.  Are there other exercises for this as well? "
3443,How to increase pull up repetitions,"I'm doing pull ups from a bar, but I'm only able to get about 3 repetitions. After 3 times my biceps can't lift my head up the bar.  I am doing ab exercises as well, but that hasn't increased my rep count.  How can I increase the number of pull ups I can do?  I'm looking for instruction on the technique for doing proper pull ups:   How much distance between my hands? Which way should they be facing? How should I be breathing during the exercise? Should I do reps as fast as I can, or should I do slow pull ups?   I'd also like supplementary exercises to help increase the number of repetitions I can perform. "
3444,How to improve symmetry in both strength and size,"I have noticed lately that I lack symmetry in my arms (biceps and triceps, not forearms). This lack of symmetry also follows through to the strength and endurance in the weaker arm.  With my dominant hand (right), I have no issues with aesthetics and strength, however this does not translate across to my other arm. I have huge issues with the way the left arm looks and the strength issues that are starting to follow suit. I usually do exercises using barbells and some isolation exercises using drop sets on my pump week.   I would like to know:   How could I improve the aesthetics or size of the weak side? How can I improve the strength in my weaker arm to get it up to a similar level as my dominant arm?  "
3445,Tennis complementary exercises?,"For almost 3 years now, i've been swimming (2km in 35 min) everyday... and for the last 6 months i went back to a old fashion: tennis... i've been playing it almost on a daily basis and getting better at it (currently playing 4-4.5)... I imagine that due to the enormous repetition of the crawl stroke movement it should make your arms less prone to tiredness... Also, its a good cardio workout...  On the other hand I imagine that it does not emphasises the ""explosion"" part of the movement...  So... Is swimming a good complementary exercise for tennis? any pros swim? "
3446,Are there adverse side-effects when creatine is not taken with liquids?,"I bought some Optimum Nutrition creatine (Creapure blend of creatine monohydrate)  and it does not dissolve in liquids. When I stir the creatine into a sugary drink or even plain water, the crystals get stuck on the side of the glass. To not waste the creatine, I am thinking of taking the creatine without liquids.    Directly from the spoon to the mouth. Would this make it too concentrated and thus dangerous? Sprinkling it on cooked food. Will the heat destroy creatine? Sprinkling it on cold foods. Is this the safest way?  "
3447,Prevent Injuries At Home Gym on Carpet,"I have started some exercise programs at home such as P90X and Insanity.  However, I have found that working out on my carpet has proven to be difficult in a number of ways.  For example, when jumping around, I will often get carpet burn injuries on my feet.  When doing the various forms of pushups I, again, will sustain burns to my hands.  These can become really painful and have limited my success in these programs.  What are some methods that I can use to help prevent related injuries when working out at home and on a carpeted surface?  Additionally, I sweat a lot during these programs and am worried if the carpet my start to take on a smell or become more difficult to clean.  Are there any suggestions for this as well? "
3448,"Barbell ""hip press"" for pecs - viable exercise?","Context: for my workouts I can only consider free weights and bodyweight exercises (home gym with power rack). In my chest workout I currently perform:   bench press (barbell) flys (dumbbell) hip press (dumbbell)   That last exercise isn't too well-known, as the only videos I can find are [website]However, I'd like to replace this exercise with a barbell exercise (for supersetting reasons, having only one set of dumbbells).  My first solution was to do the same movement but replacing the dumbbells with the barbell.  Question: can such a hip press with a barbell be considered useful and safe (because, as far as I know, this exercise doesn't seem very common)?  I have tried it once for 3 sets of 12, and it does seem to activate the chest muscles in a focused manner. I was lying on the floor (as Scooby suggests) to prevent an overly extended range of motion. Furthermore I have used an underhand grip, this may not sound intuitive, but with a straight barbell this keeps the elbows automatically tucked in.  "
3449,Ankle exercises with bosu ball,Years ago I tripped in a hole and got a 3rd degree ankle sprain. One of the exercises the physiotherapist told me was to use a bosu ball and do circles with while standing with both feet on it. I think I stopped my recovery exercises to early and am trying to strengthen my ankle. I've been using the bosu ball but find it too hard to to do circles. I always slip off. Is there any tips to make it easier.   For example is it easier or hard to have feet spaced far apart? What are other exercises I can do to strengthen my ankle with a bosu ball?  EDIT: thanks for the feed back. I forgot to mention I had been doing it with no shoes and my socks slide against the slick surface of the bosu ball. Should I be doing it with or without shoes? 
3450,My knees hurt after I run and my feet point out or knees point in,"Short version: My knees point in when my feet point straight. This makes it hurt when I run.  I'm currently 16. In 9th grade, I switched out of my public school to an independent study one. It's like home schooling, but I meet with a teacher once a week for assignments and do everything myself. It was half way through the year that I switched. I had been running in PE that year and never had any problems. I had finished PE, so it wasn't until a while later when I started running for my own health and not for school. I stretched properly and started off small, but my knees hurt when I stopped running. For a month or two I built up to three miles of slow jogging, but my knees would still hurt.   I started looking online and read something about crows feet, or a similarly named condition. Basically, my feet and knees aren't aligned properly. If my feet point forward, my knees point inward and will touch if I bend them. If my knees point forward, my feet point out. I hadn't noticed this before, but I wasn't looking either, so I don't know how long my legs have been like that.   I talked briefly with a friend of the family who also happens to be a personal trainer. He said that my thighs were a bit weak and showed me an exercise where I sit against a wall and have to strain my muscles to keep myself up. He also said to ice my knees, as there's probably swelling. I did both for two months and saw no change, so I switched to squats. I did those for a while and still didn't notice anything.  Does anyone know anything about this? What can I do? "
3451,Overhead presses when hyperlordotic,"Doing standing shoulder presses, I'm very cautious not to learn backwards during the lift. My training partner and I specifically watch each other for this.  However even without weights when my upper body is upright, my lumbar region is already hyperlordotic. It's something I've been working on eliminating lately.  Two days ago during my second standing press workset, something popped under my left shoulder blade on a rep I was having trouble completing and pushing too hard.  It didn't hurt but it didn't feel right so I stopped the workout. That night was agony though, as was the next day, but it's getting better now two days later.  During overhead presses, I can feel my core under enormous pressure, like it's trying so hard to stop that lordotic curve increasing. I'm currently shoulder pressing 125 pounds, which I've slowly worked up to in a 3x5 fashion, increasing 2.5 pounds each time. I failed to do three sets of five the previous week at the same weight, managing only 3, 5 and 5.  I warm up before lifting with about 15 minutes of Cressey/Robertson's Magnificent Mobility mixed in with some hip flexor stretches and foam rolling.  Should I go to seated presses, fix the hyperlordosis or strengthen something else before doing presses again? Or simply not strain too hard to finish a tough rep? "
3452,How to improve leg lift in 3 legged downward dog pose,I am practicing yoga for the past 5 months. However I still struggle to lift the leg high up in 3 legged downward dog pose. The hanging leg does not cross more than 90 degree from ground despite 5 months of practice.   I would like to improve in this asana.    What excercises should I practice to  increase the leg lift in this particular pose?  What is the most worked muscle when we lift leg in 3-leg downard dog pose?  
3453,How can I prevent a slipped disk?,"I went to a massage/body therapy place while on holiday for a massage and was told by the guy that I have the beginnings of a slipped disk. They didn't speak English very well but I believe they said it was either the c6 or c7 one if that makes a difference.  What can I do to prevent the disk from slipping out?   I recently started to do weightlifting regularly (bench press, rows and deadlift). Should I stop doing these, especially the deadlift since it involves the back?  Are there exercises or stretches or anything else that I should or should not do in order to prevent/fix this?  The person told me that it may be because of sleeping or sitting. What are the best ways to sleep for this problem? Would sitting up tall, with back straight and shoulders back while at work (desk job) or while driving be better? "
3454,Are bigger AB wheels better?,I just bought a ab wheel and have been doing it for a few time by now but I noticed that a lot of videos on YouTube with ripped guys showing how to use the ab wheel they use much bigger wheels than mine.   Are bigger wheels better than smaller wheels ? If not why their size varies and which size is better for me? I wonder that the ripped guys use bigger ones for a reason right?  My AB wheel is about this size :    And I've seen guys using ones about this size :   
3455,chronic lower back pain treatment?,"I got some lower back pain 5 months ago when squatting heavy (with bad form) as well as doing weighted pullups and relaxing my back. In particular, relaxing my back with weights started the back pain; I guess the pulling force of the weights was too much for my spine. I have avoided squats and made sure to keep my back tight when doing weighted pullups (my back feels fine if I keep it tight), and I thought I recovered but last week I started doing squats and the pain came back. I kept good form, did not round my back, and even had a lifting belt, but I think my back cannot handle compression forces very well. Is there any way I can train for this, or do I need more rest? Are there any back exercises I can do? "
3456,"I'm kind of new to this creatine protein stuff, and need help","My schedule consists of me working out in the morning, around 7 am, eating 2 eggs before that cooked. after my workout I take my protein/creatine in the same bottle. Should I take it around supper too? I workout during the weekdays.  I need to know what I should be doing also to go from 160 to 180 in 4 months.   Also should I be switching my diet going from drinking pop and stuff to lean meats and protein foods with carbs? I heard from many people but they all have different strategies and it doesn't help.  Is there anything else I should take? "
3457,What is the effect of alcohol on the body?,"What are the effects on the body due to alcohol? Should I simply consider it as a carb in my macros or is it different (worse?) than that?  I’ve been bodybuilding for a year and a half and I haven’t been wasted since, but maybe this weekend I will. I want to know how much I can consume without affecting my gains too much. "
3458,How can I learn about dumbbells and the weight I should lift?,"I've asked a couple of questions recently. But this question is different. Now, I'm moving to next step.  I'm very skinny and I look very weak to most people I meet. My aim is to make my BMI normal.  My current weight is around 55 KG, height is around 175 cm.  Now, since I can't join a gym, I'm starting to make a start by eating more and doing some exercises at home (When I do Yoga, I eat little more than usual. I really believe doing exercise will also help me eating more). I'm about to buy dumbbells like these. I can afford only these.  Now, when I search about lifting weight as a beginner, I get great answers, but since I'm a beginner, I'm really really confused.  When they say start lifting by 2 KG, what does it mean? Does it mean first dumbbell of 2KG in left hand and another dumbbell of 2KG in right hand? Or is it overall?  Does a N Kg dumbbells mean = Weight of first dumbbell + Weight of 2nd dumbbell ? Or individual?  Or am I misunderstanding the word dumbbells also? Is the pair of two is called a dumbbell? or each is dumbbell and both are called dumbbells?   Secondly, you have idea about my BMI. Can you comment anything like how much weight should I lift as a beginner and what exercises should I start with dumbbells to gain normal weight and fix my BMI (not making a six packs and good looking muscles) so I don't look weak?  Again, these might seem many queries, but I'm a beginner and don't know how to proceed. "

3460,Building strength with Spondylosis (L5-S1 degeneration),"I realize this is a complex medical issue, but I've been frustrated with my lack of progress.  About two years ago I was finally struggling enough with my back pain (difficulty standing for long periods, pain when lying flat, difficulty due to pain when getting out of bed, etc) that I decided to visit a therapist and have some x-rays done.  They found that I have degeneration between the L5-S1 discs.  I was told that many people have this specific degeneration and that it really depends on the individual and how they react.  According to the PT, some walk around completely oblivious to it while others have major difficulties.  Fortunately I have progressed to somewhere between these two camps.  I can perform squats but I have some difficulty with keeping my back straight while lowering.  I have reduced the weight significantly in order to perform them correctly (or as best I am able).  Surprising to me is that planks, even on my elbows, are extremely difficult.  I'm not sure if this is a function of simply building strength or due to the degeneration.  There is some pain while doing them. Given this information, I'm wondering what people do since the general recommendation is to build strength and flexibility since there is no 'cure' for this.  Should I just be patient and keep at it?  Are there any ideas of what I can expect for progress?  Thanks for any information! "
3461,giving the left shoulder a rest. can I train squats and\or the right arm?,"Despite being cautious with the bench press I noticed I feel my left shoulder a bit more when I do reverse grip lat pull down as per the picture below.    I was considering training the right arms and\or squats, in order to give the left shoulder a rest.  can I still have benefits buy training only the right side plus squats?  where can I see more about this? "
3462,Is running almost every day bad during a bulking phase?,"I'm in a bulking phase and I like going for a run after my gym sessions (5 days a week). I estimate that I burn a little less than 500 Calories per run. Will these running sessions not affect muscle growth if I consume an extra 500 Calories (total 3,000 Calories) on those days to account for the extra Calories burnt? Or am I putting my body in such a deep catabolic state from running so often that I'm sacrificing muscle growth despite the extra calorie consumption? "
3463,How much am I undercutting gains if I slack on protein?,"In this question, the accepted answer for daily protein needs cites, ""0.8g/lb ... (body-building)"", meaning that if one is body building, one needs 0.8 g of protein per day per lb of body weight. I'm not trying to be a ""body builder"" in the sense of competitions, but I am trying to build my muscles, strength, and endurance, and so I used this figure.  (Perhaps that is inappropriate?).  The problem:  I am largely vegetarian (much of which is vegan), 170 lbs, and find that getting 0.8 * 170 = 136 grams of protein, each day, into my diet seems very tough--particularly since I am trying to lose fat while gaining muscle, and so am trying to keep calories low enough to lose fat.  I generally don't eat breakfast and my lunch is about 20 g of protein, so this leaves a 116 g at dinner....nearly impossible for me based on my typical diet.  Although I've been lifting weights on and off for about a year and a half, I'm sure I've rarely if ever hit that 136 gram amount.  I have clearly made some gains over that time (going from 0 pull-ups to 11), but generally am dissatisfied with my strength and endurance progress.  Part of that is clearly an insufficient training regimen, which I can work on, but I've wondered if I am working at a sizable disadvantage by not consistently hitting this 136 grams.  RELATED QUESTIONS:    So, first, to be clear:  is that full body weight or only lean body mass? As someone who wants to do a modest-medium transformation (lose 20 lbs of fat, gain maybe 10 lbs of muscle?...within 6-10 mos?), is the 0.8 g/lb of body weight the right value? To what degree could ""under-proteinizing"" my diet be holding back progress?     "
3464,Are these exercises okay for weight gain for an underweight person?,"NOTE: Yes I'll eat also, not only exercise :)  I read many questions where exercises were mentioned for beginners to (eat and) gain weight.   dumbbell squats  dumbbell lunges  dumbbell sit-ups  dumbbell calf raises dumbbell step ups   Are these okay to start with? And where can I find guidance how to do them with dumbbells? I know nothing about it!  For example, for squat, I think it's just an exercise without any equipment, like sitting and getting up quickly! But I guess it's wrong! "
3465,"I am hitting walls with my lifts, how can I progress?","I've been working out at the gym for a fair few years now (around 6). Started by just going with a friend doing random weights. Then progressed to muscle groups. For the last 6 months I have been trying the strong lifts method.  My squat has increased immensely so I definitely know the system works (for me). My question is that I'm hitting walls all over the place at the moment. Squats 100kg, bench press 90kg, standing rows I am still progressing, standing press 57.5kg, deadlift 135kg. I'm getting half way through my 5x5 sets and failing at everything but rows so far. How can I overcome this? is it a question of perseverance and I will slowly be able to pass my walls?   My goal is to gain lean muscle mass. I'm currently around 80kg, 5ft.10"", BF 15%. I do MON/WED/FRI at the gym (my big days) then TUE &amp; THURS some shoulder work and abs / whatever takes my fancy. Also do martial arts 2/3 lunchtimes per week. I eat well and take protein supplements after workouts.  Thanks james   "
3466,How to determine how much weight should you start with for dumbbell squats and sit-ups as a beginner?,"For an underweight skinny adult, how much weight is recommended?

NOTE: If this question seems opinion based, kindly share the available sources if you know any, where I can read about this. That will be helpful. "
3467,Why do many parkour practitioners wear oversized pants?,"When you start poking around parkour videos, you'll start to see a trend of people wearing extremely baggy pants, often with the crotch hanging down to about knee level. This is particularly odd to me since you'll also find references to using duct tape to tape down baggy clothing to reduce air resistance, specifically taping down the cuffs to keep from tripping on them and to keep them from catching on obstacles.  The closest I've found to an explanation is this article, which posits that it's a combination of follow-the-leader (everyone else is wearing baggy pants, so it should be good, right?), hiding sloppy technique (baggy pants hide the fact that your legs aren't quite moving together by masking the outline), and comfort (when not doing jumps, baggy pants are just plain comfortable).  So, is there any particular reason why so many parkour practitioners wear extremely baggy pants? "

3469,How can I train for a 5K while strength training with StrongLifts 5x5 and minimizing detrimental effects on either?,"I followed the Couch-to-5K training program several months ago in preparation for a 5K race but have not run at all since then.  I'd like to get back into it by doing Couch-to-5K again.  I'm doing StrongLifts 5x5 now, though, and wasn't doing any kind of strength training the last time I trained for a 5K (nor for a few years before that).  I've been on StrongLifts for about 8 weeks now with no stalling yet and would like to follow both programs concurrently without one causing problems for the other (or at least minimizing the impact).  Both are 3-day-per-week programs, so I'm unsure of how to best schedule them.  Am I better off doing StrongLifts in the mornings and Couch-to-5K in the evenings on the same days, or alternating days between StrongLifts and Couch-to-5K?  Is there another another arrangement that might be better? "
3470,Can I be serious about getting into great shape if I have an office job?,"I'm a web developer. I spend 5 days a week, 8-10 hours per day in front of my PC in a chair.  I want to get in insanely good shape. I don't mean I want to be a little stronger than the average person, or able to run a little further. I don't care what I look like vs the average person. I want to be that guy that stands out in a crowd of 100's of people as being in amazing shape.  I'm pretty sure this isn't possible. I feel like if I wanted to be serious about this goal that I would have to change my career to something that is physically demanding; like a ranger or a labourer. I have even considered, being barely 21, the thought of going to university and using my time there as the time in my life where I will have this ultimate body.  With this amount of time being used up sitting down, should I abandon the idea of getting to that level of physique? Is it impossible to achieve unless I am a full time athlete, or can I push myself before and after work, over the weekend and anywhere in-between to reach my goal of a muscular, ripped body?  If it makes it any easier, I am much more interested in appearance than brutal strength or being able to run 100's of kilometres.  I want to know if it's possible to get here with the amount of sitting I need to do during the week:    Or if I'm going to find it impossible to get past this type of level unless I find a way to get active during the day too:   "
3471,How to efficiently stretch Pec Minor (Pectoralis Minor) for rounded shoulders,"For about 20 years now, I have had rounded shoulders due to too mostly too tight Pec Minor muscles. I've been trying to change that for about a year now. My investigations on the internet brought me to some very useful information and classical stretch exercises, eg. Jeff Cavalier on Youtube.  Well, I have been doing the Pec Minor stretching as explained by Jeff for about 1 year always after my workout. Unfortunately without real results.  One main problem is that I can't repeat this exercise more than once per day. After doing it once, I don't feel a stretch in the Pec Minor anymore. I rather feel a stretch / light hurt in the shoulder or arm. I guess that the muscle is just as much stretched as it can for the day, but I somehow think I should stretch it more than once in order to make more progress.  Today I started some more investigations and found this article. It's from 2012, but explains some concepts quite well. It states, that there exist various types of stretching: static, dynamic and pre-contraction stretching. There I also learned, that since I want to correct my posture, it's important to stretch for extensibility and not range-of-motion. So maybe I have been stretching for range of motion only so far.  Any ideas how I can stretch the Pec Minor more efficiently? Are there other techniques than leaning against a door frame?  Some scientific advice from an expert, own experiences on this topic or new stretching tips would be really amazing. Thanks. "
3472,Is there a general purpose sneaker for casual sports activities?,"I am looking for a pair of athletic shoes that I can wear for various sports. Despite martial arts being my main regular form of exercise, once in a while my friends will get together for an impromptu game of basketball, ultimate frisbee, dodgeball, or tennis.  For martial arts, we have our own flat-soled shoes with minimal cushioning. Outside of that, I have not owned any athletic sneakers since I started practicing kung fu. I have seen other questions on the site asking whether one shoe for one particular activity is also good for another. Some answers say that it's okay to use the same shoes, and others say there is a difference.  Is there a shoe that would be suited for the activities I listed? More specifically, is there any type of shoe that is suited for asphalt surface (the typical outdoor surface I play on)? Does one type of shoe make a difference over another for these activities? "
3473,Should I bulk up or keep cutting fat?,"I'm hitting gym for 6 months, When I started I had about 20% of body fat, I was a skinny guy with big fat belly. Now after 6 months of weight training and cardio I reduced body fat to 14% without lossing or gaining weight and I a have a better upper body.  Now I like to put on 5kg (11.5lbs) and I want to reduce body fat to 10%. My current wieght is 65kg (143Lbs).  1) Should I keep reducing my body fat, and once its reaches 10% start caloric excess diet?  or  2) Should I start a caloric excess diet and gain weight, once I reach my goal cut the fat to 10%?  3) If I do second approach, will I gain more body fat on weight gain?

3474,"Is it possible to learn to ""feel"" that the right muscles(s) are being exercised?","This is about the kind of muscle exercises done by people for bodybuilding or strength training, where they want to focus on strengthening a specific muscle (or set of muscles).  Is it possible that these individuals can learn to feel that their exercise is actually strengthening the correct muscle(s), without testing/measuring the muscle(s) afterwards?  Or are even experienced people always dependent on either correct technique or on testing/measuring the muscle(s) afterwards? "
3475,Preventing upper back from rounding while squatting,"My current bodyweight is 65kg  and I am doing StrongLifts 5x5 for past two months. I am stuck between 70-75kg squat. Until 65kg squat it didn't matter much how my form was. I know that, I used to neither engage my abdominals &amp; obliques by holding breath nor used to keep my 'chest up' and keep my upper body tight. As a result, my squat used to look more like GoodMorning Squats. But I continued squatting with such terrible form till 75kg. But then I couldn't make any further progress.  Realising my mistakes (based on formcheck on reddit), I deloaded to 67.5kg and started incorporating 'chest up' &amp; 'holding breath'. My form improved very much. But I was unable (I was trying my best) to maintain 'chest up' during last 2-3 reps of 3rd, 4th &amp; 5th sets at 70kg. I tried on the next workout day but face same issue. I deloaded further to 65kg and started working my way up. I could hold it at 65kg &amp; 67.5kg but at 70kg I faced same issue. I then started doing 70kg squats for first 2 sets and 65kg for last 3 sets but I am still facing the same problem during last 2 reps of 4th &amp; 5th sets.   Question: However hard I try to keep 'chest up' my upperback is collapsing and rounding while moving up during last reps of last sets. What do I do? Should I do any supplementary exercises? Is this problem going to go away? Am I going to make progress further? Will I reach my dream of squatting double my bodyweight?  Also I'm starting to dislike squats. I actually want to love them but I'm getting that resistance in my brain.  EDIT: I'm quite happy with my progress in other exercises. DeadLift: 95kg, OHP: 33kg, BenchPress: 42.5kg, Barbell Row: 45kg.  I don't know if it is relevant but during deadlift, while pulling, my upper back is rounding but once I reach the top most position, everything is locked and I attain perfect 'chest up'  EDIT 2: Update after today's workout session incorporating suggestions given in the answers  I had a wonderful workout session today.I've deloaded my squats to 62.5kg, as suggested by StrongLifts App and for the first time ever, squats felt more like an Abdominal workout when I incorporated following suggestions in doing them:   I didn't lean too much forward at the bottom of Ass-to-grass squat. Only Approx 30 degrees I didn't lift my elbows up behind as high as I could. I stopped where I felt was sufficient. After holding air inside my belly, I squeezed my abs to the maximal possible extent. When I was struggling to rise up, during that short span of struggle, I squeezed and pulled the bar into my body, as if I'm slicing my body with bar, and simultaneously, I pushed my chest towards chin with force (Honestly, all of this happened naturally). I felt this really helped in preventing upper back from rounding. Another cue, which happened by accident but really helped is, for around 15 sec before approaching the bar for a set, I stood with chest up and I stood for 5 sec  in front of the bar with chest-up position and then started a set. I don't know, somehow it really helped me.   I felt burning in the abs after every set. I also did Over-head-squat at 30kg @ 3sets x 8reps, just after Squats. They were just forcing me to keep everything in order. I really loved them.  I'll update again when I reach the 75kg squat. "
3476,Meal timing to minimise muscle loss when in calorie deficit,"I want to improve my body composition by losing fat with minimal muscle loss. I also want to maintain my current level of fitness.  I do resistance training some mornings and cardio other mornings (bike or rowing machine). I am relatively sedentary the rest of the day apart from a brief walk or bike ride to and from work. The times I exercise are largely dictated by external commitments but I do have some control over when I eat.  In order to minimise the impact of a calorie deficit on muscle mass and general fitness:   does it matter when I eat, relative to strength training? does it matter when I eat, relative to cardio? can I/should I eat immediately before sleeping?

3477,Proper way to carry weight for long distance,What is the proper way to carry a fellow human being when they are incapacitated? I usually go for high altitude hikes and I find I need to be ready for an emergency. Which muscles would do better work?  Should I carry in my arms or on my back? 
3478,"When I bench press, why do my hips sometimes cramp up?","When I bench press, I sometimes feel a muscle seize up slightly distal and lateral from my ASIS. I don't know what muscle this is, but I'm guessing it's involved with external rotation or abduction. This happens sometimes in the left hip, sometimes the right hip, sometimes both simultaneously.  It happens when I'm arching my back hard, with glutes pressed against the bench, legs open at about a 30° angle and feet flat against the ground.  I find it hard to maintain the arch of my back off the bench without these muscles occasionally seizing.  Am I tensing up an area that I should be leaving relaxed? Is this a sign of improper form? "
3479,What kind of workout regimen can get me back in it?,"When I was in college, I used to pretty good at keeping up a decent workout schedule (three days a week during normal times, at least one day a week during extremely stressful exam weeks).  My workouts would usually be one of the following:   Running ~3 miles; ~45 minutes on the elliptical; or, General weight lifting (all major body parts, 10-20 reps at average weight, 5-10 reps at very difficult weight).   This ended pretty much instantly when I got an internship which required a four hour total commute every day.  I didn't have time for anything except driving, working, and sleeping, and I was basically living out of my car on fast food.  Since then, I've gotten a permanent position at the company and have relocated closer so that the commute is much better.  But in the intervening nine months, I've gotten very, very out of shape (definitely the worst shape of my life).  I've gained a lot of weight and my cardiovascular endurance is shot.  I've tried to hop on a treadmill or elliptical and do my old routine, but all that this accomplishes is me getting angry and hating myself for not being able to do it anymore and letting myself go.  I'm not a trainer and I don't know all the math and science behind fitness; I always just went to the gym and worked out, no problem.  Since my body just doesn't seem capable of doing what it once did, is there a good way I can ease back into it and get back to where I was?  How can I start, and how should I pace myself? "
3480,How to properly use Protein Shakes,"I have decided to give protein shakes a try (with no specific goal for now, I'm just interested in the effect) and since everyone seems to have a different opinion about them and several guides are even contradicting each other I wanted to ask here about how to properly use them:  I train about 3-5 (mostly 4) times a week for 60-75 minutes without a special dedication to muscle growth. I mainly do stamina and cardio workout (TRX and Cross) with bodyweight, so pull ups, push ups, burpees, plank, star jumpers, etc.).  Question 1: I'm sure additional protein always affects your body, but are specific exercises required to maximize the effect of protein shakes? I'm not really interested in lifting weights for that purpose and if I don't do that is the effect too little to bother?  Question 2: Most common information is that it's suggested to take 1g/1lb body weight. I'm not weighing very much (75kg or 165lb) and taking in 165g of protein seems way too much. On my package it says 30g per drink with 200ml of milk or water and that seems just about right for me - as someone who has no idea about all of this. On the other hand I don't know if they assume you consume multiple drinks daily. "
3481,Losing weight without losing body size?,"I recently lost a lot of weight (from 107kg to 90kg) using a combination of a lot of bike riding and some nutrition changes, but I don't see any difference in my body size - my gut seems the same size and so are the circumference of arms and legs.   Is this normal and healthy? Do I have to train the specific area I want to lose weight in?  "
3482,Why do I feel pressure in my ears while breathing hard?,"When I first started practicing kung fu, I went from zero activity to doing moderate to intense exercises three times a week. Often times, I would feel pressure in my ears when breathing really hard. After a few months, I didn't feel this pressure anymore. Recently though I experienced it again, but I was practicing when my body was in an overworked state.  The feeling of it is something like that moment before you pop your ears due to changes in air pressure (like when riding airplanes or elevators).  Is this a normal phenomenon? What can I do to make it subside or prevent it from happening? "
3483,Help and Tips needing for workout plan,"I am currently 15 years old. I am 6' tall and I weigh 157 pounds. I am not fat however I am not comfortable with my shirt off because of my unappealing, ""skinny-fat"" stomach and chest. My goal is to be proud of my body and comfortable with a shirt off by next summer. More specifically, Defined Upper body and core. My workout plan is geared towards slow, but steady progress. I am aiming towards small lifestyle changes and consistent exercise to reach my goal. So far I have made a simple plan open too tweaks as I go on. Here's my plan: I Bought a simple set of dumbells, and I am alternating between Upper body, and Lower Body workout days. For the workouts I do 4 sets of 10 Bicep curls, Tricep Extensions, Hammer curls, Tricep Kick backs, spyder curls, and finally push ups. On lower body days I do Weighted Squats, Weighted Crunches, Lunges, Halos, Goblet Squats, again 4 sets of 10 each side. Currently using two 15 pound dumbells but will increase weight as soon as I feel comfortable with the increase. I finish each workout with a protein bar. On top of the daily workout, I fill my day with plenty of cardio, and trying to make better dietary choices. Can anyone tell me if I will reach my goal with this program? if not, what changes can be made?  Thank you! "
3484,What is courtesy in a gym?,"I've always been kind of creeped out by gyms; many people doing things and no one is talking.   I started working at a place with a gym that has lots of machines in a relatively small space. I have no idea what's going on but sometimes when I go there appears to be a class and ladies telling people what to do.    Should I not be in the gym at this time?  Should I try to figure out which equipment they're going to use and not use it?  Once I noticed the bosu ball was placed under the table, does this mean I shouldn't use it? Since the class seems to be women only, is it frowned upon for a male to be working out in the gym at the same time?    It's hard to ask when the instructors are busy giving instructions and music is playing in the background.   Are there any common rules I should be aware of? "
3485,Mechanism and recovery of lower back pain?,"I normally recover from lower back pain just going to run.  It results from studying too much and sitting - skipping gym and sport during exam weeks.  It alleviates normally after one hour running.  This time however I tried to alleviate it in interval running (2 x 15 min) and see try again tomorrow (15 min x 2) and see during 3rd day how is the pain. Very cold water (for whole body, about 30-45 seconds) in Spa centers (colder than from tab) also causes very good burning sensation there in the lower back region.  Repeating it, shows that the pain sensation gets weaker. After this the pain also disappears.  In summary methods of alleviating lower back pain   1-1.5h hour running (usually requires longer time to relieve) interval running during three days (2 x 15 min, 2nd day 2 x 15 min, 3rd day 2 x 15 min) very cold water to alleviate it (30-45 seconds for whole body)   I have not found any stretching technique how to alleviate the lower back pain or to increase the blood circulation there.  How can you stretch the lower back?  I would like to understand better what is causing the lower back pain to plan better recovery and prevention programs from such pains.  What is the mechanism causing the lower back pain?  What is a good way of alleviating the lower back pain? "

3487,My daily calorie intake,"I calculated in [here][1] as it says 65kg male 175cm 29 yo, needs 3000 calories a day with following Activities every day. and I eat 500-1000 Calories everyday It means I lose 2000 Calories every day. 1 kg mean 7700 Calories(theoretically) so I need to lose 1kg every 4 days?

3488,What can I do to prevent cramps after 19 km?,"The last 3-4 times I have run half-marathon or similar distances, I have experienced the preliminary symptoms of cramps around the 19 km mark. It comes as a suddenly ""bite"" in the upper part of my calfs - it doesn't hurt all that much, but there are no doubt that is will if ignored... When the ""bite"" comes, I have to run more on my heels the rest of the race to avoid the ""bite"" develops into full-blown cramps - kind a like ""running calf stretch"" and not very comfortable.  The ""bite"" is usually first in the left leg, but after an additional 2-300 m, the ""bite"" is also present in the right leg. The faster the pace - e.g. during races - the earlier it will happen... If I stretch and walk for a few minutes when it happens and then start running again, the ""bite"" is sure to reappear again after 8-900 m...  Except for the night after one of these longer runs, I usually don't have cramps at night.  The accepted answer to Why do I get cramps all the time? sugests that it is a electrolyte imbalance and the problem is lack of salts like potassium, sodium, calcium, and/or magnesium. Lots of other articles - e.g. What are Cramps? How to prevent Cramps to mention one - sugest the same, so I can easily accept that.  But... what can I do about it? I really want to run these longer distances...  Are there anything specific I can eat or drink?  I usually eat lots of bananes (which contains potassium AFAIK), and have also consumed large amount of ""Tonic Water"" (which contains quinine), but neither of these seem to be enough.  Are there any specific gels (or whatever) that could help during the runs? Eating lots of bananes during a race, does not seem to help at all.  EDIT A little more background:  My average milage is 30-40 km/week - less in the Winter (now) and more in the Summer. I have run HM races 5 times in the last year and 17-24 km training passes 6-8 times in the same period. So, I should expect my general fitness as well as my LSR training to be OK.  The last training pass (a rather fast 18.8km yesterday) actually went pretty well - no bites - using a ""MAXIM GEL Drink"" at 8 km and plenty of Powerade at 5 km and 13 km. The training is part of Sparta Marathon Training leading up to Copenhagen Marathon in May. The training is a little short to be conclusive!!!  UPDATE (2012-01-28): I have begun to run longer during the week and - when that is not possible - use my bike to and from work. That has helped: I have not experienced any cramps since mid December. Thanks... "
3489,What is the least I need to run to maintain my conditioning?,"Sometimes you know that you have a very busy time ahead of you, and that you're going to have less time for fitness activities, for whatever reason (work, a new child, etc).  My questions is this- what is the least that I can safely run without risking injury?  Specifically, while training for a 10k/ half marathon this season I run about three times a week:   an intervals workout (2 km easy, 1 km fast, 500*2 very fast, 1 km fast, 2 km easy) a medium run, 10-14 km a long, slower run, 15-19 km   If I want to maintain my conditioning with relatively little deterioration, can I run just once a week, my long run? (because I enjoy the long, slow run most)  How many days gap in between such a run can I have before it becomes ""too much"" and it's better to add another (possibly shorter) run in between? "
3490,"Week without a gym, what instead?","I am doing Starting Strength program and I am going to my hometown for Christmas. I won't be able to access a gym there. What can I do instead?

Do you have some other ideas of how I can substitute regular training for a week? "
3491,Cold and fever after doing extensive cardio sport?,"Every Sunday I do soccer in the morning for two hours where I run non stop and sweat extensively. After the sport I take a shower and take the bus home, but by the time I get home my dry and clean shirt becomes soaking wet as I keep on sweating.  As the day advances I am starting to get a headache, and occasionally a smallish fever by night. This happens most of the time,and I have yet to solve this issue. Should I wear more clothes? Or change shirt multiple time? I also try to drink a lot, but I have not yet found a 100% solution. "
3492,Nutrition before sleeping during intensive training program,"Assume you practice 4 times per week in gym regularly and running once (30 minutes) per week.  Each training gym session is from 45 minutes to 1h 30 minutes.  I am in the mass building phase. I often forgot to eat enough food during day because I am studying too.  Therefore, I eat mostly during evenings and just before going to sleep. There are two problems when going to sleep   if I eat whey proteins (which have little creatine inside) or bread with proteins, my stomach swells and I feel pain in the transversum duodenum in the supine position but not in slightly elevated position.  The creatine may cause the symptom. so sometimes I decide not to eat before going to sleep but then I have to wake up and eat during night because I am so hungry and feel weak.   I am interested in how to regulate the diet in the evening and how to prepare for sleep.  What are good nutrients and how much and when exactly?  When you should eat creatine? I think not before going to sleep. "
3493,Strength Training Suggestions for Long Distance Running,"I'm a long distance runner (marathons and longer) and I'm beginning to incorporate strength training into my routine now that I'm in a bit of an off season for my races. My time for training is somewhat limited by work and family (my choice, priorities) but I have around an hour or so each day during lunch during the week to hit the weights (I have to devote the majority of my weekend to longer runs and I use that as a rest from the weights). So far (a month in) I'm seeing excellent gains and I'm just looking for some suggestions/critiques on my routine. I don't really have any room to budge on the running, that's priority, but I want to make sure that my lifting schedule is set up to maximize the time I have available. Here's a sample of what I'm doing currently:   Monday: 5x5 bench, incline DB, &amp; dips followed by 35 minutes of easy running  Tuesday: 5x5 squats followed by 45 minutes of speed work (pace varies)  Wednesday: 5x5 OH press, front raises, lateral raises followed by 35 minutes of easy running  Thursday: 5x5 deadlift, 1 arm DB rows, chins followed by 35 minutes of easy running  Friday: OH DB extensions, kickback, barbell curls, incline curls followed by 35 minutes of easy running  Saturday: Running (varies, some trail, tempo, etc) Sunday: Long run (12 - 30 miles depending on race schedule)   I take rest days from running as my body needs and won't hesitate to drop a run if my legs don't feel up to it. My diet is good, my weight hovers right around 195 and I'm between 10-15% BF depending on what tool I use to get it measured. I've increased my protein intake since I've added the weights and I'm getting between 100 &amp; 140g a day when I lift. Carbs and fat are at good levels, too.  My question(s): Does my lifting program look okay? Are there any exercises I should be adding/removing? Should I swap the lifting schedule around? "
3494,Pain in Front Part of Leg,"After running Just 5 minutes or so,(even while running very slowly) I get pain in lower frontal part of my leg. In fact, I get this pain even if I walk fast. It might be the bones or the muscles attached with the bones (I am not sure whether it's tibia or fibula). This pain gradually goes away if I rest half an hour or so!  Let me point out that I am not a regular ""runner"" and just started few weeks back. I run only during weekends but as I said earlier, the cause of pain does not seem to be running fast, as I get the pain even after walking fast.  Did anyone experience similar thing before? Do you have any suggestions? "
3495,Is just a pair of dumbbells enough?,"I started consulting in November 2012. The 4-hour a day commute tires me out and leaves me with absolutely no time to do anything else, much less go to the gym. So, I haven't gone to the gym since January 2013 and have since put back all the weight I had lost, and much more, and have lost shape.  I am going to start a 1-hour walk from tomorrow morning and my plan is to do free-weight dumbbell exercises after the 1-hour walk.  I've been so used to going to the gym that I am a bit unsure if just a pair of dumbbells would be enough?  Can I lose back all the weight, develop muscle tone and get back into proper shape with just a pair of dumbbells?  My plan is to:  1) Walk 1 hour for the next 30 days because I cannot jog or run with all the weight I have put on now.  Follow that with a few dumbbell exercises such as lateral raises, frontal raises, chest press, shoulder press, hammer curls, and concentration curls and full body-weight exercises like squats, lunges, side-lunges, push-ups, pull-ups, ab crunches and some stretching.  2) For the next 90 days, replace the 1-hour walk with a 40 minute jog. Then, do the same dumbbell and body weight exercises.  3) For the remainder of the year until 31st December 2013, replace the 40-minute jog with a 20 minute mix of jogging with short lapses of running (30 - 90 second lapses). Then, to follow that with a dumbbell and body-weight workout routine same as the one I described above.  I plan to do this workout 5 days a week and plan to lose about 57 lbs weight and gain some 10 lbs lean muscle mass after that.  All the walking, jogging and running I am planning is going to be on the ground.  I love the gym and still hold my membership there although I am totally unable to go because I leave home pretty early for work and come back very late at night. The gym is also quite far and in the opposite direction.  Therefore, I was planning on just doing the dumbbell and body-weight workout routine I outlined above.  Is this routine enough to get me back on shape or am I going to need to join the gym again? "
3496,"Apart from size, what properties make for a good exercise ball?","I wish to use an exercise ball as a chair. I have done this previously with several different brands of exercise ball, and it has worked for me in the past. I noticed that some balls were far comfier than others, but apart from the obvious effect of using an appropriately sized ball, I don't understand what causes one ball to be comfier than another.   What properties of an exercise ball make it more suitable for purpose as a chair? Where possible, how I can ensure a ball bought unseen (i.e. online) meets that specification? "
3497,High intensity with/without breaks,"Say I am following a workout routine with approximately 20high intensity exercises (some probably what you define as HIIT and some a bit lower intensity, but still decently high intensity), lasting for about 1 minute each. There is a video of people performing these exercises which takes 30 minutes in total, including some mini breaks here and there.  My question is: does it affect my kcal burn if I add more breaks in between exercises, so the entire series takes maybe 45-50 minutes rather than the original 30? (Will still do all the exercises in full, just add longer breaks in between).  Would doing the 30 minutes of exercises + a 15 min break in the end, equal the same amount of kcal burn as doing the entire thing in 45 min where the breaks are in between exercises?  (The 15 min break was just to get to the same amount of time so that doesn’t skew the answer because the body will be burning some kcal every single minute of the day)  My thought is that pushing your body continuously may raise your heart rate even further resulting in a better workout; but on the other hand, adding a little longer breaks will keep the heart rate up for a longer period of time (unless breaks are long enough to get the heart rate completely down?) "
3498,5x5 Stronglift squats and hip replacement,"Please can someone help me.  I have been looking into the 5x5 stronglifts, and I am keen to get started as I need to get in shape, and I like the look of the results.  I have difficulty doing squats because I was born with half dislocated hip joints.  I have had surgeries to deepen the sockets, and recently found out that I need a hip replacement because the top of my bone 'has died and worn away'.  I can do a few easy ones, but definitely struggle with lunges.  Should i just start with light squats and build up, or should I just avoid these altogether?  I am worried about using heavy weights with squats in case my hip dislocates.  They already click and pop.  Is there anything else I can do to get the same results without doing squats?  I know the squats are an important part of the routine, but want the results and the strength.  Thanks for any advice. "
3499,What is the best way to train at the gym for weight loss purposes?,"I joined a gym 2 months ago, and have exercised almost daily.   In the first 2-3 weeks I went to the gym almost daily exercising for about 45 mins (treadmill, weights etc) but I realised this was not sustainable because I was really exhausted. Also the treadmill hurts my knees. So now I'm working out at the gym 6 times a week with one rest day. However, I am not sure if this is the best way to work out, because after about 2 months, I only lost 4 kg. My target is to lose 10kg.  Typically, my gym session is 15 mins on the Crossover machine ([website]Is this the right approach to lose weight? Should I do more or less cardio / weight lifting? Also, would increasing the workouts to twice a day be better? (30 minutes for each?) I'm female, in my 20s. Any tips on how to structure my workouts? "
3500,What guru is telling people to pull up their toes when they deep squat?,"A month ago, I saw something new.  A guy was doing a deep squat mobility exercise, then he grabbed his toes from the front, and pulled up.  As a consequence of pulling on his toes, his lower back went into a deeper flexion.  Technically speaking, he was making an open chain exercise into a closed chain exercise.  I've been going to gyms for thirty years, and I've never seen anyone do this before.  Then I saw another person doing it, and then another person today, at the same gym.  My conclusion is that some fitness guru, probably on youtube, is telling people this is a good idea.  Does anybody know what fitness guru would be recommending you grab your toes during a deep squat?  Is it a crossfit thing? "
3501,How to hydrate / get hydrated / avoid dehydration?,"I would like to know how to properly get hydrated? I assume it is more than just drinking lots of water. It was suggested here that one should hydrate before, during and after extensive workouts. "
3502,Should beginners be doing Rounded Back Deadlifts in a beginner strength training program?,"Ma Strength posted a video on Facebook   with the following description:     ""To be prepared beforehand for any contingency is the greatest of   virtues.” ---Sun Tzu The Art of War      During maximal attempts, it is very possible for technique to break   down which increases the risk for injury. For example, here we see   Chen Xiaoting (53kg) with a gnarly save at 101kg to win the snatch   gold medal at the 2015 world championships. A sub-optimal pull   resulted in her catching the bar off balance and saving it by rounding   her back and twisting.      Normally this rounded position could result in lower back injury   however Chinese weightlifters insure against this situation by   incorporating rounded back deadlifting because of their ability to   work the erectors through a greater range of motion not covered by   traditional deadlifts and pulls. While one must gradually build up   tolerance for such movements, the end result can prevent injuries when   technique is not perfect. So make sure to train for contingencies and   strengthen the whole body to secure your position.   Beginners following a strength training program, usually don't train under supervision and attempt to lift weights that take their maximal effort, especially when they go beyond their bodyweight, which may break down their technique.   In my case, I was squatting and deadlifting weights 1.2 to 1.5 times my bodyweight with poor form, in StrongLifts 5x5 program. Many times I simply skipped sets just to be safe from injury. I know deloading and working on the form is best way forward. But in spite of conscious efforts to maintain form, there is a strong possibility that in the future, under heavy weights, my technique may break down and I get injured.   Question: Just as a safety measure, should I not prepare my body for it by incorporating Rounded Back Deadlifts? If yes, how to integrate them into StrongLifts program? "
3503,Slimming legs with exercise and diet,"I have thick legs since young (I am 29 now) and play soccer once a week. After my soccer workout I feel my legs get very thick for at least 2 days.  Why is that happening?  I am hoping to make my legs slimmer but sport seems to do the opposite. What is recommended to slim legs and butt? And when it comes to diet, what should I get rid of?  Thanks  Note: I am 5.10 and weight around 182 pounds. My complexion is athletic, barely no belly and I tend to generate muscle easily. My legs are muscled, not fatty, but I don't work out every day, I just play soccer once a week. "

3507,"Running, high HR, VO2max decreases overtime","  Man, 31 years old. I started running five months ago. Because I often finish of my work late and having children, I often run only once on weekend except for last summer vacation while I run about 3 times/week with a total distance of 20km/week.   I stared at 2km/run and gradually increase to 10km/run this month. I often run at pace 8, HR 170 on forest road.  Recently I notice that the VO2 max estimation (by Apple Watch) is quite low and decreases overtime. 31 at the moment. Honestly I feel tired but not really exhausted and I guess I can run longer and I often run at pace 6 for the last 500m.   What can I do to: (1) lower my HR, (2) improve the VO2 max? Should I decrease the distance? Should I run slower? "
3508,Protein supplementation when doing conditioning on caloric deficit,"BACKGROUND  For about four months now I have been on a low carb diet, and during that time I went from 93 to 78kg. I have been lifting some weights (some squats, overhead pushes, bent over rows) at a low rep (6-8) and set (1-2) count, once or twice a week, just for maintaining the existing muscle mass. Im quite sure most of the weight lost was fat. Some calculations made with my (a bit inncaurate) bathroom scales that has BF% measurement, I concluded that around 75% - 80% of the weight lost was fat.  Since my diet was actually based on changing eating choices/patterns, not counting grams and calories, and I mean to keep it, I cant really control accurately my calorie and protein intake. Still, I would be guessing that Im in or near to a caloric deficit. The diet bases on removing sweets, bread, rice, potatoes, pasta and other similar carbohydrate sources and severely limiting fruit. Ocasionally (once a week or two) I allow myself for a carbohydrate spike, eating pretty much anything I want, pizza or chocolate included, just to keep the diet maintainable in the long run.  Now I wanted to begin a training plan around 2 physical and 1 swordsmanship technical workout a week (please see this: Making a training plan for medieval swordsmen / reenactment question, it could use some more good aswers). I will be mostyly focusing on endurance/90sec burst interval adaptation rather than strength during the physical preparation workouts.  Im afraid that my protein intake might bee to small for such a training plan. Most probably I still am in caloric deficit, as my weight isnt yet stable (Fluctuates +- 1kg, with a overal declining tendency, at least up till now). Thats why I was considering including some protein supplementation to make sure i get enough of protein to prevent muscle loss.  QUESTION  While my diet includes quite a lot of eggs, dairy and different forms of meat, I cant be sure if its fit for some additional conditioning training. Is adding some supplementation ""just in case"" a good idea? If so, how much should I add?   Also (I dont want to repeat the background section in another question) can the conditioning training interfere with my body recomposition program, which is based on eating pattern changes? Can this program hinder my efforts to improve my endurance/condition? Please note, im not trying to build muscle mass while losing weight. I want to improve how long I can be active in high intensity 90sec bursts, without hidnering my fat-loss-ability and ruining my existing strength and muscle mass. "
3509,Road bicycles for weight loss,"Due to an injury, I can no longer run, however, I would like to use my road bicycles to lose weight.  Assuming I have the discipline, and I use a trainer for the training sessions, What type of sessions should i have?  High cadence? ~110+?  Distance?  Time based?  Should I aim for a certain Heart Rate Zone? "
3510,How often should one take breaks when lifting weights for muscle size gain?,"All the literature seems to suggest I should do between 4 to 5 sets of bench presses, but after my third set or so, I start to feel very exhausted, often to the point where I couldn't even complete a single rep if I tried.  (This actually holds for all compound lifts, not just bench.)  I find myself taking 30 second breaks at first, then 90 second, then sitting for 5 minutes waiting to get my breath back, procrastinating the next set, and getting nothing done.  How often is it appropriate to take a break while lifting, and how long?  If I could take 5 to 10 minute breaks between each set (even if I did so by lifting other muscle groups) I could definitely meet the 5 sets goal.  But would that negate the effect of doing 5 sets?  Does letting your muscles recuperate between sets defeat the purpose? "
3511,core strengthening for weak lower back,"I have a weak L3 (the 3rd disc up from my pelvis) - that is, it is given to pressing against the nerve, causing discomfort (no actual pain, as yet) locally and, when I don't pay attention for long periods, further across the muscles in my back.  This has caused me to significantly reduce weight carrying and my physiotherapist has advised me with a couple of exercises to strengthen my ""core"".  Are there any exercises this community can recommend which I can use to strengthen the muscles around the lower back and ""core"" in general which will aid in supporting the problem area and (specifically) avoid putting undue load/stress on it?  Given my limited physiology knowledge, this supplemental question would seem to appropriate: Are the following good/advisable ""core"" strengthening exercises...   dead lifting plank back curl   I have consulted my GP and my physical therapist and will continue to do so. I ask here a knowledgeable and passionate community their advice and experience while not implying that I would discard input from medical professionals.  EDIT: The exercises I’ve been given are...   The bridge Curl Up (opposite of the curl down)  "
3512,What are the effects of improving physical health on mental health?,It has been three weeks since I started doing cardio exercises and I feel calm and relaxed. Is it because of the exercises? How does exercise improve mental health? 
3513,Post workout supplements?,"I have moved to a different city and joined the gym yesterday, last night my workout consisted of 15 minutes running on the treadmill at 10 mph with a 3% incline and 3 sets of leg presses, 35 repetitions per set at 110lbs where 1 set is fast push out and slow in (for power). I forgot to add that the rest time in between each set is 15 seconds, I wanted to max out my heart rate, it worked, I could hear it more than the music playing.  now the thing is I am at work and my eyes are drooping...I haven't had nutrition after working out, I have had a lot of water. But for breakfast I had oats and that is about it.  these are my questions at the moment, sorry if I have bunched too many in to one:   Should I take things like Coconut water post workout for electrolyte replenishment? Can I take those electrolyte supplements during my workout? because I sweat very heavily and loose a lot during my workout. Should I save taking things like protein supplements for the next morning or take them sometime after my workout? What do I immediately need replenishing after my workout to lower fatigue, water being the obvious and minerals etc.. I know the body acts as a sponge for sometime after working out so it is better during that time to take things like protein, but I would really like to stop/lower my fatigue.   I sleep for 6 hours a day, usually no more and definitely no less.  I have read articles on these questions, but here I can describe my workouts and get a more suitable answer, thank you all in advance for your help. "
3514,Method of exercising,What is the difference between the normal weight training motions (e.g. bench press lifting it up and down) and holding a weight at a certain point (e.g. holding a weight in the middle of a press for a long amount of time)? Why is the first more effective? Does the second have any specific benefits that you could elaborate on? 
3515,Heart Rate for a Half Marathon,"I've just completed the Newport Half Marathon and had an pretty steady heart rate of 88% of my max.  My details are here.  Is this good?  Generally speaking, what should the heart rate be for a half marathon? "
3516,Is there a good way to convert a speed number on an eliptical to mph?,What is the meaning of the speed indication on an elliptical?  It ranges up to about  9 or 10 at what is a high speed run for me.  Is there an approximate conversion to mph? 
3517,What assistance to 5/3/1 for beginner,"After not training for a couple of years I am just starting again, and decided to use the 5/3/1 template. I am pretty much set on using 5/3/1 but if you can make a (very) good case for another program (and it isn't Starting Strength/Stronglifts) I will consider it.   My short-term goal is to lose fat, I am currently a 235lbs bag of lard (well, there is still some muscle there). And my long-term goal is to be strong while looking good doing it.  Since I am very limited in time, I opted for a 2 day/week split. One day is Squat/Bench, the other is Deadlift/Press.  For assistance I add 5x10 dumbbell rows on day 1, and heavy farmers walks on day 2.  My question is: are these assistance exercises a good complement? Or should I substitute for different ones? Or should I maybe add more? Time is very much a constraint, so I would prefer to stick to 1 assistance exercise. But if you can make a good case for adding another I will definitely consider.  And another thing: when do you change up assistance exercises? I was planning to change every 2/3 cycles. "
3518,Ensuring muscle isolation when training alone,"I've found that trainers or other experienced body builders are great to work out with because they can help with form and method. One of the biggest issues I have is muscle isolation, meaning that while trying to workout a certain muscle group, I actually work out another.  Example: Tricep dips, I end up extending out too far and end up working my shoulders instead of my triceps. I realized this after watching training videos. But I never felt like it was working my shoulders so I never thought about it.  My question is, how can a person who is training alone help to realize when they are not isolating the target muscle group and prevent doing so?   Watching videos is a great way to get the form right but since no one is there watching me, what can I do to make sure my form is correct and that I'm isolating the target muscle group? "
3519,How to interpret running metrics,"How do I usefully interpret running metrics?  I haven't been running for long.

What is the key elements to look for in these metrics? "
3520,How do the disabled swim? How do they use their legs?,"I'm disabled, not like Roy from the IT crowd :) I can walk on crutches or walker, and I can swim for few minutes. I realize that kicking my legs is what makes me float, using my arms is just to move around.  I can swim on my back but it's boring :) besides, I still need to use my legs at some point, and it feels awkward :) I asked my friend who has the same physical condition, he told me that he use life jacket! That's not the answer I wanted to hear! I don't want to buy anything, I could, but that's not the point.  I keep  seeing people with no legs on youtube swimming, how do they do it? My legs gets tired if I kick for so long.  So how to swim using minimum effort with my legs? do they use a technique that I don't know? "
3521,Change in eating habits from Half Marathon to 6 mile,For a half marathon I spent the week before carb loading and hydrating.  I'm running a 6 mile soon and would like some 5Km races too.  How should I change my diet for different length races?  Should terrain affect my diet?  Roar running requires less raw power then undulating gress and mud.  Thanks  Dave 
3522,Can anyone recommend science-based skeptical literature or media about exercise?,"I'm searching around for answers to various fitness questions as I try to figure out how to incorporate exercise into my life, but I grow frustrated with all the fads, conjectures and ideologies out there. Can anyone suggest some sourced, critical information out there about fitness and exercise? It would be great if it also fact-checked many of the ideas out there...for example, whether compound exercises improve functional fitness better than isolation exercises, or if there really is a difference between training for size compared to training for strength? While a lot of the ideas make sense, I want to know how well they've been tested. I think a lot of the information out there may be based on limited scientific data and then extrapolated audaciously (or seems to the few times I had the time to look for supporting studies). There also seem to be ""cults of personality"" out there, like Pavel (with the kettle bells), who seem to provide fine information on a practical basis, but these personalities also seem to have a power to bless a conjecture as true in the ""fitness world"" without going through the scientific process. Additionally, fitness seems to go through as many fads and trends as nutritional information. For instance, there is HIIT, functional fitness, cross-training (Crossfit), core training, Olympic lifts, yoga, pilattes, stability exercises, and I'm just mentioning some of the things that seem to make more sense to me.  Anyway, the point is that perhaps too much searching on the web and reading lame pop fitness books has filled my head with too many ideas that I now question. Can anyone recommend anything that will help me weed out all this cruft? "
3523,Is circuit training superior to conventional weight training?,"I know that there have been studies that show that more rest between sets, given the same volume, leads to significantly more gains, at the expense of more time in the gym, so circuit training would seem like the logical thing to explore.  By circuit training, I mean doing exercises in the order of     A B C D A B C D A B C D   instead of     A A A B B B C C C D D D   Two variants of the question:  Is circuit training superior (for hypertrophy / strength / muscle endurance) given  (a) the same time in the gym and the same volume (so the same rest between sets)  or  (b) the same volume, but less time?  Have there been studies done on this? "
3524,How can I gain weight and muscle weight?,"I'm a 15 year old teenager, I am terribly underweighted due tot he fact when I was smaller I had nutrition issues (Skipping breakfast on most days, not eating consistent food, eating junk food, etc). Since last year I've started to recover and I've tried to regain good nutrition habbits. I've started eating breakfast each day at specific hours (This applies to dinner, lunch too) and eating snacks between them sometimes. I eat very consistently. For example one of my days menu is like this: 2 slices of toast with butter on it and a mug of milk, a few nuts an hour later, a plate of fried potatoes with steak for lunch, corn-meal with  cottage cheese for dinner, and always eating something on bread after dinner.  I also love riding bikes, I have a bike which I ride every day during summer mornings for about 30 minutes or an hour. I do push-ups in the morning after I wake up, however all this isn't helping by much.  My current weight is pretty drastical, I admit, it's actually terrible: 50 kgs on 1.84m height at 15 years. Yes, it's a terrible weight, and I'm supposed to have about 65-73 kgs at this height and age.  However with all this workout, school, push-ups, eating proper meals at proper times every day has only helped me gain 3 kgs. I started at 46-47 kgs and now I have 50. It feels terrible to be this skinny and everyone is telling me to ""bundle up"".  My question is, what advices can you give me? Am I doing something wrong? My aim is 60 kgs. 70 kgs would be ideal. What should I do? Should I eat more? Should I exercise less? Should I eat more consistently?  Please share your advices as to how I could gain weight and how I could gain some muscle mass. "
3525,Keeping belly area taut a good practice?,"Will keeping my belly ""tucked in"" or taut help strengthen my abdominal muscles? Are there any negative sides to doing this? I used to do this in high school but gave up doing it when I started working and the sedentary life kicked in. "
3526,Hallucinating Smells,"I've been going to various gyms in the past 4 years doing mostly cardio (treadmill &amp; elliptical) and sometimes free-weights. There have been many varying conditions afterward, such as driving home and walking home, being in Texas or Oregon, etc. Yet the one common denominator has been that, maybe half the time, my nose starts smelling strange smells in the 20 or 30 minutes after a workout.  The smells are of a metallic or sour odor. They are all bad smells, but not in a body odor sort of way. My wife is almost always with me and never understands what I'm talking about. I'll smell it when I get home, in a new house that otherwise never smells bad. The only other possible link is that I feel I'm more likely to hallucinate smells if I pushed myself extra hard at the gym.  Anyone else experience this? Any idea of a cause? "
3527,Can fruits replace vegetables?,"I have a very simple question: Can you replace vegetables with fruits in your diet? As in, eat no vegetables instead eat lots of fruit?

I was wondering if I could do my 3 day routine on Monday, Wednesday and Friday while having some full body workouts on Tuesdays and Thursdays without involving any lifting, and focus more on reps and body-weight exercises. Is this advisable? if so, I read swimming is one the best full body exercises, but I have no access to a pool. What would be some replacements for it?  "

3534,Can breathing more often over the course of the day contribute to weight loss?,"related to an older question here: If I were to weigh all the food and water I take in, and weigh all of the human waste I produced could that be used to determine weight gain or loss?  the tl;dr of that article is that we lose a ton of weight exhaling carbon dioxide each day.  my question: if you were to make a conscious effort to breathe more often while you are awake, would it speed up the production of carbon dioxide and thus make you lose weight faster?  I know breathing rate generally increases during exercise as blood flow increases, which might contribute to weight loss during exercise, but would the opposite also be true where breathing faster increases blood flow?  also does anyone know any possible consequences this could have on the body?  sorry if this idea is super far out in left field, I'm a bit new to the fitness field, and I'm trying to explore a bit to get my bearings, and this is a thought that came to mind. "
3535,"Should standard, non-rehabilitation exercise routines target smaller individual muscles?","Looking at the list of exercises on exrx.net, I see a good deal of them recommending exercises to target muscles that most fitness sites seem to completely overlook. For example, there are pages with exercises for:   Subscapularis Wrist flexors, extenders, pronators, supinators Supraspinatus Neck   With the exception of neck exercises, I haven't seen the others on any recommended fitness routines. Should these muscles be exercised as part of a non-rehabilitation regime for preventive purposes? Or would they be adequately worked out by other compound exercises? "
3536,Benefits of increasing treadmill elevation while running?,"Last week I was able to run on a treadmill for 2 miles at a constant speed of 6.0 (which is a 10 minute mile pace) at an avg elevation of 3 (I started at 4 and dropped as I got more and and more fatigued).   Today I was able to run 2 miles at constant 6.0 and avg 4.0 (I started at 4.0 and kept at 4.0 elevation).   So that means all else constant (i.e. same amount of flexibility, strength and cardio vascular endurance) that I gained only muscular endurance (in my quads) right?   More importantly I pose this question as when it comes to running I only am aware of runners who wish to increase their speed or distance. Do runners ever try to specifically increase their incline/vertical distance? Is there any particular reason or benefit for this?   The only reason that comes to mind is if someone is trying to jog up a large hill or mountain (that's not too steep).  Note: I added cycling as a tag as I'm equally interested and the question is identical.  Normally cyclist try to increase speed or distance.  Any reason why a cyclist would specifically train for incline (e.g. on a machine a cyclist would up the gear but keep pace and distance fixed).  And would there even be any difference or is the answer to cyclist increasing elevation identical to runner increasing elevation.  I'm interested in both as I like to use the treadmill and machine bicycle as well, although more-so I use the treadmill. "
3537,Should I drop my deadlift to 190# while switching to StrongLifts if I can already deadlift 425# x1?,I've seen a ton of variations of the question but never found one that answered my question. I understand why only one set of dead lifts because of the squats. My question is why is the weight on the deadlift so low? I've worked up to 425lb 1RM on my dead lift and now it has me starting out at 190lbs x5 on the first week and by week 12 I'm not even at my 5RM. Now I love deadlifts and want to keep my 425 1RM up but don't think I'll be able to with this program.   But I digress. My question is why such a drop in weight on the DL? 
3538,Is high protein intake necessary for building strength when you don't want to add muscle?,"I want to maintain my bodyweight but increase my performance on exercises like pull-ups and skater squats. Assume that I find ways to create progressive overload that stimulates the muscles to improve.   When eating a maintenance diet, does the proportion of protein matter for the adaptations the body does to get stronger? Is high protein needed to build the new nerve cells or muscle nuclei the body creates when it becomes stronger without adding muscle? "

3540,Can sideways weightlifting be dangerous?,"I used to weight lifts sideways, which means I bent sideways while carrying a dumbbell in both of my hands. Naturally this created tension in both sides of my waist, and helped developed muscles there, but at the same time it created a temporary S-shape at the lower back.   Can this cause scoliosis by any chance?  PS In terms of physical injury, does the absence of pain or other symptoms able to be sensed, indicate the absence of injury? "

3542,Started working out -- Gaining weight?,"a Month ago I've started working out. 5 times a week. Each session: 25 min weights, 25 min cardio (running/fast walking in 5 min intervals).  I feel leaner. I definitely see a ""change"" in slightly beefier muscles (even after one month), But I gained 10 pounds!  How can that be? I'm still considered overweight. 6ft over 215 pounds. I don't eat flour. Cut back on sugars. Lots of Proteins. Yes, still a diet soda addict, but how can I work out so much and still gain weight without any change in waist size? "
3543,What's the best way for me to start weightlifting?,"I've always wanted to lift weights and honestly have no idea where to begin.   How do I get started? Do I need to join a gym? find a personal trainer? buy a book and weights? find a friend who weightlifts? What's the best way for me to get involved in the weightlifting community and start lifting weights myself?  Is this something I can do by myself (at home), or is it a good idea for me to train with others (at a gym or club)?  Goal details: My goal is mainly to gain muscle. I've been focusing on cardio a lot recently (running, zumba), and have lost quite a bit of weight from eating healthily. Now I'd like to define my muscles a bit more and get stronger (especially upper body). "

I am not sure though if it is due to the supplements or not.  I will try cutting back on those supplements and see what happens, but generally speaking, can certain supplements, such as L-Glutamine, cause insomnia? "
3545,My cardio class burns my muscle?,"I decided that I want to change my body completely, my weight is 167.5 pounds and my height is 1.65 meters. I follow a diet and I go to the gym in the night.   I have been going to the gym since two months and I lost 7.4 pounds, my routine is of 2 hours, in a hour I work with weights and in the other hour I take a class in the scaler-machine of Monday to Friday, I consider the last one like a cardio class:   Monday: leg Thuesday: Back and Biceps Wednesday: Chest and Triceps Thursday: leg Friday: Abs Saturday: I take a break Sunday: I go out in my bicicle for a hour.   The point is that I want to burn fat, but also I want to win muscle, in the beginning this happened without problems, my muscle was increasing very good. But now I can´t see the muscle increase, I only see that my fat is going down.  Since 3 weeks ago I take the cardio class with another girl, she is very intense, to the end of the class my clothes ends completely wet, and I like it.  My question is: Does the cardio class that I take burns my muscle that I win in the first hour? Should I increase protein consumption to increase my muscle? I don't want to leave my cardio class.  Regards. "
3546,Interval versus Continuous training for weight loss,"My wife has been trying to get me to do interval training (e.g. bike hard for 30s and then take it easy for 4-5 mins) instead of ride a stationary bike, mainly so she can be outside and we can interact more instead of be on separate machines at the gym (which she finds tedious).  My routine is normally to ride a stationary bike for 30 minutes and keep my heart rate over 160 the entire time (at least, once I get there from whatever my starting heart rate is).  We've gone for a ride and I watch my heartrate and it barely gets to 135 when I push it (usually leaving her behind and then wait for her to catch up).  We rode for about an hour or so.  I didn't get nearly as sweaty as I do on the stationary bike.  I feel like this isn't nearly as effective as my usual stationary bike routine.  How can I compare these 2 methods?  How can I tell if I'm getting as good of a workout to achieve my weight loss goals?  I keep nagging her to go to the gym with me and she keeps wanting to run/walk on a trail in the forest or bike on a trail and I just simply feel like it's not a good workout. "
3547,What's the relationship between gaining muscle mass and strength? How do I increase in strength without increasing in mass?,"This question is a follow on from [website]I assumed that as I get stronger, my muscles will get bigger, but it seems that this is not a strictly linear relationship, which indicates that I can increase the amount my muscles can do without increasing their size, (they become more efficient?).  So my question is twofold:   How are muscle mass and strength related? What causes an increase in strength but not mass? What are the types of exercises that increase strength but not mass?   I would think that there are some limitations to muscle mass vs strength, that is, that the muscle can reach a maximum efficiency where it has to increase in size before it can be stronger. I'm looking for answers where the muscle hasn't reached this stage yet (and so there is room for increasing in strength or mass).  My goals: I'd like to increase the amount my muscles can do (their strength) rather then increase their mass at least initially.  Assumptions: I'm using the words size and mass interchangeably, even though they strictly aren't the same thing. "
3548,Are barefoot shoes suitable for multi-terrain obstacle courses?,"I'm planning on doing the Warrior Dash later this year. It is a 3.2 mile (5K) race course through mountainous terrain, mud, and water. In addition, there will also be obstacles along the way such as:   barricades barbed wire fire scrap yard wreckage (an image shows tires and cars) wooden structures (giant see-saws, walls)   Since I haven't worn a ""normal"" pair of athletic sneakers in over four years, I plan on getting something that is similar to what I wear for martial arts. My kung fu shoes are flat-soled and have little cushioning. My style is also a Northern (China) one which has many acrobatic and leg techniques. My body is comfortable handling the impact on my feet and legs. Given my constant training schedule and how accustomed I am to wearing my current type of shoe, a barefoot shoe seems like a natural transition that I think would be good for me.  I have been looking at various barefoot shoes which are separated into specific fitness activities like running, water, and trekking. Since this event is mostly running, I'm tempted to buy barefoot running shoes over ones that are meant for hiking or trails.  Are barefoot shoes good for these type of courses? If so, are there traits of one model of shoe that are advantageous over another? If barefoot shoes wouldn't be good for this type of activity, why would it not be suitable for muddy obstacle courses? "
3549,Which gait is more healthy?,"I have heard from friends, whose source is unknown to me, that it is healthier to walk by setting your toes upon the ground before your heel, but I always step on my heel first, unless I am carrying something heavy or running. It seems to me that it is more natural to step on your heel first.   I have also heard it stated, much more often, that it is healthier to have toes pointed in (slightly, not unnaturally) or straight than pointed out, and even that you are likely to have leg problems if you always walk with them pointed outwards. In fact, because of peer pressure and its effects, it was a ""thing"" for a while that we were constantly aware of and criticizing each other's gait, having a generally snobbish regard for those whose feet pointed outwards at all. We have matured since then, but ever since, I have wondered if any of it is really true.   Question 1: Heel first vs. toes first -- Which, if either, is healthier, and do either effect your later years if exercised daily?  Question 2: Toes pointed in or out -- Which, if either, is healthier, and do either effect your later years if exercised daily? "
3550,How to select running shoes for performance?,"For the exercise running shoe illiterate, there are so many different varieties of exercise running shoes and so many different brand choices that it becomes overwhelming when looking for the right fit. Even reading online is tricky because what may be sound advice, easily gets lost in: the vast amount of information, scheming marketing articles, hype for new shoes, and the very large number running shoe choices.  So here I am wondering if you can help me solve this riddle, how can I objectively choose a good running shoe?  This question aims to answer:   What type of running shoes exist, so that I may understand what I am looking at and how to select a shoe based on what it offers. How do you identify the superior shoe based on their longevity, quality, brand trust, and other factors? What else should I need to know that is not included here?   Edit: If it matters to you, here are my personal goals:   To run distances up to 10 miles, I currently run 3 miles. To have the shoe reflect support during runs, whether long or short. I would prefer them not to be barefoot, and to be on the lighter side vs the heavy side (although feel free to slap my hand show me why). I am 6'4"" if that matters, I am in my target BMI and I have no medical issues/orthopedic necessities. I plan to run at most 3 times a week (both long and short runs). I will run on flat, solid terrain. I do wonder if trail shoes are superior to shoes for flat surfaces, and whether or not they will work on flat surfaces too.  "
3551,Increased irritability with ultra-low body fat?,"Yesterday, reading in my newspaper I discovered an interview with a professional boxer (at the end of his career). He said preparing for an upcoming fight has been really hard... getting body weight down and all that.  What caused my surprise was another remark from the boxer. When he is well-trained, low weight, he has a really low body fat values of, say, 5%, but he does not really like this. He said that during this time, he is easily irritated, exhibits uncontrolled anger and tends to be a more unloveable person.  So is this an individual trait or can this be generalized? So getting low body fat could have undesirable effects on the temper or mental state of the athlete? Is there a medical explanation for this? How would a sports-psychologist comment on that? "
3552,Optimal volume (sets/reps) per week?,"After training for about a year now, I am noticing I gained some muscle (not sure how much, but I'd say under 5kg/10lbs). So I would not say I am a beginner, but I'd like to add on at least 5/10lbs of muscle.  I go about 3-4 times per week to the gym, a session for every major muscle group (back, chest, legs and a session for all the rest). So far I am doing about 20 sets per major muscle groups, 8-10 for the smaller groups.   Recently I stumbled over a bunch of internet resources that suggest maybe going for less volume, and when I googled ""optimal number of sets per muscle group per week"" I found articles which point to 60-120 reps/week for large muscles and 30-60 reps/week for smaller ones. Considering that my sets are usually 8-12 reps (15-20 sometimes), I am doing around 20*10 = 200 reps/weeks for the major muscles and 8*10=80 reps/week for smaller ones. It looks excessive, but it's about one solid hour of workout where I rest very little (no more than a minute) betweek sets.   My question is very simple: what is the optimal number of sets/reps per week to maximize muscle gain (knowing that I am taking enough proteins) ? Is there anything on the scientific litterature to indicate or estimate that number ? What's your number from practices and what's your balance of intensity (weight) and volume (set-rep quantity) for that number ?  Thanks. "
3553,How to bring Cholesterol down with workouts,"I did a blood test and my cholesterol level was 202mg/dL from 200.  I am little above normal.  Everyday, I eat meals that include cholesterol (3 meals.)  My age is 23, my height is 1.79m and weight is 68kg. Now, I every day walk at least 2 hours.  Yesterday, I walked more than 4 hours.  Once a week I go for football for two hours.  Also, I do my whole body workouts.  I don't eat anything that has sugar.  Now, is this ""program"" good to bring down cholesterol levels?  What workouts will give good results? "
3554,What's the point of the weekly 2-day break in Starting Strength's programming? Can a novice just skip that?,"Starting Strength prescribes two daily lifting schedules (A and B), to be performed alternately on 3 non-consecutive days per week.  That means something like this:            S M T W T F S          ------------- week 1     A   B   A week 2     B   A   B week 3     A   B   A   This will leave a 2-day break at some point each week (this is the case in any arrangement of 3 non-consecutive days per week).  For a novice, I doubt I'm strong enough yet to lift enough weight to require the extra rest each week. Is there a benefit to the 2-day break other than recovery? If I recover sufficiently, can I skip that 2-day break? What's wrong with just lifting every second day for the first little while?            S M T W T F S          ------------- week 1     A   B   A week 2   B   A   B   A week 3     B   A   B   This can only last so long anyway, since I'll be adding in some team practices relatively soon and will drop to two days a week of lifting. "
3555,Running in boots comfortably down mountain trails,"Once a week, I run down a small mountain (3 km, 450 m denivelation). 1/3 is asphalt, but 2/3 of it is a trail consisting of rocks and roots poking through mud, covered with dead leaves and the occasional loose stone. The surface is also wet or frosted depending on the weather. I don't jog slowly, I alternate sprinting and quick walking (for when I am out of breath). My gait doesn't help: I tend to land hard on the heel, which is cumbersome downhill.   If I try doing it in running shoes, I'll soon break an ankle. So I'm doing it in hiking boots.   While the hiking boots bear weight well and don't slip, they are still not optimal for running. Is there a way to make it easier on my feet? Maybe some kind of inlays? Something to correct for my overpronation?  "

3557,amount of pounds resistance bands represent,"I just bought a set of 3 resistance bands: yellow 5#, green 15#, &amp; blue 15#. I'm wondering is this the amount of pounds they represent when fully stretched? I saw another post and someone commented about how they saw a range per band and someone else explained it and it made sense-- Ex: red band is 50-100 lbs and they said at the start of stretch it is about 50 lbs, midway about 75 lbs and fully stretched its about 100 lbs, which totally made sense, but the ones I bought did not have a range so I'm wondering what y'alls thoughts are?   Thanks in advance! "

3559,"Patello-femoral Pain Syndrome in methods such as X-ray, MRI or CT?","Medical term:  Patello-femoral Pain Syndrome (aka runner knee).  I am trying to find more scientific description about the syndrome, not just pain but what is it actually? How can a doctor see it from an image or images?  According to my doctor, my knee looks ok in x-tray images but having now 3 week rest -- I can still feel such chronic ""runner pain"". According to this source, runner knee can be diagnosed in a number of ways:     After a physical exam, a doctor can diagnose runner's knee via an   X-ray, MRI, or CT (computed tomography) scan.   Now what is the difference between the methods and is there a reason to get MRI or CT? I am now going to meet ortologist but I am unsure of this, this is quite generalized issue in itself! Is there any objective way to say whether person X has runner knee or not? Even I am  unsure of this, I initially thought that it is more my right knee but I am getting similar pain in the left knee now while right resting. I have been very proactive with this because I do not want it to get any worse.  Some suggestion about the medical scans appreciated, anyone with similar situation? My friend had similar case and he insisted on some ""deep scan"" (x-tray did not work but the deep scan identified the runner knee), now I have no idea what this ""deep scan"" actually is.   Some medical experts such as ortologists around to identify runner knee with different methods? Some objectivity to this issue would be highly appreciated.

3561,Bouldering vs Rock Climbing,"I have recently enrolled myself into a rock climbing gym here at Sydney. I liked the idea of climbing but did not ever got the chance till date.   Well, my question is: what to do first, Bouldering or Rock Climbing?  Initially I never had a tad idea regarding bouldering, but here at the climbfit gym the mentors asked me to opt for bouldering sessions as it will lay down the foundation. I went for an indoor rock climbing but now I am unsure.  Anyone here can shed some light? "
3562,Why is there an emphasis on consuming protein for muscle repair and gain?,"I've heard it explained before but I still don't understand why there is such an emphasis on consuming lots of protein. My trainers say I should consume 1 gram of protein per body weight (and then some) but they really never told me why.  Then what are the differences between the various proteins out there, like whey and beef isolates? Also, why aren't protein shakes enough to consume the required protein? "

3564,Why don't people get fatter even faster than they do?,"Americans are overeating by at least 300 kcal/day on average, according to some sources:     Twenty-five years ago, the average American consumed about 1,850   calories each day. Since then, our daily diet has grown by 304   calories (roughly the equivalent of two cans of soda). That's   theoretically enough to add an extra 31 pounds to each person every   year.   (Since 25 years ago, they were grossly overeating too, I'd guess this number is much higher, but let's use this conservative estimate)    Why aren't Americans gaining 31lb per year (or much more)?  Instead, the average person only gains about 2lb per year in his or her 20s and 30s. Why?    Here's why @C.Lange's ""equilibrium"" hypothesis does not hold (too long for a comment)  Consider his example:  Random statistic: Male, 30, 6', 200 lb, Sedentary, 15% BF (i.e. 30 lb fat to start).  200 lb @ BF 15% = 2443 kcal 300 lb @ BF 35% ((30 + 75)/300)*100 = 2737 kcal (+294 kcal) 400 lb @ BF 45% ((30 + 150)/400)*100 = 3031 kcal (+294 kcal) 500 lb @ BF 51% ((30 + 225)/400)*100 = 3325 kcal (+294 kcal)   If this person eats at a 300 kcal/day surplus, his equilibrium weight is 300lb, and the initial weight gain (31lb/year) is mostly unaffected by the hypothetical increases in TDEE down the road.  (If my estimate that Americans are overeating by 1000 kcal/day is right, then this person should balloon from 200 to 500lb)  But we don't see this happening. People eat the standard American diet of pizza and donuts, gain weight, but they do it slowly. "
3565,What would I need to track fitness effort?,"What, in addition to an Android device with GPS, would I need to track fitness effort?  I am thinking of perhaps something like a Fitbit, or can the Android do the same?  Also probably a hearth rate monitor.  I have had a Polar monitors in the past, but I think the way it worked didn't really fit my purpose.  What I want to track is to a great extent daily activities like walking and biking, and fitness activities like Pilates or dancing, which are not primarily aerobic.   One activity is longer walks/hikes, it is also a goal to to even harder ones well. "
3566,Length recommendation of safety spotters for a home gym,When planning my new home gym I stumbled over the question of how long safety spotters should be. For example the kingsbox royal series seems to be a reasonable option to me but has only 51 cm safety spotters. I am not sure if this is enough.   So is there any rule of what is a good length of safety spotters and why?  
3567,"How to choose ""Neutral shoes"" for long distance endurance running?","This answer here mention that ""neutral shoes"" are better for long distance running. I have used Adidas Supernova for a very long time with inversion support (ofc changed them every year or so, tried other but always gone back to them -- the name may have changed but they have the inversion -support thing and wide thing in the front of the shoes, basically the reason I like them). Now I have tried longer distance running lasting hours and I feel that the Supernovas are not good for them, they make my outer part of the foot hurting -- to the unacceptable level of pain. So I am now looking for some neutral shoes. It is surely harder to test ""neutral shoes"" for long distance running because one should buy them all to trial with them! Some generic hints or instructions? I run on tarmac.  ""neutral shoes""? Perhaps, this is an area of research, interesting what people will come up with ""neutral shoes"". Are they no-inversion-supported shoes, vibram-style barefoot shoes, Nike Free shoes or something else? At least, this trend is now even in cheaper shops like here, will update when I know more about the issue. "
3568,What are the principles for a correct headstand / sinsasana?,"I have started including daily headstand in the morning (sinsasana). It feels like the most relaxing posture I have ever experienced.  But, from time to time, (too often for my taste), I do feel something in the neck that annoys me, almost the beginning of a pain.   I suppose it is a question of equilibrium and that my weight is not well spread upon my head, and my hands.  As I have no yoga instructor, I'm wondering:   What are the principles for a correct headstand ? How to avoid possibles injuries ? When to know that the headstand is good ?   For the moment I cannot stand longer than 3 minutes, I do 1-2 minutes most of the time. I have been told one can safely do 10 to 15 minutes. But I would prefer not to take bad habits in this posture.   Edit: as stressed in one of the answer below:   it is not a good practice to be timing the headstand, we should listen to our body.  "
3569,"Adding Muscle Mass using ""NO LOAD"" resistance training","Updated : [website]Bret gets it. LOL  Regarding the small sample size. You do realize how common studies of less than 20 people are?  Large RTC studies are obvious the best but unless big pharma's backing you it's tough to find the funding.  Just saw this part ""Even if you do completely unloaded bicep curls you will still stimulate red muscle fibers.""     Type I - Muscle Fibers are Red due to myoglobin content / O2.    Type IIa (are    Red / Pink) Type IIx are (Pale / Whitish) as they are glycolytic.      It is well known, that slightly loaded work stimulates the growths of red muscle fibers and myogenesis.      I may be wrong but I believe Type I changes seen are more vascular and metabolically related.  Do you have a study showing hypertrophy occurs in Type I fibers?  I know that myofibrils / the overall number of sarcomeres increase with resistance training.   You're basically illustrating by accident why I find this study so interesting.  What is inducing the hypertrophy? Are the IIx and IIa saying contacted for a sustained period?  How?  Basically how are you getting to threshold to depolarize your largest muscle fibers?  Sustained flexion I would think would have the opposite effect vs a normal isotonic concentric contraction.  What's triggering this?    Wow didn't expect to find this.  A study released less than a year ago compared left vs right arm muscle mass changes with the following setup     One arm no load (but maximally flexing muscle)  Other arm high load training (70% 1RM)    After 18 sessions they found:    Increased muscle mass on both sides (with slightly greater gains on the heavy load side)  In a way it actually makes sense:  As muscle tension increases so does recruitment (or the number of active motor units)    Size Principle: Motor Units are activated from smallest to largest Motor Unit: Consists of a single motor neuron and all the fibers it innervates Recruitment: The number of motor units that are active.       Anyone every seen a similar study? How would you explain the   hypertrophy with a load?  Do any hormonal changes occur by just   flexing?

3570,Army Run - Train for long and heavy run,"How can I train to run/jog/march while carrying 50 to 100 pounds? Such as training to do the Fan Dance (SAS March) Fan Dance  On my first attempt to train, I put two 10 pounds ankle weights and some heavy books in a backpack (totaling about 25 pounds), when running I had pain in the rhomboideus major area.  The next day I ran without the backpack and I felt light as feather, but the back pain worried me.  How can I increase weight without harming my back? The backpack does not bounce and I always make sure to stretch, is there any secret in the army to running/jogging with heavy weights?  The weather where I train is uneven, cold and snowy. I use a 5.11 Rush 24 backpack and Blackhawk boots.

3571,Accuracy of calorie measurements,"When I use a Concept2 indoor rower, I also start a Workout on my Apple Watch.  Both devices have a heart rate monitor, and both are measuring my calories.  Yet there is a wide difference between the two, and I wonder why it is so large.  (I understand that Apple Watch's measurement is a rough approximation, but is there more to it?)  Here are three workouts I did today:  Workout                Rower     Watch                            % diff 20 min steady / HIIT   259 cal   144 cal active / 173 cal total   80%  /50% 35 min HIIT            448 cal   267 cal active / 320 cal total   68% / 40% 10 min low intensity   111 cal   65 cal active / 80 cal total     71% / 39%   My thinking is that the rower is the ultimate authority on calories -- it is an ergometer, designed to accurately measure work, which means energy, which means calories.  So, is the Apple Watch simply wildly inaccurate, or are the two devices measuring different things under the umbrella of calories? "
3572,Is it effective to do the same workout the same day with hours in between?,"So I have been doing an intense workout in the afternoon, which involves the triceps and the shoulders. I have done this workout to failure for about an hour, until I couldn't do any more reps. Approximately 5-6 hours later, I tried doing the same workout and I notice that I don't struggle and do it quite easily. Does this mean that I should continue going? Is it effective to do the same workout to train the same muscles a couple of hours later, if it goes well? Are there any downsides to this? I suppose this gives you the maximum hypertrophy right? "
3573,How can I listen to music while running?,"I want to listen to music while running, but I have a hard time finding a good way to do so.  My phone is quite big, and my watch is a standard running watch, not a smart watch. I live in a place with lots of rain, so the equipment must be water resistant.  I'm guessing wireless earbuds, but how can I bring the music with me?  Note: I'm not asking for product recommendations, but rather ""solution recommendations"". I.e. what sort of product(s) should I buy? "
3574,Heel height in weightlifting shoes,"I was looking at a couple of weightlifting shoes. One pair had a 0.5 inch (~1.27 cm) raised heel and the other had a 1 inch (~3.54 cm) raised heel. They were both from the same company and both cost exactly the same. From what I can tell, this was the only thing different between them structure wise.  All things being equal, what difference would such a small variation of the heel have? Why would someone choose a lower raised heel over the higher one and vice versa? How would different heel height effect this squat, clean, and snatch if at all?  The current shoes I use have a 1 inch raised heels. I have to admit I did not consider height variation when purchasing them. "
3575,Is it feasible to train for a marathon in 15 weeks? I've just run a 1:55 half-marathon with no training,"I signed up for a half marathon (there were half + full marathon races for the same event), taking place in April '16, and started training last week (Around 13 December). I'm not a regular runner (or exerciser in general), but I think I'm naturally physically inclined towards cardio activities. [Early 20s, male, 60-70kg, 170-180cm.]  As part of some 'beginner to half marathon' schedule I'm following, I went for few 3milers throughout the week, and then yesterday went for a 5 miler.   But I ended up running a full 13.2mi because I was feeling pretty comfortable. Running a fairly easy, steady pace, I finished in 1hr 55mins. I was tired but happy, and not completely exhausted.  Bearing in mind I was training to simply finish a half marathon, I'm now slightly concerned that I set my goalposts too far apart. I want a target that is hard to achieve but feasible with enough training, and a bit of mental fairy dust.  So: Could I feasibly switch to running a full marathon in a respectable time (which would be more of an impressive achievement in my eyes), with 15 weeks of training? If so, would I be looking to simply finish, or could I probably try a good time? "
3576,Possible training approach while in holidays,"My workouts consist of weight-lifting followed by a moderate cardio session. I'm pretty used to it, but I have a growing concern; I'm visiting my folks for the holidays and I plan to stay there for 11 days. And I won't have access to a gym while over there. Is pure cardio enough for these 11 days? Or should I use stuff around the house to have something to lift?  "

The only exercise I get are 5km bike rides to my university whenever I have classes there and I go out for 20 minute walks twice a week, but he said it wasn't enough. Exercise aside, I'm rather healthy: I eat responsibly, don't drink and don't smoke. My BMI is 20.  I'd prefer exercises that I can do anywhere and don't require too much special equipment. I don't want to go to a gym because I don't like working out, I'd lose time on transport, it costs more money and I don't want to exercise with other people around. I was linked to the SimpleFit website that sets out a bodyweight exercise plan to build up strength.  Now, I assume that you could potentially harm yourself if you're doing it wrong. What are the dangers of doing push-ups, pull-ups and squats incorrectly? Would you advise against trying this out without supervision? "
3578,How much more cardio for fat loss?,"26 years old, 160 lb, roughly 20% body fat.   I eat a pretty normal vegetarian diet. I avoid soda, fruit juice, anything with sugar. Maybe one can of soda or a candy bar per week at the most. I do eat quite a bit of cheese though, so definitely getting some fat from that. I'm not sure how many calories I get per day, but I would estimate somewhere around 2500. I try and eat carrots, broccoli, spinach, and kale every day. I usually eat quite a bit of peanut butter toast, always on whole wheat bread, eggs, and greek yogurt.  I also ride my bike every day. I have a bike computer to keep track, and it comes out to 5 miles per day for the past four months, every single day. I usually bike at 12-15 mph. Sometimes up to 20 mph on flat ground.  I'm not really noticing any fat loss, but my quads are huge now. My main goal is fat loss though. How much do I need to increase my cardio? Should I bike 10 miles per day, or should I do jogging as well? Is biking really cardio? It sort of feels like weight training just for my legs. Do I need to cut cheese out altogether? How much should I cut out in terms of calories? If I do cut calories out, is it normal to feel hungry all the time?  Thanks!!  Follow up:  Wow!! Thank you so much to everyone who responded. I've been keeping very careful track of all my calories. Juice has way more calories than I thought possible. Time to switch to decaf tea. (Caffine makes me feel sick) And I didn't know how much an ounce of cheese was, I had to weigh it out, haha! Today I ate 1800 calories, and added 20 minutes of jogging to my fitness routine. I figure biking 20 minutes at 15 mph is about 200 calories burned, so I am shooting for a daily ""deficit"" of 600 calories. I'll eat 1800 calories, jog for 200, and bike for 200 more. That way I am 4200 calories short per week, which I am guessing is around 1.25 lbs lost per week. I'm also adding in: 100 push ups per day, 10 pull ups, 10 chin ups, and if possible, doing weight training at the gym 3 days a week. I know it's not cardio, but I'm bound to burn some calories with that extra exercise.  My only question now: will I be losing purely fat? Or some muscle with that fat as well?   Thanks again folks! Now it's just a matter of sticking to my routine.  "
3579,Are small workouts worth the time?,"I have a set of adjustable dumbbells in the basement that I haven't used in awhile and every time I start an exercise regiment, it never lasts. I would like to start using them again, minimally. But, if I'm just using them minimally, is it even worth my time?  For example, if I were to use the dumbbells to do a variety of upper and lower body exercises three times a week, 20 minutes per session, is that going to do anything at all?  I'm not looking to get bigger, just general fitness. I sit behind a desk all day and just want to get some use out of muscles that don't normally get used during the day. "
3580,Do bodybuilders lose their sex drive when they are dyhadrated and extremely low in body fat for competition?,"Even though their bodies literally exude maximised sex appeal thus bodybuilders naturally convey this idea of strong sex drive or horniness I heard a fit guy say that bodybuilders only look like the ultimate epitome of male sex energy, but in reality they lose their sex drive due to being so dehydrated and being so low in body fat when they compete.  Is that right? Do dehydration and low body fat make bodybuilders' sex drive go away?  The competitions always have a bit of sexual charge for obvious reasons (nothing wrong with that) so it surprised me to hear how that extreme preparation may deprive them of what they seem to project in abundance. "
3581,Do I need to gain weight if I'm overweight? (Starting StrongLifts program),"I'm 5'6 and 176 lbs with a high body fat %. I am overweight (with man boobs and big belly with love handles) and just started the StrongLifts 5x5 program.   While reading the starter pdf included, Mehdi mentions that I need to eat and maintain about 3000 Calories to keep up with the program and gain weight.   My question is, do I need to eat 3000 Calories or more a day even if I'm overweight? And if I don't meet the 3000 Calorie mark, will it affect my StrongLifts performance? "
3582,Resistance bands strengths,"Not sure if this would actually be the correct place to ask this (perhaps math or physics?).  Say I have some resistance bands (to help doing pull ups).  Green band is marked as being able to assist with 50-100 lbs Purple band is marked as being able to assist with 30-70 lbs   If you were to overlay or “combine” these two bands and use them as one, would it be fair to assume that the strength assistance is just “adding” the two together to get an assist of 80-170 lbs? Or how does that math work, perhaps way more complicated than that? "
3583,circuit training and walking schedule,"I do circuit training at least 5 days a week (30 minutes).  It is without equipment combining, running, mountain climbing, burpees, jumping jacks, pushups, squats, ab exercises, etc.  I also walk for 45 minutes in the evening.  It is fast walk, covering 2km.  Typically carrying  my 2 year old son.  We walk to a park 1km away.  He plays for 15 mins. Then we walk back.  This I do all weekdays.  Besides that my life is mostly sedentary except for chasing after my son :)   Am I overdoing it on the exercise part?  I prefer not to change my walking schedule.  Do you think I should cut back on circuit training?  What is the optimal number of times I can do circuit training in a week? Is circuit training without equipment an effective strength training routine? Last week I couldn't go for the walk and followed only the circuit training routine.  I gained back almost a kg.   My aim is to reduce my post-pregnancy weight gain.  I have been moderately successful in that I have lost 10 kg.  But I still have a long way to go, at least another 10 kg.  I mostly eat only healthy food.  But there are times when I have extra portions and also once or twice a week, we eat out.  Do you have any suggestions for me?  Thank you,  Sharmila "
3584,"Can you actually lose strength from exercising (for example, if you don't get enough food)?","As far I understand, typical muscle growth from excercise occurs as follows: - cause microdamage in muscles with heavy excercise - microdamage is repaired by your body and a bit of extra muscle tissue growth in the process  My question: can the repair process be disrupted leading to LESS muscle being restored than was lost? For example, if ones diet is very poor in protein and/or calories?  "
3585,"New to working out, is this good?","I want to do martial arts but I'm very physically weak, I struggle to do 15 push ups in one go. I've got a very slim build and a bony body (this helps in fights because I have a harder than normal skeleton). My waist size is roughly 28-30 inches in circumference. Weight is 50kg. I don't know other info you may need but ask if you do.   I'm currently starting with a small warm up, jogging for about 1 minute around the garden, stretching for another and then I start working my muscles. I do 10 push ups and then 20 squats and repeat that 5 times, take a 2-3 minute break and then do it again. after that I throw punches with my weight and muscle behind each one 150 times and go straight to... I have no idea what there called, I think crunches? hands behind my head lying down and lift myself with my stomach until elbows touch my knees, I do this thirty times, 1 minute break and then another 30. I know what to eat but I want confirmation if this is good or not, self made workout and I have no weights so I'm doing what I can.  I also want to improve my reaction time, mine can take nearly half a second at its worst and 250ms at its best and I heard there are exercises that can improve that, I play games a lot of my day because I have nothing else to do. Anything else I should do?  "
3586,Mixing anaerobic or lactate threshold training and base aerobic training in the same workout,"I typically have 1.5 hours available for a workout once a day. However I  can only really manage around 45 minutes of effective high intensity intervals or lactate threshold training in one session.  Is there a benefit in filling the remaining time with base aerobic training? Or is it a better use of that time to do strength training, or simply rest?  If there is value in combining different levels of aerobic, threshold + anaerobic exercise in the same session, what's a good way to structure it to get the most benefit? "
3587,"Injured bicep, will it now be susceptible to future injury?","One of the strong points about my physique has always been my biceps, but unfortunately last week I injured my right one.  Last Friday, I was doing single arm preacher curls with 75lb (34 kg) dumbbells (nothing new for me, have been doing this weight for months). I guess my form was a little off and I felt a really sharp pain in my bicep on the second rep, I dropped the weight immediately.  The pain was not at the shoulder or at the elbow, but in the middle of my bicep.  It hurt to flex or extend my arm, so I left the gym immediately. The second day, I could extend my arm but it hurt to flex. Fast forward a few days and all pain is gone. I re-entered the gym on Monday and did exercises without a pulling motion. Today, I worked back and I was fine for most of the workout, until I attempted a heavy deadlift set (I know, stupid). My bicep is hurting a little when I flex, but not as bad as the original pain.  Obviously I need to rest it more, this just seems like a Grade 1 sprain, and I think I'm going to take the whole week off next week (I haven't taken a break in over a year, it's probably long needed).  My question is, is this just a sprain? And will my bicep now be susceptible to injury/tear more often? Or will it heal back 100% after sufficient rest? "
3588,Is this appropriate training for a person with lumbar L4-L5 and neck C4-C5 protuding disks?,"Today I went to the gym for the first time to get the program from my trainer. I warned him I have protuding disks in my lumbar and neck areas (lumbar L4-L5 and neck C4-C5). I am going through physiotherapy and I got relevant improvements in the last two weeks, after years of pain and difficulty in moving and occasionally walking. I am around 70 kg, 180 cm. Completely out of training, generally fragile.  The program mostly involves cardio (bike) for heating up (10 min)-cooling down (20 min), and machines to strengthen various muscles. I am a complete ignorant on this regard, but I went through 7 machines, one for the lower back, one for the abdominal (both involved bending my back forward) two for the legs, one for the arms, biceps and so on. I am sure you know which machines I used, but this is a sample of some of them.   I worked with 15 kg in most machines, doing 15 repetitions of the movement every time. I did the full round of the seven machines only once, but I am supposed to do two rounds each time, twice a week.  The point is that after this exercise, now my back hurts as it used to before starting physiotherapy. I don't know if it's expected, nor I know if I can actually bend my back in those machines considering my situation. Do you think the work plan is appropriate, or should I skip those machines ? Alternatively, what can I do to improve my situation ?   Thanks  "
3589,Swimming after running. Effects on body temperature regulation,Triathlons have the swim leg first.   But what about someone who wants to relax and cool down in the water after a run? It is known that running (or any exercise really) raises body temperature a bit. It is (is it?) also known that sudden body temperature fluctuations are not a good thing.   So is there a real problem in jumping into the water while the body is still warm from the running - w.r.t body temperature regulation? How long of break is advisable before getting in the water after running?   Let us assume the water temperature is between a comfy 25-30 celsius. Although it would be appreciated if answers covered a broader range of water temperatures.  
3590,Need to run every day - best way to stop?,"I'm a 25-yr-old, healthy male.  For the past 7 years or so I've been running every day (except 1-4 times / year when health or other things got in the way)  If I don't run on a certain day:   I feel really cranky and depressed, everything has a negative edge to it I have trouble sleeping that night My legs feel worked up, like I want to use them (If I got aerobic exercise other ways I think my legs would still feel worked up)   So now I run every morning - just for 20-25 minutes, at around 6.5 - 7mph.  Usually on a treadmill, sometimes outside.  It's nice to burn the calories and boost my metabolism, but it's annoying to have to run every day!  Is there a way for me to stop running, or just run less, but not experience the bad symptoms I described above?  Maybe a drug I can take?  "
3591,Running on the spot vs walking,"UK health guidelines suggest that adults should aim to take 10,000 ""steps"" per day, and that less than 5,000 should be considered a sedentary lifestyle.  I walk and cycle rather than take the car for most journeys and assumed I'd make this target easily. Some months ago I got some pedometer software included in a new smartphone and was shocked to discover I only averaged about 7,000.  Since then I've been making up the shortfall by running on the spot when I have nothing else productive to do - waiting for the kettle to boil, or cleaning my teeth for instance. I feel better for it too: I've lost weight, and my aerobic capacity has improved.  However, a friend who is a bit of a fitness fanatic recently told me this was ""cheating"" and ""didn't count"". She was unable to elucidate as to why when challenged.  This seems patently absurd: while running on the spot lacks the accelerative component of actual running and is obviously less exercise, you're still lifting the legs and working the aerobic system to some extent.  So: am I right in thinking running on the spot is valuable exercise? Is it more or less of a workout than an equivalent amount of rapid walking? And, if these things are true, where might someone get the idea that it's ""cheating""? "
3592,Can a person with high myopia sprint?,"Can a person with high myopia sprint? By sprint, I mean normal 100m and 200m sprints. And by high myopia, I mean people with -6 diopters and above. Will this increase the chance of getting a retinal detachment? "
3593,BodyBuilding - Plateau and a new Workout Plan - Intermediate - Advanced,"I have been traning my current session since December, that is about three months.  If I consider my whole 3 years of traning sessions I would say this one to be the best. I learnt some new ideas particularly on the nutrition part - having more Protien each day, eating each 3 hours and etc..  I'm following a plan I made by myself which based on :  1. Workout Routines :    - Chest/Biceps   - Back/Triceps   - Shoulders/Legs  2. Workout Phases: (5-6 days a week)    - Sunday : Chest/Biceps   - Monday : Back/Triceps   - Tuesday : Shoulders/Legs   - Thursday : Chest/Biceps   - Friday : Back/Triceps   - Saturday : Shoulders/Legs   I feel very fatigue from this workouts although having 3-4 Whey Protien and other Protien sources each day allow me to recover pretty fast.  I would also like to say my training is really hard, very hard. I'm pushing myself to the limits and also add 30 mintues of cardio and small lifting in the end of the workouts - while doing abs I also do simultaneously on each workout a bench press with 60kg (just to stimulate my chest more and more) and 10 military press. That is, each 50 crunches I do bench press, military press, some lower abs, running(speed 15, 1 minute and calm down), pushing rope and come back to another 50 crunches - doing this like 3-4 times in the end of the workout.  Each workout totals to 1:30 - 2:00 hours.  I decided today to stop training for a week becuase I believe I'm having plateau and It's annoying. I have few questions on how should I continue when I come back to my next 3-4 months training session.   One important thing I want to do as I come back is to change my workouts as much as possible, I was considering following this article ([website]It includes some workout I don't use, new mixes and more important new body parts division. According to this arctile I have 2 phases : Loading Phase and Growth Phase. On which phase should I increase wights and on which phase should I decrease wights. Does this article includes Deloading? Is it good thing? Is it used only to avoid plateau or as a training method? I just hate lifting lower wights and I want to know why It is good and if so, When...... Is 1:30-2:00 hours workout is really too bad? I just want to train my abs each workout and including 1:00 hour of my workout + abs It totals to 1:30 - 2:00. What can I do to avoid plateau for the next time?.   One important note I would like to advice with you. I'm consider myself as pretty strong guy (according to the wights) and yet my muscles are not so large.  According to @Jeremy Likness, ""and the reason why some people can be extremely strong without having large muscles - it's because their neurological system reacts to the workout by improving coordination of motor units, the bundles of nerves that fire to contract muscle (when you lift a heavy weight or a small one, motor units are helping you do that and it's just a question of how many are activated at once)""  Can someone explain me what does Jeremy means? One thing I want to change is my muscle, I hate it that I have strength but the muscle isn't large. I can lift 100-110 kg on Bench Press and 32kg on each hand on Sholdurs Press and so on and yet my arms and chest isn't big enough and the muscle are not large as I exepect them to be. How can I change it?  It is pretty long post with alot of confusing concepts on my part, I would appreciate If you could answer some of the questions or make some of the concepts clearer.  Thank you all!   Guy "
3594,What is the proper procedure for showering in a gym locker room?,"This is going to sound like a stupid question. I apologize. But I've had it on my mind for a while and it needed to be asked.  My question is: how do you use the shower at the locker room at the gym?  I told you it was stupid.  But really, I've had gym memberships for a total of about 5 years during my life (not consecutive). I've gone frequently and worked out, but I've never used the showers there. Why not? Honestly, I've just been too nervous about it. It's not so much public nudity itself that makes me nervous. It does make me feel weird and a little self conscious to take my clothes off in a room with other people in it, but I don't think other people really care that much. What does worry me though is the possibility of committing some kind of social faux pas or perhaps even exposing myself to some kind of safety hazard.  Some of the things that have run through my mind as I contemplate taking a shower at the gym:    Where do I keep my clothes?  If in a locker, should I wear a towel between the shower and the locker? Where do I keep the towel while I'm in the shower? Not every place I've been to has somewhere to hang it. If there are no private showers, is it normal to shower in a bathing suit or similar attire? My current gym has private shower stalls with curtains, but I've been to gyms where the showers were more community style. Where do I keep my cell phone/wallet/keys? I can't really bring them with me into the shower, so I suppose I'd have to keep them in the locker. But is that safe? If someone broke into my locker while I was in the shower, I'd lose everything valuable and I'd have no clothes. If I use a shower that strangers have used, are there any possible health repercussions? Do I need to wear sandals to protect against athlete's foot, for example? Is it normal/OK to perform other grooming functions, such as shaving, or brushing your teeth, in a gym locker room? Etc   So again, in summary, what is the safest and most socially acceptable way to use a locker room at the gym?  It does surprise me how anxious I feel about this, considering I'm usually pretty laid back about most things. I have been to the hot springs and even bath houses in Japan, when I was there visiting friends. But I felt less anxious about that because I was accompanying people who knew what they were doing, and I just did my best to imitate them. When I go to the gym locker room by myself I feel completely out-of-sorts. I feel like everybody else in the world has read some secret manual about how to deal with this and nobody ever handed me a copy. Please help!  If there's some cultural ambiguity about social customs, please assume for the purposes of this question that we're talking about the United States. "

3596,Bodybuilding - Myofibrillar and Sarcoplasmic hypertrophy - Building muscles,"I'm training for two years, trying to develop muscles (for astethics, being big and not for strength training).  I read that in order to do that I should work more on my sarcoplasmic hypertrophy. As I'm building a workout plan built on the periodilazion method I want to understand a basic concept.  Until today I believed that in order to develop muscles and being big I should train with as much as weight as possible even for 1-5 reps.  Today I read that in order to develop or work on my sarcoplasmic hypertrophy I should train with low intensity and high volume that is low weights, and more reps (8-12) and more sets (3-5). Am i right ?  If i understand correctly and i'm using the periodilization method then on my first month while I'm using 70%-75% of my strength for 1 rm then this is the phase in which I will bulk up ?  And then on the second month as I'm using 75%-85% of my strength for 1 rm and less reps/sets  (high intensity and low volume) then I will work on my strength ?   I would like to understand what's the best periodilization method division I should use in order to bulk up that is work as much as I can on my sarcoplasmic hypertrophy.  Thank you very much !!! "

3599,How to create a good personalized bodyweight workout plan,"I'm currently in the position where I want to start working out, but I do not want to aimlessly begin doing just anything.  First my target goal for training is an overall fitness to counter my all-day office job. This overall fitness should include strength, endurance, balance and coordination.  My second premise is that i do not want to go to the gym. So the training has to be mainly with body-weight exercises.  The basic question now is how do I get a good personalized workout plan?  Sure, there are tons of plans on the internet. But let's be realistic; none of this basic workouts considers my fitness level and weaknesses.  So, from my perspective, an optimal workout plan will start with an fitness tests in which will be determined what fitness level the person has and which muscles are stronger or weaker. Is there any test that would test these things and show which body parts have deficits?  Based on these facts, it would be perfect to create a workout plan in which the weak parts of my fitness will trained harder, than the good ones until I have reached an balanced good fitness level.  So now the question: Are there any tools, websites, books, information that will help to create an good personalized bodyweight workout plan?   Any suggestions are welcome. "

3601,Why don't my thighs hurt?,"I have been running for almost 2 years now, after pretty much never running before in my life.  I have had the usual injuries (shin splints, sprained ankle, etc.), but nothing serious.  I've always thought I was doing everything right, until I saw this video about the day after the marathon:  [website]The thing is, my thighs have never - not once - hurt after a run!  My calves have hurt, as well as my feet, hips, etc.  So what am I doing wrong? Or am I doing anything wrong at all?  Some sites suggest this could be because I have weak thighs, and the rest of my legs are picking up the slack.  But I can comfortably leg press about 3 times my body weight, so I don't think that's the problem.    Is this something to be concerned about? Or is it just marathon specific: I mean, I've never run more than a 10K. "

3603,How many reps are ideal for increasing muscle mass?,"Research  In Ultimate Bodybuilding: The Master Blaster's Principles of Training and Nutrition Joe Weider says the following:     I learned that the best repetition range for building muscle mass is   5-8.   In the Wikipedia article on muscle hypertrophy, the recommended rep range is 8-12 reps:     Strength training typically produces a combination of the two different types of hypertrophy: contraction against 80 to 90% of the one-repetition maximum for 2–6 repetitions (reps) causes myofibrillated hypertrophy to dominate (as in powerlifters, Olympic lifters and strength athletes), whereas several repetitions (generally 8–12 for bodybuilding or 12 or more for muscular endurance) against a submaximal load facilitates mainly sarcoplasmic hypertrophy (professional bodybuilders and endurance athletes).   In contrast, the training program Shortcut to Size by Jim Stoppani on bodybuilding.com uses reps in the 12-15 range:  Barbell Bench Press - Medium Grip 4 sets of 12-15 reps Rest-pause on final set   On stackexchange itself, this post links to a chart that recommends 6-12 reps for muscle growth. The confusion here is that the Wikipedia article above mentions 2-6 reps for strength improvements.  Feeling  It feels as though trainers, bodybuilders, and sport scientists cannot agree on the ideal rep range for muscle growth. This could be attributed to the mantra that ""every body is different"", but that's not very scientific.  Questions   Is there an ideal rep range for increasing muscle mass, and if so, what is it? How much difference does the rep range make? Why is there so much contradiction between sources?   Update 1  I don't remember the name, but I read a book a couple of years back that contradicts the mantra that ""every body is different"" using the premise that human physiology is for the most part the same for all people, which feels plausible.  Update 2  One of the comments got me thinking about another mantra: ""You gotta lift big to get big."" It follows that by increasing the reps you decrease the weight, which eventually will mean you break that mantra. I suppose the truth of that mantra is for another question, but my feeling in this question is that Joe Stoppani's plan breaks it.  Update 3  An answer has caused me to question why rep ranges get so much focus. I started thinking about training intensity, which is often cited as needing to be high. I've started wondering if the reason rep ranges get so much focus is because it's easy to understand and measure when compared to intensity. "
3604,Eating enough carbohydrates to build muscle,"There is an issue I always surpressed my mind of: the necessary carbohydrates per day.  One thing I learned a while ago is the importance of consuming at least 20 gram of protein per 3-4 hours in order to build muscle.   Consuming enough protein seems to be very easy to me, when I can't have a real meal I just take Whey Protein and I know I have enough protein in the body for the next 3-4 hours.   How much carbohydrates I need is what I am always guessing. My guessing is to get as much as carbohydrates as I can as long I don't feel like I ate too much. Each time I take Whey Protein, I drink a cup of milk with 5 spoons of oatmeal (just from the box without boiling it). Sometimes I also add some whole rice (4-5 spoons) and sometimes just a banana/yogurt.  In the evening, after a workout I take Whey Protein then I shower and 30 minutes later I consume 2 whole bread, eggs and cottage cheese.  Is it enough? Is consuming Whey Protein and Oat Meal mostly enough? What can I do better?  EDIT:  I'm 26 years old, my height is 1.83cm and my bodyweight is 90kg. "
3605,Dumbbell exercise,"Someone told me that while I am practicing weight lifting using dumbbells, namely lifting the dumbbell from low waist region to say shoulder or chest level, if I move my shoulders while lifting it up, then it might lead to a shoulder sprain. Is what he says correct? If so, then how exactly am I to lift dumbbells without moving my shoulders even a tiny bit? "
3606,Proper sleeping time after tough workouts?,"Everywhere it is written to ""sleep well"" to lose weight and build muscle.  I wonder what is the ""correct"" number of sleep hours? For Cardio workouts? Weight lifting?  If I'm doing a more intense workout (such as Crossfit) would I need more sleep hours? "
3607,Choosing the right shoes for a 5k begginer runner,"Background:   I am a 22 years old guy and I recently started running again after 4-5 years of break( studying, work etc). For now I run for about 5k (in 2 weeks or so). In the past I was in a good shape, I ran, I was doing calisthenic workout etc. Anyway, the thing is that I never used a good running shoe. I always used and still use very cheap nike or reebok. For now I use reebok shoes, I dont know exactly the name but they are cheap.   In the second 5k I ran, from the beggining(0.5-1k) I had a pain in the left ankle, on the right side(inner side). I also noticed that especially my left foot, is going a little inside like pronation but I have not seen a specialist or something. ( I recently bought birkenstock eva sandals and my right foot went in like omg it fitted perfectly from the start, but in my left foot, I had a pain in my sole and it took me like 2-3 weeks to get used to it.)  Because I am getting a headache on choosing the right shoes, whats your opinion? My budget is about 70e. I recently went in a shoe store and I tried saucony cohesion 10 but I was feeling the sole very hard. Then I tried a kinvara 8 and it felt good but they werent exactly my size(0.5 smaller than my size). I did a little research on brooks and hoka also (hoka is a bit expensive for me).   What do you think about kinvara 7(I found them for 67e), brooks launch 3 (60e) and cohesion 10 (50e)? What would be better for me or if you have some other model please be my guest. If you think that a shoe that costs like 100e would make a big difference in running than a 70e shoe for me that I run like 5k (I aim for 10k and higher, so I will use the shoes very very often), please suggest me!  Any help would be appreciated! "
3608,What's the difference between eating 2000 Calories at once compared to eating 4 times a day at 500 Calories?,"I wonder is there any difference in how many times I eat per day?  Let's say I eat one big meal in the morning at 2000 Cal (at 9am). Is that any different than having 4 meals at 500 Cal throughout the day (at 9am, 1pm, 5pm, 9pm)?  I think I will be hungry by the end of the day if I eat just once in the morning. But I won't be hungry if I eat 4 times a day at smaller portions? How is that possible?    Which way is it better to eat? Maybe twice a day at 1000 Cal? (9am and like 4pm?)  Head scratch. "
3609,What does it mean to 'condition the body'?,"I read on this page the phrase, 'Treading water – great all round body conditioner'.  What does this mean, to condition the body?

3610,Program to gain both muscle and endurance,"I hope it's pretty simple. What is the best program to both gain some muscle mass/strenght and gain endurance ? Would it better to alternate frequently (every 1-2 days) between cardio training and weight lifting or go for a smaller frequency (1-2 weeks) ? In case this matters, I have a BMI of about 20 that I plan to get to about 23 and I can run a semi-marathon but I'm aiming for a Half-Ironman. "

3612,"Eating 6 time a day, how?","Any of you probably now, that if you want a good muscles, then you need a good supply (it's an pretty obvious truth), so to gain mass it is probably good to eat six or even more times a day (I meet this advice on literally every site devoted to training and mass gaining).  No problem with that advice, I agree, this is probably the right requirement for those who wants to gain mass and muscles.    The problem is, where do I find such a lump of time? I'm a working man. I can't afford to spend a 4 hours in a kitchen each day preparing 6 different portions of food which contain different fixings and 3 different types of meat.    How do you deal with this problem? Are you have someone who cooks for you, or...? "
3613,A 2900-3200 Calories/Day Plan for Weight Loss?,"I'm currently 172 lbs, 5'8"", ~32"" waist, and am trying to lose weight via losing fat, and have been trying to figure out a good amount to eat per day. My exercise per day is... hard to say exactly. I'm about 6 weeks into the Insanity Max 30 Program, take a 1-hour martial arts class twice a week, go to the gym at least once a week, and do other exercises on days I'm not doing anything else. For a while, I'd been eating around 1100-1650 calories each day, but I noticed that one week, even though I eat a lot on Thanksgiving(which was in that week), I'd lost 7 lbs! I'm not sure how that's possible, but that's what the scale said.  My personal trainer suggested I should be eating 2900 - 3200 calories each day. That seems like an awful lot, doesn't it? Since he suggested this I've been eating probably around 2500 per day, and honestly think I may have started gaining weight again, but I haven't weighed myself yet. Is it even possible to lose weight eating that much each day?  tl;dr: 172 lbs, 5'8"", male, aiming to lose fat, personal trainer said I should eat 2900-3200 calories per day, can I lose fat doing so?

3615,How to run with hemorrhoids?,"During last autumn I had a pain caused by hemorrhoids.   I got meds from a doctor and changed my lifestyle a bit. I changed my diet and started to run. I actually found running awesome sport, as I can do it both alone and with other people, both in park nearby and new places. I lost 10 kg, started to feel happier (endorfines!) and less sleepy.   I had a half year period with no pain at all and suddently it came back. It happened to me after more intensive training (a track with many ascents), followed by quite intensive walk in the mountains. I've also drunk much coffee during the walk which presumably increased blood pressure.  I'm currently following my doctor advice to rest from intensive sport, to let my hemorrhoids turn back from 3rd degree. I'm taking meds.  But then I would like to come back to running and wonder how can I avoid similar problems in the future. I've read hemorrhoids are quite common issue for runners but despite this issue they still are actively running.   What would you advice me? Are there any exercises to make me more resistent to such issues? Will exercises for core stability help?  So far, I've been doing the following:   removed coffee and tea completely from my diet to avoid high blood pressure  limited spicy stuff from my diet like pepper or onion removed beer and any other alcohol almost completely  stopped reading books in a toilet :-) high fiber diet (plums, peaches, etc.) and supplements with fiber drink more water and linseed taking sitz baths with camomile and oak bark  "
3616,Dumbell routine issue,"Been doing weights the last few weeks now.  Leaving my ego at the door - I'm a small build kinda guy.  I started off at 5kg then worked my way up to 10. I'm currently doing 8-12 reps of bicep curls, hammer curl and concentration curls but I'm beat after one set.. my arms can barely make 5 reps on the next set? Should I lower the weight?  Also, is this routine ok for arms? My arms are not sore the next morning anymore after being totally beat the previous day.. should they be? What am I doing wrong 😣😣😣 "
3617,What is the minimum effective dose of running that constitutes HIIT?,"I've been doing Cooper runs (1.5 miles) as fast add I can 2-3 times per week, followed by an upper body workout (I know, friends don't let friends skip leg day).  How can I determine whether that constitutes HIIT? Is that simply a function of heart rate and duration? If so, what are the parameters? "
3618,Did walking & stretching on my rest day made my lower back sore?,"I'm doing StrongLifts 5x5. I hit gym in the night hours and this is the situation:  BW: 64kgs Saturday: Rest Sun: 6km walk Mon: Squat 75kg 3sets of 5 reps, Bench 42.5kg 5x5, Barbell Row 42.5kg 5x5 Tue (yesterday): 6km walk + 20min session of dynamic stretching. Wed (tonight, 7hrs from now): Squat 75kg 5x5, OHP 31kg 5x5, Deadlift 90kg 1x5   I usually sit in front of computer for the entire day, so I wanted to do walking and a bit of stretching on rest days. I heard that it helps in recovery too. I started walking on Sunday and I didn't have any problem for next day's workout.   On Monday's workout, fearing injury, I only did 3 sets of squats that day as I felt my squat form wasn't good. Yesterday my back &amp; upper body was little sore. So I added a 20 min session of dynamic stretching to my yesterday evening's 6 km walk. Since waking up this morning, my lower back is very sore. It is as if I did a heavy workout. I don't understand why this happened. This wasn't as sore yesterday. I thought walking &amp; stretching would only help me in recovering.    Why did this happen? Do I need to change anything? What should I do about today's workout? Squatting 75kg 5x5 and then Deadlifting 90kg is definitely not going to go easy on my lower back.  "
3619,Working out - do taller people have it harder?,"Background:  I was working out with some friends today and during one of the exercises (jump squats) I jokingly said to my buddy (who is 5'4"" with a normal proportioned frame, I have a lean build) when he was cheating on the exercise a bit, ""Hey man, these are harder for me because I'm taller and weigh more, so no excuses!"" and laughed. I said it in jest, but then this girl scoffs at me with an attitude and says, ""That's BULL**! Obviously height and weight don't make a difference! Read a science book!"" (lol?)  The fact that she missed that I was clearly joking notwithstanding (it's called pep talk, lady), after thinking about it some more in the locker room with my buddy I actually wasn't even sure what the answer to the question was. That is:  What are the (intrinsic*) factors which influence how challenging a particular exercise is?  *intrinsic to the nature of the body as opposed to how one uses it   Definitions:  I like to think that I have a very solid foundational understanding of biology, but this goes beyond the basics into ATP expenditure, muscle fiber theory, etc.   What is ""challenging""?  First, we have to define what it means for an exercise to be ""challenging"". While there is certainly a psychological aspect to this, I would prefer to avoid that and stick with the pure biological definitions. Perhaps, an exercise is more challenging for person A than it is for person B if person A has to expend more energy proportional to their size than person B. I'm not sure this is the best way of looking at it but I obviously can't use something like ""If person B expends more energy"" because a bigger person will always use more energy than a smaller person quite naturally. The question is whether the bigger person's naturally bigger muscles 100% make up for the additional weight they have to lift to counter their own body...  Intrinsic factors vs non-intrinsic factors  I'm not looking for factors which affect how challenging an exercise is which are not innate to the biological system itself. Stuff like whether I had enough sleep the night before or are eating a proper diet — these factors are not relevant here. I'm assuming all these factors (which are relatively controllable) are otherwise equal in all comparisons of performance.  My current thoughts:  Height  Height—on the face of it—doesn't seem like it would too significantly affect an athletes performance, but I'm not totally sure. Yes, the oxygen is thinner up there, but that's insignificant, but my heart has to pump blood further to reach distant parts of my body. Is this somewhat of a factor? Unless heart strength scales proportionally with height (does it?), this seems viable.  Number of muscle fibers  It wasn't entirely clear to me reading basic skeletal muscle articles whether people vary significantly in the number of muscle fibers they have, and whether this has something to do with height or build.  Type of muscle fibers  Do taller people have, on average, a particular type of muscle fiber more than another (fast twitch vs slow twitch)?   Cardiac muscle strength vs body size  It is not clear to me whether the heart muscles increase in strength proportionally with body size. In fact, that so many large individuals (not simply fat, but big tall and otherwise healthy individuals) tend to have cardiac issues seems to attest to the fact that larger people put more strain on their hearts than smaller individuals (on average).  Other factors I'm missing  I'm sure there are other factors involved. If I think of others off the top of my head I'll add them to the list.  That's all I got. Help me out here. Thanks :) "
3620,What do I do about quadricep pain?,"Over the last few weeks, as the weight on my squats has gotten heavier I've been noticing some pain in my quadricep. Not the normal muscle soreness, it's a little sharper and feels ""deeper"" in the muscle. It also seems to go horizontally across the quadricep.   Looking up a muscle diagram it seems to be right around where the dot for Rectus Femoris is in this diagram:    Maybe just a touch lower, possibly where it starts turning into tendon. (Kind of hard to pinpoint, sorry.)  I found this article talking about Rectus Femoris pain: [website]And it talks about how tight calves (specifically the soleus muscle) can cause you to overcompensate using your quads when doing squats. My calves are super tight and that includes the soleus so... probably onto something there. The only caveat is I'm not getting the knee pain as they describe it, or at the same times (they say it's worse at night.)   What I do get is it will ""ping"" sometimes when standing up from a seated position, or climbing a stair. Between sets of squats my quads feel really, really tight almost like the muscle is clenching around that spot. That said, it doesn't seem to interfere with me actually doing the squats at all and I've been able to continue increasing the weight just fine.  So what do I do about it? The article suggests a trigger point massage but it also seems to be selling a book for it so...  Would just stretching more help? I've been considering some yoga between lifting days anyway.   Should I rest the muscle longer to let it heal? The longest I've rested since noticing this is 3 days... I'd rather not skip too many workouts and lose momentum.  "
3621,Training not having any apparent effect,"I'm 45, 5'10 (178cm) and 77kg, live in the French alps and I'm into skiing and mountain biking, and I'm trying to raise my overall fitness, though not for any competitive purpose.  I don't have a huge amount of time, so I have a usual circuit which is a 12-15k loop with around 500-700m of climbs varying from a 7% cruise to a 40% grind (there's no such thing as a small hill around here!). This usually takes me 45mins to an hour. I track all my rides on Strava and I've started using an HRM to see what that's doing. I usually find my heart rate sits at around 165 during the climbs and I can sustain that without it being a problem. Since April I've done about 38 such rides, plus a couple of longer ones. I did a 50k event with 2500m of climbs last weekend and essentially came last. I'm not feeling that my efforts are producing any results at all - my personal best ride this year was my second ride of the season while I had a cold and a hangover! Since then my results have essentially all been average - I don't appear to be making any improvement at all, even though I'm riding almost twice as much as I did in the previous two years. I can see I've built a fair amount of muscle, but it's not having any impression on my performance or how I feel about it. On Strava my position on leaderboards (admittedly, just about everyone else is on road bikes, not 15kg of full-sus rig!) is forever dropping - it looks like everyone else is getting better!  I eat pretty well - lots of fresh fruit and veg - and I limit myself to 1 caffeinated drink a day, and generally don't eat any desserts or sweet drinks. I tried moving to a slightly more protein-heavy diet (eggs instead of cereal for breakfast) for a month, but I generally felt worse on that and it didn't seem to make any difference.  I really, really hate running and have no interest in taking that up! I could do more road cycling, but I don't have a road bike, and I'm not really interested in a having a faster bike just to make my averages look better without actually being any fitter.  What do you think would be my best approach to improving overall fitness? Persevere with more of the same, or would you recommend I do something else? "
3622,Breathe with mouth open while jogging and running?,While jogging it is advised by many to breathe by mouth because it increases the intake of oxygen which is required for performance. The problem with me or some of you may be that mouth gets dry as well as throat after sometime and one have to swallow saliva to wet it again and again.  How should I deal with this breathing problem ? What are the best practices while jogging and running ? 
3623,Cardio at training days or not?,"At the moment, I'm working out in 3 splits:   Split: Leg + Shoulder, Tuesday. Split: Chest + Biceps, Thursday. Split: Back + Triceps, Saturday.   This is just for building up muscles, but now I want to add a bit of cardio training (20-30min) to my workout. Should I do the cardio training on my training days or on my rest days? What are the pro's and con's? Would appreciate any help. "
3624,Difference between curls with dumbbells and barbells when bicep curling,"I generally do normal biceps curls using dumbbells of 10 kilograms on each hand. With that I am able to do 20 curls with each hand at a stretch( I am a beginner).   However I tried today lifting a rod with 10 kilogram on each side (i.e.total 20 kilograms) . I initially thought that lifting a rod with 20 kg (10 kg on each side) with both hands(through the same distance) will be very similar to lifting 2 dumbbells of 10 kg each (one in each hand ,together) through the same distance.   A barbell is similar in principle to 2 dumbbells joined together. So I thought that i would be able to do the same number of repetitions . But I could do only 10 at a stretch. Can someone explain me why the difference? Is there some valid general reason, or was it a fault with my body(maybe tiredness or something which I thought i wasnt))? "
3625,Getting leaner but staying healthy,"I am on a 12 weeks transformation program and I passed 6 weeks. Vascularity has started to kick in, weight loss is happening, legs muscles can be felt esp quads and claves. So I guess belly fat is last.  I have big day coming up in matter of weeks and I am getting a lot of comments that I am getting weak which can be bad coz I might loose fitting of my clothes. So my problem is I wanna get muscle or mass along with getting leaner. What should I do?  Should I eat a lot? That will make the weight more or should I lift heavy? As I was going through program's,      shortcut to size   I saw change in food and added supplements. So if I increase my food my current program will not work. As it's size of fist portion of protein and crabs. So what should I do,""?  EDIT : I want to gain muscle and get fuller look. While not getting weak.  "
3626,Long overtraining - What is the solution and how much time is needed to recover?,"A week ago, followed by 4-5 months of high intensive training I decided to take a break from the gym. I felt very disappointed and discouraged as I was training very hard and there were no gains, unfortunately just the opposite.  These are the following indicators I believe implied that I was overtraining, but I ignored them:   Small gains in muscles, sometimes just the opposite – losing muscle and feeling weak. Generally fatigue (all the day). Difficult to sleep. Difficult to wake up in the morning.  I had red spots between the biceps and the forearm – the part which is opposite of the elbow, I don't know how it is called.   I am also pretty sure I'm experiencing overtraining because the following:   Each workout I trained in very high intensity for 2 hours. I trained almost every day. Each workout from the beginning till last week ( 4-5 months ) I trained to failure.   Although it is very hard for me to take a pause from the gym, I did it.   I have been learning so much about bodybuilding these days. In this forum and in the internet. I bought books related to bodybuilding and strength training for the first time in my life. I decided to stop going to the gym with no preparation and 0% knowledge.  Actually I'm pretty angry at myself that I never tried to study the theoretical part and just trained as hard as I can. I always believed this is enough. I spent so much time in the gym, If I do a simple calculation It would be 6 days a week * 2 hours of training = 12 hours per week.  I'm 26 years old, I work as a software developer and I'm an undergraduate student which puts a lot of pressure on me, but my will to success always pushed me so strong although there were no gains. You may understand me, when you are so busy in your life and you have no time to go out with your friends, speak in the phone and etc. – you also don't find the right time to sit down and ask yourself if you can fix the issue.  The only reason I decided to stop is due to Passover. I'm on vacation now(PTO) and I have time to think more deeply about my life. Luckily I didn't hurt my study, It goes well BUT I did hurt some aspects in my life – It might be the reason why I don't have a girlfriend, why I'm little depressed being occupied all the time by work/study and gym.  So I shared with you as much as I can to ask you about my return. Assuming I'm expireinceing overtraining and asssuming It did hurt me mentally (as you can see above) how much time do you believe I need to rest until my CNS will regenerate? When do you believe I can come back to the gym?  Two days ago I believed I can come back after a week while all I'm doing this week is studying (for school purpose) and also reading a lot of bodybuilding/strength articles all over the internet.  I just found an article at bodybuilding.com which specifics that if someone has been overtraining for 3-5 days, a one week rest is enough but for someone who has been overtraining much more than that, weeks to months are required to fully recover. Is it correct, what is the best indicator to come back to the gym? Can I do other stuff until the recovery is done (swimming, running, abs) ?  Thank you very much,  Guy "
3627,why am i suddently so worn out in cardio?,"I started gym 2 months ago and nearly every day except maybe 1 one rest day I will complete 1 hour cardio (about 500 calories, some days even 600-700) and an hour intense weight training targeting all major muscle groups (leg Monday, abs Tuesday etc). However lately (past 2 weeks) I burn about 80 and I am WORN out and over it and no energy (however push through it and just have more breaks &amp; rests until I can atleast reach 300) What could be some causes for this? I weigh 145 pounds, 170 tall. Am female &amp; eat around 1500 cals. Take a pre workout fat burner everyday and post workout whey protein. This still happens even if I go not fasted &amp; eat before. Happens even after rest day and adequate sleep. Could this be because of eating a calorie restriction for so long whilst straining my body? My calorie defecit is only 500 less than what it should be to try and lose weight. Any suggestions or advice? and no I don't over train my muscles and get adequate sleep "
3628,Do the calories from high-GI foods eaten in the morning count towards the energy you have in your evening workout?,"I guess I have multiple questions stemming from this one question actually.  Example scenario: Let's say a bodybuilder needs 2500 calories to be in a caloric surplus. Of his daily calorie intake, 15% comes from simple sugars and most are taken every morning. He worksout at 6pm 3-4 days a week.   Do the calories from the morning sugars count toward his calorie surplus even though they were not timed closer to the workout? Similarly, since his simpler carbs were taken so many hours before the 6pm workout, is there a good chance those would have had enough time for some of them to go towards fat storage rather than waiting around in the bloodstream for his 6pm workout (because they're not complex carbs)?  "
3629,Can I do both weight training and BodyPump?,"I was expecting to get a bit more cardio from a BodyPump but experience was different. I felt like I have done a full body strength session. Should I go for less weights? And do I need a rest day between the two. Lastly if I am already doing weights, would it be more effective to replace Body pump with a BodyAttack? "
3630,Should cyclists use weight training to strengthen underutilized muscles?,"I've read (and it seems intuitive) that cycling exercises some muscles more than others. Other than the obvious lack of an upper-body workout from cycling, are there specific muscles that tend to be disproportionately weak in cyclists? Can an imbalance of muscle strength lead to injury? Should cyclists perform weight training to strengthen specific muscles?  Related questions: [website][website]"
3631,Best routines to build muscle mass,"I'm 5'9'' and 153 lbs now and 24 years old. I've been working out regularly for a year now. But I feel that the results now is not as impressive as it used to be.   I go to the gym 4 times a week, 2 muscle groups each time. Monday chest and triceps, Tuesday back and biceps, Thursday shoulders and legs, Friday chest and abs. I also do abs on Tuesday. I work on chest twice a week because I want to build more muscle mass on my chest. I pretty much use the same weight for around 9 reps and 4 sets for each workout. Sometimes I add 2.5lb to each side for my chest workout. But I'm still not very satisfied with my chest muscle mass. How should I change my routine to build more muscle mass?  I've also heard that there are different cycles in training, bulking cycles and cutting cycles. Bulking cycles are for building muscle mass and in this cycle you are expected to eat more and you are likely to gain some body fat. And in cutting cycle, you do more cardio and reduce your body fat. Is that true if I want to build muscle mass progressively? Is it possible to build muscle mass without going through these cycles?  "
3632,Bodyweight Squats v. Barbell Squats for Calf Development/Involvement?,"So we already know that barbell squats pack on more mass than air squats; no mystery there. But I am wondering about the role that calves play in both of these. I have heard air squats involve minimal calf use, while barbell squats stress them out a lot. Is this true; and why would this be? Is it simply because of the extra weight? "
3633,What types of hip exercises are best suited for a runner?,"My apartment complex gym got a new hip machine that supports four types of hip exercises - flexion, extension, abduction, and adduction. I'm primarily a runner (I run 3.5+ miles three days a week, low impact cardio usually on an elliptical on the weekends), but I do strength training two days a week (3 sets of 10 reps, 70% of max) and recalibrate my max once a month.  Of the four hip exercises that this machine supports, which one(s) should I be doing to best support my running? A few quick searches suggests exercising (stretching and strengthening) flexors and adductors more frequently than others, but it's kind of vague. Should I do all four, or just a subset? And would be 3 sets of 10 reps at 70% of max be suitable for this type of exercise as well? "
3634,"Does your weight have ""momentum""","I'm obviously NOT talking about physics here - obviously your body has mass and therefore momentum.  What I mean is:  I've been tracking my weight over the last 18 months or so, and I know a fair bit about the amount of exercise I've done and my non-meal eating habits (whether I'm snacking more or less than usual)  It seems like there's a time delay between changes in my weight-affecting-behaviour and changes in my weight.  When I start exercising hard, it takes 3-4 weeks to get a noticeable shift in my weight, and then my weight will continue to drop even after I've dropped back to my ""normal"" amount of exercising.  It's acts much like my weight is a physical object, that I'm physically moving on the graph, and my behaviour is a force acting on that object with a certain amount of friction/gravity present so that if I do less exercise I reach a stable point and if I stop altogether, I gain weight.  Obviously, that's not LITERALLY true!  But (I perceive that) the effect is very noticeable.   Is this behaviour a recognized ""thing""? Does it have a name I can Google? If so, what is the mechanism behind it?   I could mutter the words ""hormones"" and ""homeostasis"" and wave my hands vigorously, but I'd be making it all up. "
3635,"Once I have activated a muscle, can I stop exercising it or will it forget to fire again?","After receiving help with this question I began working out my weak gluteus medius. Very rapidly I became able to do the exercises without pain or losing balance, and no longer feel pain while walking backwards or rotating my toe inwards. So... can I remove those exercises from my daily workout? Or is there a chance that my body will once again stop using the gluteus medius if I don't remind it how?   The same question goes for clam shells. I don't have as much proof that the exercise is working, but I gather that almost everyone gets results from clam shells as long as they actually do the exercise. So can I stop doing them and spend my limited workout time on other body parts instead? "
3636,"Stretching while cold, with no intent to exercise: any benefit?","I can find many opinions and a few scientific articles on stretching prior to exercise, with the takeaway that it probably doesn't help and might hurt a bit for that exercise session.  I have very poor flexibility in general, and it's affecting my ability to exercise to become more fit &amp; flexible. In other words, my flexibility is a gating factor for better health.  So, I'd like to just take a 10 minute break every hour to get off my computer &amp; stretch, which I could make time for easier than taking an hour chunk out of my day.  However, I don't want to do something that will have no effect, and certainly not something that might have a negative effect. The only studies I can find are about the effects on the immediate workout after cold stretching, but not the effects of cold stretching on long-term flexibility.  So:  Would cold stretching ~6 times @ 10 minutes daily increase my range of motion long-term, or would that chronically weaken the stretched muscles?  Would it be better to do ex. Ashtenga, including the proper warm-up poses, for say 30 minutes daily or perhaps two 15-minute sessions daily? "
3637,Separate carbs and fat in a meal?,I'm a boxer and I'm trying to cut a little weight while getting enough calories (of the right sort) to be able to train every day (3x high intensity and 3x medium intensity workouts per week). I try to go easy on carbs.  Example: I'm having whole grain pasta with veggie sauce and some tofu for protein for lunch. Is it OK to put some grated cheese on top? I'm not so worried about calories here because I still need more than the average person. I'm asking because I found that the combination takes me much longer to digest (much more than 2 hours). I still feel full after 2.5 hours and have to burp when I run. On the other hand a post workout shake with two tablespoons of oats and one tablespoon of peanut putter in it feels like it's digested in no time. Is that just me or is this normal? What else should I keep in mind? 
3638,Is there a difference between hydraulic rowing machines and pulley rowing machines?,"Is there a difference between hydraulic rowing machines and pulley rowing machines?  I am looking at getting a new rower and wanted to avoid a hydraulic one while not spending too much money.   I have been looking at the V-fit PTR1 Pulley Rower, which seems to work with the use of elastic (I may have got that wrong).  Does the pulley rower provide a more realistic rowing experience than the hydraulic ones and are there any other advantages / disadvantages? "
3639,Recomposition vs weight loss,"I understand recomposition to be about trading away fat for new muscle.   How is it different than weight loss as a goal? Would it ever be recommended to focus on purely weight loss first, and then strength later, rather than recomposition from the beginning?  "
3640,"Climbing the stairs in digitigrade fashion - less efficient, harmful?","When going up a staircase at work, I recently realized that my heel barely ever touched the surface of the stairs. At first, I dismissed it, figuring that it just made sense to put the entire foot on the stairs, particularly since I have fairly large feet for my size and not all stairs are deep enough that I can get my whole foot on them. I also think that I probably got into the habit when I had to scale stairs quickly in middle-school (three floor building with limited time in between classes) and was essentially launching myself up the steps, and landing on the ball of my feet let me absorb the impact better. However, with my current stride, I feel like my feet are remaining flexed out at all times, knees bent, such that there isn't any shock absorption going on. Is this an inefficient way to climb stairs? Is it potentially harmful if I continue doing it?  On a side note, I've also found that lately, when climbing stairs more slowly, I find it easier to turn a bit sideways so that my feet are angled on the stairs. It feels more stable. Raising my knees directly in front of me to mount the treads makes me feel like it's disrupting my balance backwards. Could this be related? "
3641,Is my exercise routine healthy?,"I read a few guides concerning push up programs and training the belly muscles and started my own routine, based on what I read. However I also read in this SE that an unbalanced training (e.g. only push ups) can be unhealthy.  I'm a fairly active person, I try to run 5-7 km once or twice o week. The idea of my training is just to keep in shape, not to achieve any particular weight loss/muscle building goals. My morning routine consists of:   Weider's Series for the belly everyday: [website](but not the whole program - just the idea of the exercises,  which I progressively prolong if I get used to a previous setting - right now I'm doing 8 series)  Push ups every other day:   7 push ups | 1 min holding in ""down"" push up position | 1 min break |  8 push ups | 1 min holding in the ""up"" push up position | 1 min break |  7 push ups | 1 min holding in the ""down"" push up position | 1 min break |  7 push ups | 1 min holding in the ""up"" push up position | 1 min break |  8 push ups | 1 min holding in the ""down"" push up position | 1 min break |  When I'll get comfortable with this setting, I plan on adding +1 push up to every series.  So my question is: is this an OK training routine and should I be worried of any balance/spine/general health issues? If yes, then what do you suggest I should change/add? I'll be very grateful for any suggestions! "
3642,How to get stronger without increasing fitness?,"I know this is total contradiction to this very domain name: fitness.stackexchange, but hear me out. Plenty of people come here asking for advice about foods, routines, muscle types, other neuro-bio stuff, etc.   I am here asking how I can gain strength without increasing fitness. It is my goal to become strong enough to deadlift 600 lbs. at a bodyweight no greater than 200 lbs. for a one-rep max.   While, yes, I do generally want a bit more fitness, what I only real care about is the ability to exert more force: strength. So this is why I want advice on strength-only, power-only routines that are not part of any program like Starting Strength (personal reasons related to Mark Rippetoe). Can someone give me some advice who is out there in the power world? Any programs (besides the latter), any tips, any other info I should know, etc.?  As stated, I can deadlift about 300 lbs. max now (and I'm in no workout routine, program, fixed diet, etc., etc.). I want to one day reach 600 lbs., preferably within 12 years, and will use no enhancements, steroids, h.g.h., etc.   Some information for those who'll make assumptions:  I am not a ""noob"" here, and I have lots of experience. I have just never stuck with anything and never made results that I wanted. I have lots of neuro-efficiency training (ability to exert myself as hard as possible), some explosive training like with cleans, etc. (although a lot of it has diminished), and I am quite neuro-effective (I can incorporate a lot of strength without any muscle tone/mass). I do not care about mass either, and strength, power, etc. are my goals, not endurance, long lasting, etc. "
3643,Help understanding my weight loss results,"I started working out again about 2 months ago, following a long period of inactivity, currently my body fat percentage is around 12% my goal is to get it down to 6%-8%. I'm on a low-fat high-protein diet (I make sure I get at least 2g of protein per kg) and I do 3 days of lifting followed by 20-30 mins of cardio (jogging) and the other 3 days I do 20 mins of aerobics and skipping rope.  Unfortunately I've just started tracking my progress two weeks ago, as you can see it doesn't seem to be slowing down, I lose around 0.5kg per week, however, I can't make sense of the data, what are those peaks after every weight loss, and why do they seem to be getting smaller ? will I eventually stop losing weight or is this a good thing ? I was thinking maybe it has something to do with water retention, or am I doing something wrong here ?    Update:  I take my weight every morning after going to the bathroom and before breakfast, at the same time, also when I started I was around 74Kg. "
3644,Feeling and Looking Young,"I am software programmer and I do lots of research like software/database architecture most of the time. I recently got comment from my friends that I am looking older than my age. I am 28 and I am said to look around 38. I came home and had a look in the mirror and saw that I have receding hair lines , big beard and unhealthy face. I don't exercise much. I am doing my MBA and hold a full time job where I have lot of responsibility.  My college are ending in a month and I will have more time. How can I revive my health and youth? Is there any suggestion to remain healthy internally and externally? "
3645,Whey protein intake and side effects,"I havent taken any whey protein, but now im planning to try and i just need to be clear with the instruction on how should i consume them.  I have several questions regarding with whey protein intake.   1. How often do i need to take whey protein?  2. How many scoops/grams per day?  3. If i take whey protein everyday will it cause anything with my     kidney?  4. Is taking whey protein good for getting cuts?  5. Is whey protein + oats good?  6. is it good if i just eat just oats for every meal of the day?   thanks in advance for the answers.  "
3646,Walking/jogging/sprinting causes pain in the abdomen?,"I usually walk 3 miles a day (other than at gym), whereas at the gym I stay on treadmill for 20 minutes juggling between walk, jog and sprint.  When I run quite for some time, I get a shooting pain at the right side of my abdomen! Not just this, at times when I walk quite a lot in any environment I get the same kinda pain. Also, the issue is not steady, it happens only when I breathe IN. And only till I am breathing little heavier than normal.  So, what might be the cause? What precautions should I take to not let this increase? Above all how do I make it right?  P.S - I don't remember this happening even once when I lift weights.  Stats -  Weight - 95 kg. Height - 185 cm. Been working out irregularly for 4-5 months. "
3647,Is being in a caloric surplus the only way to get fat?,"If you eat above your calorie maintenance level every day and don't use up those extra calories, it's very likely they go to fat stores.  But is that the only reason people get fat (being in a caloric surplus and not burning off the extra calories through physical activity)? Or is it possible for the body to still get fat even in a caloric maintenance or defecit in some other way (and how?)? "
3648,How do I promote connective tissue health/strength?,"Muscles can be trained and grown. Stretching can prevent injury to muscles, joints, and connective tissue.   But can connective tissues (tendons, ligaments) be trained and strengthened like muscles can, in any way? Separate but related, are there any foods or supplements (e.g. glucosamine?) that are reasonably known to be effective with respect to promoting connective tissue health, strength, and/or recovery (similar to steroid shots for injury, although granted supplements wouldn't be quite so effective)?  "
3649,Can I avoid Squating by doing sumo deadlifts,"I dont like squating, so Im avoiding doing squats. However I enjoy deadlifting and Im doing them every day.  A different variation each day. Is it really necessary to squat actually if you can do sumo instead? Or is there something special happening while doing the squat, something unique, that the deadlift doesnt give you? "
3650,Help understand chronic tightness behind knees,"I work at a desk 10 hours per day.  I'm also 45 years old.  Not suprisingly, the backs if my legs are chronically tight.    What seems unusual is that when exercising or stretching I always feel the tightness/pain directly behind my knees.  I'm not sure if the problem is tight hamstrings (upper leg) terminating in the knee, or the calf muscles (lower leg) terminating at the knee.  Or if the tightness is from neither.   When I do traditional hamstring stretches I feel the stretch most acutely behind the knee (not under my butt), likewise with traditional calf stretches, I feel behind the knee.   So the question:  am I feeling tightness behind the knee tight hamstrings/calves and I just happen to feel it behind the knees?  Or is it something else?  Any good stretches to relieve behind the knee tightness?  Thanks "
3651,How long should I wait after dinner before I start exercising?,"It's hot outside and I want to exercise after dinner, when it is a little cooler. Typically, I jog for a couple of miles or play one hour of tennis or basketball. I'm wondering how long I should wait after dinner to start these exercises. I did quite some search and the answers are all over the map, from no waiting at all to 3-4 hours. Can someone please give me some definitive and reliable hints, especially supported by research studies? Or there is no trivial answer because it depends on so many factors such as the amount of food taken in dinner and the intensity of exercise? "
3652,Visible abs of olympic athletes and diet,"In fitness context one often hears the statement: ""Abs are built in the kitchen"". Which means that you have to follow a very clean diet (together with a proper workout) to get visible ripped abs. For example if you have a look on the female fitness model interviews on simplyshredded.com you see that all of them follow a very restrictive diet. And even most of them have a very low carb diet and high protein diet.   Now I am interested in some background info's about the case of olympic athlets. Regardless of whether you consider track and field athlets like Jessica Ennis, gymnasts, divers, soccer players etc. there are many of them with really ripped abs. Sometimes it is said that you can eat everything what you want as a olympic athlet because you are training so much that you burn everything away. Is this statement true? If this is the case, is the training for example of an olympic 100m sprinter such more intense and burns such much more calories than that of a professional fitness figure model (which seems to train every day some hours).  How differs (especially concerning the restrictiveness of the diet) a typical diet of an olympic athlet with ripped abs from that of a professional fitness figure model and why?  "
3653,Adjustment from pool to lake for triathlon,"I'm looking to try a triathlon, and in preparation I've started swimming at a local 25/50m pool (lane lines put in different ways on different days). The triathlon swim is 800m; I've done that distance in the 25m pool in ~13 minutes and ~15 minutes in the 50m pool. Does anyone have a rough sense of how pool times convert to open water swim times?  Also could anyone with experience in both environments comment on the differences between pool swims and open water swims? I read somewhere about 'drafting' in open water, how effective is this technique? "
3654,Losing 1.5 stones in a week healthy?,"So it has been a week since I have been working and eating healthy. I weighed 14.5 stones and now I weigh 13 stones. My question is, what are the repercussions (if any) of losing weight quickly?  I here that it is ""wear and tear"" on the body, what does this mean? it seems to be a very common expression used by people, but I have no idea what kind of wear and tear on the body it is. "
3655,What is the best way to integrate brief sessions in my workplace gym into my strength and body building practices?,"My job as a software developer requires me to spend nine hours a day in an office. The building has a gym, but it is not so well equipped that I use it as my primary facility. I work out at another gym after work using a three day whole body split. I use a modified HIT routine and hit these three sessions with intensity.  Lately, I have been getting up from my desk and walking down to the gym at least once a day. For example, just now I came back from a five minute session where I just walked in and, without changing, pumped out fifty dips to failure with my legs stretched between two flat benches. Then I walked back up to my office and my outlook for the day is so much improved that I'm even motivated to write about the experience now. I feel better because I am pumped. Yesterday evening I trained triceps for real. Do you think that my single set to failure just now helped or hurt my prospects for muscular development?   My inclination is to keep this up, focusing each day on one of the muscle groups that I trained last during my primary sessions. I suspect that the additional period of pump each day will give my muscles a better environment for protein synthesis which will tend toward an overall increase of growth over time.  Or is there a reason anyone can tell me of that this extra work might be counterproductive because it interrupts the recovery period for the muscle which began after my last workout one or two days earlier? "
3656,What is the optimum training intensity to prevent atrophy when on a caloric deficit?,"I know that when I'm on a caloric surplus, I stimulate hypertrophy best if my training intensity lies somewhere between 6-12RM.   Now let's say I'm on a caloric deficit. What intensity is optimal for preventing my muscles from atrophying? Is it simply the same as above? Or should I (as hypertrophy is difficult/impossible anyway) rather train for strength (lower rep ranges) then? "
3657,What lifts shouldn't I do with a posterior labrum tear?,"I have a posterior labral tear. What lifts shouldn't I do with it? Can I do curls, pull ups, triceps extentions,  pullovers... etc? I have been benching on the floor, as I hear the elbow shouldn't go behind the back with the tear. "
3658,Bulking up in a 2 month time span,"This will be my first post on Fitness Stackexchange but I am very familiar with this great website (you may remember me from the Mathematics forums).  Well, I have 2 months before I leave for my home country of Italy (I am currently in the US) and would love to bulk. I have never bulked before but I have always been working out and weight lifting and doing the standard Chest-Tri, Back-Bi etc routine. I try to eat a lot but I have always been ~ 135 lbs. I am very ""fit"" and have worked out for years and get stronger but I do not see any real size.  Stats:  ~ 135 lbs  5'8"" slim/ectomorph   I do not have enough reputation to upload some pictures but I would if I could :P  So my question is this:  What am I doing wrong? Not eating enough? Too much basketball? I do not take whey or mass gainers as they contain lots of sucralose and artificial flavoring but I am open to the idea if anyone can provide mass gainers without artificial stuff. What exercises should I be doing? Lastly, is it possible to bulk for 2 months? Or is that a long time?   Thank you so much in advance :) "
3659,Mileage increase after marathon,"I Average 40 miles per week for running and ramping up to a marathon I peak at 60 miles. After the marathon I take two weeks off.  The normal rule I go by is 10% for milage increases, but I am wondering how a base plays into that? Can I go back to 40 miles a week? How long and how fast can I go back to that? "
3660,Eating before/after an evening workout?,"If I'm working out in the evening (an hour of cardio at, say, 8pm-9pm), should I have dinner before or afterwards? What effects will it have on a) my workout if I eat beforehand and b) my recovery if I eat afterwards?  (If I were to eat before the workout, then I'd top up afterwards with a recovery drink of some sort – usually skimmed milk, yoghurt, blended banana, and Nesquick.) "
3661,"If I build up my muscles and then don't use them for a while, then will the ""build-up"" regress after a while?","And if so, is regression more powerful if I build up my muscles from, say, the 90th percentile to the 99th percentile as compared to from the 30th percentile to the 50th percentile? As in, is the ""regression"" faster for higher levels of buildup? "
3662,Do carbs make people sleepy?,"In general, do carbs make people sleepy? My wife and I started eating a little-to-no carb paleo diet about a week ago (lots of vegetables, fruits, meat), and we feel like we've already seen a change in our mood.  However, earlier today we decided to bake some sweet potatoes (lightly breaded in corn starch) because we love them, and they have more nutrients than your typical starchy food. A couple hours after eating them, my wife's stomach kept making noises (like a loud gurgle every couple minutes for a half hour), and she's feeling out of it and tired.   I'm curious, is this a typical reaction to carbs or starchy foods? We're definitely not planning on eating too many of them, but it was alarming to see her sudden change in mood and constant stomach noises. "
3663,What should your calendar be AFTER you get done with Rushfit?,"We made it all the way through Rushfit advanced calendar. Now where do we go?  We would like to stay with the same workouts that are on the calendar.  Should we start over at the last 2 months, 1 month? Create a whole new calendar based on the last month?   What have all of you done after completing it? We just want to stay at the same or a little higher intensity that the calendar gave us, and stay in shape. "
3664,Is this an effective military PRT training plan?,"The military PRT, Physical Readiness Test, requires one to do a minimum number of pushups and situps followed by a 1.5 mile run.  I'm a good runner, so the main concern is my weak upperbody.  A month ago I could barely do 10 consecutive pushups.  Now I can do five sets of 10, which feels like good progress.  However, I want to train harder.    After educating myself, I know I need to incorporate pullups for balanced muscles. Should I do these on the same day?  Also, can I follow my 'full' pushup workout (which leaves me maxxed out) with knees-down/""girl"" pushups? Or should I do more pushups throughout the day/before bed?   I'm living overseas and only have access to a poorly paved park for my runs. My jogs are followed by lunges, situps, and crunches.  I'm currently working out only three times a week with the belief that rest days will benefit me more than consecutive workouts.  I don't have access to equipment or a soft surface.  With that in mind, could you give me feedback?  Apologies in advance if the question isn't objective/specific enough. "
3665,"Help me balance my cardio, circuit-training, and weight lifting workouts","I've been off the horse for a few months now, but I'm ready to climb back on and in trying to make a schedule I'm remembering something that I've been confused about for a while. There are three ""regimens"" that I'm aiming to balance:   I ride a bike (for commuting) Bodyweight circuit routines (based heavily on this one) Freeweights (the exercises listed here, under ""What Exercises Should I Do?"" and the first bullet points under ""How Many Repetitions Should I Do?"") Swimming would be nice to fit in on occasion   My primary concern is over-training. I'm sure you're looking at that list and saying to yourself ""Just do fewer things, stupid"" - and that may be the way it has to be - but if there's a way to structure my workouts such that I can eat my cake and have it, too (and then actually eat cake later, obviously), that'd be killer.    Edit: Ah, yes, my workout goals. First, I'm a 5'1"", asthmatic male in his late 20's who is...   Trying to stay somewhere between 118 and 123 pounds (I'm slightly above that after a few months off, but we'll go ahead and label this ""weight maintenance."") Looking to improve strength, endurance, and overall health Not especially concerned with becoming ""ripped"" or ""bulking up""  "
3666,Lower back pain when stretching hamstrings,"I went to defence forces 4 months ago and have had intense training and stuff without no good physical base before.  Had to carry a 60 pound bag for miles on my back etc and now having lower back pain when doing stretches for hamstring.  It seems that joints do not hurt, and only lower back muscles. I googled around a little bit, and it seems like muscle imbalance? Like lower back muscles are not strong enough or something. I am not sure.  Can someone please help me with this problem? What could be wrong with me. "
3667,Standard names of common gym exercises,"In my gym, the trainer gives me a routine of 5 days with 6 exercises each, a total of 30 different activities. They don't come with pictures but names, and I have difficulties recognizing which exercise corresponds to each name in the routine sheet. This probably sounds like a minor thing, but to me it is not:   It's embarrassing to keep asking the professor which machine or exercise to do.    Each gym has different names for same exercise? It confounds me.   I imagine there are hundreds of possible exercises. But it would be good to know of these things:   A standard or official naming convention, or an advised naming guide.   Helpful hints on what certain words mean, namely: what is ""press""?  "
3668,How can proper form be determined?,"When learning a new exercise, it's a good idea to learn ""proper form"" to reduce the chances of injury, increase efficiency, etc. It's usually recommended to ""run with proper form"", ""perform a bench press with proper form"", or ""climb with proper form"". However, there is a lot of conflicting information regarding what proper form actually is for any given exercise. It seems like everyone has a different idea of what proper form actually is.  So, given that there are multiple ways to do any exercise, how can I verify that I'm doing things the best way possible, and not in person X's favorite but unverified way? Is there an independent body that produces scientific information on this topic? "
3669,How often and how long should yoga be practiced for optimal health benefit?,"Yoga is a very varied way of exercise -- e.g., doing Surya Namaskar many times will of course improve one's stamina; most of the yoga asanas will build both strength and flexibility; some will help to develop a better sense of balance.  (Compare these questions: ""What are the health benefits of Yoga?"" and ""What are the best benefits of yoga (versus cardio and weight training)?"")    As mentioned in the answer to ""Which daily exercise are helpful to maintain health for long?"", there are certain recommendations the American Health Association gives regarding how often one should work on certain aspects of fitness, like moderate cardiovascular training should be done almost every day (5 days a week), while high-intensity muscle-strengthening is recommended only 2 times a week.  How does yoga fit into that picture?  Considering that yoga is in itself a kind of ""cross-training"", how often and how long would one do yoga asanas, in order to improve overall health in the sense the AHA recommends?  In what way can one's yoga practice be adapted to meet such recommendations, for instance by leaving some strengh-intensive asanas out for a few days, especially if yoga is practiced on a daily basis?  More specifically, are there any studies or otherwise noteworthy recommendations on how to arrange one's yoga practice in order to improve overall long-term health (compared to just getting better at doing the yoga exercises as an end in itself, as discussed in this question)? "
3670,Stretches to help recovery after weight lifting,"I've read that stretching after a session of weight lifting can help with recovery time.   Is this true? It seems counter-intuitive to me as any real weight lifting session will result in micro-tears in the muscle fibers. I can see how things like ice baths or contrast showers can help reduce inflammation, prevent or reduce DOMS and thus decrease the recovery time but I cannot see how stretching already damaged muscles will help. I would be very interested if someone could explain the underlying physiological mechanism here. If a stretching post workout is beneficial what are some recommended stretches and methods? Should they be executed any differently to emphasize recovery for weight lifting versus recovery from running or just general flexibility?      For reference I have (what I think is) a pretty standard twice a week two day split routine with about five minutes of fast walking for warm-up and cool-down. I warm up for the compound exercises (the presses, squats, and deadlifts by doing a set at 50% of my target weight).  Upper Body:   Bench Press  Lateral Raise Flys  Upright Row  Bent-Over Row  Dips  Deadlift   Lower Body:   Squats Incline Leg Press Plank Side-Plank Sit-ups  "
3671,Elliptical trainer for home use: Concerns about noise,"My question is about how quiet an elliptical trainer is in use in a home setting.  Background  My wife and I jog irregularly but really enjoy it when we do get out.  We find it tough in the winter in the UK because we both work full time and there are only around 8 hours of sunlight in the UK at this time of year!  We're considering buying an elliptical trainer to complement our irregular jogging.  We've been thinking of the best time to fit in some regular cardio exercise and before work at around 6am and after work at around 9 pm are the times we have free.  My concerns are:   Waking up the wife if I exercise at 6am Annoying the neighbours if we exercise at 9pm   Proposed location  We live in a semi-detached house and the room I'm considering putting it in is on the ground floor.  There are solid brick/concrete walls between our house and the next.  Ours and the neighbours bedroom are on the first and second floor so are a reasonable distance away from where the trainer would be.  Proposed equipment  I'm considering a Vision Fitness X6100 HR Folding Elliptical.  According to their website ""Additionally, they may work out in the early morning or late evening and do not want to disturb others. Vision Fitness is aware of this and, therefore, developed our Quiet-Glide™ drive technology, which utilizes a multi-ribbed supersilent Poly-V belt, to ensure an extra-quiet workout.""  Vision Fitness elliptical trainers - Quiet  The above sounds great, but I'm not one to believe the marketing claims without some real-world recommendations.  Summary of the question   How realistic is it that I can work out on the ground floor in the morning whilst my wife stays soundly asleep on the second? Will our neighbours hate us if we use the trainer at 9pm or will it be no worse from a noise point of view than say watching TV in the next room?   Any advice on this matter would be welcomed. "
3672,Is this heart rate too high for a beginner runner?,"I am a 38 year-old male beginner runner with a history of sport in my earlier years (but hated running by itself), I started the C25K program in mid-december to try to get some fitness back in after having 2 kids.    Back story:  I got to Week 7 with no issues, and tried to find a comfortable pace that isn't pushing too hard (at least I thought) but without being too shuffle-along either.  I felt comfortable, tried to follow the info I'd read about keeping at a pace that could still talk (though I wouldn't be giving long winded discussions probably).  I'm not trying to kill myself, just find a rhythm that is comfortable. Certainly a challenge, but I never felt exhausted, always feeling like I could have kept going a bit more than the current program phase.     My resting heart rate measured first thing in the morning dropped from 62 at the start of the program to 49-50, blood pressure's gone down from 130/80 to 122/74 so that's good. Generally feeling really good about everything, I run 3 times per week and ensure I'm giving myself good rests between runs.  I'm 38, 6'8"" but probably still 10kg over my ideal weight.  My Max heart rate is ~182 according to the usual calculation methods.  a 70-80% is 142-156.  I didn't have a HR monitor earlier on so just tried to listen to my body and not stress it out but keep on running.  In Week 7 Run 2 I got my Wahoo Heart Rate Monitor (sort of as a present to myself).  Week 7 is running starting 25 minutes non-stop, so it was my second non-stop run.    During the initial warm up fast-walk, my HR was 130.  Just After I started running my usual pace the HR monitor reported 164bpm.  It remained steady near this until I went up a hill and went up to 170.  This is in the 80-90% range. The peak for the entire run was 174 on the steepest spot.      Average HR for the entire run, including a 5 minute warm up walk, and cool down is 158.  Heart rate recovery after 2 minutes was 150, and reduces steadily.  Within the 2 minutes I'm breathing totally normally again.  I thought with this HR I was might be running too fast (not that I thought I was), so the next run, a 28 minute one, I tried to go as slow as I could.  Practically no change in HR measurements.  By the end of the run I was certainly a bit fresher than I had been and could easily pickup the pace near the end but no change in HR.    Obviously as a beginner runner, my body is going to have to adjust, and it's naturally going to be under some stress as the program develops, indeed it's the little bits of stress that is going to encourage it to improve.  I don't know how to slow down much more than I'm going without just resorting to walking phases.  My body feels totally fine, I'm enjoying the running, it's a good challenge without being crazy I feel.  Question:  Is my HR too high here?  What can I do different?  A friend of mine who does some long run's and has done a marathon just cautioned me not to run too hard, because it can train the heart 'the wrong way'.  With only 2 runs to go to complete the C25K I'm ready to keep going and go through the bridge program to 10k.  I'm not after speed, just good exercise and some fresh air and some endurance building.  I'm feeling good.  Here's my Runkeeper activity summary pic: [website]I have a regular running route which is a nice series of left turns around the block which avoids crossing at traffic lights.  It has some hills though, maybe the hills are where the major HR issue is, if I can find a flatter spot I'm pretty sure I could stay in the 164-169 range easily (though that is still 80-90%).  Any advice appreciated.   "
3673,Am I taking too many vitamins and supplements?,"I'm hoping to get some insight on the vitamins and supplements I'm taking. I'm afraid I'm taking too many or taking them incorrectly. Am I doing myself good or harming my body?  First off, I am 21, about 5'9, 140 lbs, low body fat, and athletic. I work out almost everyday now trying to prepare myself for USAF basic training. I'm trying to build muscle as well.  Now, as for vitamins and supplements, I am taking:   a Mega Man sport multivitamin a childrens vitamin Calcium/magnesium tab Flax seed oil (1 or 2) Mercury free fish oil (2) Nitric oxide (2, only before workouts) Bromelian (pineapple enzyme) 1-2 Whey protein shakes Creatine   I also just started DHEA tonight and bought L-Arginine as well, which I haven't tried yet.  I take these 6 days a week, plenty of fluids, and eat decently. I must admit I feel great and energized, good moods, etc. since starting this. I feel better than I have in a long time. There are no signs of harm, no urine symptoms, no bowel symptoms or anything. I've compared the ingredients of each label to each other too so I realize that the nitric oxide and arginine are similar as well as vitamin similarities.  Am I benefiting as much as I think I am, or am I causing unknown damage? "
3674,"weight/bodyweight training and some of its ""negative"" side effects","I have been doing weight lifting and body weight training for 1.5 years. I had to stop for a whole month (last month) due to overload of work.  Even though exercising feels good when you do it, and releases the good hormones and raises adrenaline, I noticed that during the month when I stopped I became calmer when confronted with external irritation (like a fight or anything that triggers adrenaline).  However, I restarted training a week ago (like 6 days a week) and doing a balanced yet strict diet, and I feel over-energetic to the point where if something triggers my self defense system, I would quickly and more easily irritated than when I had stopped training.  Is it because of the levels of testosterone that increase when training? Do you get more aggressive when you train constantly? "

3676,How did I lose weight now?,"How am I losing weight now?  so, when I started working out, I went from a 44 inch waist to a 39.5, with a weight loss from 92 to 87 kgs. Ever since that, I pretty much quit working out. Whenever I did workout, it was not serious and got my heart beating barely enough. Eventually, I thought I was doomed to be fat and could not lose weight no matter what I did.  So, recently I went aboard. While I was there, I noticed my jeans were slightly loose now. I chose to ignore the fact until later. When I came back, I started drinking green tea. Its been about 62 days since I came back. I took green tea every day at about an average of 3 cups. Then later on I have purchased a treadmill. It has been 42 days since I've been running on it, and now my waist is 33.7.   Why wasn't I able to lose this weight before? Was there something wrong with my metabolism? "

[website]I would like to ask how should I prepare to run a 26.21 mile marathon on an elliptical machine. So far I have done up to 2/3 in 3 hours, not feeling any knee/ankle pain, which is the reason why I am doing this in the elliptical machine and not a road marathon.

3679,Wanting to lose weight cycling is this enough?,"I had the opportunity to live in Antigua for 2.5 months and I got here about 2.5 weeks ago. I decided to ride my bike back and forth to work everyday to shed some pounds while I am here. I am a 5'3"", 140 lbs, and in good, general health.  The path I take is a dirt road with some small elevations throughout (enough to have me consider walking every time I go up them. :) The path is about 1.5 miles and it takes me about 12 min to get to work and 16 min to come back as it is uphill. I don't coast when going downhill, I pedal down. I have a well-balanced diet with all food groups but I try not to go over 1200-1300 calories a day.   Do you think this  is enough to lose some weight or should I be adding something to my routine like strength training, or more cardio, or more bike rides? Any insight would be greatly appreciated. Also, I have been doing this for 2.5 weeks and the ride is not getting any easier... is this normal? I thought it would be a breeze by now, and I don't know if I have lost any weight yet because I don't have a scale here but I assume I lost a few pounds because my legs and belly look tighter... "

3683,How far can you go with eccentric body exercises?,"Oops! This got longer than what I have intended, so please bear with me!  Let me start off by saying that it's the first time I see a website about fitness where I can hope of receiving empirical answers, instead of the usual knuckle-dragging ones!  I'm no stranger to fitness, gyms and bodybuilding (although not as sharp as I would like to be on the biological side of things), and have great experience with all considering that in the last 4 years I've transformed into an excellent, healthy physique. However, it is only recently that I've been trying to pin down the most efficient ways of inducing muscular hypertrophy. The internet mostly brought up anecdotal or commercially-influenced evidence, and most papers I've found have been contradictory to one another.  This led me to turn to auto-experimentation. Each month I would pick a different workout routine and log my results. However, since measuring actual muscle gain is not feasible, the only things I measured were the amounts of soreness I would receive the following day. In other words, my evidence is unreliable.  A few months ago I encountered this paper published by BRAD J. SCHOENFELD, wherein it explains possible variables that affect muscle growth. To summarize, among many factors, the most practical and relevant seem to be:   Total damage afflicted to the muscle. Amount of metabolic stress during workout. Duration of mechanical tension in the muscle.   To my understanding, the best way to afflict muscular damage is slow, eccentric movements, therefor allowing assorted fibers to ""slip and get torn off"" as they extend, as illustrated here:    The best example of doing so is rapidly going UP in a push up, then ever-so-slowly descending down to earth.  All things considered, I composed a routine: a repeating loop of extremely slow descending, fast ascending push ups until relative exhaustion (usually around half a dozen) followed by an extremely slow descending, fast ascending squats. Repeated indefinitely. Note that there is NO time to rest in between, although after trying this I sometimes give myself 30 to 60 seconds if I feel especially exhausted.  After a week of waiting, I began this workout. On the first day, I experienced my muscles shaking towards 30 minutes, which is normal after that time of not working out. After I started to automatically drop in the squat section from my legs feeling like noodles, I called it a day. Total workout of around 40 minutes.  In the next day I felt soreness which you feel after not exercising for a while or for the first time. I skipped this day and the day after it.  4th day, felt no muscle shakes towards the end, and eventually stopped due to limbs feeling like noodles after about an hour. On the next day, I felt soreness, yet very marginal and unlike the one described previously.  I would like people to take shots at disassembling and disproving my understanding and practice, there are a lot of questions, so I guess it would turn into a discussion or a long answer list. I've heard a lot of talk that you cannot gain muscle (or at least not as much) from only bodyweight exercises, and I must disagree, simply because my half year at the gym was as mundane as my years doing bodyweight exercises. Overall, to clarify, I am always making progress, I am simply always looking to make it more efficient.  Questions:   Are periods of rest between sores necessary at all? How does working out day after day hamper hypertrophy? Is it advisable to skip the concentric contraction part of the push up/squat routine by using external help, and only relying on eccentric workouts? (slowly descending down, using external help to get up, repeat...) Is my thought model for inducing damage to the muscle optimal? How much of a wild card is the so-called ""metabolic stress"" from the paper I mentioned? Anyone have any experience or thoughts? My primary work outs include push ups, squats, pull ups and/or chin ups, and lastly, sprinting. I've been doing these for the last year and a half and witnessed a great increase in muscular size. Pretty void, but can anyone suggest anything to improve?   Looking forward for answers! Sorry for the lengthy post and any pretentiousness that might have leaked! It would be wonderful if answers would be constructed biomechanically, rather than hocus pocus mike chang anecdotes. "

3686,Macro ratios accuracy,"I've gained 30lbs this year by eating a lot and training a lot. Now I want to put on another 20lbs by the end of the year. To be sure that I'm not increasing my body fat percentage, I'm trying to plan meals carefully.  When I enter my weight, age, and activity level into some of these online macro calculators, it spits out different amounts of macros depending on whether or not I want to gain or maintain:  Gain: 149g protein 113g fats 445g carbs ~52% total calories: 3,389  Maintain: 165g protein 99g fat 354g carbs ~47% total calories: 2,965   I understand the general role of carbs in providing energy, and protein in building muscle... but I'm curious about:  1) Why the ratios change a little between Gain vs Maintain  2) Are these amounts determined through objective, scientific means? Or is this method just a ""best guess"" because of the debates over carbs vs fat / the meaning of a ""calorie"" / etc? "
3687,Very overweight person trying to get fit,"I'm very overweight, 6'1, 142 kgs (313 pounds) 36 years of age. I had a work accident a few years ago and never really got active after and then I felt too ""big"" to exercise but I want to fight that mentality.   Other issues:  I also have asthma and I find sometimes that causes issues. I have achilles tendinitis that can flare up occasionally.  When I ran today, the balls of my feet hurt the most, and now as I sit, I feel sore all over (which I can work through).  I tried to run today at a track (just got a membership) and the most I was able to run was 200 metres without getting winded/feet aching beyond tolerance. I ended up alternating 200 metres jogging, then running, so I ended up doing 2000 metres at 26 minutes.  I have a goal of being able to run 4k in 20 minutes to start. Will it be possible for someone in my situation to be able to do this say in 90 days? What are some of the things I have to look at to prevent injury, etc?  Finally, I don't know how to swim but I'm learning. Will swimming as an exercise improve my ability to run longer distances? I have a friend in my swim class who runs 15km every morning but he gets winded very quickly swimming.. will the same hold true in reverse?  I've looked at questions such as:  What should i do to run 6 miles in 1 hour  Edit: I'm going to keep track of my daily runs and will try to record my daily caloric intake as well.  Edit 2: I mentioned this in a comment but I figured I'd put it up here as well: This is the inspiration behind this effort: [website]  At 3 o’clock that morning, Jake ran about a tenth of a mile, walked   another four tenths, and said he felt like he was going to die. The   next day, he watched the interview another 30 times and did the same   thing.      A couple weeks later, he could jog the full half-mile without   stopping. A couple months after that, he completed a five-mile race.   Edit 3: Went for my second run. The pain on the outside of my feet is worse than the fatigue itself. Will try to get better running shoes (currently using Asics Duomax). However I do know that I have wide flat feet so I'm not sure what good selection there is for this. "

3689,Incorporating kettlebell exercises into an existing workout plan,"I've been working through Ripptoe's Starting Strength and Practical Programming books and training schedule, mostly aiming for basic fitness and building muscle mass. My current workout is mostly squats, deadlifts, bench &amp; standing presses, and a few variations on the plank. True to the full title of starting strength, both of these books focus almost exclusively on barbell training. I've found that I was able to incorporate dumbbells into my workout as necessary (particularly for the standing press). I've recently begun simply playing with the kettlebell - not really using it as part of my workout, just getting to know the basic exercises and motions. So far it seems to me that barbells are typically used for increasing core strength, and dumbbells are typically used for targeted muscle group workouts.  My questions are twofold:   Is there a ""typical use"" for kettlebells? Given my goals (fitness &amp; muscle mass increase), are there any kettlebell exercises that would better suit me than   "
3690,"Is there any point to doing Intermittent Fasting, while working out in the morning and having a serving of Pre-Workout?","I recently learned that consuming pre-workout (LIT AF) and water will indeed break my fast.    For the past 2 weeks, I have been waking up early to go get a early morning lift (Push, pull, legs is my usually 3 day routine).  While after a workout, I will opt out of eating until 2:00pm, and finish my feasting at 10:00pm.    Since taking pre-workout at 6:30am will technically break my fast, is there any point for me to fast until 2:00pm or should I just go ahead and eat after my workout?    Will there be any benefit to this?  I realize coffee is a solution instead of pre-workout but I like the focus and energy I get from pre-workout.  It also gets me motivated in the morning to go to the gym.   "
3691,How to do overloaded closed-kinesthetic-chain pushups without a spotter?,"Muscle &amp; Fitness says      Most chest and shoulder closed-chain exercises aren't practical for   developing strength, so these routines substitute the incline barbell   press and barbell overhead press. (emphasis mine)   Yet, a small lady friend sitting on my back while doing push ups works well, gets a nice burn, and feels pretty cool. Now, how to do this without a spotter/partner/lady friend?

3692,Explaining the difference in nutritional information between very similar bags of rice or beans,"At the store, bags of different types of rice or beans are sold by a number of companies.  For a particular type (e.g. black beans), the companies will all usually list the same nutritional information.  However, a few companies will occasionally have a variation in the number of calories of the amount of protein, with everything else remaining the same, including the serving size.  Is that information the result of laboratory work?  Is there a way to explain why a few companies would list slightly different information? "
3693,Worthwhile to cross-train while preparing for half-marathon,"I will be running a half-marathon in two and a half months. This will be the third half marathon I've run. I hope to run it in under two hours; my previous best is just under 2:08. My resting heart rate is 52.  Because of winter street and trail conditions where I live, my training for this half marathon has all been on a treadmill. I do distance, speed, and incline work. A friend suggested that I should cross-train. Lift weights, swim, or something other than simply running five days a week on a treadmill.  Is there any scientific evidence that cross-training will help my half-marathon performance? More specifically, is there any evidence that spending half an hour on swimming, lifting weights, or some such, would be more beneficial than spending that half hour on a treadmill? I accept that cross-training may help my overall fitness, but I am only asking about half-marathon performance. "
3694,"Warming up and ""Greasing the groove"" method","""Greasing the groove"" or GtG is a training method developed by Pavel Tsatsouline, and made popular through his book 1999 ""Power to the People! : Russian Strength Training Secrets for Every American.""   How do warming up fits into this system?   If you do several sets of pull-ups (or push-ups or whatever single exercise you'll try to optimize), are you supposed to do a proper warm up every time? Or it's OK to skip warm up, but then be extra slow?  From a purely pragmatic point of view, it seems extremely difficult to fit in warm-ups every time you decide to perform your push-ups. "
3695,General stretches for a group of dancers?,"I do modern dancing and my teacher asked me to lead the warm-up / stretch for the other students before class starts.

Something that could benefit everyone without causing injury? "
3696,Workout routine for 5 days a week,"I understand that working consecutive days without rest isn't ideal because it doesn't give your muscles enough time to repair themselves, but what if your daily workouts isolate particular muscles? Shown below is the workout routine I am currently using:   Monday: chest and back (mostly push-up and pull-ups) Tuesday: biceps (isolated bicep curls) Wednesday: chest, shoulders and triceps (lots of compound shoulder/tri/chest exercises) Thursday: legs and back (mostly squats/lunges/raises) Friday: biceps and triceps (mix of isolated and compound bi/tri exercises)   This workout gives me room to improve the areas that are underdeveloped (chest/arms) and simultaneously improves the supporting muscles (back/shoulders). My legs are already at their ideal level, so once a week of maintenance / small growth is all I need for them.  It seems that each muscle group would have a day (or more) of rest before their next workout, but I am no expert so I may be overlooking something. Would this routine be counterproductive due to my muscles not getting enough rest between workouts?  Note: I am considering this routine because I don't have much time in my daily schedule to fit in three large workouts each week, so instead I want to do 5 smaller (15-20 minute) workouts that I can do at work while on break.

3699,"I really just want to cut and lose weight, while lifting, what should my expectations be?","So I have to drop a little bit of some back story and a stat or two to give some context.  I'm a small-ish dude, 5'8, nothing special, and weighed 180lb when I really tried to jump start my ""fitness as a lifestyle"" (aka lifting weights just to stay moderately healthy), I did okay, nothing impressive, but for a completely natural dude who didn't really do anything special with diet except just eat a bit more at home and a lot less out on the go, I shed some weight, got down to 159lb, but I know I needed to lose more since my stomach still wasn't completely flat yet. I did StrongLifts 5x5 which was completely new to me at the time, got up to a 250 lb 5x5, and then, at my job where the gym was at, the gym closed for the winter holiday(it was a college). I took the time off from the gym(big mistake), etc, etc, fast forward a year + later, and now I'm back, put on a few extra pounds, and am just annoyed by having to start all over again.  One of my most annoying hurdles is whenever I drop out of going to the gym and try to jump back into things, I get kind of depressed easily when the weights don't really fly up. I was never a guy squatting 4 plates, so it's not like I'm dropping down from 405lb squats to 3 250lb and ""getting back into it"", it's more of like, I'm dropping from a measly max of 250lb squats to 135lb or even less, depending on how I feel. And it just sucks because I'm like sore af for the first few weeks, and I'm not really sure if I should just jump straight back into the StrongLifts methodology of adding weight each work out. Should I take a few weeks to just ""warm back up"" into everything? Or is it okay to just hit it hard?  So here's the thing. I've been an overweight guy my whole life. Not overweight by relatively -that- much, but still overweight, never had a great aesthetic, etc, etc. I just want to be thin and fit well in clothes, have a flat stomach, maybe abs one day. But what I really am not interested in is bulking, adding on tons of mass, squatting 4-5 plate, etc. I mean squatting 3 plate for me would probably be a great achievement and one I'd be completely content with if I was a skinny dude that didn't focus on ""bulking"" or ""eating over maintenance"", and all of that other stuff. I know a friendly who literally just eats everything in sight because he's ""on a bulk"". The guy squats 405lb 1RM but he's also like 6'2.. Frankly, I really can't stand the idea of eating just to eat or bulking, and, I know what you're thinking, it's ironic given my current status. I just admit that I've made poor life style choices that lead me to this state. I just want to cut and get thin, get rid of these b!tch tits, etc. I do not want to bulk, I don't want to be the next popular power lifter, or anything like that.  So, I guess what I'm trying to figure out is, are lifting programs like StrongLifts and Sheiko's destined to set me up for failure when my goal is to be ""perpetually cutting"" or just being at less or around maintenance calories? I find that when I try to cut and diet for real on programs like StrongLifts that I just don't have the energy to knock out all the 5x5s day in and day out, adding weight daily, resting only 60-90 seconds. And this just takes a mental toll because, like I said, I'm not really pushing that much weight at all. What kind of advice can you guys give me for lifting, as far as intensity, volume, or programs are concerned, that will help keep my sanity and central nervous system in check, to where I can achieve my goals of just becoming a thin, normal body weight dude, but won't also completely tire my brain out in the gym? I'm just not sure if I should just keep it simple with stronglifts, and just cater it to my needs. Would cardio be a better way for me to achieve my goals?  Hope this all makes sense. Sorry for the livejournal entry. "
3700,How should I proceed to get normal weight?,"My height is around 174.8 cm and weight is around 55 Kgs.  The problem is, I wasn't under weight when I was around 14-15 years old. Now I'm 26 years old. I never paid attention to it until after entering 20s.   I guess the possible reason for this is my stress about life, loneliness, thinking too much about future and not eating much. I maybe wrong though.  Now, I read many answers regarding weight gain here.  Most of them ask: Do you need muscle gain (build muscle) or just weight (fat)?  Thing is, I look weak. My legs and hands are thin. My cheeks are concave (I don't know exact word for it. I mean cheeks are pushed inside instead of most people. Hope you understand it). Sometimes when strong wind is blowing and I'm walking, I feel the force is pushing me.  So I don't understand when you ask muscle gain or weight gain or fat etc.  I just know that I'm not fit in terms of weight and I want to be fit/normal.  So Q.1 To be fit in terms of weight, (so I don't look skinny and become like other people of my age), do I need muscles or fat or something else? (I need answer of it so I can proceed further)  Q.2 For some reasons, I can't join gym and can't buy equipment. I can only eat and do exercises without equipment in home. Does squat work to gain weight? What is proper way to do squat? Is it different from sit down and get up thing?  If you need more information, kindly mention in the comments.  PS: Which answers can I read on this website to gain weight, once I understand how should I proceed?  EDIT: You may want to read my comments on 1st answer here, if you need further explanation regarding what kind of fitness/shape I need and what I lack. "
3701,Stronglifts 5x5 or Pure Chest workout?,"I just lost around 35 pounds of fat and now I'm looking towards building some muscle for the summer. I'm 5 11 and around 172 pounds. I've been looking around for some information and I've narrowed my options down to two programs. My goals are primarily to gain some muscle around my chest area; basically have more defined pecks and lose fat around my stomach area and make my stomach area more harder. Better defined biceps are triceps would also be great but not the main focus here. I was focused on Stronglifts 5x5 for a while and it seems like a great program, however I've been hearing that it is more geared towards gaining strength and not necessarily towards gaining a more defined look. The other program that I've found is the following:   [website]The program seems like what I want to do really but I don't know if Stronglifts 5x5 can provide me the same results. I'd rather go with Stronglifts 5x5 simply because of the app and more easier schedule. What would you recommend for me? How about something like Stronglifts 5x5 one day, then rest then pure chest workout and rest and so on and so forth? "

So, my question is: How do I increase my stamina?  The obvious answer would seem to be ""do something tiring, and do as much of it as possible"". But do I want the highest possible intensity, or the longest duration? Do I want one continuous block of exercise, or lots of short bursts with rest in between? I'm not really sure where to start with this...    A little background, in case it helps:   By ""dancing"", I do not mean a casual waltz. (Although if you do it properly, a waltz actually uses far more energy than you might imagine, just so you know.) I'm talking about jumping up and down, kicking your legs above your head, waving your arms in the air, at devestatingly high speed. Sometimes I even get to lift my dance partner clean off the ground. I can do all of this - just not for very long. So it's not that I need more strength or flexibility or coordination. The only thing I am missing is stamina. I have been dancing for over 3 years now. When I say ""I'm not getting fitter"", I'm not saying that after just two sessions. I'm saying that after years of effort. After all that, there are people twice my age dancing rings around me.     In case I was whaffling too much:  My question basically boils down to ""do I want a small burst of intense activity, or a large burst of moderate activity?"" "
3703,What is the effect of carb consumption on fat burning during exercise?,"I do a fair amount of cycling over what some would consider long distance - ~40 mile rides every 2-3 weeks and shorter rides more frequently.  I have to consume a fair quantity of high GI carbs while on the bike or I will most certainly Bonk somewhere round the 120 minute mark.  What I would like to understand is how this consumption affects fat burning.  How does the body ""select"" what energy sources to draw on while exercising.  Does the exercise trigger the body to continually burn fat (and everything else it can find), or is low blood glucose needed to force this?   Please note this is NOT a generic fat loss question. I'm not looking for ""how to maximise fat loss"".  I'm looking to understand the science.  From what I've read the heart rate during exercises is linked to the proportion of calories drawn from glycogen and fat.  I've seen significant disagreement about weather this means fat burning drops off at high heart rates or not.  But lets presume for the sake of argument that I'm exercising at a rate which does burn significant quantities of fat.  It's also understood that taking in carbs during very long rides will increase endurance by allowing your body to burn the carbs you're eating / drinking before burning the glycogen and thus increase the time before glycogen is depleted.  What I'm really asking here is whether the carbs I eat during the ride affect fat burned and glycogen burned evenly (leaving the proportions unchanged).  Or does or is this affect asymmetric?  Does it significantly affect one more than the other and thus change the proportions? "
3704,10% sugar in berries -- what's the rest?,"According to packages on frozen berries (e.g. raspberry, blueberry and others), 10g out of 100g consists of sugar, 1g of other carbohydrates, and 0-1g of protein. What about the rest? Is it just water? "
3705,In PPL why is twice the amount of sessions dedicated to the smaller limbs?,"In a Push, Pull, Legs workout program, why do the arms get two days training whereas the legs only get a single day.   The arms are far smaller than the legs so shouldn't there be less emphasis on them? Wouldn't it make more sense to split the legs up over two days, such as upper and lower, or leg push/leg pull or something, and then give one day to arms? "
3706,How to take care of the hurting shoulder joint?,"I think I've hurt my right shoulder. I don't know what caused it but it is painful. I noticed it today while taking bath. I clean my back by applying soap with my hands somewhat like this:    I when I do whats shown above, with my left hand, my fingers reach my right spine of scapula. But when I try to do the same with my right hand, it hurts in the shoulder joint. This is the only motion (orientation of right hand) in which its hurting. That is the reason why it went unnoticed in the gym. I don't do any such motion in the gym.  What to do? What should I avoid in the gym? How to cure it? "
3707,"What's the difference between gaining weight by muscle gain and by fat gain, for an underweight person?","You may want to read my this question to have some more info. Because this question arised from there.  Now, I have a self made belief (I can be wrong) that muscle gain is for people who are already healthy, have healthy weight according to their age and height. For example, in movies, heroes are not underweight and hence they make muscles/six packs.  So how can you make muscles when you don't have enough weight and strength? First you need basic weight, and you should be a normal person with healthy weight. Am I right?  Secondly, when you're underweight (55 Kgs weight, 175 cm height, 26 age), should you go for muscle gain or fat gain?  According to my belief, I should not go for muscle gain.  So what's the truth and information that I am missing?  Normal = Most people of my age who are not under weight and are not underweight even they don't have six packs and good muscles as heroes in movies have. "
3708,Pendlay Row: It doesnt connect the lats,"This is a part of the StrongLift 5*5 Program, where one workout is Squats, Bench Press, Pendlay Row and the other is Squats, OHP and Deadlift.The weight increases by 5 pounds on every workout.  While doing the pendlay row I noticed that I am basically rowing with my arms and as the weight was a bit heavier for me, I felt a twitch in the lower back too. had to leave it after 4 reps in the last two sets. Another problem is, no one at my gym knows about these rows so no one can check my form, all they say is this is bad for your lower back, stop doing it.  How can I improve my row technique myself so it connects better? Or is there any alternative that I can fit into this program from my back development? "
3709,What to eat before and after gain weight workout?,"I want to gain weight, but im confused what to eat before and after exercise(gain weight).Can someone name healthy foods or snacks? And also do i need to eat more on before or after exercise? Also want to know if its advisable to exercise early in the morning? "
3710,Could a specific nutrient deficiency cause lightheadedness when losing weight?,"I'm currently using the Slow Carb Diet to lose some weight. I find that it works well, but I plateau often. I'm trying (and succeeding but ever so slowly) to get under 15% body fat. Been doing it a while and it's fine.   I find that if I'm dropping weight I get light-headed. Well, it's not really the same feeling as ""must eat now"" so I'll call it 'fuzz-headed'. For instance, on cheat day (Sat), I'll feel fine. Likewise Sunday. But by Thursday (today) I feel sorta light headed / spacy / fuzzy. I'd say it is similar to being half hung over, half low blood sugar.   Important note: I doubt it's blood sugar. I've tested my blood sugar (with a strip kit) about 8 times when I've had this feeling and it's always been in the 95-130 range. My appetite doesn't seem to have anything to do with it -- my hunger levels are usually pretty low when I'm experiencing this fuzz-head feeling. Also, I don't think it's hydration, judging by urine color. I drink about 48oz of water (coffee, tea) between 7AM and 5PM and never feel thirsty. I have talked to a Dr about this and he tested my blood... something... levels. Slightly elevated creatinine (sp?) but all else normal. He thought the creatinine wasn't anything to be concerned about.   A typical day looks like this:    7AM: protein shake, 45g protein, 16 oz water, flax seed after 7AM: 2 cups coffee, black 9:30AM: fuzzy headed feeling starts about her 10AM: breakfast: 4-6 oz pork or chicken, 1/2c lentils, 1/2c spinach, 2 eggs 2PM: lunch: 1.5c slow carb chili (kidney beans, beef, vegetables) 5PM: fuzzy headed feeling has been with me from 9:30 until now.    I've tried attacking this issue with vitamins (Vit D or a multivitamin), no effect. I do find it will go away if I get a solid half hour of aerobic activity like hill-walking or swimming. Large doses of caffeine will clear it up as well (20 oz coffee). I want to avoid caffeine because it disrupts my sleep. Getting an hour in at the gym in the morning is difficult.   My questions: could this be related to the weight loss? Like as I'm shedding fat there's some sort of byproduct that gets stuck in my blood and my kidneys aren't filtering it out well? Could this be a specific nutrient that I'm not getting enough of (esp. something that  a typical multi wouldn't take care of)?   I've asked about this on the SCD forums in the past but really didn't get a good answer. Hopefully the SE network will give me better results.  "
3711,"Benefits to sumo, intentional fat-building","What are the benefits, if any, to the diet, physical conditioning and body-engineering typically associated with sumo?  Can an individual intentionally build large amounts of fat in a way that could be considered responsible, healthy, and useful outside of this sport?  What are the limits to this? "
3712,Why does pulling up hurt my lats?,"I am starting to build my muscles again after a long time, but the problem I always encountered was that my lats start to hurt when trying to do a pull up.   What I do is to hang completely while not resisting to get to my starting position. Then i'll pull my shoulder blades together and try to have almost no bicep strength as much as possible as I try to pull myself up as to engage the correct muscle groups. But what happens here is that I feel my lats feel very stretched and I could attempt to force myself but I have a feeling my lats will rip. So I never push through with a single pull up. Am I doing the pull up wrong? Or does pull ups need some level of bicep engagement so it will not be redirected to the lats? "
3713,Information regarding dumbbell use for underweight person,"I'm an underweight person. I can't join gym neither I can buy expensive equipment. These Dumbbells seem worth my budget.  But I read at some sites that dumbbells are for making arms strong. So ultimately that will increase weight of arms only?  And if I am wrong, can I use them to increase my overall weight and gain a normal weight (I don't want to be muscular, just need normal weight)?  Secondly, for a person with 174 cm height and around 55-58 Kg weight, how much weight of dumbbells is recommended?  "
3714,Do front squats compress the spine?,"Just curious I regularly do 225 front squats and was wondering what are the long term effects on the spine with this exercise or any squats for that matter?   Since the bar is placed in the front and racked on the shoulders I always thought there was more pressure on the core to stabilize the body under load.  Will they significantly compress the spine long term or is the same amount of compression one experiences through out the day from standing/walking? If its the former, what type of stretches would be advised to decompress the spine?  "
3715,cardio before or after weights?,"145 pounds, 170cm tall, female. been doing cardio &amp; weight lifting for 2 months with good diet, goal is to lose body fat and gain muscle. what is the science behind doing weights before/after cardio? will it really affect my gains/weight loss either way? "

3717,Do I just have to forget about lifting weights?,"Started gym 2 months ago - 5 days a week (1 hour cardio, 1 hour weights).  145 pounds, 170cm, female.  I am eating a calorie deficit and realize my gains are only newbie gains..  I will forever be eating a calorie deficit as I cant see myself ever being happy with my body until I'm shredded as (eat about 1500 cals a day) so, when these newbie gains wear off, is it pointless me still lifting weights as it's impossible to gain muscle while in calorie deficit? or not pointless as it's important to maintain it?

3718,How does muscle confusion work?,I just found out about P90x and it seems they use the muscle confusion theory. But how does it work neurologically and as far as creating muscle mass is concerned? What would a typical routine be? Examples please.  Thank you. 
3719,Threshold consistency - how consistent is consistent enough?,"I'm running 5 minute repeats on a track, with a rest after each one of a minute, and I've been told to run them consistently, rather than going out fast on the first one and then getting increasingly slow over time.  If I'm aiming for 1:38 per lap of the track, what counts as 'consistent'? I suppose ideally you'd do every single lap at exactly 1:38, but that seems impossible (if nothing else, from inconsistent timing).  So how close should each lap be to the ideal lap time?  Is within 1 second good enough, or should I be more stringent?  Here's a graph of the last two times I did this; the first time is less consistent than the second (well, I did get consistently slower quicker the first time I attempted this) but I'm not sure where I should be aiming to tighten things up - when does it appear I stopped being consistent enough on the second attempt?   "
3720,Bodyweight strength training,"Normally I'd be following a typical freeweight strength training program, like Stronglifts 5x5, but lately I have found the necessity to go to a gym is a bit of a problem. Also, I will be leaving for some delegations at work in the following months, so going to a gym will be very inconvinient or even impossible.  Im thinking of switching to a bodyweight strength training program - that way I could exercise anywhere, anytime.   I want to replace a 5x5 program with bodyweight exercises  I want to reach the same goals doing 5x5 helps accomplish. I want to gain strength and overall fitness. Im also in the process of getting leaner, but thats what my diet takes care of.  But I have a few doubts about all this.   Is bodyweight training effective for strength and muscle gain?  Are there muscle groups that such a training plan does not properly adress?  Are bodyweight programs easy to adjust in terms of how hard they are, and is it easy to measure progress (like 2,5kg increments in 5x5)   Id be happy if you could provide me with a program that could fufill my expectations.  Ive read the bodyweight leg exercises for strength/hypertrophy question, but its far from being a complete answer for my question. "
3721,How many calories should I exactly eat for building body?,"The title is little ambiguous. But my situation puts that into context:  My weight 60kgs &amp; height 5'6"".  I've started weight training for body building for past 3 weeks. Its written every where to eat huge. So I started eating huge. My typical diet contains:  Chicken 150-200gms Rice 400-500gms Eggs 1-2 Milk 250ml Oil/Butter/Fat 30-40gms Some Vegetable (100gms) Multivitamin capsules (covers 30%-70% of different vitamins &amp; minerals) Calcium supplement (500mgx2)   This amounts to around 2800-3000 calories.  I work 3 days a week in gym (for 2-2.5hrs) and otherwise I just sit infront of desk (so other 4 days is strictly sitting at desk). Here is my workout of past 4 workout days: [website]Good thing is that, I've gained weight. My arms, chest, lats thighs (credit goes to squats) got bulked up. I'm happy but I've accumulated quite a bit of fat around my belly. Even though I've very thin body, I've quite a bit of fat around my abodmen, especially in lower abdomen area (hereditary). Now in this past 3 weeks this increased quite a bit.   This is raising doubts about my diet. Am I eating too much? Should I reduce my carbs? Am I eating enough? How many calories should I exactly eat for building body? Also because I'm not doing anything except sitting, during 4 days a week should I eat less during these rest days? "
3722,What effect does restricted oxygen in cardio have on muscle damage & repair?,"As we all know, cardio and strength training have completely different effects on your muscles, and your body's response to them. Strength training trains the body to make those big anaerobic muscle fibres, giving you the body-builder look, but cardio builds endurance muscles without hypertrophy. (Why does cardio/aerobic exercise lead to muscle loss? has a fuller explanation for anyone new to the site.)  When I swim, my breathing is restricted because of the water (let's say my technique is poor), so an intensity of exercise that's normally aerobic for me becomes anaerobic instead. I feel out of breath (the sign of an oxygen deficit) after a sprint that doesn't tire out my muscles: if I were on the bike instead, I'd be able to keep up that level of activity for hours.  So my question is this: how does an anaerobic exercise (my swim sprint) compare to an aerobic exercise of the same intensity (my bike ride)? I'm looking in particular for the effect it has on the muscle profile: the fat-burning effects are already covered by do low oxygen levels effect fat burn and/or muscle strengthening? and Does the amount of breathing (holding breath/breathing fast) affect the calories burned during a workout (not heavylifting)? "
3723,How quickly is a banana assimilated?,I've read up a little bit on the digestion of foods and understood that even the simpler foods (such as bananas that are very popular in sport nutrition) can take up to an hour to digest.  So my question is why is it that it is said that bananas give you immediate energy? Doesn't it still take an hour? Or is it that the simple fact that you eat food increases the release of some form of energy your body can use?  Could someone explain me in simple terms how a banana is converted in energy and how quickly that energy is made available to the body? 
3724,Best exercises to improve cardiovascular system in relation to calorie spent?,"The title says all, I'm a male, 5% body fat, 18 years smoker that is already struggling to eat enough to earn muscle with minimal fat gain on a clean bulk diet (relying on supplements only when can't fulfill my needs and no junk food) but I also practice martial arts and my cardiovascular system can't keep up to my necessities. I can get out of breath like when you run a lot just by doing legs or abs exercises and doing too much heavy exercises without rest between them.  So which exercises would have the best ratio of calorie spent to improvement on cardio measurements such as VO2 max?  Or in other words, which HIT will be the most ""hard"" to my heart and lungs with less calories spent?  I'm sure must be any studies, empirical evidence or hard data comparing the results of many HIT training methods, to see which is most effective?  Observations : Ideally I would like to spend at most 20-30 minutes for this 3-4 a week, the less the better.  Goals : My first goal is muscle growth. I'm on a gray area about working on muscle growth and fat control, and at same time improving my cardiovascular system, that's why I'm asking here, its essential to know things like to build a routine that's optimal according to my goals and desires and that is not at odds with others goals. I'll measure how long I can keep my heart rate at 80% and my V02 Max weekly. ( I appreciate any tips on better measurements I could use)  "

3726,Exercises to Tighten My Body During Weight Loss?,"I'm 25 years old and 173cm height. I was fat almost all my life until the age of 23 when I decided to lose fat. At that time I was 88 KG. Then in 6 months I lost until I became 72KGs. What I did was just diet with walking for 2 hours. However at that time I wasn't happy with the result of my body because I still saw ugly loose skin. But then my studies started and I got so busy with it. Because of stress I gained fat, so now I'm 77KGs. So I decided to go to the gym now and do one hour of cardio. I do intensive running on the machine for 1 hour (I run at 10K/h for 1.5 minute, and 0.5 minute walking at 5.5/K/h). I burn with this hour 600 calories. Of course I'm controlling my diet now. Not the same difficult diet that I did in the past, but I only reduced my food intake a little and cut sweets and sugar completely. I guess I eat around 2000 calories per day.  When I started training at the gym I was 78KG, now I'm 77KG after 1.5 week.  However I'm really concerned about the excessive/loose skin that I might get since my plan is to loose weight until I become 65 KGs. After that my plan is to start lifting weights to get a toned fit body (I read this question so I'm aware of it, but this is my goal). My biggest concern now is the loose skin. Can you please recommend for me excercises/machines to use to help me tighten my skin?  I need to note that in the gym we have those vibrating machines. A guy told me that these help to tighten the skin, so what do you think? "
3727,Pacing for run training plan,"So I am working on a half marathon training plan with a doable goal pace, but it will be a healty PR for me.  The plan that I am using has a chart for various paces at distances.  It's the Nike 1/2 marathon training plan that can be found here.  The pace chart is on page 8.  Given my current level of fitness using the half marathon goal pace, my mile and 5k times are a bit slow.  The 10K pace, I am unsure about, but what gets me is the recovery pace.  My typically recover pace is about 1 min per mile slower than what they are suggesting.   Is this a big deal?  Should I just run at a pace that keeps me comfortably in ""zone 2"" heart rate?  Or should I try to pick up my recovery pace? "
3728,Legs sweating during exercise,"I was working out yesterday, I have recently increased the pace at which I run at yesterday, for the first time my legs were sweating more than my upper body, usually it is my upper body that does the sweating, but for some reason my thighs were sweating rigorously. This has never happened before, could someone explain why we sweat more in some places than in others? why it isn't all round? and perhaps explain why that happened yesterday? it was only a treadmill workout. "
3729,Cardio or gym machines for best fat burning?,"So I made a contract with a gym to lose fat and become fit. My goal is something like this   Now I'm over weight so I need to lose fat (I think something like 14KG). I told the trainer in the gym about my goals and that I don't want big muscles or so. So the program he gave to me is to do exercises with some weight machines in the gym:   1- a machine that trains the legs muscles.  2- another the trains the back, and chest.  3- then an exercise with TRX for my stomach.  &amp; that was it. Then I was so confused that he didn't assign me any cardio exercises like running machine or cycling! His argument was that when I train my muscles, then the body needs to burn fat and that's how the fat will be burned. But then I insisted to go on the running machine and then he asked me to run one minute fast and then one minute slow. I found that I had a lot of sweat with the running machine than with the weight machines!  The trainer said that I should do many repetitions with low weights on the machines and that's how I achieve my goal.  My question is:  1- Is the trainer correct? Is it better to use the weight machines for fat burning than with cardio machines?  I'm worried because I don't want big muscles! I want to be fit and lose fat quickly! I don't want to work hard and then find out that it's not the bodyshape that I want.  "
3730,"Running, how many times a week? With what average speed? For how long?","I see advices that we shouldn't go to gym every day. But is it for everybody? or for the people that do serious stuff?  or if I just go run 1 mile in 13 minutes, do I still need to take a brake? Does 1 mile even count? Or I should run at least 2 or 3 miles? Every day?  I am 173lb and 5'8"" tall and 31 years old male, So do I need to run more? faster?

3731,Squat progressions,I am starting a (mainly) body-weight fitness routine and I have found squats to be WAY to easy.   There are two progressions I can try that I know of:  I can try to work towards pistol squats  OR I can use a backpack and keep adding weights to it.   What are the benefits/downsides of each approach?   Recommend any alternatives? 
3732,Losing Weight ASAP but in the right way,"Okay, to start off, my stats:     Age : 22   Height : 172cm   Weight : 95kg   I just want to lose wieght in the most effective way. Currently I'm working out (at least 3-4 times a week). I skip meals every night.  I need advice on how to do this in the fastest but right way.   Is what i'm doing correct? If not, what are the proper methods?  Also.. can you give me targets? (example, how many weight should one loss in a week/month) Thanks! "
3733,effectiveness when interleaving parts of workout,"My current weigth-training-plan is roughly like this:  arm-exercise-A 10-reps 2min pause arm-exercise-A 10-reps 2min pause arm-exercise-A 10-reps 2min pause arm-exercise-B 10-reps ... 2min pause leg-exercise-B 10-reps 2min pause leg-exercise-B 10-reps 2min pause leg-exercise-B 10-reps   Unfortunately it takes far too much time, and there is esentially nothing useful nor fun I can do in those 2 min pauses.  My question: Would the workout be less effective if I would intertwine the exercises of different muscle groups such that I fill the 2min pauses but there is still 2mins between the exercises of the same muscle-group?  For example (assuming that a 10-rep session takes about a minute):  arm-exercise-A 10-reps     leg-exercise-A 10-reps         1min pause arm-exercise-A 10-reps     leg-exercise-A 10-reps         1min pause arm-exercise-A 10-reps     leg-exercise-A 10-reps         1min pause ...   Will such a workout in your opinion be less effective in causing muscle growth? "
3734,How much should I speed train (% of total mileage),"How much should one speed train, in relation to my total mileage? Some resources (this one for instance) say that the amount of interval training should not exceed 7-15% of your total mileage. My question is: Is this also true for runners with very low mileage?   I'm currently training for a 6.5km (4miles) race. Due to my strength training schedule, I can only go running twice a week. I thought about doing interval training on Sunday and low intensity running on Thursday, but according to the above rule, this would be way to much interval training. Should I really be interval training only once every 4 weeks (which would be 12.5%)? "
3735,Should Let-Me-Ins be affecting my legs this much?,"I'm trying to get through Mark Lauren's You Are Your Own Gym Beginner program, as per my earlier question on ladders, Failure in ladder exercises - Am I misunderstanding rest periods?. When doing the ""Let-Me-Ins"", I'm finding that my legs seem to be taking the brunt of the effort. My arms, chest, and back are fine, but my legs are burning within a few reps. I know that I'm still hurting a bit from leg day, but is this normal?  [website]"
3736,Soy Protein and Protein Requirements,"I'm attempting to go a couple of weeks on a vegan diet inspired by ""The Game Changers"". However, everywhere I look I see most vegan recipes including soy: soy mince, soybeans, tofu, tempeh, or soy milk. Every recipe titled ""high-protein vegan recipe"" contains soy.  I've read multiple articles, including on this site, that state that soy protein is not good for muscle growth: estrogen by-product with high-consumption of soy counteracts testosterone benefits. A quick search shows answers that say ""avoid soy altogether"". Other websites say that you should limit soy protein intake to 3 - 4 servings to avoid these negative side effects and follow up saying that this shouldn't be a huge hurdle as you can easily consume your daily protein requirements (50 g) in under 3  - 4 servings.  My problem here is that I am currently consuming 180 g of protein per day in the form of whey isolate, ground beef, chicken, fish, and legumes. This has been a good number for me and I've seen a consistent strength increase. I can't see myself getting 180 g of protein without overstepping these 3 - 4 servings of soy. Three cups of soy milk is only 24 g of protein, 1.5 cups of tofu is 30 g of protein.  My questions:   Is soy protein really detrimental to strength and muscle growth in high consumption? Is there a version of soy that does not have negative side effects on strength and muscle growth? What does an increase of estrogen even look like at the gym? (i.e. is this just a marketing ploy? There's plenty of strong women out there.)   I realize this is mainly a nutrition question but I figured I would give it a shot as it relates directly to my fitness requirements. Consuming 2 kg of beans in a day seems like it just can't be sustainable.    Background and Related Fitness Information:  I began powerlifting about a year and a half ago but have only really started watching my diet within the last six months. I calculated a requirement of 180 g of protein per day from the 0.8 g to 1.2 g of protein per pound of bodyweight. I currently weigh 195 lb at a height of 6'0. Male. Canada.  My goal is to improve in the main lifts of powerlifting as well as the overhead press. The goal numbers are arbitrary and based on 250% to 100% body weight. Muscle growth is also important. I'm not focused on bodybuilding but looking good is nice.   1. Squat       --&gt; Current: 355 lb.   Goal: 405 lb.  2. Bench Press --&gt; Current: 225 lb.   Goal: 315 lb.   3. Deadlift    --&gt; Current: 420 lb.   Goal: 495 lb.  4. OHP         --&gt; Current: 135 lb.   Goal: 225 lb.   Since starting to track my nutrition and increase protein intake I've noticed that my recovery time is much faster and it has helped push through a plateau. I'm currently following a new 12-week peaking program with a 6-8% 1RM increase in Week 12. This week's workout (week 3) looks like the following:  Monday:     High Bar Squat (4x5 @ 250 lb), Walking Lunges (3x8), Single Leg Calf Raise (3x8) Tuesday:    Strict OHP (4x8 @ 95 lb), Flat Dumbbell Press, One Arm Row, Face Pulls Wednesday:  Rest* Thursday:   Snatch Grip Deadlift (4x8 @ 270 lb), Leg Curls, Back Extensions Friday:     Bench Press (4x8 @ 160 lb), Pull-ups, Seated Shoulder Press, Lat Pull Down, Dumbbell Rotations Saturday:   Rest* Sunday:     Rest**  *or arms: bicep curls, tricep extensions, preacher curls, dips, farmer walks **or cardio: 30 minutes rowing.   Unfortunately, either my Google-fu is lacking or the internet believes ""powerlifting"", ""vegan"", and ""high-protein"" are oxymorons. I don't believe I can achieve my fitness goals without achieving nutrition goals as they go hand-in-hand. "
3737,How to prepare for the first road bike challenge of the year?,"So I participate in a road bike race at the end of the month, and due to the cold weather and general winter laziness I didn't bike a lot.  I know that I can do the distance in theory; I've done a race of comparable distance, but a lot less elevation gain, last year. There is a maximum time for completion, too.   Should I focus on the distance or speed first?   I have two bikes available, a mountain bike and a road bike (which I'll be using in the race), should I use both for training? What other routines should I include in my pre-race-workout?   I planned on keeping my upper body workout going (dumbbell stuff, push ups, pull ups), should I add other activities, like running or swimming?     My goal is mainly completing the race, a good time and good ranking would be nice of course. "
3738,Shrug the traps in Overhead Press?,"I'm trying to learn to Overhead press and while reading the stronglifts.com guide I came across a safety warning where it says your bones will hit by lifting at that angle and to ensure that this doesn't happen, that you ""Shrug your traps"".  What does this mean? How do I do this and how do I know if I'm doing it wrong? Does it mean to lift the shoulders? Or the back? Do I do like a normal shrug, like up my neck? "
3739,Regurgitating during exercise,"So yesterday I did 55 minutes on the treadmill, the settings were 30 minutes at 9mph and 25 minutes at 8mph, all 55 minutes were done at 2% incline... then I did some squats, nothing heavy, it was 50kg and I was doing them slow and keeping good form. I did 2 sets of 30 repetitions.  Then I went back on the treadmill to some HIIT, then thing is when I was running I kept throwing up a little in my mouth, it didn't stop for the 30 minutes I was doing HIIT, my settings were 15mph for 1 minute, walk for 1 minute, all at 2% incline.  Why was this happening? Is there a reason my body was throwing up all this stuff? "
3740,How to loosen up the hamstring?,"I have a very hard hamstring. I can stretch my hamstring to a good extent, i.e., touch the floor without bending the knees with my knuckles but not beyond that. At that stretch point, I feel a stone-hard hamstring.    Is it normal? Should I stretch further to obtain a loose and flexible hamstring? Or is there something other than stretching, which I should do?  I jog some 1.5 km per day and do floor exercise (stretching and strengthening all different muscles) before hitting the pool. I swim some 2.5 km per day after the jog session. Will this help loose hamstring?    Please help... "
3741,Is there any specific time to do push-ups,"I have started doing push-up at home, after discontinuing from the regular gym. But, these days, I am leaving home early in the morning at 7:00 AM for work, I couldn't find time for push-ups in the morning. So, I just want to ask if its okay to do push-ups in the night at 8:30 PM?  Is it a mandate kinda thing that it must be done in the morning only. Or is it a common myth? I have seen some Fitness centers around, which display : ""Open in morning: 5-9 AM and Evening:6-9 PM"" on their shop boards. And, In some of the movies that I have seen, actors does push-ups at work or whenever they feel like, this may be a bad example.  Can I do push-ups at night? "
3742,Does training of some major muscles groups enhance overall muscle growth?,"There is a popular (e.g. link 1, link 2) theory, that is, if you train big muscle groups (e.g. legs, chest), it will increase the overall growth of muscles all over the body; the trained muscle will release signals (what are they?) into the blood stream and in turn, triggers the release of muscle growth/repair hormones (insulin-like growth factor?) which have effects on any (skeleton) muscle cells.  Is this story true? Will the muscle growth/repair hormones also enhance the smooth muscle or cardiac muscle? "
3743,Interval training versus linear training,"What are the pros of interval training over same intensity training over the same period?  For example, I walk for 1 min @6kmph and then run for 2 mins @9km/hr, repeat for 10 minutes.  Contrast this with walk @6kmph for 2 mins + run @9kmph for 8 mins.  Which style should I prefer for better workout? "
3744,First run after a year...what next?,"I decided yesterday to get back into running and ran as I felt comfortable for as long as possible until I couldn't anymore. The thing that caused me to stop was my fitness being so poor as opposed to my muscles giving in.  I ran 2 miles which aren't great but it's been a long time so I had no idea what to expect. I ran my first mile in 6:11 and ended up doing 2.08 miles in 15:47.  Today I am quite sore, my thighs ache and walking is a bit uncomfortable because of it. But I really want to start running as much as possible and get my times down, run for longer and improve my fitness.  I weigh 143lbs (65kg) and I am 5'10 (178cm) tall but I want to lose 11lbs (5kg) because I have a bit of excess weight around my stomach - not much - but I don't have much definition there as I used to.  I was hoping to run every day after work for the foreseeable future but my soreness is something I suppose I didn't anticipate.  Is it wise to run whilst sore? I guess my body is getting used to running again but what should I do in the interim whilst they are repairing? I am really keen to improve my fitness and lose weight. "
3745,Why do good lifts feel effortless?,"I am curious what explains the difference between perceived effort and absolute effort for different types of movements. For example pull-ups and burpees always feel hard, while a 1RM snatch sometimes feels just effortless.  I know that there are concentric, isometric, eccentric movements. Is there a different neurological mechanism behind these that result in different perception, and if yes, how does that work?  Speed might be a factor as well. Are exertion of different muscle fiber types perceived differently?  What are the factors which determine the perceived effort of muscle movement, and how do they work? "
3746,According to whom breakfast is healthy?,I've certainly been taught breakfast is the most important meal of the day because while you sleep it's the longest period of time the body goes without food. Someone told me today that there is no science behind this claim. I did a Google search and there are roughly the same number of articles supporting breakfast is good vs breakfast is bad. 
3747,Struggling making size and strength gains with calisthenics,"This is probably discussion. I don't know how else to ask a specific question. I don't know any other serious fitness forum. This is the only one.  Should I change the whole routine or just some specific things in that routine if my progress is too slow? Routine would be: [website]And do I need a kcal surplus and 140g protein if I am NOT low fat? I have enough fat on me. The body should be able to use it. I'm your normal skinny fat guy who sits whole day and has fat everywhere. Legs, arms, belly.  Should I try cluster sets, if normal setsXreps don't give me normal progress?  183cm, 70kg, 6ft, 154lbs  Btw. I don't think i would gain faster with weightlifting. Yes, you can just add 1 kg weight, which you cannot in calisthenics. But my problem is that I cannot progress. I plateu 24/7. My body is so odd.  "
3748,Cable Squats vs Smith Machine Squats,"Are cable machine squats easier to do than squats on a Smith machine? I'm able to do about 220 pounds on the cables, but I'm doubtful whether I'll be able to replicate the results on a Smith machine. In terms of physics, I don't really see why they would be - both are assisted to some degree, but it seems to me that cables would actually provide less assistance since they are not rigid. Any ideas? "
3749,What are good exercises to balance Muaythai?,"While Muaythai is basically a full-body sport, my feeling is that it's no sport that developes the whole body equally without imbalances. I notice this most strongly about my legs and maybe the lower core.  Is this assumption basically correct?  What additional exercises will help to develop the whole body in a balanced way?  I'm aware that many gyms (including where I train) do a bodyweight set or similiar as a finisher - one classic is crunches, squats, pushups and supermans. Since gyms will vary widely about this, I would prefer if we talk about the imbalances created by the sport specific movements (throwing kicks, punches, elbows and knees, clinching, moving while sparring) and then about wether specific supplementary exercises make sense. "
3750,Are there any exercise that engage almost all of your muscles?,Are there any exercises that engage all or almost all(about 50%) of your muscles? If there are any exercise like this what are they called?  
3751,Outdoor gyms equipment/machines,"Recently I've found out that a few streets from my home the city has built a free outdoor gym. The problem is, the machines in the outdoor gym dont use any weights, and as far as I know, they have no regulation. I dont know how much Im pushing or lifting when using them.  A picture of one of the machines Im talking about:   Now I have two questions:   Is there any sense to exercising at that gym, or am I better off just doing my bodyweight routines? Maybe I should mix the two? If the gym could be helpfull Im willing to use it, but I want to do most of the work with bodyweight exercises. Im gonna have a few delegations this year and I wont be able to visit any gyms at all for several weeks, so I would like to be able to do the core of my training everywhere. Is there any way to determine what % of my bodyweight I am lifting/pushing/pulling on various outdoor machines? (For example, lets say that the rowing machine lets me pull 70% of my bodyweight)   BACKGROUND FOR THE FIRST QUESTION  Ive been doing Stronglifts 5x5 for 2-3 weeks, but found the need for a barbell and weights too much of a problem, since I dont have a squat rack at home. The gym is too far away and recently they raised the prices. Also Im living in an apratment, so I cant really buy all the needed equipment. Ok, I can, but im simply not willing to do it. Thats why Im setting up a bodyweight program to ""replace"" it, see my last question here: Bodyweight strength training   Right now my main goal is to reduce my BF% from 26% to around 15%. I want to minimize muscle loss, or even increase my muscle mass, as im not a very advanced and should be capable of doing that. Increasing overall fitness is a secondary but important goal, especially the back - I got a weak back, and I slouch a lot (sitting office job).   As for the diet, Im not counting calories, but I eat lots of protein and limit carbs. Ive been losing weight since 11.2012, but last month my weight seemed to stabilize at 75kg and around 24-28BF%(down from 93kg and 35BF%)  I want to be able to do fun physical activities during the week without ruining my workout plan due to overtraining. Those fun activities may include swimming, riding a bike, playing squash, asg shooting games, a bit of historical fencing etc. I just sometimes do some of those things when im feeling like it - sometimes once a week, sometimes 4 times a week.

3753,"30% Body fat, what habits should I adopt?","I'm a 22 year old female. My body fat is 31%. I hadn't exercised in really long because I started last week because the flab I've gained on my stomach, thighs and sides of the stomach has become really noticeable and off-putting. I've started running but I'm obviously out of shape so get out of breath rather quickly. I have the following questions:-   Should be focussing on recomposition or weight loss? My diet is 70% carbs, 15%protein. What changes should I make? I've started running. Will that be adequate to help me get in shape?  "
3754,What differences in the muscle structure can be seen when trained for Strength vs Hypertrophy vs Endurance?,"This question is bugging me for few weeks now. Its not that I didn't try to look up. I never found a complete answer in an understandable language. From the articles I read over internet I could just pick up bits and pieces. Its still is incomplete.   As mentioned here:  +----------------------------+---------------+--------+-------------+-----------+-------+ | Variable                   |                    Training goal                         | +----------------------------+---------------+--------+-------------+-----------+-------+ |                            | Strength      | Power  | Hypertrophy | Endurance | Speed | +----------------------------+---------------+--------+-------------+-----------+-------+ | Load (% of 1RM)            | 80-90         | 45-60  | 60-80       | 40-60     | 30    | +----------------------------+---------------+--------+-------------+-----------+-------+ | Reps per set               | 1-5           | 1-5    | 6-12        | 13-60     | 1-5   | +----------------------------+---------------+--------+-------------+-----------+-------+ | Sets per exercise          | 4-7           | 3-5    | 4-8         | 2-4       | 3-5   | +----------------------------+---------------+--------+-------------+-----------+-------+ | Rest between sets (mins)   | 2-6           | 2-6    | 2-5         | 1-2       | 2-5   | +----------------------------+---------------+--------+-------------+-----------+-------+ | Duration (seconds per set) | 5-10          | 4-8    | 20-60       | 80-150    | 20-40 | +----------------------------+---------------+--------+-------------+-----------+-------+ | Speed per rep (% of max)   | 60-100        | 90-100 | 60-90       | 60-80     | 100   | +----------------------------+---------------+--------+-------------+-----------+-------+ | Training sessions per week | 3-6           | 3-6    | 5-7         | 8-14      | 3-6   | +----------------------------+---------------+--------+-------------+-----------+-------+   As can be seen from above table, different Load, Reps and Rest period between sets, give different results. Training for Strength, Hypertrophy (bulking or building mass), Endurance, Speed and Power are completely different (even though not mutually exclusive).  My question is what are the structural (anatomical) or physiological changes that can be seen if 5 identical persons, each train for Strength, Hypertrophy, Endurance, Power &amp; Speed?

3755,Why is the single leg deadlift stiff-legged?,"I'm wondering why is the single leg version of the deadlift is usually performed with stiff legs. For instance, exrx.net and most of the youtube videos that teach the single leg deadlift show it with stiff legs. What is the reason for this? Are there any risks when performing the single leg deadlift like the standard one? "
3756,Going from training 3 days/week to 4 days/week,"I've been training three days per week for about two months now and feel that I want to increase the amount of training I do. From mon - wed - fri, to mon-tue-thu-fri. Currently I have a two day training routine with 8 exercises each. Mainly kettlebells, but a few machine exercises aswell.   What do I need to think about?  For example, I'm concerned about overtraining muscles.   Training the same musclesgroups two days in a row, is that bad?  If I still have soreness in the muscles from training the day before, is there a danger in training again? "
3757,Eating more and still losing weight,"I started regular exercising a few months back (after years of being not so active). I have now been regularly spending 1h on the treadmill every other day and started losing weight. I am of course controlling my diet generally speaking eating oatmeal and milk, lean meat, fruit and as fat only olive oil and eating almost zero sugars (I think oatmeal and bananas help keep refined sugar away).  The thing is that sometimes, although I am not really strict (eating too much parmesan or too much white bread) on my eating habits I still lose weight.   What's the logic at work here? My body was almost asleep and now that my basic metabolism has started I am forgiven for some little mistakes? "
3758,Do seniors(age 60+) need to be treated differently in training?,"Apart from the obvious fact of lessened degree of training intensity, do seniors bodies respond differently to training stimuli? Besides increased risk of injury, is there a reason for a senior couch potato not to take up some kind of sports?  I suggested to my grandmother to start power walking, but don't want to let her get her hopes up if her body won't be able to build the necessary muscles. On the other hand, I lately read an article of a Grandpa who started running at 72, and finished his last 10k run at the age of 101 (even marathons in ~5h30). "
3759,Are dumbbells alone enough to build strength?,"If I do exercises with dumbbells each day, will that be sufficient to build strength and tone muscle? I don't care to large biceps, I am just after some strength and definition.  While doing other exercises would probably be better, would using dumbbells alone be sufficient? "
3760,What happens if don't consume enough fat?,"My aim is to build body. I've been working out in gym for past 2-3 weeks now. I train my full body hard thrice a week and 2 hours per workout day. Considering myself ""very active"" Interactive DRI for health professionals recommends:  Daily Caloric Needs: 3199 kcal/day Carbohydrate    360 - 520 grams Protein 48 grams Fat 71 - 124 grams    I've no problem meeting my Carbohydrate requirement. I'm trying my best to meet protien requirement but some how I'm missing out on meeting Fat. I've quite a bit of Fat in my body so I'm not consuming more than 30-40 grams of fat.  What happens if I don't consume enough fat? Should I increase my Fat intake? "
3761,How to strengthen my triceps for dumbells bench?,"I do dumbells bench press on Tuesday, and my triceps on Saturday. I would have expected my triceps not to limit my bench press practice anymore, but instead, they didn't have a positive effect. Worse: I feel my triceps more and more on the dumbells bench press, and they tire faster and faster, which leads to exhaustion that occurs earlier and earlier.  Is it normal? What should I do? "
3762,Will soda negate any effects from exercise?,"I drink a lot of soda, on average a liter per day. I seem to have a very fast metabolism and as I don't gain weight easily, have not been too concerned about health risks, partly because I think a lot of the claims are overblown and exaggerated.  It seems to me that soda is basically sugar water, with the only bad thing being excess sugar consumption, which isn't a problem unique to soda.   Most of the problems seem to be related to weight gain and as this doesn't seem to effect me I wonder if I have any reason to cut it out of my diet.  As I start to exercise, will my consumption of soda hold me back? If so, why? Please back up answers with links to reliable sources or studies where possible. "
3763,When selecting running trousers what should be considered?,"I'm starting to run more and more and think It's time to invest in good running trousers.  So I think you should consider the outside temperature and weather conditions ( If you run outside of course )  But what are other factors you should consider? I'm thinking support, tightness, sweat transport, shorts or long...  Would buying them online be a good options or should you go to a running store to get some better advise ?  So in short: what are general rules you should follow selecting running trousers? "
3764,"More flexible=weaker, more fragile?","Let's assume that there's a guy called Jeff, Jeff has inflexible hand, it is much more harder to move or bend Jeffs hand than to move his friends(Bob) flexible hand, therefore if Bob runs into a fight and an intruder tries to bend and break Bobs hand  is it easier to break his hand, since it is easier to move his hand(flexible) , am i right? But Jeffs hand is much more harder to move(inflexible) so the opposite happens, am i right?  "
3765,Tabata Training-- should I separate upper and lower body?,"I'm a 60-year-old male.  I'm a professional whitewater kayaking instructor, and I like to compete in kayak surfing.  My goal is to get in as good a shape for those sports as my limited time allows.  While I've always been very active, I am not and never really have been a top-flight competitor/athlete.  Because of joint issues I've had to stop hard weight training, but paddling hard is still within my abilities.  Between an injury and an operation, I'm still getting back into decent condition.  I have been doing Tabata intervals with the kayak between one and three times a week.  While they feel great, and they do give me a serious workout-- my paddling stamina is far better and I can feel my lats bumping up against my triceps lately -- I know that running would be an even better cardio workout.  I know that Tabata should not be an everyday thing.  However, should it be considered as separate types of workout for completely different muscle groups?  In other words, if I do my kayaking Tabata workout on M-W-F, and on one or two of the alternate days I do a running Tabata, is that too much stress on the aerobic system?  Or should I consider each Tabata day as if all of them were the same, and only do three a week no matter which one I do?  Or maybe max out at two Tabata days/week for each muscle group? "

3768,Is there any benefit of stationary running indoors?,"I ask further to Is there any benefit of &quot;real&quot; running outdoors vs running on a treadmill in gym?. I consulted [website]How does stationary jogging compare to treadmill running? Sadly, due to time constraints, I probably can't run outdoors.   Essentially, here's my routine. Every day, I run for around 13 minutes, but hovering around a small spot. I use a musical metronome and set it to 250 beats/minute.  "
3769,Does fat turn into muscles?,"So I'm overweight and I'm trying to lose weight. My question is: does the over fat turn into muscles with training? Because I was wondering if doing cardio and some lifting will just get me lose weight only and not build muscles. I.e. I thought maybe after losing the overweight, then I should completely left to only lifting with a specified diet in order to get some muscles. I don't want big muscles, but just nice looking body for the beach. So is my over fat going to be muscles with the training or what? "
3770,Losing weight rapidly,"I am 25 years old. My height is 172.5 cm. My weight as of today(26th Apr, 2013) is 54.3 kg. I was 56.5 kg, 4 weeks back. My BMI is 18.25.  I have been swimming really hard in this period, covered around 75 km (oh yeah, I am trying to become a good triathlete). I have been eating a lot of vegetables, 2 eggs a day, lot of rice, nuts &amp; sprouts but still I am losing a lot of weight.   Also I am feeling tired after every swim session and I sleep for 2 hours subsequently.  Is it really alright to lose this much weight rapidly? How much will champion athletes BMI be (really curious on that)?  "
3771,Finding the correct Marathon Pace,"Last Sunday on the weekly LSR, I got to talk with a follow runner that was about to run his first Marathon in 2 months time. The subject was how to find the correct Marathon pace, and it turned out that most of us on the group had wildly different rules as to how to find the correct or optimum pace.  We came up with the following list of methods and I wonder if any of you have anything specific to say about them. (Yes, I do know that is not a proper Q&amp;A, but I have no ideas where else to ask the question...) Assume that you have run a half-marathon at 1:45:00 (=4:57 min/km)...   We had ""double the distance, means add 13 sec/km or 20 sec/mile"" (no official reference, but see Runners World), which gives 5:10 min/km (=3:38:00). We had ""2*HM+20 minutes"", which gives 3:50:00 (=5:27 min/km). Run for 60% HRR, which for me would give 5:25 min/km (=3:48:00) We had ""age-grade is constant"", which would give 3:39:00 (=5:12 min/km) (see this calculator for numbers). The idea here is that if you run at the x% of the speed of the fastest HM runner at your age, then you can do the same for the fastest Marathon runner also your age. We had Pete Riegels formulars, which gives 3:38:00 (=5:10 min/km). I have used these via SportTracks for some years, and testify that they are somewhat optimistic unless you really are doing an all-out effort. We had ""VO2max is constant"" method based on work by Daniels and Gilbert, which gives 3:38:00 (=5:10 min/km).   Although the methods are rather different (at least as I seem them), they tend to give almost the same results: either 3:38:00 (=5:10 min/km) or 3:50:00 (=5:27 min/km). I have no doubts that the later speed will give a more comfortable and sure run with little risk of injury whereas the former will probably give some sore legs for the next week.  How would you rate these methods? Should we tell our fellow runner to go for the fast pace (he is young and confident of himself) or the slower pace? "
3772,Is calcium citrate safe to consume for vegans?," ﻿Can taking calcium supplements increase the risk of a heart attack? advises against calcium supplements,  contrary to Calcium Supplements: Is there any good and no harmful calcium supplement out there?.    I don't know if the food recommendations below yield sufficient calcium:    Veganism: How can one get enough Calcium on a vegan diet without taking supplements or eating/drinking fortified food/drinks?   and 4.  Veganism: Ethical, moral and environmental concerns aside, what is the scientific basis of a vegan diet? How do the human body's need for calcium, protien etc get taken care of in a diet devoid of dairy and meat?.  I only ask about calcium citrate, and not other calcium supplements (like calcium carbonate), because      Research shows that they are absorbed equally well with meals, but calcium carbonate is harder to digest than calcium citrate. People are usually advised to take calcium carbonate with or soon after a meal. Calcium citrate can be taken at any time.  "
3773,"Running or climbing stairs that are enclosed, any risks?","I have started doing running stairs in the building I live in. There are 26 floors. However the stairs are enclosed with only a fire exit as a door (no windows). And only the 26th (penthouse/amenities) floor is unlocked. The air is a bit stale/heavy(?) since the area is enclosed, does anyone believe that this might be a risky environment?   Note: When I was starting out, when I run out of breath during mid floors, I felt hard to catch my breath, and thought it might be the stale air, but lately I've been able to get better at it... "
3774,Is it possible to gain muscle with cardio/aerobics?,"I believe the best way to gain muscle is heavy weightlifting. I've done that before using a routine based mainly off of the Stronglifts program and I saw good results. However, until recently I was under the impression that heavy resistance/weight training was the only effective way to gain muscle.  However, I'm now wondering if more aerobic exercise can't also result in a certain amount of muscle growth. Yesterday I spent a half-hour on the eliptical machine during my lunch break at work. I wasn't trying to get a heavy workout in, just energize myself a bit and relieve some stiffness before I went back to the office. However, today my I'm definitely feeling DOMS (delayed onset muscle soreness) in my thighs. Does that mean that this activity has the potential to increase muscle strength?  I've also seen workouts like the Tabata method, or ""Burpee""-centric workouts that favor lower weights and resistance with a faster pace and intensity. These seem to be more for fat-burning and cardiovascular health, but also claim to build muscle as well. Granted, most cardio/aerobic workouts aren't as intense as that. Still, it seems like a relevant data point.  So my question is - can a person build muscle using cardio, aerobic, or other lower-intensity training methods? Or do you only build significant muscle when pushing yourself close to your max load?  Pleas note that I am not asking whether aerobic exercises are as effective as building muscle as training with heavy weights is. I assume that they are not. I'm just wondering if they produce any significant results at all. "
3775,"Correcting squat form, mild knee pain, numb thumb","Basically started with the low bar squat (following StrongLift 5*5) but being very skinny (179 cm, 58 KG) the bar doesn't rest at the shelf created in scapula as described by Mark Rippetoe in this video. If I try going that low, the bone hurts there. This led me to squat with the bar a little up, somewhere on the traps, which qualifies for the high bar squat. Things went smoothly till now, when for the last couple of workouts I noticed a mild knee pain afterwards, its just some sensation that I know goes away with rest.   Secondly as the weight has got a bit heavier the current bar placement also feels on the bone, which I guess causes the thumb to go numb after the workout. Here is the video I shot today to check my form.   Please advice me for these two issues and point out things that I can do to improve my squats and bear more weight. "
3776,optimal resting period for strength,"I'm currently doing a (mainly) body-weight routine that involves 3 circuits of:  15 close grip push ups 15 squats plank 1-2 min 5 chin-ups 5 pull-ups (just started the *ups lagging behind in that dept) dead-lifts   I used to try to rest as little as possible, but I recently started running on my off days, so I'm getting my cardio in that regard.  So, my question is as follows; If my goal is strength/muscle mass, can I rest as long as I need to between sets(not just circuits, but the actual sets).  If I let my heart rate go all the way back to normal, Not only does it make my workout more bearable, but I can crank out extra reps and work myself harder. For example, In just the past week, I progressed from 1 min planks to 2 min planks and made a lot of progress in the other areas as well. Does this benefit outweigh the benefit from the low-rest intervals?  Is there an optimal rest period I should shoot for? "
3777,Weekly distance buildup for 100k ultra,"I'm going to run a 100k next July. I'm trying to plan my weekly mileage, and I'm wondering what periodisation I should do.  I'm currently thinking of going for a monthly basis. Increase in week 1 &amp; 2, then maintain the higher mileage in week 3, then lower mileage to recover. For example:  Week-1: 74 Week 1: 86 Week 2: 98 Week 3: 98 Week 4: 80  Since I have plenty of time, I don't really need to increase too fast. Repeating the mileage in the 3rd week allows me to evaluate if I've accumulated fatigue or not. Then I have an easier week to recover. Then in the next serie I will to a bit more than 100, etc.   Any argument for a shorter period? For example every other week? Any argument for a longer period? Why would it make sense to increase continuously for longer?   Details: I've run a 100k before (few years ago). I have a good volume basis. The overall idea is to bring my weekly distance to 100k on a regular basis, but it's fine if the pullback week goes below that, or if for whatever reason I do less for 2-3 weeks. I also have to manage the increase of my long runs in parallel to that. Which is also a reason why I though of a long cycle. I know about ""the 10% rule"". I think it's fine with a good base volume to do more than that.   "

3781,Crossfit Times MWF or TWTh,"I've been doing crossfit for about 7 months now, and I'm extremely happy with the results.  For the amount of time I put in and the amount of results I see, I can hardly believe it.    I've recently switched from a Mon/Wed/Fri workout week to a Tue/Wed/Thur workout week, and I feel like I'm struggling a bit more.  Here are my questions:   How much difference is there in those types of schedules?   Is the struggling all in my head?     I find that after 4 days off (fri/sat/sun/mon) my workout on Tuesday seems that much harder.     Any thoughts or input would be great. "
3782,is running speed only a (body weight) / (leg strength) ratio?,"I want to be able to run fast. Sub (7.5-min / mile) at a marathon distance. I am trying to figure out why I can't run that pace for even 1-mile. I am not interested in endurance yet. Building endurance at a slow pace is not the way I want to train.  Are any of the following bullet points wrong?   the only variables that influence speed are (1)cadence (2) stride length. cadence has a very low upper bound. (170 strides / min) seems as high as possible. a stride causes you to be propelled forward, and lifted upward. And, this ""lifting upward"" side-effect is the real limiting factor.   Therefore, a runner who wants to go as fast as possible need only work on minimizing the ratio of (body weight) / (leg strength), right? Gravity is slowing me down. Is there anything other variable that could possibly make me run fast?  (I already eat an good diet. And, I can't believe hydration matters for runs of just 3 miles). "
3783,"Does loading and unloading weight help build muscle, lose fat and develop strength?","As part of my regime to build muscle, develop strength and lose fat, i am progressively loading weights as part of each set.  For example, once sufficiently warmed up, a bench press set looks as follows. Each set encompasses 10 repetitions.   45 pounds/20 kgs 66 pounds/30 kgs 88 pounds/40 kgs 99 pounds/45 kgs 110 pounds/50 kgs   Sometimes when i start hitting 110 pounds/50 kgs, my muscles are tiring however i'll attempt to try and get as may repetitions e.g. 5.   I'll then drop back to 99 pounds/45 kgs and attempt to get an additional 10 repetitions.   How does this affect the goal of building muscle, losing fat and developing strength?  How does it affect muscle recovery? "
3784,Progressing from supinated to pronated chinups/pullups,"I've been getting better and better at doing chinups/pullups but I'm only able to do the ""easy"" ones, the ones with supinated grip, palms facing me.  I'm overweight but not enormous (185cm, 100+kg) and not known for my fitness, but it's improving.  Anyway the ""hard"" chinups/pullups with pronated grip, palms facing away, are so much harder for me that I can still barely do one even though I can do up to fifty ""easy"" ones if I spread out the sets.  Are there some techniques especially for progressing from ""easy"" to ""hard"" chinups? Anything that should be taken into account when overweight?  (I'm just using local outdoor gym equipment. "
3785,"Should I reboot Starting Strength program, to get better results?","I had started Starting Strength (SS) on mid January, 2013, and have continued 3 workouts/week since then (I think I missed only 2 workouts when I fell sick in between). But, while introspecting if I was progressing correctly today, I happened across this article by Rippletoe, which had the following lines:     if you’re three months into the program and your squat has gone up 50 pounds, YNDTP (You're Not Doing The Program). If you’re 3 months into the program at 10% bodyfat and you have only gained 6 pounds, YNDTP. If you’re 3 months into the program at 30% bodyfat, your waistline has not gone down 4 inches and your squat is not up 175 pounds, YNDTP.    I realized that I would immediately fall in the first category (my squat went up from 70lb to 120lb since I started, with a bodyweight increase from 145 to 159lbs).   Note:    I had a problematic lower back in my childhood and hence didn't want to aggravate it by rushing too quickly in the beginning, hence I wasn't pushing myself too hard in the beginning (this was also the first time I started a strength program)  I also did not look too closely at what I had been eating and more importantly, what I should have been eating. I've only done so for the past week or so, and have realized I didn't eat properly before!   So, at this juncture, what should I be doing? The following seem to be the options:   Keep eating properly, and continue the program. Deload, and start at a lower weight - but if so, should I be starting from the very beginning (the empty bar) and work my way up? Some pointers on effective deloading, if thats the remedy needed, would be greatly appreciated. Give SS a rest for a definite period, and then start from where I left off, eating and resting properly in the meantime.   Further details: My age is 28, I'm 5'11"" and prior to starting SS, had only completed a C25K program (to build up my cardio capacity).  Let me know if additional details are required for a well-crafted answer!  EDIT: I was asked to elaborate on my fitness goals, which are as follows:   From the SS program, I want to be able build sufficient strength to do standard powerlifts (squats/presses/deadlifts) in multiples of bodyweight - e.g DL 3x my body weight, Squat 2x my body weight etc (I assume these are standard strengths since I've seen most people be able to perform in the gym) Once I've achieved that, I'd want to move on to a mix of cardio/weight training, so as to get into a defined body shape that I can maintain then onwards. Ideally, I'd like to be able to finish the first step in 6-8 weeks, so I'm looking at what I should be doing to accomplish that...  "
3786,Need advice on current food intake,"This week I started doing 1 hour of yoga and 30 minutes of mixed exercises every morning. I also started a diet but am a little confused regarding my food intake. Could I get a second opinion? Does this look okay?   (10:00 AM) Mixed nuts (almonds, dates, cloves, walnuts, sunflower seeds) (11:00 AM) Milk shakes with cereals (Toned milk, Protein one table spoon, Tulsa leave, one spoon turmeric powder, honey, cardamom, 8 to 10 spoons cereals (like muesli, cornflakes or oats) (2:00 PM) 1 cup espresso coffee (3:00 PM) Sprouts or fruits (1 bowl sprouts or 2 apple or 1 small bowl pomegranate) (4:00 PM) 1 cup green tea (5:00 PM) 2 medium size sandwich of peanut butter, spread, jam or raw cucumber, tomato (9:00 PM) Proper Indian food as a Dinner which includes lots of veggies, grain, sum rice and lentils   As I am desk jockey I spend most of my time in front of computer. I am a vegetarian and my goal is to get a balanced diet with good nutrition and lose some weight if possible.  Any suggestions are welcome. "
3787,Why do we need a resting period?,"Everything you read about training tells you: Resting is just as important as training.  I understand that if I train to much I get a negative training result. But do we really have to rest like running one day and taking a day off? How is that different from just running every day but half the distance?  I'm interested in the biological or biomechanical background for the need of actual rest periods. Or references that demonstrate that training less intense with out rest days is ok too.  I'm primary interested in running, but kind a hope the same principles apply for all kinds of training.  This question: Importance of Rest Days is similar yet different. It's answers don't talk about what is actually happening inside the body and cells, except for some ""supercompensation"" handwaving. "
3788,Do you need streching after bodyweight workouts?,"Following a couple of stellar reviews, I decided to end a period of indecisiveness, got myself You Are Your Own Gym, read through the explainy part and started the Basic Program.  I wonder why YAYOG never once speaks about stretching after the workouts.   Is it so obvious that you should do them that omission is not an issue? That sounds wrong, given how the book seems to be written with absolute beginners in mind (some basic points are made over and over again).   Or is it that you don't need to stretch? Today I did back lunges which certainly strain and stretch the same muscles alternatingly, but other exercises don't seem to have this property.  While I am new to the whole fitness workout thing, I used to play team handball competitively so I have some concept (however inaccurate they may be) about of how to approach doing sports. We always stretched, and after these workouts I sure feel like I should stretch.  So, was is the general doctrine/consensus on stretching after bodyweight workouts? "
3789,Should I lock out my shoulders at the bottom of a pull up?,"When I'm doing pull ups, I try to go all the way down until the arms are straight, but I do not lock out my shoulders. Recently, I thought in order to get a greater ROM, it might be a good idea to completely lock out my shoulders at the bottom. After the workout I felt a slight shoulder pain.  Is there any real benefit in locking out shoulders? Or is it just bad for my shoulders and I should avoid it? "
3790,How to Change My Diet When I Add Exercise,"I'm naturally built and toned, and I was a swimmer. My arms have retained that, but through college my stomach has put on some weight. I'm now around 200 pounds at 5'10"". Some is probably due to muscle, but I want to take off 30 pounds (that's my goal, if I get my body back before that I'll stop).  I ate out twice a day for the past five years and didn't eat breakfast (mostly McD, Chick fil a, etc..). Now, as of three days ago, my diet is:    breakfast: two boiled eggs lunch and dinner: a store-bought salad, a carrot, an orange, some cheese, and some type of meat (tonight I had 1.5 burgers). I drink water.  I read a low carb diet was good, so I cut out all wheat / starch, including bread. I allow some wine in moderation. I'm usually starving by dinner time (though today, because of exceptional reasons at work, I didn't eat lunch, and I seemed to be mostly fine until dinner).    I'm going to start swimming (an hour of intense swimming) in the mornings again. I want to know how this will affect my diet. Should I add more sugars / starches / calories to my diet to keep up the energy level? I can't always wake up (practice is at 5:30 AM), so is it best to just eat the extra food the day of swimming, or should I eat it the night before and hope I wake up?  I've never had to watch what I eat, so this whole dieting thing seems complex. For the record, I had swam at this same place for about 2 months (average 3 times a week), and I would guess I lost about half my weight (gained it all back). During this time, I continued to eat out but occasionally was forced to go to Walmart because my exercise made me not want fast food.   Comments on my diet in general are welcome as well.  "
3791,Muscle imbalances related to indoor rock climbing/bouldering and ways to fix them,"Ive read that most climbers have a lot of muscle imbalances, including some that affect proper posture.   Is that true? What muscles are imbalanced? How do those imbalances affect posture? How to fix those imbalances, preferably without specialised equipment?  "
3792,Immersion Pressure Healing for Post-Exercise Soreness,"There is this idea I just heard/read about, in particular running, where after you've completed a distance run you can reduce post-exercise fatigue by immersing your legs in water (hot or cold) thereby exerting a hydrostatic pressure on the legs and redirecting blood flow in the sore area back to the core. This process claims to allow for rapid recovery.  What I found interesting is that the pressure was more important than the temperature, although the temperature is important. I then wondered if there was a way to increase the pressure on the legs.  Anyone here have any experience using denser liquids or perhaps pressurized boots or another post-exercise recovery treatment for sore ankles? Would suction cup therapy exacerbate the soreness? "
3793,combining Greasing the Groove with regular strength workout,"So I am interested in using Greasing the Groove(GtG) to increase my number of pullups and pushups. I am a beginner at strength training, so I figured I would post my question here.  My goal is more to increase strength rather than going for muscle size. I am trying to figure out how to balance GtG with regular strength workouts. In other words, If I continue doing strength training 3 days a week, would I just add short GtG sessions throughout the day on both workout days and rest days? Also, can I exercise the same muscles in my GtG sessions as in my full body workout sessions? In other words, if I do GtG pullups throughout the day or week, can I still do back rows or similar exercises during my regular workout sessions?   Of course I dont' want to overtrain. I figure it might just be a process of trial and error to see what works for me. Any suggestions? "
3794,Submaximal benching: are failed reps always controlled?,"I saw a video of a guy catastrophically fail at benching and drop the bar from an almost locked position. I also learned that he later died of internal injuries. He even had 3 spotters, so I no longer consider spotters to be a reliable fail safe.  I guess I always knew this was a possibility if one fails in an uncontrolled manner, but I'd always assumed that when someone stalls they can just slowly lower the bar back to their chest, then do the ""roll of shame"".  The key difference between what he was doing and what I do is that I never max at bench. I always work in the 5 rep range. So my question is: how concerned do I need to be about catastrophically failing like that in a submaximal rep range? Will one always be able to slowly lower a stalled lift in higher ranges or should one lift in a power rack if they want 100% safety? "
3795,Would I benefit from protein shakes?,"My wife and I plan on doing some weight training and want to know if we should drink protein shakes?  My plan is to eat dinner around 6pm and around 7:30pm start riding elliptical and after the elliptical, do some weights.  My wife plans on doing the same, just late morning or early afternoon.  Someone told me if I do weights, I should also start drinking protein shakes and they recommended Optimum Nutrition 100% Whey Gold Standard.  Should I have a protein shake before or after (or both) weight training?  Also does this protein shake have chemicals in it?  Or is there a better protein shake?  Also on the days I just do elliptical or nothing, should I still drink protein shake?  Thanks for anyone’s help!  **Edit 1** Ok, maybe I wasn't clear on what I was asking.  Let me try again.    I’m not really looking for nutrition fountain of youth.  My wife and I want to start lifting weights, her for toning and me to bulk up a bit.  I really don't think we get a enough protein, even though I really don't know how much is enough.   So, I'm not sure when I should drink it, how many times a day I should drink it, when I should drink them or if I should based on my diet.  I'm really clueless when it comes to most of this. "
3796,Please review my workout plan using gymnastic rings,"I have a simple bodyweight gym at home which includes:   pull up bar gymnastic rings on bar a 40lb brick    My workout plan is 3X a week, around 45m-1h:   Pullups 8 reps, 3set. Alternate with dip, 90s rest Ring Dips 8 reps, 3sets. Alternate with pullup, 90s rest Half-Pistol squats(too weak for a full pistol...), one leg at a time. Alternate with ring pushups. 90s rest Ring pushups, 8 rep, 3 set, alternate with squats Deadlift the brick 8 rep, 3 set... it's working right now since my legs are my weakness Ring rows. 8 rep, 3 set. alternate with deadlift   Currently, I am only aiming for 8rep, but on the later sets I'm not able to push that far.  I think the upper body exercises I have are great and there are some methods to increment load for them, or I can wear weights.  My problem is on the lower body. Right now what I'm doing now is pretty taxing to me, so it's no problem. In fact, I always struggle to catch my breath after doing the leg exercises. I'm open to suggestions to a better way to approach them.   One of my struggles with this routine is even after a few months of being very good at the the exercises, I still struggle to meet all the reps. There's definitely significant gains, but for the last few exercises I can definitely feel the fatigue built up from previous exercises.  Overall, how would you rate this workout plan? What are some easy things I can add to make it more effective?  "
3797,"What amount of excess calories, and in what proportion of macro-nutrients, is most effective to bulk up while doing Starting Strength?","My ultimate goal, as detailed in this question, is to ""build sufficient strength to do standard powerlifts (squats/presses/deadlifts) in multiples of bodyweight - e.g DL 3x my body weight, Squat 2x my body weight"", using Starting Strength in a reasonable period of time (6-8 weeks would be best, but I can stretch it upto 12 weeks if so required)  For that, I want to ensure that I'm eating correctly, both in terms of calories consumed and proportion of macro-nutrients absorbed. I used a number of sources to build some sort of a eating plan, I want the community's opinion on it (I don't want to find out, after 3 months, that I've been over/under eating all along!)   Before I started SS, I was a ""skinny-fat"" person, so I went looking for an eating plan targeted at people like me. I found this post in a supposedly reputable forum, which advised that I need to eat 10-20% over my maintenance calories. Armed with that info, I used online calorie calculators (like this) to estimate my maintenance calories, which came down to between 2300 - 2400 calories for my body type/fat % etc. Then, I wanted to know what balance of macro-nutrients to have every day - I followed Rippletoe's advice in his wiki, and decided to give a Carb/Fat/Protein ratio of 50/25/25 a try.   With all the above, the following became my diet plan for everyday:  Net Calories ~ 2700(2350 + 15%) KCal  Carbs : 337g = 1350 KCal Fat   : 75g = 675 KCal Protein: 170g = 675 KCal  I want to bulk up both in terms of mass and lifting capacity in a week-to-week basis. My current stats are:  Age: 28,  Height: 5'11""  Body Weight: 159 lb  Fat %: 12-14 (using callipers)  I believe that for my height, a body weight of 175- 185 lbs with the same/lower fat % would help me achieve my strength goals. My question(s) are:   Is my target weight/strength goals realistic, given the time frame - if not, what should I be aiming at? (I'm not looking for a quick fix - its just that I'll have significantly less time once Fall semester starts, and I want to make the most of Spring/Summer). Am I eating too much/too little in terms of sheer calories?  For my fitness goals, are the balance of macros sufficient? As long as I'm staying mostly clean of junk food/refraining from eating out more than once a week, are there any specific food items that are better than others that I should either try to get more of (veggies/fish) /try to avoid (red meat, whole milk etc) - despite them adding up to the exact total for each day? (In other words, are th sources of macro-nutrients important as well? )  "
3798,Relation of physical fitness and age,"Why does the physical fitness tend to decline around the age of 30-35? It is obvious that many athletes(football, sprint etc.) tend to stagnate and 'lose' the physical fitness regarding speed, stamina and so on compared to their mid 20s.  Is it possible to reduce this effect or even push it years ahead? "
3799,Are protein shakes healthy and safe?,"Are protein shakes healthy and safe? Because they look as medicine to me. Powder that you mix with water. This seems un-natural like pills or so. I'm actually very hesitant to use them, so I'm thinking to only use natural food that are rich in protein like tuna or chicken breasts. What do you think? "
3800,Power rack outside / 5x5 workout during winter,"Will be starting ICF 5x5 next month, however, If the only place you can store your power rack is outside, and consequently do your workouts, what would you say are 'must do's' for such a setup ?   What could one do to keep the equipment in decent shape considering midwestern weather ?   Are there any health risks, precautions to take, etc., on lifting weights outside during winter ? "
3801,Fixing Shoulder Asymmetry,"I had pain in my upper back from head forward posture and my physical therapist recommended doing TRX and prone I's, Y's and T's (I added W's in as well). I also have a small, but noticeable asymmetry in my prone T where on my left side I can't lift a 5lbs dumbbell as high as with the right arm.  I am worried that this asymmetry will perpetuate through other lifts with my body naturally shifting the weight onto my right side. For example, on TRX a slight shift in arm position changes the strain significantly.  Should I take precautions to fix the symmetry? If so how? "
3802,Why do we Clench our teeth when exerting?,"I have heard that clenching teeth will help you lift more weight, how does clenching your teeth help you to lift more weight? Why do we clench our teeth when exercising?if it can cause dental damage why do we even do it in the first place?  Some mouthguards claim that they can help improve performance, make athletes faster and stronger, how  is this possible?  "
3803,does being able to lift more weight mean more strength?,"so I thought this question is physics-related, so why not elaborate here.  Muscular strength can be combined not just by muscle mass but density, neuromuscular conditioning, joints, leverage, etc.  So does being able to lift a heavier weight than one another, or just a specifoc weight for more repetitions mean the be all end all of absolute strength? Because if I can lift more and another can not, does that, in physics or in any understandable series of sense, imply that I who lifts a greater amount of mass that another can not make me stronger by all means, no exceptions, or is strength not necessarily linear?  Any input regarding this would be nice. "
3804,Calories burn rate calculation -- scientific studies,"There are many online calculators for measuring walking/running/bicycling calories burn rate. They differ in input parameters like some might need my weight as well as height and some don't. Almost none take into account duration of the exercise (and this is crucial in my opinion).  So my question here is: Where are these formulas (used in these calculators) coming from? Any scientific studies perhaps? Are they reliable?  Also I would like to know what is the most accurate method available for measuring the burn rate (I'm only interested in the scientific part, not going to do this myself). "
3805,Failure in ladder exercises - Am I misunderstanding rest periods?,"So, my mother got me a copy of Mark Lauren's You Are Your Own Gym book, and I'm trying his workout plan. For the first week, everything is done as ""ladders"" where the plan is to do one rep, rest, two reps, rest, etc, until you've hit a number of repetitions where you feel failure might happen in subsequent sets, then do n-1 and so on down to one rep. He says that the rest period should be equal to the work period in length, and the ladder should take 7.5 minutes (if you finished a ladder before then, you start back at 1). The thing is, I was trying it with pushups and I barely made my way through two repetitions of the ladders (first time, with a high of five and the second one with a high of three) before my arms were rubbery enough that I couldn't get a single rep in.  Since each pushup was taking only a little more than a second, the rest periods were short too. I didn't even feel like I could exit the push-up position without running out of time. Should I be taking more time in between? Only count the time from when I'm out of position? Should there be rest periods in between ladders?  I know he has various DVDs and an app for his program, but I'm loathe to put more money in if the answer is simple. "
3806,Building muscle and trimming fat at same time? bulking/cutting phases?,"Hi I began gym 2/3 months ago.  I go about 5 days a week and my routine is as follows: 30-60 min cardio, 45 minute weight lifting (targeting each muscle group on a different day)  Currently: female, 145 pounds, 170cm tall  Goals: lose body fat &amp; gain muscle  Question: I realise you can't lose fat and gain muscle at the same time. So if I continue doing this (cardio &amp; lifting) and eat under maintenance calorie on some days and over maintenance calorie on other days, getting adequate sleep and protein, what will happen? Will I gain any muscles or is it all just a waste of time?  Also what would happen if I alternate between a week of hard training and resting? And one week eating over maintenance and another week eating under maintenance? Would this allow me to lose weight and grow muscle? "
3807,What should I look for in electronic measurement of body composition?,"Would one combined with a scale be sufficient?  Or is better to measure on other points?  Is the accuracy about the same for all scales?  One thing I really need is something that stores or transmits the information, so i don't have to note it down everything. "
3808,Is there a good and bad kind of soreness after exercise?,"I vaguely remember being told that there are two kind of soreness after exercise, one indicate good things (e.g. your muscle is being trained) and the other bad (e.g. you didn't warm up or cool down properly), and both have their fancy name and acronyms.   Is such distinction accurate? Do they differ in a way that I can notice, e.g. can I tell by the duration, the ""feel"", or the location of the soreness? "
3809,Spine standing out in the middle of the back,"I've started training about 3 months ago. I had neglected my lower back training for a while before starting to train it again. Now, my body fat percentage is about 10% and my spine is very visible in the middle of my back . Is this due to the lack of muscle mass in the lower back ? if not,what muscle do I have to train to get rid of that skinny look ?    Note: I do pullups, bodyweight rows and arch ups to train the entire back.  "
3810,Longer time to stand up from left Crossed Leg Sit crossed leg,Why does it take me a long time to stand up from a Crossed Leg Sit when my left leg is behind than my right leg behind (see linked video)? Does it relate to the mind or to the physical leg muscle? 
3811,How (much) can a metabolism slow down?,"Always when you read about diets, you also read a warning saying that a too small calorie intake will slow down your metabolism. However, I can't find any sources explaining what exaclty slows down and how much engery is conserved through this slow metabolism (1%, 5%, 50% or maybe 99%?).  I know from experience that I can't reach the max. performance in sport during a diet as glycogen reserves are depleted faster and ketogenic processes take a while to kick in, but these kinds of reduced enegery consumption are in general additonal accitivies that are not required to keep up life.  When I sit on a chair and just fart around, is my energy ""consumption"" reduced through the following things, as compared to a normal food routine?   Does the heartrate sink? Is blood renewed slower? Does my brain work less? Do hair and nails stop growing? Does my immune system take a holdiay? Do my bowls drain the food more completely? Do I produce less semen? Do injuries heal slower? Do my cells get older (recycled later), thus maybe even increasing the cancer risk? Is my temp lower?   I presume most of these things can only be reduced slightly in order to survive, so where does the body optimize energy ""consumption"", and how much savings are we talking about?   Even when eating massivly less than required (e.g. 5000KJ under maintainance requirements over more that 2 weeks) I do not notice massive drawbacks in bodily functioning, therefore I am questioning these warnings. Furthermore you often read about a ""starvation mode"" and even a ""ruined metabolism"" - is there any scientific indication that such things exist and are inreversible (slowly reversable)? If so, why does the body in gerneral not work in this more effiecent state if there are no drawbacks?  I'm not questioning that lifting heavy weights while eating less will conserve more muscle mass. Also please don't give answers along the lines of changing your food consumption in general to lose weight (e.g. what the word diet really means). I'm using the word ""diet"" in the wrong modern way, as a limited time change of food intake. "
3812,How do I prevent the scraping that occurs when I rotate my leg about my hip?,"I recently started taking parkour lessons and after a full day of vaulting and jumping around, the area around my hip flexor (or possible the hip flexor itself, I'm not a doctor) hurts. For some reason, it seems to only happen to my right leg (probably because of a tendency to vault a certain way based on right-handedness). When I stand on my left leg and then lift and rotate my right leg, it feels like a tendon being caught on something. Sometimes after a few rotations or stretching, the feeling will go away (though the soreness remains) but then return again later.   I'm trying my best not to fall into the trap of trying to self-diagnose with the internet and I can't afford a doctor for the time being, so I'm hoping to find some advice here. Is anyone familiar with the feeling I'm describing? How can I treat and prevent it?  Attempting to push my knees down while in the butterfly position causes a feeling of tightness (of both legs) in the same spot and I believe it may be similar to what the poster of a similar question experiences.

3813,Toning jiggly loose muscle,"My question has two parts:  I have very muscular thighs and legs coming from years of swimming and running since I was younger.   The thing is, both my thighs and legs are pretty jiggly when I don't flex them. If I flex/tighten them, they look nice and muscular.   (1) What really is going on here ? Is it muscle laced with fat, or just muscle yet to be toned ?   (2) Can I work to tightening them up? Is it even possibly or is it just part of my physique? How do I tighten or tone them?   (For last 3 months, I have been on a workout program for upper and lower body.My lower body workout consists of lunges, squats and other compound trainings)  "
3814,How to use less abs/core in this exercise?,"I don't have a pullup bar and don't intend to get one at my current apartment  What the apartment hand is this:    Except it has two separate unconnected handles instead of a close grip handle  Aside from using less weight, what are some things you can do in terms of positioning/the way you pull to use less abs?  I don't really intend to work abs/core and don't want to make them bigger for aesthetic reasons - I never get lean enough to show them anyway and just want a smaller midsection overall and larger lats for a more v look   Currently when I do this exercise, I almost always end up using some abs/core.   Maybe does facing the other way help? Pulling the shoulders back?   If it helps at all, I usually use unconnected handles and pull downward in a neutral grip for both hands- I'm going to use this position and won't be doing underhand chinup or wide grip for no other reason than I just like how a neutral position feels.  "
3815,How to integrate box squat to my weekly leg workout,"I'm usually free squatting (8x) and leg pressing (4x)  For a change, and also to see whether I can improve 1-my hip flexors and 2- the bottom part of my squat, I want to include 4x box squatting, (with wide stance, if you wondered) instead of 4x regular squat, having at the end 4x of each method.  Should I do the 4x standard squat first or 4x box squatting first?  I would tend to fatigue my hips first to later emphasise the quads by starting with the box squat, but I'm not so sure.  What do you think? Thank you.  PS: my current workout plan is a 4days per week routine:   D1: shoulder back [push press, chinups ...] D2: glutes quads calves [squat, press ...] D3: chest biceps [bench press, curls ...] D4: hamstrings triceps [deadlift, dips ...]   I can't really do more.

3817,How does a chest heart rate monitor work?,"I am trying to troubleshoot a new Bluetooth heart rate monitor that is attached to a chest strap.  When I try to scan for Bluetooth devices with my computer or Android phone, it does not show up.  There are no lights or buttons on the device and I want to make sure I have it turned on.  Therefore, I'm trying to figure out how does it turn on?  The instructions say to   Wet the chest strap Snap the heart rate monitor to the chest strap Place the strap around your chest   Is it turned on when it's snapped to the wet chest strap?  I.e., is it activated when there is a conductive path between the two buttons on the sides of the device (via the wet strap)?  Is there a conductive path if the strap is dry?  Is it turned on when it's strapped to your body?  Does the monitor's circuit somehow pass through your body?  Does the device need to sense a pulse to begin transmitting?  Does it rely on detecting an electromagnetic field that is only achieved when the strap is against your skin?  Out of curiosity, does anyone know how these devices detect heart beats?  Is the device sensing the electrical current that causes your heart to contract?  Is the device sensing the electromagnetic radiation from this electrical current?  Is it sensing the pressure from a heart beat?  The device in question is a Polar H7 "
3818,"Not breathing enough, lack of continuous breath, shallow breath - what to do to fix it?","I realized that my breathing pattern is very shallow, sometimes almost lacking. As a programmer I spend a lot of time at the computer. I do exercise regularly, although maybe not intensely enough.   I have some issues, that might or might not be associated with it:   I get somewhat frequently sick   few times a year, always the same thing - mucous flowing from nose down the throat. This is somewhat permanent, even when I am not sick - I get sick when it flows in bigger amounts. I had been examined - no allergies, frontal and nasal cavities are clear, empty.  I tend to imagine bad things happening and get sad with bad thoughts - now I realized that I tend to stop breathing, when this happens. Also this works around. Thinking bad things tends to shallow my breath and that leads to more thoughts.  I am glad that I at least realized this to happen and am now more focused on breathing immediately when I feel down.  I had a conversation with a friend who told me, that a doctor asked her, if she does not experience being slow in social situations, not being able to follow what is happening. On her answering yes, she told her, that it might be caused by her breathing too shallow, which lead to brain lacking oxygen and thus not working effeciently and fast enough.  This can be applied to me too.     I understand that I need to work on my breath, make it more deep, but this is a task I do not know how to execute - breathing is completely subconscious, unless you make it conscious and I do not think I am able to focus on breathing 24/7.   Is there anything that can be done to fix this condition? To teach subconscious to breath deeply in an uninterrupted manner on its own?   "
3819,Efficacy of pilates for fixing 'computer posture',"I have started pilates (on machines) with the intent of reversing my 'computer posture'.  y arms rotate inward, and my shoulders slope forward.  This is a well-known problem that comes from using computers for too much time.  I've finished 4 pilates sessions.  It seems like we focus on front muscles, like the stomach, and not as much on back muscles, which are what I'm hoping to fix.  The last thing I want to do is make the front muscles tighter by working them out, and ignoring the back muscles.  Is the issue that we've just begun (fourth session)?  Do I simply fail to see the work the pilates sessions are doing on my 'computer posture' affected muscles?  Or, is pilates simply not good for computer posture? "
3820,Excercises to try correct knees pointing inward,"Since asking this question quite some time ago I have been on a quest to be able to squat.  I quickly managed to solve the ankle issue I was having by stretching daily against objects under my desk at work, but I still wasn't able to perform a squat. I can get parallel and all the way down into quite a low squat now without a bar, but once I add weight I find it really difficult and feel a lot of pain in my groin, inside my thighs, around the knees and and in my ankles (which make a crunching sound as I get to parallel).  I read the first chapter of Starting Strength and watched a tonne of videos of Mark explaining the squat. I noticed him mention that the knees should be outward in the same direction as your toes throughout the movement (at about 30 degrees). This is when I realized that when I stand up and point my feet straight ahead, my knees actually point inward at about 20-30 degrees. I also noticed that when I stand and walk, I generally do so with my toes pointed outward. This becomes an issue when I try to squat because I end up with my feet angling out extremely far so that my knees are wide enough to perform the squat (exceeding 45 degrees). If I try maintain a 30 degree angle with my feet all the way down, my knees end up buckling in the middle.  Is this problem something I can work on, or am I just born this way? Would I need to get an operation on my knees maybe to correct it, or are there exercises that I can perform to correct the angle of my knees over time? Any advice is appreciated. If anyone has any experience with this problem, especially related to performing a squat, then please share how you overcame it.  PS I have been squatting for several months; I've been using the Smith Machine and I haven't been able to increase my weight at all since starting even though I do them every week. I assume bad form because of my knees and the use of the Smith Machine is the reason for this. I have however increased my weight on leg press machine immensely (started on 40kg, now do 160kg). "
3821,Sugar vs. Aspertame,"A couple months ago I decided to stop drinking soda beverages that contained sugar, because despite cycling often and living a somewhat physically active lifestyle,  I wanted to avoid Diabetes and the other side affects of sugar that may negatively impact me. I still wanted to drink these beverages, so I have since opted to purchase the variety of these beverages that substitutes sugar with aspertame. More recently, I have read from many sources that Aspertame is significantly worse than sugar as it causes mainly cancer and weight gain, among other things.   I know Aspertame does not cause weight loss, at least not in any significant way, and that Diet soda, contradictory to its name, is not the key to having a successful diet. I do not drink diet soda to loose weight, as I do not have to worry about beng overweight in any way.  I drink diet soda purely because I was under the impression that it was better than regular sugar soda, however now I am unsure of which is better now.  So, Are the claims that aspartame has severe negative effects true? should I go back to drinking non-diet soda?   I'm sorry if this question does not fit here- This seemed like the best StackExchange site for my question. "
3822,Shortest Possible 100 Mile Race Prep,"Hey all I'm planning on doing a 100 mile race in February (about 12 weeks out). I've read online that BARE minimum theoretical race prep was like 9 weeks but they didn't provide a plan for that. Anybody recommend a schedule to run to make that it in 12? I can't find a prep for 12 weeks so maybe an experience runner (maybe even an ultra runner out there?) would want to try to modify one and if so I would be super grateful for the help!  Current fitness level is that i'm pretty active (mostly with weights) and I ran a marathon without any prep in 7 hours last month, so I figure with 12 weeks and a lot of luck I can get the 100 in 12 weeks. I am aware this is rushing it and not a great idea, i'm just looking for a conductor to help me steer this trainwreck to the finishline :D. The goal is to finish in 30 hours "
3823,Why exhale when using strength?,"I am puzzled as to why, during strength training, I need to exhale when I am using most force.      If you’re using strength training machines:      Start exhaling at the beginning of the movement – as you pull or push   the weights away from the weight stack. Inhale as you lower the   weights back toward the weight stack. If you’re using free weights:         Exhale as you work against gravity – as you lift, push, or pull the   weights away from the floor.    Inhale as you work with gravity, and lower the weights back to their starting position.      What is the benefit of breathing in this manner? What is the scientific principle behind this? "
3824,Cardio in swimming : long distances or interval training?,"I'm practicing a martial art and I'd like to work on my cardio. To do that most people run, but I've had knee problems so I'd rather pick up swimming instead (I also enjoy it more to be honest...). I'd say I already have a decent swimming technique.  My question is this : how should I train ? Should I go for interval training with short, fast distances in crawl with recuperation periods, or just swim long distances in crawl ?  Bearing in mind that my main goal isn't to progress in swimming itself, but rather to work on my cardio (primarily) and maybe along the way buff a little.   I think I'll be doing besides swimming two, maybe three practicing sessions of my martial art in a week, and if I have the time go to the gym once a week.  What do you guys recommend ? "
3825,Will Musclecore x and Androsolve help bootstrap my fitness routine to lose weight?,"Intro/Disclaimer:   I'm quite ignorant about fitness. I don't have a sharp body with 6 packs but I'm not horribly fat, just some belly (1.75m, 72 kg, male, 25yo). I'd like to have a sharper body and hopefully get the famous 6 packs. I started to go to the gym some months ago, once/twice per week without a real plan nor any diet change. Of course I didn't get any exterior visible result other than feeling a little bit ""better"" in general. I'm questioning two specific branded product because I'm not sure of what they contain, I'd make me happy if the answer mention similar product or what kind of ingredients I should look for, or avoid.   Now I've read the claim that ingesting some ""stuff"" like MuscleCore X and Androsolve daily should help dramatically and fast towards this goal. One pill a day of each product for some period.  See this translated link for instance. I'm not entirely sure what they contain and I'm wondering if they are worth to bootstrap a healthy lifestyle and helping me getting a nicer body for the summer.  And now...  Questions   What do the two products really contain? Is their claim true?  Are there counter notable side effect?  "
3826,Plateau on weighted pullups,"I got stuck on  weighted pullups today(tried 3x5 with 3 extra pounds). It was 5/5/2. I rested 5 minutes in between sets. I started weighted pullups Tuesday and completed the 5/5/5 with 2 extra pounds (although the last set was hard) and same amount of rest between sets. Ideally, I'd like to continue training weighted pullups 3 times a week.  I kept my diet the same(if anything I lost weight) 23,5"" 11',M,157 pounds  Do I need to decrease rest time? How do I get better at this and still keep frequency the same or do I need to increase frequency? Do I need to increase volume? Should I just progress slower, at 0.5 pounds?  Sorry for the dumb question. Not a repeat question, I'm not going for a one-arm pullup. "
3827,Half pull up for the Lats,Which half of the complete Pull up works the Lats more ?  For eg : If I do the lower half of the pull up will it involve my Lats more OR if I do the upper half of the pull up ?  My problem : I can't do more than 5-6 full pull ups in my first set and the number quickly falls down to 3-4 in the 2nd set. I finish my routine at 30 reps. I am considering doing half pull ups to a count of 50. I hope this might cause improvement in the max pull ups in the first set.  Please help. 
3828,How would I go about jogging part of my commute back to home?,"I work at 8.5 km from home. I often take my bicycle (about 30-35 minutes), but when the weather itself looks like it would rain, I take the bus or get a lift from my parents.  The bus on the way home stops about halfway, 4 km from my home, which I can and have walked before. the path goes via a pretty busy road, but it has a sidewalk for about 90% of the way, and a cycling lane for the remaining 10%, and every busy intersection I need to cross has traffic lights. the road itself is mostly level, although the last KM has a slight decline. I've made a google maps that shows the path (not quite to my house, I'm not that stupid): [website]My bus stops at the hospital. I can make a transfer there to a bus that follows the same trajectory, but depending on the time I arrive at the hospital, it's often just as fast to walk. However, I'm thinking jogging might even be a feasible alternative, given the relatively short distance and acceptable road conditions. What I'm wondering about is if I would need any special equipment or training to jog this part. Do I need special shoes and clothes or can I do this in my normal working clothes (button-down shirt, jeans or other comfortable pants, pretty casual shoes)? Would I need any particular training or excercise before I do this (I don't have an amazing or even great condition, but I can do multi hour bicycle rides of 40-50 km)? Is it sane to start with a 4 km jog right away or should I start with taking the bus and going from somewhere partway? "
3829,What should I be looking for in bio monitors?,"I recently got an android phone and with the power of technology I hope that added data on how my body is reacting to exercise may give me insights into what my fitness regimen may be missing.  What should I be looking for, data gathering wise, in monitors and attachments?  What capabilities and technologies are available for gathering and organizing bio-metric data?  With accelerometers built into most everything step tracking should be pretty straight forward, but what about heart rate, blood oxygen, blood pressure, etc?   "
3830,"Stride, heart, respiration in sync when running... What's this called?","Background: I wasn't the fittest kid -- still not as an adult -- and I wasn't fond of running, as I'd get exhausted quickly and/or get a side-ache/stitch. In general I avoided exerting myself.  On one occasion, when I was about 10 years old, I remember running home from school and not getting exhausted at all. This was about 1 mile. Normally, I could only get to maybe a 1/3 of a mile before I was out of breath and had to walk.  This really surprised me and I tried repeating it multiple times without success.  It felt as though my stride + heart + respiration were all in ""sync"", figuratively. But I couldn't figure out how to ""resync"" them.  Question: Is there a term for this? And/or training to improve it? "
3831,How to gain weight despite doing lots of endurance training,"I'm 6.5 feet and only weight about 160-170lbs. My nutrition is very healthy and I eat a lot - seriously a lot. I found some good websites with good recipes for a healthy way of life. Fish, Meat, Milk, Egg all important things are included.  However, I'm not able to gain weight. This might be due to my endurance training, which sums up to a lot. I usually go running once/twice a week (10km-15km) - not because I need to but I want to. I also go swimming (once a week, sometimes every two weeks) and play football/badminton and other sports. I also cycle to and from work and so on...  I really don't want to stop this endurance training but I don't want to look skinny anymore. I go to the gym on regulary base (2-split, twice a week = 4 times a week) and prefer doing excercices with a lot of weights and less reputations. This increases my strength, but neither am I gaining weight nor do I get bigger muscles.  Do I really need to stop eating healthy or doing endurance training for getting some weight? Should I start to eat like a pig? Box of eggs every day, 20 fruits, kg of pasta or what can I do? "
3832,Unable to maintain same reps through all the sets of an exercise,"In the gym, I stick to 3 to 4 sets (4 sets for compound exercies and 3 sets for isolation exercises) of 10 reps each. But the problem is I'm unable to maintain 10 reps in 2nd and 3rd sets.  I'm taking around 2min rest between the sets. During the 10th rep of the 1st set, I feel that I could do 2-3 more reps.   Of course, in order to reach my target 10 reps, at the end, I'm trying to cheat the reps by improper technique (using other muscle groups, using momentum etc.) or by doing incomplete reps.   which one is better for hypertrophy, to do 10 reps in the 1st set, 8 in 2nd &amp; 6-7 in 3rd (or) 10 through out all the sets? Should I decrease my resistance (weight)?   Another problem during my workout in gym is there is significant drop in my performance in later exercises. Let me explain this with an example:  I do pulls/chinups first (3 sets of 10 but I won't be able to maintain 10 reps through all three sets) then after doing non upper body exercies when I do standing barbell presses, the weight I could press drops dramatically. Its because of those chinups/pull ups.   How to maintain good performance through out all the exercises? "
3833,Does having long pauses (several hours vs minutes) between weight lifting sets reduce or improve the exercise results?,"I want to do weight lifting sets through the day, instead of the one after another. Does this have any difference? As i understand the pause between sets needed for the muscles to recharge energy.  So maybe having longer pauses actually have some benefits? Or at least there is no difference? "
3834,"Abstain from exercise the day after a ""drinking night""?","I consider it common sense to avoid exercise after a night of two beers (Kingfisher Strongs in 650ml containers with 8% alcohol content). The day after drinking, I feel weaker and stiffer and get cramps for days if I do my usual effort in exercise.  But is ""day after"" exercise a bad idea no matter the quantity of alcohol consumed? Yesterday I had 500ml of the same stuff and I felt it best to not exercise today. What is the recommended way of regaining my pace after drinking? "
3835,"Would only doing exercises on a regular basis, without worry about anything else, help grow muscle?","I'm male 24. I'm occupied with my office work so I'm trying to minimize the effort in exercise as best as I could. This means that I don't go to the gym, and I don't buy any equipment. The only thing I can do is making it as a habit in a daily basis, and make it harder everyday. In my ""definition"", a simple plan is a plan that I don't need to remember or look up at all. My current plan follows this formula: ""yesterday I did x in exercise 1, y in exercise 2, so today I'm going to do x+1 and y+1"". After every 20 days, I add a new exercise, so ultimately I will do every exercise. I only do the workout on a specific time in a day (around 6 pm). I don't have any set, just focus to finish one exercise, then take a rest, then move on to another one.  Since I know this plan is to way simple, so I have set my mind that it can take year(s) for me to see the result, and time frame is not my worry. I haven't changed my diet, because I think it's starting to be complex, and more over I don't eat much fat or fried food. I have been doing this for about two months, and I can see how my body changes via the mirror.   Q: However, when looking down I barely see any different. If I stick to this plan, can my muscle be sharper in the future? Or do I have to take care with my diet, or follow a good program?  "
3836,Foot muscle weakness related to overpronation,"I've come to the conclusion that an excessive overpronation partly is a problem related to the weakness of the foot muscles and in particular:   Intrinsic foot muscles (abductor hallucis, flexor digitorum brevis etc.) Weak posterior tibialis Weak anterior tibialis Weak peroneus longus Weak extrinsic foot muscles (flexor hallucis longus, flexor digitorum longus)   Now I need some guidance with exercises that strengthens these muscles. So far my plan is to:   Transition to minimalist shoes for everyday wear(already made but haven't run in them yet) Various balance plate exercises   Balancing, throw a ball to a wall, squats, etc.   Short foot exercises(But right now these are VERY hard to do(unable to)) Links: [website][website]Calf raises   Is this enough to tackle all of the muscles mentioned above or do I need additional exercises/techniques?

I am 1.58 (5'2.5) and weight 53kg (120 lbs). I am not overweight but I am as I like to call it, skinnyfat. I have extra body fat I would lik to lose! I'm usually a 110 - 115 lbs.   I've been running everyday for 9 days and I've seen great result on my belly but I still weight the same! I also have very strong calves and thighs, but they've always been very muscular.   My question is, how can I change my diet to lose body fat? I love love love bread, rice and pasta and have atleast a slice of bread everyday. But I tried cutting out fatty meat, bread and such for about two months now. This does not work out with my hair and nails. I lose alot of hair in the shower, and my nails have been splitting and breaking for weeks now.  My hair is usually very strong and silky, and my nails are also very very strong.   And how do I teach myself to eat smaller portions? I tend to over eat alot.  "
3838,Eating before workout,"My coach tells me that I shouldn't eat before going for a swim session. But I feel hungry during the session.  The routine I follow in the session is: 1 to 2 hours of Jogging and Floor exercises(own body weight or weight training). It mostly lies in the range of 90 mins. After which, we get down into the pool and swim for 90 mins to 120 mins.  What shall I eat just before the session starts? How heavy shall I eat? I am expecting answers related to swimming as it is involved and that is the main workout in the session.  "
3839,Should cows milk be avoided during periods of heavy exertion?,"Assuming you are not lactose intolerant, does milk have any specific negative effects on you during heavy exertion?  We're not talking about milk calories or fat related to weight loss.  Does milk itself contain components that would affect your performance, to an extent that milk should be avoided?  For example, say someone participates in a high-school marching band where they practice drills outdoors for 6-8 hours a day, 5 days a week during practice season.  This is outdoors during the summer, with temperatures in the 80s-90s Fahrenheit.  I've heard that milk ""curdles"" in your stomach during long periods of heavy exertion and can cause nausea.  This seems implausible to me.   "
3840,Why do I get more tired by walking than by running,I have been doing a jogging training program for four weeks now and I can easily jog for 30 minutes.

Is this normal? Could anyone explain why this happens?  Thank you.  
3841,"Sets all at once vs. ""grease the groove""","I'm looking to increase my number of consecutive pushups from about 13 to at least 25.   I've heard of basically two competing approaches:   Do sets all at once a few times a week, as in the One Hundred Pushups program. ""Grease the groove"" by doing sets of pushups spread out throughout the day.   Clearly the second approach gets you more pushups overall, but the muscles would have more time to rest between sets.

3843,Isotonic water in the morning?,"I am building mass and drinking about 3-5 liters water daily.  I sweat much so I lose much minerals particularly when doing any sport.  If I drink tap water during sport, I start to feel very weak.  So I drink isotonic water instead (3 tea spoons of salt and 4 tea spoon of sugar per liter of water).   I started to think if isotonic water is also better to start your metabolism and support your immune system.  I drink every morning normally one liter of tap water, take 400 mg magnesium, take 20 mg proteins, and walk 15-25 minutes in nature before doing anything else. I have an intuition that isotonic water can also be better in starting your morning.   I think what is the appropriate type of water for you depends on your amount of sweating generally.  So I think for me isotonic water is better in the morning too.  Is isotonic water better in a person sweating much generally?  What do you think about isotonic water in starting your morning? "
3844,Ketone bodies vs glycogen cycle,"I'm doing some analysis about the body deriving energy from ketones vs glycogen. I'm looking for data about how much more/less (I'm guessing less) ketone use is vs glycogen in terms of oxygen consumption. I know our body's RQ when running off fat (i.e, ketone bodies) is .70 vs 1 on glycogen, but how does the cycle look? How do ketones actually turn into ATP? How much oxygen is consumed in that process? "
3845,Is long distance running harmful for women?,"I was considering taking part in marathon, but recently I came across this article. To summarize, the author claims that long distance running, and actually any cardio done for hours  at or above 65 percent of your max heart rate, is harmful particularly for females as it devastates their metabolism.     Studies—both clinical and observational—make a compelling case that too much cardio can impair the production of the thyroid hormone T3, its effectiveness and metabolism[1-11], particularly when accompanied by caloric restriction, an all too common practice.    ...     When T3 levels are normal, the body burns enough energy to stay warm, and muscles function at moderate efficiency. When there’s too much thyroid hormone (hyperthyroidism), the body goes into a state where weight gain is almost impossible. Too little T3 (hypothyroidism), and the body accumulates body fat with ease, almost regardless of physical activity level. Women inadvertently put themselves into a hypothyroid condition when they perform so much steady-state cardio.   Then he also makes a point that too much running causes muscle loss that in turn might be detrimental to general health.  A couple of years ago I did 3 half-marathons, and I must admit, although I trained a lot I remained chunky. Shortly after my runs I switched to non-mixing diet as well as removed all processed food from my diet and without any regular physical activity I lost 8kg. I concluded that it was the wrong diet that didn't help me lose weight while running. But after reading the above article it makes me think that maybe it was due to running and metabolism?  My question is: are the claims that running ruins metabolism true? I am aware that there are many myths around that females should not do plenty of sports, but this author is making a strong claim about cardio while promoting other activities in the gym like weightlifting (throughout his website, not explicitly in the article). Another thing is that I was considering marathon mainly as a challenge and a test for my endurance as I am not interested in losing weight anymore. But then the muscle loss might occur which is definitely not my goal. If the metabolism and muscle loss claims true, then running doesn't seem healthy to me anymore - is it correct or am I missing something? "
3846,Questions on the effectiveness and safety of weighted pistol squats,I recently stopped doing front squats due to bicep tendonitis in my left arm and I peaked at 215 for 5 reps. So now since I am unable to do front squats due to this tendonitis I have picked up pistol squats. Currently I am able to do 30 lbs for 5 reps.   I have three questions   Are pistol squats as good for leg strength gains and muscular hypertrophy as front or back squats are as it requires far more balance so not as much weight can be used. Reason I ask is I don't feel any DOMs the next day after doing them. Are weighted pistol squats safe for the knee? Sometimes I worry I might tear something in my knee as I go ass to grass. Would doing pistol squats improve my front or back squat max if I were ever to do these exercises again? If so is there formula to find my front/back max from my pistol max?   Thanks. 
3847,Sprint training for long distance,"I am going to participate in a half marathon in the 1st week of July and 3/4 Ironman in the 2nd week of July. I am training 11 sessions a week. 8 sessions of swimming with lot of floor exercises before it. 3 sessions of running. Let us not bother about my cycling for now.    Out of the 3 sessions of running, one is Interval training       5 mins of warm up run, 4 intervals of 1 min/2 min slow/fast run and 5 mins of cool down.     one is Recovery run, the day next to the interval training.     slow casually paced 4 to 5 km run.   Now the 3rd session is what I am thinking about. Shall I make it a sprint training with spike shoes on? Will it work good? If yes what regime shall I follow? If not what should I do in that session? If required I can cut one swim session and make it a run session.  Please comment if more info needed from my side. "
3848,Treadmill running shoes recommendation,I haven't really exercised for quite a few years now and I'd like to get back on the bandwagon this year starting with some treadmill running (along with some other gym based things like ellipticals and bikes)  What type of running shoes would be good for an amateur runner with extremely flat feet? What types of things should I be considering when looking for shoes? 
3849,Is it possible to lose 3 pounds of FAT per week?,"I have a lot of fat lose. I weigh 210 pounds, and I was hoping to start losing weight (42 pounds of fat to be precise). According to my calculations, to do this in 14 weeks I need to lose 3 pounds per week with a 1500 calorie/day deficit (750 less intake + 500 cardio + 250 weightlifting).  But people keep saying that if you want to lose only fat and not muscle, the most you can lose is 2 pounds/week (MAX).  What do you think? Is it theoretically possible to lose 3 pounds of fat per week? Or not?  Can I do it over 14 weeks (3 per week) or will I have to increase the duration to 21 weeks (2 per week) or even more?  I'm male, 5""8', 210 lbs with more than 23% body fat. "
3850,Balancing StrongLifts with other workouts,"I am very eager to start StrongLifts 5X5, but am apprehensive about how to balance it with my other physical activities. I know that recovery is key to the program’s success.   Background  I am a fit female in my 20s. My goal is to build a better base of functional strength, but I have no insane lifting aspirations. I’m a novice recreational boxer and avid longtime equestrian, so my workouts need to fit those athletic goals.   Here is the proposed schedule.    Sun: Core (~30 min)  Mon: Box &amp; intervals (~60 min)  Tues: StrongLifts  Wed: Core (~20 min) Thurs: StrongLifts Fri: Box (~50-80 min) Sat: StrongLifts   The amount of core work is needed for my riding. So far I’ve been using those days as “recovery” because, while quite difficult, those workouts no longer wear me out. Boxing is a challenging mix of circuit conditioning and actual punch work, but I am reasonably accustomed to it.  This schedule is not any more “workout time” than I’m currently doing (and I’d be dropping steady-state cardio and dumbbell work that I now realize was a bit pointless), but still I wonder if there’s not enough recovery.   Questions   Is this schedule unreasonable? Should I drop StrongLifts to twice weekly in light of all these other activities? Currently, I’m also doing a lot of pushup and chin-up work every other day (basically greasing the groove) and am unsure of how to combine that with this already rather packed schedule. Would it be crazy to add pushups and chin-ups to StrongLifts? Should I wait until I’m satisfied with my strength in those exercises to start StrongLifts? 3.  "
3851,Weaning myself off unhealthy cereal,"In general, I'm comfortable with my diet. The one thing I'm conscious of is the fact that I eat the same chocolate breakfast cereal (Weetos) every day (and I mean every day.) It's been like that for as long as I can remember (I'm 18.) I'd like to wean myself off it eventually so I'm eating healthier breakfasts. The problem isn't just willpower, but culinary - I don't know what else is good to eat in the morning because I invariably eat sugary cereal. So I'm asking two questions:  1) How can I make myself eat less of this cereal?  2) What are healthy, tasty, minimum effort alternatives for breakfast? "
3852,Differences in recovery time (after weight lifting) versus age,"I am now 40. I did some weight lifting about 15 years ago and it was fun. I am now back into it, focusing on strength and muscle gain. I obviously don't expect to become a Mr Olympia, but I find it much more fun to do the exercises with the goal in mind of becoming stronger and have bigger shoulders.  I don't know if it might be a subjective impression, but I don't remember to need so much time for recovery after a hard training (on the 3rd day after a shoulders and deltoids training I still feel it).  Is there any kind of relation between the time needed for recovering and the age? That is important: Your muscles aren't supposed to grow if you don't allow them to rest long enough, namely at least a couple of days between trainings when you are in your 20s. If the times needed are longer (then, how much longer?) for a man in his 40s, then the usual routines for strength and muscle gain will not work, and you need to adapt them somehow.  Additionally, any other clue about how to adapt the routines to a somewhat aged body (well, apart from being more carefully and progressive with the increasing weights of course) are welcome. Might it work if I simply use the normal workouts and insert additional rest days (or days of soft aerobic work) in between?    Later edit:  From the answer below by Berin Loritsch, and also from this other answer I am gradually becoming aware of the following thing: at least at the age of 40 it will be much more useful to stop worrying about it and simply go to the gym and work your butt off like hell!  But anyway, the question is interesting, and I am willing to accept the most useful answer. "
3853,Is it possible to measure calorie burn from heart rate alone?,"I have a Polar heart rate monitor chest strap, and a compatible Android phone on which I can run a number of different apps for recording my heart rate. My primary interest is in how many calories I am burning during any one exercise. I play a variety of sports and run regularly.  What concerns me is that just about every app I've tried comes with an option to select a type of exercise, and then it will calculate different calorie burn rates.  Worse, these different calorie burn rates seem to be derived from a lot of assumptions about how much a person would burn doing these activities, not what I'm actually doing. As a test, I've tried connecting the heart rate monitor, choosing an activity, like ""team sports"" or ""rock climbing"", and then just standing there without moving. Regardless of the fact that I'm not actually doing anything, each app shows me burning calories fairly aggressively, as if I were engaged in that activity.  What I really want is an objective measure, something that doesn't try and make guesses based on the type of workout I'm doing, and lets me know what the most likely minimum calorie burn I am doing given my current exertion level, as measured by my heart rate. And, of course, taking in some known measurements about me, such as my height, weight, and age. Maybe GPS and pedometer as well, but whatever measurements it uses, it should be objective and not assumed.  I saw this related question, which leads me to believe that it should be possible to only use heart rate, and yet I can't find an app for Android that does that.  Is it actually not possible? Is there a reason why these apps are all making up numbers and not just going with the heart rate input? "
3854,difference between gym weights and home weights,"at home I have a york fitness bar and york weight plates...the bar is 5kg I believe...I stack 4x10kg plates and 2x5kg plates on there for a total of 50kg. Now at the gym the bar is 20kg, but it is quite long and thicker. When I add just two 5kg plates, it feels heavier than the ones I have at home, why is this? surely the fact that it is thicker requiring stronger grip doesn't make that much of a difference, if I add 2 10kg plates, it gets really hard, yet at home it is easy...why is it like that? "
3855,Improve running style,"Recently I started running (never ran before for longer than 1 or 2 kilometers, or maybe just few times). After 2 weeks of 3x5 Km plus last time 8 km my right knee started hurting so I stopped. The pain disappeared after few weeks of no running but directly came back when I ran again once for 4 km. Then I discovered that the shoes I had caused that pain even when I used them for walking to the next convenience store. So I went to an Asics shop, made a foot test and discovered that I had a severe overpronation combined with heel strike. I bought stabilizing shoes and tried them once but some of the pain came back during the running. 2 days later I tried to run and focus on landing on Midfoot . The result was great, ran for 3 km and no pain at all.  Now my question is:  I want to adopt this running style, but when I run with it, I can't control my speed and start running a little bit faster, which makes me tired faster. So how is it possible to change one's running style without having to focus on it during running. And is there a way to reduce the overpronation?  I am 187 cm tall and my weight is 91 kilos. "
3856,calorie restriction connection to muscle building,"I am about average weight (145 pounds, 170cm tall) and about 2 months ago I joined gym and doing 1 hour cardio (pretty intense) then 1 hour lifting (targeting each different muscle group, really push myself) about 5 times a week,I try to eat around 1200-1400 cals everyday with 80-100g of protein. my primary aim is to lose weight and gain muscle and have that sexy shredded look. I haven't been weighing myself to avoid disappointment but have noticed ive lost weight and gained some muscle. However ive read limiting calories makes it nearly impossible to gain muscle, I reliase I am gaining muscle now as im new to it so its easy to gain muscle but how long will this last for? how can I continue to gain muscle &amp; lose weight without increasing my calories then leading to weight gain?

3858,Progressive overload vs. greasing the groove,"I want increase my endurance with bodyweight exercises including pull-ups, push-ups, sit-ups etc.  Would it be better to use progressive overload and start at, for example: 3x4 reps for Pull-ups and progress by an extra rep per set every day until I get to my max (say 3x8) and then rest for a day and resume...  or...  grease the groove: do single sets of low reps (for example 3 reps a go) throughout the day. So for example, every time I walk into my room, do 3 pull ups.  or...  a combination of the two: grease the groove with 2 pull-ups a go on the first day, 3 pull-ups a go on the second day, 4 on the third etc. until I reach the point where I'm doing 1 under my max every day and then have a day or two rest and resume?  Also, from what I've read about greasing the groove, it's just making your muscles more efficient - so surely gtg will only work for a certain period of time before you're muscles are as efficient as they can be - maybe then is the time to swap to progressive overload? "
3859,Can working out hard for a few years ruin your mucles/joints,"I have been working out for about 11 years (I am 37) but the past five years have been harder Crossfit Style workouts. I was the leanest and strongest that I have ever been and LOVED them....but a naggig back pain caused me to stop about six weeks ago from those workouts. Since then I have been doing cardio stuff (biking, swimming) and trying to get some weight classses in at the gym but I am gaining weight, feeling sore and sluggish all the time and not sleeping as well. I am eating really clean right now to combat the drop in exercise. Could I have worked out my body so much in the past 11 years that now that I stopped it just doesn't want to do anything else? I am worried that I am still young and have my whole life ahead of me but can't find anything that I can do right now. Any thoughts?  "
3860,Does sitting for longer hours really have an effect on the body?,"After going through this link I am confused about whether to believe what the link claims. If it's true then most of us are affected already because most of us are doing desk jobs from 9-5 or simply sitting in front of the system.  According to this site it says sitting for longer hours reduces the positive effect on the muscles even after going to the gym. By that logic, aren't we to the risk of accumulating a lot of bad fat in the body  If at all its true then what are the ways to overcome it? "
3861,Which muscle training is most effective to burn fat on an untrained person?,"I need to reduce my body fat back to healthy levels.  The general condition is not nice either (overweight, not well trained...), but I am focussing on the body fat.  I noticed that just doing some simple but intensive muscle training (eg. crunches) has far better short term effects than cardio training.  As far as I understand this strategy is not generally bad, as additional muscles help to burn more fat in the long run.    However, I have read somewhere, that crunches are less efficient, as the muscles trained are relatively small and that one should train larger muscle groups.    Question: Given the same training intensity and duration, can I achieve higher fat burning by focussing on certain muscle groups?  And if so, which? "
3862,Is controlled release of muscle contraction more beneficial than free release?,"I used to think that best way to train a muscle is to do reps very slowly, but from the ACSM's manual I learned that it is a myth. Now that made me wonder about controlled release of muscle contraction (the latter half of a repetition). i.e. lowering your body down in controlled manner in a pullup/chinup, lowering the dumbell in a controlled way in dumbbell curls, for example.  Is controlled release of muscle contraction more beneficial (what ever your training goal may be) than free release? If it is beneficial, how beneficial would it be? Because, there will be a trade off between no. of reps &amp; this controlled release technique. I mean for any weight training exercise, you'll be able to perform less no. of reps if you are doing this controlled release thing.  "
3863,circuit weight training and total weight used,"I have a question regarding circuit training.  I have been reading on circuit training, and it seems optimal for my routine as I don't have much time to spare at the moment but would like to fit in say 30 minutes of resistance training when I can manage.  Given they can target the full body, I think they would be ideal.  Would one use the same weight-total for all stations, or do you change them?  For example, if I start with a 5kg dumbell, do I continue with it, or would I change it based on exercise?  Given that most circuits expect you to jump from one station to another in seconds, changing weights would prove quite time consuming I guess, thats why I'm asking.  Also any opinions on circuit-training in general would be appreciated, as well as any sample workout templates for beginners like me :) "
3864,plank shakes - what does it mean?,I have been doing plank hold in good form since atleast 2-3 months. I get shakey after 10 seconds even though I can hold it between 60-75 seconds. I don't see any improvement in shakiness.  What does it mean? Is it Weak core? 
3865,Chewing refined grains - good or bad?,"I know I probably have misunderstood something about the whole digestive process, but one concept still remains unclear to me about it.  They say that chewing is good, as it predigests your food into small pieces and partially liquefies it, making it easier to digest and break down your food faster. It is also particularly essential for getting all the vitamins and nutrients from the food. OK, makes sense.  On the other hand, we have highly processed, refined grains, for which they say the body absorbs them very fast, which means all the carbohydrates are quickly digested, blood sugar quickly peaks, and a lot of the unused sugars get stored as fat. Thus, less-processed starchy foods come more recommended, as they're more filling than refined ones and it takes longer to digest, so more of the sugars get used and not converted into fat for storage. Makes a lot of sense as well.  Now, does it all mean that if there are no nutrients to be gained, and food contains a lot of carbohydrates (I know we shouldn't really eat such foods), it actually makes sense to not to chew that food so much? For instance, if we do eat highly processed grains, like pasta from refined white flour, would it make sense to actually skip a lot chewing - would it result in gaining less calories? "
3866,how long does it take for food to convert to fat?,If I ate two pounds of food and then was immediately there after subjected to a hydrostatic body fat my suspicion is that that food would not count as body fat since it wouldn't have had the chance to convert to body fat yet.  Assuming that that's correct than how long would it take for it to turn into fat? A day? Two days? A few hours? 
3867,Chest/shoulder pain while running,"I am an on and off runner and this summer I took up running again. After chest pain began to show up, I saw a doctor to get it checked out. Heart issues were ruled out.  The pain is kind of a sore feeling across the top of my chest and is accompanied by muscle knots in my shoulders and sometimes in my pecs. For this reason, the doc thinks it's musculoskeletal in nature. It sometimes lasts for several days (though the pain fluctuates a good bit during the day) and is exacerbated by running.  Has anyone had a similar kind of problem or could shed light on what might be causing it? Could running form be the problem? "
3868,"How does the fitness flex define ""active time""","It measures ""very active time"" in addition to steps, but I have no idea what that means.  Assuming it's based on ""lots of arm movement, does that mean that it'll pick up jogging, but not a stationary bike?  Is there some way to tell it I'm (finally, at long last) working out? "
3869,Effect of exercise on overall heart rate,"I recently learned about Kleiber's law describing how metabolic rate is related to an animal's mass.  One way this law gets (over)simplified is by saying that all animals have the same number of heartbeats and small animals just use them up faster than large animals.  This got me wondering- how does exercise rate affect this?  If I exercise a lot do I use up my total number of heartbeats faster or slower?    Or, phrased a bit more scientifically, does exercise increase or decrease my total average lifetime heartrate?  I know that exercise causes it to increase during exercise and decrease during rest compared to someone who doesn't exercise. Does the increase on one side cancel out the decrease on the other side or does it on average increase or decrease?  I suspect there is some good academic research on this but I couldn't find it.  Hopefully one of you with more expertise in the field will have a better idea of what terms to throw into Google. "
3870,"Actual amount of calories, I'm burning when riding bike","I've just finished my first GPS-tracked bicycle workout. I tracked my ""achievements"" using two different sport trackers -- Endomondo and Runastic (I'm using both in the same time purely for testing purposes).  Results reported by both sport trackers (distance, time, speeds) are nearly the same, except for number of calories, that I burned. Endomondo shows value twice as big, claiming that I burned 609 calories, while Runastic reports only 328.  I expected to find some differences, as calories burnout is a value, that can't be measured with high precise (at least in these circumstances), but having these values twice as big actually surprised me.  My workout was 45 minutes cycling, on 10,5 km distance. I'm 181 cm and my weight is 120 kg (metric).  This question is not releated to some problems in any of these sport trackers software. I'm precisely asking, which of these two presented values is (should be) more close to reality? Basing on above workout parameters, how many calories should I burn? "
3871,"Do body fat scales get more accurate with price, and if so, how exactly?","I'm currently considering getting a body fat scale that uses electrical impedance for my home. I understand about how body fat scales are a better measure of progress between measurements than absolute measurements, and how one needs to measure with consistent conditions for meaningful comparisons. I've been using a body fat scale at my gym for years.  I've noticed that while prices vary widely, there are essentially three levels of price. The very low end ones you just stand on, and have simple LCD displays. Next up from that are the ones that have a retractable handle to hold onto so that the electrical signal goes through your arms as well as your legs. The third level is for a full stand unit, with large video screens and the ability to connect to printers and other peripherals. There are also some other features that can be found at any level, like Bluetooth connectivity to one's phone.  At their core, if you strip away the screens and peripherals, they're all essentially the same thing: a set of electrically conductive pads along with a chip for measuring the electrical signals transmitted through one's body.  From that perspective, is there any reason to believe that these devices get meaningfully better as you go up in price? Or are you just paying for the housing and fancy screens? Is there anything about the strength of signal or the quality of the conductive surfaces that would be important in terms of quality?  It seems to me that it would be good to get a unit with hand sensors as well, but beyond that, is there anything else about one of these devices that I should be looking for in order to get the most accuracy? "
3872,Foot arches flatten during lunges,"I find my right foot arch tends to flatten during lunges. How can I hold my arches? Any cues?  There is no pain associated with this.  I have imbalance of strength in both hips and legs. So, I incorporated single leg exercises in addition to squats and deadlifts.... "
3873,Mild left shoulder pain while squatting low bar,"I am on stronglift 5*5 and as the weight is increasing with each workout, squats are getting challenging, while the program is really good, I want to keep doing it and avoid any injuries. The other day after squatting I felt some pain in my left shoulder, it got me worried about my form. After watching a few videos, I think my bar position might be causing this pain.   The Mark Ripetoe Video says that the elbows should come back to create that shelf with the posterior deltoid, while this video by OmarIsuf very clearly demonstrates that elbows should be inline with the body.  My question is how do I figure out what is the correct bar position for me? And how does it feel when the bar is correctly positioned.  Another complication is that guys in these videos have fully developed deltoids so they can create that shelf very easily, I am very skinny with almost no deltoids, so it hurts my bones with the weight gets heavy and is wrongly placed. As it had happened while doing high bar on local trainers advice. So please tell me how to perfect the low bar squat.  Thanks! "
3874,Afraid of dropping weight plates on feet,"I recently started powerlifting (Starting Strength), and I have a rather frivolous concern. What if I drop a weight plate on my feet? Between warming up and work sets, there is a lot of loading/unloading and carrying weight plates around. I've been lifting barefoot and am willing to invest in shoes, but in a battle between a 25-lb plate and a pair of Chuck Taylors, I'm sure the plate would still win hands-down.  Am I being a total wuss? Do people actually drop plates on their feet? Would weightlifting shoes provide any real protection? "
3875,"Low bar Squat: Hyper arched back, slight bend in knees and arm position","I got my form checked by a trainer today, he made a couple of good points:  1- Don't arch your lower back too much while coming down.  I looked up online, and this article kind of supports it, although I have no back pain right now, increasing the weights may cause it in future. How can I maintain a neutral spine throughout? There is no uneven loading, and I am not leaning forward, but I compared my form with his on the mirror, what I noticed was he was a bit straighter than me. I will try the big breath technique next time though.  2- Keep a slight bend on your knees when you come up, or it will cause excess load on the knees. Is that even true?  3- Your elbows are coming back, this may be the cause of pain, though I have noticed my right elbow is a bit forward than the left elbow. How do I improve this? Right now I am using a medium grip with elbows pushing down and forward (but I goes away when I squat).  Looking forward to improving my form on the next workout, all your suggestions are welcome. "
3876,How can I improve this workout,"I've been doing a body weight workout that I found on www.nerdfitness.com regularly for a while now (scaling it up as needed), the workout in its current state is as follows:  3 circuits with ~1-2 min rest in between  1 circuit is:  20 body weight squats   15 push-ups    20 standing lunges (10 each leg)    20 dumbbell rows   (with each arm)    ~50-60 sec plank   (but I probably count slow)      30 jumping jacks      I am looking for an exercise to replace the dumbbell rows, I only have a 10 lb bell and its too easy also, the bench I have to use for it is uneven and my form is always effed up.   So I am looking for a replacement for that exercise, but also just general critiques of the routine and what I could do better.   If someone wants to let me know exactly what muscle-groups these exercises target and If there's anything I'm neglecting; that'd be awesome aswell.   EDIT:   Available resources:     I don't have a chin up bar, near my workout area, there is something I can use, but its not near my workout area, but If I just try to do pullups/chinups whenever I think of it, but I also work out that muscle group during my workout, that isn't like to much is it?  I am working out outside on the grass, no tables or anything like that around just that uneven bench I mentioned earlier.   I do have a barbell with some weights, but Is mixing that with body weight a good idea? like the idea is a bunch of exercises quickly, but if i swap out, say the squats, with weighted squats, I can't just go right into whatever weight I want to use right? I have to like work up to it, which would mess the flow up and just take to much time imo. IDK i'm a beginner here.   "
3877,Compression Sleeves/Socks for Achilles Tendonitis,"This year I've been running much more than years past, and I have my first trail half marathon (with 2500' of elevation gain) coming up in 1 week. 3 weeks ago I was running a hilly training run and my Achilles got really tight and painful.  I took it easy for a week, but it keeps flaring up on training runs. I've found lots of ice, and Ibuprofen seems to help some, as well as rolling my calves seems to help... and i've resorted to cross training only these last 2 weeks to give it some rest.  I'm to stubborn to not run my race, and so my question(s) is(are):    Will wearing compression sleeves or socks help with this issue?  Are some brands better for the Achilles tendon than others?  Are socks better than sleeves? Is there any chance wearing compression socks/sleeves would make the issue worse?  "
3878,Does the body process food and supplements the same way?,I am currently progressing through 'Mad Cow' system and I have upped my calorie intake over the past 1 to 2 months. I have a question that I wondered if anyone could shed some light on.  I take about 2 supplement shakes a day along with 3 to 4 meals. Would I be better off having about 5 to 6 meals and dropping the supplements? Does your body process the liquid supplements differently to actual food?   My goal is to build strength / muscle mass. My increase in good carbohydrates and protein is helping me immensely with my lift gains but I just can't help thinking that it may help more if my body has the actual food to process rather than just gulping down my supplement shake. Thanks! 
3879,"Punchbag without boxing gloves, getting a headache","I was using the punchbag at the gym early on Saturday morning, just jab-straight combinations and trying to work on power for the second punch. What I experienced was a pain in my head when I hit the bag full force each time. It was early but I don't think I was dehydrated, and I was just using weightlifting gloves rather than boxing gloves. I wasn't whipping back the second punch, trying to follow through instead with my body weight going forwards.  I was wondering if anybody else has experienced anything similar to this. Am I absorbing some of the impact somehow, like a recoil? Would boxing gloves be a more sensible idea for me?  UPDATE: No issues this weekend. I would say it was down to dehydration that morning. Exhaling as the punch lands, as suggested, worked great. I'm pretty sure I was doing that previously, so it must have been dehydration.  Thanks again! "
3880,How to train the muscles of fingers?,"When I train fingers, I tend to do low rep and too high weights -- this is probably the wrong way to do it! Then next day I can feel some little pain or easily get blisters when skin so sore. I have a lot of climbing buddies whose fingers are like steel (not soft). How to get that kind of fingers? What is the number of reps and the weights and duration of exercises meant to increase the muscles of fingers?  My background        Fingers for intensive sports requiring hands a lot? Recoving from ulnar claw?   Warmups and trainings for Shoulder cuff?   Recovering from scar tissues due to blisters in hands?     "
3881,Running vs Insanity vs P90X,"I am 25yo 170cm x 57kg and I like run I started running 3 years ago, because I wanted to lose weight, so after few months I get rid of 25kg~, after that I continued running more seriously, and I improved and improved...  Actually I run about 250km/month and my 10Km personal best in 39:30..  I workout about 5day/week plus, sometimes on saturday or sunday I practice some low intensity trekking or MTB... In the summer I ""run"" some trail/skytrail... I have a nice form, but nothing ""extreme"", I'm lightweight I can feel the ABS under my skin but I cannot see it...   Lately I feel like I'm annoying to run so I skipped few workouts, and loosen my general form so I would like to try Insanity or P90X workout, for the reasons above and also for a challenge against myself    My main goal is to  improve myself without losing much ""running form"", and if it's possible improve it, and get a better muscle definition!    Between the two (Insanity - P90X), I'm more like towards the first one, mainly because it's more cardio/fitness related and I do not need tools...    here's the questions, assuming my form and my routine   Do you prefer Insanity or P90X?   Do you suggest to continue running instead of Insanity?   Switching from running to Insanity/P90X workout could give a benefits or rather than that worsen my ""running"" form? (speaking of endurance/speed/etc)     Let's assume I switch to Insanity, I can run/MTB/Trekking as well as doing the daily workout? (not every day, and not stressful exercises)    UPDATE  I like the weight I am (last time I checked (september) I had 5.5% body fat), I would like to get a better body definition and, as I said, improve my endurance/speed etc  Said so, acutally I did not have a particular diet, although I did it in in the past.  My regular routine is: eat 5 times a day, breakfast/morning meal/lunch/afternoon meal/dinner, drink about 1lt water in the morning, 1lt water in the afternoon and 1/2lt tea/water in the evening  I live in italy, I have a well rounded diet, I eat everything and especially a lot of vegetables... I don't mind to write the entire diet but I do not want to be lengthy...    I think that the main problem, for me, to completly follow a program like Insanity or P90X is to strictly abide the diet, I live with other people and it could be difficult to manage a particular diet routine, sometimes they just cook something and having a different meal isn't a possibility...

3882,Should I increase dumbbell weight or should I use throughout,"My gym instructor told me to increase my dumbbell weight once I feel comfortable with the current one. If I want muscle growth only to some extent (I mean not much) and maintain my body with proper endurance, toning and flexibility.   Is it OK that i stick to one single weight throughout or should i increase my dumbbell weights periodically as my instructor suggested ?  Can anyone explain the fitness aspects of these two cases?    I m currently doing dumbbell workouts using 5 kg for biceps and triceps and planning to use it for other exercises like chest press, squats, abs etc.    If using the same weight throughout is an option. Can anyone recommend me the proper weight since I'm thinking of buying one at home ?   I m currently 66 kg and 173 cm tall. "
3883,High intensity training schedule during vacation,"I will have a lot of time available for one week and I am thinking how to use this for strength training most effectively.   I am used to three training sessions (Mo-Wed-Fri) with weights and gym rings per week (1-2h), with one day in between for recovery. Now that I have a lot of time available for this week, I would like to do more, but I wonder how I can do this most effectively without risking injuries.    My understanding is that the muscles need the recovery time - does it even make sense to train more? Would it make sense to distribute the training over the whole day into short sessions or is training in one go the better option?  "
3884,What is the next step if physical therapy isnt helping my groin problem,"About 9 months ago I noticed a pain in my lower abdomen whenever I was doing sit ups. It felt similar to the hernia I had the year before, but since there was nothing bulging through, the doctors suggested that it was a groin pull.  I pretty much ignored it and went about my routine of working out, running, and playing basketball. Of course none of that helped and it gradually got worse. Instead of just being in my lower abdomen, I also feel it in my groin and sometimes back further toward my butt.  I stopped working out about 3 months ago and started doing physical therapy (with a physical therapist, not just doing it myself). We do all sorts of stretches and some light strength training.  I have only been doing it for about 6 weeks (which is how long the doctor suggested I should do it), but at this point it hasn't helped at all. I do the training I was told to do at home and meet with them twice a week, but the pain hasn't improved.  The therapist said that the doctor might want to do a plasma-rich blood injection. In theory, that should stimulate healing in my groin. From what I have read, it is kind of up in the air whether or not that is a real solution or if it is just a theory being put in to practice.  Has anyone had a plasma injection before? Did it help? Is there anything else I should be doing to fix this problem? What should I expect from the doctor if PT hasnt helped? This has really been causing me a lot of problems and I don't feel like im any closer to fixing it. "
3885,Why do you have a lower heart rate while training in the pool?,1) I've read that your heart rate is lower in the pool. Why is this?  2) Also how does the lower heart rate impact your cardiovascular health? Is it good or bad to that the pool lowers your heart rate? 
3886,What should my heart rate be while running / working out?,"When I run for 8-10 minutes my heart rate goes to 195-200 bpm, I have used several calculators online to determine my maximum heart rate but they all seem to say to my maximum heart rate should be about ~190 bpm. But I keep hitting this high heart rate very quickly.   Should this 195-200 bpm I keep seeing lower the more I run/workout? or should I avoid reaching this high a heart rate because it can be dangerous? Is the max something my body shouldnt be able to go over? And what is an ideal heart rate to train my heart / condition?  I read a lot of conflicting things online and hope someone here can answer these questions or point me in the right direction to help my understanding and workout.  Hopefully the question is clear enough and well placed on this website.   Some info about me, I am 24 years old, 1.9m tall, weigh 75kg and have been a non-smoker for over a year now. "
3887,Consequences of Not Eating Enough Fruits and Vegtables?,"I have never really eaten many vegetables; maybe a few every fortnight (two weeks). I do always manage about 3 pieces of fruit every week.  I have recently changed my life style and now eating healthy and exercising and have daily smoothies with kale, spinach, blue berries, strawberries, black berries, raspberries, banana, etc.  What health benefits would I see from increasing my fruit and veg intake? and what are the consequences of not eating fruit &amp; vegetables?

3888,Insanity Workout: Whey or Nay?,"I'm about 5'10"" 175 lbs doing the Insanity workout, and have been doing it for about a month and half.  I don't want to ""get big"", I want to get cut.  Is there any benefit to taking a whey protein shake after my workout, or is it overrated?  I have never tried it.  (Here is the protein I'm currently eyeing: GNC Whey Protein Platinum)  I've always been skeptical of supplements in general.  My gut feeling is to simply adjust my diet and eat better/take in more protein naturally (fish, chicken, etc).  However, there's no doubt that adding a protein shake is a lot easier than changing one's eating habits; whether it has any benefit, however, is why I'm here.  So whey or nay?  Does adding a whey protein shake after an intense cardio workout have any benefit?  Will it be beneficial in getting toned, or not really? "

3890,Yoga for Flat abdomen,"I have read in many articles that the key for flat abs is weight training. Such as squats and other stuffs and the nutrition too. But I have been doing the weight training for a while (approximately 6 months). I wouldn't expect a 6 pack, because this might be a short time period and my diet wasn't that clean enough. But there should be a noticable change. That didn't happen for me. It says pretty much same.  So my question is does Yoga has an effect on abs? I mean i beleive that we dont sweat much or reaches faling point in doing Yoga like weight training (Am I wrong ?).  Does Yoga burns fat as much as weight training do ?  "
3891,making a 70 kg fit body with proper muscle toning,"Myself 21 years old male. I used to weigh 76 kg (height - 174 cm which is still same) earlier 3 or 4 months ago.  As a matter of weight reduction and muscle toning(specially chest and abs)...I started doing some physical activities daily which included        1.  abs streching sideways and backwards.       2.  Simply doing 100 + 80 + 70 jumps..(total 250)       3.  Abs Crunches       4.  push ups ( 15 x 2 normal , 10 x 2 leg raised , 8 x 2 placing fists)       5.  Chin Ups (4 sets)(max 3 per set)   Now. What i have observed i have lost weight to 65 kg and have just become lean and i couldn't see better results in other aspects(perfect shaping or toning within body) other than just weight loss. I used to eat heavily during break fast , medium lunch and much less dinner. I avoided carb foods to greater extent.  Now I m planning to go to a gym (targeting abs , arms and chest) at evening and performing basic yoga at morning including simple activities like meditation , pranayama etc. My main goal is to make a 70 kg fit body with pretty much muscle toning, endurance and flexiblity. Not the massive one we see in wrestlers.  So Here are my following doubts         1. Should I Eat much more and workout to make my body weight reach 70 kg or Should I rely on minimum weights workout at gym with proper resting waiting for my muscles  to grow since i have heard muscles growth leads to weight gain ?        2. Is it good to include yoga during morning along with gym at evening as i've mentioned earlier ?        3. Is der anything i have to consider as i've been doing certain physical activites daily as i've told earlier ?   Please Also feel free to suggest your own ideas by which i can achieve my target from my current condition "

I caveat this request with the fact that I am trying to limit my intake of animal products to a minimum and rely on plant-based protein sources. There is a fair amount of research in the public domain about creatine deficiencies in vegetarians although some say the human body can produce all it needs.

3894,Resistance band deadlifts,"I don't have a bar with heavy weights at home but want to incorporate deadlifts into my workout program. I experimented a bit with dumbbell deadlifts, but the 10 kg dumbbells I used feel very light for me (I just read that a beginner woman could deadlift her bodyweight) and I don't want to buy new dumbbells. So my idea was that I could do the deadlift with resistance bands.   I took a pull-up bar and some strong bands and made something like on the following video but without the weights: [website]Here is a slightly different image of this:    And here is another simple setup: [website]Now I have some questions about this:   Is it possible to get the same benefits from the deadlift using this setup as from a regular deadlift? Is there any risk of doing it this way instead of a regular deadlift? Since the force of the bands increases monotonically with the elongation of the band you have a significantly smaller force at the initiation of the lift compared to the top of the movement. Does this lead to any problems concerning risks or training effects and does it imply changes in technique compared to the normal deadlift? For travelling I can take the bands with me but not the bar. Is there and reasonable way to do deadlifts with bands only? How is the proper technique in this case?   Edit:  Here is a more complex setup of how to use resistance bands for deadlifts:  [website]There is also a more simple version of this but it seems to lead to bad form:  [website]"
3895,exercise that can replace Pull-up?,"I wonder, if there's a way to work out the arms similar to pull-up exercise, but without using pull-up bars?  Indoor exercises are convenient. I could just do push-ups in the living room. However, there's no bar in my flat and also cannot use pull-up bars due to the limit of the doors. I'm afraid only doing push-ups will make my arms unbalanced developed.   Is there a way to work out those ""pull-up muscles""?  "
3896,Are low shoes suitable for running?,"I play basketball, and I would like to improve my running speed and resistance.  I obviously own a pair of basketball shoes, but I wouldn't like to use them outside the pitch to avoid degrading them quickly. I love low shoes and I own a pair of white Onitsuka Tiger, but now I use them only to play football on grass since they won't be clean anymore. I was thinking: can I use them to go running? Would my foot/ankle/leg be hurt if I do this? I'm asking because lots of people said me it's no good.  I went running with them once, but only for 20 minutes since it started raining so I don't know if it is good.  "
3897,what is my rmr?,"I have no idea how many calories im meant to be eating a day to lose weight... Some calculators tell me my maintence is 1400, some 1600 and some even 2200!

(if that's help you determine my body composition)  Goal: lose weight, gain muscle  Regimine: cardio and weight lift, about 4 times a week, but have been slacking off since cutting as I worry I will just eat away at my muscle by working them out so hard and not feeding them enough?  Diet: mainly bread, protein shakes, tuna, yogurt, weight watcher lasagnes, etc. Sometimes smoothies in morn. About 1500 cal.  I get enough protein and sleep  Could anyone tell me my maintence for training days and non training days? Like non training would it be about 1300? and training days 1600? does that sound right? "
3898,Trouble falling asleep after a workout at night,"It started happening a while ago and has been getting worse. I usually workout from 6-7 in the evening (unfortunately can't workout any time before that due to my schedule) and go to bed around 10:30 (3-3:30 hour rest period). My body is very tired but I can't fall asleep. It's a weird feeling, I start to become unconscious but immediately after that I wake up and my body is on full alert (my pulse rate goes up too). This happens several times and could last from minutes to a few hours. But once I do fall asleep, it stays uninterrupted and I don't wake up until the morning after.   I thought the reason could be my high pulse rate, so I went to the cardiologist and they ran several tests including an electrocardiogram as well as ecocardiogram. They were both normal and the doctor said it's probably not the heart.  I've been working out for a while now (mostly weight lifting, rarely any cardio), but it recently started happening as I tried to increase the intensity of my workout. I should probably mention that if I don't workout for a few days, my sleep routine goes back to normal and I don't have any troubles at all falling asleep.  I saw many different articles regarding exercise-induced insomnia but not really sure what else to do at this point. Could it be that maybe my body is low on some particular nutrients? Has anybody else experienced this? It's starting to become an issue for me since it's impacting my school and work life. Any help is appreciated. "

3901,I keep pulling/getting pain in the same muscle even when I don't exercise it,"I pulled a muscle directly under my shoulder blade (dorsal muscles?) a couple of months ago while carrying something heavy - not as I picked it up but as I was walking with it, I felt the muscle ""go"". It recovered well but since then about once a week that muscle will spontaneously start to hurt, as if it has been pulled again. Often, I'm not doing anything at the time, I can just be sitting there and suddenly it ""goes"" again. When it is not sore, I can exercise just fine (pull-ups, press ups, etc, not heavy weights) and this doesn't seem to trigger it.  Often, the pain will suddenly stop just as suddenly, rather than gradually fade.  I assume I've hurt the muscle in the original pull but should I do anything about it? Or is it just taking a long time to heal? "

3903,Overestimated calorie burn on an elliptical,"I'm following a calorie count + elliptical routine for about two weeks now. My average calorie deficit should be about 500, but I don't see ~1 kg weight loss I expected. I'm very accurate at measuring my food intake, so the problem must be the elliptical.  I'm using Torneo Stella C-507M. I'm 25 years old, 1.90 meters height, currently at 125 kg. I use mid-to-high settings with slowly varying programs for about 30-60 minutes, and the calorie burn it shows is correspondingly about 430-760. I usually don't use the handles, but occasionally I do when doing the harder parts if my legs are getting cramped. Is it likely that the machine is overestimating my calorie burn? How do I correct it so that I could get on the track? "
3904,Training load on a diet (am I doing too much?),"I'm 6""1 (187cm) at 194 pounds (88kg) targeting 187 pounds (85kg) and currently eating between 1800 kcal and 2200 kcal daily, with 50 % protein and fat &amp; carbs more or less balanced. I've been doing this for 3 weeks and want to continue for another month. First muscle structures around the abdomen are slowing starting to show, so the way I'm doing things can't be completely wrong.  Now I however read that you should strongly cut your training when on a diet, e.g. train one muscle ground every 6 days in the 6-12 rep range or when doing pure strength excersises (1-3 reps) even take as much as a 10 day break.  Are these recommendation only valid for bodybuilders trying to increase muscle mass at max rate? I'm interested in maintaining 85kg (187kg) longterm as I do love roadbiking, but at the same time I want to increase my strength (less fat, more and stronger muscle).  Currenlty I'm running to the gym on a ""schedule"" similar to this one. I don't have problems performing max strength excersises in the gym, but I rarely manage more than 1-2 sets at full weight and mostly one manage on set in the 8-12 rep range before hitting the big weights. Even then, if I would fully feed managed 10 reps I only manage 8 when on diet.   Push:    Benchpress: 1x15x110 lbs, 1x8x198 lbs, 1x2x246 lbs Low squats (only started 4 month ago): 1x10x88 lbs, 1x10x132 lbs, 1x10x176 lbs, 2x3x231 lbs Standing military press: 2x5x88 lbs, 1x4x110 lbs Dips: 2x10x26 lbs Isolated triceps: 1x10 to finish off my arms   Pull:   Pullups: 1x10x0 lbs, 1x10x44 lbs, 2x6x88 lbs or 1x3x130 lbs pull down with one arm at machine Deadlift (pain for some small back muscle, currently resting): 1x10x110 lbs, 1x10x180lbs, 1x10x220lbs Rowing: 2 sets a 10 reps Dumbbell curls standing: 1x5x50lbs Shrugs Shoulder rotators Reverted butterfly thing: 1x10   Training:   Day 1: Push Day 2: Pull Day 3: Rest or roadbike (25- 45 mi) Day 4: Push Day 5: Pull Day 6: Rest or roadbike (25- 45 mi) Day 7: Push Day 8: see Day 2   (Note due to weather some weeks have no road bike and most only one session)  Even though I'm dieting I'm still progressing in squats and pullups (obviously weight drop helps...), plus I can eat a bit more because of the workout. Should I really reduce my workout? I couldn't eat any less without feeling hungry, and the missing workout would make me feel board, thus leading to eating. "

Or, one may choose a strategy to hike all significant climbs early on in a long distance race.  When choosing to hike up a hill in a running race, is there a specific form or technique that is optimal? For example, what sort of posture should one have? Is there a specific stride length/cadence to aim for? Should you brace your hands on your knees to ""push"" uphill? etc.  Is there a simple rule to determine when it is better to hike rather than run up a given hill (in terms of energy conservation/recovery/not wasting time)? Or if there are multiple hiking techniques or speeds that apply to different situations, is there a strategy for knowing which to use in a given situation? "
3907,Standing desk while working,Because I'm a web developer I usually work about 9-12 hours per day. 2 months ago I was 108kg(238 pounds) and after a hard eating plan and some exercise now I'm 97kg(213 pounds). My height is 1.83m (72.05 in). I'm usually eating about 1500-1800 calories per day and I'm working out about 30-40 minutes with some fitness blender workout kickboxing videos. I'm trying to drop some more kilos but I stucked at 97kg. I've read somewhere that if I'm working on a standing desk I'll lose more calories. Is it true? I can't workout for longer time because of my schedule. I've seen some calculators which showed me that if I'm standing lets say for one hour I'll lose about 250 calories.

3909,Longevity of Fat Adaptation for Endurance Athlete,"I'm an adult male endurance runner, and earlier this year took on a moderately low-carb diet and became fat-adapted. My runs at first were your predictable sufferfest but after 6-8 weeks I got to a point where I ran a 50k ultra without taking in any calories. In previous 50k races I needed to eat carbohydrates to continue.   Then, after a couple of months of this, summer and vacations and stuff happened, and I discontinued the diet. Now it's October, and I'm resuming the low-carb - but my runs are, once again, suffer-fests. Which got me to thinking:  How long did the fat adaptation last after stopping the diet?   Since the fat-adaptation is apparently lost, should I expect it to take another 6-8 weeks to regain it, or will the process be faster the second time? "
3910,Having to clear throat constantly while running?,"I'm an ex-smoker (for roughly 8 years) and have recently, in the last 4 months, started a fairly intense cardio regimen that I'm doing twice a day.  I noticed while running that I'm having to constantly clear my throat. There is no phlem or mucus and I'm not coughing but I have to ""clear it"" and once I do it comes back a minute or two later and I'm having to do the same thing.   Does this sound like my lungs cleaning/repairing themselves or could this be indicative of something else?   Has anyone else experienced this before? "

I have a good physique, however I never had well defined abs. Now I'm working hard towards abs. I do abs workout every other day and cardio after workout. Also started swimming once a week. My diet is healthy as well. Eating less carbs and more high protein foods. Protein shake after workout and early morning. I can notice the difference on my body with the abs workout and cardio.   I workout other body parts as well but not as often. Because I'm spending more time on my abs than other body parts and doing more cardio (25mins), I'm worried I will loss the muscles.

I am trying exposive movements, but does it train the fast twitch fibres in any way? or if there is a special name for this type of training I would like to know the name.  I would be grateful if you suggest more isometric exercises than ones that require weights simply because isometrics are new to me and I would love to try a whole bunch out, thank you :)  The purpose of wanting these if to be able to punch to and kick faster (if the context helps make more accurate/relevant suggestions).

3914,would wearing copper rings cause any toxicity?,"I've been wearing a copper ring in my left hand for more than 2 years and I my friend recently asked me to remove it,saying it will add some toxins into me .Is it true? Or is he is seriously kidding?  "
3915,Is LCHF diet the best and easy way to loose fat?,Does the low carb Atkins type diet really work when it comes to losing fat? Is it better and easier to do than the low fat diet?

3916,Should I run the next race? Or stay out because of my calves?,"What is the best method to get to full recovery here so I can race?  Last Saturday, I ran a 5k race, your typical high school race. After proper cool down for 30 minutes, later that night I biked 30 miles with clips on my road bike. I went fairly easy (only about 13mph avg.) so I thought that this would be like a cooldown or recovery ride.   Sunday I didn't feel too bad.  On Monday, we did a weight workout in the morning with exercises like box jumps, deadlift, (and core). I noticed my calves were a bit clinchy, but nothing bad at all. Pretty typical. Later in the day, we ran a speed workout. I was able to do the speeds but on the recovery jogs, I could hardly get my legs to move, I could really feel the pain in the upper part of the calves. I figured I would just get through this one workout, then I could back it down after.  Next day, waking up my calves were so sore, I couldn't move my leg in any way that used my calf muscle. I went onto bike the next day instead of running.  Day after, I skipped a meet, and took the day off. Coaches advice was to ice them and take ibuprofen 4x12hours. So I iced 2xs the rest of the night   And now today, I biked again, didn't feel as bad, but the pain was still there.  I have tomorrow (Friday) to take easy also...  On Saturday I have one of the bigger races of the season, and I would like to run it, any advice to get me to and through this race?  Thanks! "
3917,"For the same number of repetitions, does it build more muscle to do fewer sets?","Suppose I want to do 50 pushups. I could do:   10 sets of 5 5 sets of 10 2 sets of 25 1 set of 50   Each option is more difficult than the last. But is it more beneficial? Is it ""more pain, more gain"", or would I benefit just as much from the easier sets?  Clarification  As one user pointed out, from a physics perspective, the total amount of work is the same in each case, which is why I asked this question. But my understanding is that building muscle requires damaging it via exercise:      When muscles undergo intense exercise, as from a resistance training   bout, there is trauma to the muscle fibers that is referred to as   muscle injury or damage in scientific investigations   So my question is essentially: ""doing more pushups in a row hurts more - does that mean it causes more damage and thus stimulates more growth?"" For example, does a buildup of lactic acid contribute to damaging the muscle fibers? "
3918,What is good training to extend endurance before hitting the wall,"I'm a cyclist and love the longer rides.  These days I'm pretty careful on nutrition to avoid hitting the wall and if I'm honest haven't actually hit the wall in a while.  I'm informed that endurance can be increased to allow you to go ""longer on less"".  What training techniques are specifically good at increasing this kind of endurance? "
3919,Aerobic vs anaerobic for better fat loss,"I've read in this forum about aerobic and anaerobic training but i can't get an answer for my particular situation.  I'm 35 years, male, 175cm , with 79kg, doing 3 or 4 exercises (2xrunning 5km/500 kcal each and 1xsoccer 1hour/980 kcal) per week, i have some belly fat and overall fat that i want to loose.  I eat rather well, and try to keep a log of the calories that i intake.  I'm trying to understand what's the best way to train so i can loose belly fat.  From what i understand:   Aerobic, will decrease more fat but only during the exercise, after that calorie ""spending"" will decrease and also the metabolism, so i would be spending less calories just on doing my regular daily things. Also aerobic will make me lose some muscles.  Anaerobic will decrease less fat, but after the exercise i will be spending more calories, gain more muscle and increase my metabolism. Downside is that anaerobic training would take more time to lose fat.   What's the best training for losing fat? Aerobic or anaerobic?  I'm doing running and soccer for losing fat, are there better exercises for losing fat?  What kind of training plan do you guys recommend? Mine is obviously failing, in 1 month i lost 1 kg, i decreased my fat percentage by 1,5% and gain 2kg of muscle, which doesn't seem that much.  First i tried running 5km at 150 bpm (average), during 2 weeks and didn't lost 1 kg, right now i'm trying HIIT, in which i run 5km do 7 sprints of 30seconds and another 7 sprints of 15s, but i don't see much results.

3921,swim workouts from swim-a-mile website,"I've just completed the 0 to 1 mile swim program ([website]for a couple of months.  However, I am not quite sure how to interpret the last item of the various workouts. For example, for workout 1, it says Backstroke  5x50 swim, kick, drill, swim. Big hip roll. Does this mean 50m of swimming backstroke, 50m of backstroke kick, 50m of a backstroke drill of my choice and 50m of backstroke swim again? thats only 4x50. is the last 50 of ""big hip roll""?  For workout 2. its Breaststroke 400 drills, swim, pull, kick Is that 100m of each, i.e. one drill, then 100 swim 100 pull 100 kick?  Perhaps there is a general logic to the last part of these workouts that I fail to see.  "
3922,How to keep my leg muscle from increasing in volume while still exercising?,"First, some words on my fitness history:  I was quite a scrawny kid growing up but in high school I joined the high school's Cross-Country team and started running regularly for part of the year.  I found that each year as the season started and I worked on getting back into competition shape I would gain about 10 lbs. and my legs (specifically my thighs) would increase in size.  I thought this was unusual, since distance running is usually associated with toning muscle rather than building it, but building muscle is what happened.  This may be in part due to the fact that I lived in a mountainous part of the country where some of my training runs would often have elevation gains of one hundred to several hundred feet.  We would also incorporate hills into our speed workouts.  Particularly for me, I enjoyed running hills and so would seek them out on my own personal runs.  This may have contributed to the increase in muscle size.  I also lived in a higher-altitude environment (about 4500 - 5000 feet) so the air was thinner. To be more specific: 2005 started Cross-Country, ran summer and fall 2006, spring, tried out lacrosse for a season, wasn't very good. 2006, summer and fall, Cross-Country again 2007, spring, track (1600 m and 3200 m) 2007, summer and fall, Cross-Country again (I sprained my ankle shortly before the season started so I was out of commission for a little while). 2008, spring, track again (1600 m and 3200 m).  I then ran a little bit in spring of 2009 recreationally.  Summer 2009- summer 2011 spent two years in a humid sea-level environment where I did a lot of walking but little running.  I didn't start running again until summer 2013, but didn't get to run very long or very often because I was dealing with shin splints.  There was nowhere flat where I lived so every run consisted of at least a 40 foot elevation change.  However, from spring 2012 to spring 2014 I started biking regularly to school, which I lived about a mile away from and had a significant downhill one way and a significant hill the other way.  I believe my thighs and buttox are disproportionately bigger than the rest of my body.  For instance, I have to buy relaxed fit jeans that are at least 2 inches too big for my hip size just to fit my butt and thighs comfortably into them.  For instance, my thighs measure 27 inches EACH while my hip measures at 36 inches and my waist measures at 35 inches.  I do have some stomach fat, but since my legs increase in size while I was in good physical condition and had almost no fat on my body I am sure that most of my leg size is coming from muscle.    Most of this leg volume was developed running Cross-Country in high school but I believe some more leg volume has been developed in my exercises since and possibly even gained some fat since the beginning of 2012 (that's when my face and body started looking less scrawny and I started getting some stomach fat).  I have been afraid to take up any sort of exercise again in fear that it would again increase my leg size and I would need to buy pants way larger that my waist/hip size just to get my upper leg to fit.    First question: how did my legs get so big?  Was it any particular exercise I did or am I just a genetic anomaly?  Second question:  I now live in a flatter part of the country but I still am planning on biking to school most every day and there is a little bit of a hill.  How should I approach this biking to keep my leg muscle size from increasing?  Third question:  What kind of exercise can I do with my bike that will allow me to burn fat and build strength/endurance without increasing my leg muscle size?  Fourth question: What kind of exercise can I do IN GENERAL that will allow me to burn fat and build strength/endurance without increasing my leg muscle size?  I am a 24 year old male.  I would also prefer exercises that don't take a lot of time (whether in preparation or implementation) since I am in a busy stage of life (aren't we all :)?  ). "
3923,What are the different repetition ranges and for what use?,I read many times here about repetition ranges but I never understood their idea. Why are there different ranges? What are they? And for what purpose should one do?  Also how much weight should one lift for each range? 
3924,Inner thigh strain while squatting,"Let me begin by saying this is not about an injury. There is no pain during or after my workout (apart from the normal feeling of a muscle straining to lift heavy weights). It's simply that my inner thigh seems to be working a lot harder than it used to 20lbs ago.  The feeling runs along my inner thigh as if it could be my sartorius or adductors, but I don't see how either of those are related enough to the squat to be staining during the lift. This makes me wonder if maybe my form is somehow incorrect and as a result an inordinate proportion of the load is being offloaded onto those muscle when it should be on the more major muscles (VM, VL, glutes, etc.). Is there any common form mistake that would result in a load transfer from the prime movers to the sartorius or hip adductors? Or is it that the sartorius or hip adductors are more vital to the squat than I suspected; meaning it is to be expected that they feel strained under a heavy load?  For what it's worth, I'm aiming for a wide stance, low-bar squat. And when I say wide stance I mean like an inch or two more than shoulder width and with feet pointed out 30°. "

Here is my workout: (I am not sure of what weight I use, hence if I don't mention it... I don't know- but its heavy to the point where my 9th or 10th rep is basically impossible)  Seated leg press (100kg, 3 sets, 10 reps per set)  Squats (20kg- cant go up as I find it to hard to get the bar over my head, 3 sets, 10 reps per set)  Leg extension (3 sets, 10 reps)  Leg Press (5 sets, begin at 70kg and go up to 100kg and then back down again- is called doing a pyramid)  Then go onto do calves....

3927,Effect of an asymmetric weight distribution on a hack squat machine,"  In a hack squat machine (see figure above), does it matter if I put more washers on one side? May this asymmetry cause an asymmetry of my effort in performing this exercise?

3928,"Best time to workout without losing weight? (weird question, I know)","I have been overweight before, and over the past year or so, I have 'controlled' my eating habits, by cutting down on processed and junk food and eating food that's better for my body.  I've lost quite a lot of weight now, and I recently started working out. And by workout, I mean body-weight workouts. ([website]I've been sticking to it for a while now, but people are still saying that I'm losing weight (although I do notice a little more muscles on my bicep and more veins on my arms etc.)  I thought it might be because I always work out before breakfast (and I eat afterwards). I did a little Googling, and it is said that working out on an empty stomach can lose more calories. Does this mean it is better for me to exercise after my breakfast?  Oh and yes, I am still on my healthy eating habit. Eating greens, fruits, proper meals (no fast food) and less sugary stuff. May I also add that I'm currently 18, and have a small physique, so I really want to know what's the best plan for me - if I want to get a little bigger - should I continue my healthy eating but instead, eat more?

3929,How to select a workout plan?,"I am 25 years old. I am 6 feet and 2 inches. I weigh 111 kgs. or 244 pounds. I have been exercising on and off for 2 years. I have lost 30 kgs in the mean time.

I can bench press about 50 kilograms (110 pounds) (3 sets of each type - I do 3 types - Each set is of 10 reps). I lift similar weight in my squats.   So, with this type of strength and stamina, what would be the best workout for me ?   There are so many on the internet. It is really confusing. What are the metrics on which I must choose a workout plan from the internet ?   I want to lose weight and develop super human strength. I don't really care about beautiful muscles. I want to be strong enough to fight bears - not that I would. I think they are magnificent creatures.   "
3930,How badly would lower-than-average testosterone affect strength-only gains?,"For males and females.  For this example, I am male, so let's focus on males. First of all, assumptions:  Muscle size is not important to me. I don't feel as though I have to build muscle to be attractive, and I'm fine with my own size, so any benefits/assumptions aside, muscle mass means virtually nada to me. Including this in this mix, a certain figure of testosterone in any assumptions would not hinder goals since building size is not a priority to me, so all figures representing T-levels in this regard are not relevant.   It would be wise not to assume building X specific amount of muscle is a top-priority to me.  What is my priority, you ask? Strength. Studies correlate testosterone with muscle strength in regards to muscle size, yes, but there's no hard evidence that both must go perfectly hand-in-hand to improve one.  In other words, there's no 100% correlation from muscle strength potential to muscle size and mass. Pre-pubescent children have built phenomenal strength with low-testosterone. People who have undergone gonadectomies have not been doomed to succeed in building strength either, although can be very hard.  In short, assuming I have low-testosterone, how limited would I be in building purely strength?  Strength is not just muscle mass but potential: myofibril execution, nervous system, mind/body control, etc.  My current routines/maxes:  Squat: 1 time a week, 3 reps, 50-80 lbs., 100% deep.  Biceps curl: 50-80 lbs., 1-3 reps, 100% perfect form, once or twice a week.  Deadlift max: 280 lbs.  Squat max: 120 lbs.  My goal:  Deadlift max: 600 lbs.  Squat max: 300 lbs.  NOTE: I have absolutely no sexual dysfunction symptoms associated with low-T (but could still have it). Consider this question, to some degree, hypothetical, because I'm assuming I have low-T based on failure to improve much strength. I'm not seeing any physicians/doctors/etc., so don't bother telling me to. "

3932,What exactly does it mean to warm up?,"I've heard many times that warming up lower the risk for injury, but I have no idea why that is.  From the tag warmup     A warm-up is light exercise usually performed before participating in technical sports or exercising. Warm-ups are intended to to get blood flowing to relevant muscles and to ""prime"" muscle memory for technical movements.   I'm wondering in more detail what it means to warm up. Surely blow is already flowing into all my body parts at any one time, or cells would quickly die from hypoxia. And ""priming"" muscles doesn't mean anything to me.  So, what does warming up actually mean? How does one know if one warms up correctly? "
3933,What are realistic strength goals?,"In this question (How do you motivate yourself to keep exercising?) I read it's good practice to set fitness goals.  Because I kept losing motivation and my goal was just to get more muscle, I wanted to set real measurable goals for my fitness gains.  I'd like some short term goals and 1 long term goal.  I'd like to measure these goals for the first excersize I am doing each day.   Pull-ups (currently 4 clean reps) Bench-press (currently max 60 kg, 5 clean reps) Squats (currently max 80 kg, 5 clean reps)   I weigh approx 78 kg and I split my work-out threeway at the moment and my aim is to go too the gym 4 times a week:  Back- biceps chest - tricep shoulder - legs  I am planning to switch these around after 6 weeks of excersize.

3934,Concerned after many squats and suddenly felt sick / super-sleepy / light-headed for 1 whole hour?,"Heavy sickness and tiredness and distant/faint feeling lasted one whole hour - feeling a little faint is normal for squats on a heavy weight obviously, but slightly concerned about length of time this lasted - it felt serious for about 30 mins   Seems really strange. At first wondered if it might be heart attack but no pain in chest  10sets x 10 reps x 90kg rest:60s  But it hit me half way through 3rd set of bench-presses straight after which are normally never any trouble  Starting to feel ok now, but confused as to what just happened and if this is normal. Has anyone else experienced it? I've not experienced anything so severe before and I've done weights in much lower set-numbers 3x8, 3x10 for a long while and go running 1-2 times a week for an hour. Wasn't expecting this. Not sure if I should be concerned or what, literally felt like curling up and going to sleep and like I was close to being sick a lot. Anyone experienced this? Probably not a heart attack since now I feel way better. Just puzzled as to how this feels  Also can find lots of posts of people saying they felt sick - fine, but none for the length of time involved here.   I'm starting to feel a lot better now since starting to write this.  Added: 1RM squats is probably ~120kg        I just went back and completed workout this morning and was fine - have to assume since I'm stil typing was not heart attack. But weirdest thing. Wonder if could have been lactic acid overload or something weird making me sick "

Over the last few years my sister-in-law has picked up running and I feel threatened.  For some reason it feels that if she is also a runner then...what makes me special?  I hate this feeling.  I know that I should just be happy for her wanting to run more but anytime she brings it up I instantly feel unhappy and angry.  I really feel like we could have a great relationship if it wasn't for these feelings that I have been having.  So...is this a normal feeling?

3938,Why do artificial steroids build muscle while artificial leptin does nothing to prevent hunger?,"I've recently been reading about leptin and leptin resistance and I have a question that has been nagging me.  It seems like one of the first things that researchers tried after the discovery of leptin was leptin injections in rats to see if it would suppress hunger.  Instead, the rats get hungrier and that led people to believe that large amounts of leptin could lead to leptin resistance.  My question is, why do steroids (which increase testosterone) work while leptin injections do not work?  From my understanding, steroid users cycle usage to avoid resistance; why can't the same be done with leptin injections?  NOTE: I don't use steroids or advocate for them.  I'm simply wondering why increasing a given hormone seems to work in one situation, but not in another. "
3939,How can the conventional deadlift be harder at the top than the bottom?,"This video is the example I'm talking about in particular. But outside this, I've heard of and seen people having trouble at the top of a deadlift while not having such trouble at the bottom.  To provide some background, I'm 6' 0"" (183 cm) and 175 lbs (80 kg) at 18% bodyfat. This is my ""fat weight"". I have been working out for 15 months. I'm definitely on the weak side; my recent deadlift max is 315 totally raw. Of all the primitive movement patterns, I focus on the deadlift the most to aid in posture correction as well as building a strong base for future powerlifting or strongman.  I've seen a few deadlift here and there who have trouble at the top of a deadlift, yet not at the bottom. At the bottom such a lifter exhibits proper thoracic extension, but it decays before he reaches the top, typically by a flexed (kyphotic) upper thorax, or rolled-forward shoulders. It seems as if he fails to ""lock"" his shoulders back before it's too late to do so. I don't understand, because I would think upper thoracic extension would be the most difficult at the bottom of the lift.  Indeed, when I deadlift, I always have the highest difficulty until I have lifted the bar some eight inches (20 cm). I have a computer-nerd life background, so I tend toward a thoracic flexion (kyphosis) in my upper thorax that I still struggle with. I concentrate strongly on throacic extension particularly in my upper thorax, and especially at the bottom of the lift. But whatever I lift, I know if I can lift it 6-8 inches, I can grind through the rest of the movement, even if slowly, and complete the lift.  As always I have a buddy with years more experience than me spot my form during heavy lifts. For my heaviest lifts they say my thoracic extension (particularly the lordosis I put in my lumbar spine) degrades somewhat as I load my spine but it evens out, the weight moves, and my form remains pretty good for that lift.  Simply said, I don't understand how the top of a deadlift can be harder than the bottom. I also don't understand (as the short guy states in the above video) how one can deadlift more with a deficit than without. Can someone explain this to me? "
